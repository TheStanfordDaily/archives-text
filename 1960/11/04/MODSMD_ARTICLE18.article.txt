# The
						Question of Third Person Responsibility
## 
### JOHN D. BLACK Director, Counseling Testing Center 
Recent comments of students
make clear that the Honor Code
at Stanford faces its greatest chal
lenge on the issue of Third Person
Responsibility, the obligation to
discourage dishonesty in others.
The informer, the stool pigeon i
is a curiously despised creature
in our society, unless he happens
to be spying on Communists or
narcotics addicts. Perhaps this
attitude develops out of the rec
ognition that we all make mis
takes and the hope that some
times we will escape punishment
for them. Then, too, as children
we learned to scorn the "tattle
tale," a child who, because of his
own feelings of inadequacy, de
lighted in getting other children
into trouble.
Unfortunately, perhaps, we are j
no longer children, although our
struggle to be civilized adults con
tinues. When we sinned as chil
dren there was someone there to
punish, and lo forgive. As adults,
each time we stoop to behavior
that is mean or petty or shameful
it has a serious impact on our
self-esteem, our self-image.
These inner effects of our se-1
cret transgressions are usually
subtle but more far-reaching in
their destructive consequences
than the embarrassment or suf
fering we experience when caught
in a despicable act.
These private misdeeds of
thought or action undermine our
always-tenuous feelings of belong
ing to human society. How can
wo deserve friendship, love, re
spect when we do uncivilized, un
charitable, dishonorable things?
And so the stubborn barriers
that separate each of us from the
others are strengthened — and
we become less open, more
guarded, more lonely. Our facade
may remain perfect, but this only
increases our sense of isolation;
we see ourselves as frauds—and
to live a lie for a lifetime is the
worst kind of hell.
To spare someone this fate is
lo perform a humane art. To see
a fellow student stealing or cheat
ing is lo see a man in the act of
destroying himself. To ignore it |
is callous and selfish. To strength- !
en a fellow human being in a mo- ;
ment of weakness is creative.
Pencil tapping by a class when
cheating is observed is an ideal
expression of third person respon
sibility: it is as if the group were
helping one of its number to re
tain his membership, his right to
belong.
But where the crime cannot be
aborted, it is better to force se
cret transgressions into the open,
where they can be expiated, then
to allow a man unwittingly to en
hance his private burden of guilt
and shame.
But it is hard to do. We are
fearful of being identified with
the occasional embittered prude
who lies in wait for someone to
falter in order to achieve a mo
mentary feeling of superiority.
A buddy who is high gets a
wonderful idea for a "harmless"
practical joke—one which might
accidentally lead lo serious trou
ble for him or others. What lo do?
Go along with the gag and hope
to keep it within bounds? Tell
him to go ahead, but include you
out? Both these solutions are
cowardly. Stop him? And risk
being called a wet blanket, a kill
joy, a cherry, chicken?
Obviously this requires moral j
courage, the risk of sacrifice.
Most of us will respond gener
ously to a plea for help; it is enor
mously difficult to render help to
one who is too confused, too de
fiant, too afraid to ask for it. But j
the man who can ask for help is

already on the road to victory;
the man who cannot is truly
floundering.
We have many rationalizations
for indifference towards our fel
low men. It's a free country. He's
old enough to run his own life.
It's none of my business. But
these arguments only separate us
from others, reduce opportunities
for meaningful relationships, in
tensify the feeling that essential
ly the world is a pretty cold and
hostile place.
We are all concerned that three
freshmen have attempted suicide
in less than three weeks, one suc
cessfully. There i-s little comfort
in the explanation that they were
"homesick" or "despondent over

grades." They felt alone in our
midst—alone with their fears,
and doubts, and anger, and guilt.
If people ignored each other less,
there would not be so much lone
liness.
A friend observed the following
heartening example of third per
son responsibility the other eve
ning. Two teen-agers driving
down Lmbarcadero saw a car
moving erratically in the opposite
direction, 11 a r r o w I y missing
parked cars. They turned around,
pursued the car, forced it to the
curb, politely removed the man's
keys, and called the police.
The man may now be charged
with drunk driving, but he hasn't
killed anyone, including himself.

How often have we allowed a
friend, not to mention a stranger,
to endanger himself just to escape
the effort and embarrassment of
intervening? No one wants to tell
the lady her slip is showing, or
the professor that his fly is un
zipped . . .
Third person responsibility, in
the Honor Code or elsewhere,
really means caring about the
other fellow. And what are we all

looking for in life? To find some
one to care about, and someone
who cares about us.
We marry, we have children, we
write books or symphonies, we
run for president—all in order to
matter, to be cared about, by one
person or millions, by one genera
tion or several. The world would
be much richer, much more hos
pitable and rewarding, with a bit
more Third I'erson Responsibility.
