# Rooters Integration Proposed at LASSU
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Integration of Stanford's rooting section was proposed at last
night's Legislature meeting, but action was put off until next Thurs
day to allow LASSU members to poll their constituents on the
matter.
In a humor-sprinkled discussion, the group finally decided to

find out campus opinion on the
idea of allow ing Stanford females
and males to mix freely in the
cheering section, before acting
one way or the other.
Discussion began when AWS
President Sheila Mac Donald and
Branner sponsor Lunette Smith
presented a resolution "That the
Stanford rooting section for all
football games be integrated; this
to be put into effect at the begin
ning of the 1961 football season."
.Miss Mac Donald said her pur
pose in advocating integration
was her feeling that there is no
point in a segregated rooting sec
tion and that students arc mature
enough to sit together in a root
ing section with no undue dis
turbance.
She and other members of
LASSU stressed that proposing
integration was not meant as
a sort of punishment for past
actions of the section.
Graduate School of Business
rep Bert Edwards suggested that
the answer might be to set aside
a particular area in Hie cheering
section for those students who
wished to sit with dates or wives.
11 was suggested that the mat
ter be put on the spring ASSU
election ballot for the students to
decide then.
ED CUTTER, administrative
assistant to ASSU President
Larry Royse, was against that
idea, saying that the students
might "look down" on LASSU if
the issue were pul on the ballot
by Legislature, which can do so
by a ma jority vote.
Following that, a motion was
made to amend the resolution so
that it would call for a spring
election on the question, but by
a 10-9 vote it was defeated.
The group then decided it would
be wisest to put off any action
until Thursday's meeting.

a particular area in Hie cheering
section for those students who
wished to sit with dates or wives.
11 was suggested that the mat
ter be put on the spring ASSU
election ballot for the students to
decide then.
ED CUTTER, administrative
assistant to ASSU President
Larry Royse, was against that
idea, saying that the students
might "look down" on LASSU if
the issue were pul on the ballot
by Legislature, which can do so
by a ma jority vote.
Following that, a motion was
made to amend the resolution so
that it would call for a spring
election on the question, but by
a 10-9 vote it was defeated.
The group then decided it would
be wisest to put off any action
until Thursday's meeting.
