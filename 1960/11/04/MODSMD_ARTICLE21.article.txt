# Soccer Team Travels to CCSF Tomorrow for Deciding Contest
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The Stanford soccer team faces',
City College of San Francisco to-1
morrow at 11:00 on the CCSF
field in the game that will prob- >
ably decide llie 19(50 West Coast
Soccer Conference title.
CCSF was the league championl
last year and was called by some
the best team in the nation. It.
| has six starters back from that j
team, including three all-leaguers.
'So far this year CCSF has lost 1
|only to California, in a terrific!
i upset.
This powerhouse has twice
scored 15 goals in one game, tan
| tamount to running up 80 points
in an American football game,
defeating Santa Clara 15-1, and
San Francisco State 15-0. CCSF
has never had more than one
goal scored on them in any game
this year.
CCSF figures it lias the best
team in the league, and it has
the players to back up its claim.
All-Leaguers, Yacob Dudum, Jim
Lynch, and Dave Kingsley all re
ceived Ail-American s up p or t.
Lynch's two goals singlehandedly
defeated Stanford last year, 2-1,
in a game that Stanford players
think they should have won.
Lynch and Kingsley have been
the highest-scoring twosome in
the league.
CCSF may claim to he Ihe best
team in the league, but Stanford
is in the top spot right now and
the Stanford players intend to j
' remain on top.
Stanford coach Fred Priddle has
1 readied his attack all week for a
i high-scoring game, and has tooled
the offense to take advantage of
the talents of Emmanuel Andah
and others on the front line.
Andah has been the top scorer
! to date, but the bread and butter
of the Stanford offense has been 1
the passing of Bernie Knaggs and 1
Rune Engebrettsen and the clutch

scoring of Mike Tippett, Dick
Bartlett and Adam Bianchi.
Stanford's defense has been the
tightest in the league, allowing
opponents only 29 shots and six
goals in the five games played so
far this year. Usually, a team,
even a bad one, will gft 15 to 20
shots a game, but Stanford has
been holding opponents' shooting
down to six attempts a game and
only one goal.
This adds up to the fact that
the fine work done by fullbacks
Dan Farthing and Dick Voake,
and halfbacks Knaggs, Jan Achen
bach, and Rusty Williams has pre
vented rookie goalie Beau Bianchi
from doing much work.
Bianchi will certainly have his
work cut out for him Saturday,
partly because of CCSF's fine
offense, but mainly because Ach
enbach, perhaps the most vital
cog in Stanford's defense, is ail
ing with an ankle injury. Allison
Gibbs will take over Achenbach's
starting position.
Coach Priddle said that Achen
bach could play if he was needed.
A player of All-Amcrican caliber
is always needed.

San Francisco State 15-0. CCSF
has never had more than one
goal scored on them in any game
this year.
CCSF figures it lias the best
team in the league, and it has
the players to back up its claim.
All-Leaguers, Yacob Dudum, Jim
Lynch, and Dave Kingsley all re
ceived Ail-American s up p or t.
Lynch's two goals singlehandedly
defeated Stanford last year, 2-1,
in a game that Stanford players
think they should have won.
Lynch and Kingsley have been
the highest-scoring twosome in
the league.
CCSF may claim to he Ihe best
team in the league, but Stanford
is in the top spot right now and
the Stanford players intend to j
' remain on top.
Stanford coach Fred Priddle has
1 readied his attack all week for a
i high-scoring game, and has tooled
the offense to take advantage of
the talents of Emmanuel Andah
and others on the front line.
Andah has been the top scorer
! to date, but the bread and butter
of the Stanford offense has been 1
the passing of Bernie Knaggs and 1
Rune Engebrettsen and the clutch

scoring of Mike Tippett, Dick
Bartlett and Adam Bianchi.
Stanford's defense has been the
tightest in the league, allowing
opponents only 29 shots and six
goals in the five games played so
far this year. Usually, a team,
even a bad one, will gft 15 to 20
shots a game, but Stanford has
been holding opponents' shooting
down to six attempts a game and
only one goal.
This adds up to the fact that
the fine work done by fullbacks
Dan Farthing and Dick Voake,
and halfbacks Knaggs, Jan Achen
bach, and Rusty Williams has pre
vented rookie goalie Beau Bianchi
from doing much work.
Bianchi will certainly have his
work cut out for him Saturday,
partly because of CCSF's fine
offense, but mainly because Ach
enbach, perhaps the most vital
cog in Stanford's defense, is ail
ing with an ankle injury. Allison
Gibbs will take over Achenbach's
starting position.
Coach Priddle said that Achen
bach could play if he was needed.
A player of All-Amcrican caliber
is always needed.
