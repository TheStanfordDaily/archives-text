# HARRIERS HOPE FOR AN UPSET
## Card Runners Face Cal, UCLA 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
TOMORROW morning Stan
ford's upset-minded harriers will
venture forth from the friendly
confines of the Farm to try to
outrun the highly touted cross
country men of Cal and UCLA.
Both teams which will oppose
the Indian distance men in the
triangular meet on the Berkeley
campus have beaten the Cards in
recent weeks. Last Saturday the
Bear runners edged Stanford 26
to 30, and the week before UCLA
won out on a 2;"5 to 30 count.
Neither of these defeats was
anywhere n e a r overwhelming,
however, and ihe way the Stan
ford runners have been improv
ing, they should have an excel
lent chance of reversing the count.
LEADING the Cards will be
junior Rich Klier, who according
to Coach Pay ton Jordan, is fast
developing into the best middle
distance runner in Stanford his
tory.
Right behind are three of the
best frosh in years, Bill Pratt,
Robin Ruble, and Dave Eoore.
John Northway rounds out the
top five.
Pratt turned in a tremendous
race last week, running more on
desire than anything else. This is
the sort of thing which is char
acteristic of this team, and it is
team effort which will have to
make the difference if they are
to win.
CAL'S SQUAD, headed by Alan
Gaylord, Woody Covington, and
George Linn, has more and
brighter individual stars than the
Indian s. But the Bears have
trouble placing five men close
together, and this could be their
downfall.
UCLA's team resembles Stan
ford's more closely; fewer big
stars, but a more balanced and
coordinated team. Milford Dahl,

third best miler at tho NCAA
championships, and Walt Maxwell
are the men to watch.
SPIRIT is high this week
among the harriers. Just two days
ago the entire Card track team
participated in the "Stanford Fall
Intrasquad Handicap Cross Coun
try Championships." This was
part of Coach Jordan's new train
ing program which includes cross
country running for everyone, in
cluding shot putters and discus
throwers.
The winning team which cap
tured the coveted "Stinky Seven"
trophy included Klier, Jim Davis,
Hugh Smith, Harry Wyeth, Dave

Weill, Art Batchelder, and Chris
Stack. The last three named are
not runners at all, hut weight
men.
Jordan was quite pleased with
the fine condition of the whole
track and field squad, and the
way thiit they have worked to I
get in shape.
Just consider the case, for ex
ample, of discus thrower Dave
Weill, who weighs about 280
pounds. Weill lumbered along for j
two miles in 13 minutes 42 sec
onds. Not a spectacular time for
a runner, but a lot better than
the vast majority of Indians could
do carrying .just half that weight.
