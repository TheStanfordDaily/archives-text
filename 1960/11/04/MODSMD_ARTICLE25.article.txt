(Editor's note: The following 1 is
the second in the series of reports
on the loosely organized Stanford
Cricket Club. Readers are again
cautioned <o take account of Mr.
Howe's unorthodox style.)

Stanford won the toss and elee
lert to bat. Ghista and McCorney
weathered the opening attack
with much artistry and put the
innings on a firm foundation.
Then Adarkar and Beckford, both

batting fluently, added 40 for the
third wicket.
It was feared that G. G. Ball
would not play: several communi
cations were sent him at his hon
eymoon cottage. No replies were
1 received. Oddly enough, he turned
3 out, and by agilely blocking the
j fielders from his fly balls,
amassed the highest score of his
j career. As a final gesture of de-
I fiance to the Cal bowlers, Milton
1 cracked Birch for a bellicose 6

before the innings was over for
88.
MILTON 1 and McCorney howled
aggressively and each got a
couple of wickets. The Cal score
mounted ominously to 67, with
four men to bat. Birch flayed the
first two balls from Adaker for
a six and a four, only to be beaten
by the flight of the third ball.
Next ball another wicket fell:
then Adarkar's flight removed
Delaney. At this critical point,
Cal C.C., in their decadence, at-;
tempted to subvert the spirit of
cricket by playing a female in
their batting order.
Howe, the Stanford skipper, re
fused to permit such a bowdleri
zation, and the game to degen-j
erate into maudlin bathos. Paul,'
of Stanford, was opted to Cal j
C.C. as last man and conscien
tiously popped up the last ball
for an easy catch.
CAE were all out for 78,
and tho name of Stanford cricket j
revivified.

(Editor's note: The following 1 is
the second in the series of reports
on the loosely organized Stanford
Cricket Club. Readers are again
cautioned <o take account of Mr.
Howe's unorthodox style.)

Stanford won the toss and elee
lert to bat. Ghista and McCorney
weathered the opening attack
with much artistry and put the
innings on a firm foundation.
Then Adarkar and Beckford, both

batting fluently, added 40 for the
third wicket.
It was feared that G. G. Ball
would not play: several communi
cations were sent him at his hon
eymoon cottage. No replies were
1 received. Oddly enough, he turned
3 out, and by agilely blocking the
j fielders from his fly balls,
amassed the highest score of his
j career. As a final gesture of de-
I fiance to the Cal bowlers, Milton
1 cracked Birch for a bellicose 6

before the innings was over for
88.
MILTON 1 and McCorney howled
aggressively and each got a
couple of wickets. The Cal score
mounted ominously to 67, with
four men to bat. Birch flayed the
first two balls from Adaker for
a six and a four, only to be beaten
by the flight of the third ball.
Next ball another wicket fell:
then Adarkar's flight removed
Delaney. At this critical point,
Cal C.C., in their decadence, at-;
tempted to subvert the spirit of
cricket by playing a female in
their batting order.
Howe, the Stanford skipper, re
fused to permit such a bowdleri
zation, and the game to degen-j
erate into maudlin bathos. Paul,'
of Stanford, was opted to Cal j
C.C. as last man and conscien
tiously popped up the last ball
for an easy catch.
CAE were all out for 78,
and tho name of Stanford cricket j
revivified.
