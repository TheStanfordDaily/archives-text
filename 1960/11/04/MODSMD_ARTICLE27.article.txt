# Water Poloists Host UCLA Today
## 
### 
STANFORD'S water polo squad
j enters the next to last week of its
campaign with a good chance to
win and a good chance to lose as
the Cards meet the UCLA Bruins
today at 3:30 in the varsity pool
and the San Jose State Spartans
| tomorrow morning at 10:00 here.
I In their last meeting with the
i Uclans, Stanford lost in overtime
play, 7-9, in a not too well played
cont e s t. under I lie Southland
smog.
Meanwhile, the Indians have
been steadily improving week by
I week and almost topped the pow
i erful USC Trojans last week, how-
I ing out by only one goal.
THE INDIANS should be up
! for this contest as it probably is
their last chance for a win this
season.
Tomorrow Stanford tangles
with tough San Jose State, who
! throttled the Indians 17-6 last time
! around.
Probably San Jose coach Art
Lambert's top star is Lon Chris
| Hansen. But in the event the In
dians bottle Christiansen, the
I Spartans can call on the likes of
I Roger Scaife, who threw in four
I goals against the Tribe in their
j last meeting.
ALL Til 10 Indian water polo
ists are hale and hearty for ihe
weekend frays. Bob Lorton and
Bob Spenee, the most consistent
Card scorers, are expected to do

most of the damage to Ihe enemy
goals, but Roger Johnson, who
came up with three big seores |
against the Trojans last week,
should provide a third big threat, i
Rich Rosenberger, Mike Conn, ;
Jack Lor ton and goalie John
Bates round out the Stanford
starting seven, but Grant Gisko,
Paul Hait, Mike Strauss and
Tommy Wong are ready to step
in at any time.
Til 10 F R C) S II aqua poloists
should have a relatively easy j
time this weekend as they meet ]
up with Carlmont High School j
today right after the varsity con
test and with the San Jose frosh
tomorrow morning here at 11:00.

For tho frosh Rill Lorton, Polo
Petti grow, Jim Youd, Don Bueh
lor, Boh Farrell, Dave Fielding,
and Doug Zwissler will compose
