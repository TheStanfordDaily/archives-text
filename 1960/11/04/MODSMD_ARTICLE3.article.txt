on recommended use of American
troops in Indo-China, and ended
his 1958 Latin American good will

"proved" incorrect on the state of
U.S. prestige abroad, on efforts to
get Nationalist China to . with

Kennedy said the people "will
not forget" the Vice President's
failure to foresee crises "for they
know that experience counts."

and I stand in succession to
Franklin Roosevelt and John Gar
ner, and we're going to win this
election."
