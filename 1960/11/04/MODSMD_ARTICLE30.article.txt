THE PARTY WEEKEND: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE
\\ ith the season of party weekends almost upon us, my mail of
late has been flooded with queries from young inmates of women's
colleges wishing to know how one conducts one's self when one
has invited a young gentleman for u weekend, so let us today
take up this burning issue.
Well, my dear girls, the first thing to remember is that your
young gentleman is far from home and frightened. Put him at
his ease. You might, for instance, surprise him by having hi>
mother sitting in a rocker on the station platform when be gets
off the train.
.Next, what kind of corsage should you send your young gentle
man? Well, my beloved maidens, orchids are always acceptable.
So, indeed, are phlox and delphinium. In fact, most any flora
will serve. Do try, however, to avoid carnivorous plants.
If you find, my esteemed fillies, that your local florist has run
out of stock, do not be dismayed. Make a corsage out of paper.
Hut pick good, stiff, durable paper—twenty dollar bills, for
example.
Remember at all times, my fond wenches, to show your young
gentleman courtesy and consideration. Open doors for him,
walk on the traffic side of the path, assist him to the punch bowl,
zip his parka, light his Marlboros. (What, you ask. if he doesn't
smoke Marlboros? Ridiculous, my precious nymphs! Of course,
lie smokes Marlboros! Don't you? Don't I? Doesn't everybody
who knows a hawk front a handsaw? What other cigarette
gives you such a lot to like? Such easy-drawing filtration? Such
unfiltered taste? Such soft pack or flip-top box? No other, my
sweet minxes, no other. Marlboro stands alone, and any man
wort hy of you, my estimable damsels, is bound to be a Marlboro
man.)

If you will follow the simple instructions stated above, my
good lasses, you will find that you have turned your young
gentleman into a fast and fervent admirer. There is nothing
quite like a party weekend to promote romance. I am in mind
of a party weekend some years ago at Miss Pomfritt's Seminary
for well-born females in West Linotype, Ohio. Serafina Sigafoos,
a sophomore at this institution, majoring in napkin folding, sent
an invitation to a young man named Fafnir Valve, a junior at
the Joyce Kilmer School of Forestry, majoring in sap and boles.
Serafina had been ape for Fafnir since high school, but Fafnir
preferred a named Clelia Fleshwound, the high school drum
majorette who once threw a baton so high she impaled a south
bound mallard.
Anyhow, Serafina sent an invitation to Fafnir, and he came,
and she showered him with kindness and cuff links, and then
1 it! went away, and Serafina sat anxiously by the mailbox,
wondering whether she would ever hear from him again. Sure
enough, two weeks later she got a letter: "Dear Serafina, Can
you let me have fifty bucks? Yours, Fafnir."
Whimpering with ecstasy, she ran to the bank and withdrew
the money and mailed it to him. From then on, she got the
same request every week, and as a result, she became very well
acquainted with Ralph T. Involute, teller of the West Linotype
Hank and Trust Co., and their friendship ripened into love, and
today they are happily married and live in Stamen, Oregon,
where Ralph is in the extruded molasses game and Serafina
IS a hjdrant. (jj> tyui Mm .Shtilman
