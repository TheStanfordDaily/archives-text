# UC Scientists Receive Nobels

### 
STOCKHOLM (UPH The
1960 Nobel Prizes for chemistry
and physics were awarded yester
day to two University of Cali
fornia professors for their in
ventions of a so-called "atomic
time clock'' to determine age and
a "bubble chamber" to photo
j graph the atom.
Till] CHEMISTRY prize went
| to Prof. Donald A. Glaser, 34. of
the University's Berkeley branch
who started his "bubble chamber"
research with $5 worth of equip
ment and six bottles of beer and
j went on to perfect a device to
■ make it possible to photograph
the act of atom smashing and
learn more about the atom nuclei.
He is one of the youngest persons
ever to win the award.
The physics prize was won by
Prof. Wiilard Libby, 51, of the
University's Los Angeles branch
for his atomic time clock which
uses radiocarbon, or carbon-14, to
determine the age of such items
as an Egyptian mummy, the Dead
Sea scrolls, a 1,000-year-old lotus
seed and a Cedar of Lebanon.
KA( II MAN will receive an
award of $13,625 when King (ins
tat Adolf of Sweden presents the
; Nobel Prizes at a ceremony Dec.
10. It was the first time in the
60-year-old history of the Nobel
Prizes that two scientists from
the same university won two
prizes outright.
Friends at the University of
Michigan said Glaser became in
terested in the "bubble chamber"
in 1 when he discovered that
beer foams when it is opened. He
decided the foam was caused by
the beer being struck by a parti
cle of mater from the atmosphere.
MIiKY'S USK of carbon-14 in
his atomic time clock came from
his research into the radioactive
products formed by cosmic rays
I in the atmosphere. Carbon I I and
. Tritium are iwo such particles.
