# Indians Seek First Win In Tilt With Oregon Ducks
## Daily Sports 
### RUSS ALLEN 
Tomorrow the Stanford Indians will again go after their first
win of the waning 1960 football season. Though rated 14'■a-point un
derdogs, tomorrow's contest with the Oregon VVebfeet could prove
the one that jells the Tribe and they may come home with that
initial big win.
A key factor in tomorrow's tilt is that always dismal Oregon

weather. For if the field is wet or
muddy but the day is relatively
free from rain the Indian passing
attack could click and the vaunted
Oregon running game will bog
down.

(Edtor's note: Stanford Daily
sportswriter Russ Allen is jour
neying North to Portland with
the team. His complete account
of this Saturday's game with Ore
yon will he in Monday's Daily.
The game will he broadcast at
on KCKS.)

No otic doubts thai Oregon has 1
a much faster team than Stan
ford's and they have an equally !
strong running and passing at-'
lack. But certainly Card gridders
will be greatly aided if the fasl I
Duck backs Cleveland Jones and
Dave Grayson two San Diego
boys can't turn the corners,
around end because of the slip- ,
pery turf.
( IOHTAINLV if the Card line
plays that same aggressive ball
that the USC Trojans saw here
last Saturday the Ducks will be
stopped cold.
The big question in the minds
of most Northwest fans is
whether Duck Coach Len Casa
nova can bring his team up for
the Indians after last Saturday's
letdown loss to Washington, 7-U, ,

in the closing minutes of the
game.
However, because the Ducks
have an outside chance for a post
season bowl bid with their 5-2
record they will certainly be out
to increase their win side. They
know they can't afford to lose to
the Indians and therefore will be
plenty tough.
IN THE Stanford camp that old
problem of lack of depth in the
guard spot is again plaguing t ho
team. Ron Fernandes is •still
bothered by his ankle and Errol
Scott who suffered a dislocated
shoulder in the SC game—rein
jnred it slightly in drills but both
men should see limited action to
morrow.
Junior Tom Walsh who is
making his first start for Stan
ford in front of a home-town
crowd in Portland will mov£ into
the starling roll at right guard.
Sophomore Steve Player was
moved up into Walsh's second
team spot and Don Peter will play
the other guard position.
Stanford's tackles probably
the best group in four or five
years will all be in good shape
for tomorrow's tilt. Co-captain
Dean Hinshaw, C. B. Simons, Jack
Gordon and Phil Toorvald will be
oul to stop Oregon's favorite off
tackle plays.

Portlander Will Start Before Hometown Crowd
center for the Indians with John
But lor moving in on defense at a
line-backer spot.
In the backfield co-captain Dick
Norman will be signal-calling for
the Tribe and will hope for clear
skies so that he can get the Tribe
passing attack going. Also Dick
will try to pass John Brodie by
as Stanford's all-time passing
quarterback.
The Tribe senior needs only 149
yards to go inio the lead in the

all-time Stanford individual pass
ing yardage stats.
Mac Wylie and Skip Face will
be two boys who will try to aid
Dick in his efforts on the receiv
ing end of the game. Wylie has de
veloped as the top Tribe receiver
from his flanker back position.
Mac has caught twenty passes
for 303 yards so far this season.
AS WKLL as receiving passes,
Face will carry a good share of
Stanford's rushing game with
halfback Gil Dowd. The Card
fullback is the ihird best ground
gainer in the AAWU so far this
year and teammate Dowd is right
behind him in this department.
Ends Steve Pursell and Dale
Ostrander will also aid the In
dian parsing attack as well as try
to keep the Oregon wide game
corraled.
The Indians face a well-balanced
Oregon team which specializes on
speed and deception on offense
as well as aggressiveness and
speed in pursuit on defense.
The Duck backfield consists of
an experienced, versatile and top
rate quarterback Dave Grosz;

speedy halfbacks Dave Grayson
and Cleveland Jones; and fullback
Bruce Snyder.
IX THIS line Dave Urell and
Mike Rose although a doubtful
starter with an injured neck—
should be very tough at guard.
Steve Barnett and Riley Mattson
mav get the nods for starting

berths at tackles. Center should
be Joe Clesceri and ends will be
Len Burnett and Greg Willener.
Though lacking in experience
Ihe Oregon line is fast and has
held the tough Huskies to only
one touchdown, so tomorrow's
game will be a tough one for the
Indians.
