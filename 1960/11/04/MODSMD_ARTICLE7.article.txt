# Indians Seek First Win In Tilt With Oregon Ducks
## Daily Sports 
### RUSS ALLEN 
Tomorrow the Stanford Indians will again go after their first
win of the waning 1960 football season. Though rated 14'■a-point un
derdogs, tomorrow's contest with the Oregon VVebfeet could prove
the one that jells the Tribe and they may come home with that
initial big win.
A key factor in tomorrow's tilt is that always dismal Oregon

weather. For if the field is wet or
muddy but the day is relatively
free from rain the Indian passing
attack could click and the vaunted
Oregon running game will bog
down.

(Edtor's note: Stanford Daily
sportswriter Russ Allen is jour
neying North to Portland with
the team. His complete account
of this Saturday's game with Ore
yon will he in Monday's Daily.
The game will he broadcast at
on KCKS.)

No otic doubts thai Oregon has 1
a much faster team than Stan
ford's and they have an equally !
strong running and passing at-'
lack. But certainly Card gridders
will be greatly aided if the fasl I
Duck backs Cleveland Jones and
Dave Grayson two San Diego
boys can't turn the corners,
around end because of the slip- ,
pery turf.
( IOHTAINLV if the Card line
plays that same aggressive ball
that the USC Trojans saw here
last Saturday the Ducks will be
stopped cold.
The big question in the minds
of most Northwest fans is
whether Duck Coach Len Casa
nova can bring his team up for
the Indians after last Saturday's
letdown loss to Washington, 7-U, ,

in the closing minutes of the
game.
However, because the Ducks
have an outside chance for a post
season bowl bid with their 5-2
record they will certainly be out
to increase their win side. They
know they can't afford to lose to
the Indians and therefore will be
plenty tough.
IN THE Stanford camp that old
problem of lack of depth in the
guard spot is again plaguing t ho
team. Ron Fernandes is •still
bothered by his ankle and Errol
Scott who suffered a dislocated
shoulder in the SC game—rein
jnred it slightly in drills but both
men should see limited action to
morrow.
Junior Tom Walsh who is
making his first start for Stan
ford in front of a home-town
crowd in Portland will mov£ into
the starling roll at right guard.
Sophomore Steve Player was
moved up into Walsh's second
team spot and Don Peter will play
the other guard position.
Stanford's tackles probably
the best group in four or five
years will all be in good shape
for tomorrow's tilt. Co-captain
Dean Hinshaw, C. B. Simons, Jack
Gordon and Phil Toorvald will be
oul to stop Oregon's favorite off
tackle plays.
