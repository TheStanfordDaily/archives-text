TORT
Pride of the law school, I
Blackstone has never lost a
moot trial. But there's noth
ing moot about his prefer
ences in dress. He finds that I
when he's comfortable, he
can trap a witness and sway
a jury like Clarence Darrow.
So he always wears Jockcy
brand briefs while preparing I
his briefs. Exclusive Jockey
tailoring gives him a bonus
of comfort he gets in no other I
underwear. Fine Jockey I
combed cotton is more ab
sorbent, smoother fitting, too.
To look your best, feel your I
best, take a tip from Tort. S
Always insist on Jockey m
brand briefs, $1.25. Your hi
campus store has them now! m
