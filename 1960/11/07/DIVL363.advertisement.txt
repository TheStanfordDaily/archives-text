These are the silver wings of a
U. S. Air Force Navigator. As a
fly ing officer on the Aerospace
team, he has chosen a career of
leadership, a career that has
meaning, rewards and executive
opportunity.
The Aviation Cadet Program
is the gateway to this career. To
qualify for this rigorous and pro
fessional training, a high school
diploma is required ; however, two
or more years of college are highly
desirable. Upon completion of the
program the Air Force encourages
the new officer to earn his degree
so he can better handle the respon
sibilities of his position. This in
cludes full pay and allowances
while taking off-duty courses un
der the Bootstrap education pro
gram. The Air Force will pay a
substantial part of all tuition costs.
After having attained enough
credits so that lie can complete
coifrse work and residence require
ments for a college degree in 6
months or less, he is eligible to
apply for temporary duty at the
school of his choice.

takes to earn the silver wings of
