flne crushing
pressure of
2,000,000 psi
At the General Motors Research Laboratories the 600-ton tetrahedral anvil press
duplicates pressures which exist 200 miles beneath the earth's surface. The pur
pose: to study the combined effect of ultra-high pressure and temperature on
the physical and chemical properties of known materials with an eye toward
improving their properties or even creating new materials.
What happens to solids at pressures of 2,000,000 psi and 7,000 degrees
F.? General Motors has the research facilities required to answer these
questions. In addition, GM offers experience and diversification to pro
vide the young scientist and engineer with unlimited opportunity.
Automotive research, production engineering and manufacturing, elec
tronics and astronautics are just a few of the many technical areas
offered. You will be given every opportunity to concentrate on one, or
if your interests are varied you may move into other divisions. You'll
be in a position to tackle big jobs at GM because this is where important
things are being done. It's the opportunity of a lifetime and it offers a
lifetime of opportunity.
General Motors also has a program which provides financial aid for
postgraduate and undergraduate studies. For more complete informa
tion check with your college Placement Officer, or write to General
Motors Salaried Personnel Staff, Detroit 2, Michigan.
