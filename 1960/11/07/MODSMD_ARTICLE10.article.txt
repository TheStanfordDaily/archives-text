# Stanford Professors Predict Election Results

### KATHEE DOWNING 
Predicting the winner of tomor
row's presidential election is risky
business, according to some prom
inent Stanford political science
professors. Dr. Robert A. Walker,
head of the political science de
partment, ventured that "as the
campaign has developed so far,
I feel that Kennedy will win."
While Kennedy apparently is
the favorite for many, predictions
are usually colored with "ifs and i
buts." Dr. Heinz Eulau predicted
a Kennedy victory "only if he car
ries the major metropolitan cen
ters and the South."
"Electoral college votes for Ken
nedy," said Eulau, "could be as
many as 406."
IN THE race for state votes,

both Walker and Eulau felt Texas
would bo difficult for Kennedy to
hold. Eulau predicted that Flor
ida and some of the South could
be lost to Nixon; however, Ken
nedy could pick up the farm states
vote. Walker predicted a "solid
sweep for Kennedy."
Dr. Gra h a m Stuart, retired
Stanford professor of political
science, argued that "never before
in the history of this nation has
an election outcome been so diffi
cult to predict." One of the "hid
den factors" he mentioned was
that the key states New York,
California and Ohio - are still
question marks. Stuart also
claimed that no one knows what
the religious issue will do in the
election.
Associate Professor Martin B.
Travis also felt the election would
be difficult to predict "as many
are uncommitted because of the
religious problem." Though Tra
vis said "those who arc pro-Nixon
are gloomy," he would offer no
prediction.
••IT WILL be terribly close,"
agreed Dr. Kurt Steiner, Stanford
political science professor. A poll
of the Stanford Mens' Faculty
Association showed that half of
them would personally vote for
Nixon, but that two-third felt Ken
nedy would sweep the nation.
"K enn e d y has a personal
attractiveness not shared by his
opponent," said Walker. "His sin
cerity is coming through." Walker
agreed with Eulau that the Peace
Corps Kennedy proposes has ex
cellent possibilities.
WALKER said that the plan is
"completely consistent with the
four-point program under Tru
man which has not been fully
developed since Trumans' term.
Also, Walker felt Kennedy's posi
tive program for old age and med
ical care has "caught the Republi
cans at a disadvantage."
However, Stuart noted that "if
the promises of the Democratic
platform are kept, we may have
a serious inflation. The platform
is quite socialistic . . . and has
gone the whole way 1o {jive labor
anything it asks for," Stuart con
tinued.
Though many elements could
still sway the election, Walker
contends thai Kennedy is ahead
because "people like him."

many as 406."
IN THE race for state votes,

both Walker and Eulau felt Texas
would bo difficult for Kennedy to
hold. Eulau predicted that Flor
ida and some of the South could
be lost to Nixon; however, Ken
nedy could pick up the farm states
vote. Walker predicted a "solid
sweep for Kennedy."
Dr. Gra h a m Stuart, retired
Stanford professor of political
science, argued that "never before
in the history of this nation has
an election outcome been so diffi
cult to predict." One of the "hid
den factors" he mentioned was
that the key states New York,
California and Ohio - are still
question marks. Stuart also
claimed that no one knows what
the religious issue will do in the
election.
Associate Professor Martin B.
Travis also felt the election would
be difficult to predict "as many
are uncommitted because of the
religious problem." Though Tra
vis said "those who arc pro-Nixon
are gloomy," he would offer no
prediction.
••IT WILL be terribly close,"
agreed Dr. Kurt Steiner, Stanford
political science professor. A poll
of the Stanford Mens' Faculty
Association showed that half of
them would personally vote for
Nixon, but that two-third felt Ken
nedy would sweep the nation.
"K enn e d y has a personal
attractiveness not shared by his
opponent," said Walker. "His sin
cerity is coming through." Walker
agreed with Eulau that the Peace
Corps Kennedy proposes has ex
cellent possibilities.
WALKER said that the plan is
"completely consistent with the
four-point program under Tru
man which has not been fully
developed since Trumans' term.
Also, Walker felt Kennedy's posi
tive program for old age and med
ical care has "caught the Republi
cans at a disadvantage."
However, Stuart noted that "if
the promises of the Democratic
platform are kept, we may have
a serious inflation. The platform
is quite socialistic . . . and has
gone the whole way 1o {jive labor
anything it asks for," Stuart con
tinued.
Though many elements could
still sway the election, Walker
contends thai Kennedy is ahead
because "people like him."
Predicting the winner of tomor
row's presidential election is risky
business, according to some prom
inent Stanford political science
professors. Dr. Robert A. Walker,
head of the political science de
partment, ventured that "as the
campaign has developed so far,
I feel that Kennedy will win."
While Kennedy apparently is
the favorite for many, predictions
are usually colored with "ifs and i
buts." Dr. Heinz Eulau predicted
a Kennedy victory "only if he car
ries the major metropolitan cen
ters and the South."
"Electoral college votes for Ken
nedy," said Eulau, "could be as
many as 406."
