# An Important Proposal
## 
### 
Senator Kennedy's proposal last. Wednesday night to create a
"Peace Corps" of young men and women to serve in underdevel
oped countries for three years as an "alternative" to entering mili
tary service under the draft is perhaps the most important idea
to emerge from the candidates" campaigns.
Kennedy claimed that the United States under the Republicans
had been "ill-staffed and ill-represented in the struggle for peace"
in the fields of disarmament, planning diplomatic and foreign
service and technical aid to underdeveloped nations. He is right,
onlv the Republicans are not completely at fault.
The United States has been unprepared to fight the Communists
in the underdeveloped areas of the world since the Communists
have been in power, which, of course, includes the Roosevelt and
Truman administrations.
Kennedy's proposal, however, should be examined above petty
partisan squabbles. A Republican Congressional candidate, Heinz
Rollman, claims that the creation of a '"Peace Corps" is his idea
and is in his book, "World Construction." Kennedy has never
claimed that the proposal is original! As a matter of fact, there
have been many books written in recent years calling for similar
proposals. The famous best-seller, "The Ugly American," is con
cerned with the problem.
The important point to realize is that Senator Kennedy is the
only presidential candidate who lias considered the matter so vital
as to make a proposal.
The need for such a corps of highly trained, intelligent Ameri
cans is unquestionable. The Communists have a mammoth,
smoothly functioning propaganda machine which makes our few
attempts to explain our side look very feeble and impotent in
comparison.
If this proposal becomes reality it will have far-reaching effects
in this country. It will change the military picture considerably,
a picture which needs some changing anyway. Too many intelli
gent young men are now wasting their time running around with
guns, knives and bombs. As members of the Peace Corps, they
could render our country a much greater service by countering
Communist lies with the truth, and by giving the underdeveloped
countries our side of the story.
As we have said before, the battle between Communism and
Democracy will not be decided by bombs and missiles, but by
which camp can convince the most people that it is the one to join.
It is in this area, in the area of men's beliefs, that this Peace Corps
can render this country a most valuable service.
If Mr. Kennedy wins tomorrow, we hope that he acts upon his
proposal as soon as possible and that it is not lost among other
campaign proposals which will be forgotten. If Mr. Nixon wins,
we hope he sees the significance of this Corps and acts accordingly.
