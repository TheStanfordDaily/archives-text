May I strongly second Profes
sor Wilfred Stone's letter in the
Nov. 3rd Daily? Project Africa
appears to be one of our most
vigorous and significant student
activities which has been initiat
ed at Stanford in recent years.
The efforts of the African desk
to acquaint the student body with
the contemporary political situa
tion, as well as the attempt to
establish further student ex
changes between Africa and
America, very much deserve our
respect.
In contrast to the vapidity of
Rally Com and similar organiza
tions, activities such as Project
Africa, the student NAACP and
the Mental Health Field Work
Project need and deserve active
student support.

The realists' reply: the forward
ness and vigor of this nation are
truly endangered by such poppy
cock as stated in the letter by
Mr. Clark D. Neher. A pre-stated
stop-by-step, unilateral disarma
ment policy, and gradual aban
donment of our overseas bases
would lead us to the position in
which we would have no choice
between offensive and defensive
war. We could only fight a de
fensive war.
I feel an imperative need to
predict the realistic situation
which would therefore evolve.
Defense could only be on an indi
vidualized basis. So we would
have to have an individualized
weapon. This would be the weap
on that Mr. Neher would prob
ably propose:
Ammonium hydroxide and io
dine crystals mixed; iodine crys
tals then mixed with water; then
crystals clumped out to dry. When
they are dry they will automati
cally explode when stepped upon.
And thus the Russians would
perish in a wall of explosions as
they stepped upon our fair and
bountiful land.

Editor, the Daily:
Few of us would agree that it
is the role of government to feed
us, house us, and guarantee us a
secure old age. And yet, the
Democratic Party through its viva
cious presidential candidate tells
us that we have a "RIGHT to a
job, a RIGHT to adequate hous
ing, and a RIGHT to a secure old
age" and that they will see that
the government supplies us with
these things.
I submit that ALL of us have
the right to SEEK employment,
to WORK FOR adequate housing,
and to WORK FOR a secure old
age and that it is the role of gov
ernment to secure for us THESE
rights.
By omitting the words "seek"
and "work for," the Democratic
party has appealed to the basic
insecurity of an unenlightened
populace and with its welfare
statism would restrict our liberty
and supplant our initiative with
an omnipotent bureaucracy. It Ls
time to wake up before the col
lectivists succeed further in sub
ordinating the individual to the
state.

Editor, the Daily:
It is not surprising that gradu
ate students are said to be apa
thetic. In years past, less than
three per cent of the total possi
ble vote within the School of En
gineering has elected a repre
sentative to the ASSU legislative
body.
Yet I know that graduate stu
dents are critical towards many
facets of Stanford life, including
the actions of their student gov
ernment. In fairness, the gradu
ate students do care—in truth,
they don't care enough.
Wednesday and Thursday we
havea chance to choose one repre
sentative from School of Engi
neering and two from the com
bined schools of Mineral Sciences,
Humanities, and Sciences. I hope
i Ihat every graduate student who
11 is eligible to vote will care enough

The realists' reply: the forward
ness and vigor of this nation are
truly endangered by such poppy
cock as stated in the letter by
Mr. Clark D. Neher. A pre-stated
stop-by-step, unilateral disarma
ment policy, and gradual aban
donment of our overseas bases
would lead us to the position in
which we would have no choice
between offensive and defensive
war. We could only fight a de
fensive war.
I feel an imperative need to
predict the realistic situation
which would therefore evolve.
Defense could only be on an indi
vidualized basis. So we would
have to have an individualized
weapon. This would be the weap
on that Mr. Neher would prob
ably propose:
Ammonium hydroxide and io
dine crystals mixed; iodine crys
tals then mixed with water; then
crystals clumped out to dry. When
they are dry they will automati
cally explode when stepped upon.
And thus the Russians would
perish in a wall of explosions as
they stepped upon our fair and
bountiful land.

I submit that ALL of us have
the right to SEEK employment,
to WORK FOR adequate housing,
and to WORK FOR a secure old
age and that it is the role of gov

rights.
By omitting the words "seek"

insecurity of an unenlightened

Yet I know that graduate stu

truly endangered by such poppy
cock as stated in the letter by
Mr. Clark D. Neher. A pre-stated
stop-by-step, unilateral disarma
ment policy, and gradual aban
donment of our overseas bases
would lead us to the position in
which we would have no choice
between offensive and defensive
war. We could only fight a de
fensive war.
I feel an imperative need to
predict the realistic situation
which would therefore evolve.
Defense could only be on an indi
vidualized basis. So we would
have to have an individualized
weapon. This would be the weap
on that Mr. Neher would prob
ably propose:
Ammonium hydroxide and io
dine crystals mixed; iodine crys
tals then mixed with water; then
crystals clumped out to dry. When
they are dry they will automati
cally explode when stepped upon.
And thus the Russians would
perish in a wall of explosions as
they stepped upon our fair and
bountiful land.

Few of us would agree that it
is the role of government to feed
us, house us, and guarantee us a
secure old age. And yet, the
Democratic Party through its viva
cious presidential candidate tells
us that we have a "RIGHT to a
job, a RIGHT to adequate hous
ing, and a RIGHT to a secure old
age" and that they will see that
the government supplies us with
these things.
I submit that ALL of us have
the right to SEEK employment,
to WORK FOR adequate housing,
and to WORK FOR a secure old
age and that it is the role of gov
ernment to secure for us THESE
rights.
By omitting the words "seek"
and "work for," the Democratic
party has appealed to the basic
insecurity of an unenlightened
populace and with its welfare
statism would restrict our liberty
and supplant our initiative with
an omnipotent bureaucracy. It Ls
time to wake up before the col
lectivists succeed further in sub
ordinating the individual to the
state.

Editor, the Daily:
It is not surprising that gradu
ate students are said to be apa
thetic. In years past, less than
three per cent of the total possi
ble vote within the School of En
gineering has elected a repre
sentative to the ASSU legislative
body.
Yet I know that graduate stu
dents are critical towards many
facets of Stanford life, including
the actions of their student gov
ernment. In fairness, the gradu
ate students do care—in truth,
they don't care enough.
Wednesday and Thursday we
havea chance to choose one repre
sentative from School of Engi
neering and two from the com
bined schools of Mineral Sciences,
Humanities, and Sciences. I hope
i Ihat every graduate student who
11 is eligible to vote will care enough
(this time.
