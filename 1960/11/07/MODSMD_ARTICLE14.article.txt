# U.S. African Policy

### PETER DUIGNAN 
(Editor's Note: The following
is the first of two articles by
Peter Duignan, head of the Afri
can curation of the Hoover Insti
tute of War, Revolution, and
Peace. Duignan's views on Africa
are opposed to the liberal views
expressed by Bowles and Hersko
vitz.)

Few countries in the world pos
sess closer links with the African
Continent than the United States.
After all, one out of every ten
Americans can boast of one or
more African ancestors. Further
more, Americans have long trad
ed with Africa; they have helped
to open up its interior as explor
ers and missionaries, while Negro-
Americans have exercised a pro
found influence upon African In
dependent Churches and different
types of African nationalism.
Today United States' interests
in Africa have become even more
immediate, for this once terra in
cognita is in danger of becoming
a battleground between East and
West. In light of recent changes,
American policy toward Africa is,
therefore, being reconsidered.
Many have come to the conclu
sion that the United States should
embark on a new course: Coloni
alism should be denounced; we
should back African nationalist
movements, even at the expense
of existing good relations with
those ol' our allies which still have
colonies on the continent. The
wliites in Africa shoidd be re
garded as a liability and aban
doned.
Now, admittedly, any liberal
minded student of African affairs
can agree with much in the
studies of Bowles, Herskovitz, and
the African League, but there also
seems to be a great deal of politi
cal naivete in these studies about
the realities of power politics.
Most dangerous is the point of
view that the United States should
sever its ties with the colonial
powers and identify itself solely
with the rising African national
ist movements. These writers
show that the African Continent
is vital to the West.
Here, moreover, American po
litical idealism still has a major
part to play. If Africa is to be
held, they argue, the black man's
confidence must be secured; the
"revolution of rising expectation"
and the drive toward racial equal
ity and political independence
must everywhere be accepted.
The United States, therefore,
must take the lead in liquidating
colonialism in Africa.
African nationalists should be
supported in the Trusteeship
Council and similar agencies; eco
nomic aid shoidd be given by
means of heavy capital invest
ments; pressure to get out of
Africa, moreover, thould be put
on America's NA TO allies.
Bowles, for example, accordingly
approves of British policy in coun
tries like Ghana, Pakistan, India,
Burma, Egypt, Israel, and the

Sudan, which marked "Britain's
capacity for Imagination, resil-;
ience and decisiveness under fire"
—a statement that would assur
edly cause some merriment in
Cairo and Jerusalem alike.
There really is not much force j
in the argument that the metro-1
politan countries should plan
their policies so as to win the
sympathy of the "uncommitted"
nations of Asia and Africa, which
are supposed to hold the future
world balance of power in their
hands.
This point of view neglects the
military realities of power and
looks upon the present struggle
for world supremacy as a sort of
ideological beauty competition in
which the panel of judges is made
up of Asians and Africans!
Nations are influenced by ideas,
but ideological considerations only
rarely outweigh economic and
startegic factors as the guiding
principles of a country's foreign
policy. In this respect, Asians and
Africans are no different from
anyone else and are not easily
influenced by gestures.
Not even the wholesale expul
sion of all whites from a country
like Northern Rhodesia would in
duce any African state to support
NATO, unless the ruling groups
of that state felt that its interests
were better served by joining the
West rather than by remaining
neutral.
It is doubtful how far the West
would be justified in subordinat
ing its interests to the real or
imagined demands of neutralists.
For when all is said and done, it
is only the strength of the West,
and nothing but its strength,
which has made it possible, up
to now, for the Afro-Asian coun
tries to afford the luxury of neu
tralism.
Once the West weakens, the
fate of the new countries is not
likely to be any different from
that of, say, the Georgian Social
Democrats, which were over
thrown by the Soviet armies after
the First World War. To look at
the question the other way round,
the friendship of all the uncom
mitted nations would not help the
West in the slightest if we allowed
our economic and military de
fenses to crumble.
The disintegration of western
power would only be speeded up
by the contraction of western in
fluence in areas inhabited by
white minorities in Africa; to
encourage this process can thus
hardly be described as being ad
vantageous to the United States.
Furthermore, the new African
states will have to contend with
difficulties arising from the inter
national situation. The new
"Scramble for Africa" is on. Tliis
new scramble, however, is being
fought with the weapons of dollar
and ruble loans, high-powered pro
paganda, the armed infiltration of
i irregulars, and the diplomatic and
1 military pressures of heavily
i armed continental blocs.

(Editor's Note: The following
is the first of two articles by
Peter Duignan, head of the Afri
can curation of the Hoover Insti
tute of War, Revolution, and
Peace. Duignan's views on Africa
are opposed to the liberal views
expressed by Bowles and Hersko
vitz.)

Few countries in the world pos
sess closer links with the African
Continent than the United States.
After all, one out of every ten
Americans can boast of one or
more African ancestors. Further
more, Americans have long trad
ed with Africa; they have helped
to open up its interior as explor
ers and missionaries, while Negro-
Americans have exercised a pro
found influence upon African In
dependent Churches and different
types of African nationalism.
Today United States' interests
in Africa have become even more
immediate, for this once terra in
cognita is in danger of becoming
a battleground between East and
West. In light of recent changes,
American policy toward Africa is,
therefore, being reconsidered.
Many have come to the conclu
sion that the United States should
embark on a new course: Coloni
alism should be denounced; we
should back African nationalist
movements, even at the expense
of existing good relations with
those ol' our allies which still have
colonies on the continent. The
wliites in Africa shoidd be re
garded as a liability and aban
doned.
Now, admittedly, any liberal
minded student of African affairs
can agree with much in the
studies of Bowles, Herskovitz, and
the African League, but there also
seems to be a great deal of politi
cal naivete in these studies about
the realities of power politics.
Most dangerous is the point of
view that the United States should
sever its ties with the colonial
powers and identify itself solely
with the rising African national
ist movements. These writers
show that the African Continent
is vital to the West.
Here, moreover, American po
litical idealism still has a major
part to play. If Africa is to be
held, they argue, the black man's
confidence must be secured; the
"revolution of rising expectation"
and the drive toward racial equal
ity and political independence
must everywhere be accepted.
The United States, therefore,
must take the lead in liquidating
colonialism in Africa.
African nationalists should be
supported in the Trusteeship
Council and similar agencies; eco
nomic aid shoidd be given by
means of heavy capital invest
ments; pressure to get out of
Africa, moreover, thould be put
on America's NA TO allies.
Bowles, for example, accordingly
approves of British policy in coun
tries like Ghana, Pakistan, India,
Burma, Egypt, Israel, and the

Sudan, which marked "Britain's
capacity for Imagination, resil-;
ience and decisiveness under fire"
—a statement that would assur
edly cause some merriment in
Cairo and Jerusalem alike.
There really is not much force j
in the argument that the metro-1
politan countries should plan
their policies so as to win the
sympathy of the "uncommitted"
nations of Asia and Africa, which
are supposed to hold the future
world balance of power in their
hands.
This point of view neglects the
military realities of power and
looks upon the present struggle
for world supremacy as a sort of
ideological beauty competition in
which the panel of judges is made
up of Asians and Africans!
Nations are influenced by ideas,
but ideological considerations only
rarely outweigh economic and
startegic factors as the guiding
principles of a country's foreign
policy. In this respect, Asians and
Africans are no different from
anyone else and are not easily
influenced by gestures.
Not even the wholesale expul
sion of all whites from a country
like Northern Rhodesia would in
duce any African state to support
NATO, unless the ruling groups
of that state felt that its interests
were better served by joining the
West rather than by remaining
neutral.
It is doubtful how far the West
would be justified in subordinat
ing its interests to the real or
imagined demands of neutralists.
For when all is said and done, it
is only the strength of the West,
and nothing but its strength,
which has made it possible, up
to now, for the Afro-Asian coun
tries to afford the luxury of neu
tralism.
Once the West weakens, the
fate of the new countries is not
likely to be any different from
that of, say, the Georgian Social
Democrats, which were over
thrown by the Soviet armies after
the First World War. To look at
the question the other way round,
the friendship of all the uncom
mitted nations would not help the
West in the slightest if we allowed
our economic and military de
fenses to crumble.
The disintegration of western
power would only be speeded up
by the contraction of western in
fluence in areas inhabited by
white minorities in Africa; to
encourage this process can thus
hardly be described as being ad

(Editor's Note: The following
is the first of two articles by
Peter Duignan, head of the Afri
can curation of the Hoover Insti
tute of War, Revolution, and
Peace. Duignan's views on Africa
are opposed to the liberal views
expressed by Bowles and Hersko
vitz.)

Few countries in the world pos
sess closer links with the African
Continent than the United States.
After all, one out of every ten
Americans can boast of one or
more African ancestors. Further
more, Americans have long trad
ed with Africa; they have helped
to open up its interior as explor
ers and missionaries, while Negro-
Americans have exercised a pro
found influence upon African In
dependent Churches and different
types of African nationalism.
Today United States' interests
in Africa have become even more
immediate, for this once terra in
cognita is in danger of becoming
a battleground between East and
West. In light of recent changes,
American policy toward Africa is,
therefore, being reconsidered.
Many have come to the conclu
sion that the United States should
embark on a new course: Coloni
alism should be denounced; we
should back African nationalist
movements, even at the expense
of existing good relations with
those ol' our allies which still have
colonies on the continent. The
wliites in Africa shoidd be re
garded as a liability and aban
doned.
Now, admittedly, any liberal
minded student of African affairs
can agree with much in the
studies of Bowles, Herskovitz, and
the African League, but there also
seems to be a great deal of politi
cal naivete in these studies about
the realities of power politics.
Most dangerous is the point of
view that the United States should
sever its ties with the colonial
powers and identify itself solely
with the rising African national
ist movements. These writers
show that the African Continent
is vital to the West.
Here, moreover, American po
litical idealism still has a major
part to play. If Africa is to be
held, they argue, the black man's
confidence must be secured; the
"revolution of rising expectation"
and the drive toward racial equal
ity and political independence
must everywhere be accepted.
The United States, therefore,
must take the lead in liquidating
colonialism in Africa.
African nationalists should be
supported in the Trusteeship
Council and similar agencies; eco
nomic aid shoidd be given by
means of heavy capital invest
ments; pressure to get out of
Africa, moreover, thould be put
on America's NA TO allies.
Bowles, for example, accordingly
approves of British policy in coun
tries like Ghana, Pakistan, India,
Burma, Egypt, Israel, and the

Sudan, which marked "Britain's
capacity for Imagination, resil-;
ience and decisiveness under fire"
—a statement that would assur
edly cause some merriment in
Cairo and Jerusalem alike.
There really is not much force j
in the argument that the metro-1
politan countries should plan
their policies so as to win the
sympathy of the "uncommitted"
nations of Asia and Africa, which
are supposed to hold the future
world balance of power in their
hands.
This point of view neglects the
military realities of power and
looks upon the present struggle
for world supremacy as a sort of
ideological beauty competition in
which the panel of judges is made
up of Asians and Africans!
Nations are influenced by ideas,
but ideological considerations only
rarely outweigh economic and
startegic factors as the guiding
principles of a country's foreign
policy. In this respect, Asians and
Africans are no different from
anyone else and are not easily
influenced by gestures.
Not even the wholesale expul
sion of all whites from a country
like Northern Rhodesia would in
duce any African state to support
NATO, unless the ruling groups
of that state felt that its interests
were better served by joining the
West rather than by remaining
neutral.
It is doubtful how far the West
would be justified in subordinat
ing its interests to the real or
imagined demands of neutralists.
For when all is said and done, it
is only the strength of the West,
and nothing but its strength,
which has made it possible, up
to now, for the Afro-Asian coun
tries to afford the luxury of neu
tralism.
Once the West weakens, the
fate of the new countries is not
