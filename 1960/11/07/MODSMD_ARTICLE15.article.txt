# Understanding of the Cuban Revolt
## 
### MIKE GORDON IIK Political Analyst 
During the last few weeks the;
Castro government in Cuba has
been increasing the furor of its
charge that an invasion by the
Yankee imperialists from the i
North is increasingly imminent.
At the same time it has stepped
up its suppression of all internal,
opposition.
The excuse given for both man
euvers is that they are designed!
to prevent counter-revolutionary |
reactions. Undoubtedly Castro and
his subordinates are not fright
ening the Cuban people for noth
ing; in fact, the threat of an in- j
vasion aided by internal factions
is, as far as the government is
concerned, no longer just a pos
sibility but a must.
For only by continual reference
to such a threat can the Castro
government continue to justify its
own course of action. This action,
which strikingly conflicts with
the democratic goals the revolu- j
tion had originally envisioned, is
complex; it becomes comprehen
sible only if the Cuban revolution
is viewed as one more example
of the course almost all modern
revolutions have taken —a course
toward increased power of the
states.
It seems, in fact, almost a role
of revolutionary movement that
a new government created by the
revolution (the so-called "revolu
tionary government") must, in
order to rationalize its very ex
istence, invariably become a war
government.
The reason that a revolutionary
government must be a war gov
ernment is that a revolutionary
government, as the French social
ist Proudhon claimed a century
ago, is itself a contradiction in
terms.
A revolution, first of all, pre
serves in politics the same mean
ing it has in science: a complete
rotation. In political life this ro
tation means that the existing so
cial and political structure is de
stroyed in favor of a new struc
ture. But as soon as the new gov
ernment enters power through a
revolutionary overthrow, the ro
tating movement begins to de
scribe a different circle than what
the revolution originally con
ceived. The revolution, in other
words, ceases to follow its revo
lutionary course when it becomes
stabilized in a government.
Exactly at this point the revo
lutionary followers, in order to
continue their zealous faith in the
revolutionary doctrine, are eon
fronted with a momentous deci
sion. Either they acknowledge
that the movement of the revolu
tion has forced the doctrine out
of conformity with the reality of

events, or they alter the doctrine
to conform to that reality.
Since most men, especially revo- j
lutionary zealots, are reluctant to'
relinquish power once they ob
tain it, they generally choose the'
latter course of altering Ihe doc
trine.
Rut the revolutionary leaders
can never admit publicly that they !
have, to all effect, abandoned their
revolution; probably they do not
even admit it consciously to them
selves. Instead and this com
pletes the analysis they resort
to conjuring up the bogey of an
enemy and becoming a "war gov
ernment."
Today the bearded leaders of
the 20th of July Revolution in
Cuba seem to have taken such a
course: the revolutionary law in
I Cuba is now supreme. But the
1 leaders continue to insist as all
pre viou s revolutionaries have,
from Jacobinism in 1789 to Com
munism in the twentieth century
that they have squared the
circle; that they have founded a
revolutionary government that
really embodies the or iginal revo
| lutionary aims.
To impress their logic upon the
Cuban people, the present Cuban
leaders have begun to fill their
prisons, which were once emptied
during the purge of ltatista forc
es, with numerous opponents —
counter-revolutionary opponents.
They have projected the com
ing free elections far into the fu
ture; why have elections, when
the revolution is being fulfilled
now? They have suppressed all
freedom of the press, universi
ties, and trade unions; in fact
freedom in Cuba now means ad
herence to the meaning the revo
lutionary government has given
it. And this meaning fluctuates
at the discretion of the govern
ment.

Simultaneously, in foreign poli
cy, the former period of rap
prochement with the Unit e d
States, which the Castro regime
seemed to work for during its
first few months in existence, sud
denly yielded to the period of
revanche.
Hatred of the United States im
perialists, which was once reason
able enough considering that
country's support of Batista, has
now become intensified beyond
all reason itself.
For the hatred is no longer just
the spontaneous emotional out
pour of an aggrieved Cuban
people; it is the calculated policy
of the "revolutionary" Cuban gov
ernment to remain in power.
Castro, in short, has found the
bogey by which to justify the
movement of Ins "war" regime
toward demagogic authoritarian
ism.

have, to all effect, abandoned their
revolution; probably they do not
even admit it consciously to them

pletes the analysis they resort
to conjuring up the bogey of an
enemy and becoming a "war gov
ernment."
Today the bearded leaders of
the 20th of July Revolution in
Cuba seem to have taken such a
course: the revolutionary law in
I Cuba is now supreme. But the
1 leaders continue to insist as all
pre viou s revolutionaries have,
from Jacobinism in 1789 to Com
munism in the twentieth century
that they have squared the
circle; that they have founded a
revolutionary government that
really embodies the or iginal revo
| lutionary aims.
To impress their logic upon the
Cuban people, the present Cuban
leaders have begun to fill their
prisons, which were once emptied
during the purge of ltatista forc
es, with numerous opponents —
counter-revolutionary opponents.
They have projected the com
ing free elections far into the fu
ture; why have elections, when
the revolution is being fulfilled
now? They have suppressed all
freedom of the press, universi
ties, and trade unions; in fact
freedom in Cuba now means ad
herence to the meaning the revo
lutionary government has given
it. And this meaning fluctuates
at the discretion of the govern
ment.

Simultaneously, in foreign poli
cy, the former period of rap
prochement with the Unit e d
States, which the Castro regime
seemed to work for during its
first few months in existence, sud
denly yielded to the period of
revanche.
Hatred of the United States im
perialists, which was once reason
able enough considering that
country's support of Batista, has
now become intensified beyond
all reason itself.
For the hatred is no longer just
the spontaneous emotional out
pour of an aggrieved Cuban
people; it is the calculated policy
of the "revolutionary" Cuban gov
ernment to remain in power.
Castro, in short, has found the
bogey by which to justify the
movement of Ins "war" regime
toward demagogic authoritarian
ism.
During the last few weeks the;
Castro government in Cuba has
been increasing the furor of its
charge that an invasion by the
Yankee imperialists from the i
North is increasingly imminent.
At the same time it has stepped
up its suppression of all internal,
opposition.
The excuse given for both man
euvers is that they are designed!
to prevent counter-revolutionary |
reactions. Undoubtedly Castro and
his subordinates are not fright
ening the Cuban people for noth
ing; in fact, the threat of an in- j
vasion aided by internal factions
is, as far as the government is
concerned, no longer just a pos
sibility but a must.
For only by continual reference
to such a threat can the Castro
government continue to justify its
own course of action. This action,
which strikingly conflicts with
the democratic goals the revolu- j
tion had originally envisioned, is
complex; it becomes comprehen
sible only if the Cuban revolution
is viewed as one more example
of the course almost all modern
revolutions have taken —a course
toward increased power of the
states.
It seems, in fact, almost a role
of revolutionary movement that
a new government created by the
revolution (the so-called "revolu
tionary government") must, in
order to rationalize its very ex
istence, invariably become a war
government.
The reason that a revolutionary
government must be a war gov
ernment is that a revolutionary
government, as the French social
ist Proudhon claimed a century
ago, is itself a contradiction in
terms.
A revolution, first of all, pre
serves in politics the same mean
ing it has in science: a complete
rotation. In political life this ro
tation means that the existing so
cial and political structure is de
stroyed in favor of a new struc
ture. But as soon as the new gov
ernment enters power through a
revolutionary overthrow, the ro
tating movement begins to de
scribe a different circle than what
the revolution originally con
ceived. The revolution, in other
words, ceases to follow its revo
lutionary course when it becomes
stabilized in a government.
Exactly at this point the revo
lutionary followers, in order to
continue their zealous faith in the
revolutionary doctrine, are eon
fronted with a momentous deci
sion. Either they acknowledge
that the movement of the revolu
tion has forced the doctrine out
of conformity with the reality of

events, or they alter the doctrine
to conform to that reality.
Since most men, especially revo- j
lutionary zealots, are reluctant to'
relinquish power once they ob
tain it, they generally choose the'
latter course of altering Ihe doc
trine.

concerned, no longer just a pos
sibility but a must.
For only by continual reference
to such a threat can the Castro
government continue to justify its
own course of action. This action,
which strikingly conflicts with
the democratic goals the revolu- j
tion had originally envisioned, is
complex; it becomes comprehen
sible only if the Cuban revolution
is viewed as one more example
of the course almost all modern
revolutions have taken —a course
toward increased power of the
states.
It seems, in fact, almost a role
of revolutionary movement that
a new government created by the
revolution (the so-called "revolu
tionary government") must, in
order to rationalize its very ex
istence, invariably become a war
government.
The reason that a revolutionary
government must be a war gov
ernment is that a revolutionary
government, as the French social
ist Proudhon claimed a century
ago, is itself a contradiction in
terms.
A revolution, first of all, pre
serves in politics the same mean
ing it has in science: a complete
rotation. In political life this ro
tation means that the existing so
cial and political structure is de
stroyed in favor of a new struc
ture. But as soon as the new gov
ernment enters power through a
revolutionary overthrow, the ro
tating movement begins to de
scribe a different circle than what
the revolution originally con
ceived. The revolution, in other
words, ceases to follow its revo
lutionary course when it becomes
stabilized in a government.
Exactly at this point the revo
lutionary followers, in order to
continue their zealous faith in the
revolutionary doctrine, are eon
fronted with a momentous deci
sion. Either they acknowledge
that the movement of the revolu
tion has forced the doctrine out
of conformity with the reality of

events, or they alter the doctrine
to conform to that reality.
Since most men, especially revo- j
lutionary zealots, are reluctant to'
relinquish power once they ob
tain it, they generally choose the'
latter course of altering Ihe doc
trine.
Rut the revolutionary leaders
can never admit publicly that they !
have, to all effect, abandoned their
revolution; probably they do not
even admit it consciously to them
selves. Instead and this com
pletes the analysis they resort
to conjuring up the bogey of an
enemy and becoming a "war gov
ernment."
Today the bearded leaders of
the 20th of July Revolution in
Cuba seem to have taken such a
course: the revolutionary law in
I Cuba is now supreme. But the
1 leaders continue to insist as all
pre viou s revolutionaries have,
from Jacobinism in 1789 to Com
munism in the twentieth century
that they have squared the
circle; that they have founded a
revolutionary government that
really embodies the or iginal revo
| lutionary aims.
To impress their logic upon the
Cuban people, the present Cuban
leaders have begun to fill their
prisons, which were once emptied
during the purge of ltatista forc
es, with numerous opponents —
counter-revolutionary opponents.
They have projected the com
ing free elections far into the fu
ture; why have elections, when
the revolution is being fulfilled
now? They have suppressed all
freedom of the press, universi
ties, and trade unions; in fact
freedom in Cuba now means ad
herence to the meaning the revo
lutionary government has given
it. And this meaning fluctuates
at the discretion of the govern
ment.

Simultaneously, in foreign poli
cy, the former period of rap
prochement with the Unit e d
States, which the Castro regime
seemed to work for during its
first few months in existence, sud
denly yielded to the period of
revanche.
Hatred of the United States im
perialists, which was once reason
able enough considering that
country's support of Batista, has
now become intensified beyond
all reason itself.
For the hatred is no longer just
the spontaneous emotional out
pour of an aggrieved Cuban
people; it is the calculated policy
of the "revolutionary" Cuban gov
ernment to remain in power.
Castro, in short, has found the
bogey by which to justify the
movement of Ins "war" regime
toward demagogic authoritarian
ism.
During the last few weeks the;
Castro government in Cuba has
been increasing the furor of its
charge that an invasion by the
Yankee imperialists from the i
North is increasingly imminent.
At the same time it has stepped
up its suppression of all internal,
opposition.
The excuse given for both man
euvers is that they are designed!
to prevent counter-revolutionary |
reactions. Undoubtedly Castro and
his subordinates are not fright
ening the Cuban people for noth
ing; in fact, the threat of an in- j
vasion aided by internal factions
is, as far as the government is
concerned, no longer just a pos
sibility but a must.
