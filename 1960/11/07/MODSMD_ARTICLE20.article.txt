# Finding a Job Gets Tougher
## 
### 
BERKELEY (UPI) â€” Now col
lege graduates are finding it
tougher to gel a job, and for those
with some experience the chances
of finding new employment are
slim, according to a report issued
yesterday by the University of
California's Employment Center.
It is even becoming hard to
place engineers in the electronics
and missiles industries, which
until recently were starving for
talent, the report said.
Many companies have actually
imposed a "hiring freeze" on ex
perienced personnel, said Robert
Calvert Jr., who runs the Student
and Alumni Placement Center
here, which annually helps more
than 4,000 graduates look for
jobs.
BUT, lll*] said, it was a "seem
ing enigma" that, while saying
"no" to anyone who has already
been tried in the field, employers
were going out aggressively after
new inexperienced graduates. This
was attributed to the higher sal
aries demanded by experienced
job-seekers and by the desire of
employers to maintain large pools
of high-turnover, low-paid em
ployes from which the best can
didates can be chosen for man
agerial and executive positions.
The current slump in graduate
placements began last May, Cal
vert said, and"the volume of job
listings now being received is
clearly lower than at this lime
last year."
SOMK ARIOAK still remain
bright, he added, especially for
graduates with master's or doc
tor's degrees. The best fields right
now are engineering, science,
mathematics, business and ac
counting.
Starting salaries for graduates
are up 3 to 5 per cent over a year
ago, the report said, with an
average of from $565 a month for
electrical engineers to $325 a
month for women liberal arts
graduates. Men with liberal arts
degrees get about $199 a month
to start.
