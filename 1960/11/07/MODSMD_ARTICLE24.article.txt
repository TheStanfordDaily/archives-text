# GROSZ, JONES STAR FOR WEBFOOTS
## Ducks Hand Cards Eighth Loss, 27-6 
### RUSS ALLEN 
M U LTNOMA H STADIUM,
Portland, Oregon. Stanford grid
dors went out to a slick field and
under clear skies after their first
win of the season last Saturday
and, for the eighth consecutive
time, they came back on the short
side of the score a (3 to 27 defeat
by Oregon.
The Webfoots, led by quarter
back Dave Grosz and halfback
Cleveland Jones, ran a r o un d,
through and over the Indian sec
ondary to score three touchdowns
in the first half and another in
lhe final quarter.
ORIitiON won the toss and took
charge of the game from that
point on. Quarterback Grosz di
rected the team to a quick score.
The drive featured end sweeps by
Jones, a 38-yard pass play as Duck
end Len Burnett delayed then
went light up the middle to take
the toss which caught the Indian
secondary napping.
Grosz ran the option once and
on the next play handed to full
back Bruce Snyder, who blasted
into the Card end zone.
The Indians did not seem affec
ted by the quick Duck touchdown
as Dick Norman looked like the
Norman of old and quickly di
rected the Tribe to an evening
score. Skip Face missed his first
extrapoint attempt after 16 con
secutive successful kicks, and lhe
Indians were behind 7-6 after five
minutes of play.
IN THE Stanford touchdown
drive Norman mixed passing and
running to gain the score. Nor
man opened up with handoffs to
Face and halfback Gil Dowd for
a quick first down. Nexi he threw
a 13-yard pass to Dowd. and Duck
center Joe Clesceri was called for
using that famous McKeever play
—the quick elbow and Stanford
gained 15 more yards toward the
Duck goal.
Then Norman rolled out and
passed to sophomore end Steve
Pursell who grabber! it and was
run out of bounds on the Duck
one-yard line. Dowd bulled it over
for the touchdown and the Indians
were on the scoreboard.
THE REMAINDER of the quar
ter saw the Ducks- led by the!
running, passing and deceptive
ball handling of Grosz gain a lot
of yardage against the Cards. But
at the key points in the Duck
drives a hard Stanford tackle
would jar loose the ball from a
Duck back and the Indians would
get another chance.
In the second quarter it was
all Oregon as every time the
Cards would get their hands on
the ball they couldn't move for a i
fii.st down and Norman seemed to j
lose his touch.
Oregon scored twice quickly j
and electrifyingly in the middle
of this period. After the Indians j
tightened up and stopped the.
Duck running game, Grosz rolled
out twice to his left and twice
passed back to his flanker Jones
in the right corner of the Indian :
endzone for two quick scores.
AT THE end of the half the
Ducks were ahead 20-6 and had '
outgained the Tribe in the air and
on the ground, 296 yards total
offense to 47 yards total for Stan-1
ford. The Ducks also gained a
16-3 first down lead.
Although the Ducks had com
pletely dominated the game in the I
first half, Stanford came out with
their defense shaken up and be-;
gan to play the Ducks on even |
terms.
Linemen Jack Gordon, Dean I
Hinshaw, Tom Walsh, and Don j
Peter began to open up big holes :
in the Duck defensive lines and 1
backs Dowd, Hal Steuber and j
Face began to mark off gains at
five to ten yards a carry.
HOWEVER, throughout the
third quarter the Indians could ;
not get any sustained drives go-1

ing as Norman's passing proved
definitely off and it seemed that
the able quarterback was defi
nitely having an off day.
Finally in the middle of the
final quarter Stanford recovered
a Duck fumble inside the Card
20-yard line. On the second play
Norman about to be tackled—
pitched out to trailer back Face
but the pitchout was right at his

I feet and Oregon recovered the
ball on the Stanford 15-yard line.
THE DUCKS finally drove in
j for the final score and the game
; ended with the Ducks on top 27-6.
Once again individual Stanford
| gridders stood out in play Satur
; day but that one spark that .causes
! teams to jell, play good together
and win the game failed to ignite.
I C. B. Simons, Walsh, Hinshaw

and Toorvald looked good and
aggressive in the line. Steuber and
Dowd were outstanding in their
ball-carrying, so perhaps maybe
this weekend they will finally get
together and grab off their first
win against the visiting Oregon
State Beavers.

Then Norman rolled out and
passed to sophomore end Steve
Pursell who grabber! it and was
run out of bounds on the Duck
one-yard line. Dowd bulled it over
for the touchdown and the Indians
were on the scoreboard.
THE REMAINDER of the quar
ter saw the Ducks- led by the!
running, passing and deceptive
ball handling of Grosz gain a lot
of yardage against the Cards. But
at the key points in the Duck
drives a hard Stanford tackle
would jar loose the ball from a
Duck back and the Indians would
get another chance.
In the second quarter it was
all Oregon as every time the
Cards would get their hands on
the ball they couldn't move for a i
fii.st down and Norman seemed to j
lose his touch.
Oregon scored twice quickly j
and electrifyingly in the middle
of this period. After the Indians j
tightened up and stopped the.
Duck running game, Grosz rolled
out twice to his left and twice
passed back to his flanker Jones
in the right corner of the Indian :
endzone for two quick scores.
AT THE end of the half the
Ducks were ahead 20-6 and had '
outgained the Tribe in the air and
on the ground, 296 yards total
offense to 47 yards total for Stan-1
ford. The Ducks also gained a
16-3 first down lead.
Although the Ducks had com
pletely dominated the game in the I
first half, Stanford came out with
their defense shaken up and be-;
gan to play the Ducks on even |
terms.
Linemen Jack Gordon, Dean I
Hinshaw, Tom Walsh, and Don j
Peter began to open up big holes :
in the Duck defensive lines and 1
backs Dowd, Hal Steuber and j
Face began to mark off gains at
five to ten yards a carry.
HOWEVER, throughout the
third quarter the Indians could ;
not get any sustained drives go-1

ing as Norman's passing proved
definitely off and it seemed that
the able quarterback was defi
nitely having an off day.
Finally in the middle of the
final quarter Stanford recovered
a Duck fumble inside the Card
20-yard line. On the second play
Norman about to be tackled—
pitched out to trailer back Face
but the pitchout was right at his

I feet and Oregon recovered the
ball on the Stanford 15-yard line.
THE DUCKS finally drove in
j for the final score and the game
; ended with the Ducks on top 27-6.
Once again individual Stanford
| gridders stood out in play Satur
; day but that one spark that .causes
! teams to jell, play good together
and win the game failed to ignite.
I C. B. Simons, Walsh, Hinshaw

and Toorvald looked good and
aggressive in the line. Steuber and
Dowd were outstanding in their
ball-carrying, so perhaps maybe
this weekend they will finally get
together and grab off their first
win against the visiting Oregon
State Beavers.

third quarter the Indians could ;
not get any sustained drives go-1

ing as Norman's passing proved
definitely off and it seemed that
the able quarterback was defi
nitely having an off day.
Finally in the middle of the
final quarter Stanford recovered
a Duck fumble inside the Card
20-yard line. On the second play
Norman about to be tackled—
pitched out to trailer back Face
but the pitchout was right at his

I feet and Oregon recovered the
ball on the Stanford 15-yard line.
THE DUCKS finally drove in
j for the final score and the game
; ended with the Ducks on top 27-6.
Once again individual Stanford
| gridders stood out in play Satur
; day but that one spark that .causes
! teams to jell, play good together
and win the game failed to ignite.
I C. B. Simons, Walsh, Hinshaw

and Toorvald looked good and
aggressive in the line. Steuber and
Dowd were outstanding in their
ball-carrying, so perhaps maybe
this weekend they will finally get
together and grab off their first
win against the visiting Oregon
State Beavers.

FULLBACK BRUCE SNYDER SWEEPS LEFT END
Ducks Dave Grayson (30) takes out Cards' Face (42)
M U LTNOMA H STADIUM,
Portland, Oregon. Stanford grid
dors went out to a slick field and
under clear skies after their first
win of the season last Saturday
and, for the eighth consecutive
time, they came back on the short
side of the score a (3 to 27 defeat
by Oregon.
The Webfoots, led by quarter
back Dave Grosz and halfback
Cleveland Jones, ran a r o un d,
through and over the Indian sec
ondary to score three touchdowns
in the first half and another in
lhe final quarter.
ORIitiON won the toss and took
charge of the game from that
point on. Quarterback Grosz di
rected the team to a quick score.
The drive featured end sweeps by
Jones, a 38-yard pass play as Duck
end Len Burnett delayed then
went light up the middle to take
the toss which caught the Indian
secondary napping.
Grosz ran the option once and
on the next play handed to full
back Bruce Snyder, who blasted
into the Card end zone.
The Indians did not seem affec
ted by the quick Duck touchdown
as Dick Norman looked like the
Norman of old and quickly di
rected the Tribe to an evening
score. Skip Face missed his first
extrapoint attempt after 16 con
secutive successful kicks, and lhe
Indians were behind 7-6 after five
minutes of play.
IN THE Stanford touchdown
drive Norman mixed passing and
running to gain the score. Nor
man opened up with handoffs to
Face and halfback Gil Dowd for
a quick first down. Nexi he threw
a 13-yard pass to Dowd. and Duck
center Joe Clesceri was called for
using that famous McKeever play
—the quick elbow and Stanford
gained 15 more yards toward the
Duck goal.
Then Norman rolled out and
passed to sophomore end Steve
Pursell who grabber! it and was
run out of bounds on the Duck
one-yard line. Dowd bulled it over
for the touchdown and the Indians
were on the scoreboard.
THE REMAINDER of the quar
ter saw the Ducks- led by the!
running, passing and deceptive
ball handling of Grosz gain a lot
of yardage against the Cards. But
at the key points in the Duck
drives a hard Stanford tackle
would jar loose the ball from a
Duck back and the Indians would
get another chance.
In the second quarter it was
all Oregon as every time the
Cards would get their hands on
the ball they couldn't move for a i
fii.st down and Norman seemed to j
lose his touch.
Oregon scored twice quickly j
and electrifyingly in the middle
of this period. After the Indians j
tightened up and stopped the.
Duck running game, Grosz rolled
out twice to his left and twice
passed back to his flanker Jones
in the right corner of the Indian :
endzone for two quick scores.
AT THE end of the half the
Ducks were ahead 20-6 and had '
outgained the Tribe in the air and
on the ground, 296 yards total
offense to 47 yards total for Stan-1
ford. The Ducks also gained a
16-3 first down lead.
Although the Ducks had com
pletely dominated the game in the I
first half, Stanford came out with
their defense shaken up and be-;
gan to play the Ducks on even |
terms.
Linemen Jack Gordon, Dean I
Hinshaw, Tom Walsh, and Don j
Peter began to open up big holes :
in the Duck defensive lines and 1
backs Dowd, Hal Steuber and j
Face began to mark off gains at
five to ten yards a carry.
HOWEVER, throughout the
third quarter the Indians could ;
not get any sustained drives go-1
