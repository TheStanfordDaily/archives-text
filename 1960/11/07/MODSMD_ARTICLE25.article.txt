## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Stanford's cross country run
ners continued to show improve
ment Saturday, upsetting UCLA's
harriers while losing to Cal in a
triangular encounter at Berkeley.
Led by rapidly progressing Rich
Klier, ihe Card distance men
nosed out the Bruins 27 to 28 in
dual meet scoring. But Cal de
feated the Indians 25 to 34 and
the triangular count was Cal 33,
Stanford 46, UCLA 51.
KLILR covered the four-mile
distance in 19:50, to finish only
five seconds behind Alan Gaylord,
Berkeley's star distance runner.
Last week, running over his home
course, Klier trailed by 14 sec
onds. indicating that he is catch
ing up on the Bear standout.
Also noteworthy was the fine
showing of freshman Bill Pratt,
who cemented his hold on the
number two spot among the In
dian harriers. Pratt finished sixth
in 20:19, running practically a
dead heat with Cal's second man,
Alan Covington, who came in
fifth.
John North way turned in his
best race in several weeks as he
was seventh, right ahead of five
Cal runners. The fine bunching
shown by the Bears, who placed
seven in the top 12, turned the
tables on Stanford, who used this
startegy to upset USC last week.
LARRY SHAFER, an unher
alded freshman, placed among the
top five Indians for the first time
this year, coming in right behind
Robin Ruble. Shafer is a steady,
unspectacular runner who gets
the job done.

The victory against UCLA re- !
: versed an earlier defeat at the
[ hands of the Bruins, in a meet at
Los Angeles. At that time both |
Mil Dahl and Walt Maxwell fin- !
ished ahead of Klier, but Satur- j
day the two Bruins were third ;
j and fourth respectively.
Once again the placing of the
j-fifth man was the deciding factor
j for the Indians. Ruble and Shafer
were far back in the pack of run
j ners, yet if either of them had
j failed to beat the fifth UCLA run
, ner, who finished 17th, the meet
i would have been lost.
C OAC II Pay ton Jordan was
| quite encouraged by the team, ef
j fort, as for the second time in
two weeks Stanford has upset a
team which beat them earlier in
; the year. "We are right on the
verge of real team running,"
added the coach, praised the
work of Klier, Pratt, North way.
and Shafer.
The Indians have developed a
pattern of upsetting schools which
beat them the first time around.
They get one more chance against
Ca! on Tuesday, November 15th. j
On the basis of their improve
ment so far, Klier should have a
good chance to beat Gaylord, and |
the same applies to Pratt and !
Covington.
But the real key to victory lie
with the balance of the team.
Stanford's Ruble, Shafer. Dave |
Boore, and Frank Wallace must
come through for the Indians.
