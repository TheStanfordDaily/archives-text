# Papooses Edge Bearcubs as Frosh Cheer Selves Silly

### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
What must ho the red-hottest bunch of freshmmen to come to the Farm in ages showed up at the
Stadium Saturday and watched the Stanford freshmen come from behind twice to beat the California
frosh, 18-14, in the annual Little Big Game.
Easily half the freshman class sat in cold, drizzly gloom and shouted themselves silly as iho Pa
pooses closed out the four-game season with their first win. They had lost one and tied two previously.

S t a n 112 or d quarterback Steve
Thurlow cracked over from the
one-yard line with two minutes
and seventeen seconds left in the
game for the winning tally.
TIIURLOWS touchdown came
after tackle Bob Nichols recov
ered a fumble by Cal signal caller
Bill Brown on the visitor's 17 yard
line with less than five minutes to
play.
The Papooses opened the scor
ing in the first quarter when half
back Tony DeLillis picked off a
pass by Paul lloeber on the Stan
lord 28 and threaded his way
down the sideline for a 72-yard
runback and a touchdown. Roger
McNitt's kick for the extra point
was blocked.
Cal took the lead early in the
second quarter when lloeber
capped a 62-yard drive with a
three-yard plunge into the end
/one and Bob Collins' kick for the
extra point was good.
THE PAPOOSES scored just
before the half ended when Tyce
Fitzmorris took a pitchout from
quarterback Jim Norman and
went five yards around his right
end for the score. Fitzmorris' tally
climaxed a 61-yard drive which
featured several long gainers by
Mike Barnes who. along with Fitz
morris, was the outstanding Stan
ford runner of t he day.
Norman passed the try for
point but it was knocked down in
the end zone.
The halftime performance by a
makeshift freshman band and the
pom-pon girls added a unique
note to the game as the band
formed a '6-1 the pom-ponners
were the apostrophe and blar< d
out the fight songs in fine fashion.
Just before the teams came back
for the second half, the stands
emptied and formed a path for
the St anf or d gridders that
stretched from the Stadium en
trance to the 50-yard line.
STANFORD promptly got back
into trouble early in the third
quarter as a Steve Thurlow pass
was intercepted by Walt Hartwell
on the Tribe 21. Hartwell wasted
no time in running it back for the
score. Collins' kick was good once
again and the Cubs led 14-12.
Neither team could do much
after that until Nichols recov
ered Brown's fumble with time
running out.
Not to be outdone by their up
perclass counterparts, the frosh
rooting section called for the
team. Speeches were made all
around and somebody mentioned
that it was the first time a Stan
ford team had won a football
game all year. Maybe it was in
dicative of a somewhat bigger
Big Game to be played in a couple
of weeks. You can always hope.
