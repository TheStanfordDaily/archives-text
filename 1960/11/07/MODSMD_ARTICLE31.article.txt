# Booters Lose to CCSF Soccer Squad by 5-1; Drop to First Place Tie
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
, Stanford is no longer in undis
puted first place in the West
1 Coast Soccer League following a !
I 5-1 loss to City College of San'
Francisco on the winner's field j
; Saturday.
City College's win enabled them
j to slip into a three-way tie for |
first place along with California
land Stanford.
THE ABSENCE of two of Stan-!
j ford's top players from the start
ing lineup hampered the Indian
efforts. Top defensive back Jan
: Achenbach suited up but didn't
j play due to an injured ankle. Play
maker Rune Engebrettsen also,
, didn't suit up. «
Rain which fell steadily during j
the game put four-wheel brakes
j on the In d i a n s ' fast-moving ;
! attack. Instead, Stanford had to
J rely on a slow-moving p o we r
I attack, for which they are un- j
i suited.
The first quarter was a portent j
of things to come. Even without 1
scoring a goal, the Rams were
I awesome. In the first few min
j utes, the shifty Ram forwards
dominated play, having two drives
: stopped only because well-placed
shots hit the goal net supports.
THE FIRST score came with
I 10 minutes gone in the first quar
| tor on the first of CCSFer Dick
j Bowker's two goals. Dave Kings
ley made the second marker of i
the first period a few minutes
later on a 30-yard shot that caughtj
Stanford goalie Beau Bianchi out j
of position.
CCSF scored quickly again in !
the second quarter on a quick
shot by freshman centerforward j
Ai Korbus. After that. Stanford i
' toughened up considerably and I
the defense led by Bernie Knaggs, ,
Dan Farthing and Bianchi stifled!
the San Franciscans effectively!
for most of the remainder of the j
game.
City College got two quick goals
in the fourth quarter, both as a
result of momentary mental j
lapses in the backfield.
FINALLY, with two minutes I
left in the game, Stanford got
its only real chance in the game
to cheer. Emmanuel Andah. with ;
the assistance of a perfect pass
by Adam Bianchi, broke the Stan- j
ford scoring ice to make the score
the final of 5-1.
The only word to describe the
CCSF defense is AMAZING. The j
back line of fullbacks Zumot and
Dudum and centerhalf Papara
Consistently kept Stanford with!
I their backs to the goal net.
However, with all said about j
CCSF's backfield. and high-scor- j
ing front line, most praise must
be directed to the two goalies, i
Stanford's Beau Bianchi and
CCSF's Gary Delong.
BIANCHI performed very well.
Three of the opposition scores j
came as a result of backfield mix
ups and not through any short- j
comings of Bianchi's.
Delong didn't have too much i
work because of the support!
given him by the backfield, but
he personally saved two goals.
Emmanuel Andah had broken
through the defense with the ball j
and driven for the goal. Delong I
came out of the goal as Andah
shot a hard screamer to the goal,
he jumped high in the air and
deflected the ball, which seemed
destined to go over his head and '
in for a score.
Dolong's s e c on d great save ;
came when a stray pass went un- j
der his dive toward the goal. The
ball slowed down, but rolled re
lentlessly to the goal. Delong
jumped up and made a second
dive at the ball, deflecting it with
i his fingertips just outside the net. ,

Stanford won its sixth straight
junior varsity game 2-1 over the
City College JV's. The game was
sloppily played in the mud.
STANFORD struck quickly in
the first half as Don Burr lobbed a
shot over an awestruck CCSF
goalie's head. The goalie looked
as if Ik 1 were afraid to touch the
ball as it sailed into the net.
Stanford's Bob Rhodes, the
offensive star of the game, scored
with 1:20 left in the first half to
give Stan 112 or d a 2-0 edge, hut
CCSF still had time to make their
only goal of the game with sec
onds left in the half.
The second half was scoreless,
with the play of Stanford's Bob
Cormack and Hunt Bascom domi
nating the game. With 57 seconds
left in the game. Stanford applied
the clincher goal. It was Rhodes
who put the ball into the net.

jumped up and made a second

i his fingertips just outside the net. ,

Stanford won its sixth straight
junior varsity game 2-1 over the
City College JV's. The game was
sloppily played in the mud.
STANFORD struck quickly in
the first half as Don Burr lobbed a
shot over an awestruck CCSF
goalie's head. The goalie looked
as if Ik 1 were afraid to touch the
ball as it sailed into the net.
Stanford's Bob Rhodes, the
offensive star of the game, scored
with 1:20 left in the first half to
give Stan 112 or d a 2-0 edge, hut
CCSF still had time to make their
only goal of the game with sec
onds left in the half.
The second half was scoreless,
with the play of Stanford's Bob
Cormack and Hunt Bascom domi
nating the game. With 57 seconds
left in the game. Stanford applied
the clincher goal. It was Rhodes
who put the ball into the net.
, Stanford is no longer in undis
puted first place in the West
1 Coast Soccer League following a !
I 5-1 loss to City College of San'
Francisco on the winner's field j
; Saturday.
City College's win enabled them
j to slip into a three-way tie for |
first place along with California
land Stanford.
THE ABSENCE of two of Stan-!
j ford's top players from the start
ing lineup hampered the Indian
efforts. Top defensive back Jan
: Achenbach suited up but didn't
j play due to an injured ankle. Play
maker Rune Engebrettsen also,
, didn't suit up. «
Rain which fell steadily during j
the game put four-wheel brakes
j on the In d i a n s ' fast-moving ;
! attack. Instead, Stanford had to
J rely on a slow-moving p o we r
I attack, for which they are un- j
i suited.
The first quarter was a portent j
of things to come. Even without 1
scoring a goal, the Rams were
I awesome. In the first few min
j utes, the shifty Ram forwards
dominated play, having two drives
: stopped only because well-placed
shots hit the goal net supports.
THE FIRST score came with
I 10 minutes gone in the first quar
| tor on the first of CCSFer Dick
j Bowker's two goals. Dave Kings
ley made the second marker of i
the first period a few minutes
later on a 30-yard shot that caughtj
Stanford goalie Beau Bianchi out j
of position.
CCSF scored quickly again in !
the second quarter on a quick
shot by freshman centerforward j
Ai Korbus. After that. Stanford i
' toughened up considerably and I
the defense led by Bernie Knaggs, ,
Dan Farthing and Bianchi stifled!
the San Franciscans effectively!
for most of the remainder of the j
game.
City College got two quick goals
in the fourth quarter, both as a
result of momentary mental j
lapses in the backfield.
FINALLY, with two minutes I
left in the game, Stanford got
its only real chance in the game
to cheer. Emmanuel Andah. with ;
the assistance of a perfect pass
by Adam Bianchi, broke the Stan- j
ford scoring ice to make the score
the final of 5-1.
The only word to describe the
CCSF defense is AMAZING. The j
back line of fullbacks Zumot and
Dudum and centerhalf Papara
Consistently kept Stanford with!
I their backs to the goal net.
However, with all said about j
CCSF's backfield. and high-scor- j
ing front line, most praise must
be directed to the two goalies, i
Stanford's Beau Bianchi and
CCSF's Gary Delong.
BIANCHI performed very well.
Three of the opposition scores j
came as a result of backfield mix
ups and not through any short- j
comings of Bianchi's.

work because of the support!
given him by the backfield, but

by Adam Bianchi, broke the Stan- j
ford scoring ice to make the score
the final of 5-1.
The only word to describe the
CCSF defense is AMAZING. The j
back line of fullbacks Zumot and
Dudum and centerhalf Papara
Consistently kept Stanford with!
I their backs to the goal net.
However, with all said about j
CCSF's backfield. and high-scor- j
ing front line, most praise must
be directed to the two goalies, i
Stanford's Beau Bianchi and
CCSF's Gary Delong.
BIANCHI performed very well.
Three of the opposition scores j
came as a result of backfield mix
ups and not through any short- j
comings of Bianchi's.
Delong didn't have too much i
work because of the support!
given him by the backfield, but
he personally saved two goals.
Emmanuel Andah had broken
through the defense with the ball j
and driven for the goal. Delong I
came out of the goal as Andah
shot a hard screamer to the goal,
he jumped high in the air and
deflected the ball, which seemed
destined to go over his head and '
in for a score.
Dolong's s e c on d great save ;
came when a stray pass went un- j
der his dive toward the goal. The
ball slowed down, but rolled re
lentlessly to the goal. Delong
jumped up and made a second
dive at the ball, deflecting it with
i his fingertips just outside the net. ,

Stanford won its sixth straight
junior varsity game 2-1 over the
City College JV's. The game was
sloppily played in the mud.
STANFORD struck quickly in
the first half as Don Burr lobbed a
shot over an awestruck CCSF
goalie's head. The goalie looked
as if Ik 1 were afraid to touch the
ball as it sailed into the net.
Stanford's Bob Rhodes, the
offensive star of the game, scored
with 1:20 left in the first half to
give Stan 112 or d a 2-0 edge, hut
CCSF still had time to make their
only goal of the game with sec
onds left in the half.
The second half was scoreless,
with the play of Stanford's Bob
Cormack and Hunt Bascom domi
nating the game. With 57 seconds
left in the game. Stanford applied
the clincher goal. It was Rhodes
who put the ball into the net.
, Stanford is no longer in undis
puted first place in the West
1 Coast Soccer League following a !
I 5-1 loss to City College of San'
Francisco on the winner's field j
; Saturday.
City College's win enabled them
j to slip into a three-way tie for |
first place along with California
land Stanford.
THE ABSENCE of two of Stan-!
j ford's top players from the start
ing lineup hampered the Indian
efforts. Top defensive back Jan
: Achenbach suited up but didn't
j play due to an injured ankle. Play
maker Rune Engebrettsen also,
, didn't suit up. «
Rain which fell steadily during j
the game put four-wheel brakes
j on the In d i a n s ' fast-moving ;
! attack. Instead, Stanford had to
J rely on a slow-moving p o we r
I attack, for which they are un- j
i suited.
The first quarter was a portent j
of things to come. Even without 1
scoring a goal, the Rams were
I awesome. In the first few min
j utes, the shifty Ram forwards
dominated play, having two drives
: stopped only because well-placed
shots hit the goal net supports.
THE FIRST score came with
I 10 minutes gone in the first quar
| tor on the first of CCSFer Dick
j Bowker's two goals. Dave Kings
ley made the second marker of i
the first period a few minutes
later on a 30-yard shot that caughtj
Stanford goalie Beau Bianchi out j
of position.
CCSF scored quickly again in !
the second quarter on a quick
shot by freshman centerforward j
Ai Korbus. After that. Stanford i
' toughened up considerably and I
the defense led by Bernie Knaggs, ,
Dan Farthing and Bianchi stifled!
the San Franciscans effectively!
for most of the remainder of the j
game.
City College got two quick goals
in the fourth quarter, both as a
result of momentary mental j
lapses in the backfield.
FINALLY, with two minutes I
left in the game, Stanford got
its only real chance in the game
to cheer. Emmanuel Andah. with ;
the assistance of a perfect pass
by Adam Bianchi, broke the Stan- j
ford scoring ice to make the score
