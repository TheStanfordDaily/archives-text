# Stanford Water poloists Go All Out to Trip UCLA, San Jose State by 8-7 Margins
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford's varsity water polo
squad came up with their two
greatest efforts of the season as
I hey edged UCLA,, 8 7, and San
Jose State, likewise 8-7, in action
over the weekend.
The two wins brought the Indi
anss* season record to three wins
and seven losses.
Friday against ihe Bruins, the
Indians' Boh Lorton practically
won the game by himself, pour
ing in a total of six goals.
LORTON scored the Indians'
only goal in the first period as
the two teams played to a 1-1
draw for the first seven minutes.
Stanford moved out to a 4-3
lead in the second stanza on goals
by Lorton, Bob Spence, and Rich
Rosenberger, and maintained the
one-point margin in the third pe
riod as each team scored once.
Trailing 1-5 going into the final
frame, the Bruins put on the pres
sure as they tied up the contest
on a goal by Bob Douglas.
But Lorton moved the Indians
back into the lead as he rifled
a shot past the Bruin goalie.
TIIK Mil INS, not to be out
done, then moved out in front by
a single digit on scores by Doug
las and Fickerson and seemed to
have Ihe contest wrapped up.
But the Tribe roared back as
Lorton again slipped a shot into
the Bruin goal and then lipped in
a teammate's pass for tiie win
ning goal.
Along with Lorton's outstand
ing performance, plaudits must

be given to Stanford goalie John
Bates.
In addition to his usual steady
job. Bates frustrated the Uclans
no end as he blocked shot after
shot and was instrumental in the
Indian victory.
K \TI KI>AY, the San Jose State
Spartans found a team vastly im
proved over the one they had
earlier walloped by .1 17-6 score.
The Spartans moved to a quick
2-0 lead on goals by Lon Chris
tiansen, but Stanford retorted
with scores by Spence and Lor
ton, and the first period ended
with the San Joseans holding a 3-2
margin.
Stanford asserted itself in the
second quarter, s coring three
goals to the Spartans' one, and
held a 5-4 lead which they never
relinquished.
IN Tin: TIIIKI) stanza Stan
ford moved into a seemingly in
surmountable 8-1 lead as Spence
and Lorton again lent their tal
ents to the Indian cause.
But in the last seven-minute pe
riod San Jose made a determined
assault on the Card goal, as Chris
tiansen, Roger Seail'c, and Jim
Monsees combined to score three
times and nearly a fourth but for
Indian goalie Bates' impossible
save on a Christiansen shot.
This was probably .the Tribe's
best game of the season as they
outfought and outplayed tlie Spar
tans all the way despite some
erratic passing at times.
si'KNCK topped the Indian
scorers with four goals while Lor
ton and Roger Johnson followed

with three and one respectively.
Credit should also be given to
Jack Lorton, Mike Conn. Rosen
berger, Johnson and Grant Giske.
who along with Bates, combined
to turn in outstanding games
against a tough opponent.
The frosh split a twin bill over
the weekend, defeating Carlmont
High School, 16-10, and losing to
a surprisingly to u g h San Jose
State frosh aggregation, 4-5, to
run their season's record to 6-3.
Against Carlmont, the Papooses
had it pretty much their own way
as Coach Jim Gaughran was
able to substitute freely the lull
time.
PKTK rKTTIGKKW was the
top frosh scorer with four goals.
Bill Lorton had three, and Dave
Fielding, Bob Farrell, and Don
Buehler all had two each.
Against the Spartababes, it was
Ihe Papooses who were surprised
as the San Jose team looked any
thing like Ihe squad that bowed
to the frosh by a 17-(! score in

their first meeting.
The frosh held a 1-2 lead al the
end of the first half, lnit were
held scoreless in the second while
the Span aba hes were scoring
three times to account for the
frosh's third loss this campaign.
Farrell was the leading Papoose
scorer with three markers, and
Pettigrew added one.

draw for the first seven minutes.
Stanford moved out to a 4-3
lead in the second stanza on goals
by Lorton, Bob Spence, and Rich
Rosenberger, and maintained the
one-point margin in the third pe
riod as each team scored once.
Trailing 1-5 going into the final
frame, the Bruins put on the pres
sure as they tied up the contest
on a goal by Bob Douglas.
But Lorton moved the Indians
back into the lead as he rifled
a shot past the Bruin goalie.
TIIK Mil INS, not to be out
done, then moved out in front by
a single digit on scores by Doug

have Ihe contest wrapped up.
But the Tribe roared back as
Lorton again slipped a shot into
the Bruin goal and then lipped in
a teammate's pass for tiie win
ning goal.
Along with Lorton's outstand
ing performance, plaudits must

be given to Stanford goalie John
Bates.
In addition to his usual steady
job. Bates frustrated the Uclans
no end as he blocked shot after
shot and was instrumental in the
Indian victory.

margin.
Stanford asserted itself in the
second quarter, s coring three
goals to the Spartans' one, and
held a 5-4 lead which they never
relinquished.

But in the last seven-minute pe
riod San Jose made a determined
assault on the Card goal, as Chris
tiansen, Roger Seail'c, and Jim
Monsees combined to score three
times and nearly a fourth but for
Indian goalie Bates' impossible
save on a Christiansen shot.
This was probably .the Tribe's
best game of the season as they
