# Pauling Vies With Nixon, Kennedy in Straw Vote
## 
### 
A campus straw vote for presi
dent will be held tomorrow by
Political Union. The straw vote
was designed to let Stanford stu
dents and faculty indicate their
president ial preferences.
Besides Nixon and Kennedy,
the name of Dr. Linus Pauling,
famed but controversial physicist,
will appear on the ballot. A space
will also be provided to allow
write-in votes for serious politi
cal figures.
Pauling's name qualified for
the straw ballot when a petition
signed by 50 students was turned
in supporting his candidacy. The
stated aim of the petition was "to
provide an opportunity for a pro
test vote for those who feel that
neither of the major candidates
presents a strong enough plat
form on disarmament or civil
rights."
Pauling has recent ly been under
fire from the Senate Internal Se
curity Committee for refusing to
name fellow backers of a petition
for nuclear disarmament.
Polls will be open tomorrow
between 8:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. at
Engineering Come r, the post
office and in front of the main
library.
