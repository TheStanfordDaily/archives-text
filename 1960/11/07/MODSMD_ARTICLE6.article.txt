# Nixon Takes Battle to Alaska; Kennedy Mops Up in New York
## Senator Ends Campaign for New York Vote 
### 
( UPI i Sen. John F. Kennedy
carried his campaign down to the
wire yesterday in a series of huge
campaign extravaganzas in Con
necticut, New York State and New
Jersey.
A throng estimated by Hudson
County police chief Fred Kropke
at 65,000 j a mm e d into Jersey
City's Journal Square to hear the
Democratic presidential candidate
press his attack against Vice
President Richard M. Nixon and
to reaffirm his own pledges for
the future if elected President.
THIS WAS his third New Jer
sey stop, following appearances
before many other thousands at
Newark and Teaneck. He flew
into the state after telling some
10,000 persons at a rally in Corn
mack, in traditionally Republican
Suffolk County, New York, that
if he is elected he will work until
"a college education is available
to every young man and woman
with the talent to pursue it."
Earlier, Kennedy addressed tens
of thousands of persons at New
Haven and Bridgeport, Conn.,
where he began the theme that
lie sounded throughout the day
that Nixon had been misleading
the American people in maintain
ing that America's economy, pres
tige. and military power are at
a peak.
KENNEDY kept insisting that
Nixon's claims had been "proven
untrue" and that a Democratic
administration is needed to get
the country moving again in those
vital fields.
The size of the Jersey City
crowd was considered by many
newsmen to have been overesti
mated—but it was at least in the
range of 25,000 or 30,000 and
police said it had been many times
larger before Kennedy's arrival,
which was almost three hours
later.
Kennedy told the crowd at Com
mack that the federal government
should mass produce education in
this country by establishing thou
sands of scholarships for needy
and qualified students.
"We pledge ourselves to seek
a system of higher education
where every young American can
lie educated not according to his
race or his means but according
to his capacity," Kennedy said.
lIE PROPOSED a three-point
program including "federal schol
arships for a limited number of
needy and qualified students
perhaps 15,000 to 25,000 initially."

Earlier, Kennedy addressed tens
of thousands of persons at New
Haven and Bridgeport, Conn.,
where he began the theme that
lie sounded throughout the day
that Nixon had been misleading
the American people in maintain
ing that America's economy, pres
tige. and military power are at
a peak.
KENNEDY kept insisting that
Nixon's claims had been "proven
untrue" and that a Democratic
administration is needed to get
the country moving again in those
vital fields.
The size of the Jersey City
crowd was considered by many
newsmen to have been overesti
mated—but it was at least in the
range of 25,000 or 30,000 and
police said it had been many times
larger before Kennedy's arrival,
which was almost three hours
later.
Kennedy told the crowd at Com
mack that the federal government
should mass produce education in
this country by establishing thou
sands of scholarships for needy
and qualified students.
"We pledge ourselves to seek
a system of higher education
where every young American can
lie educated not according to his
race or his means but according
to his capacity," Kennedy said.
lIE PROPOSED a three-point
program including "federal schol
arships for a limited number of
needy and qualified students
perhaps 15,000 to 25,000 initially."
