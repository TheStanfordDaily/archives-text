LOS ANGELES (UPI) — Vice
President Richard M. Nixon said
last night that if elected he would
send President Eisenhower and
former Presidents Hoover and
Truman on a visit to all iron
curtain nations next year pro
vided the Soviets issue an invita
tion.
Nixon laid a direct challenge
to the Soviets to extend the invi
tation and said Eisenhower
already "assures me that ho is
more than ready to carry the
torch of freedom on such a jour
ney."
THE GOP presidential nominee
said Eisenhower suggested that
Hoover and Truman be invited
to join him and"I fully agree."
"If they are willing I would
extend my warmest invitation to
them to join President Eisenhow
er in his crusade," Nixon said.
Nixon also declared that "there
is no religious issue in this cam
paign" and said "you should vote
for neither me nor (Kennedy) in
the basis of the religious issue.'
Nixon said he and Kennedy
"differ so far as faith is con
cerned. but we both have faith in
God . . . there would be a legiti
mate religious issue only if one
of the candidates had no religion."
Nixon made the statements in
remarks prepared for a half hour
nationwide telecast w hi c h was
broadcast as he flew to Alaska to
visit his 50th state of the cam
paign on the first lap of a non
stop 36-hour campaign stretch
windup.
Nixon's aides said the Vice
President regarded the telecast as
one of the most important half
hours of the campaign. Nixon said
Khrushchev blamed the ill-fated
U2 flight for cancelling the invi
tation to the President to visit
Russia this year but actually "he
wanted to prevent the President
from exerting the pull of free
dom on the Soviet people by his
presence and uncensored words.
Khrushchev wanted no popular
demonstration which the Presi
dent would have received —- of
friendship for America."
IF ELECTED, Nixon told his
nationwide TV audience, he would
"welcome (Khrushchev's) chal
lenge to peaceful competition of
our system" and "let us carry
the challenge to him. Long
enough he has talked of competi
tion from behind the privileged
sanctuary of his iron curtain."
Nixon said he felt Eisenhower,
Hoover and Truman "are unique
ly qualified to carry our message
of good will and state the case
for peace and freedom behind the
iron curtain."
In a broader appeal to all the
world, Nixon said:
"We are not concerned with the
type of government that you
freely choose for yourselves. We
are concerned only when you have
no freedom of choice."
