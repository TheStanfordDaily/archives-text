# Stanford's Spirit Need Not Be Limited to Athletic Activities
## 
### FRANCES FISHER 
"This year looks like it will be a year for big
strides in spirit at Stanford, but hopefully the spirit
will not be limited to athletic activities," states Bob
Linneman, chairman of ihe Fundamental Standard
Committee.
"The spirit shown here at the USC game is an
example of the strength of spirit this school can
exhibit. A similar spirit must be applyed to the
Honor Code if this system is to be effective. We
arc not looking for the 'red-hot' aspect of the en
thusiasm, but rather the strength which it ex
hibits. We need a serious yet enthusiastic attitude
toward the Honor Code." Linneman asserts.
A STANFORD professor who was an undergrad
uate when the Honor Code was first instituted at
Stanford has compared the spirit shown at the game
with the feeling of the student body toward the
Honor Code during his undergraduate years. He
says that the type of spirit that encourages students
to ostracize anyone who throws a water balloon
and that encourages a freshman to stand up and
say what he thinks at a rally is wry similar to the
kind of spirit that founded the Honor Code here.
When the Honor Code was new to Stanford, any
violator would have literally been tarred and feath
erod and there was no need for Judicial Council,
this professor states.
IJXNE.MAN, along with many students and fac
ulty members, feels that such an attitude toward
the Honor Code does not now exist. "But it can exist
and must exist if the Code is to work and recre
ating the founding spirit of the Honor Code is ihe
challenge which we are presenting to the student
body this year."
As part of his campaign to improve the student's
attitudes toward the Honor Code, Linneman would

like every student first to recognize the fact that
a problem dons exist concerning the Code and then
to be willing to do something about it.
"WE NEED more people who are willing to
stand up for what they know is right," Linneman
stresses. He says that two altitudes are prevelant
which, if they continue to exist, will destroy the
Honor Code System. The first is the feeling that the
Honor Code is a joke, thai it is a nice, but unreal
istic ideal. The second i* the concept that people
who take their "third person responsibility" seri
ously ait? tat I let ales.
Concerning the problem of third person respon
sibility, Linneman would like every student to rea
lize that the Honor Code states that if any student
sees or knows about a violation, he should take ac
tion appropriate to the situation. Appropriate
actions can include tapping your pcncil when seeing
a violation during an exam, telling someone plan
ning on cheating that you know of his plans and
will report him it' he carries them out, or suggesting
to someone who has cheated that they not turn in
their exam.
"THE IMPORTANT duty is not to inform on
someone, but to prevent the violation from occuring
in the first place," Linneman emphasizes.
"The Committee is well aware of just how dif
ficult this third person responsibility is. It is not
always easy to express your opinions, especially
when you feel you are in the minority. There is
seldom glory in standing up for what is right, but
it is something which must be done by every in
dividual."
Linneman hopes that by the end of this year
everyone will know that standing up for the Honor
Code is an action supported by all his fellow stu
dents. and thus it should be much less difficult to
help prevent violations of the Code.
