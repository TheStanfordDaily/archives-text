### 
Stanford lias received $225,000
from the National Science Foun
dation to refurbish and expand
facilities at the University's Hop
kins Marine Station in Pacific
Grove, il was announced yester

Professor Lawrence R. Blinks,
station director, said William D.
Concolino of Monterey has been

Construction will begin soon
after plans are drawn. It is hoped
the new facilities will be ready by
next fall.
ALL but $50,000 will go into a
"Marinostat" building adjacent to
the station's Jacques Loeb Labo
ratory. It will contain additional
laboratories and aquaria in

will include compressors for re
frigerating sea water.
The unique Marinostat appara
tus will enable station scientists
to control conditions of tempera
ture. light, and salinity. Sea-water
tanks will permit study of marine
specimens in a laboratory envi
ronment over longer periods of j
time.
Other new facilities will include
a m a line greenhouse, several j
shallow outdoor pools and addi- j
tional sea-water storage tanks.

stallation of new pipes, lighting,
floors, and ceilings, plus painting,
fireproofing and waterproofing.
