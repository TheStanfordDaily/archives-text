# Daily Plans Election Edition
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily's six-page
election issue tomorrow morning
will provide Stanford residents
with the most complete coverage
of national, state and local elec
tion returns available on campus.
In addition to the facilities of
the top national wire of United
Press International, 25 Daily staf
fers will be on duty from 3 p.m.
on at the Daily Shack.
ONLY WHEN one candidate
has conceded defeat, or if the
voting is too close to determine a
winner tonight, will the issue be
locked up. This means the Daily
can wait as late as 3 a.m. <6 a.m.
EST> before beginning its press
run. Besides running stories on
the Senate. House, presidency and
governorship races, the Daily
also will carry results on the 15
California propositions and re
turns from local contests in Santa
Clara and San Mateo counties.
AS A SPECIAL service to those
on campus. The Daily will give
returns from hte national election
starting at 5 p.m. The number to
call is DA 2-2166. Do NOT call
DA 2-6168, the incorrect number
listed in yesterday's paper.
