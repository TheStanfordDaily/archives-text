# Foothill Zoning Plan on Paly Ballot Today
## 
### 
Palo Alto voters today will de
termine the fato of the bitterly
contested Stanford foothills zon
ing proposal.
The issue concerns whether 254
acres of foothills land owned by
the University should be rezoned
and annexed to Palo Alto for light
industrial development, including
a manufacturing and research
center by Ainpex Corp.
The matter has been the sub
ject of much heated debate since
the Palo Alto City Council last
July decided to let the voters de
cide if the land should be added
to Stanford's Industrial Park, an
area of light industrial and re
search firms located on Univer
sity land south of Escondido Vil
lage off El Camino Real.
Opponents of the proposal say
the proposed development would
mar forever the beauty of the
rolling foothills surrounding the
campus and the local area.
The University and other back
ers of the plan say that stringent
rules would be applied 1o any
company moving into the area to
insure that the natural setting of
the area would not be wrecked.
One notable voicing his disap
proval of the rezoning this week
was Leland Stanford III. grand
nephew of Gov. Leland Stanford.
"I CANNOT stand by," said
Stanford, "and see the beloved
scenes of my boyhood despoiled
without raising my voice in pro
test."
Also earlier this week, M. H.
L. Sanders, the University's direc
tor of planning, pointed out that
Stanford's Board of Trustees, fac
ulty, administration and its Presi
dent's Faculty Committee on
Land and Building Development
have proved on countless occa
sions that Stanford values highly
the aesthetic qualities of its land
and of its landscape.
