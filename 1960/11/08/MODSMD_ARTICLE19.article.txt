# Gross Superficiality
## 
### 
During tHis loii}! and sometimes bitter campaign, Senator Ken
nedy lias been accused by the Republicans of being a pessimist
and a negative thinker. Whether this is true or not, and whether
it should have any bearing on tlie elections will be decided by the
voters today.
However, if Senator Kennedy is guilty of the above assertion,
then the same may be said for Mr. Nixon.
Yesterday, the Daily discussed Senator Kennedy's proposal for
a "Peace Corps," a concept Ave deem most important. Over the
week end Mr. Nixon called this Corps "an inherently dangerous'"
program that would encourage draft dodgers.
He went on to say that the program "is superficial and obviously
concocted solely for campaign purposes. If put into effect it would
be harmful to both the Selective Service and to those so ably
representative of the United States abroad."
He said the program would onlv be bait for so-called "volun
teers" who "in truth"" would be trying to escape tlie draft.
This is one of the finest examples of negative thinking to emerge
from the campaign. Besides, the only thing "superficial" is Mr.
Nixon's reasons for opposition to the Peace Corps.
How could this Corps possibly be harmful to the Selective
Draft? There are thousands upon thousands of young men who
simply could not qualify for this Corps. The Selective Draft would
still have plenty to choose from.
Secondly, would Mr. Nixon deny that many men who are
drafted are simply wasting their time learning how to tight with
weapons when their best weapon is their minds?
Mr. Nixon has said time and time again that he wants to keep
America strong. Would he then deny that this Peace Corps will
undoubtedly help America remain strong, by fighting Communist
ideology ?
Mr. Nixon's comment about the Corps hurting those "so ably
representative of the United States abroad*' is another example of
superficiality. It is true that we have able representatives abroad,
but we don't have enough! The Communists have more able rep
resentatives and in more places. Contrary to Mr. Nixon's statement,
this Peace Corps could supplement, rather than hinder the efforts
of our present representatives.
And now we come to the epitome of negative thinking. Mr.
Nixon thinks that the Peace Corps would be a haven for draft
dodgers. Did it ever cross Mr. Nixon's mind that there might actu
ally be some young men in this country who think that they could
render their country a greater service by sening in such a Corps
rather than by trotting around foreign soil with gun in hand?
And doesn't Mr. Nixon realize that draft dodgers could easily
be ferreted out by a battery of tests that could determine a per
son's sincerity and capability? It is important to remember that
Mr. Kennedy's proposal does not apply to all young men and
women. It applies only to those people who prove themselves
qualified for the very difficult task.
The words "draft dodger" take on a completely new, positive
meaning in regard to the Peace Corps. It is true that these talented
men would be "dodging" the draft, but for a constructive purpose.
With th ese things in mind, we shall completely ignore Mr.
Nixon's statements and once again wholeheartedly endorse Mr.
Kennedy's proposal.

Mr. Nixon has said time and time again that he wants to keep
America strong. Would he then deny that this Peace Corps will
undoubtedly help America remain strong, by fighting Communist
ideology ?
Mr. Nixon's comment about the Corps hurting those "so ably
representative of the United States abroad*' is another example of
superficiality. It is true that we have able representatives abroad,
but we don't have enough! The Communists have more able rep
resentatives and in more places. Contrary to Mr. Nixon's statement,
this Peace Corps could supplement, rather than hinder the efforts
of our present representatives.
And now we come to the epitome of negative thinking. Mr.
Nixon thinks that the Peace Corps would be a haven for draft
dodgers. Did it ever cross Mr. Nixon's mind that there might actu
ally be some young men in this country who think that they could
render their country a greater service by sening in such a Corps
rather than by trotting around foreign soil with gun in hand?
And doesn't Mr. Nixon realize that draft dodgers could easily
be ferreted out by a battery of tests that could determine a per
son's sincerity and capability? It is important to remember that
Mr. Kennedy's proposal does not apply to all young men and
women. It applies only to those people who prove themselves
qualified for the very difficult task.
The words "draft dodger" take on a completely new, positive
meaning in regard to the Peace Corps. It is true that these talented
men would be "dodging" the draft, but for a constructive purpose.
With th ese things in mind, we shall completely ignore Mr.
Nixon's statements and once again wholeheartedly endorse Mr.
Kennedy's proposal.
During tHis loii}! and sometimes bitter campaign, Senator Ken
nedy lias been accused by the Republicans of being a pessimist
and a negative thinker. Whether this is true or not, and whether
it should have any bearing on tlie elections will be decided by the
voters today.
However, if Senator Kennedy is guilty of the above assertion,
then the same may be said for Mr. Nixon.
Yesterday, the Daily discussed Senator Kennedy's proposal for
a "Peace Corps," a concept Ave deem most important. Over the
week end Mr. Nixon called this Corps "an inherently dangerous'"
program that would encourage draft dodgers.
He went on to say that the program "is superficial and obviously
concocted solely for campaign purposes. If put into effect it would
be harmful to both the Selective Service and to those so ably
representative of the United States abroad."
He said the program would onlv be bait for so-called "volun
teers" who "in truth"" would be trying to escape tlie draft.
This is one of the finest examples of negative thinking to emerge
from the campaign. Besides, the only thing "superficial" is Mr.
Nixon's reasons for opposition to the Peace Corps.
How could this Corps possibly be harmful to the Selective
Draft? There are thousands upon thousands of young men who
simply could not qualify for this Corps. The Selective Draft would
still have plenty to choose from.
Secondly, would Mr. Nixon deny that many men who are
drafted are simply wasting their time learning how to tight with
weapons when their best weapon is their minds?
