## Students for Nixon 
### 
Returns are coming in from
campus mock elections across the
nation, and Vice President Rich
ard M. Nixon has taken a com
manding lead.
Out of 16 colleges reporting,
Nixon has won twelve, Kennedy
four.
Nixon piled up large pluralities
in the Midwest, where he swept
seven schools of the Big 10. The
other three were not voting.
Senator Kennedy's four victor
ies were scattered across the na
tion at Fordham University in
New York City, Amherst in Mas
sachusetts, the University of Wi
chita in Kansas, and St. Cloud
State College in Minnesota, where
the vote was 547-538.
The results of the Big 10 poll
showed:
Northwestern: Nixon, 2,032;
Kennedy, 1,058
Ohio State: Nixon, 4,055; Ken
nedy. 2,303
University of Michigan: Nixon,
2,372; Kennedy, 2,048
University of Illinois: Nixon,
3,926; Kennedy, 3,519
University of Indiana: Nixon,
2,761; Kennedy, 1,660
University of Iowa: Nixon,
1,948; Kennedy, 1,413
University of Wisconsin: Nixon,
3,940; Kennedy, 3,057
Turnout in the Big 10 ranged
from 19 percent at Michigan to
37 percent at Wisconsin, consid
erably larger than student body
elections.
Besides his sweep of the Big
10, Nixon won handily at the Uni
versity of Washington, Washing
toil State College, the University
of South Carolina, and Alfred Uni
versity. At the Washington
schools, Nixon held a 2-1 margin.
Nixon also eked out a close

victory at Cornell University in
up-state New York, where the
vote was 1,595 to 1,503. Two hun
dred and sixteen Democrats voted
for Adlai Stevenson, robbing Ken
nedy of a campus victory.
It is open to question how cam
pus results should be interpreted.
They may be discounted as re
flecting typical middle class and
upper middle class attitudes, for
it is this segment of American
society that sends most students
to college.
Or the results can be interpret
ed as a resurgence of conserva
tism which has come about to
combat the liberal ideas that have
held sway on most American cam
puses since the early days of
FDR.

As election tension has mounted
during the last few weeks, it has
been vented in several humorous
| incidents.
A women's dormitory window
at the University of Minnesota
was completely filled with a pic
ture of Senator Hubert Humph
rey. Under it was a caption read
ing like an advertisement: "This
room is heated by hot air."
Also from Minnesota comes the
news that the Students for Ken
nedy Club at its last meeting
endorsed Vice President Nixon
for president.
It seems that Kennedy fans
showed up in such a small num
ber that a large group of enter
prising Republicans were able to
wrestle away the chairmanship
of the club and introduce a reso
lution that the organization en
dorse Nixon.
The outraged minority walked
out and the resolution was ac
cepted unanimously.
