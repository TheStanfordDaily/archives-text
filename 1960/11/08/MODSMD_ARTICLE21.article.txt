# United States Policy in Africa

### PETER DUIGNAN 
(Editor's Note: This is the last
of two articles by Peter Duignan,
curator of the Africa Collection
in the Hoover Institute. Yester
day, Duignan developed his thesis
that perhaps it would not he too
wise for tlie Western powers to
sever their ties with colonial pow
ers, as certain people such as
Bowles and Herskovitz have sug
gested.)

The outlook for Ihe new Afri
can states is not a cheerful one.
In the last century, British liber
als used to back small nations
struggling to be free. Gladstone's
policy of supporting the Christian
Balkan nationalities against their
Ottoman overlords made some
sense, not merely for religious
and economic reasons, but also
for military ones.
At that time, the main weight
of warfare fell on the infantry;
and, by and large, a Bulgarian
division in the 1870's was about
as good as a Russian or an Aus
trian division; the new Balkan
states, therefore, had some chance
of defending themselves.
After the First World War, the
industrialization of warfare made
the peasant armies largely obso
lete, and by 1940, a Balkan divi
sion was no longer the equivalent
of a German one. The latest de
velopments of military science
have changed the military situa
tion further still; only large con
tinental blocks can now wage
wars "successfully"; from the
military point of view, the new
"Bandung" states are already as
obsolete as the air-squadrons with
which they now hurriedly equip
themselves.
There cannot, therefore, be any
simple rule of thumb for the con
duct of United States foreign pol
icy in Africa. What is needed is
flexibility, realism and, above all,
avoidance of the view that Ameri
can policy must somehow or other
be ideologically gleichgeschaltet.
Israel, for instance, enjoys per
fectly amicable relations with
Ghana and South Africa alike.
The Soviet Union supports a
"feudalist" regime in Afghani
stan, an emergent "national bour
geoisie" in Egypt, and a party
bureaucracy in Albania.
What matters in the long run
is not only theory, it is also pow
er. As Mr. Nehru put it, "ideologi
cal urges play some part . . . but
in the final analysis foreign poli
cy chiefly concerns itself with the
national interest." To base for
eign policy on some kind of lib
eral "loyalty test" will not serve
United States interest s—and
neither will it lead to the results
expected by Bowles, Herskovitz
and Apter.
Political and economic warfare
against the Nationalists in South
A 112 r i c a, to take a concrete ex
ample, would not "liberalize" the
Union, and a boycott would not
be any more effective than those
against Fascist Italy or Commu
nist China. It would simply drive
the Nationalist regime into the
Neutralist camp on the basis of
"mutual respect of one another's
social systems," confirm them in
a self sufficient isolationism, and
deprive the NATO states of one
of their most vital strategic posi
tions.
United States support of the
Algerian nationalities, to cite an
other instance, would not neces
sarily create a democratic Algeria.
But it might lead to a crushing
French military defeat, and saddle

France with a beaten and muti
nous army of 400,000 men and
1,000,000 refugees which could
result in a Fascist regime in
Paris, the breakup of NATO, and
the probable expulsion of the sub
stantial Algerian minority in
France.
To brush aside such considera
tions does not constitute political
idealism, it simply shows an ab
sence of good sense. For, let it
be stressed once more, the rela
tions between states, including
those between Eastern, Western,
and Neutralist ones, are not gov
erned by the laws of some imagi
nary Smithian political market
economy, where states buy their
ideological and political require
ments in the cheapest market, and
sell their services in tlie dearest.
Foreign policy is subject to con
siderations much more complex
than these, and the West cannot
afford to ignore them.
What can the United States do?
Relatively little, apart from pro
viding capital and technical help.
As far as practical solutions to
political problems are concerned,
United States advice can only be
limited. Self-determination is not
a cure-all — especially in Africa
where self-determination for each
and every ethnic group would lead
to chaos.
The end of colonialism has
already fragmented the former
European empires, instea <1 of
French Equatorial Africa we now
have Gabon, Chad, the Central
African Republic and the Repub
lic of the Congo. The result —a
lot of little states without any
real justification for independ
ence. This multiplication of states
unrealistically inflates their value
—each one gets a vote in the U.N.
Herein lies a danger. The big
powers will in the long run be
even more adverse to being ruled
by majorities made up of Nicara
gua, Gambia, and Zambia, than
they were in the past. This could
conceivably wreck the U.N., be
sides it is an impossible situation.
If Germany were to split up
into its pre-1870 units, it could
rule the United Nations for it
would have 36 votes. Or the U.S.
could insist that it have 50 seats
in the assembly. Then, of course,
the Soviet Union would follow
suit—after all, Lithuania and the
Ukraine or Georgia are more rea
sonable units than Upper Volta
why not a scat for Lower Volta as
well?
Neither can the dream of a
United States of Africa be re
garded as pr a c t i c a b 1 e. The
achievement of Union in Western
Europe with its much greater cul

j tural, geographical, and histori
cal unity is proving difficult
enough. How much harder will
it be to unite a continent so vast
and varied as Africa, which pos
sesses few common traditions, no
common system of roads and rail
ways, few seaports, few navigable
rivers, and where communications
are blocked by deserts, forests,
and mountains.
Ethiopia is already being weak
ened by the separation of the S<>-
! nialis and other groups; the
attempt to create an independent
state of Uganda is meeting re
sistance because of the fear of
Uuganda imperialism; and the
Belgian Congo, soon after achiev
ing its independence, is in danger
of breaking up into several parts.
The greatest problem facing the
; new Africa is not imperialism, it
lis Balkanization, chaos, the re
-1 vival of tribalism, and the rule
i of caudillos. This is what a cau
| tious and empirical United States
! policy should try to prevent—for
| the penalty of failure would be
disaster for Africa and for the
I entire West.
