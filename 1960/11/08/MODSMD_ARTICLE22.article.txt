Kditor, the Daily:
Being a follower of the Uni
versity of Southern California
athletic teams and school, 1 have
had the opportunity over the last
ten years to attend the Stanford-
USC football games at Palo Alto.
Two years ago I sat in the Stan
xord alumni section, with a very
close friend of mine, and a very
true Stanford rooter. At that time
we and our wives were very per
turbed at the lack of rooter loy
ally and courtesy. Above all we
were dismayed to think that the
cheer leaders had no control over
| the Stanford rooting section. They
| apparently seemed to be figure
I heads rather than an important
i facet of the student and team
i leadership.
I This year we sat on the oppo
site side of the field, not localise
! it was shady, but because we did
not want to be traumatized once
again. But, I must confess that
it would have been an honor once
again to sit on the Stanford side
of the field. 1 am sure that not
| only the students, but the cheer
j leaders, the entire Stanford alum
j ni and faculty can be proud as
i was I, a Southern California alum
nus, of the wonderful attitude,
i I hope that this is not a one
game spirit, but that it will con
tinue throughout the years to
come.
