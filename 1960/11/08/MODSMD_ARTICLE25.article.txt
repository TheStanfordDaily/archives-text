# U.S. Students Abroad

### MAYHAR NASHAT 
The Daily's editorial concerning
the urgent need for compulsory
courses of Marxism-Leninism in
American universities, anticipated
the writing of this article which
I had in mind since I came to
Stanford.
During many years of experi
ence both as a foreign •student and
corresp on d en t abroad and
through university activities, I
have had the opportunity to ob
serve the attitude of the American
students in some Middle East and
European countries.
Since America lias assumed the
leadership against Communist po
litical-psychological warfare, I be
lieve it is the duty of all Ameri
cans to contribute to the cause of
Democracy and freedom by can
did observations of common
interest. It is in that spirit that
I write these few lines.

The first remark on the Ameri
can student abroad is that he is
not fully informed on the great
issues in his country. He cannot
give satisfactory explanations on
subjects which are related to
every day events. He continues in
the same "local" way of thinking
which he developed while residing
in the U.S.
He is not fully aware that na
tionals in foreign countries look
upon him as the citizen of a coun
try which, using Walter Lipp
mann's words, is ". . . no longer
one among many great powers
but that in fact is the leading
power upon which the whole
Western world depends for its
security and for leadership."
Ho does not realize that other
people are interested not only in
the particular region or state
from which he comes, but con
sidering him an American—the
entire United States. He may be
interrogated on subjects ranging
from oil production and racial dis
crimination. to red-Indians and
folklore traditions.
Now thai I am at Stanford and
can see the rich and colorful vari
ety of campus activities, I wonder
why these same individuals he
conic different in the foreign uni
versities. They should show more
interest in organizing - discussion
panels on different aspects of life
in their country, and should seek
a better comprehension of the
foreign societies.
The second remark, closely re
lated to the first, is that the Amer
ican student is not well informed
on his country's foreign policy, its
principles and its objectives. He
is unable to defend the basic doc
trines of a free society, such as
his.
This "lag" is more striking if
he argues with a Communist.
Whether a Communist defends his

; point of view because of brain
washing, true conviction or spe
cial training, the answer is of
j little importance as long as world
i communism exploits this excel
lent medium of human contact
and propaganda in foreign lands,
j If a Communist does not convince
his interlocutor, he may at least
impress him by his apparent be
lief, en t husia s t i c tone and
i vehemence.
When we agree that the Amer
ican student has a double respon
sibility toward his motherland
i (as a citizeni, and toward the free
world (led by his country) -we
| admit that it is of utmost impor
! lance that he should be armed
•spiritually and intellectually
against I lie rival's challenge.
The first step, and here I join
the Daily's viewpoint, is to ex
plain to all American students the
basic theories of Marxism-Lenin
ism, its applications and the pres
ent status of the Communist
countries.
He must understand and defend
wholeheartedly the d e 112 in i t i on
which his Founding Fathers have
given him as his national goal:
". . . to form a more perfect union,
establish justice, insure domestic
tranquility, provide for the com
mon defense, promote the gen
eral welfare and secure blessings
of liberty."
He must be reminded that a
third of the world's population;
Asia. Africa and South America,
is now passing through the rudi
mentary phases of development,
They will choose the tools by
which they endeavor to achieve
their goals. Their decision will be
decisive in determining the power
between West and East.
The third remark is that the
American student is not well in
formed on the foreign country to
which he is going. He must re
ceive more thorough information
on diverse aspects concerning the
people, the language, their na
tional traditions and aspirations.
The present program of train
ing carried out by some of the
American universities for their
students abroad is an encouraging
sign, yet insufficient and ineffec
tive. The training must be com
pulsory, rejecting such idealistic
arguments as "interference with
individual freedom."
As George F. Ken nan said: "A I
nation which excuses its own fail- j
ures by the sacred untouchable- |
ness of its own habits can excuse :
itself into complete disaster."
