Editor, tin- Daily:
An article appeared in the Daily
last Friday, Nov. 4, 1960, entitled
"Rooters' Integration Proposed at
LASSU." 1 would like to voice my
intense disapproval of any such
policy.
1 realize that many will jump
to the conclusion, merely because
I am a segregationist, that I do
not like women. I do not, in fact,
dislike 1 women, and I am not
afraid to say t hat 1 have known
some whom 1 would number
among my closest friends. This
does jt mean, however, that 1
think they are as good as the rest
of us. This is one reason, then,
that they should not be seated
with us they are just not our
Social Equals.
Chief Justice Warren once said,
"Today education is a principal
instrument in awakening the stu
dent to cultural values . . . and in
helping him to adjust to a normal
environment." (See "A South
erner Looks at the Supreme
Court," Saturday Review for Oct.
9, 1951.) Now, here at Stanford
the normal environment of males
is in the male rooting section, and
the normal environment of fe
males is in the female rooting sec
tion. and a mixed rooting section
would not help a student of either
sex to adjust to his normal en

vironment. Thus in the interest
of furthering the cause of educa
tion we must i-etain segregation
of rooting sections.
Another reason to retain this
segregation is that we were ob
viously just Not Meant to have
mixed rooting sections. If God
had wanted mixed rooting sec
tions he would have made them
so.
Thus, to avert the chaos of in
discriminate social Togetherness,
to advance Education, and to act
as God intended, we must main
tain the status quo of segregation,
and provide for out women sep
arate but equal rooting sections.

instrument in awakening the stu
dent to cultural values . . . and in
helping him to adjust to a normal
environment." (See "A South
erner Looks at the Supreme
Court," Saturday Review for Oct.
9, 1951.) Now, here at Stanford
the normal environment of males
is in the male rooting section, and
the normal environment of fe
males is in the female rooting sec
tion. and a mixed rooting section
would not help a student of either
sex to adjust to his normal en

vironment. Thus in the interest
of furthering the cause of educa
tion we must i-etain segregation
of rooting sections.
Another reason to retain this
segregation is that we were ob
viously just Not Meant to have
mixed rooting sections. If God
had wanted mixed rooting sec
tions he would have made them
so.
Thus, to avert the chaos of in
discriminate social Togetherness,
to advance Education, and to act
as God intended, we must main
tain the status quo of segregation,
and provide for out women sep
arate but equal rooting sections.
