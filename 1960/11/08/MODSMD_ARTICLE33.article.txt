rides and child care to encourage voting.
The group has spent the past week telephoning all registered
Republicans, Democrats for Nixon, and undecided persons to en
courage them to vote today.
The organization, which will dissolve after the election, was
formed to get out the Republican vote and to "give Stanford students
the opportunity to work in the election." It has been working with
the Young Republicans and Republican headquarters.
After the election tonight, the group, with their basset! hound
mascot. Mr. GOP, will hold a party to watch the election results.
