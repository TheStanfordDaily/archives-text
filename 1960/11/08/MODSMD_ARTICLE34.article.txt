# Even Chessmen Plan to Defeat Cal Opponents
## 
### 
"We're pretty confident of beat
ing Cal," chess team organizer
Hex Wilcox said yesterday after
his group sent rivals from San
Jose State down to resounding de-
I feat on the chess board, Pa to 'j,
' on Monday.
The score represents four wins
| and one draw in the five matches
; played, Wilcox explained. Robert
j Lorber, William Rogers, Ed Bo
] gas, and Ben Carter vanquished
their Spartan opponents, and
sophomore John Mori/ came up
with a tie. Wilcox, one of Stan
ford's lop players, was unable to
compete.
This was the first intercollegi
ate match the group has arranged,
said Wilcox, but he is working
on competition with Cal as soon
as possible. Teams from other
■ area colleges may prove to be
mere pawns of the S t a n 112 o rd
groups, Wilcox intimated. Lorber
is king of the Stanford castle,
I having attained the "Chess Mas
ter" rating of the Pnited States
j Chess Federation. Wilcox is a
"Chess Expert' and Mortz is
nearly at that level. All of the
six Stanford players are rated
"Class A" players, said Wilcox.
Wilcox called the Stanford
group "undoubtedly one of the
strongest in the country," re
marking that it's "too bad" it
can't compete in the annual inter
collegiate matches held in the mid-
West and East because of dis
tance and expense involved. "We'd
have a good chance of winning,"
I he said.
