Will We Win One?
ANOTHER WEICKKNI), another loss. With only two more games
to go Stanford is looking at the second season without a win in our
football history. The last time this terrible thing happened was back
in 1947 which saw the team lose to Idaho. Michigan, Santa Clara,
UCLA, Washington. OSC, SC, Oregon and finally Cal in the Big Game.
The last game Stanford won was against the OSC Beavers
last year in Corvallis and if the Orange and Black men can reverse
the proceedings this weekend and they are favored to do so the
Indians will only have one to go for a complete losing season.
The big question in aSturday's game is whether the players them
selves feel they can win. Traveling to and from the Oregon game
this writer wondered where their confidence was. Perhaps one rea
son for no apparent show of confidence is the defeat-minded pub
licity the team has been receiving in area papers and by word of
mouth around the Bay. It certainly can't be attributed entirely to
the student body. For during the SC game a most unusual event
occurred. Inspired by a pre-game rally and led pretty much by the

freshmen class, the rooting sec
tion really bounced the yells back
from across the way in a clear
showing of support behind the
team and the coaching staff.
GRANTED THE rooting sec
tion couldn't go North for the
game and probably the team was
a little flat after two Ilerculian
struggles against the two South
ern California teams- SC and
UCLA but there was still no
great showing of confidence be
fore the Oregon game. Afterwards
there was a definite subdued
feeling on the way home. One
player joked feebly and wondered
if the student body would hang
the team in effigy this weekend
after their poor showing up North.
Certainly the team wants to
win—and very badly. The teams
they have played have been faster
usually, but on a man to man

basis they have not been that much better. The coaching staff has
been doing all in their power to win. They also want to win very
badly. For no matter how much the Stanford football fan is critical
about Coach Jack Curtice's results they can't criticize his efforts.
THE TEAM IS DEFINITELY handicapped by a lack of speed
in the backfield. This was evident in last Saturday's game with the
Oregon Webfoots—where quarterback Dave Groz could pass with
comparative ease to his fleet halfbacks Dave Grayson or Cleveland
Jones or his ends Len Burnett and Jerry Tarr.
Also Stanford is lacking the quality of receivers who caught
Dick Norman's tosses last season. Certainly Mac Wylie and Skip
Face have grabbed off a few but Curtice has been unable to de
velop an end who can consistently catch the crucial passes which
Chris Burford, Ben Robinson or Irv Nikolai could do last season.
These two facts have pretty well stifled Stanford's passing offense—
for Norman does not want to throw as often this year as last to re
ceivers who seem to drop many passes and the lack of speed has
definitely hurt the pass defense.
ANY TEAM THAT WANTS to pass against the Indians can—
with speedy deceptive receivers who can get in the open nine times
out of ten.
The Cycle Swings Down
But before we become too highly critical of the team and coaches
let's take a look at Stanford football in a five-year period. If we do
this and look at college football in general we can see that football
teams nearly always play in cycles. They may win handily for six
to eight years then succomb to a losing drought of the same length
of time. Here on the coast we have seen nearly every team do this
from Washington who was everybody's breather three to four
years ago. and who this year will go to the Rose Bowl for ihe second
year in a row; to USC—whose football in the last few seasons has
not been of the high caliber that it was five to ten years back.
STANFORD IS CERTAINLY figuring in this same type of cycle.
In the days of Gary Kerkorian, Bob Garrett, John Brodie, Bill Tarr,
Paul Wiggin and Bill McColl the team always had a winning season.
Even before these modern-day teams, Stanford with Ernie Nevers,
Bobby Grayson, Frankie Albert and Chuck Taylor had top nation
ally ranked teams.
Right now, after our third losing season in a row. Stanford is
obviously in the down-swing of the cycle. Of course any time they
may pull themselves out. With the top-notch, spirited frosh team
and the rapidly developing sophomores like C. B. Simons. Stan Lind
skog, Gary Player, Steve Pursell and Chuck Buehler, Stanford may
easily have a winning ball club again in one or two years.
Bl T T WHAT ABOUT this yeai ? The big question is obviously
whether the team can beat OSC and at least Cal which is suffering
a similar fate i.e. they have won only one game, over these same
OSC Beavers.
Cal showed they could beat OSC and certainly Stanford has the
same chance. Here is a team which has the total offense leader in
the nation- the phenomenal Terry Baker—yet has a worse depth
problem than Stanford. Coach Tommy Protho has been filling in any
sub he can find to the guard spot and the team is still hurting all
through Ihe line positions.
OSC will be looking past to Oregon this weekend and we hope
Stanford is not looking past for Cal. If all eleven men can play ef
fectively together this weekend we will have our first win and thus
go into the Big One on an even keel with the Bears from the other
side of the Bay.
