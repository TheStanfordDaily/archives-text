TOUCH WITH TERRY AROUND â€” Junior tailback Don
Kasso, pictured above, had a rude awakening in store for
him when football season came around at Oregon State this
year. After leading the team in rushing last season, Kasso,
who was injured in an early game this year, was replaced on
the first team by sensational sophomore Terry Baker who is
currently leading the Beavers in running and passing. Baker,
Kasso and the rest of the Oregon Staters will see action
against Stanford in the Stadium Saturday.
