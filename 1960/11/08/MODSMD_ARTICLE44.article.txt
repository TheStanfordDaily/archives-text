A MODEST PROPOSAL
A movement is afoot—a shocking, startling movement—to
solve the problem of overcrowded colleges by the simple expe
dient of refusing admission to women at coeducational schools!
It is argued by proponents of tliis plan that in today's world
a college education is absolutely essential for a man, while for
a woman it is merely a pleasant interlude between adolescence
and housewifery. There is simply not room enough for both men
and women in our overburdened colleges; therefore, in all fair
ness, women who have far less need of a degree than men, must
yield their places.
Well sir, when 1 heard this drastic proposal, I was so shocked
that I sat right down and lit a Marlboro. I always sit right down
and light a Marlboro when lam shocked. 1 also always sit right
down and light a Marlboro when 1 am not shocked. There is
no time, no condition, no mood, no estate when it isn't a source
of soul-deep gratification to settle I tack and have a full-flavored
smoke—Marlboro, the filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste
— Marlboro, the jewel of cigarettes—Marlboro, the pinnacle of
the tobacconist's art—Marlboro, my comfort, haven, :ind snug
harbor.
Well sir, I sat smoking my Marlboro and thinking over the
shocking proposal to keep women out of coed schools, and hoping
fervently that another solution can be found. If the calamitous
day ever comes when women are banned from coed colleges, I
will gnash mv teeth and rend my garments and take to my bed
without supper. Like any other Marlboro man, 1 love women.
I love the sight and sound of them, the cut of their jibs, their
beauty and grace, their cunning little spitcurls, their sleek
dimples, their middy blouses, their aura and effluvium. More
over, I freely admit that when it comes to brainpower, they can
give the average man cards and spades and big casino too. It
would be a shame, a disgrace and a catastrophe to keep these
beautiful, intelligent creatures out of college.
However, it is always wise in time of fair weather to prepare
for foul. What if the advocates of keeping women out of college
begin to gather strength? We who abhor this fiendish plan must
be ready with a substitute ... and it just so happens I have
one and a mighty ingenious little plan it is, if I say so myself.
Granted that classroom seats are in short supply, and granted
that men need degrees more than women, it is still not necessary
to bar women from college. Let them go to college but—here is
the beauty part of my plan—don't Id them <j<> to class!

This solution, it seems to me, answers every requirement. Tt
releases hundreds «>l thousands of classroom seats to needy males.
At the same time, it does not deprive women of the rich and
varied benefits of campus life.They can join sororities, shoot pool
at the I nion, build bonfires for Homecoming games, pour at the
I Jean's tea, plait daisies in their hair, organize drag races, sculpt
in ice, hook rugs, walk their cheetahs, play Monopoly, find love
—in short, they can do anything except go to class.

a college education is absolutely essential for a man, while for
a woman it is merely a pleasant interlude between adolescence
and housewifery. There is simply not room enough for both men
and women in our overburdened colleges; therefore, in all fair
ness, women who have far less need of a degree than men, must
yield their places.
Well sir, when 1 heard this drastic proposal, I was so shocked
that I sat right down and lit a Marlboro. I always sit right down
and light a Marlboro when lam shocked. 1 also always sit right
down and light a Marlboro when 1 am not shocked. There is
no time, no condition, no mood, no estate when it isn't a source
of soul-deep gratification to settle I tack and have a full-flavored
smoke—Marlboro, the filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste
— Marlboro, the jewel of cigarettes—Marlboro, the pinnacle of
the tobacconist's art—Marlboro, my comfort, haven, :ind snug
harbor.
Well sir, I sat smoking my Marlboro and thinking over the
shocking proposal to keep women out of coed schools, and hoping
fervently that another solution can be found. If the calamitous
day ever comes when women are banned from coed colleges, I
will gnash mv teeth and rend my garments and take to my bed
without supper. Like any other Marlboro man, 1 love women.
I love the sight and sound of them, the cut of their jibs, their
beauty and grace, their cunning little spitcurls, their sleek
dimples, their middy blouses, their aura and effluvium. More
over, I freely admit that when it comes to brainpower, they can
give the average man cards and spades and big casino too. It
would be a shame, a disgrace and a catastrophe to keep these
beautiful, intelligent creatures out of college.
However, it is always wise in time of fair weather to prepare
for foul. What if the advocates of keeping women out of college
begin to gather strength? We who abhor this fiendish plan must
be ready with a substitute ... and it just so happens I have
one and a mighty ingenious little plan it is, if I say so myself.
Granted that classroom seats are in short supply, and granted
that men need degrees more than women, it is still not necessary
to bar women from college. Let them go to college but—here is
the beauty part of my plan—don't Id them <j<> to class!

This solution, it seems to me, answers every requirement. Tt
releases hundreds «>l thousands of classroom seats to needy males.
At the same time, it does not deprive women of the rich and
varied benefits of campus life.They can join sororities, shoot pool
at the I nion, build bonfires for Homecoming games, pour at the
I Jean's tea, plait daisies in their hair, organize drag races, sculpt
in ice, hook rugs, walk their cheetahs, play Monopoly, find love
—in short, they can do anything except go to class.
