# Candidates Make Last Attempts to Win Votes
## 
### 
CHICAGO (UPI i Vice President Richard M. Nixon, ignoring fatigue and proclaming he can
sense the election tide running in his favor, wound up his battle for the presidency with an unprece
dented television marathon and a fighting campaign swing back home to California last night.
His chartered plane took him from Anchorage, Alaska, to a chilled early morning rally at Madison,
Wis., and on to good crowds and the Detroit TV marathon, where he fielded questions telephoned and

telegraphed to him from voters
in all parts of the nation.
In the meantime Sen. John F.
Kennedy got a rip-roaring elec
tion eve sendoff from his home
town last night as he wound up
his campaign with a final plea
for American voters to judge him
on merit rather than on his
Roman Catholic religion.
In a whirlwind final day cam
paign through his native New
England, the Democratic presi
dential nominee also pledged to
embark immediately on a "peace
through strength" program it
elected to the nation's highest of
fice tomorrow.
KENNEDY touched on the cru
i cial religious issue in a 30-minute
! paid telecast from Manchester,
| N.H.. in reply to Vice President
i Richard M. Nixon's earlier four
j hour paid telethon from Detroit.
A hassle over TV expenditure
I highlighted a two-day swing
| through Kennedy's native New
England. Large crowds greeted
the candidate at Providence, R. 1.,
Springfield, Hartford, Conn.; Bur
lington, Vt.; and Manchester,
N.H., on the final day of the
10-week campaign.
Scores upon scores of thousands
of persons engulfed the Demo
crat ic presidential candidate's
motorcadc as it Crawled for an
hour along the three-mile route
from the Statler-Hilton Hotel to
the Boston Garden where Ken
nedy was acclaimed by a crowd
which filled the vast indoor hall
beyond its 15,000-seat capacity.
THE BOSTON Garden was a
quarter mile from Kennedy's of
ficial residence, where Kennedy
and his wife, Jackie, will cast
their own ballots tomorrow. Then
they will fly to their Cape Cod
home at Hyannis Port, Mass., to
await the nation's verdict.
Speaking with pride of the
Alaskan trip which had made him
| the first presidential candidate
i ever to visit all 50 states. Nixon
| said this has been "a rough cam
i paign now concluding."
In his four-hour session before
TV cameras in Detroit, Nixon
said the United States must strive
through negotiations with Soviet
i Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev
I for removal of his "iron control"
over captive peoples.
THERE WAS little of the bare
knuckle slashing attack in the
TV appearance that had charac
terized the final weeks of Nixon's
campaign. He stayed away from
single issues and said he wanted
manily to "talk in terms of what
the decision you will make
' means."
In a somewhat sentimental
j farewell to the campaign, Nixon
S thanked the nation for having
! twice honored him with the vice
presidency and"the opportunity
I of serving under one of the truly
| great men" Eisenhower.
These remarks were part of a
| campaign windup TV plea which
i included addresses from Wash-
I ington by President Eisenhower
! and from Boston by GOP vice
! presidential nominee Henry Cabot
Lodge.

His chartered plane took him from Anchorage, Alaska, to a chilled early morning rally at Madison,
Wis., and on to good crowds and the Detroit TV marathon, where he fielded questions telephoned and

telegraphed to him from voters
in all parts of the nation.

Kennedy got a rip-roaring elec
tion eve sendoff from his home
town last night as he wound up
his campaign with a final plea
for American voters to judge him
on merit rather than on his
Roman Catholic religion.
In a whirlwind final day cam
paign through his native New
England, the Democratic presi
dential nominee also pledged to
embark immediately on a "peace
through strength" program it
elected to the nation's highest of
fice tomorrow.
