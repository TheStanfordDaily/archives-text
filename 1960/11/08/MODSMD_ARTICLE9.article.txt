# Candidates Try For Last Votes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON <UPI) The
two presidential candidates made
their final campaign appeals last
night and turned over to more
than 60 million American voters
the solemn decision as to which
shall lead them in the next four
years.
Vice President Rich a r d M.
Nixon and Sen. John F. Kennedy
climaxed their intensive bids for
the presidency with nationwide
television appearances. Both
camps forecast victory in today's
voting. But Republican and Dem
ocratic strategists acknowledged
the outcome may hinge on a few
key states.
NIXON wrapped up his bid
with a four-hour telethon from
Detroit in the afternoon and a
final TV speech from Chicago in
the evening. The latter also fea
tured another public appeal by
President Eisenhower to keep the
Republicans in command of the
White House.
Kennedy stumped his home ter
ritory of New England and wound
up his campaign with a TV speech
to a Democratic rally in Boston.
Election day weather across the
nation was .expected to produce
a typical November varietyâ€”snow
flurries and rain in some spots;
cold crisp temperatures in others
but no drastic storms in sight.
A RECORD turn-out of voters
was anticipated. Republicans fore
saw 65 to 68 million going to the
polls. Democrats predicted the
number might climb above 69 mil
lion. The previous record vote
came four years ago when slightly
more than 62 million voters elec
ted Eisenhower for a second term.
Final public opinion polls before
the real thing begins gave Ken
nedy a slight popular vote edge
but not enough nationwide to
make Democrats over-confident.
Republican spokesmen cited the
polls as evidence Nixon would
win. They contended the straw
votes showed the vice president's
cause was being bolstered by a
last-minute tide while Kennedy's
popularity had passed its crest.
