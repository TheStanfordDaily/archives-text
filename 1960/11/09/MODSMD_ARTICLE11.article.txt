# The 						Task Ahead
## 
### 
Tt's all over. All tlie state-stomping, the promises, Iho slogans,
are in tho past. The American pooplo listened, saw and thought.
Yesterday they elected their choice for President of the United
States— John F. Kennedy.
In January the trial begins for the new President. He must
now prove that their faith in him has not been misplaced. The
American people ha\e voted for Mr. Kennedy because they feel he
is the man to keep America strong, to make America stronger.
Air. Kennedy has issued a challenge to the American people,
embodied in the concept of the New Frontier. The fact that he
has been elected would seem to indicate that a majority of the
people are aware of the challenge and are willing and anxious to
accept it.
Mr. Kennedy has made the normal amount of campaign prom
ises, hut we are not interested in promises. \\ hat every American
should want, whether he voted Republican or Democrat, is solu
tions to America's problems.
We want an administration that will alleviate the problem of
racial segregation, the slum problem, the farm problem. \\ e want
an administration that will turn back the Red lide, that will come
to some agreement with I he (lommunists to stop producing weapons
that forecast mass annihilation. We think that the question of capi
tal pimi.-hment and compulsory military training should be ana
lyzed.
As students, we should be particularly concerned with the
plight of education in this country. Mr. Kennedy stated in the
first Nixon-Kennedy debate: "I am not satisfied when the Soviet
1 nion is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as \vc
are. I am not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately
paid or when our children go to school in part-time shifts. I think
we should have an educational system second to none."'
Mr. Kennedy has supported aid to education and Federal aid
for teachers' salaries right down the line. However, be pointed out
that Federal aid is not the same thing as Federal control. In a
speech at Hockville, Md., on May 12, 1960, Mr. Kennedy said:
'"The issue is NOT one of Federal control of education. No one is
in favor of that. Traditionally local jurisdiction and academic free
dom must and will be scrupulously maintained . . ."
The facts are that 50.(100 more teachers are urgently needed to
relieve overcrowded classrooms, to enable children to go to school
full-time, or to teach the essential courses which simply are not
being covered. The average teacher today receives only $4,935 a
year, and 200,000 receive less than 53,500, reports the House Com
mittee on Education. The \\ all Street Journal reports a lag in 1959
school construction of about 11 per cent. School bond sales are
down 20 per cent.
Whether aid comes entirely from local sources or from local
sources with the aid of the Government, the point is that some
thing must be done about the education problem. Most people are
justifiably afraid of Federal aid to education if it means Federal
control. Mr. Kennedy should do everything possible to help edu
cation, including, in our estimation, the giving of Federal aid;
but he should also take the people's fears into account.
Probably the most troublesome problem facing America in the
next decade is one of foreign policy; how do we deal with the
Communists? Mr. Kennedy stated in a speech on Oct. 1, 1959, that
"There are real areas of potential agreement with the Russians.
. . . If we could succeed in reaching practical enforceable agree
ments in these areas, there would still be fierce competition in
trade and aid. in production and propaganda, in seeking friends
and building fences.
"Our security would still be at stake in this competition. But
the world's very survival would he less endangered. The Cold War
would be less likely to become hot ... I don I hold out any magic
hopes for a sudden thaw or a certain timetable. But we must
always he pressing for a gradual thaw, and make that alternative
seem more feasible, more desirable to Mr. Khrushchev than the
alternative of armed conflict."
This statement certainly reveals an optimistic outlook, although
Mr. Kennedy has been accused of being a pessimist and a negative
thinker. He has also recently proposed the creation of a ""Peace
Corps,"' a concept which the Daily discussed Mondav. This pro
posal indicates that Mr. Kennedy has a good grasp of the interna
tional situation. He realizes that at present America is not as strong
as it could be ideologically, although no one can question its mili
tary might. This "Peace Corps,"' if it is ever formed and we hope
it is—could go a long way toward closing this "ideological gap."
Air. Kennedy's New Frontier has naturally raised the fear of
increased taxes. In a Christian Science Monitor inter\iew last vear,
Mr. Kennedy said: "I would raises taxes if we found it to be neces
sary. However, we ought to make savings in other parts of the bud
get first. If we get unemployment within a manageable figure . . . !
then we should pay any increase in expenditures out of current
revenues. I am a Keynesian in that I believe in deficit financing
during periods of unemployment, but eventually we have to pay
the piper."
Mr. Kennedy obviously does not like the idea of increased taxes
and apparently has some ideas in mind to counteract the increase
if it is found necessary. But if increased taxes are necessary, then
the people should accept them as necessary.
I he problems facing Mr. Kennedy and the Democratic admin- !
istration are immense. It would not be fair to hope that all these
problems will be overcome in four years. However, the American
public has the right to assume that these problems will be at least
partially overcome.
The majority of the people have decided !o f;ill in behind Mr.
Kennedy and to follow him to the New Frontier. It is now his job
to lead us as he has promised. However, he will need the support
of all the people, whether Democrat or Republican. We call upon
everyone, regardless of how you voted or would have voted, to j
support this man and his administration. I lie time is too crucial,
too fraught with danger, to allow partisanship to rob us of unity. j
I,et us not forget that we are Americans first. Democrats or Re
publicans second.
