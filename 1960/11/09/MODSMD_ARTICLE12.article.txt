The Counselling Service is per
haps unique to the American edu
cation system. Since from exped
ience I found that this system is
probably the best one that is ex-
I tensively applied, I came to be
lieve lhat the Counsellors must
J have contributed much to this
success.
Disappointment came in short
order as I discovered that most of
them merely learned the courses
they had taken in college and then
parroted them to the unfortunate
students in difficulties. Occasion
ally, they would investigate into
the sources of such difficulties
and come up with insights such
as that of the "Third Person Re
sponsibility" (Daily, Nov. 4).
Mr. Black there asserted that
"the Honor Code at Stanford
faces its greatest challenge on the
issue of Third Person Responsi
bility, the obligation to discourage
dishonesty in others."
It certainly seems to me that
infraction of the Honor Code is
the symptom of something more
basic. "To live a lie for a lifetime
is the woi'st kind of hell," Mr.
Black said. The solution, however,
is not simply to "force secret
transgressions into the open."
When it is discovered that TB
is becoming rampant in a certain
area, the thing to emphasize is
not to discover and isolate the
unfortunate victims. This is im
portant, but even more important
is to look for the causes and to
eradicate them.
In this grade-oriented Univer
sity, the prime goal of a student
is to get as many A's as he can,
regardless of the means (unless
he is so disgusted with the whole
business as not to care). When
a graduate looks for a job, the
two main things interviewers
look at are personality and
grades. Breaking the Honor Code
affects neither of these.
The key factor in our education
system, many American educa
tors say, is competition. In this
competitive atmosphere the stu
dent is taught to "cut throats left
and right" so as to get to the top;
to be "successful." A rather ef
fective way, it seems to me, is to
cheat without detection.

Your issue of Monday, Nov. 7,
contains an outstanding example
of misleading journalism. You
state in your article on Mrs. Mil
dred Am lie, the deceased news
paper correspondent, that "she
. . . worked with Madame Sun
Yat Sen on Chinese papers for
the Kuomintang in the twenties
during the Chinese Revolution.
Both were forced to flee China
when the revolution collapsed in
1927."
This statement reflects a care
j less attitude toward historical
fact. What "revolution" are you
talking about? Are you implying
that the Kuomintang collapsed in
1927? The KMT expelled the Com
munists in 1927.
Is this what you mean by the
failure of the Chinese revolution,
or are you simply trying to gloss
over the fact (in defense of the
deceased) that Mis. Amlie at one
time may have harbored Com
munist sympathies, or have
worked with the Communists in
China. I do not in the least con
demn Mrs. Amlie ... I simply
object to sloppy reporting.

If ail Stanford students could
j have been present at Monday's
j civ lecture, they would have .seen
j their fondest wish realized: the
early indoctrination of the class
of '64 to the true Stanford way.
Yes, we do come to Stanford

only to put in our time, to breeze
from class to class, packing up
our books as soon as the bell
1 rings, ignoring the climax of any
j lecture which runs overtime, and
indeed hissing any lecturer who
dares it.
We greatly appreciate all dis
| tractions in the form of bursting
| balloons throughout the lecture,
j I only regrel that all the students
I did not realize that Monday morn
-1 ing's civ lecture is a continuation
j of Sunday night's flicks.

As an alumnus T am proud to
add my voice to the hundreds of
comments that were received this
past weekend about last Satur
day's tremendous student-rooter
performance.
I honestly feel that nothing has
done more for the University than
this exhibition of the famed Stan
ford Spirit, and that this was not
just a "show" support for Ihe
team alone. II demonstrated the
I kind of feeling that we alumni
| hold toward the University.
The Stanford student body won
a major victory which is shared
by all alumni, faculty and stall'. 1
know that I voice the sentiment
of everyone in the Department of
1 Athletics. More important, all the
alumni and friends of Stanford
have never been more proud!
Our thanks to all ihose who
stepped forward io meet the
challenge.

Your issue of Monday, Nov. 7,
contains an outstanding example
of misleading journalism. You
state in your article on Mrs. Mil
dred Am lie, the deceased news
paper correspondent, that "she
. . . worked with Madame Sun
Yat Sen on Chinese papers for
the Kuomintang in the twenties
during the Chinese Revolution.
Both were forced to flee China
when the revolution collapsed in
1927."
This statement reflects a care
j less attitude toward historical
fact. What "revolution" are you
talking about? Are you implying
that the Kuomintang collapsed in
1927? The KMT expelled the Com
munists in 1927.
Is this what you mean by the
failure of the Chinese revolution,
or are you simply trying to gloss
over the fact (in defense of the
deceased) that Mis. Amlie at one
time may have harbored Com
munist sympathies, or have
worked with the Communists in
China. I do not in the least con
demn Mrs. Amlie ... I simply
object to sloppy reporting.

As an alumnus T am proud to
add my voice to the hundreds of
comments that were received this
past weekend about last Satur
day's tremendous student-rooter
performance.
I honestly feel that nothing has
done more for the University than
this exhibition of the famed Stan
ford Spirit, and that this was not
just a "show" support for Ihe
team alone. II demonstrated the
I kind of feeling that we alumni
| hold toward the University.
The Stanford student body won
a major victory which is shared
by all alumni, faculty and stall'. 1
know that I voice the sentiment
of everyone in the Department of
1 Athletics. More important, all the
alumni and friends of Stanford
have never been more proud!
Our thanks to all ihose who
stepped forward io meet the

The Counselling Service is per
haps unique to the American edu
cation system. Since from exped
ience I found that this system is
probably the best one that is ex-
I tensively applied, I came to be
lieve lhat the Counsellors must
J have contributed much to this
success.
Disappointment came in short
order as I discovered that most of
them merely learned the courses
they had taken in college and then
parroted them to the unfortunate
students in difficulties. Occasion
ally, they would investigate into
the sources of such difficulties
and come up with insights such
as that of the "Third Person Re
sponsibility" (Daily, Nov. 4).
Mr. Black there asserted that
"the Honor Code at Stanford
faces its greatest challenge on the
issue of Third Person Responsi
bility, the obligation to discourage
dishonesty in others."
It certainly seems to me that
infraction of the Honor Code is
the symptom of something more
basic. "To live a lie for a lifetime
is the woi'st kind of hell," Mr.
Black said. The solution, however,
is not simply to "force secret
transgressions into the open."
When it is discovered that TB
is becoming rampant in a certain
area, the thing to emphasize is
not to discover and isolate the
unfortunate victims. This is im
portant, but even more important
is to look for the causes and to
eradicate them.
In this grade-oriented Univer
sity, the prime goal of a student
is to get as many A's as he can,
regardless of the means (unless
he is so disgusted with the whole
business as not to care). When
a graduate looks for a job, the
two main things interviewers
look at are personality and
grades. Breaking the Honor Code
affects neither of these.
The key factor in our education
system, many American educa
tors say, is competition. In this
competitive atmosphere the stu
dent is taught to "cut throats left
and right" so as to get to the top;
to be "successful." A rather ef
fective way, it seems to me, is to
cheat without detection.

As an alumnus T am proud to
add my voice to the hundreds of
comments that were received this
past weekend about last Satur
day's tremendous student-rooter
performance.
I honestly feel that nothing has
done more for the University than
this exhibition of the famed Stan
ford Spirit, and that this was not
just a "show" support for Ihe
team alone. II demonstrated the
I kind of feeling that we alumni
| hold toward the University.
The Stanford student body won
a major victory which is shared
by all alumni, faculty and stall'. 1
know that I voice the sentiment
of everyone in the Department of
1 Athletics. More important, all the
alumni and friends of Stanford
have never been more proud!
Our thanks to all ihose who
stepped forward io meet the
challenge.

The Counselling Service is per
haps unique to the American edu
cation system. Since from exped
ience I found that this system is
probably the best one that is ex-
I tensively applied, I came to be
lieve lhat the Counsellors must
J have contributed much to this
success.
Disappointment came in short
order as I discovered that most of
them merely learned the courses
they had taken in college and then
parroted them to the unfortunate
students in difficulties. Occasion
ally, they would investigate into
the sources of such difficulties
and come up with insights such
as that of the "Third Person Re
sponsibility" (Daily, Nov. 4).
Mr. Black there asserted that
"the Honor Code at Stanford
faces its greatest challenge on the
issue of Third Person Responsi
bility, the obligation to discourage
dishonesty in others."
It certainly seems to me that
infraction of the Honor Code is
the symptom of something more
basic. "To live a lie for a lifetime
is the woi'st kind of hell," Mr.
Black said. The solution, however,
is not simply to "force secret
transgressions into the open."
When it is discovered that TB
is becoming rampant in a certain
area, the thing to emphasize is
not to discover and isolate the
unfortunate victims. This is im
portant, but even more important
is to look for the causes and to
eradicate them.
In this grade-oriented Univer
sity, the prime goal of a student
is to get as many A's as he can,
regardless of the means (unless
he is so disgusted with the whole
business as not to care). When
a graduate looks for a job, the
two main things interviewers
look at are personality and
grades. Breaking the Honor Code
affects neither of these.
The key factor in our education
system, many American educa
tors say, is competition. In this
competitive atmosphere the stu
dent is taught to "cut throats left
and right" so as to get to the top;
to be "successful." A rather ef
fective way, it seems to me, is to
cheat without detection.

Your issue of Monday, Nov. 7,
contains an outstanding example
of misleading journalism. You
state in your article on Mrs. Mil
dred Am lie, the deceased news
paper correspondent, that "she
. . . worked with Madame Sun
Yat Sen on Chinese papers for
the Kuomintang in the twenties
during the Chinese Revolution.
Both were forced to flee China
when the revolution collapsed in
1927."
This statement reflects a care
j less attitude toward historical
fact. What "revolution" are you
talking about? Are you implying
that the Kuomintang collapsed in
1927? The KMT expelled the Com
munists in 1927.
Is this what you mean by the
failure of the Chinese revolution,
or are you simply trying to gloss
over the fact (in defense of the
deceased) that Mis. Amlie at one
time may have harbored Com
munist sympathies, or have
worked with the Communists in
China. I do not in the least con
demn Mrs. Amlie ... I simply
object to sloppy reporting.

Yes, we do come to Stanford

indeed hissing any lecturer who
dares it.
We greatly appreciate all dis
