### MARY LOU McKINLEY Associate Editor 
With Arthur Ivjiiior's "A View
From the Bridge," Palo Alto's
Comedia Repertory (' o m p a ny
proves that it is capable of han
dling forceful drama with intel
ligence and skill.
The production opened last
weekend at the Loft Theater, Em
erson at Hamilton in Palo Alto,
and is the most absorbing and
polished show this reporter ha«
seen the group produce.
While llie inner psychological
dilemma and near-perversities of
(lie central figure, Kddie, became
paramount, the play is just as con
cerned with human relationships
and (lie basic emotions which un
derlie the uncommon situation.
Thus, Eddie is always seen as and
felt to he a recognizably real in
dividual.
These Miller objectives, are ful
filled through the perceptive di
rection of Leslie Abbott and the
excellent performance of Eric
Sirlins as Eddie.
Sirlin's portrayal is startingly
realistic- yet controlled and pol
ished. This combination of skills
produces a characterization which
could stand out on any American
little theater stage.
Lisa Lauterer, who appeared at
Stanford in last year's "The
Moon Beseiged" and "Richard II,"
gives a fine performance as Bea
trice, Eddie's wife. Her role
might be enhanced by more no
ticeable emotional intensity -
especially in the first scene of
the play which needs a clearer
definition of the relationships be
tween Eddie, Beatrice and Eddie's
neice, Catherine.
Athena Martin takes the last
mentioned role and successfully
conveys the feelings of a young

gill, lull of life and enthusiasm
She lia», a fascinating face which
beautifully expresses her charac
ter's inner feelings whenever she
appears.
Taking Hie role of Rodolpho,
the illegal immigrant with whom
Catherine falls in love, is Tom
Bissinger, a Stanford senior. Blis
singer's role is a lighthearted one,
but he succeeds in expressing
Rodolpho's more intense emotions
as demanded in the second act.
Jim Wolf plays the lawyer
narrator-commentor with appro
priate reserve and understanding
of the situation which is evolving
around him.

j Another good performance is
1 given by Bill Huelsenkamp as
Marco.
i "A \ iew From (lie Bridge" is
ideally suited lor the small tliea
ter (].'>()- (HTsoii seating capacity).
While the limited playing area
hampers Coinedia's productions
of hig musicals, il physically pro
vides the intimacy necessary in
drama such as t his.
The show will continue Friday
' nighl at 8:30 at the Loft Theater.
Student tickets, priced at $1.25,
