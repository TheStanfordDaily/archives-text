# Jubilant Kennedy Lights Up

### 
HYANNIS PORT, Mass. (UPI)
Sen. John F. Kennedy remained
in seclusion with his wife early
today as he piled up a presidential
lead across the nation.
Newspapers in key cities de
clared Kennedy the winner over
Vice President Richard M. Nixon,
but the senator refrained from is
suing any victory statements of
his own.
KKNNKDV jumped with joy
and then lit a big black cigar last
night when he forged into the
lead. His mother, who had cam
paigned for him actively, visited
him at his home here, but: his
father, former ambassador Jo
seph P. Kennedy remained in his
home nearby.
Kennedy, â€¢surrounded by his
family at this Cape Cod resort
and kept informed by a small
army of tabulators and other
aides, watched election activities
on television and studied returns
showing him moving ahead.
His sister, Eunice, Mrs. R.
Sargent Shriver, said that when
Kennedy heard he had won Con
necticut, "Jack jumped with joy."
Every member of the Kennedy
family was on duty in the "com
mand post" set up in the home of
Robert Kennedy, the senator's
brother. Even film star Peter
Lawford had been put to work,
monitoring wire service printers.
Lawford is married to Kennedy's
sister, Pat.
"I THINK it's going fine," Law
ford said.
"It's going great," said his
wife.
As Kennedy began rolling up
an increasing lead over Nixon,
someone dashed out of Robert
Kennedy's house declaring, "Boy,
we've got a new president."
Salinger reappeared shortly
after 9:30 p.m. and said, "The re
turns continue to be very encour
aging from almost all over."
More than a dozen secret serv
ice men were in Hyannis Port,
ready to start guarding Kennedy
on a moment's notice if he was
elected.
Television technicians installed
special lights and other equip
ment outside Kennedy's back
door.
