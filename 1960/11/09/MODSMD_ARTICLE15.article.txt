# Nixon's Camp Switches from Happy to Glum
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (UPD— Spirits
drooped last night among some
3.000 supporters of Vice Presi
dent Richard M. Nixon as returns
mounted for Sen. John F. Ken
nedy in the presidential race.
The crowd gathered in the
Grand Ballroom of the Ambassa
dor Hotel where Nixon set up
headquarters had been alternately
glum and hopeful, but at 1 a.m.
there was evidence of a definite
depression.
Bars in the room were doing
a brisk business and the talk
turned to what kind of president
Kennedy would be in many con
versational groups.
A LOCAL disc jockey tried to
chum up enthusiasm, but he got
only a half-hearted response.
Washington hostess Perle
Mcsta, who supported Nixon,
however, drew a laugh when she
said, "I've left the Democratic i
Party. What can I do now? Will j
you take me in?"
Actor Caesar Romero said,
"Things could look brighter, but
I still haven't given up hope."
EVEN AS early as 8:30 p.m..
some of Nixon's supporters were
glum. At that time, Wallace
(Chicf> Newsman, Nixon's foot
ball coach at Whittier College,
said, "There isn't much hope, but
maybe if we could pick up a few
big Western states . .."
Hollywood celebrities present
included Dick Powell. Mary Pick- i
ford and Buddy Rodgcrs and
Spike Jones.
Powell led the crowd in singing
"God Bless America" early in the j
evening. *TO«i
