Some More Elections
THE NATIONAL elections are over but football politicking has
just begun. With eight games played and only two left in ihe waning
1960 season, the publicity men are charging out of the countryside
with their trumpets blaring All-American tunes.
Sports writers are never content to merely report the game. They
must predict, second guess and conduct polls to determine best
coaches, teams and players. All this doesn't seem to be lost on the
fans, in fact one of the highlights of every grid season is the All-
American balloting.
Contrary to their auspicious claims, however, All-American
polls are rarely successful in selecting the eleven best gridders in
the nation. There are too many other factors that lead to ihe selec
tion of an All-American than his actual playing ability.
IT'S NEAKLY impossible for the selectors to see more than a
few of the deserving candidates. From there on the experts rely on

comment from the press in other
parts of the nation and on word
of college publicity staffs. Usually
it happens that the bigger schools
have the best publicity programs
and most of the headlines are re
served for stars of these larger
colleges.
Since most of the selectors are
in the East and Midwest, more
of the outstanding players of that
area got national mention then do
the star gridders of tho West
Coast or the Rocky Mountain re
gion.
IT'S ALMOST an axiom of the
national selectors to include play
ers from each of the general
areas of the U.S. Thus after the
Midwestern and Eastern stars are
chosen, tho West Coast is usually
regulated to one, or at the very
most, two spots on the top team.
Another axiom is to choose

players of loams that wore rated that had winning seasons prefer
ably learns that were rated high in the national polls. Part of the
reasoning is that a top team is more apt to have great individual
stars than do average squads.
When everything is considered the difference between a good
football player and an All-American are mainly differences in luck.
KIGHT NOW Rill Kilmer, the UCLA tailback, is getting the
strongest support from local pickers. Kilmer, besides leading the
Big Five in punting, pas-sing yardage and total yardage, has the
added recommendation of playing for a team that has done fairly
well this season. UCLA has won four of their starts this season
while tying Purdue and losing to Washington.
Kilmer made his biggest bid for national recognition last Satur
day when he accounted for 225 yards while leading the Bruins to
a 28-0 win over the California Blue and Gold.
KILMER'S STIFFEN! 1 competition will come from Dave Grosz
of Oregon; Charlie Mitchell. Washington halfback; Oregon State
tailback Terry Baker and WSU quarterback Mel Melin.
The big edge goes to Kilmer, however, as he not only has the
better grid record, but he enjoys those necessary "extra advantages."
Baker and Melin are both playing for teams that haven't been able
to accumulate sustained winning streaks and so neither has really
been acclaimed on the West ''oast.
Mitchell is good and ho ] lays for a top team, but Charlie's a
sophomore and that hurts. G fosz is a good team ballplayer but he
doesn't have the big press n tices nor is he playing in one of the
larger population areas. Bob chloredt was a natural for AA honors
until he was injured in the U !LA game.
POSSIBLY THE BEST c the Western crop is Pervis Atkins
of New Mexico State. Who's Vtkins? No one but the leading scorer
in the nation last season. This year ho hasn't slowed down a bit.
as he again has piled up an impressive record of ground-gaining
and point making to lead New Mexico State to an undefeated mark
after seven games.
A Broken Record
SPEAKING OF All-Americans, Chris Burford might lose his
hard-earned national pass reception record. Chris made almost every
All-American tean last year and deservedly so; he was a fine all
around performer and he tied the old pass receiving record by haul
ing in 61 tosses in the 1959 campaign.
The combination of Dick Norman and Burford gave Stanford
the best college pass offense in the nation.
And so what happens this season? Hugh Campbell, a sophomore
end on the Washington State University squad has hooked up with
Melin to form almost as effective a twosome as the Stanford pair.
Campbell caught seven passes against OSC in last Saturday's
Beaver-Cougar fray to boost his season total to 51.
AT THAT HATE sophomore Hugh is averaging slightly more
than six catches per game, and if he continues he will break Bur
ford's mark. Burford tied the old mark by grabbing 12 aerials in
his last game and if Campbell has two days like that he'll totally
eclipse Burford's efforts.

Record in Danger
