# Baker-Led Beavers Next on Schedule
## 
### RUSS ALLEN 
STANFOKI) got an
other look it l tho Red Saunders
slyle single wing as Oregon Stale
invades the Farm this Saturday.
The Beavers have an impressive
! five and three record with wins
over IJSC, H oust on, Indiana,
Idaho and WSU.
Their three losses have been
| close contests dropped to lowa,
1 previously ranked No. 1 in the
Nation, a one-point defeat to
Washington, and an upset loss to
Cal.
The Beavers- picked preseason
j to finish near the bottom of Coast
standings- have pulled a few sur
prises this year. One was the
(opening defeat of USC in the
I Coliseum, and another was soph
| omore tailback Terry Baker.
BAKKR who did not play
freshman ball in seven games
reeled off 126.1 yards running and
passing to lead the nation in 1 otal
offense and break the previous
Beaver season total offense record
of another talented boy Joe
I Francis. During four of these
games Baker was playing behind
the swift Don Kasso who now
has been moved to the second
team.
Baker is tall for a tailbackâ€”
over 6'3" and can pass with
either hand, which makes him
very effective on end sweep op
tions from his single-wing posi
tion. He was quite an athlete in
i high school in Oregon being
named to tho football, basketball
! and baseball All-State squads.
Baker usually throws left
; handed to Aaron Thomas, Roger
Johnson and Amos Marsh*al ends;
or to the wingbacks Art Gilmore
: or Ron Miller. All five of these
I receivers are fast and shifty and
should give Stanford defensive
backs quite a problem all day
I Saturday.
THE CHIEF Beaver weakness
| has been lack of depth in the line
| and injuries to key linemen. Mike
Kline, a 6-foot 230-pound junior,
and Neil Plumley, a 6-6 240 jun
ior, are top tackles who hold the
hard-blocking Beaver line to
get her.
Coach Tommy Prothro has been
bothered with injuries to key cen
ter linemen especially at the
guard spot. Denny Pieters and
! Mike Watters should see a 10l of
j action but both boys have been

bothered by injuries and Prothro
has been looking around for two
games to find replacements.
Captain Doug Bashor, at center,
is another key lineman who has
been hurt. He lias been bothered
by a bad hip and leg. The offen
sive drive of the Beavers has been
hampered somewhat by his ina
bility to go 100 percent during
t he whole game.
ANY WAV you look at if, the
Beavers still have one of the most
talented backfields in the Nation
with Baker or Kasso at tailback,
Han Rivera or Chuck Marshall at
fullback, Maine Palmeteer or Tim
Ankerson at blocking back; and
Gilmore and Miller at wing.
But if the Indians bottle up
Baker they have bottled up the
whole Beaver attack and the Tribe
will work on this assignment all
week.
