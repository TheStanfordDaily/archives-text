# KENNEDY VICTORIOUS!
## Popular Vote Close Into Early Morning 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) — Sen John F. Kennedy won the presi
dency of the United States today -the first Catholic and youngest
man ever to be elected to the White House.
Vice President Richard M. Nixon, his Republican rival, condition
ally eenceded defeat in an appearance at his Los Angeles headquar
ters shortly before 12:30 a.m. (PSTi.
Smiling but sounding like a beaten man. Nixon said Kennedy
would be the next president "if the present trend continues."
KENNEDY waited on further word from Nixon an outright
concession—before making a statement.
Nixon went lo bed without sending the customary telegram of
congratulations to the presumptive winner. Nixon, however, did
"congratulate Mr. Kennedy for the fine race in the campaign" and
said he wanted Kennedy to know that "if this trend continues and
lie becomes president, he will have my full support."
A» that point, Kennedy's count on the United Press International
board was 264 electoral votes- .just five short of the needed majority.
But victory was assured by then. He had no runaway majority oJ
the popular vote, however, and won by the closest margin in any
presidential election at least since 1948.
Campaigning with the manner and personality pull of Franklin
D. Roosevelt, Kennedy won the same way by piling up massive ma
jorities in big cities which gave him the prized blocs of electoral
votes in the big states.
THE UI'I COUNT at 3 a.m. <PST> gave Kennedy 27,197,803 votes
compared to 26.308,204 for Nixon. Kennedy had only 50.83 per cent
of the two-party vote.
Kennedy had won 19 states with 264 electoral votes and led in
four others with 73 electoral votes for an indicated total of 337.
Nixon had won 21 states with 166 electoral votes and led in five
with 26 electoral votes for an indicated total of 192.
In the big battleground slates, Kennedy won New York, Pennsyl
vania, Michigan. New Jersey and his home state of Massachusetts.
Nixon won Ohio.
Kennedy led in both Illinois and Nixon's home state of California,
although both were still in doubt.

As expected, the Democrats easily hung on to control of Congress,
but it appeared that the GOP could make net gains in both House
and Senate.
WITH 34 SENATE seats at stake, Democrats had won 20 and led
in one undecided contest. With their 43 seats nat at stake this year,
Democrats had an indicated total of 66.
Republicans had won 12 scats, led in one contest still in doubt
and had an indicated total of 34 seats, counting their 23 holdover
members.
In the House, where all 437 seats were being filled, Democrats
had elected 244 members and led in 32 undecided contests for an in
dicated total of 267. Republicans had elected 145 and led in 35 other
contests for an indicated total of 170.
Kennedy apparently was both helped and hurt by his religion.
He lost the normally Democratic border states of Kentucky and Okla
homa. where his Catholic faith was a major issue, and most of the
heavily Protestant farm belt states of the Midwest.
HIS SHOWING in the big cities indicated that he benefitted from
the support of Catholic votes.
By losing Texas, Nixon failed to match President Eisenhower's
Southern record. But he did carry Virginia, Florida and Tennessee.
Mississippi ignored both presidential contenders and gave its eight
electoral votes to an unpledged slate of electors who would like
to throw the national election into the House if a majority could be
denied to either candidate.
Eisenhower, who had campaigned vigorously for Nixon in the
final days of the campaign, made an early evening appearance at
the GOP election headquarters here. He appealed to the rank and
file of his party to keep fighting until the final minute before the
polls closed.
SEN. KENNETH B. Keating, R-N.Y., a member of the GOP
"truth squad" that followed Kennedy around the country, conceded
Nixon's defeat shortly before 11 p.m. (PST) and extended congratu
lations to the Democratic nominee.
Another GOP source said "only a miracle" could keep (lie Demo
cratic candidate from taking over the reigns of government and lead
ing the nation on his promised campaign for a sounder and stronger
America.
But Nixon, who had appealed for a chance to build on President
Eisenhower's accomplishments, sat tight and looked hopefully to
Midwest and far Western states.
Fast-counting Kansas and other Republican strongholds gave
Nixon an early edge over his Democratic opponent. But ballots from
big cities and key industrial states rapidly wiped out the vice presi
dent's advantage.
