SAN FRANCISCO (UPI)

defeated Richard M. Nixon in the
vice president's home state and
home county yesterday and won
California's 32 electoral votes by
one of the narrowest margins in
the state's history.

lous in the nation and carrying
40.3 per cent of California's more
than six million votes.
Latest UPI tabulation showed
Kennedy winning by a margin of
little more than a tenth of one
per cent. He took approximately
50.12 per cent of the total vote.
WITH ONLY six precincts still
to be tallied of a total of 30,682,
the UPI count at 7:30 p.m. (10:30
p.m. EST> gave Nixon 3,085,940
and Kennedy 3,119,341.
Kennedy's plurality of 33,401
was enough to make it almost im
possible that he could be over
taken by absentee ballots.
In Los Angeles County the
final tally was 1,251,215 for Nixon
to 1,293.762 for Kennedy.
In 1916 California swung the
presidential to Woodrow Wilson
over Charles EvanS Hughes with
a handful of votes from Hum
boldt County and a statewide
edge of 3,773.
THE TREND for Kennedy was
established with the first votes
Tuesday night. At one point he
led by nearly 95,000. But Nixon
votes whittled away the lead until
with only the handful of small
precincts still to be counted Ken
nedy was firmly ahead.
Nixon conceded nationwide vic
tory to Kennedy after sizing up
prospects in California. Roger
Kent, Democratic State Chair
man and head of the Kennedy
for-president drive in California,
said he was certain Kennedy's
final margin in the slate would
be at least 53,000.
Bob Finch, Southern California
campaign manager for Nixon, re
fused to give up. "We may still
carry California on the basis of
absentee ballots," lve said. There
are 230,000 absentee ballots which
will be counted Nov. 14.
It was almost as tight a race in
1948. the last year in which Cali-
fornia went Democratic, when
former President Harry Truman
j defeated Thomas E. Dewey by a
margin of 17,8(5") votes.
San Francisco and Oakland,
I biggest city in Alameda County
| across the Bay, joined Los An
geles in swelling the Kennedy
J total. San Francisco gave Ken
i nedy a 55.000 mar gin and Ala
j meda County 34,000.
I Kennedy won also in Sacra -
I mento and F res no counties. Nix
; on's best showing in major conn
j ties were in Orange and San
; Diego, which he led by margins
j of approximately 10,000 in each.
With exception of San Diego,
ja traditionally republican area,
Kennedy's victory was fashioned
in 1 he industrial and metropolitan
sections of the state where unem
ployment and defense cutbacks
i were problems. He also ran ahead
i in areas heavily populated with
| minority groups, many of them
Catholic such as Los Angeles'
! Latin Americans.
Democrat ic leader s began
. claiming victory in California as
j early as 1 a.m. when Gov. Ed
mund G. Brown said "there is no
j question Kennedy will carry Cal
; ifornia." UPI declared Kennedy
I the winner at (5:05 a.m.
The two most important of the
j 15 propositions on the Tuesday
ballot appeared to be facing op
' posite fates.
Proposition 1, providing for a
$1.75 billion bond issue to store
and transport Northern Cali
fornia water to dry areas of the
state, was in a nip-and-tuck bat
tle. Los Angeles County's huge
and late vote was expected to
give approval.
PROPOSITION 15, the South
cran California proposal to switch
eight Northern California senate
seats to Southern California, took
a 3 to 1 beating. It lost in every
county but Los Angeles.
In California's 30-member Con
gressional delegation, each party
lost and gained one seat, leaving
ihe breakdown at l'i Democrats
and 14 Republicans. Rep. George
A. Kasem, D-West Covina, was
the only incumbent to lose.
The Democrats gained two
seats in the State Senate for a
30-10 majority there and fought to
a standstill with the GOP for
State Assemblv seats.
