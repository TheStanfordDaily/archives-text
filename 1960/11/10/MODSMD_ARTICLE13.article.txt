# An Unhealthy Institution
## 
### 
As this editorial is being written, President-elect Senator Jolm
F. Kennedy continues to lose ground in the popular vote. Mr.
Nixon lias been soundly beaten, but not by the overwhelming
majority of the voters.
Democrats will get approximately 50.28 per cent of the two
party total for a percentage margin of 0.46. This represents the
smallest margin since Democrat Grover Cleveland beat James G.
Blaine by less than 0.3.
Mr. Nixon probably will not pull ahead in the popular vote,
but it isn't too difficult to envision a race where one candidate
will have the majority of the people behind hint, but will lose in
the Electoral College. It has happened before and it should not
be allowed to happen again.
The Electoral College is simply an undemocratic process. Not
only can a candidate win the popular vote and still lose the elec
tion, but the members of the College in a state are not sworn to
vote for the candidate their particular state chooses. There is only
one example of a College member voting contrary to his state's
wishes but the possibility always exists.
Late Tuesday evening, one broadcaster considered a very fright
ening, although remote, possibility. Senator Kennedy had 268
electoral votes at one point, one short of the needed amount. The
broadcaster pointed out that if Senator Kennedy froze at that
number, Mr. Nixon could have received 261 electoral votes.
Mississippi did not cast its vote for either candidate. What
could have happened is that neither candidate would have had
enough to win and Mississippi would have been called upon to
determine who would be our next President.
The chance of this happening was almost nil but the very ex
istence of such a possibility is an unhealthy sign. What would
happen in the future if a state which didn't think enough of either
candidate to cast its electoral votes would be put in the position
of choosing the President?
Tuesday's election was too close for comfort. Yet, Senator Ken
nedy knew he was a winner as far as the Electoral College was
concerned long before he would have been so sure if the Electoral
College did not exist.
We realize that the pros and cons of the Electoral College have
been raised countless times, but we would like to raise them once
again. If this country is based upon democratic principles and
if the Electoral College represents a very harmful principle, then
why isn't the Electoral College destroyed?
Direct popular vote should be the only determinant in the
selection of President of the United States.

candidate to cast its electoral votes would be put in the position
of choosing the President?
Tuesday's election was too close for comfort. Yet, Senator Ken
nedy knew he was a winner as far as the Electoral College was
concerned long before he would have been so sure if the Electoral
College did not exist.
We realize that the pros and cons of the Electoral College have
been raised countless times, but we would like to raise them once
again. If this country is based upon democratic principles and
if the Electoral College represents a very harmful principle, then
why isn't the Electoral College destroyed?
Direct popular vote should be the only determinant in the
selection of President of the United States.
As this editorial is being written, President-elect Senator Jolm
F. Kennedy continues to lose ground in the popular vote. Mr.
Nixon lias been soundly beaten, but not by the overwhelming
majority of the voters.
Democrats will get approximately 50.28 per cent of the two
party total for a percentage margin of 0.46. This represents the
smallest margin since Democrat Grover Cleveland beat James G.
Blaine by less than 0.3.
Mr. Nixon probably will not pull ahead in the popular vote,
but it isn't too difficult to envision a race where one candidate
will have the majority of the people behind hint, but will lose in
the Electoral College. It has happened before and it should not
be allowed to happen again.
The Electoral College is simply an undemocratic process. Not
only can a candidate win the popular vote and still lose the elec
tion, but the members of the College in a state are not sworn to
vote for the candidate their particular state chooses. There is only
one example of a College member voting contrary to his state's
wishes but the possibility always exists.
Late Tuesday evening, one broadcaster considered a very fright
ening, although remote, possibility. Senator Kennedy had 268
electoral votes at one point, one short of the needed amount. The
broadcaster pointed out that if Senator Kennedy froze at that
number, Mr. Nixon could have received 261 electoral votes.
Mississippi did not cast its vote for either candidate. What
could have happened is that neither candidate would have had
enough to win and Mississippi would have been called upon to
determine who would be our next President.
The chance of this happening was almost nil but the very ex
istence of such a possibility is an unhealthy sign. What would
happen in the future if a state which didn't think enough of either
candidate to cast its electoral votes would be put in the position
of choosing the President?
