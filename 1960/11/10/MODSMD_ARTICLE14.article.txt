# 'The Apple Cart'
## 
### SONYA MICHELE 
Versatility in creating charac
ters and political situations
marks the work of George Ber
nard Shaw. Treating all with a
light touch, he demands equal
versatility and a sense of the ri
diculous from his actors.
The production of "The Apple
Cart" now playing at the Bella
Union Theater in San Francisco
does not entirely meet the Sha
vian challenge. The play is set
in late-twentieth century Britain,
when the prime ministers of King
Magnus are trying to limit the
powers of their constitutional
monarch. Magnus, determined
not to become an "indiarubber
stamper," upsets the apple cart
by threatening to abdicate the
throne and run for the House of
Commons himself.
The cabinet Shaw ha,s assem
bled includes a high-minded labor
union leader, an ex-songstress
Postmistress General, and an ex
schoolteacher Powermistress Gen
eral. These parts are played re
spectively by Del da Pena, appro
priately awed and humbled by
court life, Karel McDougall, friv
olous and with enough of a sense
of the ridiculous to break into
a bawdy song during a heated
argument, and Margaret Binlkly,
in contrast serious and blindly de
voted to royalty and providing
power for England. Dale Richard
son does well as the crafty, tem
peramental prime minister of the
group.
Bernard Flath, Vincent Butler,
and Cyril Clayton are unfortu
nately mediocre as the Home
Secretary, Foreign Secretary, and
Colonial Secretary. They are in
sensitive to the antics of the
other cabinet members. Eugene
Bowlds, who has a potentially
humorous part as Chancellor of
the Exchequer, buries all his
good lines in an over-generous
beard.
King Magnus is a man of great
tact and persuasive powers, and
looks upon his dealings with the
cabinet as a great card game,
which he and the prime minister
play with equal skill, except Mag
nus has an ace up his sleeve. But
in this role, Walter Mahoney

gives a rather un-self-confident
impression with his cabinet.
It is only in the scene with his
glamorous mistress Orinthia,
played by Caroline Wiley, that he
relaxes and the play rises to the
light, witty level Shaw intended.
He is slightly more restrained,
but still suave, opposite his wide,
bespectacled queen, Jemima.
Charlyn Bowlds, in this role, re
veals the subtle pressures ex
erted by a seemingly frivolous,
but all-knowing wife on her pas
sive husband.
The play fails to rise to the bait
of Shaw's final farcical touch: the
announcement that the United
States has decided to re-annex it
self to (lie British Empire. James
Stack, as a Shavian burlesque on
the hark - slapping, big - talking
American ambassador, is too anx
ious in bringing this information
to the king. The potentially light,
absurd s<*ene, is a bit heavy.
Granted, Shaw is presenting
some pretty serious business in
"The Apple Cart," but all the
while with a sense of absurdity.
The Interplayers do not take ad
vantage of the full range of
character studies woven into the
situation. Even so, Shaw comes
through as a brilliant social and
political critic, who presents not
only the actor, but the playgoer,
with a challenge.
