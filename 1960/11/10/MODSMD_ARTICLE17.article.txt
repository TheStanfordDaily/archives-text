Editor, the Daily:
This is the end!
So we decided to give the team,
finally, a good loud suport; so we
decide not to throw water bombs
at the yell leaders; so we decide
to be nice and not R.F. too much
and what do we get? The women
want to sit with us!
This is the end!
What kind of people do they
think we are? Not satisfied with
having a rather favorable ratio,
with having a tremendous pres
tige, with being the center of male
attention around campus, they
now want to be in the middle of
everything at the football games!
I realize that integration of
rooting sections has, in the past,
become an issue in other cam
puses, but here at Stanford we
should never let it become an
issue. The case is too clear-cut.
We go to football games to watch
our team play, not to sit close to
a girl. We do that at the movies
under more favorable condi
tions. . . .

Women in this campus, and
everywhere -else for that matter,
.should realize that the center of
attention at football games is out
there in the middle of the field
and not around their own little
selfish selves.
Let me then, with all this in
mind, urge my LASSU represent
ative to move in any direction
that he -sees fit to stop this mat

ter from becoming an issue. Let's j
keep togetherness until after the ;
game!
Hail Kortozian!
