I'ilitor, the Daily:
It was very interesting to read
Mr. Duignan's two articles on the
subject of U.S. African policy.
The competence of Mr. Duignan
on this subject is very well
known, I want merely to discuss
the basic idea behind his state
ments.
I am convinced that if carried
to its logical conclusion his pro
position would lead to a policy of
harmful relativism. The struggle
between the United States and the
Soviet Union is not merely politi
cal or economic, but also ideologi
cal. Soviet power politics arc com
bined with a forceful ideology. If
we confront this merely with a
pragmatic, ad-hoc policy we shall
be at a definite disadvantage.
The paradox of totalitarian pol
itics is that all means are justi
fied by an apparently inflexible
ideology. The paradox of demo
cratic politics is that in spite of
the non-doctrinarian character of
our own ideas, their application
may freeze our policy along rigid
lines. I say may, because I would
not equate idealism with naivete.
A realistic application of our
ideas could be realpolitic in its
truest sense.
Specifically, if we declare that
in Africa we are against colonial
ism we are obviously right. If we
see to it that this principle should
be carefully applied to each in
dividual case 1 hen we are realistic.
Only this combination could lead

to an affective foreign policy.
