# AXIOM DEMOLISHED
## Kennedy Election Defies Tradition; Religious Issue Many-Sided 
### NORMAN RUNNION United Press International 
WASHINGTON. Sen. John F.
Kennedy's election demolished the
old political axiom that a Catho
lic could never reach the White
House. But it also proved that in
1960 religion was a campaign
issue that cut both ways.
Take two examples: In Sulli
van County, Indiana, where the
Catholic population is only 2 per
cont, Vice President Richard M.
Nixon won by a comfortable mar-
Kin. In 1956 the Democrats polled
nearly 60 per cent of Sullivan's
vote.
UIJNTON COUNTY in New
York has a 60 per cent Catholic
population. In 19.16 it gave Presi
dent Eisenhower 71 per cent of
its vote. Kennedy carried it yes
terday by 13,333 to 10,947.
Whether religion was a pre
dominant issue in these two coun
ties is something that experts will
study for a long time to come,
i But it seems clear that here, as
in other parts of the country, a
good many Republican Catholics
voted for Kennedy and a good
many Democrat Protestants voted
against him.
The religious issue clearly had

a significant impact on the cam
paign, but it's going to need a
lot of research 1o determine
whether Kennedy was helped or
hurt. There is strong presumptive
evidence of "bloc voting" on both
sides.
KENNEDY carried eight of the
12 states which have more than
30 per cent Catholics in their pop
ulation—New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Mas
sachusetts, Rhode Island, Louisi
ana and Hawaii.
In Connecticut, which has a
45 per cent Catholic population,
I Kennedy completely reversed the
i Eisenhower landslide of 19.1(5.
He failed to carry four other
heavily Catholic states New
Mexico, Vermont, New Hamp
shire and Wisconsin.
On tlie other hand, it appeared
highly plausible that Kennedy's
Catholicism was an important

factor in his (Ideal in normally-
Democratic Oklahoma, Kentucky
and Tennessee. In all of these
states, fundamentalist Protestant
denominations are predominant.
However, he won narrow vic
tories in Texas and South Caro
lina, where Protestant clergymen
had been especially outspoken
against a Catholic for President.
ALTHOUGH he lost Florida
and Virginia, ho carried Georgia
and North Carolina, which have
only about 1 per cent Catholics
in their populations.
In 1928, when Al Smith, the
only other Catholic to run for
President, was defeated, there
were 19 million Catholics in the
United States. This was I<> per
cent of the population.
Today there are 40 million
American Catholics. They consti
tute 21 per cent of the popula
tion.

against him.
The religious issue clearly had

a significant impact on the cam
paign, but it's going to need a
lot of research 1o determine
whether Kennedy was helped or
hurt. There is strong presumptive
evidence of "bloc voting" on both
sides.
KENNEDY carried eight of the
12 states which have more than
30 per cent Catholics in their pop
ulation—New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Mas
sachusetts, Rhode Island, Louisi
ana and Hawaii.
In Connecticut, which has a
45 per cent Catholic population,
I Kennedy completely reversed the
i Eisenhower landslide of 19.1(5.
He failed to carry four other
heavily Catholic states New
Mexico, Vermont, New Hamp
shire and Wisconsin.
On tlie other hand, it appeared
highly plausible that Kennedy's
Catholicism was an important

factor in his (Ideal in normally-
Democratic Oklahoma, Kentucky
and Tennessee. In all of these
states, fundamentalist Protestant
denominations are predominant.
However, he won narrow vic
tories in Texas and South Caro
lina, where Protestant clergymen
had been especially outspoken
against a Catholic for President.
ALTHOUGH he lost Florida
and Virginia, ho carried Georgia
and North Carolina, which have
only about 1 per cent Catholics
in their populations.
In 1928, when Al Smith, the
only other Catholic to run for
President, was defeated, there
were 19 million Catholics in the
United States. This was I<> per
cent of the population.
Today there are 40 million
American Catholics. They consti
tute 21 per cent of the popula
tion.
WASHINGTON. Sen. John F.
Kennedy's election demolished the
old political axiom that a Catho
lic could never reach the White
House. But it also proved that in
1960 religion was a campaign
issue that cut both ways.
Take two examples: In Sulli
van County, Indiana, where the
Catholic population is only 2 per
cont, Vice President Richard M.
Nixon won by a comfortable mar-
Kin. In 1956 the Democrats polled
nearly 60 per cent of Sullivan's
vote.
UIJNTON COUNTY in New
York has a 60 per cent Catholic
population. In 19.16 it gave Presi
dent Eisenhower 71 per cent of
its vote. Kennedy carried it yes
terday by 13,333 to 10,947.
Whether religion was a pre
dominant issue in these two coun
ties is something that experts will
study for a long time to come,
i But it seems clear that here, as
in other parts of the country, a
good many Republican Catholics
voted for Kennedy and a good
many Democrat Protestants voted
against him.
