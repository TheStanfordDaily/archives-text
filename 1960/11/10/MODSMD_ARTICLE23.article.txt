# Speculation Commences on New Cabinet
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP!) Ches
ter Bowles and Sen. J. William
Fulbright were mentioned yester
day as two leading candidates for
Secretary of state in the Kennedy
administration.
President-Elect John F. Kenne
dy told reporters yesterday that
he probably would not announce
his cabinet selection until after
Thanksgiving, or even later.
Publicly, he has made no com
mitments to anyone. Despite this,
there has been speculation on the
men he may pick for practically
every job in his new cabinet.
Guessing shapes up this way:
Secretary of State â€” Bowles,
who was one of Kennedy's main
foreign policy advisers in the
campaign. Ot her s prominently
mentioned are Fulbright, Chair
man of the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, and David
Bruce, former Ambassador to
Germany. Kennedy made some
highly complimentary campaign
references to Bruce as a career
ambassador.
Adlai E. Stevenson had long
been mentioned as a possible Sec
retary of State. He might have
gotten the job too if he had
thrown support to Kennedy be
fore the Democratic Convention.
But he didn't. Now he is being
mentioned as a possible U.S. Am
bassador to the United Nations.
Defense Speculation centers
around Thomas K. Fin letter, for
mer Air Force Secretary in the
Trum a 11 Administration; Dan
Kimball, former Navy Secretary,
Frank Pace, former Army Secre
tary, and Sen. Stuart Symington,
D-Mo., who was Air Force Secre
tary in the Truman Administra
tion. Symington has been advis
ing Kennedy on defense during
the campaig.n He said last Nov.
2 that he did not want the job
and would rather remain in the
Senate.
