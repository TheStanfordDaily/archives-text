# Eisenhower Offers Kennedy Congratulations, Cooperation
## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (UPI) President Eisenhower formally offered
yesterday to cooperate fully with President-Elect John F. Kennedy
to assure a smooth changeover of administrations next Jan. 2U.
The chief executive invited Sen. Kennedy to name observers to
work with cabinet members and other high government officials
during the transition period.
The president dispatched a telegram to the senator making sug
gestions to ease any possibilities in shifting to Democratic rule after
eight years of a Republican regime.
The White House said the contents of the wire, together with a
reply by the incoming chief executive, would be withheld until this
morning. A joint release was planned both at the temporary White
House here and at Kennedy's headquarters at Ilyannis, Mass. on the
exchange of communications.
Presidential Press Secretary James C. Hagerty said, however, it
would be fair to say that Eisenhower's message offered to have the
present administration work with the senator's representatives until
inauguration day.
The president stressed the necessity for full cooperation with
the newly chosen leaders at an hour-long meeting of the cabinet and
other top government officials, Magerty said.
