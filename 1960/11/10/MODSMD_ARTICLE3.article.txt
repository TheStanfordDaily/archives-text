## 
### GREGG HOPKINS 
Money troubles struck the In
dependent Californian this week
and as a result its editorial staff
has discontinued daily publica
tion. Meanwhile constitutional
amendments which may alter the
troublemaking details of the Cal
publication situation are up be
fore the student body.
The Independent's advertising
revenues haven't been great
enough to support a 4-page daily,
bin arc plenty for an 8- or 10-
page weekly paper, a staff mem
ber reported. The next issue of
the Independent is planned for
next Tuesday, when the two
amendments art 1 up for vote.
Each of the two proposals, one
formulated by the ASUC Ex-Corn
the group that began the two
newspaper system at Cal when if"
declared it would have authority
to appoint editorial staffs of
ASUC publications and one put
on the ballot by student initia
tive, would appoint a separate
board to have charge of publica
tions. The propositions differ in
their approach to financial con
trol and who shall have final
jurisdiction over the editorial ap
pointments. Iti the Ex-Com pro
posal, Ex-Com retains top au
thority.
