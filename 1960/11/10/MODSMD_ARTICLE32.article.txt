						SPORTING PROPOSITION

### Ken Dery 
THIS COLUMN was to be written last Wednesday and entitled
"The West Coast's Cinderella Team," but even sportswriters must
sometimes break down and study for midterms so the story was
never done. The subject was to be the University of Washington
football team- last year the class of the West and smashing Rose
Bowl champions this season fighting foy their lives each and every
Saturday.
That is what the column was supposed to tell. The last sentence
was to read: How long can they do it? But last Saturday down in
Los Angeles the question was answered in the strongest way pos
sible. Coach Jim Owens' Huskies completely crushed the challenging
USC Trojans by 34-0 to earn another trip to Pasadena and the roses.
But let's not get too far ahead of our story, for even though
this week's column is best entitled "the Cinderella team that got
mad," there are many past one-point victories, many pa,st clutch
performances, and many just plain lucky breaks that have carried
this team throughout the season and merit our observation.
LAST YEAR the Huskies climaxed a 9-1 slate by making fools
out of Big Ten representative Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl, 4-1-8. llow
is it possible that the 1959 squad, with not one starter graduated,

could become 1960's Cinderella
team?
Glance at the talent: Bob
Schloredt, the 195-pound, G-l sen
ior quarterback was All-America
last season and one of the finest
team leaders seen in a long time;
George Fleming a mature 22-
year-old who had been a tremen
dous running halfback for two
seasons who seemed to get better
and better; Don McKeta- a fan
tastic slashing-type runner who
could single-handedly defeat any
opponent.
Add 1o these men others such
as Charlie Mitchell, at 180 pounds
and 5-11, considered the best
break-away threat at Washington
since Hugh McElhenny; Bob
Hivner —the second-string quar
terback who could start on nine
out of ten college teams; Ray
Jackson the stocky 5-9 senior

fullback who averaged just under five yards per carry all last year
on line smashes up the middle. To any football prognosticator, the
Seattle boys looked like the solid rock favorite in every game they
would play. What happened?
FIRST OF ALL not too many people outside the state of Wash
ington realized just how strong the second team was last season.
While all of the first team was back, many of the hard-nosed re
placements were no longer around to spell them.
The second reason was injuries—always an important part of
football. The Huskies very early in the season found out how tough
it is to operate with a lot of players not up to par physically.
In the first two games of the season all went very well against
opponents that were mediocre at best. Lopsided triumphs over the
College of the Pacific (55-6) and Idaho 142-12) carried the Huskies
to third-place in the national rankings.
The Upstart Middies From Navy
Then in the third contest for both teams, eighteenth-ranked Navy
handed the high-flying West Coast boys a stunning 15-14 upset on
a 31-yard field goal by Gregory Mather with fourteen seconds re
maining to be played. Little did the 57,000 fans watching the game
realize thi-s tense cliffhanger was to set the pattern for weeks to
come, lit must be added that this historic field goal struck the
cross bar of the goal post and decided to go over rather than fall
short, i
THE GAME WITH Stanford the followng week had no real
meaning for the damage had already been done—the Huskies had
taken a nosedive out of the top ten ranked teams in the country.
And the Indians were not strong enough to provide Washington
a chance to substantially gain back its prestige through an outstand
ing victory. To the surprise of no one the score was 29-10 Washington.
On October 11. again at Seattle, the scrambling Huskies took on
the powerful UCLA Bruins. The clutch score of 10-8 in favor of
Washington does not even begin to tell the story. Washington's
margin of victory was provided by George Fleming's 38-yard field
goal. 42 seconds before the end of the first half, and two goal-line
stands that thwarted Bruin Bill Kilmer's second-half heroics. The
Huskies threw UCLA back twice after the southlanders had pene
trated inside the ten-yard stripe. The triumph was a costly one, how
ever, as quarterback Bob Schloredt was lost for the season when he
suffered a broken collarbone while defending against a pass. The
Husky eleven was so battered up in this game that the second and
third string defensive units saw most of the action. Then when UCLA
would mount a drive and get inside the Washington thirty-yard line
the injured first team would re-enter the game to try and stop them.
The bruising battle was truly a great team effort. UCLA had 21
first downs to 12 for the Huskies, but an old axiom still holds true:
They don't ask you how they ask how many.
The Comeback of the Year
The very next week in Portland, against Oregon State, the
Huskies rallied again and again in what this writer considers the
finest comeback made by any major team in the country this
season. Down 12-0 at the quarter and being trounced 22-7 at the
half Fleming and friends just refused to quit until they heard that
final gun. Midway in the third period they were on the short end
of a 29-15 count and the standing-room crowd must have believed
that they had no chance to pull it out. But pull it out they did as
Fleming calmly kicked the tie-breaking extra point with but two
minutes left. The final score was 30-29 with Fleming contributing
38- and 12-yard touchdown runs and the kick for the money.
THE LAST of the spine-tingling affairs, a 7-6 decision over the
Oregon Ducks on October 29, will not soon be forgotten by the sell
out crowd of 55,700 who journied to Seattle, the home of the Huskies.
When perennial hero Fleming booted the perfect extra point with
2:24 minutes left on the clock, still another victory had been put into
the Washington record books.
Nothing Left But McKeta and Fleming
Oregon took the lead in the third period and it looked like their
six points were going to hold up as the game drew to a c4o.se. But
with only five minutes left to play, Washington took over the ball
on Hivner's third pass interception of the day on its own five. Gam
bling for the big play, the Huskies took to the air but apparently
were fresh out of everything but hope when they reached a fourth
down and six yards to go situation. Hivner faded back and saw Don
McKeta about ten yards down field angling toward the sideline.
4'he pass itself was easy enough, but what followed can really only
be known by the people who saw it. McKeta, with great heart and
plenty of moxie gathered in the aerial and seemed to slid toward
the sidelines to stop the clock—common procedure at such a late
stage. Then with Oregon defensive halfback Dave Grayson relaxing
slightly in his pursuit McKeta, by what must have been'pure instinct,
felt he had the chance for glory. He wheeled on his heel to take his
chance in the open field. Those 47 yards to a touchdown had tears
and screams every inch of the way, but the Husky halfback had
robbed Fort Knox- he was that golden.
When Fleming stood ready to kick the winning point, no one even
though! he might miss. The loss of an All-Ainerican quarterback,
playing teams that always put out that little extra to heat you—none
of these counted as the hall sailed cleanly through the uprights. The
Huskies had done it again. Their trouncing of USC the following
week seems a just reward for past duty.
