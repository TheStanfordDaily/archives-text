# Indian Gridders Prepare For Oregon State Passing
## 
### RUSS ALLEN 
STOPPING Oregon Slate's tal
ented Terry Baker will be Stan
ford's big chore this Saturday as
the Indians try once more for a
win this season.
Stanford gridders have been
working on defenses all week to
stop the Beavers' single-wing
attack and theii' most important
objective will be to stop the pass
ing and off-tackle and end sweeps
of tailback Baker.
Last week Washington State
showed that they could stifle the
Beaver passing attack with a good
rush and no doubt Coach Jack
Curtice has his Indian linemen
working on this phase for the
Saturday contest.
ONE MORE the Indians will be
bothered by lack of depth at guard
for the home weekend tilt. Both
Ron Fernandes- with a bad ankle
and Errol Scott with a shoul
der injury will be sitting this
one out. However, both may see
action in the all-important Big
Game with Cal in two weeks.
End Vie Preisser was also lost
to the team in practice two days
ago. The reserve end was hit head
on in a scrimmage and suffered a
shoulder separation. There is no
word as yet as to whether he will
be ready for Cal.
THERE IS one bright note for
the underdog Cards in this clash
with OSC. The Beavers are the
one team on the coast with a
worse pass defense than Stanford
â€”as Dick Norman found last year
as he passed the Tribe to a 39-22
victory in Corvallis.
Therefore, Stanford receivers
should get a big workout against
the lowly rated Beaver pass de
fense.
The Indians will be out to stop
a nine-game losing streak, and
things look right for a Tribe up
set against the Beavers.

Loss hurts Tribe
