# Poetry, Philosophy Presented by Frost
## 
### JUDY SEABORG 
Describing himself as "good-natured, but malicious," American
poet-philosopher Robert Frost rambled through a variety of poetry,
politics, and philosophy last night before an over-capacity audience
in Memorial Auditorium.
The California-born poet, introduced by Wallace E. Stegner as a

man who "has had night and
day, shadow and sunshine, and
who triumphs over his darkness,"
discussed at random topics in
cluding his method of writing
poetry—"l tumble into the first
line or two and then I'm stuck;"
Tuesday's election—"lt was a tri
umph of Protestantism over it
self;" ladies—"They don't praise
ladies any more; they let them
vote;" and religion "The Catho
lic Church always has trouble
with its saints. I expect to see
Martin Luther canonized."
INTERSPERSED among his
comments were portions and com
plete selections of his works in
cluding old favorites such as
"M ending Wall," "You Come,
Too," "Stopping by Woods on a
Snowy Eve," and "Birches." Frost
also recited some of his later
works including "In Praise of a
Lady" and a ghastly ghost tale
entitled "Witch Cause."
Frost appealed to his delighted
occasionally with queries such as
"I don't believe in any special
mental age. do you?" or "Do you
happen to know what a hoc is?
And a rake?"
"IT'S A HARD world to get
understood in," commented Frost,
adding to the audience, "and I
don't really care if you do under
stand." "Poets are supposed to
suffer more than we really do,"
he confided later. "I make a liv
ing barding around like Homer
for my bread and butter. It's a
form of beggary."
Other subjects discussed in
cluded the universe "Things go
ing around in rings;" history
"The one big issue of the last 1011
years has been to see what coun
try would dominate what
bus discovered;" prophecy "I
change more the further I look
ahead;" the Reformation "We've
got the Catholic Church where
we can live with il;" and the presi
dent's cabinet "I'd like to see a
Secretary of Arts in the cabinet
to re present arts among those
fellows there in big business."
Frost, recipient of four Pulitzer
Prizes as well as numerous other
honors including the 1938 gold
medal of llic National Institute of
Arts and Letters, has appeared
at Stanford twice before, in 1953
and 1958. As Stegner commented,
Kach I imc il gels bet tei."

ROBERT FROST AUTOGRAPHS BOOKS
After the Poet-Philosopher Spoke Last Night
Describing himself as "good-natured, but malicious," American
poet-philosopher Robert Frost rambled through a variety of poetry,
politics, and philosophy last night before an over-capacity audience
in Memorial Auditorium.
The California-born poet, introduced by Wallace E. Stegner as a

man who "has had night and
day, shadow and sunshine, and
who triumphs over his darkness,"
discussed at random topics in
cluding his method of writing
poetry—"l tumble into the first
line or two and then I'm stuck;"
Tuesday's election—"lt was a tri
umph of Protestantism over it
self;" ladies—"They don't praise
ladies any more; they let them
vote;" and religion "The Catho
lic Church always has trouble
with its saints. I expect to see
Martin Luther canonized."
INTERSPERSED among his
comments were portions and com
plete selections of his works in
cluding old favorites such as
"M ending Wall," "You Come,
Too," "Stopping by Woods on a
Snowy Eve," and "Birches." Frost
also recited some of his later
works including "In Praise of a
Lady" and a ghastly ghost tale
entitled "Witch Cause."
Frost appealed to his delighted
occasionally with queries such as
"I don't believe in any special
mental age. do you?" or "Do you
happen to know what a hoc is?
And a rake?"
"IT'S A HARD world to get
understood in," commented Frost,
adding to the audience, "and I
don't really care if you do under
stand." "Poets are supposed to
suffer more than we really do,"
he confided later. "I make a liv
ing barding around like Homer
for my bread and butter. It's a
form of beggary."
Other subjects discussed in
cluded the universe "Things go
ing around in rings;" history
"The one big issue of the last 1011
years has been to see what coun
try would dominate what
bus discovered;" prophecy "I
change more the further I look
ahead;" the Reformation "We've
got the Catholic Church where
we can live with il;" and the presi
dent's cabinet "I'd like to see a
Secretary of Arts in the cabinet
to re present arts among those
