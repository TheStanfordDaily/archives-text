# Nixon Concedes; Kennedy Starts To Effect Government Transfer
## National Chairmen Debate Issues Leading to Outcome 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI>- President-Elect John F. Kennedy moved
swiftly today to provide for a Republican-to-Demoerat transfer of the
government on the heels of his photo-finish victory over Richard M.
Nixon.
Shortly after Nixon fully conceded defeat in the cliff-hanging

presidential election, the 43-year
old winner began arranging for
conferences with the Eisenhower
administration preparatory to
taking over the reins of govern
ment Jan. 20.
President Eisenhower invited
Kennedy by telegram to name
men who will work with cabinet
members and other high govern
ment officials during the transi
tion period. The president-elect
expected to appoint his represent
atives today.
As this government business
proceeded, signs of a Republican
family fight cropped up in the
wake of the OOP's election de
feat. Arraigned against each
other were conservative backers
of Sen. Barry M. Goldwater and
supporters of New York Cov. Nel
son A. Rockefeller.
AT THE SAM 10 time, the Dem
ocratic and GOP national chair
men split over whether Ken
nedy's showing in the four TV de
bates or Republican losses in the
big "Negro vote" areas had the
greatest effect on the election
outcome.
At Hyannis Port, Mass., where
he waited out the election re
turns. Kennedy received congrat
ulatory telegrams from Nixon
and Eisenhower. He then called
on all Americans to close ranks
in a supreme effort to meet the
"difficult and challenging years"
ahead.
Nixon, still smiling in defeat,
wired Kennedy congratulations
from Los Angeles before heading
back to Washington to assist in
the changeover of the govern
ment from Republican to Demo
cratic hands. Supporters arranged
a big welcome for the vice presi
dent.
KENNEDY'S victory made him
the youngest man and the first
Catholic to be elected to the
White House. He walked off with
the prize in a suspense-packed
finish which saw a record num
ber of Americans line up at the
polls.
Latest UPI returns gave Ken
nedy 23 states with 337 electoral
votes 68 more than he needed.
He also held a slim lead in an
other — New Mexico — with 4
votes. In Mississippi, which has
8 electoral votes, a group of un
pledged electors was declared the
winner.
Nixon won 24 states with 185
electoral votes and was leading in
one—Alaska with three votes.
His indicated final tally was 188.
At that point. Kennedy had 33.-
(151.811 popular votes and Nixon
32,861,983. The Democrat's share
was only 50.14 per cent of the
two-party total for a percentage
margin of 0.28 per cent.
That would be the smallest
popular vote margin in the his
tory of presidential elections
closer even than the 0.3 per cent
margin by which Democrat Glo
ver Cleveland beat James G.
Blaine in 1884.
Nixon's campaign manager.
Robert Finch, said the vice presi
dent might still capture the pop
ular vote despite losing the pay
off electoral vote, lie pinned his
hopes on rural votes in scattered
states and absentee ballots.
