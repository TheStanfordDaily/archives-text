# Poet Frost Talksâ€” About Work, Ideas
## 
### JUDY SEABORG 
Bright blue eyes peered shrewdly from beneath the bushy white
eyebrows as elderly poet Robert Frost thoughtfully considered his
work, his ideas, and his fellow-men in an interview yesterday after
noon.
Gesturing expressively with his short, thick hands, Frost remi-

nisced about his past. "I never
thought much about what I was
going to do. I've been on news
papers. as a reporter, editor, and
columnist and taught everything
but kindergarten."
HE ADDED that he has taught
subjects including mathematics,
Latin, history, literature, and Eng
lish in all types of schools rang
ing from rural to graduate.
Frost brushed aside the recent
election, stating that he is "not
interested" in the Kennedy wel
fare program. "It's not a new
thing. Both parties offered some
! of it to buy votes. The important
| thing was to decide who could
handle our relations with the
j world." He said the three things
| that were avoided in campaign
ing were Berlin, Cuba, and China,
and that he was "tired of waiting
to see what Khrushchev's going
j to do next."
OF HIS WRITING, Frost said,
"It's not a business; I never had
a desk. Things just come into
' your head. It's not regular.
"I read, think and farm," as
hobbies, he said. "I read every
j thing," adding that "I don't know
who's the biggest liar fiction or
! non-fiction."
Of literature, Frost prefers po
etry first, then short stories, then
| plays. "One of the sad things in
the world is that short stories
| aren't bought enough in book
| form," he added. "That's the best
reading there is short stories."
Frost considers Homer's "Odys
: sey" the best novel. "It's a pretty
shaped thing. The gratification is
perfect. Everybody's shot down
and blood runs.
"I I.IKK A straight crookedness
in writing," he said, comparing
il to a walking stick and a foot
ball run down the field. "That's
what takes brains. Some people
, call it shifty "
Frost deplored the fact that
| "our great magazines are occu
pied with sociological and politi
cal rather than literary articles.
I Are we all going in for good
works or good literature?" he
j asked. "The whole tendency of
! the world is to be taking care of
I the poor.
"I like somebody who doesn't
stick at trifles," said Frost. And
lie himself is above trifles. Those
that he treats arc seen in a pew
light; they cease to be trifles.
Shaking his wise old head slowly,
he pondered, "That's how I write
with a straight crookedness. Do
they like my poetry? They come
|to hear it." And what greater
' proof can there be?

POET ROBERT FROST IN INTERVIEW
Cave his ideas on literature and politics
Bright blue eyes peered shrewdly from beneath the bushy white
eyebrows as elderly poet Robert Frost thoughtfully considered his
work, his ideas, and his fellow-men in an interview yesterday after
noon.
Gesturing expressively with his short, thick hands, Frost remi-

nisced about his past. "I never
thought much about what I was
going to do. I've been on news
papers. as a reporter, editor, and
columnist and taught everything
but kindergarten."
HE ADDED that he has taught
subjects including mathematics,
Latin, history, literature, and Eng
lish in all types of schools rang
ing from rural to graduate.
Frost brushed aside the recent
election, stating that he is "not
interested" in the Kennedy wel
fare program. "It's not a new
thing. Both parties offered some
! of it to buy votes. The important
| thing was to decide who could
handle our relations with the
j world." He said the three things
| that were avoided in campaign
ing were Berlin, Cuba, and China,
and that he was "tired of waiting
to see what Khrushchev's going
j to do next."
OF HIS WRITING, Frost said,
"It's not a business; I never had
a desk. Things just come into
' your head. It's not regular.
"I read, think and farm," as
hobbies, he said. "I read every
j thing," adding that "I don't know
who's the biggest liar fiction or
! non-fiction."
Of literature, Frost prefers po
etry first, then short stories, then
| plays. "One of the sad things in
the world is that short stories
| aren't bought enough in book
| form," he added. "That's the best
reading there is short stories."
Frost considers Homer's "Odys
: sey" the best novel. "It's a pretty
