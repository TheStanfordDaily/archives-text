# LASSU
## No Stand On Peace Corps Plan 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Stanford's student legislature
last night refused to take a stand
on a resolution that it "endorse in
the principle" President-elect
John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps
proposal.
By a 15-8 vote, the LASSU
members decided to table the
motion a week and poll their con
stituents for their views on the
matter.
Kennedy's plan is to enroll
qualified young men and women
in a corps which would work in
underdeveloped countries need
ing technical assistance. Men in
the group would not be subject to
the draft in peacetime.
As proposed, the measure read:
"Resolved that Legislature en
dorse in the principle the 'Peace
Corps' as outlined in" Kennedy's
speech in San Francisco Nov. 3,
"and that Legislature give the
responsibility of organization of
campus support for the . . . Corps
to lIR, Political Union and The
Daily.
"THE POLITICAL Union will
handle campus education by
speakers, organizing letter writ
ing campaigns, and petitions, the
lIR ... to be a secretariat and
The Daily ... to handle publicity
and education."
Peter Erickson, speaking as
substitute for off-campus repre
sentative Tom Reilly, opposed the
corps as "absurd," and said the
plan merited "no consideration
whatsoever" by LASSU.
STERN rep Charles Lofgren
said the "whole idea is nebulous,"
and declared that if LASSU want
ed to refer a "minor issue" like
an integrated rooting section to
a student election, an issue such
as the Corps also should be sub
mitted to the electorate.
ASSU Financial Manager Todd
Stewart said the matter needed
more explanation and urged that
LASSU members talk the matter
over with their constituents.
SEVERAL me m be r s voiced
their approval of the Corps and
urged that the matter be voted
on immediately. Graduate School
of Business rep Bert Edwards and
AWS President Sheila Mac-Don
aid took LASSU to task for what
they termed its constant tabling
or postponement of issues.
In other action, LASSU unani
mously killed a motion carried
over from last week calling for
an integrated rooting section next
fall, so that the resolution would
not sound as if LASSU were ap
proving it.
