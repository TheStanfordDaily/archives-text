# Dangerous Thinking

Some people seem to think that Senator John I*. Kennedy's
victory is tantamount lo a victory for the Communists (see Steam
and Esteem).
Their fear is based on Russia's unrestrained happiness caused
by Senator Kennedy's election. The Russians are exceptionally
happy but il is for reasons much more complex than the fact that
Senator Kennedy supposedly represents another giant step toward
socialism.
Senator Kennedy's proposed program certainly does have some
"socialistic" tendencies, if we mean by "socialistic" more govern
ment participation in internal as well as external affairs. However,
such a tendency is by no means tantamount to a Communist victory
for several reasons.
The most important of these is that more government partici
pation could very possibly strengthen our position at home and
abroad. Senator Kennedy's New Frontier is a serious chalien
aimed at the Communists and they probably recognize it as such.
Communism thrives on our weaknesses. The New Frontier is
an attempt to rid ourselves of these weaknesses, thereby robbing
the Communists of their greatest weapon. If more government
participation is necessary to rid ourselves of these weaknesses, then
by all means let us have more government participation and
control.
Of course, by government control we don't mean usurpation
of individual rights. This would surely constitute a Communist
victory, but Senator Kennedy certainly does not intend to deprive
American citizens of their rights.
Another reason why Senator Kennedy's election does not con
stitute a Communist victory is that the President-elect abhors
Communism as much as any other American. He is aware of its
atrocities in the name of science and its hypocritical propaganda
program. As President of the United States, he is sworn to defend
and perpetuate our ideals and to combat tlie opposing ideals of
Communism.
Certainly the Communists know they are in for a battle and
can't be too gleeful to know that Senator Kennedy and his forces
are willing to accept the challenge much more so than was the
Eisenhower Administration, whose theory was wait and see, and
as we waited and saw the Communists moved.
\\ hv, then, are the Communists so happy? Perhaps the reason
is that the Communist exuberance is synthetic. It is probably in
the interests of the Communist movement to show the world that
they are happy with Senator Kennedy's election. If the Commu
nists did not greet Senator Kennedy's election with such exuber
ance, then the world might think they are worried.
)X hat would nations think if the Russians were completely
silent about Senator Kennedy's election? What would the nations
think if Senator Kennedy's election met with Russia's disapproval?
It would he natural to think that Russia considers the election
unfavorable to their cause.
This synthetic exuberance is just another propaganda gambit.
Khrushchev called on Kennedy to work "for the whole of man
kind which is longing for deliverance from the threat of a new
war." l itis is the same type of statement the Russians have been
making for decades, all the time working for the destruction of
the Western world.
It makes very little difference to the Communists as to whom
we choose as President. The Communists have a program and they
don't figure one man is going to stop it. Senator Kennedv with the
backing of the American people, however, makes the U.S. a for
midable opponent. It is essential to close ranks if we are to win.
Let's stop worrying so much about the ridiculous possibility of
usurpation of our rights from within by Senator Kennedy and start
worrying a little more about usurpation of our rights from the
real enemyâ€”Communism.
