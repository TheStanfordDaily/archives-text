Wednesday morning, which is
when this is being written, is
much too early for anyone to an
alyze and explain how it all hap
pened and why. The result is cer
tainly close enough to justify all
the anguish so publicly displayed
by Dr. Gallup and the other poll
sters who have to defy death and
destruction by crawling out to
the very end of the long distance
limb.
It will be some time before
even the most export of our cor
respondents will be able lo tell
us why, for example, religion
played so small a part in the
South, and how it is that the old
homelands of American progres
sivism in the Mississippi Valley
were so conservative.
But the post-mortems, I'asei
nsiting- and instructive as they are
sure lo be, do not alter the fact
that the outcome is decisive. Ken*
nedy is indisputably the presi
dent-elect. Alt hough the popular
vote was very close, the, closest,
1 believe, since the first election
of Grover Cleveland, there is
nothing ambiguous alMHit Ken
nedy's majority. Like Cleveland,
who was a strong president, lie
has a clear mandate to undertake
what he has promised lo do.
For myself, I believe that the
country is safer and that Ihe fu
ture is better because Kennedy
rather than Nixon won this close
contest. Had the result been re
versed, had Nixon won by a bare
majority, he would have come to
the White House under very
great handicaps. The Democratic
Party is overwhelmingly the
stronger of the American parties
at all levels of government.
The Democrats, of whom mil
lions followed Eisenhower, liked
Eisenhower and stood in awe of

his great personal popularity.
This enabled President Eisen
hower to work along with a
Democratic Congress. But there
was no chance that Nixon, could
have done the same. In the eyes
of too many Democrats he com
mitted too many unforgivable
wrongs by impugning the loyal
ty of their leaders. The magna
nimity and the charity of ihe
Democrats would have been
strained to the breaking point. A
narrow win by Nixon would have
inaugurated an era of severe po
litical, economic, and sectarian
bitterness.
Kennedy's win promises, on
the other hand, to bring on a
period of effective government.
For while the Democratic ma
jority in Congress are not united,
with Kennedy in the White
House, with Johnson as the vice
president, and with Sam Rayburn
as the speaker, the new Admin
istration will certainly be able to
form effective working majori
ties over and above the Demo
cratic reactionaries and obstruc
tionists.
For there is no reason why Ihe
coalition between Goldwater Re
publicans and the Byrd Demo
crats should not he topped by a
e o a 1 i Ii on of Kennedy-Johnson
Democrats and Rockefeller Re
publicans. For this reason hut
not I'or this reason alone, one of
Ihe striking phenomena of the
election has Iwen the popular
strength shown by the most en
lightened and liberal of file K"
publicans in Congress—notably
I John Sherman Cooper in Ken
! lucky, Clifford P. Case in New
Jersey, Margaret Chase Smith in
Maine, and l-everelt Saltonstall in
i Massachusetts.

inaugurated an era of severe po

For while the Democratic ma
jority in Congress are not united,
with Kennedy in the White
House, with Johnson as the vice
president, and with Sam Rayburn
as the speaker, the new Admin

form effective working majori

For there is no reason why Ihe

Wednesday morning, which is
when this is being written, is
much too early for anyone to an
alyze and explain how it all hap
pened and why. The result is cer
tainly close enough to justify all
the anguish so publicly displayed
by Dr. Gallup and the other poll
sters who have to defy death and
destruction by crawling out to
the very end of the long distance
limb.
It will be some time before
even the most export of our cor
respondents will be able lo tell
us why, for example, religion
played so small a part in the
South, and how it is that the old
homelands of American progres
sivism in the Mississippi Valley
were so conservative.
But the post-mortems, I'asei
nsiting- and instructive as they are
sure lo be, do not alter the fact
that the outcome is decisive. Ken*
nedy is indisputably the presi
dent-elect. Alt hough the popular
vote was very close, the, closest,
1 believe, since the first election
of Grover Cleveland, there is
nothing ambiguous alMHit Ken
nedy's majority. Like Cleveland,
who was a strong president, lie
has a clear mandate to undertake
what he has promised lo do.
For myself, I believe that the
country is safer and that Ihe fu
ture is better because Kennedy
rather than Nixon won this close
contest. Had the result been re
versed, had Nixon won by a bare
majority, he would have come to
the White House under very
great handicaps. The Democratic
Party is overwhelmingly the
stronger of the American parties
at all levels of government.
The Democrats, of whom mil
lions followed Eisenhower, liked
Eisenhower and stood in awe of

his great personal popularity.
This enabled President Eisen
hower to work along with a
Democratic Congress. But there
was no chance that Nixon, could
have done the same. In the eyes
of too many Democrats he com
mitted too many unforgivable
wrongs by impugning the loyal
ty of their leaders. The magna
nimity and the charity of ihe
Democrats would have been
strained to the breaking point. A
