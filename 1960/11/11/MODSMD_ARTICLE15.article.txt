! Editor, tlie Daily:
j Your statement that "Mr.
Nixon has been soundly beaten,
but not by the overwhelming ma
jority of the voters," is indeed
contradictory: a popular vote ra
tion of 50.28 per cent to 49.72 per
cent appears to be more a "skin
of-the-teeth'' victory than a
"sound beating." If Mr. Nixon
should, by some quirk, pull ahead
in the popular vote, would you
still be so eager to abolish the
Electoral College?
Elsewhere in the paper it says,
"Seldom in Soviet history had
Ihe press and radio applauded the
defeat of a U.S. presidential can
didate so gleefully, emotionally
and unrestrainedly." Doesn't it
give you cause ( and perhaps even
a little uneasinessi to wonder
why the Soviet Union is so en
thusiastic over a Kennedy vic
tory ?
