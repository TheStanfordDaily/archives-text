Re Mr. R. W. Lee's letter, it is
unfortunate that Milly Bennet
Amlie can no longer discuss the
subject of Chinese revolutions,
past or present, with any of us.
And she would he the first to
object to sloppy reporting—if it
were such not of the Daily staff,
but of her saddened friends who
immediately after her death on
Sunday gave them the story.
This was not intended as a

treatise on world politics, on Mrs.
Amlie's years of reporting, nor
even on the Chinese people for
whom she always had the great
est respect and admiration.
May I add only that Mrs. Amlie
early won and retained to the end
the friendship and admiration of
reputable American new s m en
everywhere for her courage, her
honesty and for her lifelong de
votion to American ideals til' de
mocracy and freedom.
