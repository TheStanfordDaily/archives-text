# Booters Face Cal Aggies, NBC This Weekend
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The Stanford hooters hope to
move back on the comeback trail
when 'they host the Cal Aggies
from Davis Saturday at 11:00 on
the varsity soccer field. Today
Stanford plays the University of
British Columbia at 2:30 on the
home field as a tuneup for to
morrow's all - important confer
ence game.
Saturday, as a preliminary to
the varsity game, at 9:30 the
junior varsity face Mission High
School on the varsity field. The
JV's are still undefeated and un
tied.
Against the Canadians. Stan
ford soccer coach Fred Priddle
figures on using his varsity in
the first half, and then giving
his junior varsity a chance to
play against top flight opposition
in the second half.
Right now, Stanford is tied for
the top spot in the West Coast
Soccer Conference along with
California and City College. If
the Indians intend to win the
championship and go to the
NCAA playoffs, they must defeat
the Aggies and California, who
are the onlv teams left on the

Stanford schedule. Stanford plays
Cal next week. »
The Aggies are a low-scoring
outfit, having scored only 10 goals
in five games. In contrast, Stan
ford's E m m a n ue 1 Andah has
scored 11 goals by himself in six
games. The Aggie defense is
tough, however, with, only 12
goals having been scored against
t hem.
This contrasts against Stan
ford's record of 30 goals scored
and 11 goals given up in six
games.
The Aggies are tough up the
middle, with the backbone of the
team being the Escardo brothers,
Enrique, Ralph and Hector. Hec
tor received all-league support
last year as an inside forward,
while Ralph was a starting half
back. This year, all three of them
are starting players.
Last week some of the Stan
ford starting v a rsi t y players
looked complacent, and to combat
this Coach Priddle has brought
junior varsity players I loiter and
Cormaek up to the varsity. Cor
mack is a forward-hall'back, and
Holler is a fullback.

The Aggies are a low-scoring
outfit, having scored only 10 goals
in five games. In contrast, Stan
ford's E m m a n ue 1 Andah has
scored 11 goals by himself in six
games. The Aggie defense is
tough, however, with, only 12
goals having been scored against
t hem.
This contrasts against Stan
ford's record of 30 goals scored
and 11 goals given up in six
games.
The Aggies are tough up the
middle, with the backbone of the
team being the Escardo brothers,
Enrique, Ralph and Hector. Hec
tor received all-league support
last year as an inside forward,
while Ralph was a starting half
back. This year, all three of them
are starting players.
Last week some of the Stan
ford starting v a rsi t y players
looked complacent, and to combat
this Coach Priddle has brought
junior varsity players I loiter and
Cormaek up to the varsity. Cor
mack is a forward-hall'back, and
Holler is a fullback.
The Stanford hooters hope to
move back on the comeback trail
when 'they host the Cal Aggies
from Davis Saturday at 11:00 on
the varsity soccer field. Today
Stanford plays the University of
British Columbia at 2:30 on the
home field as a tuneup for to
morrow's all - important confer
ence game.
Saturday, as a preliminary to
the varsity game, at 9:30 the
junior varsity face Mission High
School on the varsity field. The
JV's are still undefeated and un
tied.
Against the Canadians. Stan
ford soccer coach Fred Priddle
figures on using his varsity in
the first half, and then giving
his junior varsity a chance to
play against top flight opposition
in the second half.
Right now, Stanford is tied for
the top spot in the West Coast
Soccer Conference along with
California and City College. If
the Indians intend to win the
championship and go to the
NCAA playoffs, they must defeat
the Aggies and California, who
are the onlv teams left on the

Stanford schedule. Stanford plays
Cal next week. »
