### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford's water polo team
closes their season tomorrow
against the best as the Cards
tangle with the powerful Cali
fornia Rears at 10:00 in Ihe morn
ing at Berkeley.
The Bears ;ire easily the best
water polo squad on the eoast,
having beaten every team in the
Big Five and hav ing gone through
their schedule to date undefeated.
In the last meeting between the
two teams, the Blue and Gold
emerged easy 21-11 winners, but
Bear coach Bill Phillips played
his substitutes for half the con
test. and the score was not indica
tive of the relative abilities of
the two squads.
* Stanford has improved consid
erably since their first meeting
with the Bears, and the score
should be considerably closer,
although it would have to be con
sidered an upset if the Cards
were to win it.
Indicative of the Tribe water
poloists' improvement are their
scores against I SC and San Jose
State. After first losing to the
Trojans, 21-2, the Indians came
back and barely were edged. S-7,
in theii second contest.
Against San Jose State, Stan
ford first lost by a 17-0 score,
then bounced back for an S-7 win
after leading all the way.
The Indians have some stars
of their own, too.
Bob Norton is one. Every time
Lorton gets the ball, he is a threat
to score. Currently the Cards' No.
1 scorer with 30 goals, he is also
a top defensive player.
