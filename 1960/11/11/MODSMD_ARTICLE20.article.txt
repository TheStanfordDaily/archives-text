# Harriers 4th in SJS Meet
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
A -star-studded field ran away
from Stanford's youthful cross
country squad yesterday after
noon. The Indian harriers fin
ished fourlh in San Jose's invita
tional cross country meet.
SANTA ( LARA Youth Village,
led by La/.slo Tabori, the Hun
garian runner who finished fourth
in the 1956 Olympic 1500 meters,
dominated the competition. Five
Youth Village runners finished
among the top ten.
But the top individual man was
Cal's Alan Gaylord. Gaylord cov
ered the 4.3 mile course in the
record time of 2'): 10.5, breaking
Tabori's old record by 4..) sec
onds. Tabori was second.
Rich Klier topped the Stan
fordites, finishing in 7th place,
but he trailed Gaylord by almost
a minute. John Northway and
Bill Pratt took 14th and 15th posi
tions. respectively among the 41
runners in the field. Larry Shafer
finished 21st, while the fifth Card
runner, Robin Ruble, was 24th.
IN' THi; team scoring the
Youth Village won with 25 points

followed by California with 59,
San Jose, 78, Stanford, 81. San
Francisco Slate, lis, and Santa
Clara bringing up the rear.
The Stanford showing was
somewhat disappointing, in that
the team did not run well enough
as a group, with the later men
falling too far back. Perhaps the

explanation is that since this was
a rather unimportant race, the
runners were looking ahead to the
Big Meet with Cal on Tuesday.
But the harriers will have to stas
much closer to Gaylord and the
other Bear runners than they did
yesterday it they are going to
pull ol'f an upset.
