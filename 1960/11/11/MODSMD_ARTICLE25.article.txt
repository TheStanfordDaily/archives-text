# Distinguished Scientists Here In New Astronomy Institute
## 
### 
A new Radio Astronomy Insti
tute has been formed at Stanford
to implement an expanded re
search program in which distin
guished visiting scientists will
take part.
Experts from Japan and Aus
tralia already have made visits
Under Institute grants. It will sup
port a continuing group of such
visiting specialists who will aug
ment the Stanford research staff.
The Air Force Office of Scien
tific Research sponsors the In
stitute. Paul Johnson, of the
AFOSR Physics Division, was
j task scientist for the agency in
setting up the new organization.
Institute director is Professor
Ronald N. Bracewell, designer
builder of Stanford's unique 32-
| dish radio telescope now being
used for sunspot and solar bright
ness studies. With its unmatched
| resolving power, the big instru
ment has yielded important new
i observations of the moon and of
galactic and extra-galactic radio
i sources.
RESEARCH work employing
i the telescope will be increased,
j Dr. Bracewell said. Emphasis will
be on basic research in solar-ter
restrial physics, galactic radio
astronomy, radio interferometry,
j radiometry, and related areas.
Visitors so far include Aus
tralia's Stefan F. Smerd and
Japan's Takakiyo Kakinuma.
j Smerd, a staff member of the
' Radiophysics Laboratory of the
. Commonwealth Scientific and In
dustrial Research Organization in
Sydney, is coordinator for the
International Geophysical Year
| program of world-wide radio as
tronomy observations. Professor
Kakinuma is a member of the
Research Institute of Atmospher
i ic-s at Nagoya University.

Under Institute grants. It will sup
port a continuing group of such
visiting specialists who will aug
ment the Stanford research staff.
The Air Force Office of Scien
tific Research sponsors the In
stitute. Paul Johnson, of the
AFOSR Physics Division, was
j task scientist for the agency in
setting up the new organization.
Institute director is Professor
Ronald N. Bracewell, designer
builder of Stanford's unique 32-
| dish radio telescope now being
used for sunspot and solar bright
ness studies. With its unmatched
| resolving power, the big instru
ment has yielded important new
i observations of the moon and of
galactic and extra-galactic radio
i sources.
RESEARCH work employing
i the telescope will be increased,
j Dr. Bracewell said. Emphasis will
be on basic research in solar-ter
restrial physics, galactic radio
astronomy, radio interferometry,
j radiometry, and related areas.
Visitors so far include Aus
tralia's Stefan F. Smerd and
Japan's Takakiyo Kakinuma.
j Smerd, a staff member of the
' Radiophysics Laboratory of the
. Commonwealth Scientific and In
dustrial Research Organization in
Sydney, is coordinator for the
International Geophysical Year
| program of world-wide radio as
tronomy observations. Professor
Kakinuma is a member of the
Research Institute of Atmospher
i ic-s at Nagoya University.
An advisory committee of spe
: cialists from the Stanford Elec
tronics Laboratories and Radio
science Laboratory assists Dr.
Bracewell in administering the
Institute. Its members are Wil
| liam R. Rambo and Drs. David
IC. Bacon, Robert A. Helliwell,
