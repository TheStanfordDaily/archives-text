# Cards Host Beavers In Stadium
## 
### RUSS ALLEN 
STANFORD'S fool ball team
will ho out lo trap some Beavers
at 1:30 tomorrow, as Coach
Tommy Prothro brings his Ore
gon State club down to do battle
on the Farm.
The Tribe soundly whipped the
Beavers up north last year by a
39-22 score for their last football
win. Stanford will be out to gain
their first win of this season,
snap a nine-game losing streak
and increase their lead in the
OSC series.
Stanford currently leads in the
grid series with Oregon State
dating back to 1919 with 19
wins, 8 losses and 2 ties. However,
since Prothro took charge he has
beaten Stanford four out of five
games.
TOMORROW'S contest will see
Stanford's spread T offense pit
ted against the Beaver's hard
nosed, Red Sanders-style single
wing. It is surprising that each
team will use both a running and
passing attack to keep the oppo
sition defense guessing. Usually
Stanford is counted on to fill the
air with pigskins while OSC is
expected to grind out their yards
on the ground.
However, with Skip Face, Gil
Dowd and Hal Steuber breaking
through good holes in the line for
Stanford, and Terry Baker throw
ing to ends Aaron Thomas or
Amos Marsh, fans tomorrow will
certainly be treated to a varied,
multiple offense show.
Oregon State goes into tomor
row's contest a ten-point favorite
over the Cards. This comes on im
pressive wins over SC, Indiana,
Houston, Idaho and WSU. The
Beavers also dropped two close
ones to lowa and Washington—
both ranked in the top ten nation
ally.
OSC WILL field a slightly
different type of team this year.
No longer do they specialize in
big, fast tackles like John Witte
and Ted Bates—both Ail-Ameri
cans a couple of years ago—and
plunging backs like Nub Beamer
and Joe Francis—who have de
moralized S t a n 112 or d defensive
men on several occasions.
This year the team is built
around the throwing and off
tackle sweeps of tailback Baker,
currently the nation's total of
fense leader with 1,353 total yards
from running and passing. The
two ends Thomas and Marsh—
are both under 10 seconds in the
hundred-yard dash and both are
used for that long pass play.
Also because of the lack of
depth in the interior line, Oregon
State cannot rely as heavily in
the slow-developing plays such as
the wingback reverse which also
has plagued the Tribe.
ON THE INDIAN side. Dick
Norman will do a lot of passing
tomorrow to ends Stove Pursell
and Dale Ostrander as well as to
backs Mac Wylie, I)owd or Face.
Oregon State usually has an
nual pass defense problems and
this year the Indians will cer
tainly want to capitalize on them.
The Indians will also mix up the
passing with a running attack
which saw improvement in last
weekend's loss to Oregon.
Oregon State should slart
Marsh and Thomas at ends both
are around 200 pounds; Neil
Plumley. 231 and Mike Kline. 230,
at tackles; Ross Cariaga and
Denny Pieters at guards; captain
Doug Bashor at center; Marne
Palmateer at quarter or blocking
back; Gene Milliard at left or
wingback; Baker at tailback and
Ilank Rivera at fullback.
THE INDIAN starting lineup
includes: Ostrander and Pursell
at ends; co-captain Dean Ilinshaw
and Phil Toorvald at tackles;
Tom Walsh and Don Peter at the
guard spots; Chris Cottle at cen
ter; Norman at quarterback;
Dowd and VVylie at halfbacks and
Face at fullback.

row's contest a ten-point favorite
over the Cards. This comes on im
pressive wins over SC, Indiana,
Houston, Idaho and WSU. The
Beavers also dropped two close
ones to lowa and Washington—
both ranked in the top ten nation
ally.
OSC WILL field a slightly
different type of team this year.
No longer do they specialize in
big, fast tackles like John Witte
and Ted Bates—both Ail-Ameri
cans a couple of years ago—and
plunging backs like Nub Beamer
and Joe Francis—who have de
moralized S t a n 112 or d defensive
men on several occasions.
This year the team is built
around the throwing and off
tackle sweeps of tailback Baker,
currently the nation's total of
fense leader with 1,353 total yards
from running and passing. The
two ends Thomas and Marsh—
are both under 10 seconds in the
hundred-yard dash and both are
used for that long pass play.
Also because of the lack of
depth in the interior line, Oregon
State cannot rely as heavily in
the slow-developing plays such as
the wingback reverse which also
has plagued the Tribe.
ON THE INDIAN side. Dick
Norman will do a lot of passing
tomorrow to ends Stove Pursell
and Dale Ostrander as well as to
backs Mac Wylie, I)owd or Face.
Oregon State usually has an
nual pass defense problems and
this year the Indians will cer
tainly want to capitalize on them.
The Indians will also mix up the
passing with a running attack
which saw improvement in last
weekend's loss to Oregon.
Oregon State should slart
Marsh and Thomas at ends both
are around 200 pounds; Neil
Plumley. 231 and Mike Kline. 230,
at tackles; Ross Cariaga and
Denny Pieters at guards; captain
Doug Bashor at center; Marne
Palmateer at quarter or blocking
back; Gene Milliard at left or
wingback; Baker at tailback and
Ilank Rivera at fullback.
THE INDIAN starting lineup
includes: Ostrander and Pursell
at ends; co-captain Dean Ilinshaw
and Phil Toorvald at tackles;
Tom Walsh and Don Peter at the
guard spots; Chris Cottle at cen

Dowd and VVylie at halfbacks and
Face at fullback.
STANFORD'S fool ball team
will ho out lo trap some Beavers
at 1:30 tomorrow, as Coach
Tommy Prothro brings his Ore
gon State club down to do battle
on the Farm.
The Tribe soundly whipped the
Beavers up north last year by a
39-22 score for their last football
win. Stanford will be out to gain
their first win of this season,
snap a nine-game losing streak
and increase their lead in the
OSC series.
Stanford currently leads in the
grid series with Oregon State
dating back to 1919 with 19
wins, 8 losses and 2 ties. However,
since Prothro took charge he has
beaten Stanford four out of five
games.
TOMORROW'S contest will see
Stanford's spread T offense pit
ted against the Beaver's hard
nosed, Red Sanders-style single
wing. It is surprising that each
team will use both a running and
passing attack to keep the oppo
sition defense guessing. Usually
Stanford is counted on to fill the
air with pigskins while OSC is
expected to grind out their yards
on the ground.
However, with Skip Face, Gil
Dowd and Hal Steuber breaking
through good holes in the line for
Stanford, and Terry Baker throw

certainly be treated to a varied,
multiple offense show.

tainly want to capitalize on them.
The Indians will also mix up the
passing with a running attack
which saw improvement in last
weekend's loss to Oregon.

STANFORD'S fool ball team
will ho out lo trap some Beavers
at 1:30 tomorrow, as Coach
Tommy Prothro brings his Ore
gon State club down to do battle
on the Farm.
The Tribe soundly whipped the
Beavers up north last year by a
39-22 score for their last football
win. Stanford will be out to gain
their first win of this season,
snap a nine-game losing streak
and increase their lead in the
OSC series.
Stanford currently leads in the
grid series with Oregon State
dating back to 1919 with 19
wins, 8 losses and 2 ties. However,
since Prothro took charge he has
beaten Stanford four out of five
games.
TOMORROW'S contest will see
Stanford's spread T offense pit
ted against the Beaver's hard
nosed, Red Sanders-style single
wing. It is surprising that each
team will use both a running and
passing attack to keep the oppo
sition defense guessing. Usually
Stanford is counted on to fill the
air with pigskins while OSC is
expected to grind out their yards
on the ground.
However, with Skip Face, Gil
Dowd and Hal Steuber breaking
through good holes in the line for
Stanford, and Terry Baker throw
ing to ends Aaron Thomas or
Amos Marsh, fans tomorrow will
certainly be treated to a varied,
multiple offense show.
Oregon State goes into tomor
row's contest a ten-point favorite
over the Cards. This comes on im
pressive wins over SC, Indiana,
Houston, Idaho and WSU. The
Beavers also dropped two close
ones to lowa and Washington—
both ranked in the top ten nation
ally.
OSC WILL field a slightly
different type of team this year.
No longer do they specialize in
big, fast tackles like John Witte
and Ted Bates—both Ail-Ameri
cans a couple of years ago—and
plunging backs like Nub Beamer
and Joe Francis—who have de
moralized S t a n 112 or d defensive
men on several occasions.
This year the team is built
around the throwing and off
tackle sweeps of tailback Baker,
currently the nation's total of
fense leader with 1,353 total yards
from running and passing. The
two ends Thomas and Marsh—
are both under 10 seconds in the
hundred-yard dash and both are
used for that long pass play.
Also because of the lack of
depth in the interior line, Oregon
State cannot rely as heavily in
the slow-developing plays such as
the wingback reverse which also
has plagued the Tribe.
ON THE INDIAN side. Dick
Norman will do a lot of passing
tomorrow to ends Stove Pursell
and Dale Ostrander as well as to
backs Mac Wylie, I)owd or Face.
