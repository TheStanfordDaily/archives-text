# Daily Entertainment Issue Out Monday
## 
### 
Something new will be added to Big Game Week this year
when The Daily adds to its regular four-page Monday edition
an eight-page supplement dealing with entertainment on the
Peninsula and in San Francisco.
The supplement will replace the traditional Big Game issue,
and has been worked on since early June. Planning for the spe
cial issue began last April.
The supplement will deal with all phases of entertainment in
the City and on the Peninsula, from art galleries to North Beach.
INCLUDED AKE special stories on restaurants, theaters,
music, little theater groups, foreign film theaters, jazz joints and
so on.
The supplement is designed to give the Stanford undergrad
uate a handy, comprehensive guide to the entertainment avail
able to him or her in the entertainment-rich San Francisco area.
Daily readers will find it useful to save the issue for future
reference as to what is available in the area, and when and
where it can be found.
For the special edition, The Daily is increasing its regular
press run of 9.500 to 11,000.
While The Daily would have liked to publish the usual Big
Game issue in addition to the entertainment supplement, finan
cial necessity made only one special fall-quarter issue possible.
WHITING FOR THE issue was handled entirely by staff
members, although opinions of authorities and critics in the
area appear in several stories.
Associate Editor Mary Lou MeKtnlcy and Staff Editor Sherry
Welch edited the supplement, aided by Night Editor Frances
Fisher and Photography Editor Frank flamill.
The issue will be inserted inside all Dailies Monday and will
be free.
