## 'Gaieties' Crew Keeps Show 'On the Boards' 
### KATHEE DOWNING 
While "Gaieties's" pagentry unfolds before the audience, stage
crews work feverously to keep the show rolling. Production next
week will culminate weeks of work for both actors and crew of
Ram's Head Big Game show.
Planning for "Gaieties" began a year ago with the drafting of

scripts and plotting of stage sets.
Time schedules were optimisti
cally set. To meet that schedule,
Terry Sandke, technical director,
put the construction crew to work
: two weeks before fall quarter.
They've been pounding nails
every night for three months.
SINCE the close of "Much Ado
I. . last week, Ken Vesey and
| the lighting crew have been hang
ing from the rafters placing more
than 50 lights for the show. Paint
ers and carpenters, under the di
rection of Judy Patt, set designer,
and Dick Prael, assistant con
struction head, have been adding
i globs of paint and half-sawed
| boards to the maze of wiring on
'the stage.
Other crews also hang from
the ceiling to accomplish their
job. Fly crew, under Bob Glork,
; has been placing backdrop cur
| tains which arc lowered at appro
priate moments. Pete Groom,
Stage Manager, is responsible for
organizing all t he s e technical
moves into a "smooth show."
TO THE audiences for the No
| vember 15-18 performances, none
of the necessary confusion will
i be evident. More than :">() dancers,
singers, and actors will present
16 skits spoofing sacred Stanford
institutions. The expose of the
Health Service is one of the skits
which Director Jim Gleason prom
ises will be funnier than real life.

gins at 9:30 p.m. after the bon
fire. Tickets for $2, $1.50 and $1
