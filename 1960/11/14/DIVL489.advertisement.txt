Zeroing in on the future
At Gen Tel, our aim is to develop the supercommunica
tions system that will be needed to meet the demands
of tomorrow. And we're constantly shooting new ideas
at this target.
In our 24 research laboratories, more than 3500 scien
tists and engineers have their sights set on entirely
new concepts in order to achieve these results.
C..\ Example: a task force of General Telephone & Elec
fjf'V tronics scientists, working in the unexplored areas of
electroluminescence and photoconductivity, have
