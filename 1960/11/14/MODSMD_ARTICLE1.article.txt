# IT'S BIG GAME WEEK!
## Referee's Flag Hands Indians Ninth Defeat 
### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
For a moment, for an agoniz
ingly short-but beautiful moment,
it looked like Stanford was going
to win its first football game of
1 ho season and end a nine-game
losing streak. A referee had other
ideas, and it was the toss of his
red handkerchief that gave Ore
gon State a 25-21 victory over
the Indians in the Stadium Sat
urday.
The penalty came when Dick
Norman flipped a long pitchout
to Skip Face with 1 minute and
58 seconds left to play in the
game. Skip was far away from
any Oregon State defender-sand
loafed into the end zone for the
score that would have put the
Indians ahead.
NORMAN started jumping up
and down with joy like a kid on
a pogo stick. The 7.500 fans who
braved a hard wind-driven rain
let loose with a roar. Even the
usually staid members of the
press got caught up in the ecstacy
of the thought that Stanford was
going to win a football game.
Then somebody saw the handker
chief.
"Number 79 (co-captain Dean
Hinshaw) was clipping." said
referee Edward Wagner after the
game. "Two officials called the
play. He committed the foul be
fore Face crossed the goal line.
If it had been after the score
Stanford would have been pen
alized on the kickoff."-
After viewing the films of the
game in the BAC yesterday, Stan
ford Coach Jack Curtice said that
the penalty call had probably
been a good one.
CURTICE said that it was a
hard call for an official to make
and that the infraction certainly
had no effect on the play. Hin
shaw had dived at OSC halfback
Bob Lazark and apparently had
hit La/ark in the heel with his
head. Lazark went down and two
officials signaled the penalty.
One of them was shown in the
films to be signalling a touch
down with one hand and throw
ing his handkerchief with the
other.
As the game ended a flurry of
fist fights broke out on the field
and the benches of both teams
emptied in a hurry. Things set
tled down quickly, however, as
soon as some of the steam had
been let off.
In all the fuss about the pen
alty the fact that Dick Norman
became the greatest passer in
Stanford history was almost over
looked. Midway through the
fourth period, during the drive
that led to the ealled-baek touch
down. in fact, Norman dropped
back to pass. He started being
chased all over the back field by
some Beaver defenders and then
spotted end Dale Ostrander
downfield.
THE ONLY WAV he could get
rid of the ball was to throw left-

BEAVER BACK IN TROUBLE
Tailback Terry Baker is stopped by Dean Hinshaw
handed, and with this desperation
effort Dick Norman gained his
3,600th yard in the air to break
John Brodie's career passing rec
ord of 3,594.
Stanford halfback Oil Dowd
had the best day of his life Sat
urday as he toted the pigskin 20
times for 98 yards and several
crucial gainers.
But. the big gun in the game
and the decider of the outcome,
if you can forget about penalties
for a minute, was Oregon State
tailback Don Kasso.
KASSO, WHO has been under
studying for sophomore Terry
Baker all year, came storming
back into action after an early
season injury in great form.
He carried the ball 22 times
for 139 yards and scored two
touchdowns on runs of 12 and
10 yards.
The Beavers opened the scoring
in the first quarter when Baker
dropped back to pass, couldn't
find a receiver but found a hole
up the middle of the Stanford
line instead and charged through
for nine yards and the score.
tiii: tribe came back into
the game just before the quarter
ended on what has to be the best
run of the year by a Stanford
player. Norman hit Face with a
pass on the OSC 40-yard line and
He got tangled up with his
blocker, got loose, let the blocker
take one of the men in his way
and outran the other one into the
end zone. The play was good for
56 yards.
In the second period Dowd took
a pitehout and went into the end
zone around his own right end
for another Stanford score. Face
kicked the extra point and the
Indians led 14-7. It was the first
time Stanford had led an oppo
nent since the second game of the
season against Wisconsin.
Oregon State scored four min

utes later on a reverse by Gene
Hi 11 i a r d good for 29 yards.
Baker tried to pass the extra
point but threw short after run
ning around in the backfield
looking for someone to throw to.
The Indians led 14-13 and a rain
bow appeared behind the Stan
ford rooting section which started
yelling. "Glorious upset."
EARLY IX the third quarter
Norman hit Face with an 11-yard
touchdown pass to put the Tribe

even further in front. Skip took
the pass over his shoulder with
out breaking stride just as he
crossed the goal line.
Then Kasso took over. With a
little less than six minutes left
in the third period the Beaver
tailback went around his left end
for a 12-yard scoring run and
then at about the same time in
the final period Kasso went
through left tackle, cut hard to
the right and scrambled into the

into Ihe end /one for a 16-yard
tally. Kasso tried around his
right end for the two-point con
version but was hit by Face on
tho one-yard line.
THE BEAVERS led 25-21 with
6:36 seconds left in the game.
The Tribe started from scrim
mage on their own 28 and moved
down field to Face's touchdown,
Hinshaw's infraction, the ref
eree's flag and their ninth loss
of the year.

Tailback Terry Baker is stopped by Dean Hinshaw
handed, and with this desperation
effort Dick Norman gained his
3,600th yard in the air to break
John Brodie's career passing rec

Stanford halfback Oil Dowd
had the best day of his life Sat
urday as he toted the pigskin 20
times for 98 yards and several
crucial gainers.
But. the big gun in the game
and the decider of the outcome,
if you can forget about penalties
for a minute, was Oregon State
tailback Don Kasso.
KASSO, WHO has been under
studying for sophomore Terry
Baker all year, came storming
back into action after an early
season injury in great form.
He carried the ball 22 times
for 139 yards and scored two
touchdowns on runs of 12 and
10 yards.
The Beavers opened the scoring
in the first quarter when Baker
dropped back to pass, couldn't
find a receiver but found a hole
up the middle of the Stanford
line instead and charged through
for nine yards and the score.
tiii: tribe came back into
the game just before the quarter
ended on what has to be the best
run of the year by a Stanford
player. Norman hit Face with a
pass on the OSC 40-yard line and
He got tangled up with his
blocker, got loose, let the blocker
take one of the men in his way
and outran the other one into the
end zone. The play was good for
56 yards.
In the second period Dowd took
a pitehout and went into the end
zone around his own right end
for another Stanford score. Face
kicked the extra point and the
Indians led 14-7. It was the first
time Stanford had led an oppo
nent since the second game of the
season against Wisconsin.
Oregon State scored four min

utes later on a reverse by Gene
Hi 11 i a r d good for 29 yards.
Baker tried to pass the extra
point but threw short after run
ning around in the backfield
looking for someone to throw to.
The Indians led 14-13 and a rain
bow appeared behind the Stan
ford rooting section which started
yelling. "Glorious upset."
EARLY IX the third quarter
Norman hit Face with an 11-yard
touchdown pass to put the Tribe

even further in front. Skip took
the pass over his shoulder with
out breaking stride just as he
crossed the goal line.
Then Kasso took over. With a
little less than six minutes left
in the third period the Beaver
tailback went around his left end
for a 12-yard scoring run and
then at about the same time in
the final period Kasso went
through left tackle, cut hard to
the right and scrambled into the

into Ihe end /one for a 16-yard
tally. Kasso tried around his
right end for the two-point con
version but was hit by Face on
tho one-yard line.
THE BEAVERS led 25-21 with
6:36 seconds left in the game.
The Tribe started from scrim
mage on their own 28 and moved
down field to Face's touchdown,
Hinshaw's infraction, the ref
eree's flag and their ninth loss
of the year.

For a moment, for an agoniz

red handkerchief that gave Ore
gon State a 25-21 victory over
the Indians in the Stadium Sat

The penalty came when Dick
Norman flipped a long pitchout
to Skip Face with 1 minute and
58 seconds left to play in the
game. Skip was far away from
any Oregon State defender-sand
loafed into the end zone for the
score that would have put the
Indians ahead.
NORMAN started jumping up
and down with joy like a kid on
a pogo stick. The 7.500 fans who

ford Coach Jack Curtice said that
the penalty call had probably
been a good one.
CURTICE said that it was a
hard call for an official to make
and that the infraction certainly
had no effect on the play. Hin
shaw had dived at OSC halfback
Bob Lazark and apparently had
hit La/ark in the heel with his
head. Lazark went down and two
officials signaled the penalty.
One of them was shown in the
films to be signalling a touch
down with one hand and throw
ing his handkerchief with the
other.
As the game ended a flurry of
fist fights broke out on the field
and the benches of both teams
emptied in a hurry. Things set
tled down quickly, however, as
soon as some of the steam had
been let off.
In all the fuss about the pen
alty the fact that Dick Norman
became the greatest passer in
Stanford history was almost over
looked. Midway through the
fourth period, during the drive
that led to the ealled-baek touch
down. in fact, Norman dropped
back to pass. He started being
chased all over the back field by
some Beaver defenders and then
spotted end Dale Ostrander
downfield.
THE ONLY WAV he could get
rid of the ball was to throw left-

BEAVER BACK IN TROUBLE
Tailback Terry Baker is stopped by Dean Hinshaw
handed, and with this desperation
effort Dick Norman gained his
3,600th yard in the air to break
John Brodie's career passing rec
ord of 3,594.
Stanford halfback Oil Dowd
had the best day of his life Sat
urday as he toted the pigskin 20
times for 98 yards and several
crucial gainers.
But. the big gun in the game
and the decider of the outcome,
if you can forget about penalties
for a minute, was Oregon State
tailback Don Kasso.
KASSO, WHO has been under
studying for sophomore Terry
Baker all year, came storming
back into action after an early
season injury in great form.
He carried the ball 22 times
for 139 yards and scored two
touchdowns on runs of 12 and
10 yards.
The Beavers opened the scoring
in the first quarter when Baker
dropped back to pass, couldn't
find a receiver but found a hole
up the middle of the Stanford
line instead and charged through
for nine yards and the score.
tiii: tribe came back into
the game just before the quarter
ended on what has to be the best
run of the year by a Stanford
player. Norman hit Face with a
pass on the OSC 40-yard line and
He got tangled up with his
blocker, got loose, let the blocker
take one of the men in his way
and outran the other one into the
end zone. The play was good for
56 yards.
In the second period Dowd took
a pitehout and went into the end
zone around his own right end
for another Stanford score. Face
kicked the extra point and the
Indians led 14-7. It was the first
time Stanford had led an oppo
nent since the second game of the
season against Wisconsin.
Oregon State scored four min

utes later on a reverse by Gene
Hi 11 i a r d good for 29 yards.
Baker tried to pass the extra
point but threw short after run
ning around in the backfield
looking for someone to throw to.
The Indians led 14-13 and a rain
bow appeared behind the Stan
ford rooting section which started
yelling. "Glorious upset."
EARLY IX the third quarter
Norman hit Face with an 11-yard
touchdown pass to put the Tribe

even further in front. Skip took
the pass over his shoulder with
out breaking stride just as he
crossed the goal line.
Then Kasso took over. With a
little less than six minutes left
in the third period the Beaver
tailback went around his left end
for a 12-yard scoring run and
then at about the same time in
the final period Kasso went
through left tackle, cut hard to
the right and scrambled into the

into Ihe end /one for a 16-yard
tally. Kasso tried around his
right end for the two-point con
version but was hit by Face on
tho one-yard line.
THE BEAVERS led 25-21 with
6:36 seconds left in the game.
The Tribe started from scrim
mage on their own 28 and moved
down field to Face's touchdown,
Hinshaw's infraction, the ref
eree's flag and their ninth loss
of the year.

Skip Face returns from what he thought was winning TD
For a moment, for an agoniz
ingly short-but beautiful moment,
it looked like Stanford was going
to win its first football game of
1 ho season and end a nine-game
losing streak. A referee had other
ideas, and it was the toss of his
red handkerchief that gave Ore
gon State a 25-21 victory over
the Indians in the Stadium Sat
urday.
The penalty came when Dick
Norman flipped a long pitchout
to Skip Face with 1 minute and
58 seconds left to play in the
game. Skip was far away from
any Oregon State defender-sand
loafed into the end zone for the
score that would have put the
Indians ahead.
NORMAN started jumping up
and down with joy like a kid on
a pogo stick. The 7.500 fans who
braved a hard wind-driven rain
let loose with a roar. Even the
usually staid members of the
press got caught up in the ecstacy
of the thought that Stanford was
going to win a football game.
Then somebody saw the handker
chief.
"Number 79 (co-captain Dean
Hinshaw) was clipping." said
referee Edward Wagner after the
game. "Two officials called the
play. He committed the foul be
fore Face crossed the goal line.

BEAVER BACK IN TROUBLE
Tailback Terry Baker is stopped by Dean Hinshaw
handed, and with this desperation
effort Dick Norman gained his
3,600th yard in the air to break
John Brodie's career passing rec
ord of 3,594.
Stanford halfback Oil Dowd
had the best day of his life Sat
urday as he toted the pigskin 20
times for 98 yards and several
crucial gainers.
But. the big gun in the game
and the decider of the outcome,
if you can forget about penalties
for a minute, was Oregon State
tailback Don Kasso.
KASSO, WHO has been under
studying for sophomore Terry
Baker all year, came storming
back into action after an early
season injury in great form.
He carried the ball 22 times
for 139 yards and scored two
touchdowns on runs of 12 and
10 yards.
The Beavers opened the scoring
in the first quarter when Baker
dropped back to pass, couldn't
find a receiver but found a hole
up the middle of the Stanford
line instead and charged through
for nine yards and the score.
tiii: tribe came back into
the game just before the quarter
ended on what has to be the best
run of the year by a Stanford
player. Norman hit Face with a
pass on the OSC 40-yard line and
He got tangled up with his
blocker, got loose, let the blocker
take one of the men in his way
and outran the other one into the
end zone. The play was good for
56 yards.
In the second period Dowd took
a pitehout and went into the end
zone around his own right end
for another Stanford score. Face
kicked the extra point and the
Indians led 14-7. It was the first
time Stanford had led an oppo
nent since the second game of the
season against Wisconsin.
Oregon State scored four min

utes later on a reverse by Gene
Hi 11 i a r d good for 29 yards.
Baker tried to pass the extra
point but threw short after run
ning around in the backfield
looking for someone to throw to.
The Indians led 14-13 and a rain
bow appeared behind the Stan
ford rooting section which started
yelling. "Glorious upset."
EARLY IX the third quarter
Norman hit Face with an 11-yard
touchdown pass to put the Tribe

even further in front. Skip took
the pass over his shoulder with
out breaking stride just as he
crossed the goal line.
Then Kasso took over. With a
little less than six minutes left
in the third period the Beaver
tailback went around his left end
for a 12-yard scoring run and
then at about the same time in
the final period Kasso went
through left tackle, cut hard to
the right and scrambled into the

into Ihe end /one for a 16-yard
tally. Kasso tried around his
right end for the two-point con
version but was hit by Face on
tho one-yard line.
THE BEAVERS led 25-21 with
6:36 seconds left in the game.
The Tribe started from scrim
mage on their own 28 and moved
down field to Face's touchdown,
Hinshaw's infraction, the ref
eree's flag and their ninth loss
of the year.


THE INDIANS THOUCHT THEY HAD IT WON
Skip Face returns from what he thought was winning TD
For a moment, for an agoniz
ingly short-but beautiful moment,
it looked like Stanford was going
to win its first football game of
1 ho season and end a nine-game
losing streak. A referee had other
ideas, and it was the toss of his
red handkerchief that gave Ore
gon State a 25-21 victory over
the Indians in the Stadium Sat
urday.
The penalty came when Dick
Norman flipped a long pitchout
to Skip Face with 1 minute and
58 seconds left to play in the
game. Skip was far away from
any Oregon State defender-sand
loafed into the end zone for the
score that would have put the
Indians ahead.
NORMAN started jumping up
and down with joy like a kid on
a pogo stick. The 7.500 fans who
braved a hard wind-driven rain
let loose with a roar. Even the
usually staid members of the
press got caught up in the ecstacy
of the thought that Stanford was
going to win a football game.
Then somebody saw the handker
chief.
"Number 79 (co-captain Dean
Hinshaw) was clipping." said
referee Edward Wagner after the
game. "Two officials called the
play. He committed the foul be
fore Face crossed the goal line.
If it had been after the score
Stanford would have been pen
alized on the kickoff."-
After viewing the films of the
game in the BAC yesterday, Stan
ford Coach Jack Curtice said that
the penalty call had probably
been a good one.
CURTICE said that it was a
hard call for an official to make
and that the infraction certainly
had no effect on the play. Hin
shaw had dived at OSC halfback
Bob Lazark and apparently had
hit La/ark in the heel with his
head. Lazark went down and two
officials signaled the penalty.
One of them was shown in the
films to be signalling a touch
down with one hand and throw
ing his handkerchief with the
other.
As the game ended a flurry of
fist fights broke out on the field
and the benches of both teams
emptied in a hurry. Things set
tled down quickly, however, as
soon as some of the steam had
been let off.
In all the fuss about the pen
alty the fact that Dick Norman
