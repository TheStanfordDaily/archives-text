# IT'S BIG GAME WEEK!
## Referee's Flag Hands Indians Ninth Defeat 
### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
For a moment, for an agoniz
ingly short-but beautiful moment,
it looked like Stanford was going
to win its first football game of
1 ho season and end a nine-game
losing streak. A referee had other
ideas, and it was the toss of his
red handkerchief that gave Ore
gon State a 25-21 victory over
the Indians in the Stadium Sat
urday.
The penalty came when Dick
Norman flipped a long pitchout
to Skip Face with 1 minute and
58 seconds left to play in the
game. Skip was far away from
any Oregon State defender-sand
loafed into the end zone for the
score that would have put the
Indians ahead.
NORMAN started jumping up
and down with joy like a kid on
a pogo stick. The 7.500 fans who
braved a hard wind-driven rain
let loose with a roar. Even the
usually staid members of the
press got caught up in the ecstacy
of the thought that Stanford was
going to win a football game.
Then somebody saw the handker
chief.
"Number 79 (co-captain Dean
Hinshaw) was clipping." said
referee Edward Wagner after the
game. "Two officials called the
play. He committed the foul be
fore Face crossed the goal line.
If it had been after the score
Stanford would have been pen
alized on the kickoff."-
After viewing the films of the
game in the BAC yesterday, Stan
ford Coach Jack Curtice said that
the penalty call had probably
been a good one.
CURTICE said that it was a
hard call for an official to make
and that the infraction certainly
had no effect on the play. Hin
shaw had dived at OSC halfback
Bob Lazark and apparently had
hit La/ark in the heel with his
head. Lazark went down and two
officials signaled the penalty.
One of them was shown in the
films to be signalling a touch
down with one hand and throw
ing his handkerchief with the
other.
As the game ended a flurry of
fist fights broke out on the field
and the benches of both teams
emptied in a hurry. Things set
tled down quickly, however, as
soon as some of the steam had
been let off.
In all the fuss about the pen
alty the fact that Dick Norman
became the greatest passer in
Stanford history was almost over
looked. Midway through the
fourth period, during the drive
that led to the ealled-baek touch
down. in fact, Norman dropped
back to pass. He started being
chased all over the back field by
some Beaver defenders and then
spotted end Dale Ostrander
downfield.
THE ONLY WAV he could get
rid of the ball was to throw left-
