# For Constituents
## 
### 
Last Thursday night, Legislature refused to "endorse in the
principle'" President-elect John F. Kennedy's Peace Corps pro
posal. The endorsement was tabled because the representatives'
constituents knew very little of the Peace Corps and the representa
tives felt they should not endorse anything in principle or other
wise until the constituents knew what it was all about.
However, it was discovered that very few members of LASSU
knew anything about the Peace Corps either, therefore making it
somewhat difficult for them to educate their constituents.
The editorial page is devoted today to information concerning
the Peace Corps. The Bill introduced by Senator Hubert Humph
rey which, in essence, is Senator Kennedy's proposal, is, in part,
reproduced. Because of its great length, the entire Bill is not re
produced. However, the most important areas of the Bill, the es
tablishment and purpose of the Corps, are given.
A discussion between Senator Humphrey and Senator illiam
Proxmire in Congress on June 15 is also reproduced in part. Cer
tain of Senator Proxmire's questions are covered in the Bill and
are left out of the discussion portion.
Many feel that the Peace Corps would be ideal for draft dodg
ers. Both the Bill and the Humphrey-Proxinire discussion indi
cate numerous reasons why draft dodgers would be discouraged
rather encouraged.
