MR. PROXIMIRE: "Mr. Presi
dent, will the Senator yield?"
MR. HUMPHREY: "I yield."
MR. PROXMIRE: "This is an
excellent proposal. It is construc
tive. I should like to ask the Sen
ator from Minnesota some ques
tions in regard to the proposal. I
think it raises some interesting
questions.
"As I understand the proposal,
it would provide an alternative
for a very few carefully selected
young men, who would be other
wise subject to the draft, who
would be enabled to serve for a
period of time instead in the For
eign Service of the United States.
Is that correct?"
MR. HUMPHREY: "Only for
peacetime service. It would not
exclude anyone from military
service in case of national emer
gency or in case of hostilities, nor
would it exclude anyone from Re
serve requirements."
MR. PROXMIRE: "Would the
Senator from Minnesota mind re
peating what are the provisions
which would prevent this propo
sal from becoming an oppor
tunity for young people to dodge
the draft, to obtain a softer serv
ice and escape their obligations
to their countrv?"
MR. HUMPHREY: "Yes, in
deed. I shall read from the de
scription of the bill.
"First, I point out that there Is
a 3-year term of service in the
Peace Corps, instead of the nor
mal 2 years for the Army.
"The participants would be lia
ble for the provisions of the Selec
tive Service in time of war or in
time of national emergency. Like
wise, they would be liable for Re
serve requirements upon comple
tion of their service in the Peace
Corps.
"There are no veterans' bene
fits involved.
"Members might be required to
live in primitive areas.
"If these men were discharged
from the corps they would be im
mediately liable under the pro
visions of the Selective Service
Act.
"Finally, the salaries would be
roughly equivalent to those paid
enlisted men in the armed serv
ices.
"In other words we are pro
posing to take only 1,650 men a
year, which is a very limited num
ber, in Selective Service. If the
need were stepped up And if there
should be a national emergency,
then these men in the Peace
Corps would be immediately lia
ble for any call of their country
for military service, as well as
anvone else."
MR. PROXMIRE: "Would the
Senator please indicate what kind
of specific need there is for the
services these young men would
perform in the underdeveloped
countries such as in Africa and
in Asia?"
MR. HUMPHREY: "Well, one
groat opportunity we have is to
let these young people go partic
ularly into the areas where there
is a great degree of illiteracy, as
teachers and trainers, so to
speak, of the native populations,
at a cost which does not encom
pass figures involved in the pres
ent ICA program.
"As I have indicated, it re
quires approximately $25,000 a

year now to support a person in
the ICA in the technical service
program. The proposed program
is estimated to cost about $6,000
a year per person, which is a
saving of a substantial amount.
"Additionally, the program is
designed as a people-to-people
program, and one that has limited
functions to perform, such as in
public health, education, and in
community development, and not
in the broad economic aspects,
such as the ICA."
MB. PROXMIRE: "The Sen
ator is then saying the proposed
program cannot in any sense re
place or displace what the ICA is
doing; it would supplement that
program; is that correct?"
MR. HUMPHREY: "The pro
posed program does supplement
the ICA program, and it should
not be looked upon as something
to supplant. It is not something
'in place of.' It is something to
add to what we are presently
doing."
MR. PROXMIRE: "Is it not
true that there is a great deal of
enthusiasm for this kind of op
portunity on college campuses
all over the country, and that
there are literally thousands of
young people who are very eager
to have an opportunity to serve
their country in this particular
way? As the Senator from Min
nesota has pointed out, the bill
would not eliminate their obli
gation to serve their country in
the event of war or in the event
of emergency. They would 6till
be liable for that kind of service."
MR. HUMPHREY: "That is
correct."
MR. PROXMIRE: "As I under
stand, tiie proposed legislation
provides that instead of peace
time training in the military
forces, or peacetime service,
young men under the program
would have one year of training,
p a r t i c u I a r 1 y in foreign lan
guages, or a specific language,
which would give them a particu
lar kind of usefulness abroad.
Then for the wage of an Army
private they would serve as
teachers or in other vitally nec
essary jobs in some underdevel
oped country?"
MR. HUMPHREY: "Exactlv."
MR. PROXMIRE: "May I Com
plete the thought which I started
by saying that I have found the
desire on the part of young peo
ple to engage in such a program
as is proposed to be great. Ideal
ism is common to youth. This
kind of idealism and desire to
serve one's country, to do so in
a practical way, to do so in a way
which would permit them to re
turn to America, to marry, to
settle down, and to engage in
the kind of career that most
Americans have, is a great na
tional resource.
"The bill provides an unusual
and wonderful opportunity to tap
and use this resource by permit
ting our young people to serve
their nation and mankind. It
seems to me the Idealism we have
Is not being tapped. It is seeking
an outlet in a constructive, prac
tical, and economical way. It
seems to me that the proposal of
the Senator from Minnesota very
usefully and sensibly takes ad
vantage of this desire for and on
behalf of our country."
