# LETTERS

### 
Letters to the Editor should not j
exceed 250 words. Name, address :
and phone number should be in- j
eluded. Typewritten letters have j
a better chance of appearing. Let-1
ters shall be printed without j
change except in the case of po-1
tentidlly libelous material. The i
fact that any letters hold an op- j
posite viewpoint from the Edi- i
torial Board will not matter.
