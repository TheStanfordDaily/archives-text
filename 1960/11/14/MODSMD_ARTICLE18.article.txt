# Beaver Coach Prothro Defends Clipping Call
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Oregon Stale coach Tommy
Prothro defended the clipping
penalty that nullified Skip Face's
I touchdown run in the closing min
utes of the Beavers' 25-21 victory
over the Tribe.
Prothro claimed that the Indi
ans' Dean Hinshaw clipped Bob
Lazark before Face crossed the
goal line, otherwise, he said, it
would have been a TD.
WHILE ON the subject of the
Cards' called-back score, Prothro
added that he was looking for a
red flag and was mighty happy
when he saw it.
When questioned on the rela
tive merits of California (who
beat the Beavers, 14-6) and Stan
ford. Prothro was reluctant to
say anything stronger .than that
j the Tribe was better offensively,
'and the Bears were stronger de
| fensively.
The Beaver mentor added that
j he knew his squad would be in
for a rough afternoon when Stan
ford coach Jack Curtice had told |
him that the Indians were ready j
and it was too bad it wasn't the
Big Game.
PROTHRO also said, "I have
never seen Norman (the Indians'
quarterback) have anything but
a good day,"and that he was
glad the Card passer was gradu
ating.
Prothro blamed the brief ex
hibition of fisticuffs that flared
up when Card end Steve Pursell
rushed through the Beaver line
as Oregon State fullback John
Kirby downed the ball in an effort
to run out the clock on the Indi
ans' frustration.
The Oregon State coach said
he'd "been that way myself" and
could understand Stanford's dis
appointment after coming so close
to victory.

C OMMENTING on the rain, un
usual for Stanford football
games, Prothro guessed that the
wet field didn't effect the game
greatly but the rain did.
"It seemed to always start to
rain when we had the ball," was
his comment.
Discussing his team's perfor
mance, Prothro stated that he
didn't think the Beavers played
an outstanding game, but that he
was pleased with tailback Don
Kasso's effort.
THE BEAVER coach praised
Kasso while saying that the for
mer Berkeley High flash out
played Terry Bake r, Oregon
State's other tailback.
Prothro asserted that this was
the best game Kasso has played
since he returned from his injury
and that he wished he could find
a way to play Kasso and his rival
for the No. 1 tailback spot, Baker,
in the same backfield.
