# Cactus Jack Disappointed Over Indians' 25-21 Loss
## 
### KEN DERY 
Cactus Jack Curtice was dis-'
appointed obviously but has been
around college football long
enough to know that the game
is full of great peaks and depres
sions. One of these depressions
was Saturday's 25-21 loss to Ore
gon State College.
The coach immediately was
asked if he thought that co-cap
tain tackle Dean Hinshaw had
been guilty of a clipping infrac
tion that cost the winles.s Indians
a victory over the Beavers.
"I'LL KNOW when I see the
pictures," was the only reply.
There is nothing much that can
be done when a referee's decision
! has been made — either for or
J against your team. Cactus Jack
and all the Stanford students
J present at the Big Came two
| years ago remember lhat their
j team was beaten on a referee's
I call of an extra point try (the
movies later showed that the offi
cial had made a mistake).

But being right or wrong
doesn't change the present situ
ation. Stanford is still looking for
that initial victory of the 1960
campaign, and there is but one
chance remaining next week
when California is the opponent
in tiie annual Big Game.
AS DISAPPOINTED as he was,
Coach Curtice was very exuber
ant in praising his team, which
had been a 12-point underdog.
"Did you ever see anything like
our kids. They really put out a
great effort after all they've been
through this year. They really
showed guts and courage."
Coach Jack was asked if he
could single out any particular
outstanding men for Stanford,
and he came up with the name
of 6-1 207-pound sophomore Steve
Pursell the end who did a truly
outstanding job of fighting off
the blockers on numerous end
sweeps to his side. "Steve kept
his feet well and did a heck of a
job out there," replied Curtice.

Quickly the head coach made
the point that he considered the
game a real team effort, and this
statement was certainly true for
all the Cards played well. The
blocking and tackling was the
strongest of any time during the
yea r.
CURTICE looked both hopeful
and a bit worried when queried
about next week's Rig Game. He
was pleased about the fine effort
his team gave but also said "I
hope they didn't take too much
out of our gang for next week.''
There was a brief but energetic
display of fisticuffs as the final
gun blew, but under the circum
stances of the Stanford defeat it
was evident to all that the light
was not malicious but had grown
merely out of a t re m en d o us
amount of frustration. Contrary
to some reports, Coach Curtice
was not knocked down in the
scuffle. Smiled Cactus Jack, "If
I had been, J'<l probably still be
there."

appointed obviously but has been
around college football long
enough to know that the game
is full of great peaks and depres
sions. One of these depressions
was Saturday's 25-21 loss to Ore
gon State College.
The coach immediately was
asked if he thought that co-cap
tain tackle Dean Hinshaw had
been guilty of a clipping infrac
tion that cost the winles.s Indians
a victory over the Beavers.
"I'LL KNOW when I see the
pictures," was the only reply.
There is nothing much that can
be done when a referee's decision
! has been made — either for or
J against your team. Cactus Jack
and all the Stanford students
J present at the Big Came two
| years ago remember lhat their
j team was beaten on a referee's
I call of an extra point try (the
movies later showed that the offi
cial had made a mistake).

But being right or wrong
doesn't change the present situ
ation. Stanford is still looking for
that initial victory of the 1960
campaign, and there is but one
chance remaining next week
when California is the opponent
in tiie annual Big Game.
AS DISAPPOINTED as he was,
Coach Curtice was very exuber
ant in praising his team, which
had been a 12-point underdog.
"Did you ever see anything like
our kids. They really put out a
great effort after all they've been
through this year. They really
showed guts and courage."
Coach Jack was asked if he
could single out any particular
outstanding men for Stanford,
and he came up with the name
of 6-1 207-pound sophomore Steve
Pursell the end who did a truly
outstanding job of fighting off
the blockers on numerous end
sweeps to his side. "Steve kept
his feet well and did a heck of a
job out there," replied Curtice.

Quickly the head coach made
the point that he considered the
game a real team effort, and this
statement was certainly true for
all the Cards played well. The
blocking and tackling was the
strongest of any time during the
yea r.
CURTICE looked both hopeful
and a bit worried when queried
about next week's Rig Game. He
was pleased about the fine effort
his team gave but also said "I
hope they didn't take too much
out of our gang for next week.''
There was a brief but energetic
display of fisticuffs as the final
gun blew, but under the circum
stances of the Stanford defeat it
was evident to all that the light
was not malicious but had grown
merely out of a t re m en d o us
amount of frustration. Contrary
to some reports, Coach Curtice
was not knocked down in the
scuffle. Smiled Cactus Jack, "If
I had been, J'<l probably still be
there."
