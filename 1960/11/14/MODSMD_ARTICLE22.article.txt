# Gallery to Show Nepalese Art
## 
### 
The first collection of Nepalese
art offered for a traveling exhi
bition in the United States will be
shown at the Art Gallery Wednes
day, Nov. 16 through Dec. 4.
The gallery will be closed to
morrow while the 75-piece exhi
bition is set up. Regular hours at
the gallery are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily except Mondays; Sunday
12 to 4 p.m. Admission is free.
Objects in the collection date
from the 9th century and reflects
both the impetus of Indian cul
ture and the individuality of the
isolated mountain culture of
Nepal.
Among the items are a wooden
cabinet with voluptuously pos
turing yakshi figures carved on
the sliding doors, and elaborately
painted mandala describing the
shape of an imagined cosmos,
a model of a Buddhist type pa
goda, and statues and figures in
stone, clay, and metal.
The collection was gathered by
Thomas O. Ballinger, who lived
in Nepal for two years.
