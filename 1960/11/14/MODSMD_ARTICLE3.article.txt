A Marine major doing gradu-
I ate work in education apparently
I committed suicide Thursday
! night, the fourth Stanford stu
j dent to die in the last three weeks.
He was Maj. Crawford B. Ma
lone, 41, who lived at Moffett
Naval Air Station's bachelor offi
cers' quarters.
Navy officials at Moffett re-
I ported tht Malone's body was dis
covered at <S p.m. Thursday in his
car, which was parked with the
motor running in a garage.
A HOSE was found leading
from the auto's exhaust pipe
through a window into the car.
He apparently died of asphyxia
tion.
Reason for the apparent suicide
was unknown, as Navy officials
reported finding no notes, and
friends of the major said they
knew of no reason which would
lead him to take his own life.
An investigation was ordered
by the Navy. Malone's body was
taken to the Oak Knoll Naval
Hospital in Oakland where an
autopsy was scheduled to be per
formed Saturday.
MAEONE was graduated from
Baylor University last year with
a B A. in history and psychology.
He was seeking his master's de
cree in education here.
A University spokesman said
Malone was doing well in his
studies. He was carrying 17 units.
He was a native of Waco, Tex.
Funeral arrangements are pend
ing.
Malone was the second grad
student to die last week. Last
Sunday a woman graduate stu
dent in journalism died of can
cel-. And in late October two
freshmen died, one by suicide and
one in an auto accident.
