San Kranciseo has lagged behind the Kasl in ils accept
ance of contcmporarx art. there can he little douhl
that w itliin the last several xears, modern art has come
to San I' rauciseo.
\hbott I'attison. a (liicago sculptor, Nvas recent In
oii the \\ est (.oast exhibiting some ol his work in the
Keingarteii (Galleries in San Kranciseo and ( jarniel. "I
w as parlieulark curious as to the artistic climate and
aeli\il\ in San Kranciseo. he said. "*l had a Inhrid
concept of n\ hat to expect sonic sort of a combination
of recent artistic accomplishments and perhaps an ex
pected apatliN I on\ a ids cont cm pora in art activits.
"Mnt in San Kranciseo, I'attison continues. '"I
sensed a real similaritN to the artists experiences in
( liicago when- nnc have been part ol and witness to
a rapid and overw helming mushrooming growth of
public interest in the arts in the past Icnn Ncars. I
should fines.-- that artistieallN San Kranciseo is right
now entering into such a glowing period ol artistic
creatiNity. Heallv this should not ha\c surprised me
in >.m Kranciseo a place that is iu itself a magnifi
cciil hleml ol man and nat lire.
el it i- on I x iccciilln that the artistic climate and
actiNilN in the HaN Region luinc begun to develop and
iu .uiN nnan approach thai of the l ast. \ml this is
logical: loi compared n\ iI h points cast. Sail I'lanci-co
ha- had less chance to «ee art. facilities are not a*
adequate here as the) are. for inslau.ec, iu New

which has lour major museums supported I»x the tre
mendous interest in art.
I here is an entrenched historv of modern art in
the Kast that has been digested lin the conscious pub
lic. (.liicago, for example, being 20(10 miles closer to
New ork, has had that much more chance to be in
contact w i 111 eonleniporar\ happenings and thought.
Arthur Okainura. a proinincut HaN Area artist,
cites an instance of the influence that this geographical
situation has had on art iu the San Kranciseo area:
"\an (»ogh became a "recent discover\ here because
of the 111 on ie and. in 10," W. a fairK large, comprehen
sive exhibit of hi- Nvork. I was introduced to him I
n ears ago in < Ihicago because ol an exhibit at that lime.
Sail Kranciseo is late in aspects like this because of
location and its factors.
Hut in the last five Ncars communications have in
creased to such a decree that San Kranciseo and cer
tain areas in the countrN are able to develop their own
artists and are becoming artistic centers in their own
right. \s a result the public iu parts of the countrN
outside of the Kastern art centers is able to lake a
more direct interest iu art.
I here have never been so iii.iiin art magazines and
"artN magazines. Modern art. poetrN. music, dance,
the Mcalniks more ami more news space is being
given to llietu I lie public i- learning more ami more
about llicm and throughout the coiiiilin interest iu
art i- mushrooming.

paintings from the Fast are imported here and vice
\crsa.
I)iseussinjj the liav Area art scene a*> it is today,
Okamura di\ides the San Francisco area artists into
several different groups although he cautions that
'"one would have to explore endless extensions <>112
sources to lit definitions on am of the groups and
painters.
There is a "fi«iurative painting firoup which at
lirsi had more abstract involvement and later turned
to painting in which the plastic consideration of paint
is an important measure. I here is a definite indige
nous '"look to this.
Then there are those involved in "action painting
possihk inspired hv schools centering in New ork.
This has a "traveled* look and is. vou »av. in

Vtul there is a third smaller ;:roup one so diverse

there i* nco-dadaism, neo-surrealisiu and ueo-roinauti
