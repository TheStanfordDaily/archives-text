### 
There are four principal resi
dent theater companies in San
Francisco: the Actor\s Workshop,
the Company of the Golden Hind,
the Interplayers and the Play
house. In addition, Gilbert and
Sullivan shows are produced by
the Lamplighters, contemporary
musicals, by the Opera Ring, and
dance-dramas, by the Contempo
rary Dancers.
All feature reasonable ticket
prices.
The most prominent and profes
sional of these is the Actor's
Workshop which was founded in
1952 by two San Francisco State
College professors, Jules Irving
and Herbert Blau.
FROM A LOFT above a judo
academy, the company moved, in
1953, to a former Ford storage
plant which had been converted
into a church and then to an arena
theater. This was their home un
til 1955 when freeway construc
tion went through the storehou.se
church-1 heater, forcing them to
transfer to the Marine's Memorial
Theater on Sutter and Mason
streets. A second theater, the En
core, located just off Geary on
Mason, was added last year.
The Workshop first achieved
city-wide recognition through
critical acclaim for its production i
of "Death of a Salesman" in 1954.1
Along with moving to the Ma
rine's Memorial during the run |
of "The Crucible," the company;
gained professional status with
signing of the first off-Broadway
Equitity contract in the Bay Area.
THE 1956 SEASON saw the
American premiere of Bertolt
Brecht's "Mother Courage," the
first appearance of Viveca Lind- j
fors in "Miss Julie" and one of j
the group's longest-running
shows, "The Flowering Peach."
The Workshop presented the West |
Coast premiere of "Waiting fori
Godot" in 1957, the production!
which was chosen to represent j
the United States at the Brussels '
World's Fair.
The company now numbers 105 J
actors and technicians, some of I
whom are employed on a full-time j
basis thanks to the Ford Founda-1
tion's grant of $156,000 made this |
year. The rest of the company;
work on a part-time basis depend
ing upon the current productions.!
Between six and 10 shows are
presented each year in the two j
theaters. Seating capacities are |
small, with the Encore holding!
139 persons and the Marine's Me-;
morial, 640.
CURRENTLY playing at the;
Marine's is another Ford Founda-!
tion winner, an original play by j
Miriam Stovall, "The Rocks Cried ]
Out," which deals with segrega
tion. It is scheduled to play Fri
day and Saturday nights through
Dec. 3 and on Dec. 10. Two per

ed; "A Touch of the Poet" will be;

as the foremost theater company,
not only on the West Coast, but
in the country."
Growing up Alongside the
Workshop has been the Company
