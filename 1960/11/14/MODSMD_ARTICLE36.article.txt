# Bay Area Theater Achievements Win National Acclaim
## 
### MARY LOU MckINLEY 
The March 1960 issue of Theater Arts said that San Francis
cans are ''unquestionably furnished with more local theater than
am other comparative metropolitan area."
The post-war years saw a spurt of liltl<> theater activity in the
Hay Area which i> still going strong. \losi of the groups are still
in their first decade ol existence, the oldest having been organ
ized in J946.
Paralleling the growth ol ofl-Broadwav productions in New
\ ork in the 1920's and .iO s, the theater groups sprang from a
desire to produce good drama on a local level apart from the
highly competitive, comniercial legitimate theater.
Already the Actors Workshop has become a permanent, pro
fessional repertory theater with the help of the Ford Foundation
which awarded $156,000 to the group this year.
Another tribute to San Francisco theater came last year when
the Ford Foundation singled out the Actor's Workshop and the
Stanford I'layers for assistance in producing two original plavs
selected through the Foundation's program to encourage new
playwrights. Only eight theater groups throughout the nation
were chosen for lliis honor.
I lie Actor's Workshop was again directly involved in the pres
tige of San Francisco land American) theater when il was selected
by the Stale Department to represent American Kegional Theater
at the Brussels World Fair in I ( >.">7. The play presented was "W ail
ing for (Jodot."
WHILE UNQUESTIONABLY led by the Actor's Workshop,
the other Bay Area little theaters are also notable for the over-all
qualitv of their productions. Fighting inadequate stage facilities
and operating on minimal budgets for the most part, the groups
nonetheless manage to draw critical acclaim for most of their shows
—and critical notice for all.
With the increased coverage by the press and more paid ad
vertising in the newspapers, these resident theater groups are
naturally drawing larger audiences all the lime. However, sup
port is erratic, particularly for the smaller groups, and perform
ances must be limited to weekends onlv, with occasional exceptions
Be cause of lliis transient audience, the theaters which origin
ally began with purely experimental or classical plays have had
to alter policies somewhat. Competition for paving customers is
keen and bas resulted in an abundance of musicals and li"ht come
dies.
AS OFF-BROADW was once and still is—considered the
proving ground for new authors, new ideas and new theater in
general, San Francisco may well become the new frontier for thea
ter in the coming years. It certainly will if the next ten years bring
as much growth, activity and imagination as the last ten.
I hen, as San Francisco becomes more and more a svnonvm for
theatrical activity, she will attract and bold belter and more local
and non-local talent. I his, along with the need for better stage
facilities, will require the attention of far-sighted producers and
directors in the next several years.
Of course, this requires substantial sums of money which onl\
pay ing audiences can provide. And paying audiences support
first, light, frothy theater, and only second, the new and experi
mental.
W bile the quantity of so-called intellectual (progressive might
be a better word I theater may be limited for llie lime being, once
these little theaters achieve permanent, professional status, with
a reputation and sufficient funds behind them, there will be no
limits to the influence San I'ranciseo could have on American
theater.
