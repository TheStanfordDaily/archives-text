# New Galleries Appear as Interest in Art Increases
## 
### 
An amazing number of now >
art galleries have appeared in j
San Francisco in the past several
years the result of the recent
arrival of an awareness of art in
general and modern art in partic
ular to the Bay Area.
And by the same token, the al- ■
ready existant galleries have I
gained in clientele and prospered, i
CHARLES FEINGARTEN left
his Chicago gallery long enough
in 1957 to come to San Francisco
and start a branch of Feingarten
Galleries at 535 Sutter St. Since
then he has opened additional
branches in Carmel and New J

York City in response to the in
creasing interest in art which
seems to be appearing the coun
try over.
This month Feingarten will be
displaying the work of Bay Area
artist Arthur Okamura. Okamura
studied at I lie School of the Ait
Institute of Chicago where he
won the Edward L. Ryerson
Travel Fellowship. He has also
won a fellowship to Vale Univer
sity and has been an instructor
at several art schools, among
others the Art Institute of Chi
cago, the California School of
Fine Arts, and the California

College of Arts and Crafts in
Oakland. Recently selected one
of the top ten young contem
porary painters in America by
the magazine, "Art in America,"
he was featured in their spring
l!),")!) Issue devoted i" NEW TAL
ENT IN THE U.S.A.
Then in 1958 an internationally
noted architect, John S. Bolles in
corporated the Boll<>s Gallery at
729 Sansome St. Through his gal
lery centered in the City's busi
ness and design section, Bolles
hopes to spur the development of
contemporary art with relation to
today's architecture.
BOLLES SAID, "Art must be
conceived as an integral part of
the architecture, and must not be
an afterthought or planned on a
percentage basis."
The Bolles Gallery is extremely
spacious with a "big city" atmos
phere. And from now through
Dec. 2. paintings from Italy
"The Young Italians" will be on
display.
The Art Gallery at Gump's, 250
Post St., which will celebrate its
100 th anniversary in 19(51, is one
of the oldest departments of the
store and one of its outstanding
highlights. There is a main gal
lery . . . plus a smaller room
which they call the inner gallery,
both featuring fine contemporary
painting and sculpture and Amer
ican and European graphics.
TIIE GALLERY'S November
exhibition is of paintings by
Conger Metcalf from Boston. He
has had several New York shows
and has exhibited at the Institute
of Contemporary Arts in Boston
and the Dallas Museum of Fine
Arts.
Metcalf is Professor of Paint
ing at Boston University where
he spends the academic year with
his summers devoted to travel
and painting in Italy. The current
exhibition at Gump's is the work
of this past summer.
Another gallery of interest is
Fredric Hobbs —Fine Arts, situ
ated at 2264 Union St. in a con
verted Victorian home. Normally

showing approximately forty
works with additional exhibition
space provided in the sculpture
court in front of the building, the
gallery emphasizes the work of
Pacific Coast artists whose work
is exhibited regularly in Ameri
can museums.
During November, the Hobbs
gallery is exhibiting the work of
Ellwood Graham. An important
figure in American painting, Gra
ham has exhibited widely in the
United States and Mexico, where
his work has received top awards
in competitive exhibitions.
AND THERE is the Kullier
more Galleries at 3024 Fillmore
St., a large gallery which was
established twelve years ago.
Dealing also in contemporary
paintings and sculpture, they are
currently showing the paintings
of Mr. Hector Eseobosa, the pres
ident of I. Magnin and Company.
A year ago Margaret Brunn, in
self defense, opened the Briinn
Gallery at 17 Adler St. Herself an
artist, she felt that none of the
existing San Francisco galleries
satisfied the need for an intimate
gallery showing only the best
works of the City's local artists.
"So," said Miss Brunn, a tall
blonde in her thirties, "some
friends and I did over an old
building in North Beach that had
housed a Chinese laundry for
some twenty years. I still have
people come in with a bundle of
laundry in their arms looking
confused."
THE MAIN gallery is a long
narrow high-ceilinged room with
white walls. Miss Brunn tries to
have two one-man shows and
then a group show to give all her
artists a chance to have their
work shown. The Brunn Gallery
which prides itself on offering
carefully selected work from the
best of San Francisco's finest
artists, is this month showing the
works of Charles Matt ox.
Then last Feb. 8, the small airy,
sunny-faced Galerie Gihlea, with
its white walls and gold wall-to
wall carpet, opened at 811 Bush
St.
This'gallery shows all types of
paintings abstract, realist, im
pressionist, American - western;
sculpture also, with semi-abstract
forms and animals.
This month drawings and the
Impressionist paintings of Mr.
Gavriel Spat are being exhibited.
AND FINALLY one of the
most unusual galleries in San
Francisco The Artists' Coopera
tive, Inc. The gallery, at 2224
Union Street, has no owner who
acts as an intermediary between
artist and buyer, but this is a
nonprofit organization, operated
by the artist members the art
ists' own gallery where paintings
can be bought at the artists' own
prices.
The gallery is the largest in
California excepting the muse
ums. but a high artistic standard
is maintained by the jury, com
posed of five competent mem
bers, which selects all the art to
be exhibited.
Started five and a half years
ago by Thadee Skar and a nu
cleus of local artists, the exhibit
ing artist still run Ihe gallery,
donating their time and effort (6
hours in the gallery monthly)
plus administrative or committee
work to make it a success.


ABBOTT PATTISON'S EXODUS AS IT HANGS AT THE
STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER — Not the Biblical Ex
odus, explains Pattison, but rather a more contemporary
Exodus which is constantly plaguing mankind. These en
forced departures have often had beneficial results whether
they were caused by war, famine or other reasons. These
periods of Exodus in our own country's history would in
clude the settling of the colonial days and the later flow of
our people into the western states. Donated to the Center
last year, the sculpture is of three figures in movement and
is made of sheet steel cut and hammered, overlaid with a
coating of nickel-silver, brazed over the surface, bit by bit,
to add texture, lustre and contrast to the steel surface.

people come in with a bundle of

confused."
THE MAIN gallery is a long
narrow high-ceilinged room with
white walls. Miss Brunn tries to
have two one-man shows and

ABBOTT PATTISON'S EXODUS AS IT HANGS AT THE
STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER — Not the Biblical Ex

Exodus which is constantly plaguing mankind. These en
forced departures have often had beneficial results whether
they were caused by war, famine or other reasons. These
periods of Exodus in our own country's history would in
clude the settling of the colonial days and the later flow of
our people into the western states. Donated to the Center
last year, the sculpture is of three figures in movement and
is made of sheet steel cut and hammered, overlaid with a
coating of nickel-silver, brazed over the surface, bit by bit,
to add texture, lustre and contrast to the steel surface.

BOLLES SAID, "Art must be

729 Sansome St. Through his gal
lery centered in the City's busi
ness and design section, Bolles
hopes to spur the development of
contemporary art with relation to
today's architecture.
BOLLES SAID, "Art must be
conceived as an integral part of
the architecture, and must not be
an afterthought or planned on a
percentage basis."
The Bolles Gallery is extremely
spacious with a "big city" atmos
phere. And from now through
Dec. 2. paintings from Italy
"The Young Italians" will be on
display.
The Art Gallery at Gump's, 250
Post St., which will celebrate its
100 th anniversary in 19(51, is one
of the oldest departments of the
store and one of its outstanding
highlights. There is a main gal
lery . . . plus a smaller room
which they call the inner gallery,
both featuring fine contemporary
painting and sculpture and Amer
ican and European graphics.
TIIE GALLERY'S November
exhibition is of paintings by
Conger Metcalf from Boston. He
has had several New York shows
and has exhibited at the Institute
of Contemporary Arts in Boston
and the Dallas Museum of Fine
Arts.
Metcalf is Professor of Paint
ing at Boston University where
he spends the academic year with
his summers devoted to travel
and painting in Italy. The current
exhibition at Gump's is the work
of this past summer.
Another gallery of interest is
Fredric Hobbs —Fine Arts, situ
ated at 2264 Union St. in a con
verted Victorian home. Normally

showing approximately forty
works with additional exhibition
space provided in the sculpture
court in front of the building, the
gallery emphasizes the work of
Pacific Coast artists whose work
is exhibited regularly in Ameri
can museums.
During November, the Hobbs
gallery is exhibiting the work of
Ellwood Graham. An important
figure in American painting, Gra
ham has exhibited widely in the
United States and Mexico, where
his work has received top awards
in competitive exhibitions.
AND THERE is the Kullier
more Galleries at 3024 Fillmore
St., a large gallery which was
established twelve years ago.
Dealing also in contemporary
paintings and sculpture, they are
currently showing the paintings
of Mr. Hector Eseobosa, the pres
ident of I. Magnin and Company.
A year ago Margaret Brunn, in
self defense, opened the Briinn
Gallery at 17 Adler St. Herself an
artist, she felt that none of the
existing San Francisco galleries
satisfied the need for an intimate
gallery showing only the best
works of the City's local artists.
"So," said Miss Brunn, a tall
blonde in her thirties, "some
friends and I did over an old
building in North Beach that had
housed a Chinese laundry for
some twenty years. I still have
people come in with a bundle of
laundry in their arms looking
confused."
THE MAIN gallery is a long
narrow high-ceilinged room with
white walls. Miss Brunn tries to
have two one-man shows and
then a group show to give all her
artists a chance to have their
work shown. The Brunn Gallery
which prides itself on offering
carefully selected work from the
best of San Francisco's finest
artists, is this month showing the
works of Charles Matt ox.
Then last Feb. 8, the small airy,
sunny-faced Galerie Gihlea, with
its white walls and gold wall-to
wall carpet, opened at 811 Bush
St.
This'gallery shows all types of
paintings abstract, realist, im
pressionist, American - western;
sculpture also, with semi-abstract
forms and animals.
This month drawings and the
Impressionist paintings of Mr.
Gavriel Spat are being exhibited.
AND FINALLY one of the
most unusual galleries in San
Francisco The Artists' Coopera
tive, Inc. The gallery, at 2224
Union Street, has no owner who
acts as an intermediary between
artist and buyer, but this is a
nonprofit organization, operated
by the artist members the art
ists' own gallery where paintings
can be bought at the artists' own
prices.
The gallery is the largest in
California excepting the muse
ums. but a high artistic standard
is maintained by the jury, com
posed of five competent mem
bers, which selects all the art to
be exhibited.
Started five and a half years
ago by Thadee Skar and a nu
cleus of local artists, the exhibit

donating their time and effort (6
hours in the gallery monthly)
plus administrative or committee
work to make it a success.


ABBOTT PATTISON'S EXODUS AS IT HANGS AT THE
STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER — Not the Biblical Ex

Exodus which is constantly plaguing mankind. These en
forced departures have often had beneficial results whether
they were caused by war, famine or other reasons. These
periods of Exodus in our own country's history would in
clude the settling of the colonial days and the later flow of
our people into the western states. Donated to the Center
last year, the sculpture is of three figures in movement and
is made of sheet steel cut and hammered, overlaid with a
coating of nickel-silver, brazed over the surface, bit by bit,
to add texture, lustre and contrast to the steel surface.

ABBOTT PATTISON'S EXODUS AS IT HANGS AT THE
STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER — Not the Biblical Ex
odus, explains Pattison, but rather a more contemporary
Exodus which is constantly plaguing mankind. These en
forced departures have often had beneficial results whether
they were caused by war, famine or other reasons. These
periods of Exodus in our own country's history would in
clude the settling of the colonial days and the later flow of
our people into the western states. Donated to the Center
last year, the sculpture is of three figures in movement and
is made of sheet steel cut and hammered, overlaid with a
coating of nickel-silver, brazed over the surface, bit by bit,
to add texture, lustre and contrast to the steel surface.

CHARLES FEINGARTEN left
his Chicago gallery long enough
in 1957 to come to San Francisco
and start a branch of Feingarten
Galleries at 535 Sutter St. Since
then he has opened additional
branches in Carmel and New J

York City in response to the in
creasing interest in art which
seems to be appearing the coun
try over.
This month Feingarten will be
displaying the work of Bay Area
artist Arthur Okamura. Okamura
studied at I lie School of the Ait
Institute of Chicago where he
won the Edward L. Ryerson
Travel Fellowship. He has also
won a fellowship to Vale Univer
sity and has been an instructor
at several art schools, among
others the Art Institute of Chi
cago, the California School of
Fine Arts, and the California

College of Arts and Crafts in
Oakland. Recently selected one
of the top ten young contem
porary painters in America by
the magazine, "Art in America,"
he was featured in their spring
l!),")!) Issue devoted i" NEW TAL
ENT IN THE U.S.A.
Then in 1958 an internationally
noted architect, John S. Bolles in
corporated the Boll<>s Gallery at
729 Sansome St. Through his gal
lery centered in the City's busi
ness and design section, Bolles
hopes to spur the development of
contemporary art with relation to
today's architecture.
BOLLES SAID, "Art must be
conceived as an integral part of
the architecture, and must not be
an afterthought or planned on a
percentage basis."
The Bolles Gallery is extremely
spacious with a "big city" atmos
phere. And from now through
Dec. 2. paintings from Italy
"The Young Italians" will be on
display.
The Art Gallery at Gump's, 250
Post St., which will celebrate its
100 th anniversary in 19(51, is one
of the oldest departments of the
store and one of its outstanding
highlights. There is a main gal
lery . . . plus a smaller room
which they call the inner gallery,
both featuring fine contemporary
painting and sculpture and Amer
ican and European graphics.
TIIE GALLERY'S November
exhibition is of paintings by
Conger Metcalf from Boston. He
has had several New York shows
and has exhibited at the Institute
of Contemporary Arts in Boston
and the Dallas Museum of Fine
Arts.
Metcalf is Professor of Paint
ing at Boston University where
he spends the academic year with
his summers devoted to travel
and painting in Italy. The current
exhibition at Gump's is the work
of this past summer.
Another gallery of interest is
Fredric Hobbs —Fine Arts, situ
ated at 2264 Union St. in a con
verted Victorian home. Normally

showing approximately forty
works with additional exhibition
space provided in the sculpture
court in front of the building, the
gallery emphasizes the work of
Pacific Coast artists whose work
is exhibited regularly in Ameri
can museums.
During November, the Hobbs
gallery is exhibiting the work of
Ellwood Graham. An important
figure in American painting, Gra
ham has exhibited widely in the
United States and Mexico, where
his work has received top awards
in competitive exhibitions.
AND THERE is the Kullier
more Galleries at 3024 Fillmore
St., a large gallery which was
established twelve years ago.
Dealing also in contemporary
paintings and sculpture, they are
currently showing the paintings
of Mr. Hector Eseobosa, the pres
ident of I. Magnin and Company.
A year ago Margaret Brunn, in
self defense, opened the Briinn
Gallery at 17 Adler St. Herself an
artist, she felt that none of the
existing San Francisco galleries
satisfied the need for an intimate
gallery showing only the best
works of the City's local artists.
"So," said Miss Brunn, a tall
blonde in her thirties, "some
friends and I did over an old
building in North Beach that had
housed a Chinese laundry for
some twenty years. I still have
people come in with a bundle of
laundry in their arms looking
confused."
THE MAIN gallery is a long
narrow high-ceilinged room with
white walls. Miss Brunn tries to
have two one-man shows and
then a group show to give all her
artists a chance to have their
work shown. The Brunn Gallery
which prides itself on offering
carefully selected work from the
best of San Francisco's finest
artists, is this month showing the
works of Charles Matt ox.
Then last Feb. 8, the small airy,
sunny-faced Galerie Gihlea, with
its white walls and gold wall-to
wall carpet, opened at 811 Bush
St.
This'gallery shows all types of
paintings abstract, realist, im
pressionist, American - western;
sculpture also, with semi-abstract
forms and animals.
This month drawings and the
Impressionist paintings of Mr.
Gavriel Spat are being exhibited.
AND FINALLY one of the
most unusual galleries in San
Francisco The Artists' Coopera
tive, Inc. The gallery, at 2224
Union Street, has no owner who
acts as an intermediary between
artist and buyer, but this is a
nonprofit organization, operated
by the artist members the art

can be bought at the artists' own
