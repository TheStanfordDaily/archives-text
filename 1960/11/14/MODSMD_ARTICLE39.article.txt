# Son Francisco Ballet Co. Captures American Spirit
## 
### SHERRY WELCH 
A vigorous ballet company . . .
a company recognized the world
over for its effective expression
of American beauty, vitality and
spirit . . . the oldest ballet com
pany in the United Stales, the
most-travelled classical ballet
company in the world the San
Francisco Ballet.
They have danced before the
King of Thailand, before Madame
Chiang Kai-Shek in Formosa, and
before the Governor General of
Hong Kong and the Prime Min
ister of Burma. Lew Christensen,
the director of the company, was
decorated by the King of Cam
bodia. The King and Queen of
Greece witnessed a command per
formance. And Emperor Haile So
lasie awarded each dancer with
a gold medal.
FOUNDED in 1933 as the San
Francisco Opera Ballet, the com
pany's main purpose was to keep
the famed San Francisco Opera
supplied with dancers.
In 1937, Serge Oukrainsky suc
ceeded Bolm as choroographorand
continued to enlarge the com
pany's scope. The future develop
ment of the company was pres
aged when Oukrainsky appointed
Willam Christensen as premier
danseur. Christensen succeeded
Oukrainsky a year later, and a
new era for the company began.
Christensen made the company
a full-scale organization. To its
repertoire he added the evening
lons ballet, presenting such works
as Coppelia, Swan Lake and The
Nutcracker in their entirety. The
Nutcracker was so successful that
its presentation at Christmas each
year has become a tradition in
the major cities of the West
Coast.
In 19.11, Lew Christensen took
Willam's place as head of the
company.
AND as a result of his leader
ship. an exchange agreement was
made in 1952 between the San
Francisco Ballet and the New
York City Ballet, for which Chris
tensen, at the time, also served
as a director. The exchange agree
ment enabled each company to
perform works from the reper
toire of the other as well as to
exchange solo dancers.
Audiences were enthusiastic
about what they saw. and the re
sultant critical acclaim presaged
the first tour of the San Fran
cisco Ballot across the United
States.
At this time one of the critics
wrote of the company that "the
company which had been a source
of regional pride had now ma
tured into a national asset."
Thus the next step for the Bal
lot was international travel and
the troupe has just recently com
pleted its third international tour
under the sponsorship of the
American National TheaUe and

Academy in conjunction with the
State Department.
In January 1957 the San Fran
cisco Ballet left o.n a tour of Ihe
Far East, be coming the first
American company to perform
anywhere in* the Far East and
the first company from any West
ern nation to perform in this part
of the world since the 1920's when
Pavlova toured the Far East. The
tour took the c o m p a ny some
35,000 miles across Asia.
IN JANUARY of 1958 the
troupers danced off on a three
and one-half month tour of Latin
America and from January until
May of 1959. the San Francisco
Ballet performed in the Mid-East
and Central and North Africa.
Two of the most remarkable
characteristics of the San Fran
cisco Ballet are its perfect hom
ogeneity and unity of style. Their
effortless technical mastery is ex

plained by the fact that every
member of the company has had
a minimum of ten years' rigorous
training.
AND in the gradation of classi
cal ballet, the company does not
operate on the "star" system. The
harmony of teamwork is espe
cially developed in the company,
for almost every member per
forms as soloist on occasion, and
dancers frequently alternate in
solo roles.
During the Christmas season,
the Company will present "Beauty
and the Beast" on December IS
and 19 in San Francisco, "The
Nutcracker" in Palo Alto on De
cember 20. and"The Nutcracker"
at the San Francisco Opera House
on December 22, 23, 24, 20 and 27.
The Spring season at the Alcazar
Theatre will be from March 10
to April 22 every Friday and Sat
urday-.

pany's scope. The future develop
ment of the company was pres
aged when Oukrainsky appointed
Willam Christensen as premier
danseur. Christensen succeeded
Oukrainsky a year later, and a
new era for the company began.
Christensen made the company
a full-scale organization. To its
repertoire he added the evening
lons ballet, presenting such works
as Coppelia, Swan Lake and The
Nutcracker in their entirety. The
Nutcracker was so successful that
its presentation at Christmas each
year has become a tradition in
the major cities of the West
Coast.
In 19.11, Lew Christensen took
Willam's place as head of the
company.
AND as a result of his leader
ship. an exchange agreement was
made in 1952 between the San
Francisco Ballet and the New
York City Ballet, for which Chris
tensen, at the time, also served
as a director. The exchange agree
ment enabled each company to
perform works from the reper
toire of the other as well as to
exchange solo dancers.
Audiences were enthusiastic
about what they saw. and the re
sultant critical acclaim presaged
the first tour of the San Fran
cisco Ballot across the United
States.
At this time one of the critics
wrote of the company that "the
company which had been a source
of regional pride had now ma
tured into a national asset."
Thus the next step for the Bal
lot was international travel and
the troupe has just recently com
pleted its third international tour
under the sponsorship of the
American National TheaUe and

Academy in conjunction with the
State Department.
In January 1957 the San Fran
cisco Ballet left o.n a tour of Ihe
Far East, be coming the first
American company to perform
anywhere in* the Far East and
the first company from any West
ern nation to perform in this part
of the world since the 1920's when
Pavlova toured the Far East. The
tour took the c o m p a ny some
35,000 miles across Asia.
IN JANUARY of 1958 the
troupers danced off on a three
and one-half month tour of Latin
America and from January until
May of 1959. the San Francisco
Ballet performed in the Mid-East
and Central and North Africa.
Two of the most remarkable
characteristics of the San Fran
cisco Ballet are its perfect hom
ogeneity and unity of style. Their
effortless technical mastery is ex

plained by the fact that every
member of the company has had
a minimum of ten years' rigorous
training.
AND in the gradation of classi
cal ballet, the company does not
operate on the "star" system. The
harmony of teamwork is espe
cially developed in the company,
for almost every member per
forms as soloist on occasion, and
dancers frequently alternate in
solo roles.
During the Christmas season,
the Company will present "Beauty
and the Beast" on December IS
and 19 in San Francisco, "The
Nutcracker" in Palo Alto on De
cember 20. and"The Nutcracker"
at the San Francisco Opera House

exchange solo dancers.
Audiences were enthusiastic
about what they saw. and the re
sultant critical acclaim presaged
the first tour of the San Fran
cisco Ballot across the United
States.
At this time one of the critics
wrote of the company that "the
company which had been a source
of regional pride had now ma
tured into a national asset."
Thus the next step for the Bal
lot was international travel and
the troupe has just recently com
pleted its third international tour
under the sponsorship of the
American National TheaUe and

Academy in conjunction with the
State Department.
In January 1957 the San Fran
cisco Ballet left o.n a tour of Ihe
Far East, be coming the first
American company to perform
anywhere in* the Far East and
the first company from any West
ern nation to perform in this part
of the world since the 1920's when
Pavlova toured the Far East. The
tour took the c o m p a ny some
35,000 miles across Asia.
IN JANUARY of 1958 the
troupers danced off on a three
and one-half month tour of Latin
America and from January until
May of 1959. the San Francisco
Ballet performed in the Mid-East
and Central and North Africa.
Two of the most remarkable
characteristics of the San Fran
cisco Ballet are its perfect hom
ogeneity and unity of style. Their
effortless technical mastery is ex

plained by the fact that every
member of the company has had
a minimum of ten years' rigorous
training.
AND in the gradation of classi
cal ballet, the company does not
operate on the "star" system. The
harmony of teamwork is espe
cially developed in the company,
for almost every member per
forms as soloist on occasion, and
dancers frequently alternate in
solo roles.
During the Christmas season,
the Company will present "Beauty
and the Beast" on December IS
and 19 in San Francisco, "The
Nutcracker" in Palo Alto on De
cember 20. and"The Nutcracker"
at the San Francisco Opera House
on December 22, 23, 24, 20 and 27.
The Spring season at the Alcazar
Theatre will be from March 10
to April 22 every Friday and Sat
urday-.
A vigorous ballet company . . .
a company recognized the world
over for its effective expression
of American beauty, vitality and
spirit . . . the oldest ballet com
pany in the United Stales, the
most-travelled classical ballet
company in the world the San
Francisco Ballet.
They have danced before the
King of Thailand, before Madame
Chiang Kai-Shek in Formosa, and
before the Governor General of
Hong Kong and the Prime Min
ister of Burma. Lew Christensen,
the director of the company, was
decorated by the King of Cam
bodia. The King and Queen of
Greece witnessed a command per
formance. And Emperor Haile So
lasie awarded each dancer with
a gold medal.
FOUNDED in 1933 as the San
Francisco Opera Ballet, the com
pany's main purpose was to keep
the famed San Francisco Opera
supplied with dancers.
In 1937, Serge Oukrainsky suc
ceeded Bolm as choroographorand
continued to enlarge the com
pany's scope. The future develop
ment of the company was pres
aged when Oukrainsky appointed
Willam Christensen as premier
danseur. Christensen succeeded
Oukrainsky a year later, and a
new era for the company began.
Christensen made the company
a full-scale organization. To its
repertoire he added the evening
lons ballet, presenting such works
as Coppelia, Swan Lake and The
Nutcracker in their entirety. The
Nutcracker was so successful that
its presentation at Christmas each
year has become a tradition in
the major cities of the West
Coast.
In 19.11, Lew Christensen took
Willam's place as head of the
company.
AND as a result of his leader
ship. an exchange agreement was
made in 1952 between the San
Francisco Ballet and the New
York City Ballet, for which Chris
tensen, at the time, also served
as a director. The exchange agree
ment enabled each company to
perform works from the reper
toire of the other as well as to
exchange solo dancers.
