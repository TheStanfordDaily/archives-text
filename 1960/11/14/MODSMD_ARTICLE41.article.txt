# Peninsula Little Theaters Keep Up With City Groups
## 
### 
Little theaters on the Peninsula,
as well as those in San Francisco,
have experienced a surge of
activity within the last several
years. The four principal ones,
Comedia, Palo Alto Community
Theater, Peninsula Little Thea
ter and Menlo Players Guild, op
erate on a yearly basis and re
ceive good audience support.
In August of 1957 Comedia Rep
ertory Company was started by a
group of six actors and two pro
ducer's who wanted to produce
professional t heater at home,
away from the c o m p e t i ti v e
struggle of New York. After the
second show, one of the produc
ers, Peter Kump, bodght out the
other and is the present execu
tive producer.
THE FIRST THREE produc
tions, "The Mousetrap," "The
Chalk Garden" and "No Exit,"
were given in a conference room
at Rickey's Studio Inn; the next
play, "An Italian Straw Hat," was
produced in an unfinished build
ing. With "Separate Tables," the
fifth play and opening of the sec
ond season, the company moved
into the Loft Theater which has
been the group's headquarters
ever since.
Comedia is composed of 37 ac
tors who are paid "token wages,"
10 apprentices and 12 paid staff
members including three direc
tors. The 25-member Women's
Auxiliary runs the box office,
helps with costume construction
and does the general "busy
work."

Every type of play, from Greek
I tragedies to contemporary experi-
I mental shows and musicals, is
j produced in the 150-seat theater.
"DAMN YANKEES" is cur
rently playing on Saturday nights,
with Arthur Miller's "A View
from the Bridge" playing Fridays
at 8:30 p.m. and Sunday nights
at 7:30.
"The Thirteen Clocks" will be
' revived in December, "Kiss Me
Kate" will play during January,
! and "Arms and the Man" is sched
uled for February. "Look Home
ward, Angel" is set for a March
opening, and Leonard Bernstein's
hit musical "West Side Story"
will be presented in May.

The group was begun in 1931
by a group of theater enthusiasts
who put on shows in the old frame
j building next to the Southern Pa-
I cific station. In 1933 the present
Palo Alto Community Theater

was built—thanks to Mrs. Lucie
Stern and given to the city as
the first unit of the Community
Center.
