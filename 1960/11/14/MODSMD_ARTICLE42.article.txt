HOW TO BEAT THE BEAT GENERATION
My cousin Hcrkie Nylet is a sturdy lad of nineteen summers
who lias, we all believed until recently, a lively intelligence and
an assured future. 1 lerkie's father, Walter (). Nylet, is as every
one knows, president of the First National Artificial Cherry
Company, world's largest maker of artificial cherries for ladies'
hats. 1 ticle Walter had great plans for Hcrkie. Last year he
sent Hcrkie to the Maryland College of Humanities, Sciences,
and Artificial Cherries, and lie intended, upon I lerkie's gradu
ation, to find him a nice fat wife and take him into the firm as
a full partner.
('oukl a young man have more pleasing prospects? ()| course
not. Hut a couple of months ago, to everyone's consternation,
I Icrkie announced that he was not going into the artificial cherry
business. Nor was he going to stay in college. "I am," said
Herkie, ''a member of the Beat Generation. 1 am going to San
Francisco and grow a beard."
Well sir, you can imagine the commotion in the family when
Herkie went traipsing off to San Francisco! Uncle Walter would
have gone after him and dragged him home, but unfortunately
he w«s right in the middle of the artificial cherry season. Aunt
Thclina couldn't go either because of her old leg trouble. (One
of her legs is older than the other.)

So I went. 1 searched Snn Francisco for weeks before I found
I lerkie living under the counter of a Pronto Pup stand. "Herkie,
how j)re you?" 1 cried, looking distraughtly upon his tangled
beard, his corduroy jacket, his stricken eyes.
"Beat," s;iid Herkie.
1 offered him a Marlboro and folt instantly better when he
took it because when one smokes Marlboros, one cannot be too
far removed from the world. One still has, so to speak, a hold
on the finer things of life—like good tobacco, like easy-drawing
filtration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoy
ing a full-flavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basi
cally happiness-oriented, fulfillment-directed, pleasure-prone.
"Herkie, what are you doing with yourself?" 1 asked.
"I am finding myself," lie replied. "I am writing a novel in
the sand with a pointed stick. I am composing a fugue for
clavier and police whistle. 1 am sculpting in experimental ma
terials- like English muffins."
"And what do you do for fun?" I asked.
"Come," he said and took me to a dank little night club
where men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange
crates and drank espresso. ()n a tiny stage stood a poet reciting
a free-form work of his own composition entitled Kxceuw: The
Star;/ of a Hon while behind him a jazz trio played 200 choruses
of Tin Roof lilurs.
" I lerkie,''said I, "come home with me to the artificial cherries."
"No," said Herkie, so sadly I went home to tell Uncle Walter
the had news. Ile wa» less distressed than I had feared, it seems
Uncle Walter has another son, a quiet boy named Edvorts, about
whom he had completely forgotten, and today Edvorts is in
business with Uncle Walter and Herkie is beat in San Francisco,
and everyone is happy.

HOW TO BEAT THE BEAT GENERATION
My cousin Hcrkie Nylet is a sturdy lad of nineteen summers
who lias, we all believed until recently, a lively intelligence and
an assured future. 1 lerkie's father, Walter (). Nylet, is as every
one knows, president of the First National Artificial Cherry
Company, world's largest maker of artificial cherries for ladies'
hats. 1 ticle Walter had great plans for Hcrkie. Last year he
sent Hcrkie to the Maryland College of Humanities, Sciences,
and Artificial Cherries, and lie intended, upon I lerkie's gradu
ation, to find him a nice fat wife and take him into the firm as
a full partner.
('oukl a young man have more pleasing prospects? ()| course
not. Hut a couple of months ago, to everyone's consternation,
I Icrkie announced that he was not going into the artificial cherry
business. Nor was he going to stay in college. "I am," said
Herkie, ''a member of the Beat Generation. 1 am going to San
Francisco and grow a beard."
Well sir, you can imagine the commotion in the family when
Herkie went traipsing off to San Francisco! Uncle Walter would
have gone after him and dragged him home, but unfortunately
he w«s right in the middle of the artificial cherry season. Aunt
Thclina couldn't go either because of her old leg trouble. (One
of her legs is older than the other.)

So I went. 1 searched Snn Francisco for weeks before I found
I lerkie living under the counter of a Pronto Pup stand. "Herkie,
how j)re you?" 1 cried, looking distraughtly upon his tangled
beard, his corduroy jacket, his stricken eyes.
"Beat," s;iid Herkie.
1 offered him a Marlboro and folt instantly better when he
took it because when one smokes Marlboros, one cannot be too
far removed from the world. One still has, so to speak, a hold
on the finer things of life—like good tobacco, like easy-drawing
filtration, like settling back and getting comfortable and enjoy
ing a full-flavored smoke. One is, despite all appearances, basi
cally happiness-oriented, fulfillment-directed, pleasure-prone.
"Herkie, what are you doing with yourself?" 1 asked.
"I am finding myself," lie replied. "I am writing a novel in
the sand with a pointed stick. I am composing a fugue for
clavier and police whistle. 1 am sculpting in experimental ma
terials- like English muffins."
"And what do you do for fun?" I asked.
"Come," he said and took me to a dank little night club
where men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange
crates and drank espresso. ()n a tiny stage stood a poet reciting
a free-form work of his own composition entitled Kxceuw: The
Star;/ of a Hon while behind him a jazz trio played 200 choruses
of Tin Roof lilurs.

"Come," he said and took me to a dank little night club
where men in beards and women in basic burlap sat on orange
crates and drank espresso. ()n a tiny stage stood a poet reciting
a free-form work of his own composition entitled Kxceuw: The

the had news. Ile wa» less distressed than I had feared, it seems
Uncle Walter has another son, a quiet boy named Edvorts, about
whom he had completely forgotten, and today Edvorts is in
business with Uncle Walter and Herkie is beat in San Francisco,
and everyone is happy.
