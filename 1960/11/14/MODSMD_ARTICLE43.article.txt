# Palo Alto Has Own Local Opera Group
## 
### 
Little known on campus but
worthy of student attention is
Palo Alto's West Bay Opera Com
pany.
Drawing singers from San
Francisco to San Jose, the ambi
tious group schedules three full
length productions each year. On
the 21st. 22nd and 23rd of Octo
ber, "La Traviata" was presented
as the first show of this season.
This will be followed by "Die
Fledermaus" by Strauss, sung in
English, on Feb. 17-19 and by
Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rustica
na" and the West Coast premiere
of "The Outcast of Poker Flats,"
both scheduled for May 12-14.
THE GROUP had its beginning
in 1956 when Henry Holt of Palo
Alto presented a recital of oper
atic arias by his students (people
with outstanding talent who lived
in this area). It was so well re
ceived that the idea of forming
a real opera group which would
work with scenery and costumes
crystallized and came into exist
ence as the "Little Opera Guild."
Since the newly-formed group
felt that they had neither the time
nor experience to present full
length shows, their first program,
an "Evening of Opera," consisted
of excerpts from several well
known operas.
In 1957. the West Bay Opera
Association was formed to take
the place of the loosely-knit "Op
era Guild."
Since that time the organiza

tion has expanded to the point
of producing full-length operas, i
Many of its singers have been !
or are professionals, some having j
appeared with the San Francisco !
Opera.
For three years the group op- I
erated without a regular profes- j
sfonal staff. The producer is now j
Gene Chesley, a Stanford grad
uate, who is assisted by costumer
Marie Melinat, also from Stan
ford. Ilolt is the musical direc
tor.
Tickets for the shows are priced
at $2 for the evening perform
ances and $1.50 for the Sunday
matinees. All performances are
held at the Palo Alto Community
Theater on Middlefield in Palo
Alto.

Opera.
For three years the group op- I
erated without a regular profes- j
sfonal staff. The producer is now j
Gene Chesley, a Stanford grad
uate, who is assisted by costumer
Marie Melinat, also from Stan
ford. Ilolt is the musical direc

Tickets for the shows are priced
at $2 for the evening perform

Drawing singers from San

length productions each year. On
the 21st. 22nd and 23rd of Octo
ber, "La Traviata" was presented
as the first show of this season.
This will be followed by "Die
Fledermaus" by Strauss, sung in
English, on Feb. 17-19 and by
Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rustica
na" and the West Coast premiere
of "The Outcast of Poker Flats,"
both scheduled for May 12-14.
THE GROUP had its beginning
in 1956 when Henry Holt of Palo
Alto presented a recital of oper
atic arias by his students (people
with outstanding talent who lived
in this area). It was so well re

a real opera group which would
work with scenery and costumes
crystallized and came into exist

Since the newly-formed group
felt that they had neither the time
nor experience to present full
length shows, their first program,
an "Evening of Opera," consisted
of excerpts from several well
known operas.
In 1957. the West Bay Opera
Association was formed to take
the place of the loosely-knit "Op
era Guild."
Since that time the organiza

tion has expanded to the point
