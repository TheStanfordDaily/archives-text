# Dancers In Many 'Firsts'
## 
### 
The San Francisco Contempo
rary Dancers have been described
as "an enterprising group of mod
ernists." Formed in 1955 with a
treasury of $24.50, the group now
has a parent Foundation and a
Foundation-owned theater which
seats 182.
The key figure in the story of
its growth is J. Marks, the com
pany's foun d e r, director and
choreographer, who insists upon
working independently from the
existing schools of modern dance.
NEVERTHELESS, many out
standing guest performers fre
quently appear in the Founda
tion's theater, located at 1725
Washington St. The theater build
ing itself was built a residence
in the early 1900's and now con
tains a large studio and company
and school offices on the lower
level and the theater on the sec
ond floor.
A list of many premieres is
credited to the Contemporary
Dancers. Some are a full evening
in length, based on novels, plays
and poems and choreographed by
Marks "Crime and Punishment."
"Hedda Gable," "Desire Under
the Elms" and many others. Oth
ers are in a lighter vein—"Puppet !
Show for People," "Mother was
a Piltdown Man" but all reflect
the group's policy of broad ex-J
perimenlation in dance drama.
TWO "FIRSTS" will be pre
sented on Jan. 26, 27 and 28
"Pierrot Lunaire" and "Pomegra
nate Tree"—along with a previ- j
ously-p r e s en t e d work, "Opus
Jazz." Guest artists scheduled to
! appear are Ann Hal pr in and j
Dancers of Marin in a program i
of experiments in modern dance
| Nov. 15, 16, and 17 and the Sergei
iTermoff Ballet Company on Dec.
11 and IS.
All staff members and dancers
are salaried the year 'round.
Tickets for the productions are
priced al $2 and $2.50. The Foun
dation also presents film pro
grams throughout the year. (See
