# North Beach—-An Entertainment Cache
## Beatniks' Last Stand Nears as Beatsville Goes Commercial 
### MARY LOU McKINLEY 
"The North Beach area offers
the densest concentration of
entertainment activities in the
whole, whole world." .So says Jim
Walls, night-life writer for the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Containing every imaginable
kind of entertainment, the area
is devoted to luring the jazz-lover,
the night-owl and the college stu
dent over 21.
The name "North Beach" with
all its connotations is a misnomer,
however. After about five years
of orating and writing in the
North Beach "pads," the beats
are on the move due no doubt
to the rapid commercialization of
the name and the area.
FOUR OR FIVE years ago, in
teresting evenings could bo spent
roaming the streets around Co
lumbus Avenue, sampling the pro
fuse "subterranean" life. Now,
however, only one or two places
are really worthy of the North
Beach reputation.
Only last month San Francis
cans learned that the Bagel Shop
had succumbed to the same fate
as The Place had several months
before. Originally named the Co-
Existence Bagel Shop, this beat
nik stronghold on the coiner of
Green and Grant Streets lasted
six years.
Its fate is representative of the
beatnik's fate in general, in San
Francisco at least—that of com
plete elimination or commercial
ization. The Old Spaghetti Fac
tory chose the latter course.
BIT, WHILE the commercial
establishments have pushed out
the bearded, sandaled generation,
they have drawn in good, re
hearsed entertainment elsewhere
in the Broadway-Columbus area.
As Walls says, "there is certainly
something for every Stanford stu
dent here."
If you must visit Beatsville,
| however, there are still a few
places which merit attention.
Across the street from what
was once the Bagel Shop sits the
; former Miss Smith's Tea Room,
now known as The Tea Room
and Coffee Gallery. Offering pro
! gressive jazz on Wednesdays
through Saturdays from 9 p.m. on
land Sundays from 7 p.m., the
: Coffee Gallery features such en
j tertainers as the Pony Poindexter
' quartet.
MONDAY N I G H T S, cultural
j events such as poetry readings
I and discussions start at 9 o'clock,

and on Tuesdays anyone may par
ticipate in "speak-speak night."
The Coffee Gallery is also notable
in that its walls are filled with
paintings by local artists, the one
man exhibits changing the first
of each month.
The bar serves wine, draft beer
at 30 cents and espresso at 25
cents. Location is 1353 Grant Ave.
A sign in the window at 255
Columbus Ave. says "Booths for
Psychiatrists." And you're apt to
find them here, too, for Vesuvio's
could be called the melting pot
of North Beach, if not of all San
Francisco.
OPEN DAILY at 5 p.m., Yesu
vio's draws a real v a r ie t y of
people -from a few tourists to
the "way out" beats.
One-dollar dinners are available
al the Anxious Asp on Green
Street. Formerly Mary's Hawai
ian Village, the Asp came into
existence about five years ago.
One of the newer Beatsville
hangouts is Mr. Otis, which can
be found on Green Street near
the Asp.
Another Green Street spot is
The Cellar, just recently reopened
after a fire chased out the beat
niks several months ago.
A CHOICE location in the back
of an alley, spaghetti excelsior
with a variety of sauces from
$1.60 to $1.90 and flamenco danc
ing in the adjoining room. This
is The Old Spaghetti Factory Cafe
and Excelsior Coffee House, locat
ed up the alley at 480 Green St.
A bigger favorite among the
collegians than the beats, the
Spaghetti Factory does a brisk
business Monday through Satur
day from 5 p.m.-2 a.m. and on
Sundays from 11:30-2 a.m.
By the time this comes out, the
Spaghetti Factory should be once
again featur ing one of its former
calling-cards — steam beer. Serv
ing spaghetti, sandwiches and
salads until 11 p.m. weekdays and
1 a.m. Friday and Saturday, the
kitchen will furnish seconds on
spaghetti with no charge.
THE FLAMENCO entertain
ment (dancing and guitars) on
Wednesdays and Saturdays be
gins at 11 p.m. and continues
until 1 o'clock in the morning.
Admission is $1.50, next door to
the Spaghetti Factory.
For just plain (and not so
plain) refreshments with no beat
niks and no entertainment, En
rico's is handily located at 504
Broadway.

FROM THE FERRY BUILDING TO CHINATOWN, AN INDESCRIBABLE VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT LURES NICHT-OWLS TO "THE CITY"
"The North Beach area offers
the densest concentration of
entertainment activities in the
whole, whole world." .So says Jim
Walls, night-life writer for the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Containing every imaginable
kind of entertainment, the area
is devoted to luring the jazz-lover,
the night-owl and the college stu
dent over 21.
The name "North Beach" with
all its connotations is a misnomer,
however. After about five years
of orating and writing in the
North Beach "pads," the beats
are on the move due no doubt
to the rapid commercialization of
the name and the area.
FOUR OR FIVE years ago, in
teresting evenings could bo spent
roaming the streets around Co
lumbus Avenue, sampling the pro
fuse "subterranean" life. Now,
however, only one or two places
are really worthy of the North
Beach reputation.
Only last month San Francis
cans learned that the Bagel Shop
had succumbed to the same fate
as The Place had several months
before. Originally named the Co-
Existence Bagel Shop, this beat
nik stronghold on the coiner of
Green and Grant Streets lasted
six years.
Its fate is representative of the
beatnik's fate in general, in San
Francisco at least—that of com
plete elimination or commercial
ization. The Old Spaghetti Fac
tory chose the latter course.
BIT, WHILE the commercial
establishments have pushed out
the bearded, sandaled generation,
they have drawn in good, re
hearsed entertainment elsewhere
in the Broadway-Columbus area.
As Walls says, "there is certainly
something for every Stanford stu
dent here."
If you must visit Beatsville,
| however, there are still a few
places which merit attention.
Across the street from what
was once the Bagel Shop sits the
; former Miss Smith's Tea Room,
now known as The Tea Room
and Coffee Gallery. Offering pro
! gressive jazz on Wednesdays

FROM THE FERRY BUILDING TO CHINATOWN, AN INDESCRIBABLE VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT LURES NICHT-OWLS TO "THE CITY"
"The North Beach area offers
the densest concentration of
entertainment activities in the
whole, whole world." .So says Jim
Walls, night-life writer for the
San Francisco Chronicle.
Containing every imaginable
kind of entertainment, the area
is devoted to luring the jazz-lover,
the night-owl and the college stu
dent over 21.
The name "North Beach" with
all its connotations is a misnomer,
however. After about five years
of orating and writing in the
North Beach "pads," the beats
are on the move due no doubt
to the rapid commercialization of
the name and the area.
FOUR OR FIVE years ago, in
teresting evenings could bo spent
roaming the streets around Co
lumbus Avenue, sampling the pro
fuse "subterranean" life. Now,
however, only one or two places
are really worthy of the North
Beach reputation.
Only last month San Francis
cans learned that the Bagel Shop
had succumbed to the same fate
as The Place had several months
before. Originally named the Co-
Existence Bagel Shop, this beat
nik stronghold on the coiner of
Green and Grant Streets lasted
six years.
Its fate is representative of the
beatnik's fate in general, in San
Francisco at least—that of com
plete elimination or commercial
ization. The Old Spaghetti Fac
tory chose the latter course.
BIT, WHILE the commercial
establishments have pushed out
the bearded, sandaled generation,
they have drawn in good, re
hearsed entertainment elsewhere
in the Broadway-Columbus area.
As Walls says, "there is certainly
something for every Stanford stu
dent here."
If you must visit Beatsville,
| however, there are still a few
places which merit attention.
Across the street from what
was once the Bagel Shop sits the
; former Miss Smith's Tea Room,
now known as The Tea Room
and Coffee Gallery. Offering pro
! gressive jazz on Wednesdays
through Saturdays from 9 p.m. on
land Sundays from 7 p.m., the
: Coffee Gallery features such en
j tertainers as the Pony Poindexter
' quartet.
MONDAY N I G H T S, cultural
j events such as poetry readings
I and discussions start at 9 o'clock,

and on Tuesdays anyone may par
ticipate in "speak-speak night."
The Coffee Gallery is also notable
in that its walls are filled with
paintings by local artists, the one
man exhibits changing the first
of each month.
The bar serves wine, draft beer
at 30 cents and espresso at 25
cents. Location is 1353 Grant Ave.
A sign in the window at 255
Columbus Ave. says "Booths for
Psychiatrists." And you're apt to
find them here, too, for Vesuvio's
could be called the melting pot
of North Beach, if not of all San
Francisco.
OPEN DAILY at 5 p.m., Yesu
vio's draws a real v a r ie t y of
people -from a few tourists to
the "way out" beats.
One-dollar dinners are available
al the Anxious Asp on Green
Street. Formerly Mary's Hawai
ian Village, the Asp came into
existence about five years ago.
One of the newer Beatsville
hangouts is Mr. Otis, which can
be found on Green Street near
the Asp.
Another Green Street spot is
The Cellar, just recently reopened
after a fire chased out the beat
niks several months ago.
A CHOICE location in the back
of an alley, spaghetti excelsior
with a variety of sauces from
$1.60 to $1.90 and flamenco danc
ing in the adjoining room. This
is The Old Spaghetti Factory Cafe
and Excelsior Coffee House, locat
ed up the alley at 480 Green St.
A bigger favorite among the
collegians than the beats, the
Spaghetti Factory does a brisk
business Monday through Satur
day from 5 p.m.-2 a.m. and on
Sundays from 11:30-2 a.m.
