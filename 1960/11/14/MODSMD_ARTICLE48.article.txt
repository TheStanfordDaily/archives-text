# Parking Problem? Try a Cable Car
## 
### 
Once you've decided on the eve
ning's entertainment and have
successfully run the Bayshore
steeplechase, there's always the
problem of where to park in San
Francisco.
For those attending a play or
visiting one of the larger mu
seums, there is usually enough
parking space in one of the many
huge garages in the downtown-
Civic Center area. For those who
want a leisurely stroll down
Broadway, through Chinatown or
North Beach, however, it's more
of a problem.
One of the ways to beat this
problem is to leave your car to
the garage attendants and make
use of the public transportation
system the cable cars, streetcars
and busesâ€”which is a good 15-1
cent way to get around the city.
Three cable car lines are still
in operation and provide a won
derful way to see San Francisco
when you're not in a hurry.
The Powell cable ("Fisherman's |
Wharf-Bay and Taylor") runs up
Powell, makes a left turn at Jack

son and, al Mason, cuts through
sections of Chinatown and North
Beach. The end of the line is just
a few blocks from Fisherman's
Wharf.
Anol h e r Powell cable car
("Aquatic Park-Hyde and Beach"
line) turns off Jackson onto Ilyde
and slides down .Russian Hill to
a point near Aquatic Park.
The third line starts at the cor
ner of California and Market,
rolls through the financial dis
trict, up Nob Hill, and ends at
Van Ness Avenue.
The three principal taxi com
panies in San Francisco are the
Yellow (T.Uxedo 5-1234), DeSoto
(ORdway 3-1414) and Luxor
(ORdway 3-4040). You'll see many
others, too, all of which have a
minimum charge of 50 cents.
If you prefer to do your own
driving and happen to miss a
turn onto the freeway or end up
wandering around in Golden Gate
Park, call Fillmore 6-5656 and ask
for Information. The expert ques
tion answerers for the Municipal
Railway will direct you to where
you want to go within minutes.
