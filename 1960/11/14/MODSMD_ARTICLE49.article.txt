# S.F. Among World's Gourmet Capitals
## All Nationalities Represented by 3,000 Restaurants 
### 
Tommy's Joynt, tTie Blue Fox, Orison's, Trader Vic's, New Joe's,
Schroeder's Cafe, Julius' Castle, Kan's, Ernie's—over 3.000 restau
rants, dozens of them excellent, scores of them very good and hun
dreds above average. San Francisco, one of the gourmet capitals of
the world.
And they offer you a choice of the world's cookery -— French,

Italian, Chinese predominate; but
there are American restaurants,
German, Indian and Japanese
restaurants; Mexican, Polynesian
and Spanish restaurants.
There are plush Victorian ex
pensive restaurants, there are
very, very inexpensive restau
rants with a wide variety of gen
uine atmosphere. There are res
taurants descended from Gold
Rush days, restaurants with
strolling violinists, restaurants
with turban-clad waiters and a
restaurant "Across the Street
from the Morgue."
And San Francisco — Queen
City of the Golden Gate — has
foods that are uniquely her own.
For the Bay provides her chefs
with fresh cracked crab, tiny bay
s hr i m p and abalone . . . and
few places have so u r d o u g h
French bread like that in San
Francisco.
A city of restaurants: but in
most cases you should he sure to
make a reservation, for San Fran
cisco is an "eating" city and most
of the restaurants are crowded
nightly.
With 3000 to choose from,
where do you start?
FOR ELEGANCE, FINE FOOD
For a very special occasion, or
if price is no object, or you just
want one of the nicer restaurants
in the City, there are any number
to choose from, where the food
is excellent, the service good.
