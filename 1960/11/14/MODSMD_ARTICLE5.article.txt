# Pom Pon Girls' Vivacious Spirits Not Dampened by Rain or Defeat
## 
### GREGG HOPKINS 
Neither driving rain nor driving football opponents can dim the flashing smiles of Stanford's cele
brated pom pon girls, 1960 edition. They proved it Saturday when they pranced under umbrellas in
their last warmup before Big Game. Wendy Anderson. Lana Caffey, Kathy Page, Pat Murman and
Suzanne Horney (as they line up from left to right) were picked from 25 hopefuls last spring by last
year's pom pon girls, yell leader Phil Iluyck, ASSU President Larry Royse and Rally representatives.

Blonde sophomore Wend y,
speaking for all five says,"I
never had more fun in my life,"
is a prospective nurse from
Evansville, Indiana. "I went into
pom poning." she says, "because
I can't stand to sit still at a
game."
I,ANA, a junior, is "Mom" to
her four sophomore cohorts. She
went from her home in San
Mateo to Mills College and trans
ferred back to Ihe right side of
the Bay last year. She (along
with Pat) danced in "Kismet"
last spring. Lagunita is home for
Lana and Wendy.
Suzanne comes from Atherton
and will major in art. The sun
tanned Hurlburt beauty was
Dartmouth Winter Carnival
queen last winter.
PAT, a soph education major
from Burbank, refused to prom
ise a Big Game win, but came
about as close as possible.
Fellow Flo Mo resident Kathy
remarked that with 10 hours
weekly practice time, including
two evenings' marching with the
band, pom poning amounts to
about 3 extra units this quarter.
"No activity credits, either," she
lamented.
