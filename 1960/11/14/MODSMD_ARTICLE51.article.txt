# Palo Alto Features Small—But Good-Variety of Nite-Life
## 
### 
While Palo Alto offers a mini
mum of night-owl entertainment
within its city limits, there arc
still several places in the are.i
which deserve attention and
should not be overlooked.
First on this list is Redwood
City's Pagliacchi, located at 2901
El Camino. Featuring atmosphere
and entertainment which could
rival several of the better-known
San Francisco night s|H>ts. the
Pagliacchi is unfortunately open
to only those over 21.
FEATURING four shows
nightly, from 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.,
on Wednesdays through Satur
days, the one-of-its-kind in this
area started out on Aug. 3. 1956.
It soon attracted several on-the
rise folk-singing groups the
Kingston Trio made its jump to
the hungry i from here and also
became known for its Gilbert and
Sullivan shows.
Called t lie Pagliacchi Players,
the Gilbert and Sullivan group
has given over 100 Sunday night
performances at the Pagliacchi.
Composed of professional singers,
some of whom have sung with
the San Francisco Opera, the 23-
member company hopes to branch
out into other old musicals (such
as Victor Herbert shows) this
year.
The more-conventional enter
tainment includes folk - singing
groups and individuals and an
operatic quartet with an accent
on comedy.
AT PRESENT, The Noblemen
are entertaining with a bass, two
guitars and Kingston Trio-type
music. Another folk-singer, Sally
Smaller, rounds out the program
with a lovely voice. If this pro
gram is typical of Pagliacchi en
tertainment. there's no need to
drive all the way to San Fran
cisco for an enjoyable evening.
The owner and manager, Paul
Albertson, also plays the piano
and accompanies the singers.
Beer can be purchased for 30-40
cents, and drinks are 50 cents
before the show, 15 cents during
and after. The minimal cover
charge varies from 50 cents to $1.
depending on the current show.
Located at 642 High St. in Palo
Alto, Outside at the Inside has
just recently switched to a big
name policy in jazz entertain
ment. Established just last year,
the "dry" night spot has zoomed
to a position where it can feature
such names as Cal Tjader, Barney
Kessel and Red Norvo.
DIVERGING from the current
"cellar" trend in San Francisco
night clubs, Outside at the Inside
is located upstairs and derives its
name from the no-ceiling, pent
house atmosphere.
Luncheons are served Monday
through Friday from 12 to 2 p.m.;
dinners, from 6 to 10 p.m., and
the evening entertainment begins
at 9 o'clock.
The cover charge varies but is
usually $2 on Friday and Satur
day and on Thursday when spe
cial entertainment is featured.
Sunday and Monday the charge
is $1 and on Wednesday, $1.50.
Hi-fi concerts are held on Sun
day from 2 to 5 p.m. and are free
of charge. (Chess is also played
S un d a y afternoons.) Assorted
coffees are available from 35 to
80 cents along with other non
alcoholic concoctions.
A SMALL but rising jazz spot
in Palo Alto can be found on
University Avenue, just on the
other side of the underpass near
Ihe circle. Known as The Black
Cat, the place offers jazz on Fri
day and Saturday nights from

10:30 p.m. and on Sundays from
4 p.m.
Nearly as familiar to Stanford
students as Hoover Tower, Kcp-
Jer's on p]l Camino in Menlo Park
is more than a bookstore. Behind
the hook racks on one side of the
store, browsers can refresh with
any one of a number of coffees,
hot drinks, pastries, sandwiches
and salads.
Frequently, aspiring folksitig
ers and guitarists hold practice
sessions in the coffee "house,"
and discussions may be held on
I a variety of topics.
i Open at 10 a.m. (noon on Sun
! iays i, Kepler's refreshment room
| serves lunches from 11:15 a.m.,
| closes from mid-afternoon to 7:30
j p.m., and opens again for late

I urdays.

' paperback books, Kepler's moved

THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF OUTSIDE AT THE INSIDE
Palo Alto's "dry" night-club features big«name entertainers
While Palo Alto offers a mini
mum of night-owl entertainment
within its city limits, there arc
still several places in the are.i
which deserve attention and
should not be overlooked.
First on this list is Redwood
City's Pagliacchi, located at 2901
El Camino. Featuring atmosphere
and entertainment which could
rival several of the better-known
San Francisco night s|H>ts. the
Pagliacchi is unfortunately open
to only those over 21.
FEATURING four shows
nightly, from 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.,
on Wednesdays through Satur
days, the one-of-its-kind in this
area started out on Aug. 3. 1956.
It soon attracted several on-the
rise folk-singing groups the
Kingston Trio made its jump to
the hungry i from here and also
became known for its Gilbert and
Sullivan shows.
Called t lie Pagliacchi Players,
the Gilbert and Sullivan group
has given over 100 Sunday night
performances at the Pagliacchi.
Composed of professional singers,
some of whom have sung with
the San Francisco Opera, the 23-
member company hopes to branch
out into other old musicals (such
as Victor Herbert shows) this
year.
The more-conventional enter
tainment includes folk - singing
groups and individuals and an
operatic quartet with an accent
on comedy.
AT PRESENT, The Noblemen
are entertaining with a bass, two
guitars and Kingston Trio-type
music. Another folk-singer, Sally
Smaller, rounds out the program
with a lovely voice. If this pro
gram is typical of Pagliacchi en
tertainment. there's no need to
drive all the way to San Fran
cisco for an enjoyable evening.
The owner and manager, Paul
Albertson, also plays the piano
and accompanies the singers.
Beer can be purchased for 30-40
cents, and drinks are 50 cents
before the show, 15 cents during
and after. The minimal cover
charge varies from 50 cents to $1.

THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF OUTSIDE AT THE INSIDE
Palo Alto's "dry" night-club features big«name entertainers
While Palo Alto offers a mini
mum of night-owl entertainment
within its city limits, there arc
still several places in the are.i
which deserve attention and
should not be overlooked.
First on this list is Redwood
City's Pagliacchi, located at 2901
El Camino. Featuring atmosphere
and entertainment which could
rival several of the better-known
San Francisco night s|H>ts. the
Pagliacchi is unfortunately open
to only those over 21.
FEATURING four shows
nightly, from 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m.,
on Wednesdays through Satur
days, the one-of-its-kind in this
area started out on Aug. 3. 1956.
It soon attracted several on-the
rise folk-singing groups the
Kingston Trio made its jump to
the hungry i from here and also
became known for its Gilbert and
Sullivan shows.
Called t lie Pagliacchi Players,
the Gilbert and Sullivan group
has given over 100 Sunday night
performances at the Pagliacchi.
Composed of professional singers,
some of whom have sung with
the San Francisco Opera, the 23-
member company hopes to branch
out into other old musicals (such
as Victor Herbert shows) this
year.
The more-conventional enter
tainment includes folk - singing
groups and individuals and an
operatic quartet with an accent
on comedy.
AT PRESENT, The Noblemen
are entertaining with a bass, two
guitars and Kingston Trio-type
music. Another folk-singer, Sally
Smaller, rounds out the program
with a lovely voice. If this pro
gram is typical of Pagliacchi en
tertainment. there's no need to
drive all the way to San Fran
cisco for an enjoyable evening.
The owner and manager, Paul
Albertson, also plays the piano
and accompanies the singers.
Beer can be purchased for 30-40
cents, and drinks are 50 cents
before the show, 15 cents during
and after. The minimal cover
charge varies from 50 cents to $1.
depending on the current show.
Located at 642 High St. in Palo
Alto, Outside at the Inside has
just recently switched to a big
name policy in jazz entertain
ment. Established just last year,
the "dry" night spot has zoomed
to a position where it can feature
such names as Cal Tjader, Barney
Kessel and Red Norvo.
DIVERGING from the current
"cellar" trend in San Francisco
night clubs, Outside at the Inside
is located upstairs and derives its
name from the no-ceiling, pent
house atmosphere.
Luncheons are served Monday
through Friday from 12 to 2 p.m.;
dinners, from 6 to 10 p.m., and
the evening entertainment begins
at 9 o'clock.
The cover charge varies but is
usually $2 on Friday and Satur
day and on Thursday when spe
cial entertainment is featured.
Sunday and Monday the charge
is $1 and on Wednesday, $1.50.
Hi-fi concerts are held on Sun
day from 2 to 5 p.m. and are free
of charge. (Chess is also played
S un d a y afternoons.) Assorted
coffees are available from 35 to
80 cents along with other non
alcoholic concoctions.
A SMALL but rising jazz spot
in Palo Alto can be found on
University Avenue, just on the
other side of the underpass near
Ihe circle. Known as The Black
Cat, the place offers jazz on Fri
day and Saturday nights from

10:30 p.m. and on Sundays from
4 p.m.
Nearly as familiar to Stanford
students as Hoover Tower, Kcp-
Jer's on p]l Camino in Menlo Park
is more than a bookstore. Behind
the hook racks on one side of the
store, browsers can refresh with
any one of a number of coffees,
hot drinks, pastries, sandwiches
and salads.
Frequently, aspiring folksitig
ers and guitarists hold practice
sessions in the coffee "house,"
and discussions may be held on
I a variety of topics.
