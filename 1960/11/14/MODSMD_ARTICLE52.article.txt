## Foreign, Art Film Theaters Thrive in Bay Area Climate 
### 
On Aug. 12 the Belmont Art
! Theater opened, the newest in the
recent surge of art, specialty and
foreign film theaters in the San
Francisco-Peninsula area.
Indicative of the Bay Area's re
ceptive climate, there are now
more than a dozen theaters offer
ing the unusual in film entertain
ment every weekend.
In addition to the regular the
aters, the only international film
festival in the United States is
held in San Francisco each year.
The 1960 Festival began Oct. 19
; at the Metro Theater and con
tinued through Nov. 2.
THIS YEAR'S festival included
| the first entry from the Soviet
j Union. One of the three final
| judges in the competition "Film
I as Communication" this year was
j Stanford instructor in cinematog
| raphy Henry Breitrose,
A civic, non-profit enterprise,'
j the Film Festival began in 19371
and has grown steadily, in both;
i size and prestige, since then. That |
j first year, 16 features from 12
I countries were shown. The same
number were entered in 1958,
while last year's offerings rose
to 24 from 19 different countries.
FOLK OF the area's art and|
specialty film theaters are under
the direction of the Herbert Rose-!
ner Co. which also operates in
Los Angeles and New York.
Two of these, the Larkin and;
New Clay, were the two original!
j art theaters in the Bay Area. The
Stage Door is the third in the
j family and became famous for 1
its Stage Door Canteen record |
during World War 11.
The fourth Rosener theater in
jthe area is the recently-opened'
Belmont Art theater. Since it is a
"combination art and specialty!
type of theater," the Belmont Art
features non-importations as well!
as some foreign films. At press
time two German films, "The Beg
gar Student" and"The Captain
from Kocpenick" were showing.
The theater is located on El Ca-:
mino at North Road in Belmont.
THE PICTURE "Nudist Story" j
has been the attraction at the,
