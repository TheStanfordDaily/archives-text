# Spaeth to Give Talk on India
## 
### 
Carl B. Spaeth, dean of the
Stanford School of Law, will
speak on "India: 1950 to
1960" in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium tomorrow night at
7:30.
Spaeth returned earlier
this year - from a six months'
stay in India where he served
as a consultant to the Indian
Law Institute at New Delhi
in order to make a study of
Indian legal education.
Spaeth's recent trip to
India was his third in a little
more than 10 years. On
earlier occasions he went to
India as director of Overseas
Activities for the Ford Foun
dation, where he was con
cerned with efforts of the
Foundation to assist India
in programs that ranged
from agricultural develop
ment to aid to higher educa
tion.
His talk, which is part
of the Tuesday Evening
Series, will be open to the
public free of charge.
