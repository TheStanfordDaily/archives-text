# La. Integration Showdown Set This Morning
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (UPIi—A fed
eral judge issued an order last
night restraining the Louisiana
Legislature from using state po
lice to keep five Negro girls from
integrating New Orleans schools
today.
Judge J. Skelly Wright issued
the order at the request of the
New Orleans School Board, which
announced it would open today
"no matter what."
THE FIVE Negroes are sched
uled to enter first grade classes in
two all-white elementary schools
at 6:45 a.m. (PST).
The restraining order bars the
Louisiana Legislature "and each
individual member of it"and
"their agents, employes, and those
acting in concert with them" from
enforcing the three resolutions
passed last night or to otherwise
interfere with integration.
SCHOOL board attorney Sam
Rosenberg said that if the Legis
lature passes more resolutions,
he will ask Wright to rule them
out too.
But segregation leaders indi
cated they would ignore Wright's
order and proceed as if it had not
been issued.
"He hasn't got the right . . . it's
I unheard of," gasped one legisla
tor. "I nor any body with a slight
knowledge of law has ever heard
of a judge enjoining a legisla
ture."
FOREMOST among the three,
passed in an emergency session of
the Legislature in Baton Rouge,
was a resolution declaring a
school holiday today and author
izing "sergeants at arms"—prob
ably state police to be sent to
every school in New Orleans to
prevent anyone from entering
them.
State segregation leaders were
stunned. "That was totally unex
pected," said one of the chief
House whips. Another legislator
said Judge Wright is "apparently
running the entire stale now."
