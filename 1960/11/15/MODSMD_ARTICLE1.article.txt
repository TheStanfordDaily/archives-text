# Axe History Enlivened by Robberies, Battles

### RANDY MILLEN 
The history of the Stanford Axe is a long one, rich in
colorful, historical events which now, 61 years after the
original Axe first appeared, have become almost legendary.
'Way back in 1869, two enterprising Stanfordites, Will
Bradley and Willie Irwin originated the Axe Yell. This
yell, used at campus rallies, did not commemorate any
particular material axe. However, it was not long before
people stal led asking, "Why don't we get a real axe?"
So a broad-bladed lumberman's axe, shaped like a toma
hawk, was located and brought to the Farm. Its 15-inch
blade was decorated with a big red "S" and attached to
a long wooden handle.
THE AXi: WAS first brought out officially at a base
ball rally on April 14, 1899. At that, time a three-game base
ball series was held in San Francisco between the Cards
and the Bruins. UC had won one game, and needed but one
more to clinch the series.
Spirit was running high at that rally. Stanford students
roared as the Axe was sharpened on a grindstone and used
to cut off the head of a dummy bear.
In the game the next day, practically the entire student
body turned out. Head Yell Leader Bill Erb waved the Axe
in the air all through the game, often nearly shaving the
faces of the Cal rooters. It was to no avail, however, Stan
ford lost the game, 9-7.
As the three guardians of the Axe, the last to leave the

ball park, stepped out onto Folsom Avenue, they were ac
costed by four Californians, who demanded the Axe.
IX THE MIDST OF THE ensuing scuffle, Cal's Paul
Castlethum yanked the Axe form Carl Hayden's hands.
The star member of the Bear track team tried to make
away with the Axe, but Frank Strout, an heroic Stanford
hurdler, grabbed the trophy and headed out.
He did not get far, however, for, putting on a nefarious
burst of speed, Jimmy Hopper, Cal's off-season quarter
back, threw a flying tackle, and Stanford lost the Axe
again. When last •seen it was being carried away in a
delivery wagon.
A last-ditch effort was made to apprehend the Calsters
at the Oakland ferry. Police and red-shirted Stanfordites
threw a cordon around the ferry slip and searched each
person going across the Bay.
LUCK AND QUICK wits helped the Bear who had the
axe, however. He spotted a girl-friend of his amid the
crowd, and, after a moment of conniving, the two of them
boarded the boat arm-in-arm with the Axe concealed some
where about her person. Thus the Axe-bearers managed to
elude pursuit and convey the Axe to Berkeley.
Th next night a rally was held at Cal, commemorating
the theft, at which care of the Axe was entrusted to the
Chi Psi House, home of the football team captain.
But at 2 a.m. the members of the fraternity were
awakened by a hammering on the door: 50 loyal Stanford
ites were breaking in with a battering-ram. The Axe had

been well hidden, though, and, ransack the house as they
might, the Cards could not find it.
From then on the Axe remained, jealously guarded, on
the Cal campus. A few attempts were made to retake it,
but these were never successful.
Until, 31 years later, the "Immortal 21" from Stanford
University, whose exploits are now celebrated throughout
the land in song and story, wrested the Axe away from the
Calsters. On April 3, 1930. this daring band re-took the
Axe and brought it back in triumph to its rightful home
on the Fa I'm.
THE RAID WAS a violent one, and though the "21"
were local heroes, there was fear or reprisals and possible
future violence. To prevent this, a plan was offei-ed whew
by the Axe would become the trophy for the winner of the
Big Game.
This plan was met with total opposition by the Stan
fordites. The "21" took a unanimous vote against it. The
Daily took an editorial stand in opposition, pointing out
that it was only common sense that we should retain the
Axe.
After all. it was ours to begin with. Other Stanfordites
were heard to mutter that it was only just that, if we had
to put up the Axe as a trophy, Berkeley should put up its
Golden Bear—winner take all.
But Cal would not have it so. The executive manager
of the UC alumni organization swore a solemn oath that

they would have the Axe back if it took them a hundred
years.
THE AXE DISAPPEARED from Stanford in 1933, and
the administrations of the two universities stepped in to
end tiie fun. A pact was drawn up, and signed, making the
Axe t lie official Big Game trophy.
Suspension from school for anyone caught trying to
steal the Axe was an integral part of the agreement. This
treaty on non-aggression was the beginning of another
great Cal-Stanford tradition.
Nothing eventful happened until 1946, when four Berke
ley students took the blade from its resting-place in a
case on the wall of the Cellar. Stanfordites were heard to
voice threats of going over to steal the Cal cyclotron in
retaliation. However, the Axe was found in a prowl car
outside the Palo Alto police station in time for the game.
In an attempt to prevent future thefts, California spent
$700 on a 900-pound case with an unbreakable glass win
dow. However, in 1948 the Axe was taken from its current
resting place at the Berkeley campus and later found
abandoned under a tree on the Stanford Golf Course.
AGAIN IN 1953, during spring finals week, the Axe dis
appeared from Cal. The glass in the case had been broken,
the Axe removed—and a $5 bill left in payment for repairs
to the glass! The Axe turned up just before the Big Game
in team captain Norm Manoogian's car.
Cal has had the Axe now legally—for the past three
years. But this year—THlS YEAR—it's coming back to
the Farm! ! !
