# The 						Berlin Situation
## 
### ROSS JOHNSON IIR Political Analyst 
Preoccupation with the ques
tions of Cuba and Quemoy and
Matsu during October, fostered
by the "Great Debates." permitted
a definite pattern of Communist
threats to West Berlin and a fun
damental shift in West Berlin's
attitude towards safeguarding
her future to develop largely un
noticed in this country.
Early in the fall, barge traffic
to Berlin from West Germany,
supplying one-third of the iso
lated city's needs, had been sus
pended by the East German au
thorities for eight days, ostensi
bly because the canal levels were
too low.
Simultaneously, East German
police began to regulate intersec
tor travel within Berlin, accepting
West German passports and even
credentials of some diplomats ac
credited to the Bonn government.
These measures were regarded
in Berlin as a revival of the con
tinuous Communist attempt,
since the failure of the Berlin
blockade in 1949, to demonstrate
both the vulnerability of Berlin's
supply lines and the anachronism
of four-power status in Berlin
and thus to force a redefinition
of West Berlin's status, at the
very least making it a free city,
somewhat like Danzig between
the wars.
But with Dr. Adenauer vaca
tioning in Italy, British and
French indifference, and ambigu
ous American reaction, the only
countermeasures were two pro
tests by the Allied commandants
in Berlin to their Russian coun
terpart.
With his return to the Federal
Chancellory in Bonn, Adenauer
seemed suddenly to end Western
vacillation with an announcement
of Sept. 30 that the annual West
German trade pact with East Ger
many would be renegotiated only
if free movement to Berlin were
guaranteed.
The credulity of this embargo
threat to the Communists could
be doubted. Western justification
for the trade agreements has
been the opportunity they pro
vide to keep connections with the
East open. If an embargo should
occur, East Germany would have
little trouble substituting im
ports, most essentially steel and
chemicals, from other countries.
The threatened embargo ap
peared merely an invitation to
the East German regime to reaf
firm its right of control over non-
Allied supplies carried over the
access routes to Berlin.
Other events throughout Octo
ber likewise showed increasing

West German acceptance of a
weakening position in Berlin. The
East Germans have continued to
regulate traffic between East and
West Berlin, implying further
Western acceptance of the de
facto and of four-power status in
Greater Berlin.
Adenauer's actions have re
vealed a policy of avoiding any
assertions of Western influences
in Berlin that might be regarded
as provocations by the East Ger
man regime. Rallies of former
Wehrmacht soldiers and refugee
groups scheduled for Berlin were
cancelled.
The West. German Parliament
did not hold its annual symbolic
meeting in the old German capi
tal. The Parliament also author
ized Adenauer to modify plans to
locate the administrative head
quarters of a new federal radio
station in Berlin.
The acquiescences of the Bonn
government have been viewed
with alarm in West Berlin. In the
latest protest, >1 ayor Willy
Brandt's German Socialist Party
bitterly opposed in Parliament
the decision not to locate the new
radio headquarters in Berlin.
Fearful of a continuing squeeze
that would not be opposed by the
West until it had progressed dan
gerously far, Brandt has support
ed British Prime Minister Mac
millan's call for a summit confer
ence early in 1961, presumably in
the hope of gaining clear Soviet
guarantees of West Berlin's free
access routes.
This marks a sharp departure
from the united German opinion
opposing discussion of Berlin at
the Paris summit conference in
May, believing that the West
could only lose ground in any
negotiations.
Yet, although Russian and Brit
ish influence will likely necessi
tate thorough discussion of Ber
lin, in spite of Adenauer's opposi
tion, after Kennedy takes office,
Russian guarantees will offer no
more assurance than the present
Western acceptance of changes in
the status quo that West Berlin's
supply routes will remain unmo
lested for long.
For the price of such Soviet
guarantees, discussed on a basis
of Western acceptance of the
changes since last summer, would
doubtless be increased Western
recognition of East German sov
ereignty—regardless of whether
peace treaties are signed with the
two Germanics by the anti-Nazi
powers. Then, even though the
Western military deterrent might
still prevent overt sanctions
against Berlin, the city would be
increasingly vulnerable to piece
meal encroachments.

meal encroachments.
Preoccupation with the ques
tions of Cuba and Quemoy and
Matsu during October, fostered
by the "Great Debates." permitted
a definite pattern of Communist
threats to West Berlin and a fun
damental shift in West Berlin's
attitude towards safeguarding
her future to develop largely un
noticed in this country.
Early in the fall, barge traffic
to Berlin from West Germany,
supplying one-third of the iso
lated city's needs, had been sus
pended by the East German au
thorities for eight days, ostensi
bly because the canal levels were
too low.
Simultaneously, East German
police began to regulate intersec
tor travel within Berlin, accepting
West German passports and even
credentials of some diplomats ac
credited to the Bonn government.
These measures were regarded
in Berlin as a revival of the con
tinuous Communist attempt,
since the failure of the Berlin
blockade in 1949, to demonstrate
both the vulnerability of Berlin's
supply lines and the anachronism
of four-power status in Berlin
and thus to force a redefinition
of West Berlin's status, at the
very least making it a free city,
somewhat like Danzig between
the wars.
But with Dr. Adenauer vaca
tioning in Italy, British and
French indifference, and ambigu
ous American reaction, the only
countermeasures were two pro
tests by the Allied commandants
in Berlin to their Russian coun
terpart.
With his return to the Federal
Chancellory in Bonn, Adenauer
seemed suddenly to end Western
vacillation with an announcement
of Sept. 30 that the annual West
German trade pact with East Ger
many would be renegotiated only
if free movement to Berlin were
guaranteed.
The credulity of this embargo
threat to the Communists could
be doubted. Western justification
for the trade agreements has
been the opportunity they pro
vide to keep connections with the
East open. If an embargo should
occur, East Germany would have
little trouble substituting im
ports, most essentially steel and
chemicals, from other countries.
The threatened embargo ap
peared merely an invitation to
the East German regime to reaf
firm its right of control over non-
Allied supplies carried over the
access routes to Berlin.
Other events throughout Octo
ber likewise showed increasing

West German acceptance of a
weakening position in Berlin. The
East Germans have continued to
regulate traffic between East and
West Berlin, implying further
Western acceptance of the de
facto and of four-power status in
Greater Berlin.
Adenauer's actions have re
vealed a policy of avoiding any
assertions of Western influences
in Berlin that might be regarded
as provocations by the East Ger
man regime. Rallies of former
Wehrmacht soldiers and refugee
groups scheduled for Berlin were
cancelled.
The West. German Parliament
did not hold its annual symbolic
meeting in the old German capi
tal. The Parliament also author
ized Adenauer to modify plans to
locate the administrative head
quarters of a new federal radio
station in Berlin.
The acquiescences of the Bonn
government have been viewed
with alarm in West Berlin. In the
latest protest, >1 ayor Willy
Brandt's German Socialist Party
bitterly opposed in Parliament
the decision not to locate the new
radio headquarters in Berlin.
Fearful of a continuing squeeze
that would not be opposed by the
West until it had progressed dan
gerously far, Brandt has support
ed British Prime Minister Mac
millan's call for a summit confer
ence early in 1961, presumably in
the hope of gaining clear Soviet
guarantees of West Berlin's free
access routes.
This marks a sharp departure
from the united German opinion
opposing discussion of Berlin at
the Paris summit conference in
May, believing that the West
could only lose ground in any
negotiations.
Yet, although Russian and Brit
ish influence will likely necessi
tate thorough discussion of Ber
lin, in spite of Adenauer's opposi
tion, after Kennedy takes office,
Russian guarantees will offer no
more assurance than the present
Western acceptance of changes in
the status quo that West Berlin's
supply routes will remain unmo
lested for long.
For the price of such Soviet
guarantees, discussed on a basis
of Western acceptance of the
changes since last summer, would
doubtless be increased Western
recognition of East German sov
ereignty—regardless of whether
peace treaties are signed with the
two Germanics by the anti-Nazi
powers. Then, even though the
Western military deterrent might
still prevent overt sanctions
against Berlin, the city would be
increasingly vulnerable to piece

Preoccupation with the ques
tions of Cuba and Quemoy and
Matsu during October, fostered
by the "Great Debates." permitted
a definite pattern of Communist
threats to West Berlin and a fun
damental shift in West Berlin's
attitude towards safeguarding
her future to develop largely un
noticed in this country.
Early in the fall, barge traffic
to Berlin from West Germany,
supplying one-third of the iso
lated city's needs, had been sus
pended by the East German au
thorities for eight days, ostensi
bly because the canal levels were
too low.
Simultaneously, East German
police began to regulate intersec
tor travel within Berlin, accepting
West German passports and even
credentials of some diplomats ac
credited to the Bonn government.
These measures were regarded
in Berlin as a revival of the con
tinuous Communist attempt,
since the failure of the Berlin
blockade in 1949, to demonstrate
both the vulnerability of Berlin's
supply lines and the anachronism
of four-power status in Berlin
and thus to force a redefinition
of West Berlin's status, at the
very least making it a free city,
somewhat like Danzig between
the wars.
But with Dr. Adenauer vaca
tioning in Italy, British and
French indifference, and ambigu
ous American reaction, the only
countermeasures were two pro
tests by the Allied commandants
in Berlin to their Russian coun
terpart.
With his return to the Federal
Chancellory in Bonn, Adenauer
seemed suddenly to end Western
vacillation with an announcement
of Sept. 30 that the annual West
German trade pact with East Ger
many would be renegotiated only
if free movement to Berlin were
guaranteed.
The credulity of this embargo
threat to the Communists could
be doubted. Western justification
for the trade agreements has
been the opportunity they pro
vide to keep connections with the
East open. If an embargo should
occur, East Germany would have
little trouble substituting im
ports, most essentially steel and
chemicals, from other countries.
The threatened embargo ap
peared merely an invitation to
the East German regime to reaf
firm its right of control over non-
Allied supplies carried over the
access routes to Berlin.
Other events throughout Octo
ber likewise showed increasing

West German acceptance of a
weakening position in Berlin. The
East Germans have continued to
regulate traffic between East and
West Berlin, implying further
Western acceptance of the de
facto and of four-power status in
Greater Berlin.
Adenauer's actions have re
vealed a policy of avoiding any
assertions of Western influences
in Berlin that might be regarded
as provocations by the East Ger
man regime. Rallies of former
Wehrmacht soldiers and refugee
groups scheduled for Berlin were
cancelled.
The West. German Parliament
did not hold its annual symbolic
meeting in the old German capi
tal. The Parliament also author
ized Adenauer to modify plans to
locate the administrative head
quarters of a new federal radio
station in Berlin.
The acquiescences of the Bonn
government have been viewed
with alarm in West Berlin. In the
latest protest, >1 ayor Willy
Brandt's German Socialist Party
bitterly opposed in Parliament
the decision not to locate the new
radio headquarters in Berlin.
Fearful of a continuing squeeze
that would not be opposed by the
West until it had progressed dan
gerously far, Brandt has support
ed British Prime Minister Mac
millan's call for a summit confer
ence early in 1961, presumably in
the hope of gaining clear Soviet
guarantees of West Berlin's free
access routes.
This marks a sharp departure
from the united German opinion
opposing discussion of Berlin at
the Paris summit conference in
May, believing that the West
could only lose ground in any
negotiations.
Yet, although Russian and Brit
ish influence will likely necessi
tate thorough discussion of Ber
lin, in spite of Adenauer's opposi
tion, after Kennedy takes office,
Russian guarantees will offer no
more assurance than the present
Western acceptance of changes in
the status quo that West Berlin's
supply routes will remain unmo
lested for long.
For the price of such Soviet
guarantees, discussed on a basis
of Western acceptance of the
changes since last summer, would
doubtless be increased Western
recognition of East German sov
ereignty—regardless of whether
peace treaties are signed with the
two Germanics by the anti-Nazi
powers. Then, even though the
Western military deterrent might
still prevent overt sanctions
against Berlin, the city would be
increasingly vulnerable to piece
meal encroachments.
