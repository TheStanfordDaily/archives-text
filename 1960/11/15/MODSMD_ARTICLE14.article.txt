Editor, the Dully:
Now that the Messiah has been
duly chosen by his people, it is
apparently time for the editor of
the peninsula's only morning
newspaper to impugn the system
of choice. He has proposed the
direct ballot, a device susceptible
to rule by that desultory monster,
the Mob. In answer to his icono
clastic suggestions I submit that
only a small refinement of the
present electoral college is neces
sary.
My system, the Electoral Uni
versity, would consist of the pres
ent Electoral College supplement
ed by a committee of seven mem
bers which would assign to each
state a "maturity factor," a num
ber between zero and one by
which the electoral vote of that
state would be multiplied. For ex
ample, southern states might be
assigned the number one-half,
simply because people there have
not learned to vote properly.
Similarly California might receive
the number seven-eighths due to
the rampant idiocy extant
throughout the state.
The committee would be com
posed of two members of the
People's Committee to Free Earl
Browder, two former members of
the Amerikadeutscher Volksbund,
and three members of the Wom
an's League of Voters. Of course
an element of personal bias might
exist in such a committee, but an
Electoral University would un
doubtedly direct the venerated
system of checks and balances
that is now the government of
some people, by worse people, and
for mothers and children; toward
a government of good people, by

better people, and for mothers
and children.
Philip L. 1 lower
Editor, the Daily:
In his letter of 11-9-60 Mr. War
ner Tan asserts that, "When a
graduate looks for a job, the two
main things interviewers look at
are personality and grades." It
would seem that an individual's
integrity is of no importance, that
a person with good grades and
a pleasing smile will get the job.
I ask of Mr. Tan: what business
firm or which of the various pro
fessional groups would desire,
much less accept, a person of
doubtful integrity? But then may
be I am wrong, perhaps an Honor
Code violation casts no shadow
on an individual's integrity. Per
haps a person starts life after
college, with a clean slate, with
no hint of what he might do in
the future because the past
doesn't affect the future.
I deny the validity of the last
two conjectures. No one wants
an unreliable person associated
with him, especially if that per
son is in a position where a blem
ish on his reputation might ex
tend to his associates.
Would Mr. Tan accept such a
person into his business, even if
that person was Phi Beta Kappa
and had been elected "most pop
ular" in his class? Certainly I
don't believe that he would also
be "most respected," and it is
also hard to imagine him being
the "most popular." Then there
is always the question of how
he achieved the academic honors
which led to Phi Beta Kappa.

The committee would be com
posed of two members of the
People's Committee to Free Earl
Browder, two former members of
the Amerikadeutscher Volksbund,

an element of personal bias might
exist in such a committee, but an
Electoral University would un

some people, by worse people, and

better people, and for mothers

In his letter of 11-9-60 Mr. War
ner Tan asserts that, "When a
graduate looks for a job, the two
main things interviewers look at
are personality and grades." It
would seem that an individual's
integrity is of no importance, that
a person with good grades and
a pleasing smile will get the job.
I ask of Mr. Tan: what business
firm or which of the various pro
fessional groups would desire,
much less accept, a person of
doubtful integrity? But then may
be I am wrong, perhaps an Honor
Code violation casts no shadow
on an individual's integrity. Per
haps a person starts life after
college, with a clean slate, with
no hint of what he might do in
the future because the past
doesn't affect the future.
I deny the validity of the last
two conjectures. No one wants
an unreliable person associated
with him, especially if that per
son is in a position where a blem
ish on his reputation might ex
tend to his associates.
Would Mr. Tan accept such a
person into his business, even if
that person was Phi Beta Kappa
and had been elected "most pop
ular" in his class? Certainly I
don't believe that he would also
be "most respected," and it is
also hard to imagine him being
the "most popular." Then there
is always the question of how
he achieved the academic honors
which led to Phi Beta Kappa.

Now that the Messiah has been
duly chosen by his people, it is
apparently time for the editor of
the peninsula's only morning
newspaper to impugn the system
of choice. He has proposed the
direct ballot, a device susceptible
to rule by that desultory monster,
the Mob. In answer to his icono
clastic suggestions I submit that
only a small refinement of the
present electoral college is neces
sary.
My system, the Electoral Uni
versity, would consist of the pres
ent Electoral College supplement
ed by a committee of seven mem
bers which would assign to each
state a "maturity factor," a num
ber between zero and one by
which the electoral vote of that
state would be multiplied. For ex
ample, southern states might be
assigned the number one-half,
simply because people there have
not learned to vote properly.
Similarly California might receive
the number seven-eighths due to
the rampant idiocy extant
throughout the state.
