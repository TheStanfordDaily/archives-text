Editor, the Daily:
This letter is directed not only
to Mr. Tan but also to all other
students who are or will be seek
ing employment. I received from
Mr. William Lowe, Director of
the Placement Service, the results
of a study made by the Western
College Placement Association to
determine what qualities, and in
what order, employers look for
in the bachelor-level college grad
uate entering the labor market
for the first time. The results are:
1) INTEGRITY
2) Ability to think logically
3) Enthusiasm, initiative, drive
4) Dependability
5) Ability to communicate,
orally and in writing
6) Emotional stability
7) Ability to get along with
others
8) Evidence of good judgment
9) Ability to make decisions
10) Interest in career as opposed
to "job" or salary
11) Capacity for leadership
12) Willingness to contribute to
job development
13) Maturity
14) Adjustability
15) General interest in type of
work and kind of company
16) Bearing, poise, self-confidence
17) Good health
18) Good manners
19) Recognition of obligations to
community, family and em
ployer
20) Physical appearance
21) SCHOLASTIC STANDING
22) Sense of humor
23) Normal family life
24) Reasonable freedom from
limitations imposed by per
sona) and family restrictions
25) Extra-curricular activities
26) Military status
27) Marital status
Admittedly a few firms might
give the same criteria a different
priority ranking. It can be argued
further that Integrity is a hard
concept to measure in a half hour
interview. But one has to give the
interviewers some credit for their
experience in judging qualities.
Many times one's reputation pre
cedes him more than he realizes.
This latter point becomes more
important: year by year as people
who know you, either directly or
indirectly, are asked what they
know about you; you are never
asked to support or refute their
statements.
Every day we make value judg
ments about other people. How
ever, we forget that others are
making value judgments about
us. Our actions each day deter
mine what these judgments will
be.

Admittedly a few firms might
give the same criteria a different

further that Integrity is a hard
concept to measure in a half hour
interview. But one has to give the
interviewers some credit for their
experience in judging qualities.
Many times one's reputation pre
cedes him more than he realizes.
This latter point becomes more
important: year by year as people
who know you, either directly or
indirectly, are asked what they
know about you; you are never
asked to support or refute their
statements.
Every day we make value judg
ments about other people. How
ever, we forget that others are
making value judgments about
us. Our actions each day deter
mine what these judgments will
be.
