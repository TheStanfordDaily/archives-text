## 'I Move We Table... 
### 
If anyone is wandering around
i searching for a paradox, we can
suggest a prime example—Stan
ford's student legislature (LAS
SU).
Rarely has a student govern
ment body had such power and
opportunity to make itself felt in
campus affairs. And rarely has
an organization with such power
and influence and opportunity
consistently put on a more frus
trating display of refusing to
commit itself to anything, or
take advantage of the opportuni
ties which lie all around it.
What is puzzling about the
matter, to us anyway, is that the
members of LASSU which num
bers 28—as a group compose a
very talented, likeable bunch of
people. They have an interest in
campus affairs and most realize
that the Stanford student govern
ment is just about the most inde
pendent and powerful such body
in the nation.
Why, then, do so few of them
speak up in LASSU meetings ev
ery Thursday night? Why do
they seem unwilling to take a
stand on anything of importance?
Why do they constantly table mo
tions "until next week"?
Many members give the im
pression that they consider them
selves as mouthpieces for their
constituents and nothing more.
They say that they cannot do
anything without consulting the
students, because they don't want
to give the impression to the
world that they are speaking for
all Stanford students when they
pass a resolution.
Apparently, they feel it is not |
their responsibility to take the
initiative on such things as the
Peace Corps plan, which they ta
bled last week by a 15-8 vote un
til they could poll their constitu
ents.
The matter will come up again
this Thursday and should be

pass or] overwhelmingly. Tho
question is, why did the group
not act last Thursday when they
had the chanee, and okay a reso
lution which would have allowed
IIR and Political Union to go
ahead with a campus-wide pro
gram of education and explana
tion of the Poaco Corps plan?
The resolution would only have
had LASSU endorsing "in prin
ciple" the idea, and would have
allowed Ihe two student groups
to go ahead with the program.
But, cautious and wishy-washy
as ever, the group tabled the reso
lution until this week, so they
could "poll the constituents."
What is ironic is that very few
"constituents" will be asked for
their opinion on the matter.
Some members feel that they
cannot consider such "outside"
things as -sit-ins, the House Un-
American Activities Committee,
the Peace Corps and so forth.
Somehow, they believe that such
things are not within their prov
ince to comment on.
It seems to us that those things
SHOULD be commented on, and
particularly by students. It is in
teresting to note that other stu
dent government groups around
the country frequently make
their views known, while Stan
ford's student leaders consider
such things as tho Skindivers'
Club constitution, and when
something of importance does
arise, quickly dispose of it with
out action one way or tho other.
From past experience, it looks
as if LASSU will go on its merry
way talking about the normal,
mundane tilings and keep its
hands off anything which might
be controversial.
But it does get frustrating at
times. As one fed-up member
said last week to her fellow LAS
SU members, "Are you afraid to
take a stand on something?"

members of LASSU which num
bers 28—as a group compose a
very talented, likeable bunch of
people. They have an interest in
campus affairs and most realize
that the Stanford student govern
ment is just about the most inde
pendent and powerful such body
in the nation.
Why, then, do so few of them
speak up in LASSU meetings ev
ery Thursday night? Why do
they seem unwilling to take a
stand on anything of importance?
Why do they constantly table mo
tions "until next week"?
Many members give the im
pression that they consider them
selves as mouthpieces for their
constituents and nothing more.
They say that they cannot do
anything without consulting the
students, because they don't want
to give the impression to the
world that they are speaking for
all Stanford students when they
pass a resolution.
Apparently, they feel it is not |
their responsibility to take the
initiative on such things as the
Peace Corps plan, which they ta
bled last week by a 15-8 vote un
til they could poll their constitu
ents.
The matter will come up again
this Thursday and should be

pass or] overwhelmingly. Tho
question is, why did the group
not act last Thursday when they
had the chanee, and okay a reso
lution which would have allowed
IIR and Political Union to go
ahead with a campus-wide pro
gram of education and explana
tion of the Poaco Corps plan?
The resolution would only have
had LASSU endorsing "in prin
ciple" the idea, and would have
allowed Ihe two student groups
to go ahead with the program.
But, cautious and wishy-washy
as ever, the group tabled the reso
lution until this week, so they
could "poll the constituents."
What is ironic is that very few
"constituents" will be asked for
their opinion on the matter.
Some members feel that they
cannot consider such "outside"
things as -sit-ins, the House Un-
American Activities Committee,
the Peace Corps and so forth.
Somehow, they believe that such
things are not within their prov
ince to comment on.
It seems to us that those things
SHOULD be commented on, and
particularly by students. It is in
teresting to note that other stu
dent government groups around
the country frequently make
their views known, while Stan
ford's student leaders consider
such things as tho Skindivers'
Club constitution, and when
something of importance does
arise, quickly dispose of it with
out action one way or tho other.
From past experience, it looks
as if LASSU will go on its merry
way talking about the normal,
mundane tilings and keep its
hands off anything which might
be controversial.
But it does get frustrating at
times. As one fed-up member
said last week to her fellow LAS
SU members, "Are you afraid to
take a stand on something?"
If anyone is wandering around
i searching for a paradox, we can
suggest a prime example—Stan
ford's student legislature (LAS
SU).
Rarely has a student govern
ment body had such power and
opportunity to make itself felt in
campus affairs. And rarely has
an organization with such power
and influence and opportunity
consistently put on a more frus
trating display of refusing to
commit itself to anything, or
take advantage of the opportuni
ties which lie all around it.
What is puzzling about the
matter, to us anyway, is that the
members of LASSU which num
