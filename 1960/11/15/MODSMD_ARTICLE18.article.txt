# BIG MEET
## Card Runners Set For Upset Try 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
The first Stanford-Cal clash of Big Game Week will take place
this afternoon at 4 o'clock as the Card Harriers travel to Berkeley to
challenge the outstanding Bear runners.
Stanford will not be favored to win the Big Meet, largely on the
fact that the two teams have met three times already this year, and

Cal has won each time. But each
time the Indians have shown
promise of better things to come.
TIIE INDIAN cross country
squad is still quite young and in
experienced. Five of the nine
men at the starting line for Stan
ford will be freshmen, and the
rest of the team is equally di
vided between sophomores and
juniors. By contrast, most of ihe
Cal team has had several years
of varsity experience.
But the Farm distance men
have been developing fast. Frosh
Bill Pratt and Larry Shafer have
moved into the second and fourth
positions on the team.
The only Indian, however, with
any chance for individual victory
is junior Rich Klier. Klier's task
is a big one: to stay with and
perhaps pass Cal's Alan Gaylord.
GAVLORI) is some runner.
Just last Thursday he practically
ran away from Laszlo Tabori,
the Hungarian ex-Olympic star
whom some thought might have
beaten Herb Elliott had he been
eligible this year. Perhaps Tabori
was not at the very peak of con
dition. but anyone who can beat
him by 21 seconds at any time
has accomplished something.
Gaylord is 1 he sort who would
be called an "old pro," except that
Cal athletes are Simon-pure ama
teurs too.
But Klier is no slouch either.
Three times he has tagged along
light behind Gaylord, once fin
ishing as close as five seconds
behind.
Coach Payton Jordan considers
Klier the best half-mile prospect
Stanford has ever had, but it is
really quite ama/.ing that he has
been able to compete so well
against longer distance men over
the four-mile course.
CAL'S SECOND man also pre
sents problems for the Cards.
Woody Covington has beaten
both Pratt and John Northway,
who is almost exactly equal to
Pratt, in all three previous meet
ings. Covington's shadow, George
Linn, also belongs in the com
pany of these three.
Five men on each team must
score, and the real jockeying for
position will take place further
down the line. Juan Ochoa and J
Gordon Whitehead have shown I
vast improvement for the Bears,
displacing Karl Uebel and Des
mond O'Neill in the fourth and
fifth positions.
Trying to match Ihem will be 1
three Indian frosh, Shafer, Robin ;
Ruble, and Dave Boore. Both |
Ruble and Boore have had trouble |
running up to their potential j
level, but thev could pull a sur

prise. Frank Wallace, Bruce
Johnson, and Ral p h Weidner
round out the field.
COACH Jordan states that Ihe
team realizes its underdog role
but that "We can get Ihem. if we
run up to and perhaps a little
beyond our ability. If we don't,
we could be badly beaten. But
this is the kind of challenge this
team can rise to."
It's that little extra something
that counts in the Big Meet. The
pressure will be on both teams
as the pack pursues the fleet
Gaylord over the course.
