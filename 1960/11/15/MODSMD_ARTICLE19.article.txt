# Booters Maintain Hopes For Playoffs; Split Two
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford's hooters edged the Cal Aggies of Davis 3-1 Saturday to
remain in contention for a hid to attend the NCAA playoffs later
in November.
The decision of the West Coast Soccer Conference as to whether
Stanford or California will represent the league in the playoffs will

be made by the middle of this!
week. This means that the league
representative may not necessa
rily be the winner of the "Big
Soccer Game," since travel ar
rangements have to lie made sev- j
eral days in advance of the Sat-i
urday date set for travel 1o the j
site of the playoffs.
STANFORD'S victory was Ihe
Indians' sixth against two losses.
On Friday Stanford lost to the
University of British Columbia
10-3 in an unpleasant combina
tion of rain, wind and mud. The
only Stanford man to solve the
ÜBC defense was Emmanuel j
Andah, who scored all three Stan- i
ford scores.
The game Saturday was also
marked by rain, wind and mud. It
was evident from ihe start that i
the wind would be a deciding fac-!

tor in the game, since the 25-35
mile per hour gusts made it im
possible to kick a ball into the
wind for any distance.
A team on the offense kicking
with the wind could kick a hall
high and the wind would carry it
over half the length of the field.
In the first quarter, Stanford had
the wind at its back and took ad
vantage of it, keeping the Aggies
backed up against their own goal
with high passes down the center
of the field. With ten minutes
gone in the first period Andah
scored the first Stanford goal.
HK KKOKE behind the defense,
as ho usually does several times
a game, and went to the left. The
goalie went with his fake and
Andah swung back to the right
leaving the goalie writhing on
the ground with a twisted leg
trying to follow Andah. The Stan
ford center-forward then easily
put the ball into the goal for a
1-0 lead.
It took Cal only a minute and
a half to take advantage of hav
ing the wind at their backs in the
second quarter. That was Cal's
last gasp, but it left the score
tied 1-1 at the half.
FINALLY, with seven minutes
to go in the game, Stanford went
ahead 2-1 when Dick Bartlett
emerged with the ball from a
tangle of players in front of the
goal and scored.
The Aggies still had the wind
at their backs and seven minutes
in which to score, but the Stan
ford defense led by Dick Voake,
Ed Berner and Beau Bianchi
kept ihe Aggies from scoring.
The game was in doubt until
Stanford scored again on high
scoring halfback Bernie Knaggs'
free kick with 0:17 left in the
game. The Aggies' goalie had
touched the ball wjih his hands
outside the penalty area (in front
of the goal). The penally for that

is a free kick at the goal from
the point of the offense.
KNAGGS put the ball through

the group of Aggies who tried to
block his shot ai ihe goal's mouth
and clinched the victory.

The decision of the West Coast Soccer Conference as to whether
Stanford or California will represent the league in the playoffs will

be made by the middle of this!
week. This means that the league
representative may not necessa

STANFORD'S victory was Ihe
Indians' sixth against two losses.
On Friday Stanford lost to the
University of British Columbia
10-3 in an unpleasant combina
tion of rain, wind and mud. The
only Stanford man to solve the
ÜBC defense was Emmanuel j
Andah, who scored all three Stan- i
ford scores.
The game Saturday was also
marked by rain, wind and mud. It
was evident from ihe start that i
the wind would be a deciding fac-!

tor in the game, since the 25-35
mile per hour gusts made it im
possible to kick a ball into the
wind for any distance.
A team on the offense kicking
with the wind could kick a hall
high and the wind would carry it
over half the length of the field.
In the first quarter, Stanford had
the wind at its back and took ad
vantage of it, keeping the Aggies
backed up against their own goal
with high passes down the center
of the field. With ten minutes
gone in the first period Andah
scored the first Stanford goal.
HK KKOKE behind the defense,
as ho usually does several times
a game, and went to the left. The
goalie went with his fake and
Andah swung back to the right
leaving the goalie writhing on
the ground with a twisted leg
trying to follow Andah. The Stan
ford center-forward then easily
put the ball into the goal for a
1-0 lead.
It took Cal only a minute and
a half to take advantage of hav
ing the wind at their backs in the
second quarter. That was Cal's
last gasp, but it left the score
tied 1-1 at the half.
FINALLY, with seven minutes
to go in the game, Stanford went
ahead 2-1 when Dick Bartlett
emerged with the ball from a
tangle of players in front of the
goal and scored.
The Aggies still had the wind
at their backs and seven minutes
in which to score, but the Stan
ford defense led by Dick Voake,
Ed Berner and Beau Bianchi
kept ihe Aggies from scoring.
The game was in doubt until
Stanford scored again on high
scoring halfback Bernie Knaggs'
free kick with 0:17 left in the
game. The Aggies' goalie had
touched the ball wjih his hands
outside the penalty area (in front
of the goal). The penally for that

is a free kick at the goal from
the point of the offense.
KNAGGS put the ball through

the group of Aggies who tried to
block his shot ai ihe goal's mouth
and clinched the victory.
