# AF Snags Another Satellite
## 
### 
HONOLULU (UPII An Air
Force plane flown with pin-point
precision almost six miles above
the ocean yesterday caught the
gold-plated capsule of a Discov
erer .satellite that had whirled a
record 31 times and almost a mil
lion miles around the world.
It was only the second time in
history that a satellite capsule
has been caught in mid-air and
the air crew that did it almost
missed tho flight because of me
chanical trouble. They snagged it
on the second pass of their "Peli
can II" C-119 within sight of three
other planes.
THE Discoverer XVII with its
capsule, fired from Vandenberg
Air Force Base in California Sat
urday. was left in space for 31
passes around the earth instead
of the usual IT when scientists
reported it. working perfectly
while in polar orbit at 18,000 miles
an hour.
The parachuting capsule fell
directly into the 230 by 50 mile
recovery area after it was ejected
exactly on time on signal from
the ground. It was caught by the
nylon ropes trailed from steel
booms behind and below the
plane.
Pilot of the catch plane was
Capt. Gene Jones of New York
City and Walla Walla, Wash. lie
is operations officer of the special
recovery team and charged with
training the recovery crews.
HE FLEW over the parachut
ing capsule and snagged it north
west of the Hawaiian Islands in
the same manner as Capt. Harold
E. Mitchell who was one of the
men trained by Jones made the
historic first catch Aug. 19.
When the fliers arrived back at
Hickam Air Force Base they were
greeted by a cheering crowd and
by Lt. Gen. Emmett O'Donnell,
Pacific Air Force commander,
who praised them "not only for
your achievement but for proving
again that the U.S. Air Force has
the most outstanding outfield of j
any space age team."
