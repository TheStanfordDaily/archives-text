# LEADING CAL RUSHER STEVE BATES
## 
### 
A major problem for Stanford defenses Saturday will be
Cal right halfback Steve Bates. Apparently fully recovered
from his smashed face, suffered at the elbow of Mike Mc-
Keever, Bates has galloped for 316 yards in 69 plays, an
average of 4.7 yards per carry, to top the Bear ground game.
