## New Orleans Schools Integrated Peacefully 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (UPII Four 6-year-old Negro girls, escorted
by U.S. deputy marshals and protected by 140 city police, went to
formerly all-white public schools in New Orleans for the first time
yesterday.
No violence was reported. Crowds of more than 500 white per-

sons, many teen-aged, gathered
around the schools to jeer when
the Negroes appeared, but made
no move against them.
FOLK 10 said about 18 persons
were arrested in the vicinity of
the integrated schools "for minor
infractions." At least, a dozen of
those arrested were white high
school youths who caused disturb
ances.
The girls entered the schools
half an hour late and left half an
hour early. A wall of city police
faced a jeering crowd as three
girls left McDonogh 19, where
they attended a class with a few
white girls.
Thus the first day of integra
tion of Louisiana public schools
passed without undue difficulty
although
A federal judge had to coun
ter a legislative legal move with
a last-minute order which insured
the school board's authority to
conduct schools today.
About 7.~> state policemen
came to New Orleans under or
ders of the State Legislature,
which is almost solidly against in
tegral ion.
â€”lIUNDKKDS of white persons
gathered in front of Ihe two in
tegrated schools, waving Confed
erate flags, jeering and chanting
"two. four, six, eight we don't
wanna integrate."
The Legislature had ordered
a statew ide school holiday.
