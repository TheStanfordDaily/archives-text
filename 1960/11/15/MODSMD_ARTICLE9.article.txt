# Professors Foresee Kennedy Bottlenecks
## 
### KATHEE DOWNING 
With most of the votes counted, Kennedy is president-elect; only
a few die-hards express doubts as to the outcome of last Tuesday's
election.
Most Stanford political scientists now anticipate bottlenecks that
Kennedy will face for the next four years.
"Kennedy will have difficult sledding for his major legislative

program," feels Dr. Robert A.
Walker. "With the voting
strength of Southern Democrats
and conservatives, Republicans
have a majority in Congress."
Dr. G. H. Stuart agrees that
Ihe conservatives are numerous
enough to stop any radical legis
lation.
"HOWEVKR," Stuart warns,
"there is always a Congressional
honeymoon in the first months of
a new administration."
Both professors agree that Ken
nedy would have to do some
hard "pushing" to achieve his
program. "Because the White
House will be behind Congress,"
asserts Walker, "more will be ac
complished in the next term than
in Eisenhower's administration.
Then i Ike's term > Congress was
under constant threat of a presi
dental veto.
"The 'do-goodism' and New
Deal policies Kennedy proposes
will not be completely carried
out," Stuart feels. "After all. how
can taxes be reduced and the
budget be balanced simultane
ously?" he asks.
In appointing the next Secre
tary of State, Kennedy faces
major decisions. "Possible choices
could be Ambassador Bowles,
Governor Harriman, former Am
bassador David Bruce, or Senator
Fulbright." says Stuart.
OR. IvURT Steiner picks Ches
ter Bowles as possible Secretary
of State. "Bowles would appeal to
Asia; he could present the farm
policy," says Steiner.
Asked why Premier Khru
shchev sent his congratulatory
telegram to Kennedy, Steiner in
dicates that it was induced by
present tensions and that "it is
not indicative of favoritism for
one candidate or the other. The
Russians must view both Nixon
and Kennedy as capitalists," re
plied Steiner.
Another problem Kennedy
faces is elevating U.S. prestige in
Latin America. Steiner said, "Too
often we have not been identified
with the ouster of dictators in
these countries."
Steiner concluded. "The deci
sions Kennedy now faces must
deal with what is good for world
democracy, not just what is good
for us."

Another problem Kennedy
faces is elevating U.S. prestige in
Latin America. Steiner said, "Too
often we have not been identified
with the ouster of dictators in
these countries."
Steiner concluded. "The deci
sions Kennedy now faces must
deal with what is good for world
democracy, not just what is good
for us."
With most of the votes counted, Kennedy is president-elect; only
a few die-hards express doubts as to the outcome of last Tuesday's
election.
Most Stanford political scientists now anticipate bottlenecks that
Kennedy will face for the next four years.
"Kennedy will have difficult sledding for his major legislative

program," feels Dr. Robert A.
Walker. "With the voting
strength of Southern Democrats
and conservatives, Republicans
have a majority in Congress."
Dr. G. H. Stuart agrees that
Ihe conservatives are numerous
enough to stop any radical legis
lation.
"HOWEVKR," Stuart warns,
"there is always a Congressional
honeymoon in the first months of
a new administration."
Both professors agree that Ken
nedy would have to do some
hard "pushing" to achieve his
program. "Because the White
House will be behind Congress,"
asserts Walker, "more will be ac
complished in the next term than
in Eisenhower's administration.
Then i Ike's term > Congress was
under constant threat of a presi
dental veto.
"The 'do-goodism' and New
Deal policies Kennedy proposes
will not be completely carried
out," Stuart feels. "After all. how
can taxes be reduced and the
budget be balanced simultane
ously?" he asks.
In appointing the next Secre
tary of State, Kennedy faces
major decisions. "Possible choices
could be Ambassador Bowles,
Governor Harriman, former Am
bassador David Bruce, or Senator
Fulbright." says Stuart.
OR. IvURT Steiner picks Ches
ter Bowles as possible Secretary
of State. "Bowles would appeal to
Asia; he could present the farm
policy," says Steiner.
Asked why Premier Khru
shchev sent his congratulatory
telegram to Kennedy, Steiner in
dicates that it was induced by
present tensions and that "it is
not indicative of favoritism for
one candidate or the other. The
Russians must view both Nixon
and Kennedy as capitalists," re
plied Steiner.
