# Critic Silent On 'Abnormal' Chappie Issue
## 
### E.K. FARTHINGALE 
Normally I'm very hard on
the Chapparal. Normally the
Chappie deserves all the
nasty comments I make. The
first two Chappies this year
were abnormally poor and
my comments were corre
spondingly abnormally nasty.
However, today's Chappie
is funny. I consider it highly
unethical to ever compliment
that normally morose publi
cation, so I cannot write a re
view. However, I would like
to implore you to buy one as
soon as possible. And you'd
better keep it, too, because
you're not likely to read an
other Chappie quite so fun
-lovi n g, clever, witty and
CLEAN! (Oh, I hate myself!)
