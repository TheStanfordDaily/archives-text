# Students Act To Enforce Honor Code
## 
### 
At 11:00 yesterday morning a
group of 12 students took action
to uphold the Honor Code in Dr.
A. E. Sokol's Political Science 134
class.
The action of these undergradu
ate students consisted of simply
sitting in the classroom while the
midterm was being taken in order
to make sure that no cheating
took place.
THE STUDENTS' interest was
aroused by the fact that the first
midterm given to the class over
a week ago had to be discredited
because of the prevalent cheating
which occured during the test.
The midterm given yesterday was
to replace the earlier one.
The action being taken was
announced to the class before the
exam in a short speech by Fun
damental Standards Commission
Chairman Bob Linneman.
LINNEMAN, explaining why
these students felt their "sit-in"
action was necesary, stated, "On
the last exam in this class, not
only did students take advantage
of the Honor Code, but also other
students did not report these vio
lations." He told the class, "If
you want the Honor Code to stay,
you had better get off the dime
and support it. Otherwise you
may well be able to say that you
were the first class since 1921 to
have a proctored exam."
He emphasized the fact that the
students now sitting in on the
class were in no sense proctors,
but that they were interested stu
dents who had volunteered their
services because they felt that
some action was necesary to pre
serve the Honor Code.
