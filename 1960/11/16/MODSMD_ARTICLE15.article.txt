# India Committed to Ideals Of Democracyâ€”Spaeth

### JUDY SEABORG 
"There is no question about it;
the people and leaders, constitu
tion, and conduct of India ai'e
committed to what we in America
know as the democratic way," de
clared Carl B. Spaeth, Dean of
t he Stanford School of Law, last
night in a discussion of "India:
1950 to I960" in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
SPAETH, who returned earlier
this year from his third trip to
India within the last decade, dis
cussed the political and economic
problems and progress of India
and the role of the United States
in these concerns.
Speaking of India's economic
situation, Spaeth said, "We've got
to remember where they started."
He said they are trying to survive
in the 20th century by using 16th
century methods of communica
tion and agriculture. He describ
ed instances of poverty, but said
lie was "thrilled by the power de
velopment, irrigation, steel,
dams." and the contrast in
achievement from what it was
only a few years ago.
Spaeth said he was "concerned
about the population explosion
; and disgusted with those who say
: the U.S. shouldn't respond to re
! quests" for help with this prob
| lem.
FOUR of the major political
problems facing the country are
that "the elder statesmen of the
Congress party have failed to de
velop the new leadership needed
for the future; there is no oppos
ing party organized and qualified
enough to provide competition
and challenge to the Congress
party; there is a division of India
14 states and 12 major lan
guages pulling away from the
center; and young people getting

degrees with no promise of im
provement for themselves nor for
opportunity to be of service to
I their country."
THK ROLE of the U.S., Spaeth
! said, is to first make an assess
ment of the last decade to deter
mine the degree of progress and
the causes for concern in the fu
ture. The U.S. must channel more
of its assistance through the UN
and the International Bank as
well as "pressing our friends in
Western Europe for more partici
pation in this enterprise."
Finally, he approved strongly
jtii(> Peace Corps proposal, which
would "provide a goal and inspira
tion for many young Americans
as well as a challenge for the
youth o 1 India."
