# On the Brink

### 
Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who represents iho ex
treme right wing of the Republican party, recently proposed num
erous changes in U.S. foreign policv which, if enacted, would un
doubtedly lead the U.S. to llic brink of war (see story below).
Senator Goldwater's tactics are highly unrealistic since they fail
to recognize the existing power balance. His schemes are based on
the assumption that the U.S. is in a position to do anything it wishes
because it alone is a great power. His proposals also completely
ignore the right to self-determination, a concept on which this I
nation was founded. We demanded the right to build our nation
as we saw fit.
But apparently no other nation should have the right to deter
mine its own future, according to Goldwater. For instance, he sug
gests a Western "interim protectorate" over Africa which would
prepare the African people for self-government under "western
concepts of justice and freedom.*'
Is part of our concepts of justice and freedom based on un
wanted indoctrination, Senator Goldwater? How would the United
States as an emerging nation have felt if Britain, France or Ger
many set up "an interim protectorate"' to teach us "justice and
freedom"?
Concepts of justice and freedom cannot be forced upon people.
Most Africans cherish democratic ideals and in due time they will
institute them, but it shall take time. American democracy was
not built overnight nor was it built without a struggle.
African independence does not mean a return to savagery or
Communist domination as Senator Goldwater asserts. The "sleep
ing giant" has awakened and will not return to savagery. Africa
will not turn to the Communists either as long as we don't push
them into the Communist bloc by making America more repre
hensible than Russia or China.
Senator Goldwater's comments concerning Cuba also are unre
alistic- It is one thing to propose destruction of the Castro regime
and another to actually destroy it. A show of U.S. strength in Cuba
would inevitably lead to Russia's intervention on behalf of Cuba.
Neither Cuba nor anv other nation is worth starting World War
111 over. Man has fought man throughout history, and we should i
realize that war solves nothing.
No one denies Senator Goldwater the right to speak as he
pleases, but one should not sit idly by and allow him to assume
that war is the answer to our problems. Economic embargoes, naval
blockades, "interim protectorates," have all been tried in the past j
and have all failed to bring men closer to one another.
America's strength does not lie in her weapons or in her ability I
to bully smaller nations, but in her democratic institutions which
we must perpetuate and practice. Goldwaterites undoubtedly con
sider such an outlook as "idealistic poppycock," but if we don't
have idealism, then what do we have? i

that war is the answer to our problems. Economic embargoes, naval
blockades, "interim protectorates," have all been tried in the past j
and have all failed to bring men closer to one another.
America's strength does not lie in her weapons or in her ability I
to bully smaller nations, but in her democratic institutions which
we must perpetuate and practice. Goldwaterites undoubtedly con
sider such an outlook as "idealistic poppycock," but if we don't
have idealism, then what do we have? i
Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, who represents iho ex
treme right wing of the Republican party, recently proposed num
erous changes in U.S. foreign policv which, if enacted, would un
doubtedly lead the U.S. to llic brink of war (see story below).
Senator Goldwater's tactics are highly unrealistic since they fail
to recognize the existing power balance. His schemes are based on
the assumption that the U.S. is in a position to do anything it wishes
because it alone is a great power. His proposals also completely
ignore the right to self-determination, a concept on which this I
nation was founded. We demanded the right to build our nation
as we saw fit.
But apparently no other nation should have the right to deter
mine its own future, according to Goldwater. For instance, he sug
gests a Western "interim protectorate" over Africa which would
prepare the African people for self-government under "western
concepts of justice and freedom.*'
Is part of our concepts of justice and freedom based on un
wanted indoctrination, Senator Goldwater? How would the United
States as an emerging nation have felt if Britain, France or Ger
many set up "an interim protectorate"' to teach us "justice and
freedom"?
Concepts of justice and freedom cannot be forced upon people.
Most Africans cherish democratic ideals and in due time they will
institute them, but it shall take time. American democracy was
not built overnight nor was it built without a struggle.
African independence does not mean a return to savagery or
Communist domination as Senator Goldwater asserts. The "sleep
ing giant" has awakened and will not return to savagery. Africa
will not turn to the Communists either as long as we don't push
them into the Communist bloc by making America more repre
hensible than Russia or China.
Senator Goldwater's comments concerning Cuba also are unre
alistic- It is one thing to propose destruction of the Castro regime
and another to actually destroy it. A show of U.S. strength in Cuba
would inevitably lead to Russia's intervention on behalf of Cuba.
Neither Cuba nor anv other nation is worth starting World War
111 over. Man has fought man throughout history, and we should i
realize that war solves nothing.
No one denies Senator Goldwater the right to speak as he
pleases, but one should not sit idly by and allow him to assume
that war is the answer to our problems. Economic embargoes, naval
blockades, "interim protectorates," have all been tried in the past j
