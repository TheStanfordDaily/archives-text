# Goldwater Proposal
## 
### UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry
Goldwater Monday proposed a
series of drastic changes in U.S.
foreign policy—including less re
liance on the United Nations and
the active promotion of U.S.-
backed revolutions in Communist
Eastern Europe.
The Arizona Senator, a leader
in the GOP's Conservative bloc,
also suggested that the Western
powers consider an "interim pro
tectorate" over Africa to prepare
that strife-torn area for effective
self-government.
Goldwater speaks out on foreign
poliey issues only infrequently by
normal Senate standards ami his
remarks could signal a major try
on his part to win a stronger
voice in GOP councils in anticipa
tion of the HUM presidential race.
Goldwater said after Vice Presi
dent Richard M. Nixon's defeat
that he wanted a voice in the
next national election battle.
He said he was not necessarily
shooting for the presidency him
self, "hut I don't want (New York
Gov. Nelson A.) Rockefeller in
that spot."
Goldwater aired his views in an
address before the Air War Col
lege at Maxwell Air Force Base,
Montgomery, Ala. He said the
United States "must shed the at
titudes and techniques of the
Salvation Army and start be
having like a great power."
Otherwise, he said, "the situa
tion will progressively worsen
until the United States is at bay—
isolated and beseiged by an en
tirely hostile world."
Goldwater proposed that the
United States take the "offen
sive" in world affairs by:
—"Making it clear in the most
explicit terms that Communist
governments are not tolerated in
this hemisphere and that the Cas
tro regime, being such a govern
ment, will be eliminated."
— Applying "the full weight of
American diplomacy" to main

tain and restore Western influ
ence in Africa with perhaps an
"interim protectorate" adminis
tered by the Western nations.
—Actively promoting' the "cap
tive peoples" of Eastern Europe
to revolt against their Commu
nist governments and have a U.S.
nuclear armed (ask force ready
to assist them under an ultima
tum against Russian interven
tion.
—Junking the idea of disarma
ment "because we need our arma
ments."
—Not taking the United Na
tions "seriously." Goldwater said
"continued American deference
to the United Nations will invite
the direst consequences."
Goldwater said support for his
get-tough policy toward Cuba
could be sought from Latin Amer
ican nations "by whatever dis
creet reminders are necessary of
America's importance to their
economic and political well
being."
"We would then proceed with
the relevant economic embargo
against Cuba, supported —if nec
essary—by a naval blockade," he
said.
Goldwater said the Unit e d
States could "anticipate riots in
the streets of Rio, Caracas and
Mexico City which we would ig
nore."
He said a Western "interim
protectorate" over Africa would
preside over a crash program pre
paring the African people for
self-government under "Western
concepts of justice and freedom."
"I ndepe n d en c e," he said,
"means a return to savagery or
Communist domination."
"The colonial system, even in
its present stage of development,"
Goldwater said, "is better for the
African people than the misery
and chaos into which they are
now plunging headlong."

WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry
Goldwater Monday proposed a
series of drastic changes in U.S.
foreign policy—including less re
liance on the United Nations and
the active promotion of U.S.-
backed revolutions in Communist
Eastern Europe.
The Arizona Senator, a leader
in the GOP's Conservative bloc,
also suggested that the Western
powers consider an "interim pro
tectorate" over Africa to prepare
that strife-torn area for effective
self-government.
Goldwater speaks out on foreign
poliey issues only infrequently by
normal Senate standards ami his
remarks could signal a major try
on his part to win a stronger
voice in GOP councils in anticipa
tion of the HUM presidential race.
Goldwater said after Vice Presi
dent Richard M. Nixon's defeat
that he wanted a voice in the
next national election battle.
He said he was not necessarily
shooting for the presidency him
self, "hut I don't want (New York
Gov. Nelson A.) Rockefeller in
that spot."
Goldwater aired his views in an
address before the Air War Col
lege at Maxwell Air Force Base,
Montgomery, Ala. He said the
United States "must shed the at
titudes and techniques of the
Salvation Army and start be
having like a great power."
Otherwise, he said, "the situa
tion will progressively worsen
until the United States is at bay—
isolated and beseiged by an en
tirely hostile world."
Goldwater proposed that the
United States take the "offen
sive" in world affairs by:
—"Making it clear in the most
explicit terms that Communist
governments are not tolerated in
this hemisphere and that the Cas
tro regime, being such a govern
ment, will be eliminated."
— Applying "the full weight of
American diplomacy" to main

tain and restore Western influ
ence in Africa with perhaps an
"interim protectorate" adminis
tered by the Western nations.
—Actively promoting' the "cap
tive peoples" of Eastern Europe
to revolt against their Commu
nist governments and have a U.S.
nuclear armed (ask force ready
to assist them under an ultima
tum against Russian interven
tion.
—Junking the idea of disarma
ment "because we need our arma
ments."
—Not taking the United Na
tions "seriously." Goldwater said
"continued American deference
to the United Nations will invite
the direst consequences."
Goldwater said support for his
get-tough policy toward Cuba
could be sought from Latin Amer
ican nations "by whatever dis
creet reminders are necessary of
America's importance to their
economic and political well
being."
"We would then proceed with
the relevant economic embargo
against Cuba, supported —if nec
essary—by a naval blockade," he
said.
Goldwater said the Unit e d
States could "anticipate riots in

—Junking the idea of disarma

—Not taking the United Na

"continued American deference
to the United Nations will invite
the direst consequences."
Goldwater said support for his
get-tough policy toward Cuba
could be sought from Latin Amer
ican nations "by whatever dis
creet reminders are necessary of
America's importance to their
economic and political well
being."
"We would then proceed with
the relevant economic embargo
against Cuba, supported —if nec
essary—by a naval blockade," he
said.
Goldwater said the Unit e d
States could "anticipate riots in
the streets of Rio, Caracas and
Mexico City which we would ig
nore."
He said a Western "interim
protectorate" over Africa would
preside over a crash program pre
paring the African people for
self-government under "Western
concepts of justice and freedom."
"I ndepe n d en c e," he said,
"means a return to savagery or
Communist domination."
"The colonial system, even in
its present stage of development,"
Goldwater said, "is better for the
African people than the misery
and chaos into which they are
now plunging headlong."
