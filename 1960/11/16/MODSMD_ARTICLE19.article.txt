## The
						End of Honor Code? 
### 
Yesterday I had the misfortune
of taking my first examination at
Stanford with proctors in the
room.
Although the members of the
Fundamental Standard Commis
sion who administered the test
did not consider themselves proc
tors, their presence served that
purpose and was to have the
same effect—the prevention of
cheating.
The need for this experiment
was created after a recent mid
term in the class when several
people were observed cheating;
and were reported to the Dean's
office; however, the students re
porting' the violation of the Honor
Code refused to point out the
guilty class members. As a result
the midterms were confiscated
by the Dean, and another mid
term was given yesterday under
strict supervision.
The Honor Code has been in
effect at Stanford for almost
forty years and during that time
has received the approval of
most of the students attending
Stanford, particularly those who
have seen proctor systems in ef
fect at other universities. The as
sumption behind the Honor Code
has been that most students have
enough self-respect to refrain
from cheating if they have signed
an oath to do so, and as a result
cer tain privileges such as leaving
the room during an exam and
being without proctors have been
extended.
Of course, it was obvious that
the Honor Code could not be 100
per cent effective; and therefore,
a system of detection, reporting,
and punishment had to bo de
vised for the few deviators. One
of the main factors now endan
gering the existence of the Honor
Code revolves around ignorance
of this system.
The procedure is that when one
student sees another cheating in
class during an exam he is to
tap his pencil on his desk until
the other person stops. If the
cheating continues, the observing
student is to go to the cheating
student after class, inform him
of what he saw, and tell him he
will report the violation if the
cheating student does not turn
himself in. Only if the latter re
fuses to do this is the other stu
dent to report the violation.
The difficulty arises when stu
dents who see cheating - do not
want to turn in people they know
but feel obligated to report the
violation either because of the
effect on their own grade or be
cause of some inner moral sua
sion. Since no student can be pin

pointed as cheating, the whole
class must suffer. The conse
quences in the particular class
mentioned earlier were not dras
tic, as time remained to give an
other midterm. Had the same sit
uation occurred on a final, the
results might have been disas
trous.
Any student observing a vio
lation of the Honor Code should
choose between one of two
courses. He either should ignore
the cheating if his conscience so
dictates or he should follow the
procedure described earlier in re
porting the violation. To tell
merely Ihat cheating occurred
harms the Honor Code system
and may eventually lead to its
abolishment.
Problems concerning the Honor
Code are not new at Stanford;
however, they have grown more
numerous and severe in the past
ten years. There are several rea
sons for this increase, one of the
most often cited being the added
pressure and competition in re
cent years. This excuse, if legiti
mate, seems to me to portend a
rather grim future for the Honor
Code, -since the scramble for
grades is certainly not going to
get less tedious.
The responsibility for abuse of
the Honor Code system, as I see
it", lies in three areas. The first of
these is lack of proper orienta
tion in past years by pre-reg com
mittees and the Fundamental
Standard Commission. Many stu
dents spend four years at Stan
ford without really knowing the
purpose and methods of the
Honor Code system, merely be
cause they were too lazy to find
out for themselves and there was
nobody waving the facts in front
of them. This year a diligent ef
fort is being made by the Funda
mental Standard Commission to
impress the meaning of the
Honor Code on the freshmen in
hopes that the system can be re
vived and strengthened.
The second area of responsi
bility lies with the student body,
p articular! y within certain
groups. The number of convic
tions tor men in the last ten years
has far outdistanced that of
women, and among the men, the
fraternities with one-third of the
male undergraduate population
are responsible for 78 per cent of
the convictions. Perhaps a cer
tain amount of self-discipline
within these groups is necessary;
in any case, they should certainly
take a look at the causes and pos
sible results of their actions.
And, thirdly, some segments of
the faeultv must bear responsi

bility. There have been cases
within entire departments when
fac u 11 y members, discovering
cheating, have given the guilty
students F's and not reported the
violations to Judicial Council.
Unless, as the many signs posted
in classrooms proclaim, coopera
tion exists between the faculty
and students, the spirit of the
Honor Code breaks down and the
system disintegrates.
If the Honor Code is to con
tinue at Stanford, and that is
far from a certainty, each stu
dent must realize and carry out
his own role in the system, and
the faculty must cooperate. The
only alternative is a return to
proctored tests and the restrictive
methods which accompany them,
and as many members in yester
day's midterm will testify, the
avoidance of that system is well
worth the effort to save Hie
Honor Code.
