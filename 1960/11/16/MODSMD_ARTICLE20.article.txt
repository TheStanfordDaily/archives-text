Kilitor, the Daily:
Apropos the recent revival of
discussion of Third Person Re
sponsibility, perhaps the opinion
of Our Founder will be of inter
est. The advice hero is from Le
land Stanford to his younger
brother, Thomas Welton Stan
ford:
If you are correct in your de
portment perhaps the Proffs. will

sometimes come to you to find
out who are the guilty ones in
the scrapes. Do not he an in
former. You are not at school for
that purpose, and are not obliged
morally to incur the ill will of
your fellows. When you know of
these and are asked about them,
tell the professors candidly you
cannot inform.
