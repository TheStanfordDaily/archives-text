Two Old Faces
Saturday is, of course, Big Game and for once the Farm has an
even chance of winning.
This will he the last football for Stanford until next fall. The
Big Game will be the last lime that many of the Stanford gridders
will be in action, and although the Indians have been known for the
past three years as primarily a passing team, two of the graduating
seniors who will be missed most are halfback Gil Dowd and fullback
Skip Face.
DOWI) AND FACE certainly haven't been unsung stars during
their varsity careers, but few people fully realize just how much

they contribute to Stanford's of
fense and the injuries both have
had to overcome.
Together the two lead the In
dians in rushing and scoring and,
next to Charlie Mitchell and Ray
Jackson of the Washington
Huskies, form the most danger
ous running twosome in the
AAWU.
Every week the po s t ga m e
stories invariably list Face and
Dowd as the two leading ground
gainers, and invariably some
where farther down in the col
umn there's another sentence or
two ". . . and Saturday's game
was the first time Dowd or Face
had been running at full speed
since being injured in last week's
action."
PERHAPS tho constant refer
ence to fine performances in spite
of injuries seems to the readers

to be nothing more than a well-worn sportswriting cliche. The truth
is that both Dowd and Face have turned in uncommon performances
despite odds that would stop most gridders before they got on the
practice field.
Face, a 6-0, 181-pound economics major from San Marino was
plagued with a bad back for the past two seasons. Doctors advised
him against going out for football at all but Skip had other plans;
he spent many hours working on hurdling, and gradually the track
exercise strengthened his back until ho was strong enough to nail
down a starting berth during his junior and senior years. Monday
he was named Northern California Back of the Year by the area
football writers.
Picking up from his back troubles with amazing speed, Face
scored 11 touchdowns and 31 points on kicks and extra point runs
for an even 100 counters and a tie for second highest scorer in the
nation in the 1959 campaign.
The senior backfield star also accomplished such feats as load
ing the Indians in rushing plays and total yards gained. And it
was Face's field goal from the Cal 25-yard line that almost gave the
Cards a win in last year's Big Game.
SO FAR THIS season Skip has shown a remarkable versatility.
The shifty fullback leads the locals in scoring, kickoffs, kickoff re
turns, punt returns, pass receiving and average gain per run.and
is second in punting and rushing. Those who attended the Oregon
State game saw a typical example of the Skip Face style of play.
Against the Beavers Face caught two touchdown passes, one good
for 56 yards, and kicked three extra points. Then late in the fourth
quarter he scored again, only to have a penalty nullify the effort.
Even more remarkable is the fact that's right that Face has
accomplished this despite suffering broken ribs and missing an en
tire week of practice early in the year.
(ill- DOWD is more of the same.
The 6-1, 205-pound senior from San Francisco has come back
after a so-so year as a junior and thus far has lead the Indians in
total yards gained on the ground. Dowd has marked up -110 yards
and has been a real workhorse, earring the ball 101 times to lead the
leam in that respect. Gil also is right up there in scoring with 30
points, second only to Face.
Hurt the Beavers
. Against the OSC Beavers Dowd was called on 20 times, almost
as many times as the rest of the Card runners put together. He re
sponded with 96 yards, including a four-yard end sweep for Stan
ford's second touchdown,
IT'S THE SAME story for Dowd. He's been running and fight
ing to recover from the bruises of the last game. Prior to the UCLA
game Gil was listed as a doubtful started because of an injured
knee. By game time, though, he was back in uniform and turned in
a creditable performance against the Bruins, leading the Cards in
average yards-per-carry.
That sort of play provides substance to an otherwise thin Stan
ford backfield.
Together Face and Dowd have scored almost two-thirds of Stan
ford's points in the nine games played this fall. Both are among the
top live scorers in the Big Five and both are listed among the total
offense leaders.
SATURDAY IS THE last time either will be listed in the Farm
lineup. They've been valuable assets to Cactus Jack and they're two
good reasons why Stanford might beat Cal.


CIL DOWD
Cal is last foe
