# Gold, Bates Lead Bears In Big Game
## 
### 
Sophomore quarterback Randy
Gold and senior halfback Steve
Bates will lead California's Gold
en Bears against Stanford in the
Big Game in Cal's Memorial Sta
dium Saturday.
Gold is Cal's major passing
threat and is second in Big Five
passing statistics only to Stan
ford's Dick IV or m a n. Handy
Randy has tried 116 aerials and
connected on 64 of them for 692
yards. Norman has hit on 84 of
180 tries for 924 yards.
Bates is currently sixth in con
ference rushing stats with 316
yards. He is just behind the In
dians' Gil Dowd and Skip Face.
Anchoring Cal's line will be
center-linebacker Dick Carlson
who Monday was named North
ern California lineman of the year
by the Bay Area football writers.
Other mainstays of the Cal
squad are fullbacks Walt Arnold
and George Pierovich, end Gael
Barsotti and tackle Jeff Snow.
Cal coach Marv Levy, who is
experiencing a rough go in this,
his first year at Cal. has some of
the bitter mixed with the better
in preparations for the Tribe.
Levy reported that Gold was
off form in the Bears' 28-7 loss
to Washington last week because
he was under the weather. Levy
said that tho soph signal caller
had a 102-degree temperature
after the game, but should be in
better shape for the big one.
Levy said he expects to play
reserve quarterback Larry Balliet
more than he has up to now.
The Bears have been blessed
with no new injuries and, like
the Indians, should go into tho
contest at full strength.
Levy said that "Stanford prob
ably creates more problems in
trying to defense a team than
we have had all year."
However, things look somewhat
better than that for Cal as they
have the best pass defense record
in the Big Five. They have held
opponents to a miserly 104 yards
per game.

better than that for Cal as they
have the best pass defense record
in the Big Five. They have held
opponents to a miserly 104 yards
per game.
Sophomore quarterback Randy
Gold and senior halfback Steve
Bates will lead California's Gold
en Bears against Stanford in the

connected on 64 of them for 692
yards. Norman has hit on 84 of
180 tries for 924 yards.
Bates is currently sixth in con
ference rushing stats with 316

experiencing a rough go in this,
his first year at Cal. has some of
the bitter mixed with the better
in preparations for the Tribe.
Levy reported that Gold was
off form in the Bears' 28-7 loss
to Washington last week because
he was under the weather. Levy
said that tho soph signal caller
had a 102-degree temperature
after the game, but should be in
better shape for the big one.
Levy said he expects to play
reserve quarterback Larry Balliet
more than he has up to now.
The Bears have been blessed
with no new injuries and, like
the Indians, should go into tho
contest at full strength.
Levy said that "Stanford prob
ably creates more problems in
trying to defense a team than
we have had all year."
