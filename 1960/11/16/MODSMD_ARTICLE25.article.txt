## Harriers Outrun Cal! 
### 
Stanford's harriers set the tone for Big Game Week yesterday
afternoon as Ihe cross country men outran a highly favored Cal
squad to win, 24 to 31. •
KICH KLUCR, the team's newly elected captain, lod the pack
around the 4.2 mile grass course in 21 minutes and *ix seconds, the

eighth fastest time ever run over j
the course. Little John Northway
was right behind in 21:15.
The victory was clouded slight
ly by the fact that Alan Gaylord,
Cal's outstanding number one :
man, became sick after two and
one-half miles and had to drop
out. But the way the Stanford
runners were moving along, it is
doubtful whether Gaylord could
have done anything but make the
score closer.
A CiKEAT team effort, coupled
with the performance of 1 he j
•stars, was the key to the win. All
of the top seven Indians ran their
fastest ever times over the dis
tance, and five of them improved
by almost a minute each.
Bill Pratt finished the race in
fourth place right on the heels
of George Linn, the first Bear to
cross the line. Woody Covington,
normally Cal's second runner,
was far back in sixth place, just
ahead of Larry Shafer.
ROBIN RUBLE was the fifth
Card to score, in tenth place,
while Frank Wallace, Bruce John
son, and Dave Boore were 11th,

14th, and 15th respectively.
Coach Payton Jordan was "ter
ribly proud of the wonderful
team effort" which produced the
solid victory. "This proves that
our boys can take a licking and
not give up." continued Jordan, re
ferring to tin 1 fact that Cal had
won in three previous meetings
of the teams. "They came back
and fought and had it when it
counted," added the coach.
SPIRIT was sky-high among
the entire track squad, with the
non-runners cheering loudly for
the harriers. Without a single
senior on the entire cross country
team, the potential of this group
is practically unlimited.
Now that the Card harriers
have conquered all of their con
ference foes at least once, they
will be out to whip the tough field
of thirteen teams in the West
Coast Cross Country Champion
ships next week at Stanford.
They will only get one shot at
this opposition, but on the basis
of past improvement, anything
can happen.
