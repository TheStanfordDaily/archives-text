# Forms Available For Africa Study
## 
### 
Applications for the Student
Exchange Program to Africa next
year are now available at the lIR
Shack and the ASSU office.
The program is open to under
graduates with preference given
to those who will return to Stan
ford for at least one quarter after
the year in Africa. Participating
students will receive credit for the
year's study abroad.
THE GRADUATE Division Re
search Office will assist the Stan
ford-African project in obtaining
fellowships and travel grants for
its exchange students according
to James P. Thurber, Jr., Assist
ant to the Dean of the Graduate
Division.
Thurber stated that one of the
key factors in fellowship support
of this type is an indication of
student interest, as many grant
ing organizations are leery of
supporting student - organized
projects when only a few people
are involved.
HE SAID that it is possible that
indirect financial assistance such
as tuition waivers or free room
and board will be forthcoming
from African institutions if the
program is successful.
