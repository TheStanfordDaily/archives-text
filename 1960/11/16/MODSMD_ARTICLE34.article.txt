# WUS Speaker Explains Drive

### 
"Children pay for the privilege
of being given an elementary edu
cation in one-room shacks" in Si
erra Leone, Africa, said Fred Sav
age, a native of that country at a
World University Service meeting
yesterday at Branner Hall.
VERY FEW texts are available
explained Savage, a Stanford po
litical science major. "My gov
ernment is trying to help, but at
present cannot afford much aid
to the schools," he said. He spoke
from personal experience on edu
cational problems in Sierra Leone,
and told what World University
Service, an international student
aid organization, can do to help.
"WUS has done a great deal
to help the situation in the short
time it has been working in Sierra
Leone," he said, "ft has persuaded
older people to attend evening
classes, and to pass on what they
learn to their families. WUS mon
etary contributions buy needed
books, classroom equipment and
provide necessary school build
ings," Savage emphasized.
THE AFRICAN student related
his own experiences which point
up one of the problems African

education presents. "My biggest
problem," he said, "was with the
foreign images created by Euro
pean textbooks. We had a math
problem in which we had to find
how long it would take to fill a
bathtub at a given rate of water
flow. This was difficult for us as
we had never seen a bathtub."
"WUS is just beginning in Si
erra Leone," Savage concluded,
"but its influence has done a great
deal already." The WUS drive at
Stanford will begin in living
groups and on Quad after Thanks
giving.
