# Rally Com Calm; Big Game Win Seen as 'Easy'
## 
### SONYA MICHEL 
A 1 Chambers rambled into the
Daily shack and perched himself
on the corner of a desk. As the
head of Rally Com, he seemed
extremely well-composed at the
outset of Big Game Week.
REACHING for a cigaret, he
said. "There's no doubt about it—
the spirit right now is better than
it ever has been. The freshmen
have more spirit than the upper
classmen. They're really an amaz
ing class.
"We're going to have the fresh
man rally Thursday night and the
rally Friday night, and card
stunts at the game. The theme
of the stunts is Stanford vs. Cal
— sayings like 'our tower is
larger than yours,' and lots of
things showing how we're better
than they are."
"I THINK Cal got a big kick
out of the Pisa incident. Hope
fully, the Eiffel Tower will look
like Ihc Leaning Tower of Pisa.
And there will be banners other
places," ho declared.
"I'll bo really happy to see the
Axe come back my senior year
when wo win the game," he said
assuredly, as ho swung a dun
gareed leg off the desk, and
sauntered out of the office.
It's very reassuring to know
it's going to be so easy to Beat
Cal.
