# The 						Stanford Axe, 31 Years of Tradition
## 
### JUDY SEABORG 
To 21 Stanford alumni a small gold key in the form of an axe
means more than any Phi Beta Kappa key. These men are the Im
mortal 21, the famed group who were responsible for one of the most
colorful and exciting legends in Stanford history, the return of the
Stanford Axe, which had been at Cal for 31 years.
On April 1.1, IS!)!), only two days after it had been born, the Axe
was stolen by more than 30 Cal men following a losing game for
Stanford at which the Axe had been introduced.
The three guardians of the Axe were the last to leave the park.
They were .jumped by the Cal men and the Axe was passed to the
star member of the Cal track team who speed away with his prize,
escaping finally in a delivery wagon. At the ferry to Berkeley, he
luckily spied a girlfriend and boarded the ferry, escaping detection
by searching police.
A "delegation" of Stanford men stormed the Chi Psi Fraternity,
home of the Cal baseball captain, where the Axe was hidden, but
failed to find it.
For 31 years Stanford was destined to be without its Axe. Al
though Stanford beat Cal in many athletic events, Cal had the
pleasure of seeing Stanfordites bristle to the retort. "We've still
got the Axe."
And then came April 3, 1930.
Not after three years of planning, as the legend goes, but after
one organizational meeting, three cars met at the Mausoleum and
headed for the Axe Rally in Cal's Greek Theater, razzing policemen
on the way. This occasion, held the day preceding the Cal-Stanford
baseball game, was the only time each year that the Stanford Axe
was taken out of its Berkeley vault.
Most of the twenty-one were upperclassmen living in Sequoia
Hall. The rest were grad students. The only precaution they took
was to replace the Stanford sticker on one of the cars with a Cal
sticker.
The group had what appeared to be a camera, in reality loaded
with a homemade tear-gas bomb, and a container of flash-powder.
They had tickets to the rally, but got in by helping push in the

armored car containing the Axe. Ai the rally, the plot was almost
foiled by Matt Lehmann, who handed a matchbook with a big red
"S" on it to a Cal student, and Howard Avery, who ignited a broom
handle and was waving it high in the air while the Californians
were religiously singing their hymn.
Five Stanford men left the rally 10 minutes early and drove to
the bank, where they backed the car onto the sidewalk and rigged
up the camera in the rumble seat. When the armored car returned
to the bank to deliver its valuable cargo and Norm llorner of Cal
stepped out holding the Axe tightly, the Stanford "photographers"
yelled, "Smile!"
The freshmen guards, pleased at the prospect at havng their
pictures in the paper, drew back eagerly. The overloaded shot of
flash-powder was discharged with a blinding flash just as Horner
stepped from the car. Howard Avery dropped from the top of the car
upon the unsuspectng custodian, wrenched the Axe from him, and
passed the implement fire-brigade fashion back to Robert Loof
bourow, who tucked the blade beneath his sweater and calmly
walked to the car.
As the car sped away, the men dropped a tear gas bomb to dis
courage pursuit, as well as leaving several Stanford men to con
fuse any organized attempt to follow.
Once back on campus, they were heralded with a jubilee rally
at which the Immortal 21 were introduced and Acting President
Robert E. Swain and other notables spoke. Donald Evans, '22 ex
student body president, stated, "They have won the gratitude of
every Stanford alumnus from the White House to San Quentin."
The 21 received varsity letters and keys in the form of axes, and
were wined, dined, and praised by everyone.
The Axe is now a trophy which has been gained and lost through
the years by Stanford, but the story of its return, as Lehmann com
mented, "is completely fantastic; it could only happen once."
