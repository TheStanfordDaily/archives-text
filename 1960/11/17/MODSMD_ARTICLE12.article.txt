# Battle of Symbols

### 
Stanford students have never been closer to losing the Honor
Code than they are at this moment. The situation has now deterio
rated to the point where special students have to sit in a classroom
during a test to make sure no one is cheating.
Twelve students sat in Dr. A. E. Sokol's Political Science 131
class Tuesday morning watching students taking a midterm.
Dr. Sokol's class, however, is not the only problem. During
the last ten years cheating lias increased at an alarming rate and
has finally caused the Fundamental Standard Commission to im
pose some restrictive, semi-punitive measures much against their
will.
Many reasons have been offered to explain why I lie Honor Code
is no longer accepted by many students. Some feel that the stu
dents are no longer as ethical as their predecessors who formu
lated the Code. Others feel that the Honor Code is simply not
understood by most of the students. Both of these points are
feasible but at best are parts of a much more complex whole.
The most important reason for the increase in Honor Code
violations, in our estimation, is the unnecessary importance placed
on attaining good grades rather than a good education.
Stanford students, like students at most universities in this
country, place little value upon knowledge and optimum value
upon A's and B's which ofttimes signify nothing in relation to how
much education a student has acquired.
Students here are immersed in a battle of grades. Many will
resort to devious means to assure them of a better grade than their
classmates. It strikes us that if students were concerned with
knowledge rather than symbols, cheating would be a thing of the
past.
Cutthroat competition is not necessary when every student is
not interested "in beating out" every other student, but is more
concerned with improving his mind. A grading system is neces
sary since some criterion must exist to allow faculty members to
tell students how they are faring vis-a-vis how they should be
faring. But grades should not be the strongest motivation to work.
Grade-conscious students are only partially to blame. Graduate
schools place greater value on grades than they do on education
and it must be kept in mind that there is a difference between
good grades and a good education.
The pressure on undergraduates could be considerably lessened
if graduate schools would devise methods of acceptance based on
something other than grades. For instance, graduate schools could
create a batter) - of tests to be given to prospective students which
would test their intellectual mettle and capacity. Grades fail to
perform this service since many students have enough natural
ability to get A's or B\s without "cracking the textbook."'
Of course, students who resort to such a method are cheating
only themselves. The same may be said for those who take advan
tage of the Honor Code. How much actual satisfaction accrues
from earning an A on a test or in a class if it is arrived at by
cheating or by not opening the textbook?
If the answer is a great deal of satisfaction, then the Honor
Code is doomed. If grades are more important then knowledge,
then the Honor Code is doomed. \\ e suspect, however, that very
few people can actually claim to get satisfaction from an A or B
"earned" by cheating. But judging from the increase in Honor
Code violations, we might be wrong.
