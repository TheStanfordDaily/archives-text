Along with our established
overseas programs, the African
Project is an evidence of Stan
ford's increasing interest in In
ternationa] Affairs and in crea
tive approaches to independent
study. This project is also an
other in a series of important and
stimulating activities sponsored
by the Institute of International
Relations in the last dozen years.
These activities have included the
original Model United Nations
Assembly on the Pacific Coast,
Foreign Policy Institutes, High
School UNESCO Conferences,
Student Exchanges, Affiliations
with the Student Bodies of the
Free University of Berlin, Keio
University and Moscow Univer
sity, as well as several others.
In many respects, the African
Project is the most ambitious and
imaginative of these activities to
date. The African Desk has shown
commendable resourcefulness and
creativeness in the marshalling of
local resources for African
studies. Plans which are being
developed are comprehensive.
They involve serious study of
Africa by Stanford students, and
the exchange of students not only
for formal and independent study
but for related intereultural activ
ities.
The contemplated student ex
change program is based upon
the pattern established in the

I Berlin and Keio Affiliations. How
ever, several additional features
have been projected and are now
being developed. Stanford stu
dents from Africa are working
with the African Desk in the iden
tification of opportunities in Afri
can countries and in the refine
ment of plans.
A Provincial Educational Offi
cer from Kenya, who visited Stan
ford recently, offered to assist
with several of the key arrange
ments. Other distinguished visi
tors from Africa have expressed
interest in the program, including
an administrative officer from the
University of Pretoria, traveling
in the United States under the
auspices of the Carnegie Founda
tion, and the Director of African
Affairs of the American Friends
Society. The letter published in
the DAILY from Mr. Mgobi, mem
ber of the Uganda Parliament, is
a further example of support be
ing offered from Africa.
A unique feature in the project
is that it was conceived and de
veloped by Stanford students.
They have established in the ITR
the African Desk, now including
some seventy members. Their
energetic efforts have earned tho
respect and encouragement of
many Stanford faculty members
and officers. The letters in the
DAILY from Professor Stone and
Dean McCord are indicative.
Because of the scope of those

I plans, outside financial support
' obviously will be required. Un
doubtedly, a major factor in the
attraction of such support will
I be evidence of a broadly-based
and continuing commitment on
the part of the Stanford Student
Body to Afro-American intercul
tural exchange. The response of
the Stanford students generally
to the activities of the African
Desk may well determine the ex
tent of such support and, accord
ingly, the ultimate success of this
commendable project.

As a member of LASSU, I
would like to answer Mr. Rank
in's article, "I Move We Table . . ."
The resolution introduced at
Legislature Thursday night to
endorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was discussed in house
meetings at Lagunita and I was
asked: "Are you the representa
tive from Lagunita to Legisla
ture, or are you the representa
tive of Legislature to Lagunita?"
This question must be answered
before criticizing Legislature
members for being cautious and
wanting to discuss issues with
I their constituents.
In my "opinion a Legislature
member is a liaison between his
' constituents and Legislature and
j between Legislature and his con
stituents. Recommendations and
i resolutions should travel both
ways for discussion.
Legislature members must ac
cept their responsibility as stu
dent leaders and take action when
they are well informed on an
issue and immediate action is
necessary. The resolution to en
dorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was presented to each
1 member of Legislature Thursday

night. Few of them had seen the
resolution before.
The Peace Corps had been dis
cussed only slightly among stu
dents. It would have been based
upon personal feeling or upon
Mr. Erickson's argument against
endorsement.
I i'et'l that Legislature should
consider such "outside issues" as
directly affect students, and the
Peace Corps is such an issue. But
Legislature has a duty, because
it speaks for the Stanford student
body, to be informed, to he aware
of the feeling of the students,
and not to make hasty, ignorant
decisions. The Peace Corps will
not have lost its importance or
relevancy when it is brought to
a vote tonight.
Joy Howard
Editor, the Daily:
I have heard that some people
at Stanford are disturbed by the
recent banner-dropping episode at
Pisa, fearing that the reputation
of both the University and the
United States may have been
marred by the action. Such con
cern is understandable in view
of the sorry record of many
American tourists in the field of
foreign relations; but in this case
I can testify that the fear is com
pletely unwarranted.
I happened to be in Pisa at the
time as an unwitting fellow trav
eler and saw the whole operation.
The students, as always in my
observation, were courteous
to the townspeople and in no way
objectionable. They d id th e i r
stunt with ingenuity and des
patch, with the entire affair last
ing only a few minutes. No one
was hurt, no property was dam
aged, and Italian sensibilities
were not bruised. For a short
time the local constabulary was
a bit agitated, but upon learning
the import of the message draped
over the leaning tower, all signs
of annoyance vanished in a gen
eral spirit of camaraderie.
I hope that this account will
ease any doubts that may have

arisen at homo about student be
havior in Italy. If we havo noth
ing more than this to worry over,
we are well off.

In the 10 years I have been
with the Oregon Suite Beavers,
I have witnessed an even 100
football games at home and on
the road. Never have 1 seen a
student body put out the effort
to help their team as 1 witnessed
at Stanford Saturday.
Under the worst of weather
conditions, your students did
their damnedest to boost Cactus
Jack and his Indians to victory.
Our Oregon Staters (including
the press, radio and post-televi
sion crew) were highly impressed
with the hundreds of students
coming clown onto the field at
halftime to yell encouragement
to Stanford.
As a result, Stanford made an
all-out effort to beat us but failed
by the slimmest of margins. I'm
sure your fine coach appreciates
the efforts of the Stanford stu
dents.
It is gratifying to see that Stan

school spirit is not old fashioned

Along with our established
overseas programs, the African
Project is an evidence of Stan
ford's increasing interest in In
ternationa] Affairs and in crea
tive approaches to independent
study. This project is also an
other in a series of important and
stimulating activities sponsored
by the Institute of International
Relations in the last dozen years.
These activities have included the
original Model United Nations
Assembly on the Pacific Coast,
Foreign Policy Institutes, High
School UNESCO Conferences,
Student Exchanges, Affiliations
with the Student Bodies of the
Free University of Berlin, Keio
University and Moscow Univer
sity, as well as several others.
In many respects, the African
Project is the most ambitious and
imaginative of these activities to
date. The African Desk has shown
commendable resourcefulness and
creativeness in the marshalling of
local resources for African
studies. Plans which are being
developed are comprehensive.
They involve serious study of
Africa by Stanford students, and
the exchange of students not only
for formal and independent study
but for related intereultural activ
ities.
The contemplated student ex
change program is based upon
the pattern established in the

I Berlin and Keio Affiliations. How
ever, several additional features
have been projected and are now
being developed. Stanford stu
dents from Africa are working
with the African Desk in the iden
tification of opportunities in Afri
can countries and in the refine
ment of plans.
A Provincial Educational Offi
cer from Kenya, who visited Stan
ford recently, offered to assist
with several of the key arrange
ments. Other distinguished visi
tors from Africa have expressed
interest in the program, including
an administrative officer from the
University of Pretoria, traveling
in the United States under the
auspices of the Carnegie Founda
tion, and the Director of African
Affairs of the American Friends
Society. The letter published in
the DAILY from Mr. Mgobi, mem
ber of the Uganda Parliament, is
a further example of support be
ing offered from Africa.
A unique feature in the project
is that it was conceived and de
veloped by Stanford students.
They have established in the ITR
the African Desk, now including
some seventy members. Their
energetic efforts have earned tho
respect and encouragement of
many Stanford faculty members
and officers. The letters in the
DAILY from Professor Stone and
Dean McCord are indicative.
Because of the scope of those

I plans, outside financial support
' obviously will be required. Un
doubtedly, a major factor in the
attraction of such support will
I be evidence of a broadly-based
and continuing commitment on
the part of the Stanford Student

As a member of LASSU, I
would like to answer Mr. Rank
in's article, "I Move We Table . . ."
The resolution introduced at
Legislature Thursday night to
endorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was discussed in house
meetings at Lagunita and I was
asked: "Are you the representa
tive from Lagunita to Legisla
ture, or are you the representa
tive of Legislature to Lagunita?"
This question must be answered
before criticizing Legislature
members for being cautious and
wanting to discuss issues with
I their constituents.
In my "opinion a Legislature
member is a liaison between his
' constituents and Legislature and
j between Legislature and his con
stituents. Recommendations and
i resolutions should travel both
ways for discussion.
Legislature members must ac
cept their responsibility as stu
dent leaders and take action when
they are well informed on an
issue and immediate action is
necessary. The resolution to en
dorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was presented to each
1 member of Legislature Thursday

night. Few of them had seen the
resolution before.
The Peace Corps had been dis
cussed only slightly among stu
dents. It would have been based
upon personal feeling or upon
Mr. Erickson's argument against
endorsement.
I i'et'l that Legislature should
consider such "outside issues" as
directly affect students, and the
Peace Corps is such an issue. But
Legislature has a duty, because
it speaks for the Stanford student
body, to be informed, to he aware
of the feeling of the students,
and not to make hasty, ignorant
decisions. The Peace Corps will
not have lost its importance or
relevancy when it is brought to
a vote tonight.

I have heard that some people
at Stanford are disturbed by the
recent banner-dropping episode at
Pisa, fearing that the reputation
of both the University and the
United States may have been
marred by the action. Such con
cern is understandable in view
of the sorry record of many
American tourists in the field of
foreign relations; but in this case
I can testify that the fear is com
pletely unwarranted.
I happened to be in Pisa at the
time as an unwitting fellow trav
eler and saw the whole operation.
The students, as always in my
observation, were courteous
to the townspeople and in no way
objectionable. They d id th e i r
stunt with ingenuity and des
patch, with the entire affair last
ing only a few minutes. No one
was hurt, no property was dam
aged, and Italian sensibilities
were not bruised. For a short
time the local constabulary was
a bit agitated, but upon learning
the import of the message draped

Under the worst of weather

their damnedest to boost Cactus

Our Oregon Staters (including

As a result, Stanford made an

Along with our established
overseas programs, the African
Project is an evidence of Stan
ford's increasing interest in In
ternationa] Affairs and in crea
tive approaches to independent
study. This project is also an
other in a series of important and
stimulating activities sponsored
by the Institute of International
Relations in the last dozen years.
These activities have included the
original Model United Nations
Assembly on the Pacific Coast,
Foreign Policy Institutes, High
School UNESCO Conferences,
Student Exchanges, Affiliations
with the Student Bodies of the
Free University of Berlin, Keio
University and Moscow Univer
sity, as well as several others.
In many respects, the African
Project is the most ambitious and
imaginative of these activities to
date. The African Desk has shown
commendable resourcefulness and
creativeness in the marshalling of
local resources for African
studies. Plans which are being
developed are comprehensive.
They involve serious study of
Africa by Stanford students, and
the exchange of students not only
for formal and independent study
but for related intereultural activ
ities.
The contemplated student ex
change program is based upon
the pattern established in the

I Berlin and Keio Affiliations. How
ever, several additional features
have been projected and are now
being developed. Stanford stu
dents from Africa are working
with the African Desk in the iden
tification of opportunities in Afri
can countries and in the refine
ment of plans.
A Provincial Educational Offi
cer from Kenya, who visited Stan
ford recently, offered to assist
with several of the key arrange
ments. Other distinguished visi
tors from Africa have expressed
interest in the program, including
an administrative officer from the
University of Pretoria, traveling
in the United States under the
auspices of the Carnegie Founda
tion, and the Director of African
Affairs of the American Friends
Society. The letter published in
the DAILY from Mr. Mgobi, mem
ber of the Uganda Parliament, is
a further example of support be
ing offered from Africa.
A unique feature in the project
is that it was conceived and de
veloped by Stanford students.
They have established in the ITR
the African Desk, now including
some seventy members. Their
energetic efforts have earned tho
respect and encouragement of
many Stanford faculty members
and officers. The letters in the
DAILY from Professor Stone and
Dean McCord are indicative.
Because of the scope of those

I plans, outside financial support
' obviously will be required. Un
doubtedly, a major factor in the
attraction of such support will
I be evidence of a broadly-based
and continuing commitment on
the part of the Stanford Student
Body to Afro-American intercul

the Stanford students generally
to the activities of the African

As a member of LASSU, I
would like to answer Mr. Rank
in's article, "I Move We Table . . ."
The resolution introduced at
Legislature Thursday night to
endorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was discussed in house
meetings at Lagunita and I was
asked: "Are you the representa
tive from Lagunita to Legisla
ture, or are you the representa
tive of Legislature to Lagunita?"
This question must be answered
before criticizing Legislature
members for being cautious and
wanting to discuss issues with
I their constituents.
In my "opinion a Legislature
member is a liaison between his
' constituents and Legislature and
j between Legislature and his con
stituents. Recommendations and
i resolutions should travel both
ways for discussion.
Legislature members must ac
cept their responsibility as stu
dent leaders and take action when
they are well informed on an
issue and immediate action is
necessary. The resolution to en
dorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was presented to each
1 member of Legislature Thursday

night. Few of them had seen the
resolution before.
The Peace Corps had been dis
cussed only slightly among stu
dents. It would have been based
upon personal feeling or upon
Mr. Erickson's argument against
endorsement.
I i'et'l that Legislature should
consider such "outside issues" as
directly affect students, and the
Peace Corps is such an issue. But
Legislature has a duty, because
it speaks for the Stanford student
body, to be informed, to he aware
of the feeling of the students,
and not to make hasty, ignorant
decisions. The Peace Corps will
not have lost its importance or
relevancy when it is brought to
a vote tonight.

I have heard that some people
at Stanford are disturbed by the
recent banner-dropping episode at
Pisa, fearing that the reputation
of both the University and the
United States may have been
marred by the action. Such con
cern is understandable in view
of the sorry record of many
American tourists in the field of
foreign relations; but in this case
I can testify that the fear is com
pletely unwarranted.
I happened to be in Pisa at the
time as an unwitting fellow trav
eler and saw the whole operation.
The students, as always in my
observation, were courteous
to the townspeople and in no way
objectionable. They d id th e i r
stunt with ingenuity and des
patch, with the entire affair last
ing only a few minutes. No one
was hurt, no property was dam
aged, and Italian sensibilities
were not bruised. For a short
time the local constabulary was
a bit agitated, but upon learning
the import of the message draped
over the leaning tower, all signs
of annoyance vanished in a gen
eral spirit of camaraderie.
I hope that this account will
ease any doubts that may have

arisen at homo about student be

Along with our established

other in a series of important and
stimulating activities sponsored

Student Exchanges, Affiliations
with the Student Bodies of the

In many respects, the African
Project is the most ambitious and
imaginative of these activities to
date. The African Desk has shown
commendable resourcefulness and
creativeness in the marshalling of
local resources for African
studies. Plans which are being
developed are comprehensive.
They involve serious study of
Africa by Stanford students, and
the exchange of students not only
for formal and independent study
but for related intereultural activ
ities.
The contemplated student ex
change program is based upon
the pattern established in the

I Berlin and Keio Affiliations. How
ever, several additional features
have been projected and are now
being developed. Stanford stu

with the African Desk in the iden
tification of opportunities in Afri
can countries and in the refine
ment of plans.
A Provincial Educational Offi

with several of the key arrange

interest in the program, including
an administrative officer from the
University of Pretoria, traveling

Affairs of the American Friends

Because of the scope of those

I be evidence of a broadly-based

As a member of LASSU, I

in's article, "I Move We Table . . ."
The resolution introduced at
Legislature Thursday night to
endorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was discussed in house
meetings at Lagunita and I was
asked: "Are you the representa
tive from Lagunita to Legisla
ture, or are you the representa
tive of Legislature to Lagunita?"
This question must be answered
before criticizing Legislature
members for being cautious and
wanting to discuss issues with
I their constituents.
In my "opinion a Legislature
member is a liaison between his
' constituents and Legislature and
j between Legislature and his con
stituents. Recommendations and
i resolutions should travel both
ways for discussion.
Legislature members must ac
cept their responsibility as stu
dent leaders and take action when
they are well informed on an
issue and immediate action is
necessary. The resolution to en
dorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was presented to each
1 member of Legislature Thursday

night. Few of them had seen the
resolution before.
The Peace Corps had been dis
cussed only slightly among stu
dents. It would have been based
upon personal feeling or upon
Mr. Erickson's argument against
endorsement.
I i'et'l that Legislature should
consider such "outside issues" as
directly affect students, and the
Peace Corps is such an issue. But
Legislature has a duty, because
it speaks for the Stanford student
body, to be informed, to he aware
of the feeling of the students,
and not to make hasty, ignorant
decisions. The Peace Corps will
not have lost its importance or
relevancy when it is brought to
a vote tonight.

I have heard that some people
at Stanford are disturbed by the
recent banner-dropping episode at
Pisa, fearing that the reputation
of both the University and the
United States may have been
marred by the action. Such con
cern is understandable in view
of the sorry record of many
American tourists in the field of
foreign relations; but in this case
I can testify that the fear is com
pletely unwarranted.
I happened to be in Pisa at the
time as an unwitting fellow trav
eler and saw the whole operation.
The students, as always in my
observation, were courteous
to the townspeople and in no way
objectionable. They d id th e i r
stunt with ingenuity and des
patch, with the entire affair last

In the 10 years I have been
with the Oregon Suite Beavers,
I have witnessed an even 100
football games at home and on
the road. Never have 1 seen a
student body put out the effort
to help their team as 1 witnessed
at Stanford Saturday.
Under the worst of weather
conditions, your students did
their damnedest to boost Cactus
Jack and his Indians to victory.
Our Oregon Staters (including
the press, radio and post-televi
sion crew) were highly impressed
with the hundreds of students
coming clown onto the field at
halftime to yell encouragement
to Stanford.
As a result, Stanford made an
all-out effort to beat us but failed
by the slimmest of margins. I'm
sure your fine coach appreciates
the efforts of the Stanford stu
dents.
It is gratifying to see that Stan
ford students (and our OSC stu
dents. too) recognize that true
school spirit is not old fashioned
or undignified.

Along with our established
overseas programs, the African
Project is an evidence of Stan
ford's increasing interest in In
ternationa] Affairs and in crea
tive approaches to independent
study. This project is also an
other in a series of important and
stimulating activities sponsored
by the Institute of International
Relations in the last dozen years.
These activities have included the
original Model United Nations
Assembly on the Pacific Coast,
Foreign Policy Institutes, High
School UNESCO Conferences,
Student Exchanges, Affiliations
with the Student Bodies of the
Free University of Berlin, Keio
University and Moscow Univer
sity, as well as several others.
In many respects, the African
Project is the most ambitious and
imaginative of these activities to
date. The African Desk has shown
commendable resourcefulness and
creativeness in the marshalling of
local resources for African
studies. Plans which are being
developed are comprehensive.
They involve serious study of
Africa by Stanford students, and
the exchange of students not only
for formal and independent study
but for related intereultural activ
ities.
The contemplated student ex
change program is based upon
the pattern established in the

I Berlin and Keio Affiliations. How
ever, several additional features
have been projected and are now
being developed. Stanford stu
dents from Africa are working
with the African Desk in the iden
tification of opportunities in Afri
can countries and in the refine
ment of plans.
A Provincial Educational Offi
cer from Kenya, who visited Stan
ford recently, offered to assist
with several of the key arrange
ments. Other distinguished visi
tors from Africa have expressed
interest in the program, including
an administrative officer from the
University of Pretoria, traveling
in the United States under the
auspices of the Carnegie Founda
tion, and the Director of African
Affairs of the American Friends
Society. The letter published in
the DAILY from Mr. Mgobi, mem
ber of the Uganda Parliament, is
a further example of support be
ing offered from Africa.
A unique feature in the project
is that it was conceived and de
veloped by Stanford students.
They have established in the ITR
the African Desk, now including
some seventy members. Their
energetic efforts have earned tho
respect and encouragement of
many Stanford faculty members
and officers. The letters in the
DAILY from Professor Stone and
Dean McCord are indicative.
Because of the scope of those

I plans, outside financial support
' obviously will be required. Un
doubtedly, a major factor in the
attraction of such support will
I be evidence of a broadly-based
and continuing commitment on
the part of the Stanford Student
Body to Afro-American intercul
tural exchange. The response of
the Stanford students generally
to the activities of the African
Desk may well determine the ex
tent of such support and, accord
ingly, the ultimate success of this
commendable project.

As a member of LASSU, I
would like to answer Mr. Rank
in's article, "I Move We Table . . ."
The resolution introduced at
Legislature Thursday night to
endorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was discussed in house
meetings at Lagunita and I was
asked: "Are you the representa
tive from Lagunita to Legisla
ture, or are you the representa
tive of Legislature to Lagunita?"
This question must be answered
before criticizing Legislature
members for being cautious and
wanting to discuss issues with
I their constituents.
In my "opinion a Legislature
member is a liaison between his
' constituents and Legislature and
j between Legislature and his con
stituents. Recommendations and
i resolutions should travel both
ways for discussion.
Legislature members must ac
cept their responsibility as stu
dent leaders and take action when
they are well informed on an
issue and immediate action is
necessary. The resolution to en
dorse "in principle" the Peace
Corps was presented to each
1 member of Legislature Thursday

night. Few of them had seen the
resolution before.
The Peace Corps had been dis
cussed only slightly among stu
dents. It would have been based
upon personal feeling or upon
Mr. Erickson's argument against
endorsement.
I i'et'l that Legislature should
consider such "outside issues" as
directly affect students, and the
Peace Corps is such an issue. But
Legislature has a duty, because
it speaks for the Stanford student
body, to be informed, to he aware
of the feeling of the students,
and not to make hasty, ignorant
decisions. The Peace Corps will
not have lost its importance or
relevancy when it is brought to
a vote tonight.

I have heard that some people
at Stanford are disturbed by the
recent banner-dropping episode at
Pisa, fearing that the reputation
of both the University and the

of the sorry record of many
American tourists in the field of
foreign relations; but in this case
I can testify that the fear is com
pletely unwarranted.
