## ROTC—An Incongruity 
### 
While driving past the Pavilion
toward Toyon the other day, we
were suddenly forced to halt as a
column of olive drab-clad Stan
ford men marched past in front
of us—rifles at their shoulders —
"sounding off" in a near scream.
As we idled there for a couple
of minutes waiting for the troops
to file by, the incongruity of the
situation struck us.
Here, at one of the nation's
greatest universities, students are
being taught the rudiments of
warfare — something which
should be anathema to any insti
tution of learning, or any think
ing person.
Valuable hours are taken up by
such ROTC courses as "Crew
Served Weapons and Gunnery,"
"Evolution of the Art of War"
and "Amphibious Warfare."
In the past year there has
arisen a noticeable outcry among
groups at colleges around the
country against ROTC, whether
it be voluntary—as here—or com
pulsory.
Many students, this one in
cluded, would like to see ROTC
done away with completely.
While we feel that a strong na
tional defense force is necessary
(with a determination to use it IF
WE MUST), we think that the
armed forces should not be al
lowed to run ROTC units at col
leges. With some imagination and
perhaps a needed revamp of our
defense structure, we believe the
services could manage to over
come the loss of officers the cut
ting off of ROTC would bring.
We would much rather see the
time, energy and units now spent
(up to 36 units here) on ROTC
channeled into other course s
which contribute to one's intel
lectual development.
After all, one of the prime func
tions and responsibilities of any
university is to try to instill in
its students the belief that man
I CAN live with his neighbor with
out recourse to violence when
they disagree.
While it is obvious that in this
I age we unfortunately must have
, armies and terrifying weapons to
defend what we know to be right,
we do not need to train men in
universities in the "art" of war
fare.
Rather, we should imbue them
with the spirit that if they use
their learning and spend some
hard work and time on it, peace—
a real peace—can be achieved.
Let the professional militarists
take care of war planning and
training. Let them do this away
from the college campus. Let the
students prepare and train for
peace. They will get all the mili
tary training they need when they

are drafted, unless they're for
tunate enough to be chosen for a
Peace Corps—provided Congress
has sense enough to establish it.
Some people hold the view that
ROTC is necessary so that in the
next war the troops will have
trained leadership. It seems io
us that the next war will either
be big or little. If little, the pro
fessionals and standing army can
handle it. If big, there will be no
time for a draft, call up of re
serves or anything else. There
will be no troops to lead, and no
one to lead them.
So we say there is no need for
ItOTC, that its presence on a uni
versity campus is uncalled for,
that the nature of its military
discipline is just the opposite of
the i ii (I epe n d ence and free
thought which a good university
must encourage.
And perhaps, if humans would
prepare for peace rather than
war, the time will come when
there are no armies, no military
men and no weapons for them.
Maybe then the entry in the
red and white Stanford Courses
and Degrees book will not read
"Evolution of the Art of War,"
but "History of Wars—From
First to the Last."
