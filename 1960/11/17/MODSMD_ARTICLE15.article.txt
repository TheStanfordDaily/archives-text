How big is Big Game?
In a week highlighted by Lick the Bear Day, Nuts to the Bear
Day, Axe the Bear Day, Wax the Bear Day and on and on around
these parts, as well as similiar institutions at that other school, may
be a service can lie performed in this space.
Stanford Sports Publicity Director Don Liebendorfer tells a story

which should put Big Game in a
certain amount of perspective.
Buck in tli«* days when football
teams travelled by trains —it
wasn't that long ago but Boil
admits to having been around
here for quite a while —Stanford
played its intersectional contests
after Big Game.
Thus it was that in 1928 the In
dians were to travel to New York
to meet a highly regarded Army
team the week after Big Game.
Liebendorfer always travels a
week ahead of the team and he
puller! into New York in time to
see the Cadets play against Ne
braska. Andy Kerr, who had been
an assistant coach on the Farm
under Pop Warner, went to the
game with Liebendorfer. Big
Game was being played the same
day on the West Coast.
The two some took their time

after the Army-Nebraska game was over and by the time Lieben
dorfer had returned to his hotel lie figured that the Big Game must
he just about over.
"I called the first newspaper that came to mind," Don says,"the
Herald Tribune 1 think, and shouted, 'Who won Big Game?'"
" 'What Itig Game?' sneered a voice at the other end of the phone."
"There I was, a real country boy in the big city. I didn't even
stop to think that there are about 50 'big games' in the New York
area alone.
"Anyhow, I said as apologetically as I could that I wanted to
know the score of the Stanford-California game.
"'Just a minute,' the voice said, 'I'll see if anyone ever heard
of it.'
"Well, I'll swear he shuffled every paper in that office right next
to the phone and it must have been five minutes before he came
hack on the line.
"Finally he picked up the phone, growled, 'It was a tie,' and
banged down the phone.
"I was so embarrassed that I had to wait to read the New York
Times the next morning to find out what the score was. It was 13-13."
So much for putting Big Game into perspective. It will come back
out of that state in tomorrow's Daily. On to other things.
Time for a Change
Yesterday the Daily reported that Stanford's soccer team, though
it still has a chance at the West Coast Soccer League title, was
voted out of a chance to Represent the league in the national cham
pionships to be held next week in St. Louis and Brooklyn.
Cal's soccer team will go instead, even though Stanford meets
the Rears to decide the league championship Saturday.
The decision to send Cal was made Monday by the Far West Soc
cer Committee on a basis of total points scored by the two teams.
Cal has scored 36 goals during the season while Stanford has
scored 24.
The decision had to be made before the league championship was
decided because the West Coast representative has to leave for
St. Louis Saturday directly after the Cal-Stanford game and there
would not have been enough time for travel arrangements to bo
made. The possibility thus exists that the West Coast will not be
sending its strongest representative to the playoffs.
Actually, presuming that the decision IIAI) to be made before
the league championship was'decided, the committee probably made
the correct decision. Cal does seem to have the stronger team.
However, if the Indians win Saturday the committee will have
done itself. Stanford and Cal an injustice, the prevention of which
certainly would have been easy enough.
The reason why this all-important game couldn't have been played
earlier this week escapes us. As a matter of fact it seems as though it
was very sloppy scheduling that allowed this impasse to have been
reached in the first place.
Also the use of total points scored seems to us to be a very bad
yardstick by which to measure a team. It is standard practice for
some teams, once it gets a comfortable lead, to put in its second
string players to give them experience. This, naturally, keeps the
teams from scoring as many goals as they otherwise might have.
If, all of a sudden, there appears a good reason for running up
a high -score against weak opponents, such as a possible trip to the
national championships, we can only expect that the better teams
in the league will be out for blood and try to run the score up as
high as possible.
Certainly, if this method of picking the league representative
continues, we can expect Stanford Coach Fred Priddle to have
learned his lesson.
At any rate the Stanford soccer team is in a good position to
force a re-evaluation of the current method of choosing the repre
sentative. All it has to do is murder Cal.

The decision had to be made before the league championship was
decided because the West Coast representative has to leave for
St. Louis Saturday directly after the Cal-Stanford game and there
would not have been enough time for travel arrangements to bo
made. The possibility thus exists that the West Coast will not be
sending its strongest representative to the playoffs.
Actually, presuming that the decision IIAI) to be made before
the league championship was'decided, the committee probably made
the correct decision. Cal does seem to have the stronger team.
However, if the Indians win Saturday the committee will have
done itself. Stanford and Cal an injustice, the prevention of which
certainly would have been easy enough.
The reason why this all-important game couldn't have been played
earlier this week escapes us. As a matter of fact it seems as though it
was very sloppy scheduling that allowed this impasse to have been
reached in the first place.
Also the use of total points scored seems to us to be a very bad
yardstick by which to measure a team. It is standard practice for
some teams, once it gets a comfortable lead, to put in its second
string players to give them experience. This, naturally, keeps the
teams from scoring as many goals as they otherwise might have.
If, all of a sudden, there appears a good reason for running up
a high -score against weak opponents, such as a possible trip to the
national championships, we can only expect that the better teams
in the league will be out for blood and try to run the score up as
high as possible.
Certainly, if this method of picking the league representative
continues, we can expect Stanford Coach Fred Priddle to have
learned his lesson.
At any rate the Stanford soccer team is in a good position to
force a re-evaluation of the current method of choosing the repre
sentative. All it has to do is murder Cal.

Who Won Big Came?'
How big is Big Game?
In a week highlighted by Lick the Bear Day, Nuts to the Bear
Day, Axe the Bear Day, Wax the Bear Day and on and on around
these parts, as well as similiar institutions at that other school, may
be a service can lie performed in this space.
Stanford Sports Publicity Director Don Liebendorfer tells a story

which should put Big Game in a
certain amount of perspective.
Buck in tli«* days when football
teams travelled by trains —it
wasn't that long ago but Boil
admits to having been around
here for quite a while —Stanford
played its intersectional contests
after Big Game.
Thus it was that in 1928 the In
dians were to travel to New York
to meet a highly regarded Army
team the week after Big Game.
Liebendorfer always travels a
week ahead of the team and he
puller! into New York in time to
see the Cadets play against Ne
braska. Andy Kerr, who had been
an assistant coach on the Farm
under Pop Warner, went to the
game with Liebendorfer. Big
Game was being played the same
day on the West Coast.
The two some took their time

after the Army-Nebraska game was over and by the time Lieben
dorfer had returned to his hotel lie figured that the Big Game must
he just about over.
"I called the first newspaper that came to mind," Don says,"the
Herald Tribune 1 think, and shouted, 'Who won Big Game?'"
" 'What Itig Game?' sneered a voice at the other end of the phone."
"There I was, a real country boy in the big city. I didn't even
stop to think that there are about 50 'big games' in the New York
area alone.
"Anyhow, I said as apologetically as I could that I wanted to
know the score of the Stanford-California game.
"'Just a minute,' the voice said, 'I'll see if anyone ever heard
of it.'
"Well, I'll swear he shuffled every paper in that office right next
to the phone and it must have been five minutes before he came
hack on the line.
"Finally he picked up the phone, growled, 'It was a tie,' and
banged down the phone.
"I was so embarrassed that I had to wait to read the New York
Times the next morning to find out what the score was. It was 13-13."
So much for putting Big Game into perspective. It will come back
out of that state in tomorrow's Daily. On to other things.
Time for a Change
Yesterday the Daily reported that Stanford's soccer team, though
it still has a chance at the West Coast Soccer League title, was
voted out of a chance to Represent the league in the national cham
pionships to be held next week in St. Louis and Brooklyn.
Cal's soccer team will go instead, even though Stanford meets
the Rears to decide the league championship Saturday.
The decision to send Cal was made Monday by the Far West Soc
cer Committee on a basis of total points scored by the two teams.
Cal has scored 36 goals during the season while Stanford has
scored 24.

dorfer had returned to his hotel lie figured that the Big Game must
he just about over.
"I called the first newspaper that came to mind," Don says,"the
Herald Tribune 1 think, and shouted, 'Who won Big Game?'"
" 'What Itig Game?' sneered a voice at the other end of the phone."
"There I was, a real country boy in the big city. I didn't even
stop to think that there are about 50 'big games' in the New York
area alone.
"Anyhow, I said as apologetically as I could that I wanted to
know the score of the Stanford-California game.
"'Just a minute,' the voice said, 'I'll see if anyone ever heard
of it.'
"Well, I'll swear he shuffled every paper in that office right next
to the phone and it must have been five minutes before he came
hack on the line.
"Finally he picked up the phone, growled, 'It was a tie,' and
banged down the phone.
"I was so embarrassed that I had to wait to read the New York
Times the next morning to find out what the score was. It was 13-13."
So much for putting Big Game into perspective. It will come back
out of that state in tomorrow's Daily. On to other things.
Time for a Change
Yesterday the Daily reported that Stanford's soccer team, though
it still has a chance at the West Coast Soccer League title, was
voted out of a chance to Represent the league in the national cham
pionships to be held next week in St. Louis and Brooklyn.
Cal's soccer team will go instead, even though Stanford meets
the Rears to decide the league championship Saturday.
The decision to send Cal was made Monday by the Far West Soc
cer Committee on a basis of total points scored by the two teams.
Cal has scored 36 goals during the season while Stanford has
scored 24.
The decision had to be made before the league championship was
decided because the West Coast representative has to leave for
St. Louis Saturday directly after the Cal-Stanford game and there
would not have been enough time for travel arrangements to bo
made. The possibility thus exists that the West Coast will not be
sending its strongest representative to the playoffs.
Actually, presuming that the decision IIAI) to be made before
the league championship was'decided, the committee probably made
the correct decision. Cal does seem to have the stronger team.
However, if the Indians win Saturday the committee will have
done itself. Stanford and Cal an injustice, the prevention of which
certainly would have been easy enough.
The reason why this all-important game couldn't have been played
earlier this week escapes us. As a matter of fact it seems as though it
was very sloppy scheduling that allowed this impasse to have been
reached in the first place.
Also the use of total points scored seems to us to be a very bad
yardstick by which to measure a team. It is standard practice for
some teams, once it gets a comfortable lead, to put in its second
string players to give them experience. This, naturally, keeps the
teams from scoring as many goals as they otherwise might have.
If, all of a sudden, there appears a good reason for running up
a high -score against weak opponents, such as a possible trip to the
national championships, we can only expect that the better teams
in the league will be out for blood and try to run the score up as
high as possible.
Certainly, if this method of picking the league representative
continues, we can expect Stanford Coach Fred Priddle to have
learned his lesson.
At any rate the Stanford soccer team is in a good position to
force a re-evaluation of the current method of choosing the repre
sentative. All it has to do is murder Cal.

How big is Big Game?
In a week highlighted by Lick the Bear Day, Nuts to the Bear
Day, Axe the Bear Day, Wax the Bear Day and on and on around
these parts, as well as similiar institutions at that other school, may
be a service can lie performed in this space.
Stanford Sports Publicity Director Don Liebendorfer tells a story

which should put Big Game in a
certain amount of perspective.
Buck in tli«* days when football
teams travelled by trains —it
wasn't that long ago but Boil
admits to having been around
here for quite a while —Stanford
played its intersectional contests
after Big Game.
Thus it was that in 1928 the In
dians were to travel to New York
to meet a highly regarded Army
team the week after Big Game.
Liebendorfer always travels a
week ahead of the team and he
puller! into New York in time to

an assistant coach on the Farm
under Pop Warner, went to the
