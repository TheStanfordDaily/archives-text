Stanford's football team should
be in good shape for the big one,
up at Cal Sat u r d a y as Card
trainer Connie Jarvis said that
the squad is practically injury
free.
Jarvis said that he's never seen
a Stanford team in better shape
for Big Game and, except for a
few aches and bruises, the whole
team should be physically ready
for an all-out performance.
ERROL SCOTT and Ron Fer
nandes, two of the Indians' tough
est linemen who had been out
with injuries, were given the
green light for Saturday and will
bo a welcome addition to Jack
Curtice's charges.
John Buflcr, the Indians' star
defensive linebacker, should be
ready to go at full strength for
the Cards. Butler was out of the
second half of the Oregon State
game last week because of a char
leyhorse.
Curtice is taking no chances on
any of the players getting hurt
during practice this week and has
scheduled no contact drills. The
Tribe is instead concentrating on
a few new offensive wrinkles for
the Bears and is also going over
the defensive assignment to try
and close some of the holes.
CURTICE had words of praise
for the work of sophomore end
Steve Pursell last week. Pursell's
defensive work was excellent and
he snagged some passes in fine
style.
The Tribe will go into the game
as a slight underdog as the Las
Vegas odds-makers have estab
lished Cal as a 3 1 a-point favorite
the New York bettors like Cal
by four points.
