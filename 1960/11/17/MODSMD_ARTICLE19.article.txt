# Missouri Tackles Powerful Kansas
## 
### 
Missouri, the nation's top team,
puts its unblemished record on
the line this Saturday in the
country's top game. The Jay
hawks of Kansas â€” an old rival
and always a dangerous opponent
smothered a good Colorado
team last week by the score of
34-6. Although Missouri is No. 1
in both wire service polls and
Kansas is not even ranked in the
top twenty, the oddsmakers have
installed the Tigers as just a
shaky seven-point favorite.
