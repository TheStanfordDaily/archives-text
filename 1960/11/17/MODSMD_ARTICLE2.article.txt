# Self-Portrait Spoof Highlights Gaieties
## 
### EMMY LOU BUCHANAN Drama Critic 
I was 10 years old when I saw my first show and until Tuesday
night il was my only theater experience. But I broke down and went
to "Gaieties" and even stayed for the second act. Fortunately.
The last half (if the two-and-a-half-hour show makes the first half
worth sitting through. And even the first part is worth the price

of a ticket.
Parodies of such untouchable
Farm familiarities as The Daily,
Health Service and Happy Hours
are featured, under the direction
of Jim Gleason. hut Ram's Head
proves that it is most capable of
making fun of itself.
The second-act "Break a Leg"
skil, which illustrates what can
happen opening night if a show
has a good dress rehearsal, is the
highlight of the production.
Doug Johnson is hilarious as
the actor who goes through re
hearsal without a hitch then
puts his arm through the stage
set when he tries to kiss the girl
during the real performance. He
is ably supported in this parody
by Phemie Brownell and John
Harrop.
ANOTHER good second-act
number is the Health Service
sketch, "Do We Feel Sick?"

"Big: Game Gaieties" will con
tinue tonight a( 8:30 and tomor
row night at {)::{() in Memorial
Auditorium. Tickets, priced at
$1, $1.50 and $3 are available at
the Mem Ami Box Office.

Tribute is paid to those ever
faithful, diligent dorm mainstays,
the hashers, in the first half of
the show, when the audience sees
them as they are sure to be seen
Sunday Morning after Big Game.
Ent i 11 ed "Sunny Side. Funny
Side Up," the song-skit is humor
ous and well done.
The Daily parody is . . . well, a
parody. Ram's Head evidently en
listed fifth column forces for this
one but fails to take full ad
vantage of the material in the
Shack. Although it scores at
times, the satirical skit treads too
lightly.
THE TWO BiG dance numbers
are imaginative and well done.
Choreographer M a rgot Jones
uses the bookstore setting as a
fine excuse for six brief, inter-
esting numbers in the first act.
Along with Miss Jones, Corrine
Kason and Carol Jean Thompson
are the soloists; all three are ex
cellent dancers.
Six men also danced in this
number and while their lack of
technique is obvious, they do an
amazingly good job.
The second-act dance number.
"Custer's Last Stand," features
good musical accompaniment,
bright costumes and good chore
ography which results in a dif
ferent type of chorus-line num
ber. The dancing itself is likewise
good.
The pace of the first act is
slowed considerably by the sec
ond number, "On the Quad in the
Full of the Moon." The words of
the song are lost; the song itself
is much too slow to appear near
the beginning of a show such as
"Gaieties."
Steve Sandlin is the male vocal
ist in this number and although
he has a good voice, he needs to
project his voice more.
Sandlin also sings in the Happy
Hour skit—another song which
unfortunately just doesn't fit in
with the show. The situation of
an ID-less Stanford man is paro
died well in this number, but the
whole skit needs to be shortened.
More background stage move

ment by the chorus would also
help.
The second-act opener is lively
and fun—the Chappie's jokes
never have had it so good. The
stage «et for this number is
especially good; designer Judy
Patt's work is colorful and ef
fective throughout most of the
show.
Kerri Wolfstone does an excel
lent job with her two songs in
the night-club number. Another
soloist, I'at Held fond, is also
good.
Tim Laddish gives a fine per
formance as the master of cere
monies who strings all the num
bers together. His patter concern
ing a book is especially funny,
but he is hampered at times with
less well-written material.
The overture to the first act is
inappropriate for "Big Game
Gaieties." While loud enough, the
music doesn't have the impact,
jazziness or complete gaiety with
which such a show should begin.
The pre-finale is unfortunately
ineffective with lyrics which
never reach the audience —a fault
which o c curs too frequently
throughout the produclon.
The product on ends on an "Op
timistic Outlook" with the words
"the Stanford Axe is coming
back" —an appropriate finale for
the show which is entirely cen
tered around campus concerns.
