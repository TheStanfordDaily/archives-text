# Self-Portrait Spoof Highlights Gaieties

### EMMY LOU BUCHANAN Drama Critic 
I was 10 years old when I saw my first show and until Tuesday
night il was my only theater experience. But I broke down and went
to "Gaieties" and even stayed for the second act. Fortunately.
The last half (if the two-and-a-half-hour show makes the first half
worth sitting through. And even the first part is worth the price

Parodies of such untouchable

the hashers, in the first half of
the show, when the audience sees
them as they are sure to be seen

Ent i 11 ed "Sunny Side. Funny
Side Up," the song-skit is humor
ous and well done.
The Daily parody is . . . well, a
parody. Ram's Head evidently en
listed fifth column forces for this
one but fails to take full ad
vantage of the material in the
Shack. Although it scores at
times, the satirical skit treads too
lightly.
THE TWO BiG dance numbers
are imaginative and well done.
Choreographer M a rgot Jones
uses the bookstore setting as a
fine excuse for six brief, inter-
