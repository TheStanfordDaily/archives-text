# Cal Card Sharks Take Card Cards
## 
### 
Despite hopes for a clean sweep
by the Cards during this year's
Big Game Week, Stanford's
bridge team failed to conquer
California in a match to deter
mine the s up r e m ac y among
Northern California schools.
The eight stalwarts attempting
to uphold Stanford's reputation
in this encounter were Bill Gold
man, Dave Hall, Karlis Veidins,
Mark Garman, Doug Rippete, Bob
McNeill, Jack Mayer, and A 1 De-
Fraga.
The match was played by teams
of four, in which a hand is played
by both halves of the team and
the score compared. Scoring was
by International Match Points:
one IMP is worth roughly 100
total points. The first team lost
its match by 23 IMP's and the
second team lost by five IMP's.
Assisting Cal in its victory was
Peter Rank, a Stanford alumnus
and a member of last year's Stan
ford team.
