# Bulletin Honors Woman Editor
## 
### 
A beloved editor is memorial
ized in the latest issue of the
Stanford Ichthyological Bulletin,
a professional journal published
by Stanford's Museum of Natural
History.
The Margaret Hamilton Storey
Memorial Issue was the last Bul
letin on which she worked with
her co-editor, Professor George
S. Myers. Miss Storey also was
assistant curator of zoological
collections in the Museum, where
she had served for 25 years.
"It is impossible to evaluate or
even to estimate Margaret Stor
ey's dedicated services to the Mu
seum," reads the preface by Pro
fessor Myers.
"She not only acted as curator,
but also as librarian, editor, coun
selor, and helpful assistant to
everybody-â€”faculty, graduate stu
dents, and visiting investigators
alike. She constantly sacrificed
her own interests for others."
