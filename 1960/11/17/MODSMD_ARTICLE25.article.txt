# Cal's Imitation Hoover Tower Used as Odds 'n Ends Catchall
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
To Stanfordites, Cal's Campanile is the skinny symbol of Stan
ford's biggest rival and the target for "Beat Cal" banners. But the
Campanile does serve other purposes. Its practical use to Cal stu
dents is to tell what time it is a function it doesn't always perform,
for despite the tower's 307 feet, it can't be seen from many parts
of Berkeley's hilly campus.
The Campanile, officially known as the Sal her Tower, was
built in 1914 by Mrs. Jane K. Sat her in memory of her husband and
modeled after St. Mark's campanile in Venice.
The chimes, with a range of one-and-one-half octaves, are played
at noon and open and close the university day as well as striking
the hour. The 12 bells weigh from 349 pounds to 2 tons each and were

cast in England and shipped
across the Atlantic during World
War I.
THE HEIGHT of the Campa
nile, which some have said in
creases with each succeeding Cal
publication, is currently quoted
by a Cal public relations official
as 307 feet, the third largest bell
tower in the world. One story has
it that the tower was originally
planned to be 300 l'ect but was
increased by a foot when the
architect learned that a school
back East had a tower that high.
The walls of the Campanile,
granite stones held by cement to
the steel structure, have always
been a big problem. The walls
first began cracking in 1927. By
1949 granite stones were falling
at such a rapid rate that the
State Legislature voted SIo.OOO
for repairs.
A few years ago the stones
was closed for repairs. The area
directly under the treacherous
granite facing was made into a
flower plot and blocked off by
a cement border.
TOWER SPACE is used for
storage of various odd items, in
cluding the bones from anthro
pological expeditions. Visitors
going up the tower are often
amused by displays of skulls at
the doors leading to the elevator
shaft.
Two days before Big Game last
year the Campanile was decked
with a shaming 100-foot-long
sign saying "Beat Cal" in bright
red letters. The already legendary
deed- was carried out by a band
of Stanfordites calling themselves
"The Immoral 12."
Apparently even Cal students
like to use their bell tower for
practical jokes. In old days they
would hang a horse buggy from
the Campanile. In recent years a
rabbit was found on the tower's
well-lighted pinnacle at Easter.

The chimes, with a range of one-and-one-half octaves, are played
at noon and open and close the university day as well as striking
the hour. The 12 bells weigh from 349 pounds to 2 tons each and were

cast in England and shipped
across the Atlantic during World
War I.
THE HEIGHT of the Campa
nile, which some have said in
creases with each succeeding Cal
publication, is currently quoted
by a Cal public relations official
as 307 feet, the third largest bell
tower in the world. One story has
it that the tower was originally
planned to be 300 l'ect but was
increased by a foot when the
architect learned that a school
back East had a tower that high.
The walls of the Campanile,
granite stones held by cement to
the steel structure, have always
been a big problem. The walls
first began cracking in 1927. By
1949 granite stones were falling
at such a rapid rate that the
State Legislature voted SIo.OOO
for repairs.
A few years ago the stones
was closed for repairs. The area
directly under the treacherous
granite facing was made into a
flower plot and blocked off by
a cement border.
TOWER SPACE is used for
storage of various odd items, in
cluding the bones from anthro
pological expeditions. Visitors
going up the tower are often
amused by displays of skulls at
the doors leading to the elevator
shaft.
Two days before Big Game last
year the Campanile was decked
with a shaming 100-foot-long
sign saying "Beat Cal" in bright
red letters. The already legendary
deed- was carried out by a band
of Stanfordites calling themselves
"The Immoral 12."
Apparently even Cal students
like to use their bell tower for
practical jokes. In old days they
would hang a horse buggy from
the Campanile. In recent years a
rabbit was found on the tower's
well-lighted pinnacle at Easter.
To Stanfordites, Cal's Campanile is the skinny symbol of Stan
ford's biggest rival and the target for "Beat Cal" banners. But the
Campanile does serve other purposes. Its practical use to Cal stu
dents is to tell what time it is a function it doesn't always perform,
for despite the tower's 307 feet, it can't be seen from many parts
of Berkeley's hilly campus.
The Campanile, officially known as the Sal her Tower, was
built in 1914 by Mrs. Jane K. Sat her in memory of her husband and
modeled after St. Mark's campanile in Venice.
