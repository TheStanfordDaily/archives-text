# Grants Awarded For Asian Study
## 
### 
How do Asian nations use edu
cation as a means of achieving
their national goals?
The answer to this question is
the subject of a long-range study
launched this fall by Stanford
University's School of Education.
Already in Formosa to study
the Chiang Kai-shek govern
ment's educational processes is
Donald M. Foster, Stanford grad
uate student working toward his
doctorate in education. His re
search will stress economics and
personnel training.
Foster, a former assistant pro
fessor of education at San Jose
State College, earned his bache
lor's degree there and his mas
ter's degree at Southern Oregon
College, Ashland.
Guiding his research is Dr. Paul
R. Hanna, Lee Jacks professor of
child education at Stanford Uni
versity, and director of the re
sea reh project which is support
ed by a $46,800 grant from the
U.S. Office of Education.
Three additional graduate stu
dents will be sent to other Asian
nations later in the year to study
education as it relates to national
policy.
