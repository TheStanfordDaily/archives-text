# Cuba a Global Questionâ€”Baran
##

BY SONYA MICHEL
"The fate of the Cuban revolu
tion is not being decided in
Cuba," Paul Baran told an over
flow audience in Cubberley last
night.
"It is being decided in an inter
national arena, in a global strife
between capitalism and social
ism," continued Baran, economics
professor here and Cuban spe
cialist.
THE MOST important ques
tions in Cuban development arc
"strictly diseases of childhood,
not having enough experience,
not learning how to do things."
"It took capitalism 150 years of
learning by mistakes to do
things," he added.
He disagreed with the" Cuban
economist who said "It will put
the Cuban government on its
knees."
BARAN pointed out that the
embargoes as such will have no
effect on the economy for a year
or two.
"Whether or not the Soviet
Union . . . can do much or little,
they can certainly do enough to
maintain 6 1 - million people," he
maintained.
As for ihe question of military
intervention, Baran warned: "I
don't want to engage in 'Drew
Pearson-ism' and be an arch
strategist." . . . but intervention
that might have succeeded in
Guatemala, because of a turn
coat army "wouldn't work in
Cuba, because there is no organ
ized army."
