What began as the calm second annual Phi Beta Kappa seminar
on education last night blossomed into one of the hottest debates to
shake Stanford academic circles this year. Attended by (5N members
of this scholastic body, as well as several non-affiliated observers,
the symposium stated its topic as "The Goals of Public Education
in America."
The group featured as panelists past head of the Stanford Board
of Trustees David Packard, Professor Virgil K. VV hi taker, head of
Hie Stanford English Department, and recently elected junior Phi
Bete member Michael R. Gordon.
Rounding out the group was California Teacher's Associa
tion officer Kenneth Brown, who soon became the center of a foray
of educational philosophies and clashes of University prof versus
public teacher.
IT W AS AT this point that Brown, representing !()2,IK)() California
teachers, launched into a commentary of over twenty minutes filtra
tion. "The Stanford Report was done with questionable thorough
ness." he began. "None of the men writing it had any experience
teaching in public schools; they didn't have the background to tell
the San Francisco school board how to teach reading; in the first
grade."
"They didn't make recommendations; they made positive state
ments. It seems to us ii would base been professionally more diplo
matic for the professors to ask for a consultant who actually knew
the field.'
At this point, audience member Dr. William Barker broke in with
"Am 1 mistaken is this a panel discussion or a lecture?" Barker
was one ol the eight authors of the Stanford Report on the schools.
The audience replied with hearty applause.
Slated Professor Whitaker, "The Stanford Report was a frank,
vigorous statement ot views held b\ signed people.
The hotly contested issues of the evening was resolved by a
mediating YVhilaker as he commented. "I'm sure we'll all agree that
whether or not the public schools are fulfilling their goals com
pletely, the\ should accept with an open mind the belief that the
school should work to improve."
