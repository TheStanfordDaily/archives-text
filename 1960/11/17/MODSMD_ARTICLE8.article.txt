# Pre-Big Game Pranksters Squeak into Roble Hall
## 
### 
E
Speculator! has it that Big Game rivalry is off with a squeaking
start on Cal's behalf as our Berkeley neighbors are credited with
the appearance of 100 to 150 small white mice in Roble last night.
As freshman girls converged upon 3-B and 3-Center corridors
after dinner, they discovered the floor covered with the long-tailed

squeakers. Both groups mice
and girls broke about even in
who could make the most noise
about the presence of whom.
THK 3IICK pink-eyed baby
variety were obviously original
ly planned for experimental work
as evidenced by the presence of
quantities of blue dye on their
coats, unless of course the sig
nificance of the dye could lie asso
ciated with a certain local univer
sity.
The mice arrived less than a
day after Stanford woke up to
find the tan sandstone of the
Farm violated by the addition of
primitive artistic endeavors. The
pillars of Palm Drive now sport
the inscription, "Cal Beats Stan
ford." The blue squiggles are con
cluded with the autograph of an
anonymous "Gary" inscribed on
the side w a 1 k around Hoover
Tower.
11 is believed that these weak
efforts were inspired by a desire
to "get even" on the part of these
anonymous Cal sympathizers for
the grand Big Game move of the
year enacted by overseas Indians
a few weeks ago.
