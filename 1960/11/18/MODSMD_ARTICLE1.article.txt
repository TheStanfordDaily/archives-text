# Cards Upset Cal for First Big Game Victory in 1892
## 
### JEAN EBERHART 
Stanford got off to a good start in the Big Game tradi
tion by upsetting the favored Cal team 14-10 in the first
game of the series on March 19, 1892. The scene of this
first triumph was Haight Street Park in San Francisco.
The first Big Game was not tlie first feud with Cal.
Dissension began between the two schools when Senator
and Mrs. Stanford conceived the idea of a new university.
Berkeley was against the plan from the start with the com
ment. "There is no need or room for two universities in
our state."
HOWEVER, IN SPITE of protests from Cal, Stanford
was founded, and it wasn't long until the new school had
its first football team. Arthur H. Barnhisel, a member of
that Stanford football team, described the preparations for
the first Big Game in a special report for the Daily several
years ago.
"Arrangements . . . were made by student leaders who
knew San Francisco and Berkeley men. I remember dis
tinctly when word was passed around that plans for a
game with California were being worked out.
"I don't know that any written challenge was issued or
accepted. California being the long-standing and acknowl

edged 'champion' could not be expected to recognize an
outfit of bush leaguers.
"STANFORD initiated the 'approach' according to the
intent and spirit of the team as the players began to de
velop confidence and feel their oats. Word then passed
around that Berkeley had accepted.
"Berkeley was painting the towns and San Francisco
with headlines in newspapers urging the whole Bay popu
lation to show up on Haight Street Ball Field and watch
the 'Berkeley Baby Elephants make doormats of Stanford
Rustic.' Stanford said little, but spent long hours practicing
two secret plays."
The day of the game was a gay one in San Francisco;
the city was decorated with red, blue and gold, and stu
dents in rented coaches paraded up and down Market
Street. Waving flags, blowing tin horns, and ringing bells,
the students from the two institutions converged on their
respective headquarters.
STANFORDITES, wearing red on their hats and
sleeves, met at Lick House. The Cal rallying-ground was
the Palace Hotel. There the Berkeley mod students shouted
the first cheer of the day:

"Rah • Rah - Rail
Skeltetonia
U.C.M.D.
Hip bone ah."
The odds were three (o four before the game for a Cal
victory. Stanford being a newer and smaller school was
at a disadvantage. In fact, the U.C.'s even dubbed the
Stanford men "kidlets."
Seven thousand people jammed the stands at Haight
Park to see this great game; two thousand more had to
be content to hear the cheers from outside.
CAL BACKERS outnumbered the Stanford rooters five
to one, and, needless to say, the Cal yells drowned out
Stanford. If yells could win a game, Cal would have been
victorious; but the Card football team did a good job, and
the first Big Game win was chalked up to Stanford.
After the game San Francisco's cable cars were over
flowing with celebrating Stanfordites. Students packed
the Bush Street Theater and disrupted the performance
by waving flags, blowing whistles, and making remarks
about the actors.
Ready for a blast in the city, some Stanford men asked
at Norman's for an upper room for a beer party. The

rather staid saloon-keeper said they couldn't have the
room, so the mob went on down Kearney Street.
AT SUTTER, THEY met an old-time fellow collegian
who was in a good mood and offered to buy drinks for
the whole crowd.
At the nearest bar, Stanford cheers nearly raised the
roof.
"Ha. ha, ha!
Wah, wah, wah!
U.C. Berkeley, ha, ha, ha!"
At one point during the celebration, the tired, battered,
and bruised Berkeley team dared to attempt a defiant
hanging of a blue and gold banner on one side of the room.
Stanford shouts greeted the defeated team's effort, "Go
home to your mammas," and "Wah, ho, wall! Stanford!
Stanford!
THE CELEBRANTS wrapped up the evening's good
times by chanting:
"They never smiled again,
They never smiled again,
They never, never, never,
Never smiled again."
That was the first Big Game—the game that has de
veloped into one of the most intense rivalries between any
two universities in the country.
