# INDIANS OUT FOR REVENGE
## Stanford Faces Cal Soccermen in ‘Big Boot’ 
### GLENN ALFORD 
STANFORD'S soccer team will
be out for revenge tomorrow in
the "Big Boot' against California.
The soccer match will take place
on the Strawberry Canyon soccer
field at 10:30, having been trans
ferred from Memorial Stadium
because rains have made the sta
dium soggy, and California of
ficials don't want to ruin the
field for the football games.
Stanford will be out to get
California on two counts. First,
Stanford has lost three of the
last four soccer games against
California, and second, Stanford
was passed over as a possible
participant in the NCAA playoffs
in favor of Cal.
STANFORD Coach Fred Prid
dle voted for Stanford, but the
other two NCAA representatives
in the West voted for California,
leaving Stanford out in the cold.
California has a strong team,
but Stanford aficionados may be
pardoned for thinking their team
is better. Both squads have lost
but one game. Stanford to CCSF,
and Cal to USF. Both teams have
beaten the team that the other
has lost to.
California has the higher scor
ing average but this stems from
the fact that Stanford Coach Prid
dle is much quicker to put in his
reserves than Cal's Coach Bob
DiGrazia. California's higher goal
average was the main reason that
it was chosen over Stanford.
THERE IS one main reason for
Stanford's feeling that it is the
better representative for the
playoffs.. Cal's goalie, All-Amer
ican Fred Becker, will be ineligi
ble to compete in the playoffs

since he is a senior and in his
fourth year of college playing.
Soccer players in their fourth
year of eligibility are barred
from competing in NCAA spon
sored playoff matches. His ab
sence will materially weaken
Cal's defense.
With Becker gone California's
only weakness is at the goal. Else
where they are sound.
Centerhalf is the strong posi
tion in the California backfield.
Roland Prydz, an All-Conference
selection last year mans that po
sition. Of added interest is a re
serve Cal fullback from Rio de
Janiero named Igor Mousasti
coshvily.
CALIFORNIA has plenty of
offense. The key to the Cal attack
is a Norwegian inside, Arne
Braathen. He feeds the more pub
licized scorers and occasionally
finds time to plunk a ball in the
net himself. The leading scorers
are Jahan Fouladi, Bill Barreda
and Oleg 'Reoutt.
Cal has been hampered by in
juries received last week. Prydz.
Reoutt, Fouladi and, last but not
least, Mousasticoshvily all will
play at partial speed due to leg
injuries.
Stanford is in top shape at all
but the vital center-half position
where All-League candidate Jan
Achenbach will be out of action.
Ed Berner will replace him in the
starting lineup and will be backed
up by Allison Gibbs.
Fullback will be played by Dan
Farthing and Dick Voake. Voake
played the finest game of his
fullback career last week and is
ready for the big effort that will
be needed to beat Cal. Farthing
always plays well, although he

hit his peak early in the year,
against USF. He is a candidate
for All-Conference honors.
AT HALFBACK, Bernie
Knaggs is the West Coast Soccer
Conference's outstanding candi
date for Ail-American honors.
Aside from being a top defensive
back he usually finds time to
score at least one goal every
game. Knaggs is the team captain
and penalty shooter.
At the other halfback positions
are Rusty Williams and Berner.
Berner saw his first varsity ac
tion of the season last week, and
acquitted himself well. Williams
is the most tenacious halfback
anywhere. He sticks to his man
like glue until the 1 opponent loses
the ball or gets rid of it hastily.
On the offense, Emmanuel
Andah is the big story. The com
pact sprinting center-half is one
of the highest scorers in the
league, and in the nation. He is
quick as a cat and when he
doesn't have the ball he drives
opposing defenses crazy trying
to follow him as he runs all over
the field. Opponents usually put
one or two defenders on him,
which frees other of Stanford's
fine forwards to receive the ball
and try to score.
ADAM BIANCHI and Mike
Tippett, wings, are the two most
underrated players in the league.
Bianchi does everything well and
is the man who makes the big
play, as he did against USF. mak
ing the winning goal. Tippett has
been a consistent scorer although
lately hampered by a leg injury.
THE INS IDES, Rune Enge
brettsen and Dick Bartlett, pri
marily are playmakers. Engo
brettsen leads the team in as
sists; Bartlett came through with
the clutch goal that sent the Cal
Aggies down to defeat.
Goalie Beau Bianchi hasn't had
to work much because the Indian
defense has kept opponents away
from the net, but in the last two
weeks he has been one of the
shining lights for Stanford. He
often turned back Aggie attacks
last week and held high-scoring
USF scoreless.
STANFORD is out to prove
that they should have been sent
to the NCAA playoffs and they
want to win and win convinc
ingly. Stranger things have hap
pened on "Big Game" day than a
good team winning.
