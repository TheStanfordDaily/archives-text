## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (UPI) President Eisenhower yesterday ordered
U.S. warships and planes to protect Guatemala and Nicaragua
against any "Communist directed" invasion launched from Cuba.
Both Central American republics accused Cubaii Premier Fidel
Castro of aiding unsuccessful rebel attempts this week to topple

th e i r respective governments.
Manuel Orellana, a major force
in Guatemalan political affairs,
said he and his supporters would
call for a declaration of war if it
can be proved that Castro was
behind the rebellion.
EISENHOWER'S a n no u nce
ment, reminiscent of his historic
order of Aug. 25, 1958 directing
ships of the U.S. Seventh Fleet
to sail into the Formosa Straits

to defend Formosa and the Pes
cadores, pointed up the serious
ness with which the White House
regards the situation.
The Navy disclosed shortly
after the president's announce
ment that the big aircraft car
rier Shangrila and four destroy
ers were patroling an area off
the southern tip of Cuba. A fifth
destroyer, the K. D. Bailey, was
reported refueling at Panama and
was assigned to patrol along the
East Coast. The four destroyers
with the Shangrila all are
equipped for radar picket duty.
They are the Fisk, Hawkins, W.
R. Rush and M. C. Fox.
IN ADDITION the Navy re
ported two P2V patrol planes,
based in Panama, would keep an
aerial surveillance. The Shangrila
normally carries 70 aircraft.
Eisenhower i-ssued his carefully
worded announcement after dis
cussing the crisis with Secretary
of State Christian A. Herter, De
fense Secretary Thomas S. Gates
Jr. and Chairman Lyman L. Lem
nitzer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
at his vacation headquarters here.
THK WHITE House said that
the subject did not come up at
an earlier two-hour session of the
top-level National Security Coun
cil attended by the diplomatic and
military leaders.
James C. Hagerty. press sec
retary to the president, issued the
following statement on Eisen
hower's action:
"In response to the requests of
the governments of Guatemala
and Nicaragua, surface and air
units of the U.S. Navy are in a
position in which they could as
sist these governments, should it
become necessary, to seek out
and prevent intervention on the
part of Communist-directed ele
ments in the internal affairs of
Guatemala through the landing
of aimed forces or supplies from
abroad."
