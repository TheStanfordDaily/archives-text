# ‘Stupendous’ Stunts Belittle Big Game Rival
## 
### KATHEE DOWNING 
Rich Garlinghouse, card stunts
chairman, and his three Rally
Com masterminds huddled around
the penciled plans for Big Game
card stunts.
Thrusting his furry chin out
of the huddle, Garlinghouse said,
"We design these card stunts with

the idea that intelligence of the
rooters on the other side of the
field is no higher than that of a
12-year-old.
"The card stunts are designed
for simplicity," explained Garling
house, "and include a safety fac
tor, the Z variable. This Z vari
able allows any one section of
students to flip all the wrong
cards and still not louse up the
whole stunt."
GARLINGHOUSE said the de
signs are plotted by the four-man
coalition. "Then the masses, all
the cynical, ex-Republican mem
bers of the committee, mark
numbers in the little squares and
stamp cue cards and hope the
whole mess works out," he said.
"Of course we always work by
candlelight," he added, "but, in
spite of these minor technical
problems, Big Game card stunts
will be stupendous.
"TIIE STUNTS are oriented to
Stanford's obvious superiority
over Cal." explained Garling
liou.se. "We open with a big 'Stan
ford vs. Cal,' then flip to the typi
cal Stanford man with a big S on
his sweater. His opposite at Cal
is represented by a mass of num
bers.
"Stunt 3 ranks Stanford wo
men," he continued, "as smarter
than Cal girls. Next, the towers
of the two campuses are pictured.
Another flip shows the Leaning
Tower of Pisa Stanford has
more towers than Cal," he ex
plained.
