# Legislature Endorses Idea of ‘Peace Corps’
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Legislature by a 12-7 vote last
night endorsed the Peace Corps
idea and urged "that this idea be
implemented by an act of Con
gress ut an early date."
After 50 minutes of debate in
which LASSU amended the mo
tion twice and killed three other
amendments, the following reso
lution won the 12-7 approval:
"Resolved: That the Legislature
endorses a proposal whereby
qualified young men and women
can serve their country in a ci
vilian corps to aid in the develop
ment of underdeveloped coun
tries. We urge that this idea be
implemented by an act of Con
gress at an early date.
"BE IT further resolved that:
The Institute of International Re
lations, the Political Union, and
the Stanford Daily be given the
responsibility for campus educa
tion concerning the 'Peace Corps'
idea and that they be authorized
to circulate petitions and organ
ize letter-writing campaigns with
the understanding that, they are
to provide for dissident opinion."
Before acting on this measure.
LASSU first voted down without

opposition last week's resolution
which would have had it "endorse
in the principle" President-elect
Kennedy's version of the Peace
Corps.
Debate then opened up on the
lIR-sponsored resolution.
Off-campus representative Tom
Reilly said he had polled about 20
students and found them gener
ally in favor of the idea, but want
ing more discussion on the matter
before a LASSU move.
UNION rep Nan Sherwood
noted that she had sounded her
constituents' feelings and found
them "about 100 per cent" for
LASSU's taking a stand for the
Peace Corps idea.
She said a precedent had been
set before in LASSU's acting on
off-campus issues, and declared
she felt LASSU members would
be "letting our constituents down
if we don't take a stand."
Reilly then introduced a motion
that would have deleted "en
dorses" from the resolution and
inserted in its place that LASSU
"realizes the need for discussion
of" the plan.
THIS amendment was beaten
down 9 against, 7 for.

lIR-sponsored resolution.
Off-campus representative Tom
Reilly said he had polled about 20
students and found them gener
ally in favor of the idea, but want
ing more discussion on the matter
before a LASSU move.
UNION rep Nan Sherwood
noted that she had sounded her
constituents' feelings and found
them "about 100 per cent" for
LASSU's taking a stand for the
Peace Corps idea.
She said a precedent had been
set before in LASSU's acting on
off-campus issues, and declared
she felt LASSU members would
be "letting our constituents down
if we don't take a stand."
Reilly then introduced a motion
that would have deleted "en
dorses" from the resolution and
inserted in its place that LASSU
"realizes the need for discussion
of" the plan.
THIS amendment was beaten
down 9 against, 7 for.
Legislature by a 12-7 vote last
night endorsed the Peace Corps
idea and urged "that this idea be
implemented by an act of Con
gress ut an early date."
After 50 minutes of debate in
which LASSU amended the mo
tion twice and killed three other
amendments, the following reso
lution won the 12-7 approval:
"Resolved: That the Legislature
endorses a proposal whereby
qualified young men and women
can serve their country in a ci
vilian corps to aid in the develop
ment of underdeveloped coun
tries. We urge that this idea be
implemented by an act of Con
gress at an early date.
"BE IT further resolved that:
The Institute of International Re
lations, the Political Union, and
the Stanford Daily be given the
responsibility for campus educa
tion concerning the 'Peace Corps'
idea and that they be authorized
to circulate petitions and organ
ize letter-writing campaigns with
the understanding that, they are
to provide for dissident opinion."
Before acting on this measure.
LASSU first voted down without

opposition last week's resolution
which would have had it "endorse
in the principle" President-elect
Kennedy's version of the Peace
Corps.
Debate then opened up on the
