# Blade Abducted from Cal Early Yesterday
## 
### 
The Stanford A.xe is missing! After leading an uneventful life
for the last four years, the legendary blade disappeared from its
resting place at Cal sometime between 5:15 p.m. Wednesday and
8:15 a.m. yesterday. As the Daily went to press, its whereabouts
were still unknown and its abductors, still anonymous.

THE LAST limp the Axe was
known to be seen on the Cal cam
pus was at 5:15 p.m. Wednesday
when it was put into a 500-pound,
6-foot high steel safe on the sec
ond floor of Stephens Union in
the Associated Students of the
University of California activi
ties' office.
At 8:15 yesterday morning the
i safe was opened and the Axe
| was gone. The safe also held $70
in cash which was found undis
turbed.
The safe had not been broken
into but opened evidently by its
combination.
AN ASUC official said yester
day morning that an immediate
security check of all professional
ASUC staff members was being
undertaken "to see if any are
Stanford graduates." However, a
secretary in the Associated Stu
dents' office said that "250 people
know the combination to the
safe" and that "a dime store safe
j would be harder to open."
Lieut. Merrill Chandler of the
| UC Police Department said that
! while no new leads had turned
up, "the way it was perpetrated
leads us to believe it was some-
I one who knew the workings of
I the ASUC." He suggested that
i it could have been the work of
a spirit-booster.
(HANDLER said that there
: were no marks on the safe and
i that no doors or windows had
I been jimmied, making the abduc
j tion "look like an inside job." No
J fingerprints were found since
; "they weren't careful in opening
| the safe in the morning, having
no idea that the theft had taken
place."
The only clue to the disappear
ance came at 5 p.m. when the
ASCU office received a call from
"the Fearsome Five" saying the
Axe was in their possession. The
office said it had no* idea whether
the group belonged to Stanford
or Cal or if the group even
existed.
Between 2 and 3 p.m. yesterday
a rumor began spreading that the
Axe had been in the American
Trust Co. vault in Berkeley and
still was. A phone call to the
Trust Co. established the fact
that no such object had been
taken from the vault. In fact, no
such object had been in the vault
for 30 years, the operations man
ager of the branch said.
LEE STEPHENSON, Stanford
Axe Day chairman, said that the
"general consensus on the Stan
ford campus was that it was done
by Cal. It would almost have to
be an inside job," he said, but
added that "if someone from
Stanford University has it, it will
show up at Big Game."
The managing editor of the
Daily Californian didn't leave
Stanford out of the picture,
however, saying that "it wouldn't
be difficult for someone to get
the combination as copies of it
were at the ASUC office."
Before this, the last episode of
Ihe Axe occurred in 1956 when
the mounted blade was taken
from the supposedly burglar
proof case in the Stanford Cellar
on June 13 by use of a blowtorch
and cold water.
THAT TIME it was discovered
on Oct. 27, before the SC game,
lying on the seat of football co
captain John Brodie's car which
was parked in front of the Presi
dent Hotel in Palo Alto. A note
was attached which said "From
ihe unknown."
If Indians have the Axe now,
it is suspected that it will appear
at tonight's rally or at the game
tomorrow. If Cal has it. Big Game
will probably be the first time it
comes to light.
