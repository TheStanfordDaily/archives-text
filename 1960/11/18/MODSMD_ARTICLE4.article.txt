# Frosh Plant Steel ‘S’ At Berkeley
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Stanford and Cal students yes
! terday raided each other's cam
j puses in one of llic wildest days
! in Big Game history.
While the highlight of the day
! was the disappearance of the Axe.
intrepid Indians and Bears also
used an airplane, 800 pounds of
lime and dump trucks to pull off
a series of stunts.
MAIN STANFORD COUP was
I the planting of a 29-foot, bright
! red steel S on the hillside above
! Cal's football stadium. The new
! addition to the Berkeley campus
j should be visible for all to see to-
J morrow, unless Cal somehow
manages to remove the S. This
probably will require dynamite,
since the letter is made of welded
steel and is anchored to the Cal
turf with concrete, strengthened
by iron rods.
A group of about 15 freshmen
from Rineonada House, Wilbur
Hall, turned the neat trick right
under the noses of Cal students,
who apparently saw nothing un
usual when a couple of trucks
pulled up on the hillside and a
I number of "workmen" piled out
] and went to work.
What the poor Bears didn't re-j
ali/.e was that the "workmen"
were the Wilbur men dressed in
work clothes and led by a bona
fide construction foreman, bor
rowed for the occasion by one of
the frosh from his father's con
crete company.
THE FROSH also were using
equipment on loan from the
friendly father. They arrived at
Cal around 2:30 and put the big
S together by sections, complet
ing their task by 6:30. Presum
ably, Cal students won't know
about the stunt until they gaze
up at their newly decorated hill
side this morning.
As the Cards were on their way
to Cal, the school across the Bay
got in its best blow of the week !
when a single-engine light plane
flew back and forth across the;
campus, dumping leaflets titled
"Indians Give Up."
THE PLANE, trailing a blue
and gold banner, first appeared j
over Stanford skies at 12:55 p.m.,!
flying low and dropping leaflets, j
The plane, which was traced to

a rental agency at the Oakland
airport, made four swings across
the campus before flying back
towards Cal.
The whole series of pranks be
gan late Wednesday night when i
a group of 14 Stanford men jour- ■
neyed up to South San Francisco!
and planted a monstrous "Beat ■
Cal" slogan on one of the hills j
which face Bayshore Freeway in !
the South S.F. area.
WHERE BEFORE there was
nothing but hard, bare California
soil, a 40-foot lime message call
ing for Stanford to "Beat Cal"
now appears.
The group who pulled that j
stunt off used 400 pounds of lime
to make the letters and were;
shielded by a fog which conven
iently rolled in as they began to
work before midnight.
After that ,iob was finished,
seven freshmen and sophomores
continued to Berkeley and im
printed a 35-foot high S in the
hillside above the new Cal dor
mitories.
Like the Bayshore lettering, the
S was done with 400 pounds of,
lime and was six yards wide.
TIIE ONES who accomplished
that feat had to wait until 1 a.m.
when the guard in the area was

changed. It look thorn just 15
minutes to do their work and
mako an escape.
To make sure all went well,
they had "staked out" the area
earlier in the day and actually
had made three "dry runs."
And finally, The Daily nearly
became the victim of a Cal "joke"
early yesterday morning.
A group of college-age males
appeared about 2:30 a.m. in the
building behind the Daily Shack
where the paper is printed as the
presses were turning out the
Thursday Daily.
THE INTRUDERS, who had
blackened their faces and may
have been Cal students who
scrawled blue "Cal" messages on
several buildings and sidewalks
around campus Wednesday eve
ning or yesterday morning, hesi
tated, wondering what they could
do to foul up The Daily.
They quickly decided to do
nothing when one Daily press
man advanced on them wielding
a foot-long knife kept in the
building and told them to leave.
They did, while the other press
man was calling Stanford police.
What next?

used an airplane, 800 pounds of
lime and dump trucks to pull off
a series of stunts.
MAIN STANFORD COUP was
I the planting of a 29-foot, bright
! red steel S on the hillside above
! Cal's football stadium. The new
! addition to the Berkeley campus
j should be visible for all to see to-
J morrow, unless Cal somehow
manages to remove the S. This
probably will require dynamite,
since the letter is made of welded
steel and is anchored to the Cal
turf with concrete, strengthened
by iron rods.
A group of about 15 freshmen
from Rineonada House, Wilbur
Hall, turned the neat trick right
under the noses of Cal students,
who apparently saw nothing un
usual when a couple of trucks
pulled up on the hillside and a
I number of "workmen" piled out
] and went to work.
What the poor Bears didn't re-j
ali/.e was that the "workmen"
were the Wilbur men dressed in
work clothes and led by a bona
fide construction foreman, bor
rowed for the occasion by one of
the frosh from his father's con
crete company.
THE FROSH also were using
equipment on loan from the
friendly father. They arrived at
Cal around 2:30 and put the big
S together by sections, complet
ing their task by 6:30. Presum
ably, Cal students won't know
about the stunt until they gaze
up at their newly decorated hill
side this morning.
As the Cards were on their way
to Cal, the school across the Bay
got in its best blow of the week !
when a single-engine light plane
flew back and forth across the;
campus, dumping leaflets titled
"Indians Give Up."
THE PLANE, trailing a blue
and gold banner, first appeared j
over Stanford skies at 12:55 p.m.,!
flying low and dropping leaflets, j
The plane, which was traced to

a rental agency at the Oakland
airport, made four swings across
the campus before flying back
towards Cal.
The whole series of pranks be
gan late Wednesday night when i
a group of 14 Stanford men jour- ■
neyed up to South San Francisco!
and planted a monstrous "Beat ■
Cal" slogan on one of the hills j
which face Bayshore Freeway in !
the South S.F. area.
WHERE BEFORE there was
nothing but hard, bare California
soil, a 40-foot lime message call
ing for Stanford to "Beat Cal"
now appears.
The group who pulled that j
stunt off used 400 pounds of lime
to make the letters and were;
shielded by a fog which conven
iently rolled in as they began to
work before midnight.
After that ,iob was finished,
seven freshmen and sophomores
continued to Berkeley and im
printed a 35-foot high S in the
hillside above the new Cal dor
mitories.
Like the Bayshore lettering, the
S was done with 400 pounds of,
lime and was six yards wide.
TIIE ONES who accomplished
that feat had to wait until 1 a.m.
when the guard in the area was

changed. It look thorn just 15
minutes to do their work and
mako an escape.
To make sure all went well,
they had "staked out" the area
earlier in the day and actually
had made three "dry runs."
And finally, The Daily nearly
became the victim of a Cal "joke"
early yesterday morning.
A group of college-age males
appeared about 2:30 a.m. in the
building behind the Daily Shack
where the paper is printed as the
presses were turning out the
Thursday Daily.
THE INTRUDERS, who had
blackened their faces and may
have been Cal students who
scrawled blue "Cal" messages on
several buildings and sidewalks
around campus Wednesday eve
ning or yesterday morning, hesi
tated, wondering what they could
do to foul up The Daily.
They quickly decided to do
nothing when one Daily press
man advanced on them wielding
a foot-long knife kept in the
building and told them to leave.
They did, while the other press
man was calling Stanford police.

! addition to the Berkeley campus
j should be visible for all to see to-
J morrow, unless Cal somehow
manages to remove the S. This
probably will require dynamite,
since the letter is made of welded
steel and is anchored to the Cal
turf with concrete, strengthened
by iron rods.
A group of about 15 freshmen
from Rineonada House, Wilbur
Hall, turned the neat trick right
under the noses of Cal students,
who apparently saw nothing un
usual when a couple of trucks
pulled up on the hillside and a
I number of "workmen" piled out
] and went to work.
What the poor Bears didn't re-j
ali/.e was that the "workmen"
were the Wilbur men dressed in
work clothes and led by a bona
fide construction foreman, bor
rowed for the occasion by one of
the frosh from his father's con
crete company.
THE FROSH also were using
equipment on loan from the
friendly father. They arrived at
Cal around 2:30 and put the big
S together by sections, complet
ing their task by 6:30. Presum
ably, Cal students won't know
about the stunt until they gaze
up at their newly decorated hill
side this morning.
As the Cards were on their way
to Cal, the school across the Bay
got in its best blow of the week !
when a single-engine light plane
flew back and forth across the;
campus, dumping leaflets titled
"Indians Give Up."
THE PLANE, trailing a blue
and gold banner, first appeared j
over Stanford skies at 12:55 p.m.,!
flying low and dropping leaflets, j
The plane, which was traced to

a rental agency at the Oakland
airport, made four swings across
the campus before flying back
towards Cal.
The whole series of pranks be
gan late Wednesday night when i
a group of 14 Stanford men jour- ■
neyed up to South San Francisco!
and planted a monstrous "Beat ■
Cal" slogan on one of the hills j
which face Bayshore Freeway in !
the South S.F. area.
WHERE BEFORE there was
nothing but hard, bare California
soil, a 40-foot lime message call
ing for Stanford to "Beat Cal"
now appears.
The group who pulled that j
stunt off used 400 pounds of lime
to make the letters and were;
shielded by a fog which conven
iently rolled in as they began to
work before midnight.
After that ,iob was finished,
seven freshmen and sophomores
continued to Berkeley and im
printed a 35-foot high S in the
hillside above the new Cal dor
mitories.
Like the Bayshore lettering, the
S was done with 400 pounds of,
lime and was six yards wide.
TIIE ONES who accomplished
that feat had to wait until 1 a.m.
when the guard in the area was

changed. It look thorn just 15
minutes to do their work and
mako an escape.
To make sure all went well,
they had "staked out" the area
earlier in the day and actually
had made three "dry runs."
And finally, The Daily nearly
became the victim of a Cal "joke"
early yesterday morning.
A group of college-age males
appeared about 2:30 a.m. in the
building behind the Daily Shack
where the paper is printed as the
presses were turning out the
Thursday Daily.
THE INTRUDERS, who had
blackened their faces and may
have been Cal students who
scrawled blue "Cal" messages on
several buildings and sidewalks
around campus Wednesday eve
ning or yesterday morning, hesi
tated, wondering what they could
do to foul up The Daily.
They quickly decided to do
nothing when one Daily press
man advanced on them wielding
a foot-long knife kept in the
building and told them to leave.
They did, while the other press
man was calling Stanford police.
What next?
Stanford and Cal students yes
! terday raided each other's cam
j puses in one of llic wildest days
! in Big Game history.
While the highlight of the day
! was the disappearance of the Axe.
intrepid Indians and Bears also
used an airplane, 800 pounds of
lime and dump trucks to pull off
a series of stunts.
MAIN STANFORD COUP was
I the planting of a 29-foot, bright
! red steel S on the hillside above
! Cal's football stadium. The new
! addition to the Berkeley campus
j should be visible for all to see to-
J morrow, unless Cal somehow
