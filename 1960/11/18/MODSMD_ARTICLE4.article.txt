# Frosh Plant Steel ‘S’ At Berkeley

### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Stanford and Cal students yes
! terday raided each other's cam
j puses in one of llic wildest days
! in Big Game history.
While the highlight of the day
! was the disappearance of the Axe.
intrepid Indians and Bears also
used an airplane, 800 pounds of
lime and dump trucks to pull off
a series of stunts.
MAIN STANFORD COUP was
I the planting of a 29-foot, bright
! red steel S on the hillside above
! Cal's football stadium. The new
! addition to the Berkeley campus
j should be visible for all to see to-
J morrow, unless Cal somehow
manages to remove the S. This
probably will require dynamite,
since the letter is made of welded
steel and is anchored to the Cal
turf with concrete, strengthened
by iron rods.
A group of about 15 freshmen
from Rineonada House, Wilbur
Hall, turned the neat trick right
under the noses of Cal students,
who apparently saw nothing un
usual when a couple of trucks
pulled up on the hillside and a
I number of "workmen" piled out
] and went to work.
