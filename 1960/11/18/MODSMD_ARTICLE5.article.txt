# POPULAR FAVORITES COMBINED
## Band Planning 'Electric' Jazz Show for Tomorrow 
### PAT REINHART 
California's Memorial Stadium
will be swingin' tomorrow,
when the Stanford Marching
Band presents its 1 !)(>() Big Game
show of jazz. Described as "elec
tric" by Assistant Band Manager
Ed Strong, the program will be
composed of music and forma
tions from performances of the
last six years. The numbers, all
popular favorites, have never
been combined in one perform
ance before. They have been in
tegrated to portray the birth and
growth of jaZz.
The show will open to the tune
of an old-time spiritual, rhythmic
forerunner of modern jazz, "He's
Got the Whole World in His
OTIIKK periods of jazz will I

recalled by such numbers as
"Alexander's Rag-Time Band."
"Blues in the Night" and Pen
nsylvania Six-Five-Thousand."
Since band acts and card stunts
will not lie coordinated at Big
Game, spectators will see two
different shows. The pom pon
girls will perform with the band,
however.
TIIE BIG GAME band corps,
slightly larger than usual, will
have 130 members. A surprising
fact about this squad of talented
musicians is that not one is a
music major. About .">0 per cent
are engineers, and many are so
cial science students.
Even for an exhibition as de
tailed as their Big Game show,
the band practices onlv twice a
week, plus a brief session before
games. This is considerably less
than other college bands, which
rehearse five days a week (Cal
practices 15 hours a week).
Roy Stehle is the band mana
ger. Ed Strong is assistant man
ager, and Julius Shuchat, music
director of the Palo Alto School
District, is the director. The stu
dent conductor is Jim Smith, and
the drum major is Chris Bianchi.
TIIE BAND will be a very
•sleepy group by Saturday. Be
sides performing at the Thursday
noon rally and tonight's
Bonfire Rally, they will be up
all night tonight entertaining at
alumni rallies. After stops at
Rickey's, the Hilton Inn. and the
Fairmont, they will conclude with
a show on the Top of the Mark.
Then it will be on to Memorial
Stadium to play the Indians' VIC
