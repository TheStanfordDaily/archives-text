# Huyck Certain Of Card Win By Team, Fans

### MARGE HARDING 
Covered with "Beat Cal" but
tons, and wearing his long trou
sers so that people wouldn't com
plain any more about his bony
knees, Head Yell Leader Phil
Huyck seemed certain that the
Cards would win Big Game this
year.
"Cal has had its win," he said.
"Now it's our turn. And what's
more, our rooting section will
beat them as badly as our team
will. We're going to have terrific
spiritâ€” people will be wild, in
censed, frenzied. They'll lose their
heads. Hysteria will prevail. But
we'll win!"
I'll 11,, W HOSE term as yell
leader will expire in six weeks,
was noncommittal on the subject
of integrated rooting sections. "1
think we should definitely have
both boys and girls in the sec
tion," he commented with a
straight face. When pressed fur
ther, he stated that the UCLA
game was a good example of how
good an integrated cheering sec
tion could be. "On the other
hand," he continued, "the section
at the USC and OSU games were
separated. Actually, it's not the
seating that counts but the gen
eral attitude of the students."
Phil winced when asked what
would happen if it rained to
morrow. "It shouldn't be to bad
the only tilings it would hurt are
Cal's card tricks. I think ours are
run-proof."
