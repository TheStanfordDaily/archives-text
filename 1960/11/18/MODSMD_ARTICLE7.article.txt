# AXE GONE--GAME NEAR
## Stanford, Cal Fray On Tap Tomorrow 
### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
The littlest Big Game ever is on tap in Berkeley's Memorial Stadium
tomorrow with the kickoff slated for 1:30 p.m.
The contest is "little" to everyone in the world except two football
teams, a couple of coaches, and 76,780 fans who will turn out to see it.

THE THOUGHT of so many
people coming to see two teams
who have won one game between
them may seem a little silly but
they're bound to get their mon
ey's worth.
There are about 48 ways to
prove that last statement. We'll
run down a couple that come im
mediately to mind.
1. Desire—To say that both
teams are hungry would be under
stating the case. Stanford will be
out to keep a worst-ever record
from being tagged on them. No
Stanford team has ever lost 10
games in a season and the last
winless season for the Farm was
back in 1947 when the final tally
was 0-9.
Cal has one victory and one tie
this season making it one of the
worst on record for the Bears.
THUS the. 63rd Big Game will
go down as the one in which both
teams had nothing to lose except
another football game.
2. Comparative scores Cal's
lone triumph this season came at
the expense of Oregon State,
| whom Stanford lost to last week
.on a disputed penalty call. The
Bears tied Washington State ear
lier in the season after the Cou
gars had slipped by the Indians
in the first game of the season,
15-14.
Looking at the rest of the com
mon opponents, the game is a
toss-up. Cal lost to Washington
by 20 points. Stanford lost to the
Huskies by 19. Cal lost to Oregon
i by 20. Stanford lost to the Ducks
bv 21.
Cal lost to SC by 17. The
Tribe lost to the Trojans by 15.
The Bears lost to UCLA by 28 and
the Indians lost to the Bruins by
[ 18. You figure it out.
PAST BIG GAMES There
j have been 62 Big Ones before 1 his
j one; Cal has won 27, Stanford has
won 25 and there have been 10
| ties.
| The last two contests arc two
lof the most exciting football
I games ever played. Two years
ago at Cal the Bears pulled it
out, 16-15. That was the first
year that the two-point conver
sion rule was in effect and the
j first year that a team which
I scored two touchdowns and a
: field goal Stanford ever lost 1o
a team that scored only two
| touchdowns- Cal.
A BIG controversy broke out
when a Stanford pass try for the
I two-pointer was ruled no good be
cause Indian end Irv Nikolai was
said to be out of the end zone
when he caught the throw.
Pictures of the play seemed to
i show that the call had been a
| bad one, but even though ref-
I erees aren't always right they're
never wrong. Cal stayed the win
j tier.
Last year at Stanford Cal won
2017, notwithstanding the fact
Dick Norman set the alltime in
