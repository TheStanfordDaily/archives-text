# Bonfire Lighting Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford freshmen worked on
into daylight hours this morning
in an attempt to build what Fresh
man Class President Robert:
Friese called "the biggest bon
fire ever" on the floor of Lake
Lagunita.
If all goes well and no one sets
the bonfire aflame prematurely,
Prince Lightfoot will throw a
flaming torch on Oskie's funeral
pyre at the end of the traditional
Big Game rally which begins at
6:15 p.m.
THE FKOSH under the direc
tion of Cardinal Chairman Frank
Morgan began construction at
midnight. At 6 a.m. the Roble
dollies began serving coffee and
donuts under the direction of
their sponsors.
Late yesterday evening a lire on
the wood piles sent Stanford fire
equipment racing to the Lagunita
lakebed to put out a blaze which
was reported by Lagunita life
guards.
Early in the evening last year's
head yell leader Bill Kartozian
arrived by plane from Harvard
Law School to be master of cere
monies for the Big Game Rally.
