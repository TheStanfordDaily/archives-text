## 
### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley Three hard charging Cali
fornia backs niacin excellent use of numerous holes in Ihe Stanford
defense to give Cal a 21-10 win in the 63rd Big Game here Saturday
and to give Stanford its worst football season of all time. The loss
marks the 11th in a row for the Indians, who won narv a all

season.
Fullback George Pierovich and
halfbacks Steve Bates and Jerry
Scattini formed the nucleus of a
Cal ground game that couldn't
have been more effective, and
sophomore quarterback Randy
Gold called plays with the pre
cision and coolness of a profes
sional as the Bears finished out
an unsuccessful season on a suc
cessful note before 76.200 fans.
Cal has a 2-7-1 overall record for
the 1960 campaign.
CAL JUMPED off to a 14-0
half time lead and although the
Cards cut the lead to four points
early in the fourth period the
Bears remained in control
th roughout.
Pierovich, Scattini and Bates
carried the ball 16. 15 and 13
times respectively and each aver
aged around five yards per try
at the Stanford defenses. Gold
surprised all by throwing only
one pass, far fewer than his per
game average for the rest of the
season. He made his one toss a
good one. A four-yarder to Bates
in the first quarter for Cal's first
touchdown.
This score came seven minutes
and 28 seconds after Cal received
the opening kickoff. Starting on
their own 26 yard line, the Bears
picked their way for five and six
yards at a crack with Pierovich
and Bates packing the pigskin
most of the way with some added
help from Jim Burress. The drive
never showed signs of bogging
down and ended with Gold's pass
to Bates who was all by his lone
some in the end zone.
JIM FERGUSON kicked the
point after and Cal led 7-0.
Stanford started a drive of its
own as Steve Pursell recovered a
fumble by Gold, who was trapped
going back to pass, on the Cal
45 as the first quarter ended.
The Indians moved well into
Cal territory with halfback Gil
Dowd racking up most of the
yardage over the middle and
through the tackles.
Stanford had a first down on
the Cal nine and Skip Face took
a pitchout from quarterback Dick
Norman and swept his right end
to the home squad's four.
FACE TRIED the same thing
to the left side on the next play
and was nearly tackled on the 10,
but broke loose and got back to
the line of scrimmage. On the
next play it was Face again, this
time to the right side, but Bates
was waiting for him and dumped
him for a one-yard gain.
The fourth down play was a
pass from Norman intended for
end Dale Ostrander in the end
zone, but it was wide and the
Bears took over on their three.
Here the Berkeleyans proved
themselves as the three afore
mentioned members of the Cali
fornia back field, with not another
soul carrying the ball, drove the
97 yards to a Bear touchdown.
IN THIS drive Cal had only
two third down situations and
Scattini went over through right
tackle from the one-yard line for
the score.
Again Ferguson's kick was
good "and the Bears led at half
time by 14-0.
The Tribe got on the score
board in the ihird period with a
75-yard drive that took 17 plays.
Face went the final yard for the
score after!he, Dowd and wing
back Mac Wylie took turns bring
ing the ball downfield. Face
kicked the PAT to close the gap
to 14-7.
FIVE PLAYS later Stanford
got the ball again and started
moving toward the Cal goal line
from its own 12. Norman took
to the air this time and mixed
passes with the ground attack.
Norman hit Ostrander once and
Wylie three timesâ€”one for' 35
yards- and the Tribe was on the
Cal 12.
The Bears picked that time to
knock down a couple of Norman's
throws in the end zone and Face
kicked a 29-yard field goal to
make the score 14-10 for Cal.
Cal took the ensuing kickoff
on their own 39 yard line and
moved to their last score. Bates,
Sea 1 tini and Pierovieh, with just
a little bit of Randy Gold mixed
in. gave Cal the score that put
them out of reach. Ferguson's try
for the point after made it 21-10.
THE TRIBE started a final
drive which abruptly ended when
Bates picked off a long Norman
pass inteded for Wylie on the
California 12 and ran it back to
the 37.
Norman finished with 11 pass
completions out of 21 attempts
for 133 yards.
