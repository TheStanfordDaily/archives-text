## 
### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
MEMORIAL STADIUM, Berkeley Three hard charging Cali
fornia backs niacin excellent use of numerous holes in Ihe Stanford
defense to give Cal a 21-10 win in the 63rd Big Game here Saturday
and to give Stanford its worst football season of all time. The loss
marks the 11th in a row for the Indians, who won narv a all

season.
Fullback George Pierovich and
halfbacks Steve Bates and Jerry
Scattini formed the nucleus of a
Cal ground game that couldn't
have been more effective, and
sophomore quarterback Randy
Gold called plays with the pre
cision and coolness of a profes
sional as the Bears finished out
an unsuccessful season on a suc
cessful note before 76.200 fans.
Cal has a 2-7-1 overall record for
the 1960 campaign.
CAL JUMPED off to a 14-0
half time lead and although the
Cards cut the lead to four points
early in the fourth period the
Bears remained in control
th roughout.
Pierovich, Scattini and Bates
carried the ball 16. 15 and 13
times respectively and each aver
aged around five yards per try
at the Stanford defenses. Gold
surprised all by throwing only
one pass, far fewer than his per
game average for the rest of the
season. He made his one toss a
good one. A four-yarder to Bates
in the first quarter for Cal's first
touchdown.
This score came seven minutes
and 28 seconds after Cal received
the opening kickoff. Starting on
their own 26 yard line, the Bears
picked their way for five and six
yards at a crack with Pierovich
and Bates packing the pigskin
most of the way with some added
help from Jim Burress. The drive
never showed signs of bogging
down and ended with Gold's pass
to Bates who was all by his lone
some in the end zone.
JIM FERGUSON kicked the
point after and Cal led 7-0.
Stanford started a drive of its
own as Steve Pursell recovered a
fumble by Gold, who was trapped
going back to pass, on the Cal
45 as the first quarter ended.
