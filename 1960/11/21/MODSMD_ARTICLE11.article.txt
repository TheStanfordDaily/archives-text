# Another Example

John Robert Johnston, a foreign student from Scotland only
a semester away from his Ph.D. decree in physics at tlie I Diversity
of California, must leave the country.
Mis crime: picketing the House Un-American Activities Com
mittee hearings held in San Francisco last spring. A I .S. Immi
gration Department spokesman said Johnston "did not maintain
his st at us as a bona fide student. Charles J. Beechie, district I inm i
gration director, said Johnston's deportation is due to "a number
of other factors . . ." hut Beechie was "not at liberty to discuss
them, not even with Johnston.
Johnston maintains that the decision of the Immigration Serv
ice would he justifiable onlv if an alien student was unlawful, dan
gerous, or subversive. Johnston claims that lie is not guilty on any
of these counts. It is interesting to note that the Immigration Serv
ice does not consider Johnston a risk to U.S. security. As a matter
of fact, it is not at all clear as to just what the Immigration Service
considers Johnston.
Johnston claims that the Immigration Service was pressured
into deporting him by Representative Francis I'. W alter of Penn
sylvania, thÂ« i Chairman of the House Un-American Activities Com
mittee and also a Senior Member of the House Sub-Committee on
Immigration! Johnston's claim probably is justifiable.
There is, in our estimation, no justification for Johnston's de
portation. Johnston was simply exercising his democratic preroga
tive of freedom of speech. Some American students who demon
strated against the committee have lost scholarships and awards
because they dared to disagree with the HUAC.
The Daily has already said what it thinks of the HUAC. We
feel that the Johnston case is just another example of why the
HUAC must be destroyed.
Today's editorial page is devoted to statements by Johnston
concerning his case and an article by Robin Mac Donald, an Eng
lisli teaching assistant at Stanford, a foreign student from Scotland,
and Robertson's friend. This page presents only one side of the
story; however, the Immigration Service seems content with pre
senting its side by saying, "Johnston did not maintain his status
as a bona fide student.
