(Editor's Note: The following
article is comprised of portions of
John Robert Johnston's state
ments on Sept. 5 and Oct. 23,
1960.)
It seems to me that this severe
decision of the Immigration Serv
ice would be justifiable only in
the circumstances that the alien
student was unlawful, dangerous,
or subversive. Any of these
charges in my case, I firmly be
lieve, are completely unfounded.
I am aware, however, of the
following arguments by the Im
migration Service:
1. The alien student did not
limit himself to the purpose for
which he was admitted.
But surely it is not expected
that a foreign student conies to
tlk- United States ONLY to study.
He intends to broaden his experi
ence and his thinking in many
ways, and hopes to benefit from,
and perhaps contribute to, those
activities of his community in
which he is interested.
It may he said that politics is
outside the scope of these activi
ties, but neither my wife nor 1
had encountered such a belief in
previous experiences. At St. An
drews University, in Scotland,
there was each year a significant
group of American students
along with many other foreign
students.
They often played active roles
in political as well as other ac
tivities, and I do not remember
anyone believing that they acted
out of place. I remember U.S. stu
dents campaigning vigorously for
a member of Parliament candi
date they favored and can recall
only delight at the students' in
terest and enthusiasm.
Then I have read of U.S. stu
dents joining in the Aldermasten
to London march, a protest of
significant proportion in Great
Britain against government pol
icy. But I am not aware of their
being censured for this action.
My wife and I supposed that a re
ciprocal attitude would exist in
this country.
2. The alien student was a
guest in (his country, he accepted
the U.S. taxpayers money and
then proceeded to criticize the
U.S. Government.
Of course, this is misleading.
To criticize a particular aspect of
policy of a government is not to
criticize that government as a
whole. Furthermore, a sincere
critic acts with the sole purpose
to improve a situation, and in
criticizing the HUAC, we believed
we were assisting in a service
rather than a disservice to this
country.
And it is difficult to remember

to consider oneself a guest after
nearly four years in a community
in which one feels almost wholly
integrated. It is true that I have
received considerable amounts of
money in four years, and for the
generosity shown me by the Uni
versity and my department I -shall
always be grateful.
If the Immigration Service
wishes to put into effect the
above arguments, then I believe
it only fair that foreign students
should be notified of the political
restrictions under which they
will be placed while visiting the
United States.
At present no notification of
restrictions, other than subver
sion, is given either at the time
the visa is granted nor on arrival
in the United States. In my case
a very serious course of action
has ln*en taken by the Immigra
tion Serv ice when 1 have never
been informed or warned that the
activities I engaged in could lead
to such action.
In conclusion, let me state that
I am deeply distressed that there
exists, in this country today,* an
organization (the House Un-
American Activities Committee)
with the power to intimidate, to
harass, and to ruin those individ
uals who dare believe themselves
free to express criticism of that
body.
I believe it is a serious back
ward step in the evolution of our
system of justice that such an
organization is permitted to op
erate outside the court of law,
which, after all. was established
to protect the civil rights of the
helpless individual from the
wrath of those with power to
destroy him.

student was unlawful, dangerous,
or subversive. Any of these
charges in my case, I firmly be
lieve, are completely unfounded.
I am aware, however, of the
following arguments by the Im
migration Service:
1. The alien student did not
limit himself to the purpose for
which he was admitted.
But surely it is not expected
that a foreign student conies to
tlk- United States ONLY to study.
He intends to broaden his experi
ence and his thinking in many
ways, and hopes to benefit from,
and perhaps contribute to, those
activities of his community in
which he is interested.
It may he said that politics is
outside the scope of these activi
ties, but neither my wife nor 1
had encountered such a belief in
previous experiences. At St. An
drews University, in Scotland,
there was each year a significant
group of American students
along with many other foreign
students.
They often played active roles
in political as well as other ac
tivities, and I do not remember
anyone believing that they acted
out of place. I remember U.S. stu
dents campaigning vigorously for
a member of Parliament candi
date they favored and can recall
only delight at the students' in
terest and enthusiasm.
Then I have read of U.S. stu
dents joining in the Aldermasten
to London march, a protest of
significant proportion in Great
Britain against government pol
icy. But I am not aware of their
being censured for this action.
My wife and I supposed that a re
ciprocal attitude would exist in
this country.
2. The alien student was a
guest in (his country, he accepted
the U.S. taxpayers money and
then proceeded to criticize the
U.S. Government.
Of course, this is misleading.
To criticize a particular aspect of
policy of a government is not to
criticize that government as a
whole. Furthermore, a sincere
critic acts with the sole purpose
to improve a situation, and in
criticizing the HUAC, we believed
we were assisting in a service
rather than a disservice to this
country.
And it is difficult to remember

to consider oneself a guest after
nearly four years in a community
in which one feels almost wholly
integrated. It is true that I have
received considerable amounts of
money in four years, and for the
generosity shown me by the Uni
versity and my department I -shall
always be grateful.
If the Immigration Service
wishes to put into effect the
above arguments, then I believe
it only fair that foreign students
should be notified of the political
restrictions under which they
will be placed while visiting the
United States.
At present no notification of
restrictions, other than subver
sion, is given either at the time
the visa is granted nor on arrival
in the United States. In my case
a very serious course of action
has ln*en taken by the Immigra
tion Serv ice when 1 have never
been informed or warned that the
activities I engaged in could lead
to such action.
In conclusion, let me state that
I am deeply distressed that there
exists, in this country today,* an
organization (the House Un-
American Activities Committee)
with the power to intimidate, to
harass, and to ruin those individ
uals who dare believe themselves
free to express criticism of that
body.
I believe it is a serious back
ward step in the evolution of our
system of justice that such an
organization is permitted to op
erate outside the court of law,
which, after all. was established
to protect the civil rights of the
helpless individual from the
wrath of those with power to
destroy him.

which he was admitted.
But surely it is not expected
that a foreign student conies to
tlk- United States ONLY to study.
He intends to broaden his experi
ence and his thinking in many
ways, and hopes to benefit from,
and perhaps contribute to, those
activities of his community in
which he is interested.
It may he said that politics is
outside the scope of these activi
ties, but neither my wife nor 1
had encountered such a belief in
previous experiences. At St. An
drews University, in Scotland,
there was each year a significant
group of American students
along with many other foreign
students.
They often played active roles
in political as well as other ac
tivities, and I do not remember
anyone believing that they acted
out of place. I remember U.S. stu
dents campaigning vigorously for
a member of Parliament candi
date they favored and can recall
only delight at the students' in
terest and enthusiasm.
Then I have read of U.S. stu
dents joining in the Aldermasten
to London march, a protest of
significant proportion in Great
Britain against government pol
icy. But I am not aware of their
being censured for this action.
My wife and I supposed that a re
ciprocal attitude would exist in
this country.
2. The alien student was a
guest in (his country, he accepted
the U.S. taxpayers money and
then proceeded to criticize the
U.S. Government.
Of course, this is misleading.
To criticize a particular aspect of
policy of a government is not to
criticize that government as a
whole. Furthermore, a sincere
critic acts with the sole purpose
to improve a situation, and in
criticizing the HUAC, we believed
we were assisting in a service
rather than a disservice to this
country.
And it is difficult to remember

to consider oneself a guest after
nearly four years in a community
in which one feels almost wholly
integrated. It is true that I have
received considerable amounts of
money in four years, and for the
generosity shown me by the Uni
versity and my department I -shall
always be grateful.
If the Immigration Service
wishes to put into effect the
above arguments, then I believe
it only fair that foreign students
should be notified of the political
restrictions under which they
will be placed while visiting the
United States.
At present no notification of
restrictions, other than subver
sion, is given either at the time
the visa is granted nor on arrival
in the United States. In my case
a very serious course of action
has ln*en taken by the Immigra
tion Serv ice when 1 have never
been informed or warned that the
activities I engaged in could lead
to such action.
In conclusion, let me state that
I am deeply distressed that there
exists, in this country today,* an
organization (the House Un-
American Activities Committee)
with the power to intimidate, to
harass, and to ruin those individ
uals who dare believe themselves
free to express criticism of that
body.
I believe it is a serious back
ward step in the evolution of our
system of justice that such an
organization is permitted to op
erate outside the court of law,
which, after all. was established
to protect the civil rights of the
helpless individual from the
wrath of those with power to
destroy him.
(Editor's Note: The following
article is comprised of portions of
John Robert Johnston's state
ments on Sept. 5 and Oct. 23,

It seems to me that this severe
decision of the Immigration Serv
ice would be justifiable only in
the circumstances that the alien
student was unlawful, dangerous,
or subversive. Any of these
charges in my case, I firmly be
lieve, are completely unfounded.
I am aware, however, of the
following arguments by the Im
migration Service:
1. The alien student did not
limit himself to the purpose for
which he was admitted.
But surely it is not expected
that a foreign student conies to
tlk- United States ONLY to study.
He intends to broaden his experi
ence and his thinking in many
