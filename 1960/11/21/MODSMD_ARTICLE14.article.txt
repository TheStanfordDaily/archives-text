# Vast Helplessness
## 
### ROBIN MACDONALD 
Last spring a foreign student
at the University of California
was among those who picketed
the House Un-American Activi
ties Committee at City Hall in
San Francisco. On Nov. 17, the
San Francisco Chronicle carried
a story telling how this student,
Mr. John R. Johnston, had now
been ordered by the U.S. Immi
gration Department to leave the
United States because of his ac
tion protesting the committee.
Johnston was not a student at
Stanford, and so his case should
hardly concern us here, yet I
think it does, and if it does not. 1
would like to make it concern us,
because I am prejudiced about
this whole business 1 am both a
friend of Johnston and a foreign
student myself.
It would be easy to make an
emotional plea: Johnston is (to
quote from the Chronicle) "a bril
liant young Scot," within six
months of a Ph.D. in biophysics.
He had been a Donner Fellow at
Berkeley for two years and a
teaching assistant for another
two years.
This year lie was appointed As
sociate in Medical Physics. He is
married; lie lias two sons â€”one
only a few weeks old. lie has been
ordered to leave within two
weeks; lie has l>een refused per
mission to stay long enough to
finish his doctorate. Ilis research

in genetics lias been interrupted,
and his career perhaps broken.
Mis wife has been driven half
crazy with worry.
I would like to make clear that
I Johnston picketed the HI T AC in
all innocence, quite unconscious
I that his action would lead to his
j expulsion from this country. He
I may have been foolish to do so.
I He may not have had the right to
express his feelings here, a guest
i of the country.
But he considered that he had
; that right. The United States to
i a foreigner, and especially to an
unprejudiced forei g n e r who
knows some American history,
'still often represents what the
Voice of America still claims the
country represents such moral
principles as the freedoms of
| speech, of the press, and of Ihe
J individual.
That Johnston was innocent
enough to believe be could say
what he wanted, how he wanted,
in this country can be seen from
bis official statement, and espe
cially from his assumption in it
that since Americans are allowed
the same measure of political
freedom in Britain as the British
(that is, to express their views, it
not to vote), lie would be thus
permitted to express his views
here (if not to vote).
The point I would like to make
! clear i-s this: the ideals laid down
in the Constitution and in the
Declaration of Independence
make a powerful appeal to the
intelligent liberal abroad, and
! chief among these ideals are the
I various guarantees of freedom.
If these freedoms are going to
he limited and controlled in prac
j tice, then Hie innocents abroad
j must be thoroughly prepared be
| fore they enter the country. For
eign students should be warned
of the restrictions on their polit
ical liberty; they should be told
jto keep their noses clean all for
j their own good.
Of course it is unrealistic of us
' not to realize that the double
I standard exists in this country,
and to think that the ideals we
J pay lip service 1o must not suffer
i some sort of compromise when
j interpreted by bureaucracy -but
what distresses me is that those I
j have talked to at Stanford, almost
| without exception, not only rec
ognize this discrepancy but seem
j quite happy to defend it."He
j WAS very foolish; you know . . ."
1 personally feel a vast help
lessness in this business; I know
1 can do nothing, and I suppose
nobody else can either. From this
position I fancy it will be danger
ously easy to drift into an atti
tude of cynicism and disgust.
