Editor, th<* Daily:
We wore appalled to read of
the recent order to deport John
Robert Johnston, a Scottish grad
uate student in physics at the
University of California, because
of his picketing the House Un-
American Activities Committee
hearings in San "Francisco last
spring.
It has apparently been made
clear to Mr. Johnston that he "is
not considered a risk to U.S. se
curity," but that he was engaging
in activities "that are not the
sort of thing that a foreign stu
dent or visitor should participate
in."
Clearly, this action on the part
of the U.S. Immigration Service is
a flagrant violation of the indi
vidual's light to freedom of
speech as guaranteed by the U.S.
Constitution. This Constitution,
we have been led to believe, pro
tects all people in the U.S., not
just those who agree with the
House Un-American Activities
Committee.
Nor can we swallow the asser
tion that the action taken against
Mr. Johnston is based solely
upon being a foreigner. Rather,
the front pages of the newspapers
have continually reported in
stances in which U.S. students
have also had grants and scholar
ships revoked because of their
protest against this committee.
The specter of Rep. Francis
Walter, Chairman of the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee and Senior Member of the
House Sub-Committee on Immi
gration, hoveling in the hack
ground i-s hardly comforting. It
is not unreasonable to assume
that Mr. Johnston is correct when
he says that Rep. Walter was in
strumental in bringing pressure
to bear upon the Immigration
Service for his deportation.
How can thinking citizens help
but be conscience stricken by
such direct infringements upon
the democratic process? Must
people who have differing opin
ions he arrested or deported to
preserve American solidarity?
We think not./The very strength
of democracy rests with the in
dividual's right to express his
opinion, whatever this opinion
may be. We have expressed ours;
we hope that: others who are sim
ilarly horrified by the action
against Mr. Johnston will express
theirs.

Committee.
Nor can we swallow the asser
tion that the action taken against
Mr. Johnston is based solely
upon being a foreigner. Rather,
the front pages of the newspapers
have continually reported in
stances in which U.S. students
have also had grants and scholar
ships revoked because of their
protest against this committee.
The specter of Rep. Francis
Walter, Chairman of the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee and Senior Member of the
House Sub-Committee on Immi
gration, hoveling in the hack
ground i-s hardly comforting. It
is not unreasonable to assume
that Mr. Johnston is correct when
he says that Rep. Walter was in
strumental in bringing pressure
to bear upon the Immigration
Service for his deportation.
How can thinking citizens help
but be conscience stricken by
such direct infringements upon
the democratic process? Must
people who have differing opin
ions he arrested or deported to
preserve American solidarity?
We think not./The very strength
of democracy rests with the in
dividual's right to express his
opinion, whatever this opinion
may be. We have expressed ours;
we hope that: others who are sim
ilarly horrified by the action
against Mr. Johnston will express
theirs.

We wore appalled to read of
the recent order to deport John
Robert Johnston, a Scottish grad
uate student in physics at the
University of California, because
of his picketing the House Un-
American Activities Committee
hearings in San "Francisco last
spring.
It has apparently been made
clear to Mr. Johnston that he "is
not considered a risk to U.S. se
curity," but that he was engaging
in activities "that are not the
sort of thing that a foreign stu
dent or visitor should participate
in."
Clearly, this action on the part
of the U.S. Immigration Service is
a flagrant violation of the indi
vidual's light to freedom of
speech as guaranteed by the U.S.
Constitution. This Constitution,
we have been led to believe, pro
tects all people in the U.S., not
just those who agree with the
House Un-American Activities
Committee.
