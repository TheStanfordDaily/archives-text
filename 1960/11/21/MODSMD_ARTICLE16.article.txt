Kditor, the Daily:
Last Friday a letter to the edi
tor quoted in regard to Senator
Kennedy's election that "Seldom
in Soviet history had the press
and radio applauded the defeat
of a U.S. presidential candidate so
gleefully, emotionally, and unre
strainedly." The letter went on
to imply that on this basis the
Kennedy victory was a mistake.
The Editor replied in the same
issue of the Daily with a lengthy
but misdirected and poorly sup
ported editorial.
Mr. Carlton's letter to the editor
does raise an interesting ques
tion: must we react oppositely to
all the actions of the Soviet Re
public? This negative attitude
that we must support everything
the U.S.S.R. opposes, and oppose
everything they favor, has, in the
past several years, crept into the
thinking of this country's leader
ship and consequently into our
foreign policy.
This defensive thinking is dan
gerous in that our policies can
more easily be controlled by our
enemies. Had the Russians want
ed Nixon elected they would only
have had to publicly condemn
him; we would have reacted ac
cording to their wishes.
The Soviet Republic responded
'gleefully' to Kennedy's election
(i.e., Nixon's defeat). I think this
was an honest reaction and was
not 'synthetic exuberance.' At the
same time we should note that
many of the other nations fin
eluding Great Britain, France,
and Germany) also reacted with

satisfaction to the election results.
I believe the over-all world re
sponse to Senator Kennedy's vic
tory w ill be fine of increased opti

mism for the future; I hope that
the new leadership of the United
States will develop a more posi
tive foreign policy. 1). S. Kliupe
