# Curtice Lauds Cards: 'In There Fighting
## Daily Sports 
### 
"Cactus" Jack Curtice leaned
heavily on one of the walls of the
I narrow passageway adjacent to
ji he visitors' locker room. His
! squad had just lost the Big Game
! and a score of reporters wanted
to know why.
The usually jovial Curtice had
difficulty in smiling. The pass
ageway was dark and sombre;
only a few sounds could he heard
from the locker room next door
where the players were getting
ready for the long trip back.
"THE KIDS feel awful let
down," Curtice said. "You have
to give them tremendous credit.
They were in there fighting all
j the way."
California played havoc with
the middle of the Stanford line
for most of tlie day, especially in
the first half. "They were push
ing one tackle around the entire
first half," Curtice commented.
"No matter who we put in there,
they'd run over him."
Curtice wasn't overly pleased
with the officiating. He felt that
perhaps interference should have
been called on the Cal defender
i who knocked down Steve Pursell
in the end /one in the fourth quar
ter on a Norman pass. After the
incompletion, Skip Face kicked a

field goal which still left the In
dians down by four points.
Til ft TURNING point, accord
ing to Curtice, occurred in the
second quarter when the Indians
failed to tally from the three-yard
line. Cal was only ahead by a
touchdown at the time.
All was not gloomy in Mudville,
however. Curtice had nothing
but praise for some of the play
ers; Face, Wylie, Fernandes, Nor
man and Peter. "This was the
team's game all the way," Cur
tice said. "They called all of the
plays and decided all of the situa
tions."
The interview didn't last very
long. There is really very little
to say after losing the Big Game
and completing a most disastrous
season.
The reporters thanked Curtice
and started to file out toward the
players to see how Ihey felt. Ev
eryone knew how they felt the
same way Curtice felt who
! summed it all up just before he
entered the locker room: "Wait
till next year."

with the officiating. He felt that
perhaps interference should have
been called on the Cal defender
i who knocked down Steve Pursell
in the end /one in the fourth quar
ter on a Norman pass. After the
incompletion, Skip Face kicked a

field goal which still left the In
dians down by four points.
Til ft TURNING point, accord
ing to Curtice, occurred in the
second quarter when the Indians
failed to tally from the three-yard
line. Cal was only ahead by a
touchdown at the time.
All was not gloomy in Mudville,
however. Curtice had nothing
but praise for some of the play
ers; Face, Wylie, Fernandes, Nor
man and Peter. "This was the
team's game all the way," Cur
tice said. "They called all of the
plays and decided all of the situa
tions."
The interview didn't last very
long. There is really very little
to say after losing the Big Game
and completing a most disastrous
season.
The reporters thanked Curtice
and started to file out toward the
players to see how Ihey felt. Ev
eryone knew how they felt the
same way Curtice felt who
! summed it all up just before he
entered the locker room: "Wait
till next year."
"Cactus" Jack Curtice leaned
heavily on one of the walls of the
I narrow passageway adjacent to
ji he visitors' locker room. His
! squad had just lost the Big Game
! and a score of reporters wanted
to know why.
The usually jovial Curtice had
difficulty in smiling. The pass
ageway was dark and sombre;
only a few sounds could he heard
from the locker room next door
where the players were getting
ready for the long trip back.
"THE KIDS feel awful let
down," Curtice said. "You have
to give them tremendous credit.
They were in there fighting all
j the way."
California played havoc with
the middle of the Stanford line
for most of tlie day, especially in
the first half. "They were push
ing one tackle around the entire
first half," Curtice commented.
"No matter who we put in there,
they'd run over him."
Curtice wasn't overly pleased
with the officiating. He felt that
