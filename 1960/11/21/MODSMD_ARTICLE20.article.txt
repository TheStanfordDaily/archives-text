# Bears Coach Relieved After First 'Big Game'
## 
### KEN DERY 
Marv Levy seemed more re
lieved than happy as he talked to
the small band of sportswriters
after Saturday's 21-10 victory
over Stanford in the Big Game.
"Stanford really came back
tough in the second half didn't
they?"
"I knew that the score of last
year's contest was 14-0 at the half
and I really got scared when they
started to move the ball so well.
When Stanford started driving
with the score 14-7 I had dire
thoughts going through my mind.
I saw them scoring a touchdown
and then going for the two-point
conversion."
ON 10 OF t he writers asked when
Levy thought Cal had the game
won? His reply was that he con
sidered the issue in doubt all the
way up to the point when half
back and co-captain Steve Bates
intercepted an Indian aerial. "I
looked up at the clock and saw
1:59 remaining and then I
thought we were in."
The interview was but half
over, but the young coach ex

cused himself to walk out onto
the balcony which towered above
a crowd of fans and the California
Blue and Gold marching band.
"I want to thank you all again
for your loyal support week after
week even after losses," he said.
"I hope to see you all next year.
Thanks again."
LEVY returned and related that
the team had voted to give the
game ball to the band which had
shown such great spirit toward
the team all season long.
Getting back to the game, the
gentle-looking mentor, in his first
year at Cal, singled out certain
boys that he thought had played
outstanding games,
"George Pierovich at fullback
did a good solid job, as did Jerry
Scattini, Randy Gold and of
course Bates. This was without
doubt Bates' best game of the
year and Gold at quarterback ran
a real smart game. Stanford
seemed to be alternating their
defense first to the inside and
then to the outside and Randy
alternated his play calling well."
