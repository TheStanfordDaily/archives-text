## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
California proved that il is a
worthy representative to the
NCAA playoffs by defeating Stan
ford 3-0 Saturday on a soccer field
at California that looked like a
mud bowl.
Cal made it look easy, despite
the fact that three of its best play
ers were held out of the game for
three quarters because Cal coach
Bob DiGrazia knew, that as four
year lettermen, they were ineligi
ble to compete in the playoffs and
he wanted to give their replace
ments game experience.
THE GAME started slowly. Cal
dominated the first quarter and
scored first, with 19:02 gone in
the first quarter on Bill Barreda's
first of two goals.
in the second quarter the pat
tern was reversed, with Stanford
controlling the play but being un
able to put the ball into Cal's net.
Cal went ahead 2-0 in the third
quarter with eight minutes gone
in the period on Barreda's second
goal.

Stanford's except for one freak
Cal score. Alex Kersevan passed
crossfield to Rich Prydz who shot
at the goal. The ball bounced off
several players before Prydz put
it in.
Stanford almost scored several

times in the final period, but Cal's |
two-time All-American goalie
Fred Becker made several spec
tacular saves. Once, he dived
| sideways and slid along the
j ground to stop Rune Engebrett-
I sen's perfect shot.
For Stanford Bernie Knaggs
was the outstanding player. When
Mike Tippett was unable to play,
i he had to switch to the front line
from his halfback position and
i played a spectacular game. Stan
< ford coach Fred Priddle singled
out the defense ir. general for
holding Cal to half its scoring
average.
IN PARTICULAR, he men
tioned Rusty Williams, Knaggs,
Dick Bartlett, and Beau and
Adam Bianehi for their fine work.

cludes teams from CCSF, USE,
and San Francisco State.
The preliminary game begins
at 7 p.m. on the San Francisco
State field, with the All-Star
i game immediately following.
California proved that il is a
worthy representative to the
NCAA playoffs by defeating Stan
ford 3-0 Saturday on a soccer field
at California that looked like a
mud bowl.
Cal made it look easy, despite
the fact that three of its best play
ers were held out of the game for
three quarters because Cal coach
Bob DiGrazia knew, that as four
year lettermen, they were ineligi
ble to compete in the playoffs and
he wanted to give their replace
ments game experience.
THE GAME started slowly. Cal
dominated the first quarter and
scored first, with 19:02 gone in
the first quarter on Bill Barreda's
first of two goals.
in the second quarter the pat
tern was reversed, with Stanford
controlling the play but being un
able to put the ball into Cal's net.
Cal went ahead 2-0 in the third
quarter with eight minutes gone
in the period on Barreda's second
goal.
THE FOURTH quarter was
Stanford's except for one freak
Cal score. Alex Kersevan passed
crossfield to Rich Prydz who shot
at the goal. The ball bounced off
several players before Prydz put
it in.
Stanford almost scored several

times in the final period, but Cal's |
two-time All-American goalie
Fred Becker made several spec
tacular saves. Once, he dived
| sideways and slid along the
j ground to stop Rune Engebrett-
I sen's perfect shot.
For Stanford Bernie Knaggs
was the outstanding player. When
Mike Tippett was unable to play,
i he had to switch to the front line
from his halfback position and
i played a spectacular game. Stan
< ford coach Fred Priddle singled
out the defense ir. general for
holding Cal to half its scoring
average.
IN PARTICULAR, he men
tioned Rusty Williams, Knaggs,
Dick Bartlett, and Beau and
Adam Bianehi for their fine work.
The mud slowed up Emmanuel
Andah, a 10.6 hundred meter man
' from Ghana.
Stanford closes out its soccer
season Tuesday. In a double
header. The Stanford junior var
sity plays the Cal junior varsity
| and the South All-Stars face the
