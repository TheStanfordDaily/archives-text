# Reporters Show Biz Whirl Ends After One Night Stand in Gaieties
## 
### JEAN EBERHART 
If anyone noticed a slightly con
fused cast member in Gaieties one
night last week, she was a Daily
reporter soaking up atmosphere
for a story to reveal exactly what
goes on backstage during a per
formance.
This reporter arrived about an
hour before time and was sub
jected to the rigors of the make
up department and a bewildering
set of instructions simplified only

by the stage manager's comment,
"Just follow the person in front
of you."
HER STAGE debut included
walking across the stage, playing
cards with her back to the audi
ence, and pretending to know the
words to the songs. Unfortu
nately, she had no idea as to what
the rest of the performers were
doing and muffed her big chance
at an acting career. However, the
managing editor had not told her

to learn to act; he just wanted a
story about what it was like to
be in Gaieties.
The reporter had heard (hat ac
tors were supposed to be nervous
before a performance, but there
was no evidence of nervousness
in the Gaieties cast. Phemie
Brownell, featured in several
skits, declared, "It's easy to see
why we're not nervous we're
having too much fun!"
"BE lIAPPY in your work" was
the Gaieties cast motto And in
deed this cast was happy. The
performers must have enjoyed
themselves even more than the
audience did. Besides laughing
and joking, cast members were
dancing backstage to the music
of several vocal numbers and
even jumping rope in the hall
leading to the dressing rooms.
Purplish-blue lights, vertical
lines of the curtains, muffled calls
for the next act, and silent cast
members watching the stage from
the wings and waiting for audi
ence reaction provided a dramatic
atmosphere backstage. The cast's
outbursts of laughter shattered
this atmosphere whenever some
one on stage ad-libbed a line or
something went wrong.
THE CAST meeting just before
curtain time alternated between
being complimentary and critical
of the previous evening's presen
tation. Speaking to individual
cast members, the director, Jim
Gleason, said, "You did a very
good job, but . . . ," and he pointed
out specific weaknesses. This
meeting lasted past curtain lime,
but this was shrugged off with
the remark, "A late start gives
the audience a chance to all get
here."
THE GAIETIES performers
went out of tlreir way to make a
newcomer welcome. She really
began to feel like a true cast
member, though, when she was
asked to contribute to a fund be
ing collected backstage.

and joking, cast members were
dancing backstage to the music

Purplish-blue lights, vertical
lines of the curtains, muffled calls
for the next act, and silent cast
members watching the stage from

this atmosphere whenever some
one on stage ad-libbed a line or
something went wrong.
THE CAST meeting just before
curtain time alternated between
being complimentary and critical

cast members, the director, Jim
Gleason, said, "You did a very

out specific weaknesses. This
meeting lasted past curtain lime,

the audience a chance to all get

HERE'S WHERE WE REALLY CUT THE DAILY . . .
Pete Groom, Gaieties stage manager, tells Jean Eberhart.
If anyone noticed a slightly con
fused cast member in Gaieties one
night last week, she was a Daily
reporter soaking up atmosphere
for a story to reveal exactly what
goes on backstage during a per
formance.
This reporter arrived about an
hour before time and was sub
jected to the rigors of the make
up department and a bewildering
set of instructions simplified only

by the stage manager's comment,
"Just follow the person in front
of you."
HER STAGE debut included
walking across the stage, playing
cards with her back to the audi
ence, and pretending to know the
words to the songs. Unfortu
nately, she had no idea as to what
the rest of the performers were
doing and muffed her big chance
at an acting career. However, the
managing editor had not told her

to learn to act; he just wanted a
story about what it was like to
be in Gaieties.
The reporter had heard (hat ac
tors were supposed to be nervous
before a performance, but there
was no evidence of nervousness
in the Gaieties cast. Phemie
Brownell, featured in several
skits, declared, "It's easy to see
why we're not nervous we're
having too much fun!"
"BE lIAPPY in your work" was
the Gaieties cast motto And in
deed this cast was happy. The
performers must have enjoyed
themselves even more than the
audience did. Besides laughing
and joking, cast members were
dancing backstage to the music
of several vocal numbers and
even jumping rope in the hall
leading to the dressing rooms.
