Nobody knows WHERE. The
Axe isn't at Cal, and it isn't at
Stanford either.
It was last seen in a San Lean
dro camera shop Saturday morn
ing. Three college students asked
Manager Bob Pratt to photograph
it and sent a print to the Oakland
Tribune.
Friday night the Axe may have
appeared here at the Bonfire
Rally. Opinion is split between
those who are 99 per cent sure
the Axe displayed was genuine,
and those who are just as sure
it was fake.
Erik O'Dowd and Ed White, the
rally com members who displayed
the Axe at the rally, were unavail
able for comment this weekend.
O'Dowd spent the weekend at a
San Francisco hotel and White
refused to talk to reporters.
STANFORD POLICE were un
able to find the Axe at the Alpha
Sigma Phi fraternity house—both
O'Dowd and White are members
—and left a special officer in the
house living room to turn away
dozens of Cal students who want
ed to conduct their own search.
The Daily Californian reported
the UC campus was "sure" that
Stanford did NOT have the Axe.
Among the rumors at Cal were:
• Bill Kartozian was flying it
back to Harvard.
• Cal Halfback Steve Bates had
it in the back seat of his car.
• Berkeley High School stole it.
STANFORD ASSU President
Larry Royse said he didn't think
Stanford had the Axe and added
that he was impressed with the
sincerity of Cal officials at their
Friday night rally in the Greek
Theater. "I think that if the Axe
had been returned to Cal. the offi
cials would have said so," Royse
said.
Head Yell Leader Phil Huyck
said he didn't get a good look at
the Axe displayed Friday night at
the Bonfire rally, but that all the
people he had talked to seemed to
feel it was genuine. "Of course,
most of them have never seen the
Axe before." Huyck said.
The Daily Californian reported
the Cal rooting section was "very
surprised" that the Axe didn't ap
pear at the game.
The 15-inch blade has been
stolen from Stanford three times,
from Cal four times. In 1946 it
was returned to a Palo Alto po
lice car. In '48 it was found on
the Stanford Golf Course, and in
'53 it was found in a Stanford
football player's car.
In the summer of 1956 the axe
was taken from the Stanford Cel
lar through the use of a blow
torch and cold water on the case
containing it. Four months later,
just before the SC game, it was
found in co-captain John Brodie's
car with a note attached stating,
"From the unknown."
Once again, ihe whereabouts
of ihe Axe remains unknown.
