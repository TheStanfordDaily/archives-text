# The
						Problem
## 
### 
There is no doubt, about it. This year's freslmian class is the
best to come to Stanford. Yet, this class is possibly having more
academic problems than most classes of the past.
No one seems to he quite sure where the difficulty lies. Some
freshmen have become dangerously distraught. One, supposedly
despondent over poor grades, committed suicide. Many freshmen
who earned nothing hut A's in high school are finding it difficult
to maintain a ('. average in their first quarter here.
Actually, there is no reason for the freshmen to panic. Stanford
is quite a big leap from high school. Even the most intellectual'of
students must adjust to university education. Instructors do not
coddle their students as many do in high school. The student is
expected to shift for himself.
It takes an average Stanford student approximately one quarter
to adapt himself to Stanford's stringent requirements. A fresh
man's first quarter is not only an academic test, but a psychological
one as well. Stanford strikes the incoming freshman as a cold,
austere place which is trying to knock him down. But this mis
conception quickly dissipates as freshmen are integrated into the
multitudinous activities which abound on this campus.
Many administrators and faculty members are worried about
the freshman class. Professor James T. \\ atkins I\ of the Political
Science department is one of those who is keenly aware of what
the freshmen are facing. Below this editorial is an article by Pro
fessor Walking which every freshman would do well to read.
We would also suggest that freshmen lake the article home to
their parents and MAKE them read it! Parents represent perhaps
one of the most acute problems facing freshmen. They fail to
understand the situation and are too demanding.
There is one more important problem—the faculty—which
will he discussed in the Daily tomorrow. For the time being, how
ever, we would like to second Professor Watkins' comments: Fresh
men, you represent the best class to ever come to Stanford. Give
yourselves a chance to become oriented, then you will receive all
..i Ii
of the dividends you expect from Stanford.
