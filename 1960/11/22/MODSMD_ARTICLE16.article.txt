# Deadlier Than Smog
## 
### 
BY JAMES T. WATKINS IV
Deadlier than the smog which
blights this valley may be the
cloud of apprehension or down
right fear blanketing our fresh
man dormitories to stifle all nor
mal thought in our newest youth.
So widespread is the evidence, I
so numerous are the complaints
from students, sponsors, resident
faculty, coaches, counsellors and
dean's office that the development
of an ugly situation would seem j
to be beyond argument.
And if further tragedies, major
and minor, and near tragedies,
desertions, leaves and other con
sequences of the situation are to
be avoided, some new effort to
reassure the freshmen about
Stanford and about themselves
would seem to be both imperative
and overdue. Something must be
done to restore to them their lost
belief in themselves and in Stan
ford. For they ARE good! And
Stanford is good! And each be
longs to each other.
This campus is not the harsh,
unfeeling place which it may
seem to appear now that we have
rounded the midpoint of their
first quarter with its bottomless
homesickness and its plague of
"cinch" notices.
And the freshmen are not the
dolts and misfits that "encourag
ing" grades on themes and mid
quarters, "cinch" notices and pa
rental and professorial warnings
may have led them to think.
In Pre-Reg Week the freshmen
learned that Stanford is "big
league." which they always knew,
and what that means in our ex
pectations of them, which they
can have little realized.
If, as they since have discov
ered, Stanford has off-seasons in
football and half-seasons in school
spirit (dramatically retrieved this
year), they will not doubt that
its season for greatness, largeness
of purpose and high endeavor is
perennial.
But today they are no longer
spectacularly certain that Stan
ford is, as they once believed, the
place for them to come and work
and learn and grow. To find them
selves. To make their way.
True, this is the time of the
freshman year when such doubts
are normal. As winter on
and deepens, these doubts grow.
Only towards the end of January
or later in February is the gloom
dissipated and the freshman, find
ing that Stanford has somehow
got into him, perceives that he is
finally a part of Stanford.
But this year we dare not wait.
They must be told what has not
been sufficiently emphasized:
namely, that each one of them is
here because we at Stanford
KNOW that he or she has what
it takes to make the grade—and
the grades. If not by Thanksgiv
ing, as it appears, then surely by

Christmas. Not just the freshman
class in general, but YOU. John
Jones, and YOU, Mary Smith.
However it may be with my
colleagues, since the day I myself
came to Stanford as a freshman
—thirty-five years ago this fall
—I have never known a student
who once admitted to Stanford
COULD not measure up to the
measure of Stanford; I have in
deed known some who for one
reason or another DID not meas
ure up. In every such case, how
ever, the choice I have felt lay
with the student.
It happens, too, that once last
year I dropped by a dean's office
just as the dean was signing let
ters notifying students who had
been suspended from Stanford for
academic deficiencies. Out of
nearly 9000 students on the rolls
less than twenty-five were to re
ceive these letters, some would be
reinstated as soon as overdue pa
pers made up incompletes, and
few of the twenty-five were fresh
men. I thought then and I think
now that all twenty-five could
have avoided suspension.
Tell the freshmen, then—each
freshman—not to panic! Tell
them that there is no reason for
panic. None in Stanford nor, un
less they put it ihere, in them
selves !
As for dreams of academic ex
cellence, these can wait until afler
Christmas, when the quarterly
grades (reflecting performance
alone without the distorting "en
couragement" factor of earlier
grades) show what a given in
vestment of time and effort pro
duces at Stanford. Until then
what basis is there for a freshman
to calculate his chances?
Tell the parents, too, to lay off.
These first midquarter grades are
not all that they seem. Regard
less of appearances and portents,
let this be a season of real
Thanks-giving. Their sons ami
daughters are at Stanford! Mean
while all that these ask in this
time of adjustment and response
to a challenge bigger than they
httve vet known but NOT EX
CEEDING THEIR POWERS is
that they shall find patience and
support on the home front.
Stanford, still faithful to her
mission as a "university of high
degree," stands on the threshold
of a great era in her history. "The
golden years return," a new age
of pioneering and intellectual ad
venture and bold experiment such
is she knew under Dr. Jordan,
her first president.
At this juncture Stanford has
opened her doors to bring into
ler family a freshman class also
"of high degree," men and women
worthy of the times. Foster
mother and foster child, neither
will fail the other.
Shout it from the house-tops if
need l>e. WE believe it. Let the
freshmen believe it, too!
