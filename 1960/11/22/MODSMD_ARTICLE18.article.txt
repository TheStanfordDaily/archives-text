Editor, the Daily:
Announcing the new Stanford
abridged dictionary, edited by
Mr. Greenberg. Included are mod
ern interpretations of words al
tered by the march of history as
it moves forward in the vanguard
of democratic progress:
1) Justice and freedom: Not
ideals. Tools of imperialistic dom
ination.
2) Brink of war: Nuclear war.
3) Unrealistic: Holding to in
feasible tenets, e.g., winning the
Cold War.
4) USSR: Unrealistic nation.
5) USA: Mature and realistic
nation.
6) Maturity: State of nascent
senility.
7) Realism: Idealism. Mystic
belief that all areas and countries
] stained by evil will be regener-
I ated from within in the next
1,526 days.
8) Interventionism: Cold War
technique, to be employed if sug
gested by Kennedy, eschewed if
suggested by extremists.
9) Extremists: Potential op
ponents of Kennedy in 1964; usu
ally adhere to pluperfect patriot
ism.
10) Western World: Any area
not worth fighting for.
11) "Gitmo" Bay: Naval sta
tion in Cuba, in Western World,
therefore a suitably equipped lo
cation for a Russian missile
launching station.
12) Appeasement: (This word
has been dropped in this edition.)
13) Dynamic foreign policy:
Realistic concession.
14) Political eunuch: (This
word has been dropped in this
edition; see: "creative thinker,"
"flexible individual," "political
realist."

Editor, the Daily:
Barry G., extreme left wing edi
tor of the Luce-Sul/berger pub

lishing axis, is unhappy with
Barry G., "extreme right wing"
senator from Arizona. Since
space is limited, I shall consider
Mr. Greenberg's Cuban position.
1 > With a certainty normally
reserved for "Euclid's Elements,"
Mr. Greenberg pontificates: "A
show of U.S. strength in Cuba
would inevitably lead to Russia's
intervention in behalf of Cuba."
Really? When Khrushchev was
asked whether he would honor
his threats, he answered: "Merely
a symbolic gesture." The USSR
will engage the USA in war only
when her conflict managers agree
that existing power-ratios insure
victory. That day will yield war,
Cuba or no Cuba!
2) "America's strength does
not lie in her weapons or in her
ability to bully smaller nations,
but in her democratic institutions
which we must perpetuate and
practice." Greenberg's awe of So
viet. might and his fear that
American revisionism would pro
voke war, indicates, of course,
that he does not consider force as
decisive. He wants everything for
everybody, except for the millions
now enjoying proletarian "de
mocracy." Their misery, his pred
ecessors would not look upon,

even at high altitudes. (Spying is
evil and provokes war.)
3> "Goldwaterites undoubtedly
consider such an outlook as 'ideal
istic poppycock,' but if we don't
have idealism, then what do we
have?" Goldwater desires to
wage freedom and justice, not
merely say pretty things about
them.
