### 
Letters to the Editor should not
i exceed 250 words. Name, address
I and phone number should be in
| eluded. Typewritten letters have
; a better chance of appearing. Let
I ters shall be printed without
i change except in the case of po-
I tentially libelous material. The
; fact that any letters hold an op
posite viewpoint from the Edi
' torial Board will not matter.
