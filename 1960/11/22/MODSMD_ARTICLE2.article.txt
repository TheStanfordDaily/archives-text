# Meeting at Cal Held to Protest Deportation
## 
### 
Over 300 University of Califor
nia students and faculty members
attended a meeting yesterday to
protest the impending deportation
of John R. Johnston, Scottish
graduate student in physics at
Cal.
Cal students have set up
a "Johnston Anti - Deportation
Committee," with headquarters
near the campus in Berkeley. Two
petitions are being circulated at
Cal protesting the action against
Johnston. Students circulating
the petitions said at the protest
meeting that the petitions, one to
be signed by foreign students and
one by Americans, may be sent
either to President Eisenhower or
Secretary of State Christian Her
ter.
PRINCIPAL speaker at the
meeting was another Briton, Brian
Van Arkadie, an economics grad
student who said he expects rela
tions between the United States
and Great Britain to be strained
as a result of the Immigration
Service ordering Johnston out of
the country because he partici
pated in a picket line outside a
meeting of the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee last
spring.
Van Arkadie stressed the am
biguity of foreign students' status
in the U.S., remarking that he
and his fellow Britons expect to
participate in political affairs at
least as much as American stu
dents do in Great Britain.
HE emphasized that the Immi
gration Service has admitted that
Johnston has not been involved
in subversive, harmful or illegal
activities. "Foreign students want
to be clearly forewarned so they
can limit their activities," he
added.
An effort is being made to en
list prominent Britons and Ameri
cans to come to Johnston's aid.
Johnston is preparing to go to
Canada if possible to continue his
studies. He has only a semester
left before taking doctoral exams
at Cal.
