Editor, 1 lie Daily:
We would like to relate an in
cident in San Jose which con
cerned some of your Stanford
students. Sunday, Nov. 13th, we
were alone in a Girls Residence,
when we were visited by several
of your students. All of them ap
peared to be under the influence
of some intoxicating beverage.
Initially their visit was to in
quire of the whereabouts of one
of the girls, but it soon became
apparent to those girls pi*esent
that, these "gentlemen" were
making themselves less and less
welcome, especially after they
(the boys) entered uninvited and
unannounced th r o u g h an un
locked bark door. After they were
asked to leave, it was noted that
several articles of some value,
both material and sentimental,
were missing from the house.
The San Jose Police were noti
fied and were present in the
house when these "gentlemen"
returned and again attempted to
enter; this time through a
window which they (the boys)
had previously unlocked to af
ford easy access.
We would like to inquire
of the Stanford Student Body, if
this type of action is part of their
curriculum or if we must wholly
place the blame upon these few
students? We hope that these
actions do not reflect the whole
Stanford Student Body.
Charges were not pressed when
the missing articles were returned
intact. These boys were, we be

lieve. simply reprimanded and
placed in the hands of juvenile
and school authorities. We hope
sincerely that we shall not be
further taxed with similar
visits from Stanford students.
Those who expected more
of Stanford Students!
Editor, the Daily:
We would just like to compli
ment the incredibly far-sighted
and accurate editorial in the
latest CHAPARRAL. Mr. Kitchen
has hit upon the chief problem of
Stanford- one which is turning
the school not-so-slowly but very
surely into the Berkeley of the
West Bay. Not that there's any
thing wrong with Cnl, but they
don't have to pay.
Seriously, we feel that the
Board of Trustees, President
Sterling, and all the others busy
shaping Stanford's "glorious" fu
ture consider what has made
Stanford great in the past. It was
not Bigness, it was not classes of
150 persons, it was not Ihe "pay,
pay, pay" with which we are con
tinually bombarded.
It is a shame that this is hap
pening. in our opinion. Quality,
and not quantity, is the impor
tant thing. We can have both. But
like the Soviet Union, we may be
concentrating on the heavy in
dustry and propaganda for our
selves, while overlooking com
pletely the all-important "con
sumer goods" our own educa
tion.
