A wrong has been committed. An injustice has been performed.
La si Thursday morning I was stunned upon glancing at Ihe San
Francisco Chronicle Sporting Green to see sprawled across Ihe all
eight columns a story telling of an effigy burning. I was unusually
so stum 'd because I realized that I was one of those being burned.
THE ARTICLE was concerned with the selection of Joe Ver
ducci of San Francisco State as Northern California Coach of the
Year. The students of Humboldt State were infuriated to say the
least that their own Phil Sarboe had been passed over in the balloting.
I had been present at this final

meeting of the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers on the
previous Monday because Daily
Sports Editor Ron Rapoport
thought there might be some
thing of interest. The back-of-the
yea r, lineman-of-the-year and
coach-ol'-t he-year were to be
named in addition to the weekly
speeches of the area's coaches.
Also since it was Big Game Week
we figured it would be interesting
to hear what Marv Levy of Cal
and Cactus Jack Curtice of Stan
lord would have to say.
The meeting took place at Ihe
Athens Club in Oakland and .just
as the lunch was ending a ballot
was passed to each sports writer
present. (They gave Rapoport
and me one ballot between us al-

though we were not traditional injustice has been done
members al these weekly gather
ings.) Jn glancing at the list for Coach of the Year the two of us
were undecided between Verducci of San Francisco State and Sarboe
of Humboldt State.
Reams of Copy
I \Vi:ir.l!i:i) ill my mind what I knew about both teams. San
Francisco State had been given reams of copy in the previous weeks
and 1 knew they were having a tremendous year. On the other hand
Humboldt State was ranked as one of the better small college teams
around. We voted for Verducci.
On Thursday as I sat reading the green sheet T slowly but most
assuredly saw my personal spoiling stock taking a nosedive. How
ever. I knew I was not alone. In fact I thought there were others
who should have been knocked even more.
The article pointed to Sarboo's 9-0 record, including a three-point
win over S.F. State to take the lead in the Far Western Conference.
Humboldt's students claimed "discrimination, provincialism, in
justice. hyprocrisy, indecency and all sorts of things." At the College
in Areata on Tuesday night three dummies representing unidenti
fied sportswt iters were burned in effigy.
Till*; ARTICLE really went deep: "Said J. Dwight O'Dell, pub
lisher of the Humboldt Bcacon in Fortuna and president of the Red
wood Empire Publishers' unit: 'The San Francisco Bay Area sports
writers were merely passing out garlands to one of their fellow
luncheoners.' "
Other critics around Areata, Fortuna and Ukiah were less soft
spoken. 'Sarboe.' said Brick Bralich, coach of Ukiah High, 'has IS
straight wins going. He outcoached Verducci in their game here. He
should be coach-of-the-year for the entire USA. not just Northern
California.'
Fumed A 1 Tostado, sports editor of the Humboldt Times: '. . . the
Writers' Association is a farce ... it cannot see beyond its collective
nose.' "
Head-to-Hsad Humboldt State Had Won
ICKFA I WKNT to check my records to see if the paper had
been right and sure enough it had been. In the. fourth game of the
year for both teams Humboldt State had taken the measure of Ver
ducci's boys by 21-18. I always considered myself to be a pretty
close follower of football scores as (1 i I love the game and <2> pick
seventeen games each week in the Daily. The only rationalization
that I could make was that both teams are of the "small college"
variety and I do not follow their experiences as closely as I would a
team such as Washington or Ohio State.
Nevertheless I had made a grave mistake. I had been influenced
by inches of copy instead of fact. But sportswriting is my hobby
it is the business of most of the other men present at that meeting.
As I looked back at the meeting I could recall the popularity
of short, squat Joe Verducci as he accepted the honor. This was
to 1)0 his last week of coaching, he related, as he was to become
athletic director.
I do not think that Verducci was given his career's final laural be
muse lie was retiring. I choose to believe that I lie Bay Area's sports
writers have heroine overconfident of their own abilities. They have
become overly loose in checking out all the small details that are so
much a part of the sporting scene.
They have allowed themselves to he blinded by amount of copy.
We all made a mistake. .May we all learn something by it.


PHIL SARBOE
