big Indian threat. A consistent
point maker, Spenee totaled 25
goals during the year.
Bates, the Stanford goalie, com
pletes the Indian "Biy Three."
Having to defend his goal behind
an inexperienced defense, he
nevertheless turned in outstand
ing efforts game after game in
addition to his capacity as team
leader.
Bates' value to his team is re
flected in that he was elected
captain for the year in a vote held
just before the Cal game.
