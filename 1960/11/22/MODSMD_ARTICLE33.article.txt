# Kennedy to Be Minority Chief
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI> â€” Sen.
John F. Kennedy will be a "mi
nority president the 12th in his
tory.
An unofficial, but almost com
plete, tabulation yesterday after
noon showed that Kennedy fell
short by more than 100.000 votes
of getting a majority of the bal
lots cast for president on Nov. 8.
The tabulation by United Press
International counted the votes
from all but 51 of the nation's
166,264 voting places. It included
all but a small portion of the late
counted absentee ballots.
At that point, the percentage
margin by which Kennedy led
Vice President Richard M. Nixon
in popular votes stood a fraction
below the record low set in the
1881 election.
The latest tabulation showed:
Kennedy, 34.,049.287; Nixon, 33,-
845,878.
Kennedy's total was 147.879
below the 50 per cent mark a
margin which lie has no chance
of overcoming in view of the
small number of ballots still to
be tabulated.
