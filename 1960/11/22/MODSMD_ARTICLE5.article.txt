# Capacity Crowd Hears Montoya; Student Art Exhibit Acclaimed
## Great Guitarist Thrills Audience 
### BARRY RILEY 
A single chair on stage, a man
and his guitar . . . nothing else.
These were all that were needed
to hold a capacity crowd in Me
morial Auditorium spellbound for
two hours Sunday afternoon.
The man—Carlos Montoya, his
guitar—flamenco. In a concert
sponsored by the Institute of In
ternational Relations, the world
famed guitarist drifted easily
among the many gypsy rhythms
that are so familiar to his native
Spain.
Sometimes tapping his finger
nails in syncopation, sometimes
playing a melody with each hand,
he sat hunched over his big gui
tar oblivious to the hundreds of
witnesses to his singular art.
Flamenco music, even to the
uninitiated, is exciting music, and
Montoya has lost none of his ex
citement and /.est in the many
years ho has been playing the in
strument.
From the almost oriental mel
ody of the Moorish Samba to the
stately march tempo of the Saeta,
I Montoya was master. His hands,
sometimes graceful, sometimes
t flashing were never at rest as
; they moved up and down the neck
of the guitar or clicked on the
wood in syncopated mimic of a
dancer's shoes.
Proceeds of this performance
! went to an lIR scholarship fund
for two foreign students at Stan
