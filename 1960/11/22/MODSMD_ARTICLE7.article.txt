"This represents the work done
out of class, not for grades, by
people who really love art," Har
old Treacy said of the student art
exhibit he recently set up in the
lobby of Cubberley.
In contrast to the Art Depart
ment's exhibit in the spring, when
entries are based on class marks,
this is a collection of work by
students majoring in everything
from psychology to architecture,
and is selected by a special jury.
"Ol'T OF 120 entries last year,
only 60 were displayed. This year,
only 20 entries were dropped out
of 150," said Treacy.
The art work finally assembled
was presented to a distinguished
trio of judges: George Culler, di
rector of the San Francisco Mu
seum of Art; Alexander Fried,
art critic for the San Francisco
Examiner, and David Cole, owner
of a Sausalito art gallery.
Especially notable in the exhibit
is the variety of techniques com
petently handled by a few indi
viduals.
The grand prize, for example,
went to Scott Danielson, an archi
tecture major, for his cast con
crete sculpture entitled "Man's
Search for God." This tableau of
four-yard high, 150-lb. plaques
combines varying depths of base
relief.
DANIELSON also won second
prize in drawing for his posters,
featuring "nebbish"-type charac
ters in different poses. In addition,
Danielson has a wire-sculpture
and an oil painting on display.
Frances von Briesen, president
of the Student Art Association,
won first prize in drawing, and
third in oil painting. Her draw

ing, entitled "Adolescence," is
simple, but showing excellent
form. One of her paintings, "Lov
ers," shows this same strength of
line.
The' painting that won second
prize, on the other hand, is an ab
stract entitled "Summer." . It is
an intense blue-red pattern, with
a great deal of movement. She
has another abstract, entirely dif
ferent in feeling, called "High
Noon." This is a collage of light
yellows and brilliant reds, com
posed not of an all-over pattern
like "Summer," but of an off
center figure balanced by hori
zontals.
DAVE >1 eINTOSH won first
prize in oil painting with his ab
stract,' "Once in Wyoming." The
colors in this work seem inciden
tal; it has a more important depth
of composition and ingenuity of
form. Mcintosh also has an ink
drawing displayed which reflects
the influence of his travels in
Japan and an untitled photograph
which won first prize in that field.
A variety of sculpture was in
cluded in the exhibit. "In Trans
parency," a structure of multi
colored glass planes by Jim Elli
son, won third prize in this field.
Ellison, an architecture major,
has used the principles of this art
in arranging the glass to reflect
an ever-changing spectrum of
color. Larry Leifer won second
prize in sculpture with a cast
brass object called "Contained."
Examples of textiles, industrial
and furniture designs, architec
tural plans, water colors, and
plaster sculpture widen the scope
of the exhibit. Most of the items
are for sale.

DAVE >1 eINTOSH won first
prize in oil painting with his ab
stract,' "Once in Wyoming." The
colors in this work seem inciden
tal; it has a more important depth
of composition and ingenuity of
form. Mcintosh also has an ink
drawing displayed which reflects
the influence of his travels in
Japan and an untitled photograph
which won first prize in that field.
A variety of sculpture was in
cluded in the exhibit. "In Trans
parency," a structure of multi
colored glass planes by Jim Elli
son, won third prize in this field.
Ellison, an architecture major,
has used the principles of this art
in arranging the glass to reflect
an ever-changing spectrum of
color. Larry Leifer won second
prize in sculpture with a cast
brass object called "Contained."
Examples of textiles, industrial
and furniture designs, architec
tural plans, water colors, and
plaster sculpture widen the scope
of the exhibit. Most of the items
are for sale.
"This represents the work done
out of class, not for grades, by
people who really love art," Har
old Treacy said of the student art
exhibit he recently set up in the
lobby of Cubberley.
In contrast to the Art Depart
ment's exhibit in the spring, when
entries are based on class marks,
this is a collection of work by
students majoring in everything
from psychology to architecture,
and is selected by a special jury.
"Ol'T OF 120 entries last year,
only 60 were displayed. This year,
only 20 entries were dropped out
of 150," said Treacy.
The art work finally assembled
was presented to a distinguished
trio of judges: George Culler, di
rector of the San Francisco Mu
seum of Art; Alexander Fried,
art critic for the San Francisco
Examiner, and David Cole, owner
of a Sausalito art gallery.
Especially notable in the exhibit
is the variety of techniques com
petently handled by a few indi
viduals.
The grand prize, for example,
went to Scott Danielson, an archi
tecture major, for his cast con
crete sculpture entitled "Man's
Search for God." This tableau of
four-yard high, 150-lb. plaques
combines varying depths of base
relief.
DANIELSON also won second
prize in drawing for his posters,
featuring "nebbish"-type charac
ters in different poses. In addition,
Danielson has a wire-sculpture
and an oil painting on display.
Frances von Briesen, president
of the Student Art Association,
won first prize in drawing, and
third in oil painting. Her draw

ing, entitled "Adolescence," is
simple, but showing excellent
form. One of her paintings, "Lov
ers," shows this same strength of
line.
The' painting that won second
prize, on the other hand, is an ab
stract entitled "Summer." . It is
an intense blue-red pattern, with
a great deal of movement. She
has another abstract, entirely dif
ferent in feeling, called "High
Noon." This is a collage of light
yellows and brilliant reds, com
posed not of an all-over pattern
like "Summer," but of an off
center figure balanced by hori
zontals.
