# ...The Axe, The Axe, The Axeâ€”-THERE!
## Blade Returned to Cal; Details Still Unknown 
### JEAN EBERHART 
The missing Axe has been returned to Cal, but nobody knows
exactly what happened to it over the weekend.
Radio station KEWB in Oakland presented it to ASUC officials
at Cal's Stephens Union yesterday at 3:20 p.m. The Axe was re
turned with a police escort to Cal afler KEWB had broadcast

during the day that, they knew
where the Axe was. Sunday eve
ning about midnight, Walt Miller,
KEWB newscaster, was given the
Axe by two young men.
Richard Shurtz and Mitch
i Wuth, identifying themselves as
i Cal students, said they overheard
two Stanford students bragging
that they had the Axe at a Friday
afternon rally in San Francisco's
Union Square. Shurtz and Wuth
trailed the students back to their
car and got a good look at it.
Later Shurtz and Wuth drove
down to Stanford, found the Axe
in the car, and took it to keep
until they turned it over to
KEWB Sunday night.
A CHECK of Cal and Stanford
i records revealed that Shurtz and
Wuth are not registered at either
i of the two schools. Different ver
sions of the story set the time of
the recovery of the Axe from a
Stanford car as late as Friday
j afternoon, sometime Saturday, or
! between 2 and 3 a.m. Sunday.
Supposedly the Axe was dis
i played shortly at the Big Game
I rally here Friday evening. How
ever, Cal sources said that when
i the Axe was returned yesterday
| afternoon, the varnish was intact.
If it had been unbolted from the
I block recently, the finish would
| have been disturbed. The Axe at
; the rally was not mounted on a
I block.
It still is not known who took
I the Axe from a safe at Cal
Wednesday night or Thursday
morning and had it when a photo
graph was taken in San Leandro
Saturday morning to be sent to
the Oakland Tribune, or if the
Axe was ever in the possession of
Stanford students.
Erik O'Dowd and Ed White
claim to have had the Axe at the
rally Friday evening. They said
that it was given to them by two
unidentified men on the condi
tion that they would give it back
immediately after the bonfire. Re
ferring to the story given KEWB.
O'Dowd said, "It is obviously a
fabrication." O'Dowd and White
hope to check with Shurtz and
Wuth in several days to find out
exactly what happened to the
Axe.
THIS WAS the fourth time that
the blade has been taken from
Cal. Stanford has lost it three
times, the most recent being in
1956 when it was stolen from the
Stanford Cellar case through the
use of a blow torch and cold
water. Four months later it was
found in football co-captain John
Brodie's car.
The circumstances surrounding
this disappearance of the Axe are
still uncertain, but one thing is
definite, according to Cal offi
cials, the Axe is now back in Cal's
possession.

Wednesday night or Thursday
morning and had it when a photo
graph was taken in San Leandro
Saturday morning to be sent to
the Oakland Tribune, or if the
Axe was ever in the possession of
Stanford students.
Erik O'Dowd and Ed White
claim to have had the Axe at the
rally Friday evening. They said
that it was given to them by two
unidentified men on the condi
tion that they would give it back
immediately after the bonfire. Re
ferring to the story given KEWB.
O'Dowd said, "It is obviously a
fabrication." O'Dowd and White
hope to check with Shurtz and
Wuth in several days to find out
exactly what happened to the
Axe.
THIS WAS the fourth time that
the blade has been taken from
Cal. Stanford has lost it three
times, the most recent being in
1956 when it was stolen from the
Stanford Cellar case through the
use of a blow torch and cold
water. Four months later it was
found in football co-captain John
Brodie's car.
The circumstances surrounding
this disappearance of the Axe are
still uncertain, but one thing is
definite, according to Cal offi
cials, the Axe is now back in Cal's
possession.
The missing Axe has been returned to Cal, but nobody knows
exactly what happened to it over the weekend.
Radio station KEWB in Oakland presented it to ASUC officials
at Cal's Stephens Union yesterday at 3:20 p.m. The Axe was re
turned with a police escort to Cal afler KEWB had broadcast

during the day that, they knew
where the Axe was. Sunday eve
ning about midnight, Walt Miller,
KEWB newscaster, was given the
Axe by two young men.
Richard Shurtz and Mitch
i Wuth, identifying themselves as
i Cal students, said they overheard
two Stanford students bragging
that they had the Axe at a Friday
afternon rally in San Francisco's
Union Square. Shurtz and Wuth
trailed the students back to their
car and got a good look at it.
Later Shurtz and Wuth drove
down to Stanford, found the Axe
in the car, and took it to keep
until they turned it over to
KEWB Sunday night.
A CHECK of Cal and Stanford
i records revealed that Shurtz and
Wuth are not registered at either
i of the two schools. Different ver
sions of the story set the time of
the recovery of the Axe from a
Stanford car as late as Friday
j afternoon, sometime Saturday, or
! between 2 and 3 a.m. Sunday.
Supposedly the Axe was dis
i played shortly at the Big Game
I rally here Friday evening. How
ever, Cal sources said that when
i the Axe was returned yesterday
| afternoon, the varnish was intact.
If it had been unbolted from the
I block recently, the finish would
| have been disturbed. The Axe at
; the rally was not mounted on a
