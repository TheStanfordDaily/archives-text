City Hall last May 13 when police
and young people clashed at a
hearing of the Congressional ocm

SAN FRANCISCO (UPH — The U.S. Immigration Service re
versed itself yesterday and decided not to force John R. Johnston,
a brilliant Scottish biophysicist, out of the country because he
picketed the House Committee on Un-American Activities..
Charles J. Beechie, regional immigration director, said the case

had been carefully reconsidered
because Johnston's departure
would he a loss to the University
of California program and be
cause it would affect the univer
sity instructional schedule.
JOHNSTON, 2«, has been a
teaching and research associate
at Cal since 1956. He needs seven
more months at Berkeley to gain
his doctorate.
The Immigration Service grant
ed Johnston's request to remain
in this country until next Aug. 31.
Johnston was notified on Sept.
3 that his visitor's visa, which
expired Sept. 15, would not be
renewed. This was an adminis
trative action that the U.S. Immi
gration Service is empowered to
take.
CECIL W. FULLILOVE, dep
uty district director for the Immi
gration Service, gave this explana
tion for the department's action:
"I thought it was getting out of
line for a foreign student to
picket a committee of Congress.
They are guests of the country,
receiving government funds." Im
migration officials said other fac
tors were involved, but they
would not disclose them.
Johnston, claimed it was the
right of anyone, under the U.S.
Constitution, to act as he did and
that his limited participation in
the American political scene was
far less than the participation of
American students in English pol
itics.
