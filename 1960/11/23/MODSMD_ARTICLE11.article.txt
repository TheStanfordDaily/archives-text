# Kasavubu Delegation Wins Seat in General Assembly
## Vote Comes as Congo Troops Beat, Arrest U.N. Officials 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI) â€”The General Assembly voted
lasl night to seat a Congolese delegation appointed by Pro-Western
President Joseph Kasavubu.
The vote was 53 to 24 with 19 abstentions.
The action was a major boost to Kasavubu's prestige as loader

of the Congolese government and
a severe blow to efforts of Rus
sia and its friends to restore to
power Kasavubu's ousted leftist
premier, Patrice Lumumba.
The vote was taken on a U.S.-
backed recommendation of the
Assembly's Credentials Commit
tee to seat the Kasavubu delega
tion in preference to one ap
pointed by Lumumba. Both dele
gations have been in New York
since the start of the session last
Sept. 20 but the Assembly, keep
ing the Congo's seat vacant, rec
ognized neither until last night.
EARLIER, the Assembly by a
50 to 32 vote, with 14 abstentions,
rejected a crippling amendment
submitted by Guinea which would
have struck out the Credentials
Committee's recommendation to
seat the Kasavubu delegation and
would have had the Assembly
defer decision on seating either
of the rival groups.
Determined opposition to seat
ing Kasavubu's delegation was
offered by Russia, India. Ghana
and Guinea in the debate which
started late last week.
In Leopoldville yesterday, Con
golese troops beat and arrested
United Nations officials in an
angry climax to their bloody and
successful drive to oust repre
sentatives of Ghana. Hopes of
peace in the Congo sank to their
lowest ebb.
AS GHANA'S special envoy
Nathaniel Welbeck led his na
tion's diplomatic corps out of the
Congo aboard a Russian-manned
air transport, Congolese troops
stopped U.N. officials driving to
work, roughed them up and ar
rested them. Homes of several
U.N. officials were entered and
searched and their occupants
beaten.
Yesterday afternoon, the U.N.
still was negotiating for the re
lease of a dozen U.N. employes
carted off to Camp Leopold 11.
The armed clash between Con
golese troops and U.N. forces in
Leopoldville Monday threatened
for- a time to upset an Assembly
decision on the Congo credentials
question.
INDIA CHARGED that action
of the Congo army in firing on a
Tunisian contingent of the U.N.
force guarding the Ghanian dip
lomat constituted war waged by
the government of the Congo
against the United Nations.
An adjournment motion of
fered by Ghana was defeated. A
motion offered earlier in the de
bate. to adjourn discussion of the
credentials issue until a concilia
tion commission appointed by
Secretary-General Dag Hammar
skjold's Congo Advisory Commit
tee also was defeated.
