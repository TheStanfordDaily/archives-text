Editor, the Daily:
The editorial in the Daily of
Friday, Nov. 11, concludes with
the following statement: "Let's
stop worrying so much about the
ridiculous possibility of usurpa
tion of our rights from within by
Senator Kennedy and start worry
ing a little more about usurpation
of our rights from the real enemy
—communism."
It seems to us that, in this con
clusion and in the body of your
editorial as well, you have re
jected as "ridiculous" a possibil
ity which deserves some careful
thought; the possibility that "gov
ernment control" may eventually
lead to the usurpation of our in
dividual liberties.
One notices a striking parallel
between your position and that of
the more rabid, unthinking sup
porters of the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee whom
you have strongly denounced. Re
place Senator Kennedy in the
above quotation with the Un-
American Activities Committee
and it could have been written
by the D.A.R.
At least one intellectual feels
that a centralized welfare state
may be incompatible with free
dom. Aldous Huxley, in the in
troduction to a recent edition of
"Brave New World," stated:
. . unless we choose to decen
tralize and to use applied science,
not as the end to which human
beings are to be the means, but
as the means to producing a race
of free individuals, we have only
two alternatives to choose from:
either a number of national, mili
tarized totalitarianisms ... or
else one supranational totali
tarianism, called into existence
by tho social chaos resulting from
rapid technological progress . . .
and developing, under the need

for efficiency and stability, into
the welfare-tyranny of Utopia."

Editor, the Daily:
I am one of those who voted
for Pauling in the recent straw
vote. I did so to show my con
cern about the danger of atomic
war. Although I do not think any
government would deliberately
start an atomic war, there is an
ever-present danger of its start
ing by some misunderstanding
on the part of a military com
mander or even of a single
bomber pilot. In any nuclear war,
most people have an excellent
escape clause: "Oh well, so what?
I'd be dead then." But I am sure
that many millions of Americans
—including hundreds of us who
are now at Stanford would find
themselves alive after an atomic
war. (I'm not considering the
cobalt bomb, but what govern
ment would manufacture such a
bomb, which would destroy all
life in the country sending it as
well as in the one receiving it?)
We would be reduced to grub
bing a meager living from the
soil—or to stealing some other
Americans' harvests. The fear of
radiation would make those of
us who managed to migrate to
Latin America meet great preju
dice there.
To consider such consequences,
I propose that an "Atomic-War
Week" be instituted at Stanford,
in which students would write
essays on their conception of life
in a country ruined by a nuclear
holocaust.
If we think more about these
things I'm sure we will give
added support to Kennedy's at
tempts to reach a disarmament
agreement with the Russians
next year.
