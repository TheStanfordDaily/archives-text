Editor, tin 1 Daily:
Regarding Dr. Watkins' article,
"Deadlier Than Smog," I would
like to suggest to the learned
professor at this time that the
only truly "golden" aspect of the
present era at Stanford is the
ever-increasing tuition with
which we are all continually bur
dened. Far be it from me to criti
cize Dr. Watkins' attempt to re
vitalize the paling class of 'G4; the
attempt is noble in purpose if not
in execution.
I would, however, tacitly -sub
mit to the professor that the pros
pect either of the administration
or the student body as a whole
shouting from the roof tops, "You
can get better grades—just be
lieve in yourselves!" is not going
to comfort the average freshman
at this point, nor is it going to
convince him that grades still
aren't the primary objective.
For that is exactly what Dr.
Watkins implies when he sug
gests that every freshman "has
what it takes to make the grade
—and the grades." We just can't
escape that all-important, fact,
can we? For all the pious plati
tudes and reassurances, what it
actually comes down to is grades.
And what freshman at this point
is going to be reassured by that
fact when he knows full well he's
not cutting the mustard "grade
wise" (else why the little pink
reminders from the administra
tion. the letters from home, the
nagging self-doubt, which nearly
all of us have experienced at one
time or another since entering
these hallowed halls)?
No. I would submit to Dr. Wat
kins that if his primary concern is
really for the peace of mind of
the average freshman (or as close
to real peace of mind as can be
attained under the present sys
tem*, that we all get down off
those roof tops and admit that
it's grades.
We all wish we could afford to
spend all of our time pursuing
"education," but at present there
are other factors involved: a 3.5
grade point if your goals include
the dean's list, a 3.0 if it's to be
a scholarship or grad school, a
2. plus for a fraternity or eating
club, etc. Set your goals, but meet
them head on. Heed not the
golden voice bespeaking "the
golden years of pioneering and
intellectual adventure," of "bold
experiment" and high ideals. It's
grades that count and you're not
going to escape them that easily
these coming four years (and

isn't it a pity, too).
John Bradley
Editor, the Daily:
I am rather disturbed by Mr.
Rankin's views on the ROTC. He
does not seem to have made much
effort to become informed on the
subject, or to think his ideas
through logically. Unfortunately,
his general attitude on this sub
ject is shared by many college
students.
Mr. Rankin's stand against vol
untary ROTC does not seem to
be in accord with "the indepen
dence and free thought which a
good university must encourage."
He forgets that all of the students
in Stanford ROTC units have en
rolled.of their own choice, and in
many eases this has meant a
great deal of extra work ( for 'stu
dents majoring in science or en
gineering, for example). I should
hope that most of them feel, as
I do, that this is the most respon
sible way for an intelligent and
educated citizen to fulfill his mil
itary responsibility.
The doctrine of "a big war or
a little war" is flatly contradicted
by the history of the past fifteen
years. In 1950, when we had un
questioned nuclear superiority,
our reluctance to use it involved
us in an extended ground conflict
lasting three years, in which our
air and naval superiority proved
indecisive, and our ground forces
were left to carry the burden.
Now that our nuclear capa
bility is questionable, this is al
most certain to be the situation
facing us in any future conflict.
The trained leadership provided
by the ROTC is probably our
most valuable asset in expanding
our ground forces to meet such
a war.
Since the Stanford ROTC does
not interfere seriously with Mr.
Rankin's education, one is led to
believe that he prefers not to be
reminded of the threat of war in
today's world. We are dealing
with a cold, implacable enemy,
who only understands the argu
ment of force.
His resort to other means since
the stalemate in Korea shows, I
hope, a healthy respect for the

determination of the free world
to use it, if necessary. Let us
hope that enough Americans are
willing to assume the responsi
bility of maintaining an armed
force sufficient to support the
stand of the free world against
Communism.
John Rieber
Editor, the Daily:
Mr. Rankin's editorial concern
ing ROTC in your Nov. IT issue
showed a degree of immaturity
and naivete which is unbefitting
a person holding the position of
Associate Editor of any news
paper.
One of the purposes of a uni
versity is to prepare its students
to live in the world—peacefully if
possible. History, however, has
shown that war ha's sometimes
been necessary if a country was
to protect its freedom. While I
would be the last one to advocate
war, there is nothing in history
or the world situation today
which eliminates the possibility
of war.
The next war, if there is one,
may be "big or little" as Mr. Ran
kin suggests, or it may start lit
tle and grow big. If we are to
preserve our freedom, we must
be prepared for all of these situ
ations. Any one of them will re
quire military leaders, and lead
ers are made, not born.
The modern army has become
so technical that the old "art" of
warfare has. in many respects,
become the "science" of warfare.
Leaders must be trained accord
ingly, and this cannot be done
overnight.

I am rather disturbed by Mr.
Rankin's views on the ROTC. He
does not seem to have made much
effort to become informed on the
subject, or to think his ideas
through logically. Unfortunately,
his general attitude on this sub
ject is shared by many college
students.
Mr. Rankin's stand against vol
untary ROTC does not seem to
be in accord with "the indepen
dence and free thought which a
good university must encourage."
He forgets that all of the students
in Stanford ROTC units have en
rolled.of their own choice, and in
many eases this has meant a
great deal of extra work ( for 'stu
dents majoring in science or en
gineering, for example). I should
hope that most of them feel, as
I do, that this is the most respon
sible way for an intelligent and
educated citizen to fulfill his mil
itary responsibility.
The doctrine of "a big war or
a little war" is flatly contradicted
by the history of the past fifteen
years. In 1950, when we had un
questioned nuclear superiority,
our reluctance to use it involved
us in an extended ground conflict
lasting three years, in which our
air and naval superiority proved
indecisive, and our ground forces
were left to carry the burden.
Now that our nuclear capa
bility is questionable, this is al
most certain to be the situation
facing us in any future conflict.
The trained leadership provided
by the ROTC is probably our
most valuable asset in expanding
our ground forces to meet such
a war.
Since the Stanford ROTC does
not interfere seriously with Mr.
Rankin's education, one is led to
believe that he prefers not to be
reminded of the threat of war in
today's world. We are dealing
with a cold, implacable enemy,
who only understands the argu
ment of force.
His resort to other means since
the stalemate in Korea shows, I
hope, a healthy respect for the

determination of the free world
to use it, if necessary. Let us
hope that enough Americans are
willing to assume the responsi
bility of maintaining an armed
force sufficient to support the
stand of the free world against
Communism.

Mr. Rankin's editorial concern
ing ROTC in your Nov. IT issue
showed a degree of immaturity
and naivete which is unbefitting
a person holding the position of
Associate Editor of any news
paper.
One of the purposes of a uni
versity is to prepare its students
to live in the world—peacefully if
possible. History, however, has
shown that war ha's sometimes
been necessary if a country was
to protect its freedom. While I
would be the last one to advocate
war, there is nothing in history
or the world situation today
which eliminates the possibility
of war.
The next war, if there is one,
may be "big or little" as Mr. Ran
kin suggests, or it may start lit
tle and grow big. If we are to
preserve our freedom, we must
be prepared for all of these situ
ations. Any one of them will re
quire military leaders, and lead
ers are made, not born.
The modern army has become
so technical that the old "art" of
warfare has. in many respects,
become the "science" of warfare.
Leaders must be trained accord

Regarding Dr. Watkins' article,
"Deadlier Than Smog," I would
like to suggest to the learned
professor at this time that the
only truly "golden" aspect of the
present era at Stanford is the
ever-increasing tuition with
which we are all continually bur
dened. Far be it from me to criti
cize Dr. Watkins' attempt to re
vitalize the paling class of 'G4; the
attempt is noble in purpose if not
in execution.
I would, however, tacitly -sub
mit to the professor that the pros
pect either of the administration
or the student body as a whole
shouting from the roof tops, "You
can get better grades—just be
lieve in yourselves!" is not going
to comfort the average freshman
at this point, nor is it going to
convince him that grades still
aren't the primary objective.
For that is exactly what Dr.
Watkins implies when he sug
gests that every freshman "has
what it takes to make the grade
—and the grades." We just can't
escape that all-important, fact,
can we? For all the pious plati
tudes and reassurances, what it
actually comes down to is grades.
And what freshman at this point
is going to be reassured by that
fact when he knows full well he's
not cutting the mustard "grade
wise" (else why the little pink
reminders from the administra
tion. the letters from home, the
nagging self-doubt, which nearly
all of us have experienced at one
time or another since entering
these hallowed halls)?
No. I would submit to Dr. Wat

untary ROTC does not seem to
be in accord with "the indepen
dence and free thought which a
good university must encourage."
He forgets that all of the students
in Stanford ROTC units have en
rolled.of their own choice, and in
many eases this has meant a
great deal of extra work ( for 'stu
dents majoring in science or en
gineering, for example). I should
hope that most of them feel, as
I do, that this is the most respon
sible way for an intelligent and
educated citizen to fulfill his mil
itary responsibility.
The doctrine of "a big war or
a little war" is flatly contradicted
by the history of the past fifteen
years. In 1950, when we had un
questioned nuclear superiority,
our reluctance to use it involved
us in an extended ground conflict
lasting three years, in which our
air and naval superiority proved
indecisive, and our ground forces
were left to carry the burden.
Now that our nuclear capa
bility is questionable, this is al
most certain to be the situation
facing us in any future conflict.
The trained leadership provided
by the ROTC is probably our
most valuable asset in expanding
our ground forces to meet such
a war.
Since the Stanford ROTC does
not interfere seriously with Mr.
Rankin's education, one is led to
believe that he prefers not to be
reminded of the threat of war in
today's world. We are dealing
with a cold, implacable enemy,
who only understands the argu
ment of force.
His resort to other means since
the stalemate in Korea shows, I
hope, a healthy respect for the

determination of the free world
to use it, if necessary. Let us
hope that enough Americans are
willing to assume the responsi
bility of maintaining an armed
force sufficient to support the
stand of the free world against
Communism.

Mr. Rankin's editorial concern
ing ROTC in your Nov. IT issue
showed a degree of immaturity
and naivete which is unbefitting
a person holding the position of
Associate Editor of any news
paper.
One of the purposes of a uni
versity is to prepare its students
to live in the world—peacefully if
possible. History, however, has
shown that war ha's sometimes
been necessary if a country was
to protect its freedom. While I
would be the last one to advocate
war, there is nothing in history
or the world situation today
which eliminates the possibility
of war.
The next war, if there is one,
may be "big or little" as Mr. Ran
kin suggests, or it may start lit
tle and grow big. If we are to
preserve our freedom, we must
be prepared for all of these situ
ations. Any one of them will re
quire military leaders, and lead
ers are made, not born.
The modern army has become
so technical that the old "art" of
warfare has. in many respects,
become the "science" of warfare.
Leaders must be trained accord
ingly, and this cannot be done
overnight.

Regarding Dr. Watkins' article,
"Deadlier Than Smog," I would
like to suggest to the learned
professor at this time that the
only truly "golden" aspect of the
present era at Stanford is the
ever-increasing tuition with
which we are all continually bur
dened. Far be it from me to criti
cize Dr. Watkins' attempt to re
vitalize the paling class of 'G4; the
attempt is noble in purpose if not
in execution.
I would, however, tacitly -sub
mit to the professor that the pros
pect either of the administration
or the student body as a whole
shouting from the roof tops, "You
can get better grades—just be
lieve in yourselves!" is not going
to comfort the average freshman
at this point, nor is it going to
convince him that grades still
aren't the primary objective.
For that is exactly what Dr.
Watkins implies when he sug
gests that every freshman "has
what it takes to make the grade
—and the grades." We just can't
escape that all-important, fact,
can we? For all the pious plati
tudes and reassurances, what it
actually comes down to is grades.
And what freshman at this point
is going to be reassured by that
fact when he knows full well he's
not cutting the mustard "grade
wise" (else why the little pink
reminders from the administra
tion. the letters from home, the
nagging self-doubt, which nearly
all of us have experienced at one
time or another since entering
these hallowed halls)?
No. I would submit to Dr. Wat
kins that if his primary concern is
really for the peace of mind of
the average freshman (or as close
to real peace of mind as can be
attained under the present sys
tem*, that we all get down off
those roof tops and admit that
it's grades.
We all wish we could afford to
spend all of our time pursuing
"education," but at present there
are other factors involved: a 3.5
grade point if your goals include
the dean's list, a 3.0 if it's to be
a scholarship or grad school, a
2. plus for a fraternity or eating
club, etc. Set your goals, but meet
them head on. Heed not the
golden voice bespeaking "the
golden years of pioneering and
intellectual adventure," of "bold
experiment" and high ideals. It's
grades that count and you're not
going to escape them that easily
these coming four years (and

isn't it a pity, too).

Mr. Rankin's editorial concern
ing ROTC in your Nov. IT issue
showed a degree of immaturity
and naivete which is unbefitting
a person holding the position of
Associate Editor of any news
paper.
One of the purposes of a uni
versity is to prepare its students
to live in the world—peacefully if
possible. History, however, has
shown that war ha's sometimes
been necessary if a country was
to protect its freedom. While I
would be the last one to advocate
war, there is nothing in history
or the world situation today
which eliminates the possibility
of war.
The next war, if there is one,
may be "big or little" as Mr. Ran
kin suggests, or it may start lit
tle and grow big. If we are to
preserve our freedom, we must
be prepared for all of these situ
ations. Any one of them will re
quire military leaders, and lead
ers are made, not born.
The modern army has become
so technical that the old "art" of
warfare has. in many respects,
become the "science" of warfare.
Leaders must be trained accord
ingly, and this cannot be done
overnight.
John Breedlove
Editor, tin 1 Daily:
Regarding Dr. Watkins' article,
"Deadlier Than Smog," I would
like to suggest to the learned
professor at this time that the
only truly "golden" aspect of the
present era at Stanford is the
ever-increasing tuition with
which we are all continually bur
dened. Far be it from me to criti
cize Dr. Watkins' attempt to re
vitalize the paling class of 'G4; the
attempt is noble in purpose if not
in execution.
I would, however, tacitly -sub
mit to the professor that the pros
pect either of the administration
or the student body as a whole
shouting from the roof tops, "You
can get better grades—just be
lieve in yourselves!" is not going
to comfort the average freshman
at this point, nor is it going to
convince him that grades still
aren't the primary objective.
For that is exactly what Dr.
Watkins implies when he sug
gests that every freshman "has
what it takes to make the grade
—and the grades." We just can't
escape that all-important, fact,
can we? For all the pious plati
tudes and reassurances, what it
actually comes down to is grades.
And what freshman at this point
is going to be reassured by that
fact when he knows full well he's
not cutting the mustard "grade
wise" (else why the little pink
reminders from the administra
tion. the letters from home, the
nagging self-doubt, which nearly
all of us have experienced at one
time or another since entering
these hallowed halls)?
No. I would submit to Dr. Wat
kins that if his primary concern is
really for the peace of mind of
the average freshman (or as close
to real peace of mind as can be
attained under the present sys
tem*, that we all get down off
those roof tops and admit that
it's grades.
We all wish we could afford to
spend all of our time pursuing
"education," but at present there
are other factors involved: a 3.5
grade point if your goals include
the dean's list, a 3.0 if it's to be
a scholarship or grad school, a
2. plus for a fraternity or eating
club, etc. Set your goals, but meet
them head on. Heed not the
golden voice bespeaking "the
golden years of pioneering and
intellectual adventure," of "bold
experiment" and high ideals. It's
grades that count and you're not
going to escape them that easily
these coming four years (and

isn't it a pity, too).
John Bradley
Editor, the Daily:
I am rather disturbed by Mr.
Rankin's views on the ROTC. He
does not seem to have made much
effort to become informed on the
subject, or to think his ideas
through logically. Unfortunately,
his general attitude on this sub
ject is shared by many college
students.
Mr. Rankin's stand against vol
untary ROTC does not seem to
be in accord with "the indepen
dence and free thought which a
good university must encourage."
He forgets that all of the students
in Stanford ROTC units have en
rolled.of their own choice, and in
many eases this has meant a
great deal of extra work ( for 'stu
dents majoring in science or en
gineering, for example). I should
hope that most of them feel, as
I do, that this is the most respon
sible way for an intelligent and
educated citizen to fulfill his mil
itary responsibility.
The doctrine of "a big war or
a little war" is flatly contradicted
by the history of the past fifteen
years. In 1950, when we had un
questioned nuclear superiority,
our reluctance to use it involved
us in an extended ground conflict
lasting three years, in which our
air and naval superiority proved
indecisive, and our ground forces
were left to carry the burden.
Now that our nuclear capa
bility is questionable, this is al
most certain to be the situation
facing us in any future conflict.
The trained leadership provided
by the ROTC is probably our
most valuable asset in expanding
our ground forces to meet such
a war.
Since the Stanford ROTC does
not interfere seriously with Mr.
Rankin's education, one is led to
believe that he prefers not to be
reminded of the threat of war in
today's world. We are dealing
with a cold, implacable enemy,
who only understands the argu
ment of force.
His resort to other means since
the stalemate in Korea shows, I
hope, a healthy respect for the

determination of the free world
to use it, if necessary. Let us
hope that enough Americans are
willing to assume the responsi
bility of maintaining an armed
force sufficient to support the
