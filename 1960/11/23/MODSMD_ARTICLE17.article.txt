Editor, the Daily:
In spite of the saddening end
to the football season, we may all
ho certain that de-emphasis is not
in Stanford's immediate future.
Not only is student enthusiasm
on the rise, as the sparse habita
tion of Friday's classrooms at
test; the concern of the admin
istration is also increasing, as
those few who were on campus
Saturday can witness.
Obviously there were not many
of us, but we had looked forward
to a quiet weekend before the
madness (if pre-reglstration week,
a couple of days to rewrite lec
tures, to read recent publications"
in our field, to do some writing.
Certainly, the administration also
has an interest in this being done:
we must report our scholarly pro
duction yearly.
(The students also ought to
have an interest in seeing they
are not lectured to from notes
which have served for twenty
years.) But on Saturday football
came first. The library doors
were locked for the day! If we did
not want to fight traffic fumes
to see The Game, we would be
forced to do so in order to use
Berkeley's library (open as
usual), or else take an enforced
day's vacation, thus adding more
to what would have to be done
during Thanksgiving vacation's
truncated hours.
No, Rally Com, Alumni, and
Dink Templeton need not worry,
notice has been served that
scholarship will never come be
fore football at Stanford.

Once again we are deluged with
this Democratic propaganda line
of pacificism and appeasement.
War (presumably nuclear war)
is unthinkable in this age of mod
ern weapons. In your editorial of
Nov. 16, you said, "Neither Cuba
nor any other nation is worth
starting World War III over."
Am I to presume that the
United States is included in the
group of "any other nation?" Is
the generality really true that
World War III must not be
started, even to preserve our own
country? Is freedom worth fighi
ing for, or are we to fight only if
we are violently attacked from
abroad?
Your overwhelming (almost fa
natical) fear of war has affected
your good judgment, and has
caused you to overlook the funda
mental threat that the Commu
nist Party poses to this country.
Your position is one based on ig
norance of the Communist Party,
its goals, ideals, sense of morality,
and methods of operation. The
Communist Party openly states
that its only goal is to make the
entire world a Communist so
ciety.
Preferably this goal will be at
tained through peaceful means,
but the Communists do not elimi
nate violence (even WAV. Ill)
from their means by which they
will attain this goal.
Only when the purpose and
plans of the Communist Party
are recognized and understood
can this country have an effective

foreign policy which will limit
the spreading of communism. But
from your editorial, we should
not actively try to limit the
spreading of communism, we
should do it passively so as not
to give "unwanted indoctrina
tion."
I believe the people of this
country must become informed of
the real purpose of the Commu
nist movement (to make the en
,tire world communistic) and then
take action to prevent this from
happening, even if it means adopt
ing a "get-tough" foreign policy
with the world and the brink of
| World War 111.
Any other policy is simply one
| of waiting for the inevitable fall
of our society, which is based on
I individual freedom, and the es
tablishment of a communistic so
! ciety in this country.

After reading Jerry Rankin's
i opinion of ROTC in civilian col
leges, I feel that another point
of view may help to put this
training program into its proper
perspective. As a career officer
my viewpoint is understandably
biased but my opinions are my
own and are not necessarily those
of the Defense Department and,
as such, carry no official en
dorsement.
War has been, historically, an
instrument of foreign policy. As
long as it continues to be the
policy of any major world power
the world powers must adequate
ly protect themselves against this
: threat to security. Until the day
—if it ever comes—when all
powers mutually renounce war,
the United States is forced to
| maintain a combat-ready force to
protect itself from aggression.
There are four major sources
of officers for the armed serv
ices: the service academies,
ROTC, OCS, and direct appoint
ment. The service academies pro-
I vide some two thousand officers
I a year, of which the vast major
ity are career oriented, the OCS
program provides a minimum
number of officers, dii-ect ap
pointments consist mainly of
i service-type officers — doctors,
lawyers, etc. The main source of
officers is ROTC.
Ideally all people can see that
| war is not a solution to interna
j tional problems but realistically
(this just isn't the situation. That
I man should devote himself en
tirely to pursuit of peaceful edu
cation is noble, but many college
students realize the importance
of maintaining a decisive, defen
sive, force in being and wish to
serve their country as an officer
in its armed forces.
To deny the military of these
civilian-educated ROTC gradu
ates would not only result in a
critical shortage of intelligent of
ficers, but would also deprive
these individuals of the oppor
tunity to defend their nation pas
sively since they certainly must
prefer this to the active defense
j of war.

After reading Jerry Rankin's

of view may help to put this
training program into its proper
perspective. As a career officer
my viewpoint is understandably
biased but my opinions are my
own and are not necessarily those
of the Defense Department and,
as such, carry no official en
dorsement.
War has been, historically, an
instrument of foreign policy. As
long as it continues to be the
policy of any major world power
the world powers must adequate
ly protect themselves against this
: threat to security. Until the day
—if it ever comes—when all
powers mutually renounce war,
the United States is forced to
| maintain a combat-ready force to
protect itself from aggression.
There are four major sources
of officers for the armed serv
ices: the service academies,
ROTC, OCS, and direct appoint
ment. The service academies pro-
I vide some two thousand officers
I a year, of which the vast major
ity are career oriented, the OCS
program provides a minimum
number of officers, dii-ect ap
pointments consist mainly of
i service-type officers — doctors,
lawyers, etc. The main source of
officers is ROTC.
Ideally all people can see that

(this just isn't the situation. That
I man should devote himself en
tirely to pursuit of peaceful edu
cation is noble, but many college
students realize the importance
of maintaining a decisive, defen

To deny the military of these

In spite of the saddening end

Not only is student enthusiasm
on the rise, as the sparse habita

those few who were on campus
Saturday can witness.
Obviously there were not many
of us, but we had looked forward
to a quiet weekend before the
madness (if pre-reglstration week,
a couple of days to rewrite lec
tures, to read recent publications"
in our field, to do some writing.
Certainly, the administration also
has an interest in this being done:
we must report our scholarly pro
duction yearly.
(The students also ought to
have an interest in seeing they
are not lectured to from notes
which have served for twenty

came first. The library doors
were locked for the day! If we did
not want to fight traffic fumes
to see The Game, we would be
forced to do so in order to use

a couple of days to rewrite lec

Certainly, the administration also

Once again we are deluged with
this Democratic propaganda line
of pacificism and appeasement.
War (presumably nuclear war)
is unthinkable in this age of mod
ern weapons. In your editorial of
Nov. 16, you said, "Neither Cuba
nor any other nation is worth
starting World War III over."
Am I to presume that the
United States is included in the
group of "any other nation?" Is
the generality really true that
World War III must not be
started, even to preserve our own
country? Is freedom worth fighi
ing for, or are we to fight only if
we are violently attacked from
abroad?
Your overwhelming (almost fa
natical) fear of war has affected
your good judgment, and has
caused you to overlook the funda
mental threat that the Commu
nist Party poses to this country.
Your position is one based on ig
norance of the Communist Party,
its goals, ideals, sense of morality,
and methods of operation. The
Communist Party openly states
that its only goal is to make the
entire world a Communist so
ciety.
Preferably this goal will be at
tained through peaceful means,
but the Communists do not elimi
nate violence (even WAV. Ill)
from their means by which they
will attain this goal.
Only when the purpose and
plans of the Communist Party
are recognized and understood
can this country have an effective

foreign policy which will limit
the spreading of communism. But
from your editorial, we should
not actively try to limit the
spreading of communism, we
should do it passively so as not
to give "unwanted indoctrina
tion."
I believe the people of this
country must become informed of
the real purpose of the Commu
nist movement (to make the en
,tire world communistic) and then
take action to prevent this from
happening, even if it means adopt
ing a "get-tough" foreign policy
with the world and the brink of
| World War 111.
Any other policy is simply one

Once again we are deluged with
this Democratic propaganda line
of pacificism and appeasement.
War (presumably nuclear war)
is unthinkable in this age of mod
ern weapons. In your editorial of
Nov. 16, you said, "Neither Cuba
nor any other nation is worth
starting World War III over."
Am I to presume that the
United States is included in the
group of "any other nation?" Is
the generality really true that
World War III must not be
started, even to preserve our own
country? Is freedom worth fighi
ing for, or are we to fight only if
we are violently attacked from
abroad?
Your overwhelming (almost fa
natical) fear of war has affected
your good judgment, and has
caused you to overlook the funda
mental threat that the Commu
nist Party poses to this country.
Your position is one based on ig
norance of the Communist Party,
its goals, ideals, sense of morality,
and methods of operation. The
Communist Party openly states
that its only goal is to make the
entire world a Communist so
ciety.
Preferably this goal will be at
tained through peaceful means,
but the Communists do not elimi
nate violence (even WAV. Ill)
from their means by which they
will attain this goal.
Only when the purpose and
plans of the Communist Party
are recognized and understood
can this country have an effective

foreign policy which will limit
the spreading of communism. But
from your editorial, we should
not actively try to limit the
spreading of communism, we
should do it passively so as not
to give "unwanted indoctrina
tion."
I believe the people of this
country must become informed of
the real purpose of the Commu
nist movement (to make the en
,tire world communistic) and then
take action to prevent this from
happening, even if it means adopt
ing a "get-tough" foreign policy
with the world and the brink of
| World War 111.
Any other policy is simply one
| of waiting for the inevitable fall
of our society, which is based on
I individual freedom, and the es
tablishment of a communistic so
! ciety in this country.

After reading Jerry Rankin's
i opinion of ROTC in civilian col
leges, I feel that another point
of view may help to put this
training program into its proper
perspective. As a career officer
my viewpoint is understandably
biased but my opinions are my
own and are not necessarily those
of the Defense Department and,
as such, carry no official en
dorsement.
War has been, historically, an
instrument of foreign policy. As
long as it continues to be the
policy of any major world power
the world powers must adequate
ly protect themselves against this
: threat to security. Until the day
—if it ever comes—when all
powers mutually renounce war,
the United States is forced to
| maintain a combat-ready force to
protect itself from aggression.
There are four major sources
of officers for the armed serv
ices: the service academies,
ROTC, OCS, and direct appoint
ment. The service academies pro-
I vide some two thousand officers
I a year, of which the vast major
ity are career oriented, the OCS
program provides a minimum
number of officers, dii-ect ap
pointments consist mainly of
i service-type officers — doctors,
lawyers, etc. The main source of
officers is ROTC.
Ideally all people can see that
| war is not a solution to interna
j tional problems but realistically
(this just isn't the situation. That
I man should devote himself en
tirely to pursuit of peaceful edu
cation is noble, but many college
students realize the importance
of maintaining a decisive, defen
sive, force in being and wish to
serve their country as an officer
in its armed forces.
To deny the military of these
civilian-educated ROTC gradu
ates would not only result in a
critical shortage of intelligent of
ficers, but would also deprive
these individuals of the oppor
tunity to defend their nation pas
sively since they certainly must
prefer this to the active defense
j of war.

In spite of the saddening end
to the football season, we may all
ho certain that de-emphasis is not
in Stanford's immediate future.
Not only is student enthusiasm
on the rise, as the sparse habita
tion of Friday's classrooms at
test; the concern of the admin
istration is also increasing, as
those few who were on campus
Saturday can witness.
Obviously there were not many
of us, but we had looked forward
to a quiet weekend before the
madness (if pre-reglstration week,
a couple of days to rewrite lec
tures, to read recent publications"
in our field, to do some writing.
Certainly, the administration also
has an interest in this being done:
we must report our scholarly pro
duction yearly.
(The students also ought to
have an interest in seeing they
are not lectured to from notes
which have served for twenty
years.) But on Saturday football
came first. The library doors
were locked for the day! If we did
not want to fight traffic fumes
to see The Game, we would be
forced to do so in order to use
Berkeley's library (open as
usual), or else take an enforced
day's vacation, thus adding more
to what would have to be done
