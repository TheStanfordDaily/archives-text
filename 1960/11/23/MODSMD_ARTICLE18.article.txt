# Idaho, Cal Favored In West Coast Race
## 
### 
BOUNCING BACK FROM an upset win over Cal, Stanford's cross
countrymen are getting sot for the second annual West Coast Inter
collegiate cross country championships to be staged here. The 1.2
mile race starts over the Stanford golf course at 11 a.m. Saturday.
Last year Stanford finished behind the powerful Idaho Vandal

team led by Ray Hat ton and the
Vandals will be back favored
again to take the race. The Cards
finished behind Idaho's 22 points
with 28 and were ahead of UCLA
and Cal.
This year teams from Univer
sity of British Columbia, UCLA,
Fresno State, Long Beach Stale,
Whit tier. San Francisco State,
Southern Cal and others will com
pose a large and spirited run.
HATTON, whose 20:22.1 time
is second only to Max Truex on
the Stanford course, is again fa
vored to cop the individual hon
ors Saturday and lead the Van
dals to another victory. However,
he should find a lot of competi
tion from Cal's Alan Gay lord,
Stanford's Rich Klier and John
Northway and many others.
Stanford's victory over Cal saw
Klier the team's newly elected
captain lead the pack around the
Stanford grass course in 21 min
utes and six seconds, the eighth
fastest time ever run at the Farm.
Northway was right behind in
21:15 while Bill Pratt grabbed an
important fourth place behind
Bear George Linn. Robin Ruble,
Frank Wallace, Bruce Johnson,
and Dave Boore also finished well
for the Tribe in their 24-31 vic
tory over the Bears.
Probable Tribe front linemen
in the lineup will include Klier.
Northway, Pratt, Ruble and Wal
lace.
