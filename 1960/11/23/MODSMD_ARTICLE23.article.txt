NEW YORK (UPl)—The Am
erican League, in a compromise
proposition, announced last night
it would defer entering Los An
geles until 1962, provided that the
National League would agree to
9-club inter-league competition in
1961.
American League officials thus
tossed the gauntlet to the Na
tional League, which had laid
down a set of conditions under
which the A.L. could enter Los
Angeles for the 1961 season.
The National League was given
until Dec. 5 to reach a decision
whether it would agree to 9-club
inter-league play next season.
IF IT DOIOS, Joe McKenney.
the American League's director of
publicity, stressed that the inter
league competition would be for
one year only and that one of the
new N.L. franchises -either Hous

ton or Now York would have to
he activated next year rather than
in 1962, as had originally been
planned.
Walter O'Malley, president of
the Los Angeles Dodgers, set
down the conditions under which
he would consent to allow an
American League club in Los An
geles earlier in the day.
American League officials then
went into a meeting with Presi
dent Joe Cronin and following 3 1 !'
hours of discussion, McKenney
came out with the following reso
lution, as passed by A.L. owners:
"Resolved that the American
League reforms its expansion pol
icy to have a new club in Los An
geles in 1961.
"IX the event the N.L. will
agree to 9-club interleague play
in 1961 by not. later than Dec. 5,
I960, then the American League :

will defer the granting of a new
member in Los Angeles until
1962."
Shortly after the resolution was
made, the American League sum
moned the three Los Angeles
franchise-seekers into the room
where they had met most of the
day.
The three men were: Charles
Fin ley, a 42-year-old Chicago in
surance executive; Kenyon
Brown, former Detroit Tigers
stockholder from Los Angeles,
and Gene Klein, vice chairman of
the National Theater and Televi
sion Inc.
IT MARKED an encore for Fin
ley. who had made his presenta

last week.
Brown sold his interest in the
Tigers to current president John
Fetzer a month ago and now is
associated with several movie fig
ures in an effort to obtain an A.L.
club for Los Angeles.

to enter negotiations for purchase
