# Allaway Sees Relief Work in WUS Travels
## 
### JIM PYLKAS 
Dr. William Ailaway, Assistant Dean of Men and faculty adviser
to World University Service, has traveled widely and worked exten
sively for WIJS and other relief organizations.
"However," he says,"I didn't grasp the real significance of WUS
until I faced a group of students in a T.B. sanitarium in Switzerland
whose lives depended on the medical care provided by WUS. Talking
to them and realizing that they were being made whole to return to
their respective countries to study made my effort worthwhile."
After World War 11. while an undergraduate at the University
of Illinois, Dr. Ailaway became interested in the activities of WUS.
After participating in a WUS fund-raising drive there, he was chosen
to travel around the U.S. for WUS. In order to do so, he took an

entire semester out of school.
During his nationwide tour that
semester, he spoke to university
and civic organizations on the pri
mary functions of WUS: aid to
students in underdeveloped coun
tries and aid to student refugees
the world over.
WHILH studying in Austria in
1951, Dr. Ailaway informally
helped in a Refugee Student Cen
ter at Insbrook. This center main
tained a soup kitchen for stu
dents, serving them one meal a
day. Reports Dr. Ailaway, "Often
this was the only food they had
all day." Besides this, they lived
in huts with newspaper-covered
windows. We (WUS) supplied
them with firewood for their
stoves."
Soon thereafter, he joined the
staff of WUS in Salzburg. While
working there he aided in pro
cessing student refugees for
scholarships which would enable
them to continue their studies.
Typical of the occurrences that
took place at that WUS office is
the following, which happened to
Dr. Ailaway: "I looked out the
window one afternoon and saw a
half dozen young men in the
cou r t yar d. Upon questioning
them, 1 learned that all six were
members of a Yugoslavian water
polo team which had been in Aus
tria for a game. Each of the six
had decided separately to run
away and become a refugee." Dr.
Ailaway was the first American
to meet them; he provided them
with food and a place to stay and
began their processing.
AMONG his many other experi
ences with WUS, Dr. Ailaway
represented WUS at the Consti
tutional Convention of the Inter
national Association of Universi
ties at Nice, France. He also rep
resented WUS at a consultation
of international non-governmen
tal organizations under the spon
sorship of UNESCO.

After participating in a WUS fund-raising drive there, he was chosen
to travel around the U.S. for WUS. In order to do so, he took an

entire semester out of school.
During his nationwide tour that
semester, he spoke to university
and civic organizations on the pri
mary functions of WUS: aid to
students in underdeveloped coun
tries and aid to student refugees
the world over.
WHILH studying in Austria in
1951, Dr. Ailaway informally
helped in a Refugee Student Cen
ter at Insbrook. This center main
tained a soup kitchen for stu
dents, serving them one meal a
day. Reports Dr. Ailaway, "Often
this was the only food they had
all day." Besides this, they lived
in huts with newspaper-covered
windows. We (WUS) supplied
them with firewood for their
stoves."
Soon thereafter, he joined the
staff of WUS in Salzburg. While
working there he aided in pro
cessing student refugees for
scholarships which would enable
them to continue their studies.
Typical of the occurrences that
took place at that WUS office is
the following, which happened to
Dr. Ailaway: "I looked out the
window one afternoon and saw a
half dozen young men in the
cou r t yar d. Upon questioning
them, 1 learned that all six were
members of a Yugoslavian water
polo team which had been in Aus
tria for a game. Each of the six
had decided separately to run
away and become a refugee." Dr.
Ailaway was the first American
to meet them; he provided them
with food and a place to stay and
began their processing.
AMONG his many other experi
ences with WUS, Dr. Ailaway
represented WUS at the Consti
tutional Convention of the Inter
national Association of Universi
ties at Nice, France. He also rep
resented WUS at a consultation
of international non-governmen
tal organizations under the spon
sorship of UNESCO.
Dr. William Ailaway, Assistant Dean of Men and faculty adviser
to World University Service, has traveled widely and worked exten
sively for WIJS and other relief organizations.
"However," he says,"I didn't grasp the real significance of WUS
until I faced a group of students in a T.B. sanitarium in Switzerland
whose lives depended on the medical care provided by WUS. Talking
to them and realizing that they were being made whole to return to
their respective countries to study made my effort worthwhile."
After World War 11. while an undergraduate at the University
of Illinois, Dr. Ailaway became interested in the activities of WUS.
