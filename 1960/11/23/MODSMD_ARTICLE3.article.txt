### DIANE FOSTER 
"We are faced with the total
challenge fro m communismâ€”
economically, philosophically, ed
ucationally. and psychologically,"
concluded FBI Chief Inspector
William C. Sullivan in his talk on
"Challenges of Communism" last
night.
HE ALSO warned a capacity
Dinkelspiel audience that the
"social ferment" in the world
today "tends to increase chances
of Communist success, unless we
develope better ideas of change.
"Communism has four powers
with which we have not coped."
he said. These powers are to at
tract, organize, control, and ex
pand.
Sullivan believes there is a defi
nite relationship between com
munism and educational institu
tions. That is, "tremendous con
tributions can be made by stu
dents and educators" toward solv
ing the Communist problem, "be
cause major problems must be
first solved in the academic world
before they can be applied in the
practical world."
UK SAII) HE does not think the
solution to communism can be
found in books, investigations,
legislation, defense, or in politics.
"Where it might be found is
where it started in the thinking
of men and women," he said.
"Communism is much more than
a political institution; it is a way
of life."
Sullivan ended his speech by
declaring that the "faith of de
mocracy is that the universities
will produce enough young people
with a set of convictions and defi
nite principles to meet these chal
lenges of democracy."
