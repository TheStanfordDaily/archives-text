# Teachers to Go Unpaid In Louisiana
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS < UPI > — The
superintendent of New Orleans'
newly-integrated schools yester
day had to ask his teachers to
work for free because he can't
get the money to pay them.
School Superintendent Dr.
James F. Redmond announced
yesterday that the $2 million pay
roll due today to 4,500 employes
mostly teachers- must be with
held" indefinitely.
REDMOND said the only hope
was that Gov. Jimmie Davis
would "rise above the noisy emo
tions" of state legislators and re
lease state funds to keep the
city's school system running.
The state legislature, so dis
gruntled over integration of two
elementary schools by four Negro
girls that it has tried repeatedly
to fire Redmond and the school
board, meets again today. It will
reportedly consider giving the
school board enough money to
pay the teachers, but it was ex
pected to have strings attached.
ONE REPORT was that a bill
would be introduced to pay the
teachers, providing they refuse
to teach integrated classes.
The schools are empty this
week for teacher's conventions in
Baton Rouge and the Thanks
giving holiday. The school board
is still awaiting a Federal Court
ruling on its motion to halt inte
gration while the state and fed
eral governments settle their
struggle over- sovereignty.
THE BOARD also has mount
ing bills for food and other •sup
plies that it cannot pay.
"As of this moment, banks can
be of no assistance," Redmond
said. School officials said earlier
that banks were balking at issu
ing the customary loans because
they couldn't be sure who is run
ning the schools. The school
board, in effect, has been running
the schools, but the state insists
it has fired the board and it is
running the schools.
