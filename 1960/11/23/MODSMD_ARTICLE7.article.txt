### ROSS HERMANN 
From information supplied by
Dr. Ronald Hilton, director of Hie
Stanford Institute of Hispanic-
American Studies, "The Nation"
magazine concludes in a recent
editorial that Fidel Castro has
good reason to fear a U.S.-fi
nanced invasion of his country
from Guatemala.
THK KDITORIAL quoting Hil
ton appeared in the Nov. 1 1 issue
of the liberal weekly publication
and was entitled "Are We Train
ing Cuban Guerillas?" The edi
torial was based upon reports by
Hilton contained in this month's
edition of the Hispanic-American
Report.
Hilton, who returned from a
visit to Guatemala recently,
learned while he was in tha coun
try thai the U.S. Central Intel
ligence Agency has acquired a
large tract of land, at an outlay
of $1,000,000. which is heavily
guarded and surrounded by a
.stout fence.
Hilton also learned from Guate
malan sources that it is "common
knowledge" that the tract is being
used a,< a lr;iininL r it round for

Cuba n counter - revolutionaries
who are preparing for an even
tual attack on Cuba. U.S. person
nel and equipment are also sup
posedly being used on the base.
IN AN INTKRVIKW with the
Daily yesterday, Hilton said that
his sources of information in
clude "responsible correspondents
in Guatemala and an American
close to the Guatemalan govern
ment."
Hilton saifl further that the
bulk of the people at the tract are
Cuban exiles eager to fight Cas
tro and thai the United States is
currently exporting soldiers of
fortune from Florida to Guate
mala for I raining.
So far a cloak of secrecy has
surrounded I he matter for both
the United States and Guate
malan government have refused
to discuss the matter.
The editorial In "The Nation"
gave the chief source of informa
tion about I he base as Clemente
Marroquin Roj;is, director of Ihe
Guatemalan n e w s p a p e r. "La
Ilora." A report he published on
the mater appeared in violation

of a government prohibition
against public discussion of the
subject.
RKCKNTLV President Ydi
goras, forced to take cognizance
of Ihe matter, went on TV and
admitted the existence of the
| tract but did not disclose its pur
j pose or anything about it.
Also in yesterday's interview.
Hilton repeated that it would in
deed be a black day in hemis
pheric relations if the United
States were to directly or indi
rectly attack Cuba.
He said that even though many
Latin American countries have
little sympathy with Castro, they
i would bo likely to side with Cuba
' if it were invaded because that
country is one of them. Such ac
; tion against Cuba, he said, would
I weaken the position of this coun
try throughout Latin America.
Hilton also expressed concern
about the inadequacies of the
j American press in that the suh-
I ject has not yet reached the pub
! lie on a large scale. Hilton will
appear on television, Channel 2
and 4. on Sunday aflernon to pre

good reason to fear a U.S.-fi
nanced invasion of his country
from Guatemala.
THK KDITORIAL quoting Hil
ton appeared in the Nov. 1 1 issue
of the liberal weekly publication
and was entitled "Are We Train
ing Cuban Guerillas?" The edi
torial was based upon reports by
Hilton contained in this month's
edition of the Hispanic-American
Report.
Hilton, who returned from a
visit to Guatemala recently,
learned while he was in tha coun
try thai the U.S. Central Intel
ligence Agency has acquired a
large tract of land, at an outlay
of $1,000,000. which is heavily
guarded and surrounded by a
.stout fence.
Hilton also learned from Guate
malan sources that it is "common
knowledge" that the tract is being
used a,< a lr;iininL r it round for

Cuba n counter - revolutionaries
who are preparing for an even
tual attack on Cuba. U.S. person
nel and equipment are also sup
posedly being used on the base.
IN AN INTKRVIKW with the
Daily yesterday, Hilton said that
his sources of information in
clude "responsible correspondents
in Guatemala and an American
close to the Guatemalan govern
ment."
Hilton saifl further that the
bulk of the people at the tract are
Cuban exiles eager to fight Cas
tro and thai the United States is
currently exporting soldiers of
fortune from Florida to Guate
mala for I raining.
So far a cloak of secrecy has
surrounded I he matter for both
the United States and Guate
malan government have refused
to discuss the matter.
The editorial In "The Nation"
gave the chief source of informa
tion about I he base as Clemente
Marroquin Roj;is, director of Ihe
Guatemalan n e w s p a p e r. "La
Ilora." A report he published on
the mater appeared in violation

of a government prohibition
against public discussion of the
subject.
RKCKNTLV President Ydi
goras, forced to take cognizance
of Ihe matter, went on TV and
admitted the existence of the
| tract but did not disclose its pur
j pose or anything about it.
Also in yesterday's interview.
Hilton repeated that it would in
deed be a black day in hemis
pheric relations if the United
States were to directly or indi
rectly attack Cuba.
He said that even though many
Latin American countries have
little sympathy with Castro, they
i would bo likely to side with Cuba
' if it were invaded because that
country is one of them. Such ac
; tion against Cuba, he said, would
I weaken the position of this coun
try throughout Latin America.
Hilton also expressed concern
about the inadequacies of the
