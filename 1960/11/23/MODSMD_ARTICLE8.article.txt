# Obscure Facts of Turkey Tradition Come to Light
## 
### SONYA MICHEL 
An interesting view on the first Thanksgiving, celebrated 340
years ago by our Puritan ancestors, was given the other day by
Dr. John Miller of the History Department.
II seems thai our Puritan forefathers were not the first English
men to cat a turkey dinner. As a matter of fact, that fine fowl

had been sustaining Britishers
from as far back as the 16th cen
tury, when the turkey was first
introduced. There had been a
turkey farm near the Pilgrims'
stronghold in England.
"IT WASN'T a rare bird at
all," Miller explained.
The Pilgrims' motives for cele
brating Thanksgiving included, of
course, the matter of being grate
ful for plentiful crops and the
prospect of a comfortable winter.
"But," Miller said, "they were
also vehemently opposed to
Christmas and other Christian
holidays reminiscent of supersti
tion.
"THERE WERE more fast days
than feast days in early New Eng
land," he went on. "We who have
both Christmas and Thanksgiving
are the gainers by this Puritan
custom."
For the turkeys, however,
Thanksgiving was a day of "bad
omen." Although deer meat was
also included in the menu, the
popularity of wild turkey was re
sponsible for its being the first
native American bird to become
extinct.
THESE SETTLERS displayed
their spirit of thanksgiving with
| gay dances around the Maypole,
I and diversions provided by glam-
I orous Indian girls, who rose to
! the occasion by daubing them
i selves generously wit h bear-
I grease.
Their festivities reminded the
j Puritans not too favorably of the
I Old England from which they
j had come away. It was this sort
I of stuffiness that led to mass op
position to Thanksgiving as late
|as the 19th century. It seemed
| that Americans didn't want a
i holiday to celebrate "Puritan big
] ot I V."
DURING TIIE Revolutionary
War, the Continental Congress
| urged the states to observe
i Thanksgiving for such blessings
: as the French alliance, and vic
tories won during the year,
j It wasn't until 1864 that the
holiday was first proclaimed na
; tionwide by President Lincoln.
The idea of rejoicing over good
harvests has been altered some
what over the years. Ironically,
| Miller said, "in view of the tre
mendous glut of our harvests to
day, it might be belter not to have
| such good crops."

HISTORY PROF. MILLER RELATES AMERICAN TRADITION
Leaning back in comfort like a story-teller of old, Miller re
lates to Daily reporter the history of the evolution of the
turkey, from its puritanical beginnings clown to the present.
An interesting view on the first Thanksgiving, celebrated 340
years ago by our Puritan ancestors, was given the other day by
Dr. John Miller of the History Department.
II seems thai our Puritan forefathers were not the first English
men to cat a turkey dinner. As a matter of fact, that fine fowl

had been sustaining Britishers
from as far back as the 16th cen
tury, when the turkey was first
introduced. There had been a
turkey farm near the Pilgrims'
stronghold in England.
"IT WASN'T a rare bird at
all," Miller explained.
The Pilgrims' motives for cele
brating Thanksgiving included, of
course, the matter of being grate
ful for plentiful crops and the
prospect of a comfortable winter.
"But," Miller said, "they were
also vehemently opposed to
Christmas and other Christian
holidays reminiscent of supersti
tion.
"THERE WERE more fast days
than feast days in early New Eng
land," he went on. "We who have
both Christmas and Thanksgiving
are the gainers by this Puritan
custom."
For the turkeys, however,
Thanksgiving was a day of "bad
omen." Although deer meat was
also included in the menu, the
popularity of wild turkey was re
sponsible for its being the first
native American bird to become
extinct.
THESE SETTLERS displayed
their spirit of thanksgiving with
| gay dances around the Maypole,
I and diversions provided by glam-
I orous Indian girls, who rose to
! the occasion by daubing them
i selves generously wit h bear-
I grease.
Their festivities reminded the
j Puritans not too favorably of the
I Old England from which they
j had come away. It was this sort
I of stuffiness that led to mass op
position to Thanksgiving as late
|as the 19th century. It seemed
| that Americans didn't want a
i holiday to celebrate "Puritan big
] ot I V."
