# COP Remodels Along Oxford-Type Lines
## 
### 
The president of the College of Pacific has announced plans to
convert COP into a university modeled on England's Oxford.
According to Robert E. Burns the present College of Pacific will
remain as a liberal arts college but small colleges will be added one
bv one. in a svstem patterned after the ancient English University.

THE MOVE will involve ex
panding the campus from 50
acres to 117 and renaming the
whole institution the University
of Pacific.
The colleges will have a limit
of 250 students with a ratio of
one teacher per 20 students. The
new plan includes a restriction on
extra-curricular activities and a
ban on fraternities and sororities.
Students will live in dormitories
holding 64 each.
A strong intramural athletics
program will be organized among
the colleges. Individual students
| will still be able to participate in
j university athletics, however.
THE NEW program also in
i eludes an absence of vocational
-1 ism or specialties and re-organ
i ization of the curriculum along
| divisional rather than the tradi
tional departmental lines.
For example, instead of having
| separate chemistry and physics
j departments, the new system will
include them under one division
called natural sciences.
According to Burns, there will
be four other divisions: Commun
ications, social science, human
ities and personal development.
GROUNDBREAKING for the
first of the new colleges is slated
for February, a month after the
110 th anniversary of COP, the
oldest college in California.
Other colleges will be added
I "as needs dictates and finances
I become available" said Burns.
I The first new college will be
! named Raymond College and will
be completed by September of
1962.
In the "Oxford" plans, the pres
: ent College of Pacific will con
i tinue much as it is today. The
| enrollment will remain limited to
1,750 and it will continue to
I award master's and doctor's de
| grees.
STUDENTS in the new colleges
j will take only three courses each
semester, of five units each. Grad
uation will be based on achieve
ment standards for the four years
as well as number of units com
i pie ted.
"Limiting the colleges to 250
j students each will afford a com
mon bond of association such as
exists among those in the dif
ferent colleges at Oxford," Burns
I said.
"WE HOPE the close relation
ship between professor and stu-
I dent will greatly stimulate the in
' tellectual life through the free
] and intimate exchange of ideas.
"The new University of Pacific
will not be a carbon copy of the
expanding of the state college
system," Burns continued. "We
will provide something different.
"We hope the novel program
I will produce outstanding busi
ness. educational, political, and
religious leaders by combining
some of the best qualities of the
old English system with newer
I American ideas."

I said.
"WE HOPE the close relation

The president of the College of Pacific has announced plans to
convert COP into a university modeled on England's Oxford.
According to Robert E. Burns the present College of Pacific will
remain as a liberal arts college but small colleges will be added one
bv one. in a svstem patterned after the ancient English University.

THE MOVE will involve ex
panding the campus from 50
acres to 117 and renaming the
whole institution the University
of Pacific.
The colleges will have a limit
of 250 students with a ratio of
one teacher per 20 students. The
new plan includes a restriction on
extra-curricular activities and a
ban on fraternities and sororities.
Students will live in dormitories
holding 64 each.
A strong intramural athletics
program will be organized among
the colleges. Individual students
| will still be able to participate in
j university athletics, however.
THE NEW program also in
i eludes an absence of vocational
-1 ism or specialties and re-organ
i ization of the curriculum along
| divisional rather than the tradi
tional departmental lines.
For example, instead of having
| separate chemistry and physics
j departments, the new system will
include them under one division
called natural sciences.
According to Burns, there will
be four other divisions: Commun
ications, social science, human
ities and personal development.
GROUNDBREAKING for the
first of the new colleges is slated
for February, a month after the
110 th anniversary of COP, the
oldest college in California.
Other colleges will be added
I "as needs dictates and finances
I become available" said Burns.
I The first new college will be
! named Raymond College and will
be completed by September of
1962.
In the "Oxford" plans, the pres
: ent College of Pacific will con
i tinue much as it is today. The
| enrollment will remain limited to
1,750 and it will continue to
I award master's and doctor's de
| grees.
STUDENTS in the new colleges
j will take only three courses each
semester, of five units each. Grad
uation will be based on achieve
ment standards for the four years
as well as number of units com
i pie ted.
