# LA. SEGREGATION CRISIS
## Legislator Proposes Naming New Electors 
### 
BATON ROUGE. La. (UPI»-
A North Louisiana legislator last
night proposed suspending the
state's election laws in order to
permit the state legislature to ap
point new electors to cast Louisi
ana's vote in the presidential elec
toral congress.
The Legislature, resuming a
second emergency session called
by Gov. Jimmie H. Davis to block
federal moves to integrate New
Orleans schools, adjourned im
mediately after the resolution
was introduced in the House by
Rep. Parey Branton of Webster
Parish.
Branton's resolution points out
that the U.S. Constitution pro
vides that a state's electors may
be appointed "in such a manner
as the Legislature may direct,"
and that the state constitution
grants the Legislature power to
suspend state laws.
SEN. HOWARD M. Jones, au
thor of a similar resolution he
had promised to introduce in the
Senate merely asking Louisi
ana's 10 Democratic electors not
to vote for John F. Kennedy -was
called into Gov. Jimmie H. Davis'
office last night and emerged say
ing he would not introduce his
resolution.
However, ho said later he
would introduce it today.
The House unanmously adopted
two other resolutions backed by

Davis and aimed at the state's in
terposition strategy, which re
fuses to recognize federal au
thority.
One asked the state's Congres
sional delegation to propose an
amendment to the U.S. Constitu
tion to clarify terms of federal
control of public schools.
The other asked for a Consti
tutional convention to amend and
revise the entire U.S. Constitu
tion.
J BRANTOVS resolution also
j orders the secretary of state not
to officially publish results of
Louisiana's vote in the Nov. 8
presidential election. This provi
sion was doomed for failure, how
ever. The election returns were
scheduled for publication today—
before action can be taken on the
resolution.
Reaction to the proposals to
tamper with Louisiana's electors
by other state legislators was
cautious.
"Unless Louisiana was the
! swing state, and our electoral
| votes would decide whether Ken
nedy receives a majority (of the
I electoral college* there'd be no
: point in tampering with them,"
| one representative said.
