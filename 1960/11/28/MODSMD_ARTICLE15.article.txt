On October 24th I lie Daily proposed the formulation of a
Marxism-Leninism course at Stanford which would give upper
classmen an insight into the motivations and machinations of the
ideology which now encompasses better than one-thin! of the
world.
Judging from the dearth of letters, most students apparently
don't consider the proposal worthy of their consideration. The
proposal, however, did receive, some support from the Institute
of International Relations. A committee was formed which con
ducted an investigation among faculty members and the admin
istration to discover their opinions on such a course.
I he investigation was partially concerned with a compilation
of courses already available which deal with Communism —its
theory and practice. There are several courses which d»> touch
upon Communism but only as a small part of a much larger topic.
The basic outline of tlie course proposed to faculty members
was as follows: a survey of Marxist-Leninist theory; its revisions
and applications today: the sociological, psychological, and eco
nomic aspects of contemporary Communism; a comparison of the
basic tenets of Communism to the basic tenets of Democracy.
Several faculty members of tlie Social Science and Humanities
departments enthusiastically supported such a course. They were
opposed to the compulsory nature of the course since there are
already too many required courses.
They felt that such a course, numbered below 100. should be
offered to interested Sophomores and Juniors, hut not be required.
'I his course could become a pre-requisite for upper di\ ision courses
on Communism, enabling these courses to delve more deeply into
the subject since the basic material would already have been
covered.
The Daily's proposal was premised on the belief that the best
way to combat Communism is to understand Communism. Amer
icans are woefully ignorant on this dynamic philosophy. \o per
son who knows what Communism is trying to accomplish and how
Communism intends to accomplish it can smugly sit back and con
sider himself secure.
If enough student support is indicated such a course as indi
cated above could be instituted. Interested students can contact
The Daily or the 11H Shack. Suggestions and criticism are encour
aged.

On October 24th I lie Daily proposed the formulation of a
Marxism-Leninism course at Stanford which would give upper
classmen an insight into the motivations and machinations of the
ideology which now encompasses better than one-thin! of the
world.
Judging from the dearth of letters, most students apparently
don't consider the proposal worthy of their consideration. The
proposal, however, did receive, some support from the Institute
of International Relations. A committee was formed which con
ducted an investigation among faculty members and the admin
istration to discover their opinions on such a course.
I he investigation was partially concerned with a compilation
of courses already available which deal with Communism —its
theory and practice. There are several courses which d»> touch
upon Communism but only as a small part of a much larger topic.
The basic outline of tlie course proposed to faculty members
was as follows: a survey of Marxist-Leninist theory; its revisions
and applications today: the sociological, psychological, and eco
nomic aspects of contemporary Communism; a comparison of the
basic tenets of Communism to the basic tenets of Democracy.
Several faculty members of tlie Social Science and Humanities
departments enthusiastically supported such a course. They were
opposed to the compulsory nature of the course since there are
already too many required courses.
They felt that such a course, numbered below 100. should be
offered to interested Sophomores and Juniors, hut not be required.
'I his course could become a pre-requisite for upper di\ ision courses
on Communism, enabling these courses to delve more deeply into
the subject since the basic material would already have been
covered.
The Daily's proposal was premised on the belief that the best
way to combat Communism is to understand Communism. Amer
icans are woefully ignorant on this dynamic philosophy. \o per
son who knows what Communism is trying to accomplish and how
Communism intends to accomplish it can smugly sit back and con
sider himself secure.
If enough student support is indicated such a course as indi
cated above could be instituted. Interested students can contact
The Daily or the 11H Shack. Suggestions and criticism are encour
aged.
