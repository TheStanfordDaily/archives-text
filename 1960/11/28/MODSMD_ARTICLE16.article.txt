BY PETER DI JIG NAN
The Union of South Africa has
in the past few years become
"World Public Enemy Number
One" (a role reserved for the "Un
speakable Turk" in the nineteenth
century).
While I have absolutely no
sympathy with apartheid either
morally and socially in its Prot
estant exclusivism or economic
ally and politically in its refusal
to use to the fullest the resources
of all its people, still many critics
of South Africa have allowed
their emotions to cloud their
judgments. The result is some
very loose thinking about the Na
tionalist regime. The most dan
gerous conception is that revolu
tion is about to cast the whites
from power.
It is a grave mistake to assume
that the Union of South Africa
will soon be smashed by internal
rebellion or foreign invasion. It
is more than a grave mistake, it
is a tragedy, for it encourages
Africans to engage in unequal
trials of strength with the govern
ment and leads them to believe
that other African states can give
"rebels" significant assistance.
There is very little justification
for speaking in terms of a revo
lutionary outbreak in Cape Town
or Johannesburg which convul
sion is supposed to touch off a
continental human earthquake.
South Africa, with by far the
most mature economy, the most
highly integrated industrial ap
paratus, and the strongest state
machinery in Africa, is further
removed from a revolutionary
situation than any other part of
the Continent.
There will be riots and blood
shed; but nowhere are conditions
less suitable for a sustained rising
than in the land of Verwoerd, and
this is a political fact that no
American statesman should, and
no Russian statesman ever would
ignore. (The Communist Party in
Africa does not preach revolu
tion, it calls for accommodation.)
The myth of a spontaneous re-1

volt setting off other risings in
Africa is based on a misreading
of history. It shows a misunder
standing of the way revolutions
are made. The vision of the levee
en masse, of a nation spontane
ously casting off its chains, was
after all a piece of French revo
lutionary war propaganda.
This is hardly the way power is
sei7. e d. Revolutions must be
planned, they require organiza
tion and carefully trained cadres.
Before the first shot is fired,
there must already be successful
infiltration into all the positions
of power, whether military, ad
ministrative or economic.
The state machinery must have
been fatally weakened, either by
foreign war or complete internal
decay. Numbers or a sense of
grievance, in fact, play only a
very small part. Like it or not,
none of these conditions applies
in the Union of South Africa.
The Union Government is nei
ther weak nor seriously divided.
To counter black nationalism the
Europeans have the strong Cal
vinistic ideology of inequality and
white superiority. South Africa's
armed forces and administration
are l>oth loyal and reasonably ef
ficient. Its economy is expanding
rapidly.
As regards the African revolu
tionary, he has no friendly base
from which to operate like the Al
gerians, he cannot control the
towns; he does not hold any key
position in industry, the police,
the administration or the armed
forces. Above all, he lacks organ
ization and disciplined leadership.
To argue, as Anthony Sampson
or John Cookson or Father Hud
dleston do, that things cannot go
on as they are in the Union, and
that Africans must revolt, is just
wishful thinking.
If active rebellion is foolhardy
(for the present), organized pas
sive resistance is absurd. Satya
graha worked for Indians against
the British; it won't necessarily
work in other cultures.
Is it conceivable that passive
resistance would have saved the
Jens from Hitler? Few Afrikaner
policemen will withhold their fire
because a demonstration is peace
ful. Remember, the judge who
sentenced Gandhi apologized; the
Blacks at Sharpsville were shot
' â€”mostly in the back.

Letters to the Editor should not
exceed 250 words. Name, address
and phone number should be in
cluded. Typewritten letters have
a better chance of appearing. Let
ters shall be printed without
change except in the case of po
tentially libelous material. The
fact that any letters hold an op
posite viewpoint from the Edi
torial Board will not matter.
