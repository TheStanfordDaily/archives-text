Editor, Ihe Daily:
Each year the ASSU sponsors
the World University Service
Drive. WUS is the direct descend
ant of a relief organization set up
in Europe after World War I. It
has now spread throughout the
world. The work of its 41 Na
tional Committees is coordinated
at the international level by the
General Assembly with head
quarters and permanent staff in
Geneva.
The light against poverty, di
sease, ignorance and despair is
the task of WUS in the inter
national community of students
and professors.
As members of this university
community we can aid in the
j hope for peace and understanding
by responding generously this
week to the WUS Drive. I sin
cerely hope that we as Stanford
students are aware enough of the
need to enable us to surpass our
goal of "a dollar a scalp."
Larry Royse
ASSU President
Editor, the Daily:
I protest the cruel jest perpe
trated by the author of "Deadlier
Than Smog" (Daily, Nov. 22). By
attributing it to a member of the
faculty he has ridiculed a dis
tinguished colleague and, by ex
tension, all the rest of us. I can
not. understand how you were
taken in. A quick reading should
have warned you that no Stan
ford Professor could be responsi
j ble for such vacuous bathos.
John Henry Merryman
Professor of Law
(Dear Professor Merrynian:
The Daily thanks you for your
opinion of Mr. Watkins' article,
but in case someone mistakes
your cynicism for fact, the article
entitled "Deadlier Than Smog"
was written by Dr. Watkins.
Furthermore, perhaps the fact
that you have no direct connec
tion with the undergraduate divi
sion somewhat disqualifies you
from casting dispersions on a fac
ulty member who does have a
connection with the undergrad
uate division and is therefore in
a better position to understand
the situation —Editor.)
Editor, the Daily:
As a member of the Class of
1964, I viewed with special inter
est Professor Watkins' article in
Tuesday's Daily challenging my
class to get an education at Stan
ford notwithstanding the pres
sures of grades, and the subse
quent reply of John Bradley in
Wednesday's Daily pointing out
the impossibility of escaping the
grading system.
I share both Mr. Watkins' de
sire that "education" lake place
at Stanford for its own sake, and
Mr. Bradley's recognition that,
realistically, grades must con
tinue to remain uppermost in the
minds of all.
I am sure there are some stu
dents at Stanford who desire to
be "educated" and at the same
time be able to receive suitable
recognition of academic achieve
ment in the form of good grades.
I think that quite obviously the
blame for the present poor situa
tion must be placed upon the
somewhat bowed shoulders of the
faculty of this University: only
they can in any way alter the de
gree to which grades reflect the
success of the learning process.
With the realization that the
rectification of the existent in
verted sense of values is a very
difficult task, and that this sense
of values is a fairly old institu
tion, I challenge ihe intelligent
and mature faculty of this Uni
versity to initiate a system of
grading which measures not abil- !
ity to cram for exams, but the
actual learning taking place.
Terry Foreman
Editor, the Daily:
This is in reply to your editorial
entitled "On the Brink" criticizing
Senator Goldwater's recent for
eign policy recommendations. 1 i

| shall restrict my consideration to
the first two sentences of the sec
ond paragraph.
The first sentence asserts that
the senator's tactics fail to take
into account the existing power
balance. The second sentence tai
lors the truth to imply that the
first sentence has foundation. It
erroneously says that the assump
tion has been made that the U.S.
alone is a great power. There do
exist other great powers, but it is
evident that, at least for now, we
are the most powerful, a fact the
Communists accept.
For instance, there was one
major reason the Red Chinese
dared enter the Korean conflict
after we had nearly cleaned up
the whole peninsula. They knew
that McArthur would not be al
lowed to attack the mainland.
Also, consider the Chinese Com-

I munist assault on the contro
! versial offshore islands. The Com-
I munists were confident we would
I back down. However, Congress
1 passed a resolution affirming the
president's authority to use the
Seventh Fleet and, if necessary,
to wage a war in defense of the
islands. Not only was the shelling
stopped bill "peaceful coexist
ence" became the Communist
theme song. The Communist have
nothing to gain by a war, yet.
They are afraid of it and our
; power to wage it.
The technique, exemplified by
your editorial, of using truths,
half truths, vague implications
and false assumptions, all stirred
in together, is common among
those of liberal persuasion. It is
: quick. It sounds nice. But it
breaks down under analysis.

I protest the cruel jest perpe
trated by the author of "Deadlier
Than Smog" (Daily, Nov. 22). By
attributing it to a member of the
faculty he has ridiculed a dis
tinguished colleague and, by ex
tension, all the rest of us. I can
not. understand how you were
taken in. A quick reading should
have warned you that no Stan
ford Professor could be responsi
j ble for such vacuous bathos.
John Henry Merryman

(Dear Professor Merrynian:
The Daily thanks you for your
opinion of Mr. Watkins' article,
but in case someone mistakes
your cynicism for fact, the article
entitled "Deadlier Than Smog"
was written by Dr. Watkins.
Furthermore, perhaps the fact
that you have no direct connec
tion with the undergraduate divi
sion somewhat disqualifies you
from casting dispersions on a fac
ulty member who does have a
connection with the undergrad
uate division and is therefore in
a better position to understand
the situation —Editor.)
Editor, the Daily:
As a member of the Class of
1964, I viewed with special inter
est Professor Watkins' article in
Tuesday's Daily challenging my
class to get an education at Stan
ford notwithstanding the pres
sures of grades, and the subse
quent reply of John Bradley in
Wednesday's Daily pointing out
the impossibility of escaping the
grading system.
I share both Mr. Watkins' de
sire that "education" lake place
at Stanford for its own sake, and
Mr. Bradley's recognition that,
realistically, grades must con
tinue to remain uppermost in the
minds of all.
I am sure there are some stu
dents at Stanford who desire to
be "educated" and at the same
time be able to receive suitable
recognition of academic achieve
ment in the form of good grades.
I think that quite obviously the
blame for the present poor situa
tion must be placed upon the
somewhat bowed shoulders of the
faculty of this University: only
they can in any way alter the de
gree to which grades reflect the
success of the learning process.
With the realization that the
rectification of the existent in
verted sense of values is a very
difficult task, and that this sense
of values is a fairly old institu
tion, I challenge ihe intelligent
and mature faculty of this Uni
versity to initiate a system of
grading which measures not abil- !
ity to cram for exams, but the
actual learning taking place.

This is in reply to your editorial
entitled "On the Brink" criticizing
Senator Goldwater's recent for
eign policy recommendations. 1 i

| shall restrict my consideration to
the first two sentences of the sec
ond paragraph.
The first sentence asserts that
the senator's tactics fail to take
into account the existing power
balance. The second sentence tai
lors the truth to imply that the
first sentence has foundation. It
erroneously says that the assump
tion has been made that the U.S.
alone is a great power. There do
exist other great powers, but it is
evident that, at least for now, we
are the most powerful, a fact the
Communists accept.
For instance, there was one
major reason the Red Chinese
dared enter the Korean conflict
after we had nearly cleaned up
the whole peninsula. They knew
that McArthur would not be al
lowed to attack the mainland.
Also, consider the Chinese Com-

I munist assault on the contro
! versial offshore islands. The Com-
I munists were confident we would
I back down. However, Congress
1 passed a resolution affirming the
president's authority to use the
Seventh Fleet and, if necessary,
to wage a war in defense of the
islands. Not only was the shelling
stopped bill "peaceful coexist
ence" became the Communist
theme song. The Communist have
nothing to gain by a war, yet.
They are afraid of it and our
; power to wage it.
The technique, exemplified by
your editorial, of using truths,
half truths, vague implications
and false assumptions, all stirred
in together, is common among
those of liberal persuasion. It is
: quick. It sounds nice. But it
breaks down under analysis.

was written by Dr. Watkins.

that you have no direct connec

Editor, the Daily:
As a member of the Class of
1964, I viewed with special inter
est Professor Watkins' article in
Tuesday's Daily challenging my
class to get an education at Stan
ford notwithstanding the pres
sures of grades, and the subse
quent reply of John Bradley in
Wednesday's Daily pointing out
the impossibility of escaping the
grading system.
I share both Mr. Watkins' de
sire that "education" lake place
at Stanford for its own sake, and
Mr. Bradley's recognition that,
realistically, grades must con
tinue to remain uppermost in the
minds of all.
I am sure there are some stu
dents at Stanford who desire to
be "educated" and at the same
time be able to receive suitable
recognition of academic achieve
ment in the form of good grades.
I think that quite obviously the
blame for the present poor situa
tion must be placed upon the
somewhat bowed shoulders of the
faculty of this University: only
they can in any way alter the de
gree to which grades reflect the
success of the learning process.
With the realization that the
rectification of the existent in
verted sense of values is a very
difficult task, and that this sense
of values is a fairly old institu
tion, I challenge ihe intelligent
and mature faculty of this Uni
versity to initiate a system of
grading which measures not abil- !
ity to cram for exams, but the
actual learning taking place.

This is in reply to your editorial
entitled "On the Brink" criticizing
Senator Goldwater's recent for
eign policy recommendations. 1 i

| shall restrict my consideration to
the first two sentences of the sec
ond paragraph.
The first sentence asserts that
the senator's tactics fail to take
into account the existing power
balance. The second sentence tai
lors the truth to imply that the
first sentence has foundation. It
erroneously says that the assump
tion has been made that the U.S.
alone is a great power. There do
exist other great powers, but it is
evident that, at least for now, we
are the most powerful, a fact the
Communists accept.
For instance, there was one
major reason the Red Chinese
dared enter the Korean conflict
after we had nearly cleaned up
the whole peninsula. They knew
that McArthur would not be al
lowed to attack the mainland.
Also, consider the Chinese Com-

I munist assault on the contro
! versial offshore islands. The Com-
I munists were confident we would
I back down. However, Congress
1 passed a resolution affirming the
president's authority to use the
Seventh Fleet and, if necessary,
to wage a war in defense of the
islands. Not only was the shelling
stopped bill "peaceful coexist
ence" became the Communist
theme song. The Communist have
nothing to gain by a war, yet.
They are afraid of it and our
; power to wage it.
The technique, exemplified by
your editorial, of using truths,
half truths, vague implications
and false assumptions, all stirred
in together, is common among
those of liberal persuasion. It is
: quick. It sounds nice. But it
breaks down under analysis.

Each year the ASSU sponsors
the World University Service
Drive. WUS is the direct descend
ant of a relief organization set up
in Europe after World War I. It
has now spread throughout the
world. The work of its 41 Na
tional Committees is coordinated
at the international level by the
General Assembly with head
quarters and permanent staff in
Geneva.
The light against poverty, di
sease, ignorance and despair is
the task of WUS in the inter
national community of students
and professors.
As members of this university
community we can aid in the
j hope for peace and understanding
by responding generously this
week to the WUS Drive. I sin
cerely hope that we as Stanford
students are aware enough of the
need to enable us to surpass our
goal of "a dollar a scalp."

I protest the cruel jest perpe
trated by the author of "Deadlier
Than Smog" (Daily, Nov. 22). By
attributing it to a member of the
faculty he has ridiculed a dis
tinguished colleague and, by ex
tension, all the rest of us. I can
not. understand how you were
taken in. A quick reading should
have warned you that no Stan
ford Professor could be responsi
j ble for such vacuous bathos.
