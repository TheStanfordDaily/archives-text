# PLACE FOUR AMONG FIRST EIGHT
## Harriers Win Coast Crown 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
A courageous band of Stanford cross country runners Saturday morning climaxed a season-long
uphill battle by overwhelming all opposition in the West Coast Collegiate Cross Country Champion
ships.
Running close to the front throughout the race, the Card harriers placed four men among the
top eight in the large field of 44. The low team score of 23 points easily outdistanced all other schools,

as Cal had 44, follower by San
Francisco State with 77, Idaho
79, Occidental 88, Fresno State 94,
and Sacramento State 128.
tin: PERFORMANCE of team
captain Rich Klier was typical of
the Stanford effort. Klier ran the
entire race with a badly gashed
left food, suffered when one of
the other runners accidently
spiked him at the start. But Klier
led throughout the first three
miles of the race, only to be over
taken by little Ron Larrieu of
Cal Poly of Pomona.
Despite the injury and despite
the wet, slippery footing, which
cost ihe barefooted Klier precious
yardage, his second-place time of
21:04 was his fastest so far for
the 4.2 miles and was one of the
ten best ever for the course. The
Card junior easily outdistanced
such pre-race favorites as Dick
Douglas of Idaho, the Pacific
Northwest champion, and Bill
Peck of Occidental, tops in South
ern California, who finished third
and fourth, respectively. Another
lop choice, Cal's Alan Gaylord,
was tenth.
BUT THE real story lies with
the rest of the team. One man is
certainly not enough to win a
race, as was proved by the in
dividual winner. Cal Poly did not
even count in the scoring, despite
Larrieu's win, because he was the
only member of his team entered.
Every one of the top five In
dians ran faster than he was sup
posed to be able to run. The only
thing that kept the times from
being really spectacular was the
heavy track. Even so, three Stan
fordites posted their best ever
times.
The really amazing fact was
that all four Stanford runners
who counted in the scoring fin
ished ahead of the first man from
Cal, the second-place school. Be
sides Klier, John Northway was
sixth, Bill Pratt was seventh, and I
Larry Shafer was eighth. Frank |
Wallace ran by far the best race
of his life to finish 13th in 22:03,
and Robin Ruble rounded out the
Card effort in 27th place.
COACH PAYTON Jordan
stated after the race that, obvi
ously, he was "terribly proud" of
his team. He praised especially
the squad's ability to come back
when the chips were down, in ref
erence to some early season losses
which the harriers suffered. The
coach characterized the team as
"fighters, not give-in-ers."
The Card mentor lauded Klier I
for his desire, dedication and
competitiveness, and Pratt for his
"complete courage and willing
ness to put out effort."
Northway. said Coach Jordan,
has improved by "leaps and
bounds" to the point where he
has become a "mature runner." i
Shafer, he added, has come fur- 1
ther than any other team member
on less experience and natural
ability, but is a dogged fighter
who just doesn't quit.
THE COMPETITION which
these runners overcame Saturday
was certainly the best in the
West. Occidental was unbeaten in ;
the Southland, consistently de
feating USC. UCLA, and the !
So u t hern California Striders.
Idaho had beaten everybody in
the Northwest, including Ore
gon's fine distance runners.
All opposition has now been 1
vanquished, and the Card runners
will settle down to winter prep- :
aration for the coming spring 1
season, which is indeed promis
ing. All of the top nine harriers,
including two juniors, two soph
omores, and five frosh, will be
back next year. Championship
athletes still do reside at the
Farm, and prospects are still bet
ter in the future.
