# Eagles Top New York; Near Division Crown
## Daily 
### United Press International 
The opportunist Philadelphia
Eagles, driving toward the East
ern Division Championship in the
National Football League, made
good on four pass interceptions
and a recovered fumble yesterday
to defeat the New York Giants,
31-23, and move to within one vic
tory of winning the division title.
The San Francisco '49ers upset
the defending champion Balti
more Colts, 30-22, while the Chi
cago Bears ripped the Dallas Cow
boys, 17-7, to tighten up the West
ern Division race.
THE ST. LOUIS Cardinals ral
lied to gain a 17-17 lie with the
Cleveland Browns, and the Pitts
burgh Steelers defeated the Wash
ington Redskins, 22-10 in other
N.F.L. games.
The Eagles, in chalking up their
eighth straight victory since an
opening game loss, opened up a
2'j game lead over both the
Giants and Browns with only
three regular season games left
to play. If the Eagles win only
one of their three remaining
games all on the road they will
gain their first division title since
1949 when they also won the
league championship.
Despite the loss, the Colts hung
onto the Western Division lead
by a half game—with three left
to play. The Bears are second,
another half-game ahead of the
Green Bay Packers, who were idle
yesterday.
IN THE American Football

League, the Denver Broncos
scored 24 points in the final pe- !
riod to gain a 38-38 tie with the j
Buffalo Bills in frigid and snowy j
Denver, and the Los Angeles
[Chargers defeated the Oakland j
Raiders, 52-28, to move to within
I two victories of clinching at least
ja tie for the Western Division
i title.
The Eagles gained their victory
the hard way, but in the process
completely demoralized the usu
ally efficient Giants. They picked
off a total of four passes thrown
by Giant sub quarterback George
Shaw and converted each into a
score. Later, a recovered fumble
deep in Giant territory, led to an
other score." Combining the pin
point passing of Norman Van
Brocklin and the hard running of
Ted Dean and Billy Barnes, Phil
adelphia scored 17 points in the
I second period, but left the field at
halftime trailing by three points.
New York scored another three
points in the third period on Pat
Summerall's third field goal, but
I then the Eagles went to work. 1
They intercepted their fourth pass
on the final play of the period and
then took just one play—a 49-yard
pass and run play from Van
: Brocklin to Dean to tie at 23-all. :
Bobby Walston kicked the extra
; point and the Giants never recov-1
