##

There's a student in Hong Kong who lives with three friends in a
packing-box house . . . 500 meals each day arc cooked in three big
buckets over a single gas burner at a makeshift dining hall in Tunis
. . . there are similar situations that can be corrected with money
collected by the World University Service.
Stanford's annual drive for WUS contributions starts today. Most

of the money collected here will
he used in Africa to keep students
in school despite threats of ill
health, bad housing, and marginal
school facilities, says Stanford
drive chairman Phil Schneider.
WUS is concentrating its cur
rent efforts in Asia to bolster the
strength of new nations by help
ing them educate skilled tech
nicians.
In past years, WUS offered aid
to European refugees, provided
scholarships, medicines and food.
In the Middle East WUS money
is being used for books to bolster
extremely inadequate libraries.
Dormitories are being built. Tech
nical education equipment is
being shipped to universities.
An international Secretariat,
with headquarters in Geneva, co
ordinates the work of more than
40 WUS branches around the
globe. Programs and policies are
designed each year by assembled
! representatives of the branches.
; Stanford's WUS campaign is con
ducted by the Institute of Inter
national Relations. Schneider
announced the Stanford cam
paign includes:
• TONIGHT: Stanford talent
night at Outside-at-the-Inside in
Palo Alto. Three shows the first
at 9 p.m.—will feature Stanford
talent. All profits to go to WUS.
• THURSDAY: Auction of
merchandise donated by local
businessmen. All money collected
goes to WUS.
• FRIDAY: Senior Happy
Hour at Rudolfo's. All profits go
to WUS.
• ALL WEEK: Living group
representatives—one per group
will bo available to collect con

This year's goal at Stanford is
$5,000, says Schneider. The lIR

Stanford's contributions be used
to aid students in Africa.
