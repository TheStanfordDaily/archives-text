### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (UPI) — National guardsmen fired their
submachine guns last night into a crowd of several thousand stone
throwing anti-government rioters who had taken possession of San
Martin Avenue in downtown Caracas. At least 50 persons were
wounded.
Authorities said an 18-year-old student was killed and at least

five others were injured, al
though most observers believed
the wounded count would run as
high as 50.
The rioters hurled stones which
j they took from several buildings
; under construction in the area at
the national guardsmen who were
reinforced and began throwing a
cordon around the mob in an ef
fort to isolate it.
THE demonstrations began
about noontime but became more
serious after dark.
Earlier, the guard had used
tear gas and fired shots into the
j air to disperse some 600 rioters
; who set fire to two buses while
marching on a Caracas high
school in which other demonstra
tors had barricaded themselves.
THE sporadic rioting against
the government of President
Romulo Betancourt entered its
third day, touched off by a strike
of telephone workers which was
settled Saturday morning. The
government blamed the riots on
leftist agitators.
Two persons were reported
killed by police Saturday night
and more than 65 persons injured
in the two previous days of
bloody rioting.
Barricaded in Fermin Toro
School near the presidential pal
ace were holdouts from the riot
ing Friday and Saturday, at least
some of them known to be armed.
They defied repeated warnings to
surrender from national guard
units which have cordoned off the
building.
