# Debates Won by Indians
## 
### 
Stanford's debate squad emerg
ed victorious over 55 other schools
in the Western Speech Associa
tion's championship tournament
last Monday, Tuesday, and Wed
nesday at Corvallis, Ore.
The Indian speakers won the
tournament's school trophy, sym
bolic of the best over-all perform
ance by any college in the western
half of the country.
Four Stanford speakers, Bob
Savler, Barrie Thorne, Mike Hall,
and Chuck Bischoff, had superior
performances in the maximum of
three events each.
BUT ALL TEN Stanfordites ex
celled in at least one event, and
Bob Best, Karen Stueky, Tom Om
men, Don Boilcau, Barry Carter,
and Dave Commons all played an
important part in the win.
Specializing in debate, the Farm
orators were the most outstand
ing in that event. Out of 172 two
man teams entered, only one team
remained undefeated at the end
of the three days.
It was the Stanford pair of Hall
and Bischoff, who survived nine
rounds of argument on both sides
of the topic: "Resolved: That the
United States should adopt a sys
tem of compulsory health insur
ance for all citizens," without the
loss of even one judge's ballot.
TWO OTHER Stanford teams
nearly matched this performance,
only to lose narrow decisions on
the final day to the winners of
their respective divisions.
Sayler and Best, pre-tourna
ment favorites on the basis of
their unbeaten record the previ
ous week; used brilliant analysis,
especially on the negative, to de
feat their opposition in the pre
liminary rounds.
They appeared certain to cop
the trophy in senior division, only
to be upset in the end by a sur
prising team from USC. Never
theless, they received the highest
ratings of any pair in the tourna
ment, including the team which
defeated them.
IN THE junior women's divi
sion, Miss Thorne and Miss
Stucky posted a similar mark.
They too lost out narrowly in the
end. as the winners were two girls
from Washington. The decision
of the single judge, however,
came as a surprise to the specta
tors, many of whom disagreed.
Boilcau and Ommen also distin
guished themselves in debate, win
ning four of their five preliminary
rounds.
In the individual events, the
Stanfordites did almost as well.
Nine Indians received top ratings,
four of them in two events.
3IISS THORNE had the best
record, achieving one of the high
est ratings in the entire tourna
ment in extemporaneous speak
ing. She likewise excelled in im
promptu. as she was rated first
in four out of five rounds. Miss
Stucky also achieved a very high
rating in impromptu speaking.
In men's extemporaneous speak
ing Best, Hall, and Ommen were
rated very highly, with Bischoff
only a step behind.
Orators Carter and Sayler were
outstanding, and Commons, Say
ler, Hall and Bischoff topped the
list in impromptu.
