# Macy's to Start New Building
## 
### 
Construction of the Stanford
Shopping Center's second major
department store, Macy's Califor
nia, will get underway today with
ground-breaking ceremonies at
tended by business and commu
nity leaders.
The $6 million, two-level depart
ment store will join 52 other ten
ants in the Stanford location, just
off PJI Camino Real in Palo Alto.
The completed building will
contain 150,000 square feet of
floor space. Its design permits the
future addition of one or two
more floors, up to a maximum of
300,000 square feet, as demands
of the area increase.
Actual ground-breaking for the
new store will take place in a
paved parking area which now
covers the site. With construction
of the new store an additional 10
acres, held in reserve for the shop
ping center by Stanford, will be
developed to provide ample new
parking space for customers.
The 43-acre Stanford Shopping
Center was opened in 1955, and
the property is leased to tenant
stores. Under terms of the Uni
versity Founding Grant, Stanford
lands cannot be sold.
