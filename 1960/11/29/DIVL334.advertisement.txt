■AL HAVE Al-WAYS HAD an
abiding hatred for the bottom crust
of rye bread. There is no particular
reason for making this point, except
that whenever I think of Fort
Lauderdale, I think of rye bread.
There is no particular reason for that
either, but I have been thinking of
Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale is
"where the boys are." Right now,
that is. Most of the time, serenity
reigns in Fort Lauderdale. (1 he
Chamber of Commerce will hate me;
they say it never rains in fort
Lauderdale.) But, for two weeks,
twenty thousand collegians descend
on this peaceful community and take
it apart, peace by peace. They call
it Spring Vacation, but it's more like
amateur night at Cape Canaveral.
They capture Florida and throw the
Keys away. But I shouldn't joke—
not while people are holding mass
prayer meetings for an early hurri
cane season.
This is "where the boys are." And
girls, too. Such girls, it makes you
dizzy to look at them. If you look long
enough, you reach an advanced
stage of dizziness called aphro
dizzier. It's like being in love. That's
what happened to me, and it will
happen to you, too. Everywhere you
turn — beaches full of them, motels
and hotels full of them, cars full of
them, pools full of them, bathing
suits full of them. Ah, bathing suits
. . . when the man said, "It's the
little things in life that count," he
must have been thinking of bathing
suits. But mostly, it's the girls.
Girls in love, girls in trouble, bright
girls with a future, not-so-britjht
girls with a past, rich girls in the lap
of luxury, poor girls in any lap
that'll have them, girls of every size
and discretion. It isn't any wonder
that this is "where the boys are."
And the things that happen are
wacky and wild and wicked and
warmly wonderful "where the boys
are." Someone should make a movie
about it. Hey, someone did! M-G-M
calls it "Where The Boys Arc,"
starring Dolores Hart, George Hamil
ton, Yvette Mimicux, Jim Hutton,
Barbara Nichols, Paula Prentiss, with
Frank Gorshin and introducing popu
lar recording star Connie Francis
in her first screen role. You'll
want to see all the things^
that happen "Where The x I'ljrr
Boys Arc."
