# Ga. Sit-ins Shut Down Counters
## 
### 
ATLANTA (UPI i â€” Negro
sit-in demonstrators forced the
closing of five downtown "target"
lunch counters yesterday, shortly
after an attempt to settle the
racial problem fell through.
Small groups of Negro students
took seats at the five drugstore
lunch counters. Store employes
immediately roped off the areas
and closed the counters. There
were no incidents.
Robed Ku Klux Klansmen who
picketed the Negro students over
the weekend were not present
yesterday, but the Negro students
threw up a new picket line around
the huge Rich's Department
Store. The store's eating facilities,
closed since last Friday, were not
open, however.
NEGKO leaders whose actions
were disclaimed by the demon
strators scheduled a meeting
earlier yesterday with white mer
chant* to talk over a possible
settlement but the session never
got started.
Dr. Rufus Clement, president
of the Negro Atlanta University,
declared "we can't hold it in an
atmosphere of publicity. This
thing is full of dynamite."
The meeting was to have been
held at a Negro YMCA. Several
leaders from both races arrived
but left within minutes when
they saw reporters. Those on
hand in addition to Clement, in
cluded Frank Neely, chairman of
the board of Rich's, and Richard
11. Rich, president of the firm.
LONNIE King, spokesman for
the Negro Committee on Appeal
for Human Rights, said picketing
and sit-ins would continue despite
the meeting which he said was
attended by "certain Negro
leaders."
King said representatives of the
sit-in demonstrators were not in
vited and "therefore we will not
necessarily be bound by any
agreement."
The "certain Negro leaders"
King referred to included some
who have declined to give their
support to the lunch counter de
segregation effort.
