CARACAS (UPI) Government troops opened fire last night on several groups of armed rioters
trying to storm a police station in the northwestern suburb of Catia.
Police said at least two persons were killed and 35 wounded in yesterday's violence.
One of those killed was a 17-year-old boy who died when the disturbances spread to the northern
surburb of Cherneca.
President Romula Betaneourt, claiming the violence was a Communist attempt to put Venezuela

under a dictatorship, called out
the army and suspended consti
tutional guarantees.
The armed forces command is
sued orders that troops were to
shoot looters, arsonists and agi
tators who do not obey the first
order to halt. The troops were
given orders to search and ar
rest any suspects.
FIRING was heard in another
northwestern -suburb. 23 Do
Enero, but there was no immedi
ate report of any riot there.
Police said yesterday's out
breaks raised the death toll to
five in the four days of rioting,
and estimated that at least 200
persons had been wounded and
injured.
Another demonstration involv
ing some 500 anti-government
demonstrators broke out in the
suburb of Petare when some of
the demonstrators tried to erect
barricades. The mob was scat
tered about two hours after the
demonstrations began.
(Authorities in the oil produc
ing center of Maracaibo, which
was reported calm, warned that
they would take stern measures
to supress any attempt to disturb
the status quo.)
THE FEDERATION of Univer
sity Students charged in a pro
test to the government, mean
while, that occupants of an uni
dentified jeep fired a machine
gun while passing by Venezuela
Central University, ft said three
students were wounded by bullets.
Elsewhere, police in the Caracas
port of La Guaira dispersed a
high school student's demonstra
tion wilh tear gas bombs shortly
after it began. There were no
casualties reported there.
Constitutional guarantees were
suspended throughout the nation
for an indefinite period because,
Bctaneourt said, the government
will not tolerate "civil war" in
Venezuela.
As the president spoke yester
day afternoon, riots raged
through downtown Caracas. The
presidential palace was put under
heavy tank and infantry guard.
Street barricades were erected to
divert traffic.
THE PRESIDENT'S decisions
were announced to the people
over a nationwide radio and tele
vision hookup. His speech came
after a four-hour emergency ses
sion of the cabinet.
After Betaneourt's speech, the
crowds dispersed and the city re
turned to normalcy. By nightfall,
only a handful of students were
seen in a group on the Venezuela
Central University grounds.
Top government, army, politi
cal and labor leaders supported
Betaneourt's decision to use
troops to end the street rioting
which has paralyzed the city for
the past four days.
BETANC OURT specifically ac
cused the Communist Party and
leftist political movements of
being responsible for the dis
orders.
"They form a part of the insur
rection which seeks to establish
in Venezuela a regime similar to
that in Cuba," he declared.
