# IN SPRING
## SU Press To Expand 
### 
Plans to increase the size of
the Stanford University Press
were announced yesterday by
University planning officials.
The Board of Trustees has ap
proved the appointment of Archi
tect Hervey Parke Clark of Wood
side and San Francisco to draw
the plans and specifications.
THE new project will consist of
two 10,000-square-foot additions
to the existing Press building at
Panama and Lomita streetsâ€”a
bindery and a book storage ware
house.
Clark was the architect of Bow
man Alumni House, which was
dedicated in May 1952.
The book storage warehouse
will face Bowman House across
Santa Teresa Street. The bindery
will lie north and south inside the
present confines of the Univer
sity's Corporation Yard. Both new
buildings will connect to the ex
isting building.
A BID call will be issued in late
spring and construction is ex
pected to start soon afterward.
Tilt-up type construction is con
templated.
Plans to move certain portions
of the Corporation Yard to a new
location near the athletic fields
will be coordinated with construc
tion.
Schematic diagrams of a new
student publications building, to
arise near the Stanford Daily
shack, will also be drawn by the
architect.
