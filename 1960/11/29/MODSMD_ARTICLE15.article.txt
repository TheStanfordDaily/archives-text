# WUS Enters Second Day of Annual Drive
## 
### 
Paul Deniese, from WUS Na
tional Headquarters, will high
light the second day of the WUS
drive with a talk at 4:30 this
afternoon in the Branner Lounge.
He will speak to all interested
students on "WUS as an invest
ment in the future." Refresh
ments will be served.
The work that WUS is doing in
Africa is a prime example of
WUS as an "investment in the
future."
FOR EXAMPLE, at the present
time in the Union of South Africa
there is approximately one Afri
can doctor for every 25,000 Afri
cans. There is only one medical
school, Witwatersrand University,
for African students.
To aid in remedying this situ
ation, WUS is helping African
medical scholars enrolled at Wit
watersrand to complete their
studies. It is contributing for the
expansion of libraries and class
rooms.
By doing this, WUS hopes to
stimulate the raising of the re
maining money necessary to com
plete those projects.
Also, last June in Sierra Leone,
a WUS seminar was held to study
student health problems.
FINDING that the establish
ment of university health services
was imperative to protect future
generations from contagion, these
WUS executives incorporated into
their Program of Action for 1961-
62 a contribution to help set up
university health services in
Basutoland, the @ongo, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Rhodesia and Sudan.
In addition to these projected
plans WUS initiated several com
munity projects.
Among these were a literacy
campaign in Sierra Leone and
Basutoland, construction work
camps in Ghana and village re
constructions after floods in
Sudan.
"In the strictest sense," said
Patsy Reillv, WUS chairman for
Stanford, "this is not charity, but
an investment."
