In discussing: World University Service, Frank I*. Graham, Unit
ed Nations Representative for India and Pakistan, said: .. In
seeking to build freedom and peace out of the cultural and spirit
ual resources deep in the nature and hopes of youth, the youth in
our colleges will he joining in an international, cultural and spirit
ual communion with all its potentialities of a chain reaction for
understanding and peace among the peoples of the earth."
Stanford's annual drive for WUS contributions is now in its
second day and will continue through Friday. The goal: $5,000.
Last year the goal was also $5,000. Surprisingly, contributions fell
considerably short of this figure.
The WUS campaign is one of the most worthwhile projects to
exist on this or any other campus in the United States. The money
is used to build homes for homeless students, for textbooks, sani
toriums for tubercular students, scholarships and relief funds in
disaster-stricken areas.
Ralph J. Bunche, United Nations Under-Secretary, said: ". . .
World University Service ... is engaged in a world-wide mutual
aid program directed at helping students to help themselves, giv
ing a helping hand to the leaders of tomorrow."
S. Radhakrislinan, Vice-President of India, said: '"If there is a
task set for our generation, it is the task of fostering a world com
munity. \\ orld University Service ... is one of the means by which
world community is sought to be built."
Stanford students are given the opportunity this week to par
ticipate in the fight against poverty, hunger, sickness and despair
at colleges throughout the world.
\ our contribution is tantamount to an expression of faith in
education to alleviate world tensions and to solve international
problems in a peaceful manner.
If every student at Stanford eontributed Si the goal of $5,000
would be easily surpassed. You will rarely have the chance to give
$1 to a more worthy cause.
