The fears of European minor
ities in Africa, that rule by a
black majority would mean- the
end of their national existence,
cannot simply be regarded as ir
rational manifestations of color
prejudice.
European fears of minority
status are only all too well under
lined by the experiences of minor
ities in other parts of the world,
be they Armenians in the Otto
man Empire, Greeks in Anatolia,
Jews in Central and Eastern Eu
rope, Japanese in Russian-occu
pied Sakhalin, or the Dutch in
Indonesia.
The apprehensions of White
Africans will not be quieted by
promises of local politicians or
by international gurantees. The
history of international interven
tion on behalf of minorities is a
melancholy one.
The Jews in newly independent
Rumania received during the last
century, the most specific prom
ises of protection—but these were
of no avail to them. Attempts to
maintain law and order in strife
ridden Macedonia, made before
the First World War by an inter
national police force, proved to be
a complete failure.
Most of the newly independent
Arab states treated their minor
ities badly after the Second
World War, and so have politi
cians in Black Africa. Mr. Hou
phouet-Boigny soon after he be
came premier of an independent
Ivory Coast ordered the explusion
of 28,000 "foreign Africans" who
happened to own businesses and
to occupy government posts.
Similarly the position of Indi
ans throughout East and Central
Africa has steadily worsened as
self-government has drawn near.
The boycott of Indian merchants
in Uganda, their intimidation in
Nyasaland and Kenya are, of
course, well known.
The problem of minorities, one
might add, does not always be
come easier to solve under Marx
ist regimes, even though these
may be theoretically based on the

principal that class, not race, is
the decisive element in history.
The setting 1 up of People's
Democracies in Czechoslovakia
and Poland was accompanied by
I mass expulsions of Germans and
Hungarians, regardless of social
origins. When Soviet Russia oc-
I cupied Southern Sakhalin after
the Second World War it also ex
pelled most of the Japanese popu
lation, workers and peasants
alike.
In addition. Whites and Indians
dread most the dangers of an in
terim-regime and the period of
violence and breakdown of gov
ernment that often precedes it.
The Wiemar Republic during the
depression, India in 1945-47, and
pre-1948 Palestine are examples
of what could happen.
A heavy price was paid for
British statesmanship in India;
but it was paid by eight million
Indian expellees and hundreds of
thousands of dead, not by Lon
don leader-writers. Kenyans and
Rhodesians understandably hesi
tate to risk a similar fate. And the
occasional anti-European speeches
of the Bandas (Africa for Afri
cans) and the Mboyas (White
man scram) do little to encourage
trust. While Julius Nyerere of
Tanganyika rules firmly and
quiets racist feeling, Kauntla and
Sipalo in Northern Rhodesia re
sort to intimidation and incite
racial discord.
What is involved therefore i«
not only an exercise in ethics, but
a transfer of powers, which raises
problems of the grimmest kind.
Some African leaders are aware
of these difficulties. But it is the
fate of most nationalist and revo
lutionary movements to become
more and more radical. The maxi
mum demands of one day become
the minimum demands of the
next; the Girondin« are beheaded
by the Jacobins; Kerensky falls
before the Bolsheviks.
This is not a plea for doing
nothing, but rather for a cautious
recognition of the facts. Outside
of the Union of South Africa,
there is no question but that Afri
cans will eventually come to
power all over the continent.
Time and numbers are on their
side; a little patience is all they
need. And patience will pay off,
for in Marxist terms, the role of
the Whites (except in Angola and
Mozambique) is still a progres
sive one.
