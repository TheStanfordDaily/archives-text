The case of J. E. Wallace Ster
ling proves that a college presi
dent can be a good educator even
if he also is involved in raising
funds for his school, says the Dec.
3 issue of The Saturday Evening
Post out on the newstands today.
Under his leadership, it is re
ported, staid old Stanford has
been overhauled both academical
ly and physically.
Frank J. Taylor's article, "Stan
ford's Man With the Midas
Touch," says that the University's
endowment has almost doubled,
to $92 million, and its income al
most tripled.
"By boldly investing in faculty
brainpower and by daring raids
to corral outstanding personnel
from other campuses," Taylor
writes, "Sterling has boosted his
institution to a position of pres
tige among the country's big ten
privately endowed universities."
