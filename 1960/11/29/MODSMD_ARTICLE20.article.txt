Editor, the Daily:
I am a transfer student from
a "Soutticrn" university. When I
arrived, many people asked me
how I "stood" the conservative,
reactionary attitudes that must
have "been rampant on the cam
pus. I can only say that after two
months on the Stanford campus,
I have been forced to conclude
that "liberal" ideas put forth by
the Daily, dubbed radical by
many, would have been laughed
out of the University of Maryland
a-s reactionary.
When the editor of the paper
can ask for "a comparison of the
basic tenets of Communism to the
basic tenets of Democracy," im
plying that a basic contradiction
exists, he not only reveals a
strongly conservative attitude, he
also reveals an ignorance of his
subject.
The basic tenet s of Marxist-
Leninist theory are in no way
contradictory to Democracy. They
ARE contradictory to Capitalism.
Their present application in the
USSR IS contradictory to Democ
racy. But there can certainly be
no doubt in anyone's mind that
the United States hardly lives up
to its ideals in the field of Democ
racy—witness, for example, the
DAR and the House Un-American
Activities Committee.
And, in a more extreme but still
similar way, the USSR has be
trayed its ideals. Its ideals are
high; by damning them you leave
yourself wide open to criticism.
That its Constitution is a good
deal more liberal than ours is
should not be ignored.
