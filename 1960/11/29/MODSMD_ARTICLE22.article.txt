The main course of the I!X>0 collegiate football season has been
served. All that remains is the dessert.
The first big Saturday- way back in late September looked
like an exquisite appetizer. Three of the top ten teams in the annual
Associated Press pre-season poll bit the dust. Texas, the number 4
outfit was beaten by Nebraska 14-13; Southern California, number 6,
was upset by Oregon State 14-0; and Pitt, number 7, was handed an
8-7 defeat by UCLA. This happened when only five of the top ten
opened their campaign!
THEN EYEN before the hot soup course was cool enough to be
eaten, the thrills and unexpected wonders of the lovable fall season
filled every inch of the sports pages. Navy pulled off what was up
to that time the upset of the year edging last year's Rose Bowl
champion Washington by a field goal in the last 14 seconds. The
score was 15-14. The University of lowa Hawkeyes showed some of
the power and even more of the unpredictibility of the Big Ten
Conference by speeding past a highly thought of Northwestern team
by Ihe count of -12-0. lowa gained 303 yards on the ground against
Oklahoma.
Purdue a two-point underdog blasted Notre Dame the once
perennial powerhouse 51-19. Leading by one point at the end of the
first quarter the Boilermakers went crazy and tallied four touch
downs in the second stanza to blow the game wide open. As any
close follower of Big Ten football will tell you this year's Purdue
team was by far the most volatile of them all. (We shed a salty tear
at this portion of the meal to all play boys for it seems that USC's
Trojans, that fine sporting magazine's pick as the best team in the
nation had just lost their third consecutive outing.)
French, Roquefort or Thousand Island
THE SALAI) was served on October 8 and there was an almost
unlimited choice of tasty dressings. Syracuse, riding the top rung
in the wire service polls, rallied in the last quarter to beat back a
determined Holy Cross squad. The Orangemen were such a heavy
favorite that the bookies refused to accept any bets. Arkansas, the
ninth-ranked team and supposedly a real Southern power, bowed
to Baylor by 28-14. Starting to give the bettors fits that cute Purdue
team lost to Wisconsin 24-13.
As we paused for breath in anticipation of the main course, one
lhat was billed to bo fit for the noblest connoisseur, we got our first
glimpse of the Golden Gophers of Minnesota. History is necessary.
The 1957 Minnesota team, a pre-season Big Ten favorite, was a tragic
disappointment. The 1958 team won only one game and the 1959
team with superb but inexperienced young players dropped five
conference games by a total of 32 points, then lost to lowa 33-0 and
fell into the cellar. So it did not seem strange to any gridiron filbert
that Coach Murray Warmath's boys only entered the top ten ranked
learns the week of October 15th after running off three victories
two over Big Ten foes. The Gophers then upset a powerful Illinois
team to whet all appetites.
Navy crushed the Air Force 35-3 and marked the emergence of
one of the finest service teams seen in many years. Not to forget
Ihe always unpredictible Purdue eleven —they merely sprung the
upset of the day by handing third-ranked Ohio State its first defeat.
THE CHILLY weather of late October brought in the waiter to
prepare the feast right next to the table for this was to be a true
banquet. lowa, the top-ranked team in the United States, warmed
up for its momentous clash with the now second-ranked Golden
Gophers of Minnesota by throttling a strong Kanasa State 48-7.
Elsewhere Washington although outplayed rallied to top Oregon
by one point. Notre Dame lost its fifth straight game before 63,000
fans at Philadelphia and steady Purdue was upset by Illinois 14-12.
The Main Course Is Served
At last the delicious spread was in front of us and the savory
taste will long be remembered. The Golden Gophers, having lost
to lowa for five years in a row, finally gained revenge and the top
ranking in the country. They bested the Hawkeyes 27-10.
Washington trounced USC and all but secured its return to the
Ro-se Bowl and the season seemed pretty well set. But this was not
to be the case at all. The very next Saturday while the succulent
flavor of the previous week still lingered, Purdue came from no
where to do it again—this time upsetting Minnesota. This pushed
Missouri into the top spot but just seven days later Kansas came
along and knocked the unbeaten Tigers from the pedestal. Min
nesota thus regained the cherished number 1 position and a berth in
the Rose Bowl Classic.
Dessert anyone?
