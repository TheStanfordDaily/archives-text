### KEN DERY 
FEATURING the tallest team
in Stanford basketball history
area fans just may have some
thing to cheer about before too
long. Out of 29 players who were
on hand for the opening sessions
in the middle of October, 12 meas
ured 6-4 or better and four topped
the 6-7 mark.
While this squad will be bigger
than those in the past, Coach
Howie Dallmar .still has to find
the scorer to replace graduated

John Arrillaga, the only Indian
who averaged in double figures
last year.
Tabbed for starting positions in
Thursday's opening clash with
always rough St. Mary's are co
captains Bub Bowling and John
Hendry, John Windsor, Rich Hos
lev and Don Clementson.
BOWLING, a 5-11, senior guard
led the team in assists last year
and his floor generalship is one
of the keys if the Tribe is to
move the ball.
Hendry, from Napa, is also a
senior and although not one of
the giants <6-3, 190) he is a strong
rebounder and has been a starter
for two years. Not a prolific
scorer, John can get the hot hand
and his jumper can be tough.
Hosley, another in the 6-7 bri
gade. will provide badly needed
board strength for the Indians.
Out last season with a serious
neck injury, Hosley is a sopho
more in eligibility and a rough
customer under the backboards.
JUST a junior and very promis
ing is 6-7 forward John Windsor,
last year's second Jiigh scorer
with a 9.9 points per game aver
age.
Clementson and twin brother

Doug team up in what looked to
he a real mirror act of the Tribe.
Forwards Tim and Jim Bryan are
also twins, but Jim, an excellent
jump shot, is out for the season
with an ankle injury sustained
this summer.
In addition to 1 lie starters, two
other boys who gained experience
in 1959-60 have returned. Phil
Kelly and Tim Bryan will help
compose the second line that also
features 6-7, 225 Mike Ledger
wood at center. Kelly, a 6-2 junior
forward, developed into one of
the team's better scorers toward
the end of last season.
Coach Dallmar had this to say
about his tall team: "We have
more size this year and will be
more conscious to board position
ing. With this expected rebound
ing strength we should be fast
breaking a lot more although we
aren't really a fast breaking
team."
When asked the most leading
question of all Coach Dallmar re
plied: "We will be much improved
but are lacking in experience at
center. We do have the kind of
weaknesses that should be less
ened as we mature and I think
that we will mature rapidly."

There will be a special 400-
seat student rooting section
in the Pavilion for all home
basketball games this year.
It will be located to the right,
as you walk in. Signs will in
dicate the exact position of
the rooting section.

Howie Dallmar .still has to find
the scorer to replace graduated

John Arrillaga, the only Indian
who averaged in double figures
last year.
Tabbed for starting positions in
Thursday's opening clash with
always rough St. Mary's are co
captains Bub Bowling and John
Hendry, John Windsor, Rich Hos
lev and Don Clementson.
BOWLING, a 5-11, senior guard
led the team in assists last year
and his floor generalship is one
of the keys if the Tribe is to
move the ball.
Hendry, from Napa, is also a
senior and although not one of
the giants <6-3, 190) he is a strong
rebounder and has been a starter
for two years. Not a prolific
scorer, John can get the hot hand
and his jumper can be tough.
Hosley, another in the 6-7 bri
gade. will provide badly needed
board strength for the Indians.
Out last season with a serious
neck injury, Hosley is a sopho
more in eligibility and a rough
customer under the backboards.
JUST a junior and very promis
ing is 6-7 forward John Windsor,
last year's second Jiigh scorer
with a 9.9 points per game aver
age.
Clementson and twin brother

Doug team up in what looked to
he a real mirror act of the Tribe.
Forwards Tim and Jim Bryan are
also twins, but Jim, an excellent
jump shot, is out for the season
with an ankle injury sustained
this summer.
In addition to 1 lie starters, two
other boys who gained experience
in 1959-60 have returned. Phil
Kelly and Tim Bryan will help
compose the second line that also
features 6-7, 225 Mike Ledger
wood at center. Kelly, a 6-2 junior
forward, developed into one of
the team's better scorers toward
the end of last season.
Coach Dallmar had this to say
about his tall team: "We have
more size this year and will be
more conscious to board position
ing. With this expected rebound
ing strength we should be fast
breaking a lot more although we
aren't really a fast breaking
team."
When asked the most leading
question of all Coach Dallmar re
plied: "We will be much improved
but are lacking in experience at
center. We do have the kind of
weaknesses that should be less
ened as we mature and I think
that we will mature rapidly."

There will be a special 400-
seat student rooting section
in the Pavilion for all home
basketball games this year.
It will be located to the right,
as you walk in. Signs will in
dicate the exact position of
the rooting section.
FEATURING the tallest team
in Stanford basketball history
area fans just may have some
thing to cheer about before too
long. Out of 29 players who were
on hand for the opening sessions
in the middle of October, 12 meas
ured 6-4 or better and four topped
the 6-7 mark.

than those in the past, Coach
