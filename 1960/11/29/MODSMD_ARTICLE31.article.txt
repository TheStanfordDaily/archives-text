# AMA May Help Medical Students
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) â€” The
American Medical Association
was urged yesterday to set up a
student scholarship and loan pro
gram lo help meet the nation's
"crucial" need for more qualified
medical students.
The Association's Council on
Medical Education and Hospitals
recommended that 50 scholar
ships of SI.OOO each be given an
nually to talented students who
need ihe money to enter medical
school.
The number of scholarships
would be doubled each year until
the program was supporting 200
students annually.
The proposal was among some
30 resolutions and reports sub
mitted for action to the AMA's
policy-making House of Dele
gates. The House is meeting here
in conjunction with the AMA's
14th clinical conference.
The AMA's Council on Medical
Education and Hospitals said the
decline in medical students was
"due in part to the high cost in
time and money" required for a
medical education.
"The trend has been heightened
by a dramatic emphasis on
careers in science and engineer
ing which are stressed by the ur
gency of certain domestic and
international issues," the report
said.
It said the need for more phy
sicians in the future was "crucial"
in view of predictions that the
nation's population would in
crease about 55 million in 15
years.
