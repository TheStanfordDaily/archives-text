### 
\ INITED NATIONS. N.Y. i IJIT > Tho United States offered yes
lerday to pa> hall of the $(>0 million cost of operating United Nations
forces in ihe Congo provided the outlay is made part of the regular
budget of the world organization.
The proposal, made by Sen. George D. Aiken ill-Vt.i, in the Ad-

ministrative and Budget Commit
tee, was an attempt to force Rus
sia to pay a share of the Congo
bill. Russia and the Communist
satellites have said they will pay
nothing. Russia immediately re
jected Aiken's proposal.
THE U.K. offer followed a re
cent announcement by Secretary-
General Dag Hammarskjold that
â€¢he United Nations is running
short of money and will have to
call off the Congo operation un
less members contributed to the
cost at a faster and higher rate.
Hammarskjold came under
heavy Russian fire for borrowing
from other U.N. funds for emer
gencies in the past. Soviet Dele
gate Alexei A. Roschin called the
practice "illegal" and said it is
not authorized by any U.N. office.
AIKEN said the United States
had waived payment of $10,317,-
621.52 as its cost of airlifting
troops of various countries to the
Congo to serve with the U.N.
force there. He pledged an addi
tional $3.5 to $4 million contri
bution.
On the basis of Aiken's offer
the United States would be billed
for about $16.25 million for the
Congo costs. The waiver on air
lift payments and the future con
tribution would bring the total
to about $30 million.
Russia has refused to pay any
of the cost of the U.N. force on
duty between Israel and the
United Arab Republic in the
Ga/a strip and contends the costs
should be borne by the nations in
volved. In the Congo, Russia in
sists Belgium should finance the
U.N. operation.
