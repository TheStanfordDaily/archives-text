# Faculty Residents Assess Program
## 
### ILENE STRELITZ 
Stanford's gradual growth in numbers over
iho years has, inevitably, brought with it
i growth of the gap between the student and
t lie professor. The evolution of these groups
! as "Two distinct bodies lias continued, if not
unnoticed then unchanged, for several years.
Gradual recognition of the fruits of educa
! lion being lost by restricting relationships to
the classroom has resulted in what has finally
j emerged as the faculty resident and associate
! programs.
THJO FIRST STKI" in the program came in
1955 when Wilbur Hall was constructed with
the inclusion of adjoining housing facilities
for eight faculty members and their families.
Lagunita Court, then an all sophomore resi
dence, served as Ihe experimental cite for the
faculty associate program, which included
twenty members at its onset.
As of May 1959, with the program but one
! year old, the consensus of student opinion
termed the activities worthwhile, but showing
a need to be carried further. The faculty felt
the program successful, but too new to be
evaluated.
LAVVHi:NC K THOMAS, present faculty
resident at Wilbur's Madera House is a vet
eran of the program. Feeling that personal
contact at meals is one of the prime sources
of accomplishment, Thomas encourages his
boys to drop in informally when the light is
on outside his cottage. Otherwise the Wilbur
i residents know he is busy, an I should be

called upon only in cases of urgent need. By
sitting down and talking with the elected of
ficers of the group, he acts as witness and
historian of what has gone before, thereby
providing the officers with experience upon
which to build.
Thomas believes the attitude of accepting
responsibility for managing their own af
fairs is most prevelant in (lie present set of
freshmen. He feels this maturity would be
much less without the benefit of the sponsor
and resident program. With the students
planning their own intellectual and cultural
activities, as faculty resident he need only
provide advice as opposed to initiative.
THOMAS SUGGESTED that the program
could be improved by enlarging the faculty
associate program from its present size of
four faculty members to a house to at least
six or eight. The main problem, he feels, is
the fact that the small resident cottages don't
account for growing faculty families. As
soon as a resident ha* been working a year
or two and has gained the experience to be
truly helpful, cramped conditions force him
to leave.
As a resident at Rineonada Richard Kraus
feels the first quarter is occupied in getting
to know the 90 boys in his charge at some
thing deeper than a mere superficial level
of greeting. Inviting the boys over for reg
ular Sunday afternoons at his cottage, Kraus
says he is available for any type of counsel
ing "short (>I motherhood and psychiatry."
Trying to avoid regularly scheduled activi

ties, he feels the frosh are pressed for time
and resent having to attend, for reasons of
courtesy, planned functions.
ONK OF THE MAIN advantages of the
program, Kraus says, is always having some
one around to consult at times of late hour
desperation. Agreeing with Thomas, he
states, "The best fruit of the program comes
from the bull sessions around the dinner
table. All you have to do is have a good per
son in the job, then (the resident program)
will run effectively." Once again the limited
living quarters were cited as a deterent of
the program.
Trancos' Marshall Baker feels that one of
the major activities he has undertaken this
quarter is having the boys invite represent
atives of various university departments to
the cottage on Monday nights for informal
talks and discussions.
COMMENTS BAKER, "The program gives
the student a chance to seriously think about
things in an intellectual atmosphere. Ten to
twenty per cent of the students take full
and complete advantage of the possibilities
of the program, while almost all are drawn
into it effectively."
"The program would have to be extended
to the rest of the University. As the upper
classmen are not involved in the resident
program, it is not a thing of major im
portance to them. As the upperclassmen in
fluence the opinions of the freshmen, if is
important that the system be incorporated
Ihi ouglu in the I nivei sity."

activities, as faculty resident he need only
provide advice as opposed to initiative.
THOMAS SUGGESTED that the program
could be improved by enlarging the faculty
associate program from its present size of
four faculty members to a house to at least
six or eight. The main problem, he feels, is
the fact that the small resident cottages don't
account for growing faculty families. As

truly helpful, cramped conditions force him
to leave.

says he is available for any type of counsel
ing "short (>I motherhood and psychiatry."
Trying to avoid regularly scheduled activi

ties, he feels the frosh are pressed for time
and resent having to attend, for reasons of
courtesy, planned functions.

one around to consult at times of late hour

six or eight. The main problem, he feels, is
the fact that the small resident cottages don't
account for growing faculty families. As
soon as a resident ha* been working a year
or two and has gained the experience to be
truly helpful, cramped conditions force him
to leave.
As a resident at Rineonada Richard Kraus
feels the first quarter is occupied in getting
to know the 90 boys in his charge at some
thing deeper than a mere superficial level
of greeting. Inviting the boys over for reg
ular Sunday afternoons at his cottage, Kraus
says he is available for any type of counsel
ing "short (>I motherhood and psychiatry."
Trying to avoid regularly scheduled activi

ties, he feels the frosh are pressed for time
and resent having to attend, for reasons of
courtesy, planned functions.
ONK OF THE MAIN advantages of the
program, Kraus says, is always having some
one around to consult at times of late hour
desperation. Agreeing with Thomas, he
states, "The best fruit of the program comes
from the bull sessions around the dinner
table. All you have to do is have a good per
son in the job, then (the resident program)
will run effectively." Once again the limited
living quarters were cited as a deterent of
the program.
Trancos' Marshall Baker feels that one of
the major activities he has undertaken this
quarter is having the boys invite represent
atives of various university departments to
the cottage on Monday nights for informal
talks and discussions.
COMMENTS BAKER, "The program gives
the student a chance to seriously think about
things in an intellectual atmosphere. Ten to
twenty per cent of the students take full
and complete advantage of the possibilities
of the program, while almost all are drawn
into it effectively."
"The program would have to be extended
to the rest of the University. As the upper
classmen are not involved in the resident
program, it is not a thing of major im
portance to them. As the upperclassmen in
fluence the opinions of the freshmen, if is
important that the system be incorporated
Ihi ouglu in the I nivei sity."
Stanford's gradual growth in numbers over
iho years has, inevitably, brought with it
i growth of the gap between the student and
t lie professor. The evolution of these groups
! as "Two distinct bodies lias continued, if not
unnoticed then unchanged, for several years.
Gradual recognition of the fruits of educa
! lion being lost by restricting relationships to
the classroom has resulted in what has finally
j emerged as the faculty resident and associate
! programs.
THJO FIRST STKI" in the program came in
1955 when Wilbur Hall was constructed with
the inclusion of adjoining housing facilities
for eight faculty members and their families.
Lagunita Court, then an all sophomore resi
dence, served as Ihe experimental cite for the
faculty associate program, which included
twenty members at its onset.
As of May 1959, with the program but one
! year old, the consensus of student opinion
termed the activities worthwhile, but showing
a need to be carried further. The faculty felt
the program successful, but too new to be
evaluated.
LAVVHi:NC K THOMAS, present faculty
resident at Wilbur's Madera House is a vet
eran of the program. Feeling that personal
contact at meals is one of the prime sources
of accomplishment, Thomas encourages his
boys to drop in informally when the light is
on outside his cottage. Otherwise the Wilbur
i residents know he is busy, an I should be

called upon only in cases of urgent need. By
sitting down and talking with the elected of
ficers of the group, he acts as witness and
historian of what has gone before, thereby
providing the officers with experience upon
which to build.
Thomas believes the attitude of accepting
responsibility for managing their own af
fairs is most prevelant in (lie present set of
freshmen. He feels this maturity would be
much less without the benefit of the sponsor
and resident program. With the students
planning their own intellectual and cultural
activities, as faculty resident he need only
provide advice as opposed to initiative.
THOMAS SUGGESTED that the program
could be improved by enlarging the faculty
associate program from its present size of
four faculty members to a house to at least
six or eight. The main problem, he feels, is
the fact that the small resident cottages don't
account for growing faculty families. As
soon as a resident ha* been working a year
or two and has gained the experience to be
truly helpful, cramped conditions force him
