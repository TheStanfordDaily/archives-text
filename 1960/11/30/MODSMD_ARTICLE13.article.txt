## Women Get Violent Over Segregation 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (UPI> Snarling housewives trying to enforce a white student boycott attacked
a white woman yesterday when -she picked her daughter up after classes in an intergrated school.
About a dozen women, howling curses and profanity, set upon Mrs. Jesse Gabrille after she came
out of William Frantz Elementary School with her 6-year-old daughter Yolanda.
Yoianda was attending classes in the building with three other white students and one Negro girl,

a rise of two white students in
attendance over Monday.
A WHITE boycott at McDon
ogh 19 remained complete, with
only three Negro girls in the
buolding. The girls arrived and
left the school almost unnoticed.
All four are 6-year-olds in the
first grade.
A crowd of about 40 women,
who earlier shoved and cursed a
white minister taking his child to
class, jeered the Negro girl when
she left Frantz and then stayed
to heckle the white students.
Mrs. Gabrille and Yolanda left
by the back door of the school,
but a group of women were wait
ing for them across the street.
When Mrs. Gabrille tried to push
her way through the crowd, the
women began shoving and hit
ting her.
"This is what the Communists
want to see." she said. "I don't
want the whole world to think we
are all like that."
SHE SAID she intended to take
Yolanda back to school in the
morning. "We just want to be
left alone," she said.
"I don't understand it. Some of
these people I thought were my
friends." Police made no arrests.
Police at Franzt School had to
clear a path through screaming
women so that the Rev. Andrew
Foreman, a Methodist minister,
could take his 5-year-old daugh
ter, Pamela Lynn, to her kinder
garten class.
The women tried to form a wall
to keep Foreman and his daugh
ter from crossing the street to
the school, but police got them
through. Foreman said later he
didn't know "what they might
trv to do."

to heckle the white students.
Mrs. Gabrille and Yolanda left
by the back door of the school,
but a group of women were wait
ing for them across the street.
When Mrs. Gabrille tried to push
her way through the crowd, the
women began shoving and hit
ting her.
"This is what the Communists
want to see." she said. "I don't
want the whole world to think we
are all like that."
SHE SAID she intended to take
Yolanda back to school in the
morning. "We just want to be
left alone," she said.
"I don't understand it. Some of
these people I thought were my
friends." Police made no arrests.
Police at Franzt School had to
clear a path through screaming
women so that the Rev. Andrew
Foreman, a Methodist minister,
could take his 5-year-old daugh
ter, Pamela Lynn, to her kinder
garten class.
The women tried to form a wall
to keep Foreman and his daugh
ter from crossing the street to
the school, but police got them
through. Foreman said later he
didn't know "what they might
trv to do."

a rise of two white students in
attendance over Monday.

only three Negro girls in the
buolding. The girls arrived and
left the school almost unnoticed.
All four are 6-year-olds in the
first grade.
A crowd of about 40 women,
who earlier shoved and cursed a
white minister taking his child to
class, jeered the Negro girl when
she left Frantz and then stayed
to heckle the white students.
