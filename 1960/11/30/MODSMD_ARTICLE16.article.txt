# ‘Operation Abolition'

### 
"Operation Abolition," a film produced by tlie House Un-
American Activities Committee to prove that the San Francisco
riots last spring were Communist inspired anil Communist led, is
simply marvelous.
The film Iras been playing in the area, so w hen three Daily stafT
members heard it was to be shown in Palo Alto Monday night,
they just had to allend and discover for themselves if the riots
had been Communist inspired and led. After viewing the film
there is simply no doubt about it—the riols were Communist agi
tated and Communist led.
Every loyal American should stand up and give a cheer for the
HUAC which protects us from the insidious conspiracy which is
growing daily within our borders.
It is quite obvious after viewing "Operation Abolition"' that
the students who protested the hearings are Communist dupes—
they were not there to protest the un-American activities of the
HUAC as you would he led to believe if you asked the students.
They were there because Communist agents had visited their cam
puses and had lodged an unwarranted hatred in their minds toward
that patriotic body of men who are protecting us.
Of course, the film w r as a little biased; as a matter of fact, it
did not contain one iota of objectivity, but then the students were
not very objective either. You would have to call the film a propa
ganda vehicle rather than an educational endeavor, something
which does not coincide with previous HUAC statements that this
noble body is concerned only with facts.
But then, we should ignore this one fallacy since the film does
prove, even without resorting to facts, that the riots were Com
munist inspired and Communist led. Actually, the HUAC prob
ably considers the use of facts a little passe since the subjective
evidence is overwhelming.
The writer of this editorial was present at the hearings as a
reporter and left with a different impression than the one depicted
in the film. But it is quite likely that reporters can at first analyze
the hearings objectively, but then fall prey to Communist agita
tion as did the students.
We hope that everyone sees this film so they will discover as
we did just how the Communists can take normally apathetic stu
dents and then mold them into rabid, psychotic madmen who
have been robbed of the normal processes of reasoning. Once
again, may we congratulate the House Un-American Activities
Committee for an excellent, if somewhat biased expose of the
Communist inspired, Communist led San Francisco demonstrations
last spring.

had been Communist inspired and led. After viewing the film
there is simply no doubt about it—the riols were Communist agi
tated and Communist led.
Every loyal American should stand up and give a cheer for the
HUAC which protects us from the insidious conspiracy which is
growing daily within our borders.
It is quite obvious after viewing "Operation Abolition"' that
the students who protested the hearings are Communist dupes—
they were not there to protest the un-American activities of the
HUAC as you would he led to believe if you asked the students.
They were there because Communist agents had visited their cam
puses and had lodged an unwarranted hatred in their minds toward
that patriotic body of men who are protecting us.
Of course, the film w r as a little biased; as a matter of fact, it
did not contain one iota of objectivity, but then the students were
not very objective either. You would have to call the film a propa
ganda vehicle rather than an educational endeavor, something
which does not coincide with previous HUAC statements that this
noble body is concerned only with facts.
But then, we should ignore this one fallacy since the film does
prove, even without resorting to facts, that the riots were Com
munist inspired and Communist led. Actually, the HUAC prob
ably considers the use of facts a little passe since the subjective
evidence is overwhelming.
The writer of this editorial was present at the hearings as a
reporter and left with a different impression than the one depicted
in the film. But it is quite likely that reporters can at first analyze
the hearings objectively, but then fall prey to Communist agita
tion as did the students.
We hope that everyone sees this film so they will discover as
we did just how the Communists can take normally apathetic stu
dents and then mold them into rabid, psychotic madmen who
have been robbed of the normal processes of reasoning. Once
again, may we congratulate the House Un-American Activities
Committee for an excellent, if somewhat biased expose of the
Communist inspired, Communist led San Francisco demonstrations
last spring.
"Operation Abolition," a film produced by tlie House Un-
American Activities Committee to prove that the San Francisco
riots last spring were Communist inspired anil Communist led, is
simply marvelous.
The film Iras been playing in the area, so w hen three Daily stafT
members heard it was to be shown in Palo Alto Monday night,
they just had to allend and discover for themselves if the riots
had been Communist inspired and led. After viewing the film
