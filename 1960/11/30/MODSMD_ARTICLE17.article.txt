BY JAMES MAINA
Allow me to pose a few ques
tions in your series of articles
about Africa by Peter Duignan.
As an African and a student in
terested in African-American re
lations, I am compelled to ask the
questionâ€”what CONTRIBUTION
has he offered toward better re
lations between the peoples of
Africa and the United States?
Having gone through para
graphs of academic parallelism
and unfortunate contradictions, I
could only find one answer to my
question. Unless the second con
tribution is safely hidden in the
atomic word "gleichgeschaitet"
(the meaning of which I could
not find), Duignan's only contri
bution is this:
"What is needed is flexibility,
realism and above all avoidance
of the view that American policy
must somehow or other be ideo
logical gleichgeschaitet." Duignan
gives examples to explain what
he means by flexibility and real-
Ism, but since he does not exem
plify his other magic word, I will
confine myself to flexibility and
realism.
To explain flexibility and real
ism he says for example: "Israel
enjoys perfectly amicable rela
tions with Ghana and South Af
rica alike. The Soviet Union sup
ports a "fuedaJLsfc regime in Af
ghanistan, an emergent "national
bourgeoisie" in Egypt and a party
bureaucracy in Albania."
He unfortunately and I think
deliberately, forgot to mention
that the United States enjoys per
fectly amicable relations with
Ghana and South Africa. He for
got to mention that the United
States supports and is wholly re
sponsible for the government of
such dictators as Chiang Kai-
Shek, Trujillo and, tintil recently,
Batista.
He forgot to mention that the
United States has supported a

"Firestone colony" called Liberia
in the name of democracy and
private enterprise. He forgot that
the Constitution of the United
States condemns segregation and
yet, as Dr. Gikonyo Kiano said
the other day: "Mississippi would
win with honors in a contest for
segregation and color prejudice."
Yes, in terms of flexibility and
realism the United States govern
ment is by far the most perfect.
If this is Duignan's contribution
it must be declared null and void.
On the question of multi-racial
ism he leaves the reader with a
doubtless conviction that South
Africa is what he happily calls
"the land of Verwoerd." lie does
not humbly Inform us that his is
but a speculative account; of a
perpetually explosive situation.
He does inform the African
Forum, for which the articles
were written, that what he calls
"local and irresponsible leader
ship" includes leaders like Chief
Luthuli who are so highly re
garded by everyone who knows
anything about South Africa.
Such an all-embracing general
ity is an academic naivete that
does nobody any good but does a
great injustice to people like
Chief Luthuli, Alan Paton, So
bukwe, Tambo and Bishop Am
brose Reeves.
The names of these men will
live for many centuries in South
Africa, and it is unfortunate they
were not worth a mention in
Duignan's scholarly presentation.
Duignan ends calling for a "lit
tle patience." I would have said
that the Africans have shown not
a "little patience," but a great
deal of patience. Since the 1890's
the Whites have had a completely
free hand in ruling Africa.
Today, when these Whites look
back to see what they have ac
complished in terms of education,
health and general welfare they
freely admit that "the Africans
are not ready for self-govern
ment." They forget that it is
solely their fault that we are
not ready, and that it is about
time they gave a chance to "some
body" else.
