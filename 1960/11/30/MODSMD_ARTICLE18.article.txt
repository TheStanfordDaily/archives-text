# De Gaulle's Alternatives
## 
### LARRY NEAL IIR Political Analyst 
TOURSâ€”General Do Gaulle's
announcement of a referendum
to be held in France by the mid
| die of January came as a surprise
to no one in this country. Ever
since the uprising in Algeria,
January, 1960, De Gaulle has
been driven toward this by forces
flanking him on all sides.
He finds himself now with only
one trump card, although it is
the most powerful in the deck.
For almost a year now, he has
been carefully laying the ground
work for action in Algeria: key
.spots in the army bureaucracy
have been shaken up, pledges of
support have been obtained from
all his aides, and 12 speaking
tours to over 40 departments of
France have been made.
His increasingly impassioned
appeals, "I need your help to
rule France," were climaxed by
the nationwide television-radio
address of Nov. 4. No one seems
to doubt that De Gaulle will ob
tain an overwhelming majority in
any referendum.
But. the referendum is not a
panacea for I)e Gaulle's problems
by any means. This is apparent
from the very care he has usee!
in preparing - for it; it is signifi
cant that he has carefully re
frained from mentioning it openly
until now.
As a consequence, De Gaulle
has a commanding head start
over his opposition in preparing
for a referendum show-down. The
growing power of Jacques Sou
stelle, the strong French Algeria
sentiment engendered by the
trial of Lagaillarde and company,
and the increasing impatience of
"la Gauche" as shown in the
"Declaration of the 121" have
forced the general to act now to
maintain his edge of power. He
must have a referendum before
the forces against him can fully
organize their strength.
There are a variety of ways De
Gaulle can initiate a referendum;
there are dangers in each.
He may dissolve the National
Assembly. This is possible if the
notion of censure now being made
against Prime Minister Debre is
passed. A second vote in the Na
tional Assembly on the "force de
Frappe" plan of De Gaulle is
necessary now after its rejection
by the Senate.
Debre has chosen, once again,
to stake his political life oil it and
demand that, either a motion of
censure be passed against bis
government or that the bill be
come law. His opponents liave
welcomed this decision. If the mo
tion of censure passes (which is
not impossible) De Gaulle would
likely dissolve the Assembly and

call for elections of new deputies
who supported liini.
But it is quite possible that his j
opponents would gain from such !
an election. Even if De Gaulle did
gain power in the Assembly he 1
would not have the strong per-j
sonal mandate he needs to make
the army acquiesce to a new Al-1
gerian policy.
He may ask for national ap- 1
proval by the people of a bill con-1
taining his Algerian program
(which he has carefully refrained '
from defining i. This would by
pass the Assembly and the Senate
completely. Also, it would solidify
the antagonism of the parlia
mentary opposition very seri
ously. As he mockingly said in
his address of Nov. 4, "They do
their job very well, but it is 1
who have the power." Still, lack j
of support by the Parliament (
would weaken the general's hand i
in dealing with the army.
Further, the spelling out of a
definite program would provide
a rallying point, not only for De
Gaulle, but also for the forces
of Soustelle, General Salan, and
troops.
lie may ask for a constitutional
amendment. Over a month ago, j
De Gaulle cautiously broached a
scheme to permit him to present {
messages personally to the Na
tional Assembly which would
have required changing Article
IB of the Constitution. The idea
was dropped after vigorous out-1
cries from powerful factions in
the Assembly, but it still has in
teresting possibilities.
Such an amendment must be
passed by a simple majority in
both the Assembly and the Sen-j
ate and then a simple majority ;
in a referendum or by three-fifths
of the total membership of the
Parliament sitting in a Congress.
If De Gaulle did get such an
amendment through both cham
bers by means of his support in
the UNR and the center parties;
if he received overwhelming sup
port for the amendment (and for
his leadership) in the referen
dum; then, Le Grand Charles
could appear before the National
Assembly with an overpowering.
Napoleon-like mandate behind
him.
The Parliament almost cer- j
tainly would acquiesce to his will,
as it lias always done before a
leader with a popular mandate, j
and I)e Gaulle would obtain per-1
mission to carry out an Algerian I
program on his own, unregulated
terms. This route has its attrac-!
tions for it would not require,
elaboration of the details of any ,
program. Hopefully, opposition to '
it would remain fragmented and i
impotent, as a result.
President De Gaulle, an ac-1
knowledged master of the art of;
political manipulation, must '
choose the correct means of em- i
ploying the referendum in the i
difficult, bloody days to come as ]
the Algerian affair moves into I
its denouement.
