Editor, the Daily:
Students with adequate educa
tional resources and in good
health will be more likely to
favor a Western view of society
than will students who are pov
erty-stricken and ill-supplied with
books and materials. Whether
one espouses internationalism or
America first, it is in our interest
to contribute to WUS. If genuine
generosity inspires the giving, so
much the better.
This year the Stanford WUS
Drive has a goal of $5,000, half of
which will be used in Africa.
Here, very clearly, our contem
poraries and through them our
own future will benefit. The WUS
Drive is a commendable enter
prise. It deserves the full atten
tion and support of the student
body.

With all due respect for your
fine, sophomoric blast against
Professor Merryman (who cer
tainly deserved a reply of some
kind), I cannot help wondering
how one goes about "casting dis
persions on a faculty member."
The word you seek is "asper
sions," is it not? The next, time
you feel you have something
worthwhile to say, kindly con
sult a dictionary and let us have
done with this Dogberrying.
