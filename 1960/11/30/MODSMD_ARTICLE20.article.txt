Editor, the Daily:
I should like to protest the
merciless joke at the expense
both of the Stanford Daily and of
the good reputation of John
Henry Merryman, Professor of
Law. Certainly no Stanford pro
fessor in his right mind would
refer to the sincere endeavors of
a colleague, indeed, of a brother
as it were, in such hyperbolic
tones. The phrase "vacuous
bathos" could only be the product
of an undergraduate mentality.
Students such as Mr. Bradley
or myself might be guilty of such
usage, but never a distinguished
professor in the Law School. The
Daily staff should at once muster
its forces to discover the scoun
drel so that Professor Merryman
may bo vindicated and also the
high standard of journalistic ex
cellence typical of the Daily. I
believe that I speak for many
students when I request some
trenchant editorial comment in
this matter.
Keid Condit
Editor, the Daily:
Once again our indomitable
editor (or one of his equally co
herent colleagues), has disposed
of several issues simultaneously
with a few deft strokes of his dis
persion-casting pen. He has up
held the doctrine that articulate
members of the faculty should

stay where they belong, safely I
out of contact with the under
graduate student body.
He has, in this time of worry, I
provided invaluable reassurance i
to troubled freshmen, demon
strating that if they will regard!
their newspaper as a reflection of
Stanford standards of taste and
literacy, they can forget all fears !
of inability to measure up.
There is little cause to doubt
that our editors will continue to i
exert their enlightened influence,'
and if a solitary professor in the
Law School, with a long and de
risive chuckle, road the Daily for
the last lime yesterday morning,
who cares? Our only regret is
that, faced with such competition, j

the Chaparral, Stanford's other
humor publication, may be forced
out of existence.

risive chuckle, road the Daily for
the last lime yesterday morning,
who cares? Our only regret is
that, faced with such competition, j

the Chaparral, Stanford's other
humor publication, may be forced

Editor, the Daily:
I should like to protest the
merciless joke at the expense
both of the Stanford Daily and of
the good reputation of John
Henry Merryman, Professor of
Law. Certainly no Stanford pro
fessor in his right mind would
refer to the sincere endeavors of
a colleague, indeed, of a brother
as it were, in such hyperbolic
tones. The phrase "vacuous
bathos" could only be the product
of an undergraduate mentality.
Students such as Mr. Bradley
or myself might be guilty of such
usage, but never a distinguished
professor in the Law School. The
Daily staff should at once muster
its forces to discover the scoun
drel so that Professor Merryman
may bo vindicated and also the
high standard of journalistic ex
cellence typical of the Daily. I
believe that I speak for many
students when I request some
trenchant editorial comment in
this matter.
Keid Condit
Editor, the Daily:
Once again our indomitable
editor (or one of his equally co
herent colleagues), has disposed
of several issues simultaneously
with a few deft strokes of his dis
persion-casting pen. He has up
held the doctrine that articulate
members of the faculty should

stay where they belong, safely I
out of contact with the under
graduate student body.
He has, in this time of worry, I
provided invaluable reassurance i
to troubled freshmen, demon
strating that if they will regard!
their newspaper as a reflection of
Stanford standards of taste and
literacy, they can forget all fears !
of inability to measure up.
There is little cause to doubt
that our editors will continue to i
exert their enlightened influence,'
and if a solitary professor in the
Law School, with a long and de
risive chuckle, road the Daily for
the last lime yesterday morning,
who cares? Our only regret is
that, faced with such competition, j

the Chaparral, Stanford's other
humor publication, may be forced
out of existence.
