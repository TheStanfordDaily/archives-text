# Problem of Hyphenated Citizenship
## 
### BUSTER BROWN 
The Arab-Israeli dispute, and
the whole Palestine problem, is
one of the world's critical situa
tions. The fundamental questions
in the Palestine problem*;—his
torically have been the right of
immigration, land ownership, and
control, and the Holy places.
These fundamentals remain the
unresolved aspects of the prob
lems today, under the captions
of Arab refugees, borders, and
the status of Jerusalem.
The single, most basic element
preventing resolution of these
issues has been historically—and
remains—whether these ques
tions can, and will, be settled in
terms of equity for the people in
Palestine; or whether a so-called
"Jewish people-—which in Zionist
and Israeli terminology means
all Jews, regardless of their legal
citizenship in many nations—are
to be regarded as possessing
rights and discharging responsi
bilities which must be taken into
account in any settlement.
The "American Council for
Judaism" is an organization of
anti-Zionist United States citizens
of Jewish faith. This group recog
nizes the State of Israel as a fact
of history; and they share a
spiritual fellowship with those
citizens of Israel of Jewish faith.
However, they deny that any
spiritual fellowship with Israeli
citizens of Jewish faith implies or
requires any national commit
ment to Israeli national interests
or politics.
This fundamental position, Ihey
feel, is that of normal American
citizens in their attitudes towards
the relations between our own
country and any foreign nation.
It is precisely here that anti-
Zionism becomcs an operative
ideology for Americans of Jew

ish faith; for by anti-Zionism
they (the American Council of
Judaism) mean the rejection of
the Zionist concept that all Jews,
regardless of their legal citizen
ship—because they are Jews—be
long to a common nationality,
with a special national relation
ship to the State of Israel. Identi
fication as a Jew is by virtue of
voluntary association with Juda
ism, a religious faith, and with
Judaism's spiritual fellowship.
The State of Israel should be
regarded—and should regard it
self—as the "homeland" of only
its own citizens, regardless of
race or creed.
In identical letters to both Vice
President Nixon and Senator Ken
nedy before their fourth televi
sion debate. Dr. Elmer Berger,
executive vice president of the

Council, declared that it is time {
for the government to insist, on
behalf of its Jewish citizens,
"upon the integrity of their na-;
tionality-status and of their re-!
ligious faith by denying the ap
plicability of Israel's policy of
'Jewish' nationalism to these
Americans."
On Thursday, January 12, at
4:15, Dr. Berger will speak in
Cubberley Auditorium on the
question of the political and na
tionality status of U.S. Jews being
prejudiced by the activities of the
State of Israel and its agents.
His address is being sponsored
by Pi Sigma Alpha, the National
Political Science Honor Society,
and the Project for International
Studies in Conflict and Integra
tion, under the directorship of (
Professor Robert North.
