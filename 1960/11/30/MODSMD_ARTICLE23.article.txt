NOUAKCTIOTT, M a u r i t a n i a
I (UPI) The era of French
colonial rule in Sub-Sahara Afri
ca ended at the stroke of mid
night Sunday night when Mauri
tania took its place as the world's
newest nation.
Independence celebrations,
marked in this •shanty-town capi
tal by the slaughtering of sacri
ficial sheep, were shadowed by a
strong protest from neighboring
, Morocco which claims all of
' Mauritania as Moroccan.
THE MOROCCAN Government !
i ordered all cafes, movies and,
movies and other places of en
icrtainment closed throughout
Saturday in a show of mourning !
md "symp iihv" with pro Moiw i
j -an Mauritani'ins.
Diplomats from more than '.li)
foreign countries, including tho
United Stales, who gathered in
I Nouakchott for the self-rule cere- 1
! monies, took no official notice of;
! the Moroccan position.
They applauded as French rep
resentatives formally t u r n e rl I
over control to a pro-Western
government headed by Prime I
j Minister Moktar Ould Daddah I
and thus gave up the last French 1
; colony in Africa south of the
i Sahara.
Ould Daddah, 33, already has

negotiated a $32 million loan
from tHe International Bank of I
Reconstruction and Development
during a trip to Washington j
earlier this year and is -seeking
more International aid to tide his
country through tho first years
of sovereignty.
THK PRIMITIVE, nomadic ter
ritory, half again the size of
Texas, is known to harbor great
mineral wealth including possi-

ble stores of uranium—which
have barely been tapped. Its pre
dominantly Islamic population of

about 800,000 currently eke out
a meager existence in a crude
agrarian economy.
