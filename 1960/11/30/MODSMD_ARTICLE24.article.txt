## On Other Campi 
### 
In a bylined article in the No
vember 3 issue of the Wall Street
Journal. John Chamberlain writes
that "the young college genera
tions of America may be at the
beginning of another big politi
cal swing, this time away from
Ihe State-Welfarist political ideas
that have dominated campus dis
cussions since FDR first tilted
his cigaret holder at a rakish
angle and said, "My friends."
W rite s Chamberlain, "The
scene might be any of 200 college
town bookstores in the United
States, but in this instance it
happens to he Whit lock's, a New
Haven. Conn., bookshop within a
stone's throw of the Yale Uni
versity Library. Two undergrad
uates are asking for "The Con
science of a Conservative," by
Senator Barry Goldwater. The
clerk is interested; he wants to
know if it is assigned class read
ing. No, say the students, they
are acting on their own; they
have been hearing things about
the Senator's ideas on freedom."
"The incident might be dis
missed as routine if it were not
for the f'aet that within a two
month span of time publisher
Alex Hillman of New York has
had to order new lots of the
paperbacked edition on eight sep
arate occasions, with 50,000 going
out to the newspaper stands and
bookstores at a clip." A large pro
portion of the sales, which now
approach 500,000, have been in
colleke towns.
. . four years from now,
eight years from now, 12 years
from now, the pressure on the
old parties from the young pre
cinct workers and convention del
egates may tell a different story.
The 'new' radicalism a radical
ism which looks with favor on
more freedom and responsibility
for individuals and more power
over taxes and spending for local
political units—is already on the
attack in college communities."
At the University of Wisconsin,
once the strong-hold of the La
Folletes, faculty members who
"look with nostalgia on the 'prog
ressivism' of the Twenties and
the New Deal of the Thirties" still
persist, but have come under at
tack recently from a new under
graduate magazine. "Insight and
Outlook." At Yale, the Calliopean
Society, once a small band of
conservative die-hards, has had
to limit its membership, and at
the University of Mississippi,
students have joined forces to
publish "The Campus Conserva
tive."
And perhaps the most surpris
ing development of all, students
at Harvard recently elected a cru
sading conservative as student
body president.
Chamberlain noted that it is at
Harvard where "Fair Dealing pro
fessors, historian Arthur Schles
inger Jr., and economist J. Ken
neth Galbraith, carry on the tra
dition of the old radicalism." It
was Galbraith who said in effect
in his hook. "The Affluent So
ciety." that the American consu
mer is too stupid to know how to
spend his money and that the
government should allocate it for
him. He has been backed up by
Schlesinger who stated, "We have

1o abandon the illusion that the
free choices of millions of indi
vidual consumers can solve all of
our problems."
And then there is Seymour
Harris, who wrote in his book
"Economic Planning," "It is in
deed unfortunate that Americans
know so little about the planned
society. In this quasi-war world,
a planned society may be .just
around the corner. Even in a
peaceful world, the survival of a
capitalist society ... is not prob
able. Capitalism may well be but
a stage in the historical process
from feudalism to socialism."
It should be noted that all three
of these men —Schlcsinger, Gal
bruith, and Harris —are top ad
visors to President-Meet Kennedy
an<l that Galbraith has an excel
lent chance of becoming Secre
tary of Treasury.
It is litle wonder then that con
servative sentiment is being
aroused on campuses across the
nation? It was such ideas as
these, held by men in positions
of influence, that led in part to
the establishment of the Young
Americans for Freedom. To Mr.
Kennedy and his team of eco
nomic planners, they have an
swered:
"We, as young conservatives,
believe: That foremost among
the transcendent values is the in
dividual's use of his God-given
free will, whence derives his right
to he free from the restrictions of
arbitrary force; that liberty is
indivisible, and that political free
dom cannot long exist without
economic freedom; that the pur
poses of government are to pro
tect these freedoms through the
preservation of internal order,
the provision of national defense,
and the administration of justice;
that when government ventures
beyond these rightful functions,
it accumulates power which tends
to diminish order and libertv."

conservative die-hards, has had
to limit its membership, and at
the University of Mississippi,
students have joined forces to
publish "The Campus Conserva

And perhaps the most surpris
ing development of all, students
at Harvard recently elected a cru
sading conservative as student
body president.
Chamberlain noted that it is at
Harvard where "Fair Dealing pro
fessors, historian Arthur Schles
inger Jr., and economist J. Ken
neth Galbraith, carry on the tra
dition of the old radicalism." It
was Galbraith who said in effect
in his hook. "The Affluent So
ciety." that the American consu
mer is too stupid to know how to
spend his money and that the
government should allocate it for
him. He has been backed up by
Schlesinger who stated, "We have

1o abandon the illusion that the
free choices of millions of indi
vidual consumers can solve all of
our problems."
And then there is Seymour
Harris, who wrote in his book
"Economic Planning," "It is in
deed unfortunate that Americans
know so little about the planned
society. In this quasi-war world,
a planned society may be .just
around the corner. Even in a
peaceful world, the survival of a
capitalist society ... is not prob
able. Capitalism may well be but
a stage in the historical process
from feudalism to socialism."
It should be noted that all three
of these men —Schlcsinger, Gal
bruith, and Harris —are top ad
visors to President-Meet Kennedy
an<l that Galbraith has an excel
lent chance of becoming Secre
tary of Treasury.
It is litle wonder then that con
servative sentiment is being
aroused on campuses across the
nation? It was such ideas as
these, held by men in positions
of influence, that led in part to
the establishment of the Young
Americans for Freedom. To Mr.
Kennedy and his team of eco
nomic planners, they have an
swered:
"We, as young conservatives,
believe: That foremost among
the transcendent values is the in
dividual's use of his God-given
free will, whence derives his right
to he free from the restrictions of
arbitrary force; that liberty is
indivisible, and that political free
dom cannot long exist without
economic freedom; that the pur
poses of government are to pro
tect these freedoms through the
preservation of internal order,
the provision of national defense,
and the administration of justice;
that when government ventures
beyond these rightful functions,
it accumulates power which tends
to diminish order and libertv."

that "the young college genera

tect these freedoms through the
preservation of internal order,

and the administration of justice;
that when government ventures
beyond these rightful functions,
it accumulates power which tends
to diminish order and libertv."
In a bylined article in the No
vember 3 issue of the Wall Street
Journal. John Chamberlain writes
that "the young college genera
tions of America may be at the
beginning of another big politi
cal swing, this time away from
Ihe State-Welfarist political ideas
that have dominated campus dis
cussions since FDR first tilted
his cigaret holder at a rakish
angle and said, "My friends."
W rite s Chamberlain, "The
scene might be any of 200 college
town bookstores in the United
States, but in this instance it
happens to he Whit lock's, a New
Haven. Conn., bookshop within a
stone's throw of the Yale Uni
versity Library. Two undergrad
uates are asking for "The Con
science of a Conservative," by
Senator Barry Goldwater. The
clerk is interested; he wants to
know if it is assigned class read
ing. No, say the students, they
are acting on their own; they
have been hearing things about
the Senator's ideas on freedom."
"The incident might be dis
missed as routine if it were not
for the f'aet that within a two
month span of time publisher
Alex Hillman of New York has
had to order new lots of the
paperbacked edition on eight sep
arate occasions, with 50,000 going
out to the newspaper stands and
bookstores at a clip." A large pro
portion of the sales, which now
approach 500,000, have been in
colleke towns.
. . four years from now,
eight years from now, 12 years
from now, the pressure on the
old parties from the young pre
cinct workers and convention del
egates may tell a different story.
The 'new' radicalism a radical
ism which looks with favor on
more freedom and responsibility
for individuals and more power
over taxes and spending for local
political units—is already on the
attack in college communities."
At the University of Wisconsin,
once the strong-hold of the La
Folletes, faculty members who
"look with nostalgia on the 'prog
ressivism' of the Twenties and
the New Deal of the Thirties" still
persist, but have come under at
tack recently from a new under
graduate magazine. "Insight and
Outlook." At Yale, the Calliopean
Society, once a small band of
conservative die-hards, has had
to limit its membership, and at
the University of Mississippi,
students have joined forces to
publish "The Campus Conserva
tive."
And perhaps the most surpris
ing development of all, students
at Harvard recently elected a cru
sading conservative as student
body president.
Chamberlain noted that it is at
Harvard where "Fair Dealing pro
fessors, historian Arthur Schles
inger Jr., and economist J. Ken
neth Galbraith, carry on the tra
dition of the old radicalism." It
was Galbraith who said in effect
in his hook. "The Affluent So
ciety." that the American consu
mer is too stupid to know how to
spend his money and that the
government should allocate it for
him. He has been backed up by
Schlesinger who stated, "We have

1o abandon the illusion that the
free choices of millions of indi
vidual consumers can solve all of
our problems."
And then there is Seymour
Harris, who wrote in his book
"Economic Planning," "It is in
deed unfortunate that Americans
know so little about the planned
society. In this quasi-war world,
a planned society may be .just
around the corner. Even in a
peaceful world, the survival of a
capitalist society ... is not prob
able. Capitalism may well be but
a stage in the historical process
from feudalism to socialism."
It should be noted that all three
of these men —Schlcsinger, Gal
bruith, and Harris —are top ad
visors to President-Meet Kennedy
an<l that Galbraith has an excel
lent chance of becoming Secre
tary of Treasury.
It is litle wonder then that con
servative sentiment is being
aroused on campuses across the
nation? It was such ideas as
these, held by men in positions
of influence, that led in part to
the establishment of the Young
Americans for Freedom. To Mr.
Kennedy and his team of eco
nomic planners, they have an
swered:
"We, as young conservatives,
believe: That foremost among
the transcendent values is the in
dividual's use of his God-given
free will, whence derives his right
to he free from the restrictions of
arbitrary force; that liberty is
indivisible, and that political free
dom cannot long exist without
economic freedom; that the pur
poses of government are to pro
tect these freedoms through the
preservation of internal order,
the provision of national defense,
and the administration of justice;
that when government ventures
