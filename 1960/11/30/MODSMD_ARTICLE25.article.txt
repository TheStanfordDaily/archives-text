WASHINGTON (UPI) --An
American Medical Association
committee began work yesterday
on a proposal for a voluntary pre
paid national health insurance
program in the face of divergent
views with in its own ranks.
The difference of opinion was a
cause of concern among AMA
leaders who fear the government
may step in with a compulsory
plan if the Association does not
provide Ihe impetus for a volun
tary program.
The nationwide insurance plan
envisions one voluntary program
with the same coverage and rates,
rather than the present regional
setup under Blue Cross, Blue
Shield and commercial insurance
plans.
Presumably, any nationwide
plan also would tighten coverage
for the self-employed, the home
and office worker, and improve
insurance for mental illness.
