# Venezuelan Government Ends Leftist-Sponsored Street Riots
## 
### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (UPI)â€”
Government troops and tanks
drove leftist agitators into hiding
yesterday to end four days of
wild rioting.
The Army, called out by Presi
dent Romulo Betancourt on Mon
day to end the threat of civil war,
beat down repeated efforts by
Communist and pro-Castro ele
ments to renew the disorders in
which eight persons have been
killed and more Ihan 200
wounded. Police said 85 persons
had been arrested for investi
gation.
At least three persons were
killer! and 30 wounded in the first
six hours after army troops took
over street patrols in Caracas late
Monday. Stray shots were heard

throughout Iho city until nearly
dawn today as Army patrols
flushed out snipers.
First reports of similar disor
derly outbreaks in cities in the
interior were made public today,
but it was evident they never
reached the stage of almost open
warfare that prevailed in the
capital yesterday.
