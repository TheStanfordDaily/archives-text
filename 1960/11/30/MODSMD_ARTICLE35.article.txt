STANFORDIA DEPARTMENT (BIG GAME DIVISION): Events
of the last few days have indicated the need for tieing up a few loose
ends concerning the greatest stunt of this or any other year; the
BEAT CAE sign which hung for a few glorious minutes off the
Leaning Tower of Pisa. A little background information may he
necessary.
In the middle of October a letter was received from Florence in-

forming us that an assult upon
that world famous landmark was
going to be made the following
week with a sign which was al
ready in the making. What
should be done with the pictures
and information gathered there
from? The perpetrators of the
deed were determined to send a
copy of the picture to Life Maga
zine since they featured it on
the back page of that magazine,
the page usually reserved for
three-humped camels and the
like. Should they also send it to
the wire services or would the
Daily take care of it?
Approximately three minutes
and 12 seconds later a letter was
dispatched to the land of the
pizza saying that the Daily would
handle the distribution of the pic
ture and wishing the group all
sorts of good luck.

On Oct. 31, three 8 x 10 copies of that now familiar picture ar- j
rived at the Daily. One copy was sent to The Associated Press in
San Francisco and another was spread all over tlie front page of
the Daily the next morning. The day after it appeared in the Daily,
the picture found its way to every paper in Ihe Bay Area, most of
the papers in Southern California and many throughout the rest of!
the nation.
All Over the Place
It appeared on the-sports page of the New York Times and yester
day someone walked into the Daily Shack brandishing a copy of
the Nov. 2 edition of The Christian Science Monitor. It was on the
front page, which give us some small indication as to the movement
in the crypt of Mary Baker Eddy lately.
A couple of papers were a little disturbed about the affair. A
few guards at the tower had panicked upon seeing the sign and
thinking it was an Italian election stunt, hustled the sign hangers
off to the police station. Cries of damaged international relations
came from some papers. William Crosten, a Stanford music pro
lessor teaching the small group at Florence wrote back assuring
those concerned that the trouble had been quickly taken care of and
that Italy had not threatened to break off relations with the United
States.
At any rate another letter from Florence arrived yesterday want
ing to know why the Daily hadn't waited until Big Game week to
break the story. The answer, of course, is that we were greedy. We
wanted the story first and with a copy of the picture in the posses
sion of Henry R. Luce's employes, it had to go in the Daily right
away. Life, by the way. never used the picture. The only explanation |
we can offer is that they, too, had seen it in every paper they saw !
and figured that it had seen enough exposure.
Well, when they open Stanford in Moscow, we'll look for the 1
equal of this stunt; not before.
It Won't Happen Again
POETRY DEPARTMENT: Profuse and profound apologies for
the following are offered to Joyce Kilmer, readers of this column and
foliage in general. Basketball is love. We were carried away.
BASKETBALLS
I think that I could never wish
For a poem lovely as a swish,
Which from the shooter's hand doth fly
And in the netting gently lie;
Then fall so softly to the ground
With players standing all around,
While referee's their whistles blow
As fans suggest where ihey might go;
And coaches sit and dream of men
Who rise to heights of six foot len.
Poems are m.-ule and always will
But only Duke can pot the pill.

At any rate another letter from Florence arrived yesterday want
ing to know why the Daily hadn't waited until Big Game week to
break the story. The answer, of course, is that we were greedy. We
wanted the story first and with a copy of the picture in the posses
sion of Henry R. Luce's employes, it had to go in the Daily right
away. Life, by the way. never used the picture. The only explanation |
we can offer is that they, too, had seen it in every paper they saw !
and figured that it had seen enough exposure.
Well, when they open Stanford in Moscow, we'll look for the 1
equal of this stunt; not before.

BASKETBALLS
I think that I could never wish
For a poem lovely as a swish,
Which from the shooter's hand doth fly
And in the netting gently lie;
Then fall so softly to the ground
With players standing all around,
While referee's their whistles blow
As fans suggest where ihey might go;
And coaches sit and dream of men
Who rise to heights of six foot len.
Poems are m.-ule and always will
But only Duke can pot the pill.



THE LEANINC TOWER
. . . and decoration
STANFORDIA DEPARTMENT (BIG GAME DIVISION): Events
of the last few days have indicated the need for tieing up a few loose
ends concerning the greatest stunt of this or any other year; the
BEAT CAE sign which hung for a few glorious minutes off the
Leaning Tower of Pisa. A little background information may he
necessary.
In the middle of October a letter was received from Florence in-

forming us that an assult upon
that world famous landmark was
going to be made the following
week with a sign which was al
ready in the making. What
should be done with the pictures
and information gathered there
from? The perpetrators of the
deed were determined to send a
copy of the picture to Life Maga
zine since they featured it on
the back page of that magazine,
the page usually reserved for
three-humped camels and the
like. Should they also send it to
the wire services or would the
Daily take care of it?
Approximately three minutes
and 12 seconds later a letter was
dispatched to the land of the
pizza saying that the Daily would
handle the distribution of the pic
ture and wishing the group all
sorts of good luck.

On Oct. 31, three 8 x 10 copies of that now familiar picture ar- j
rived at the Daily. One copy was sent to The Associated Press in
San Francisco and another was spread all over tlie front page of
the Daily the next morning. The day after it appeared in the Daily,
the picture found its way to every paper in Ihe Bay Area, most of
the papers in Southern California and many throughout the rest of!
the nation.
All Over the Place
It appeared on the-sports page of the New York Times and yester
day someone walked into the Daily Shack brandishing a copy of
the Nov. 2 edition of The Christian Science Monitor. It was on the
front page, which give us some small indication as to the movement
in the crypt of Mary Baker Eddy lately.
A couple of papers were a little disturbed about the affair. A
few guards at the tower had panicked upon seeing the sign and
thinking it was an Italian election stunt, hustled the sign hangers
off to the police station. Cries of damaged international relations
came from some papers. William Crosten, a Stanford music pro
lessor teaching the small group at Florence wrote back assuring
those concerned that the trouble had been quickly taken care of and
that Italy had not threatened to break off relations with the United
States.
