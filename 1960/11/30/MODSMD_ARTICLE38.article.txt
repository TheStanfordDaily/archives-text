## 
### 
(UPI) â€” The West team that
takes the field against the East
in the 36ih annual Shrine classic
at Kezar Dec. 31 will have the
speed to offset the tremendous
weight advantage boas t e d by
their foes.
That was evident today in a
rundown of the West squad an
nounced by William M. Coffman,
managing director of the game.
The squad includes stars from 17
colleges.
BILL BARNES of UCLA, the
West's head coach, will have his
great triple-threat tailback Bill
Kilmer going as a quarterback
in this game. It is a position he
played in high school and junior
college, Richie Mayo of the Air
Force, another triple threater, will
alternate at the position.

Still a third Pacific Coast ace
i who can run, kick and pass, Keith
j Lincoln of Washington State, is
listed among the halfbacks. He
! and Kilmer have average close
to 42 yards in punting.
Glynn Gregory of Southern
| Methodist is rated one of the
fastest backs in the Southwest.
AT FULLBACK, Barnes and
his aides will have Skip Face,
Stanford's all-purpose performer,
and Tom Wat kins of lowa State.
Wat kins was the nation's second
leading rusher in 19159 and this
past campaign average close to
five yards per carry. Face was
the AAWU's leading pass re
ceiver.
Tackle Dean Hinshaw, another
'Card, will anchor the West line.
