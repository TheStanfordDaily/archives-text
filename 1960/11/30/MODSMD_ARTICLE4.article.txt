### KATHEE DOWNING 
"Multiracialism in Africa must
and will work," stated Geoffrey
Pardey, executive member of the
Central African Party, speaking
at the first meeting of llR's Afri
can Forum last night. Pardey
dealt with the transitional prob
lems of the African nations.
Pardey defined multiracialism
as "many races living together in
a nation forumed with individual
characteristics. Tribalism is ram
pant within the African nations."
said Pardey. "I feel everyone who
lives within Ihe territorial boun
daries of a nation should be united
irrespective of color.
"LACK of economic experience
is one of the major problems fac
ing the emerging African na
tions." Pardey felt. "There aren't
enough qualified men to fill the
jobs or to lead the countries. Now
tribal affiliation is more impor
tant than political responsibility.
"Though the Europeans must
surrender their positions of privi
lege, they must still supply need
eel guidance, if only the African
nations would accept it,"he
: added.
"Inlimidation and violence now
| exist," admitted Pardey. "Emo
tionalism and racialism replace
ordinary political negotiation. The
constitutions, which are now so
busily being written, must include
clauses which guarantee the
rights of the minorities."
I'AKDIOY also emphasized the
"vastly different" individual prob
lems of the African nations.
"Though this transitional period
is chaotic," concluded Pardey,
I "multiracialism and the building
up of these new nations has got
to work."

ister of Commerce and Industry,
