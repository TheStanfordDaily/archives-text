# Former WUS Director Cites How Funds Help
## 
### 
In Africa there is only one college graduate to every 78.000 citi
zens. This was pointed out by Paul Denise, a former World Univer
sity Service regional director from Philadelphia, when he spoke at
a meeting yesterday afternoon.
The meeting was the start for the week-long WUS drive to amass

$5,000 for World University Serv
ice projects. In view of this quar
ter's lIR focus on Africa, half of
the YVUS funds this year will go
to African students.
DKMSK, now a graduate stu
dent in sociology at (ho Univer
sity of California, stressed the
fact that the ratio of college grad
uates in Africa compares unfa
vorably to the Asian ratio of one
graduate to 2,800 people and the
United States ratio of one gradu
ate to every 55 people.
"VVUS," he stated, "works a
lot on the self-help theory. It is
interesting to note that all of tlie
money the U.S. branch of WUS
sends overseas is matched dollar
by dollar by the WUS organiza
tion in that country. This makes
WUS primarily a pump-primer,
which is what we want to be."
TJIK THEMK for the WUS
drive this year is that the money
given to WUS is an "investment
in the future." As an example of
its importance, Denise said, the
one university in South Africa for
native Africans has no typewriter
in the student body office. "Com
pare that with the set-up you
have here at Stanford," lie said,
"and giving a dollar to WUS
won't seem like enough!"
