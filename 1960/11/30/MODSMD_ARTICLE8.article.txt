## Drawings Lost For Gallery, Cancer Gun 
### 
Two architectural drawings for
priority projects on the campus,
amounting to over four months
work and valued at $800, are miss
ing from the Planning Office,
University officials said yester
day.
A search for the drawings has
been going on since Nov. 11, when
the loss was first discovered,
according to Planning Director
Harry Sanders. The drawings are
plans for additional shielding for
Ihc Medical School's linear accel
erator, known as the "Cancer
Gun," and for proposed renova
tions to the second floor gallery
of ihe Stanford Museum.
The loss possibly came in trans
fer of the drawings through the
inter-departmental mail system,
said Jeff Littleboy of News and
Publications, or in movement be
tween the Planning Office in En
cina and the Serra St. photo lab.
The Planning Office is appeal
ing to all on campus—depart
ments where the drawings may
have been mistakenly delivered,
students or staff members who
may have seen the brown-paper
wrapped, 3-foot-long roll to get
in touch with Sanders, Jack Lind
or anyone at the Planning Office
immediately.
The two projects will be held
up for six months if the drawings
have to be redone, Littleboy said.
The Museum renovation is a
$15,000 project, and the cancer
gun shield will be expensive also,
although exact costs won't be
known until the drawings can go
out for bids.
