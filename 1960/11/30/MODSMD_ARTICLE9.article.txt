### 
Currently there are 520 foreign
students enrolled at Stanford, ac
cording to a University survey.
This compares favorably with the
298 who were enrolled during fall
quarter of 1955, and 189 when the
program was launched in 1948.
Many of the graduate foreign
students earn small salaries as
departmental teaching assistants.
These and others who have sala
ried jobs may work after special
waivers have been obtained with
their visas.
