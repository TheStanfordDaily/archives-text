# WUS Official Speaks:
## 'Education Top Problem' Says Indian 
### JIM PYLKAS 
After participating in the Afri
can Forum last night, Dr. K. B.
Rao, WUS Regional Executive,
stated, "Al the present, the top
priority in Africa is education
and the biggest problem with that
seems to be a lack of understand
ing between the university edu
cated man and the non-university
educated man.
"This is a result of the many
different customs and languages
which the people have. For ex
ample, at the present, the Indian
in Africa is kept segregated by a
wall of bitterness." He added that
'WUS can help this situation
.hrough its program of education
and aid to education."
KAO SI'OKK with conviction
based on past experience with
WUS both in India and in the
U.S. Included in this experience
is the extensive traveling that he
has done for WUS. He has visited
over 320 colleges and universi
ties speaking about WUS. "And
I valued this experience very
highly," he said.
"Typical of the work that WUS
has done in India." according to
Siloo Mist r y, ASSU foreign
scholar, "is the investment it
made at Bombay University."
WUS donated money in an
amount equivalent in buying
power to $5,000 to the university
for textboks on the condition that
they raise an equal amount.
"These books were then to be
loaned to students for a nominal
fee."
TURNING to present WUS ac
tivities on the Farm, today finds
frosh dollies, sporting large iden
tification tags, soliciting for WUS
throughout the campus.
While much of the fund-raising
has been carried out in the indi
vidual living group*, many grad
students, professors, and off cam
pus residents have not been con
tacted.
These people and any others
who have not been contacted who
wish to do so may make checks
payable to "Stanford Relief
Fund" and send them to Steve
Foster at the lIR.
