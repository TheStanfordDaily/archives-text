## Revolution Spreads to Argentina 
### UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
The Latin American series of
brushfire revolutions hit Argen
tina yesterday.
The Argentine outbreak was
the sixth to involve Latin Ameri
can nations in the last two
months. Figuring prominently in
the reports were the new dictator
ship of Cuba's Fidel Castro and
; the old ones of former dictator
| Juan D. Peron of Argentina and
; Generalissimo Rafael Leonidas
| Trujillo of the Dominican Repub
lic.
This was yesterday's box score:
ARGENTIN A—The govern men t
1 blamed die-hard followers of Pe
ron for pre-dawn attacks on army
garrisons in two major cities. The
cities were Rosario, Argentina's
second largest, and Tartagal, an
oil center on the Bolivian border
1,100 miles from Buenos Aires.
Other attacks occurred in Puerto
Berghi and Vespuccio.
The government said the at
tackers had been repulsed with
casualties and were being pur
sued.
Simultaneous with the attacks
were two bomb blasts in Buenos
Aires and acts of sabotage against
rail and telephone lines in an ap
parent attempt to isolate Ihe re
volt area from the big army gar
risons in Buenos Aires and La
Plata.
VENEZUELA — The army ap
parently was bringing the situa
tion under control after nearly a
week of sporadic fighting which
the government charged was
sparked mainly by Communists
and Castro-oriented students.
However, outbursts of gunfire
continued. The army was purging
police units in worker's districts
of Caracas. The ousted police
were accused of participating in
street riots aimed at the over
throw of President Romula Bet
ancourt.
In a change of pace, the Vene
zuelan government also brought
charges before the Organization
of American States (OAS) that
the Trujillo government was aid
ing former officers of ousted dic
tator Marcos Perez Jimenez in a
plot against the regime.
