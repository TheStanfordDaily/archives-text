A problem lias arisen to which we can supply a solution. Ore
gon State College's football team lias been selected lo play.in the
Gotham Bowl in New York's Yankee Stadium on Dec. 10. The
problem is that they can't find an opponent.
First an invitation was extended to Holy Cross, but for some
mysterious reason it was withdrawn. Then the University of Colo
rado was given a bid, but they turned it down. Now the Gotham
Howl is really hurting for someone to play Oregon State. If they
can't find someone the game may have to be called off.
The solution lo the problem is obvious. There is only one
logical opponent for Oregon State . . . Stanford.
Tn so doing, Eastern fans and a television audience couhl see
a replay of the most exciting football game of llie season. Stan
ford's one victory of the season, against Oregon State, was turned
into defeat when a referee called a penaltv nullifying what would
have been the winning touchdown for the Indians.
That Stanford would really be out for blood goes without say
ing and a win in a rematch with Oregon State would save us from
our worst football season. Of course, if we lost we'd have a record
that no future Stanford team could ever duplicate, since few teams
that have lost all their games are asked to Howl games.
We wouldn't lose, though. Oregon State would be a cinch the
second time around.
