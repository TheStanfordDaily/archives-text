Editor, the Daily:
Merryman's attack on the Wat
kins' letter gives the impression
of concern merely for the articu
lation of the cause, alone and
apart from the merits of Watkins*
purpose. If the self-confidence of
students were of no concern to
Merryman, he might himself be
ill-fitted to be a teacher, and if
it is of consequence to him, then
by attacking one who attempts to
build it he shows more concern
for the shell than for the sub
stance.
In so approaching any problem
he does the legal profession a dis
service, and discourages those of
us who would be associated with
him in that field. A great many of
us have from time to time been
personally assisted, comforted,

and directed hy Dr. Watkins. That
Merryman should try 1o discour
age Watkins' singular and won
derful dedication is unfortunate.

Editor, the Daily:
I should like to protest the
merciless joke at the expense
both of the Stanford Daily and of
(he good reputation of Reid
Pierre Condit. Certainly no Stan
ford student in his right mind
would refer to the sincere en
deavors of a teacher, indeed, of
a father as it were, in such hy
perbolic tones.
The phrase "trenchant editorial
comment" could only be the prod
uct of a faculty mentality.
