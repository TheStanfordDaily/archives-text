## Avoiding the Point 
### 
The film "Operation Abolition" i
has the stated purpose of show-]
ing the fruits of Communist ac-!
tivity in the United States.
It shows students chanting,
singing and picketing the hear
' ings of the House Committee on
i Un-American Activities held in |
i San Francisco last spring. It
shows their "non-violent resist-j
ance" to the efforts of police of-1
| ficers and fire hoses to remove 1
them from the hall.
But the film, admitted by Sub-'
committee Investigator Wheeler j
to be an "exaggeration," does not j
| show, tell or even suggest WHY
the students were there.
The film says the demonstra
tions were inspired and led by top
Communist agitators and show
two admitted Communists, Archie
Brown and Merle Brodsky.as they
appeared at the hearings under
subpoena. It siiows several other
suspected Communists in the
committee room and outside the
hall.
But it does not show Commu
nists leading the chanting, direct
ing the picketing or holding mass
: meetings on nearby college cam
puses to organize the students.
Where were the Communist or
ganizers, then? By what means,
did they influence these "dupes
| and suckers?" And how did they
influence Ihem—by saying,
"Come! Let's disrupt the hear-1
ings and destroy the Committee
| so the Communists can take over
! the country?"
While the film makes a half
hearted attempt to pity these mis
guided students and to say that
without the influence of mass agi
! tation the students weren't so
ready to protest the Committee,
: it doesn't once get to the core of
j the matter—the reason so many
[students went of their own ac
; cord to City Hall and demonstra
j ted last May.
Certainly there were Commu
nist agitators present—for the
Communists are known to take
advantage of every situation that
arises from a desire to change
some aspect of time-honored
American life. But for by far the
most part, the demonstrators
1 went NOT to aid the Communist
cause but to protest validly the
workings of the Committee.
While the film exaggerates, it
neglects something even more im
portant—something the Commit
tee itself is certainly never going !
to bring up the question of va
lidity and purpose of the HUAC.
The official function of the
HUAC is to investigate all Com
munist activities in the U.S. and j
make recommendations to Con- ,
' gres-s. It has no legislative power I

in itself and no judicial power.
Yet the Committee uncovers no
new information in these open
hearings, nor does it succeed in
forcing its witnesses to "confess"
to Communist activity. Thus, in
it« present form, the Committee's
purpose seems to be to hold hear
ings and bring its witnesses into
the public eve.

The film "Operation Abolition" i
has the stated purpose of show-]
ing the fruits of Communist ac-!
tivity in the United States.
It shows students chanting,
singing and picketing the hear
' ings of the House Committee on
i Un-American Activities held in |
i San Francisco last spring. It
shows their "non-violent resist-j
ance" to the efforts of police of-1
| ficers and fire hoses to remove 1
them from the hall.
But the film, admitted by Sub-'
committee Investigator Wheeler j
to be an "exaggeration," does not j
| show, tell or even suggest WHY
the students were there.
The film says the demonstra
tions were inspired and led by top
Communist agitators and show
two admitted Communists, Archie
Brown and Merle Brodsky.as they
appeared at the hearings under
subpoena. It siiows several other
suspected Communists in the
committee room and outside the
hall.
But it does not show Commu
nists leading the chanting, direct
ing the picketing or holding mass
: meetings on nearby college cam
puses to organize the students.
Where were the Communist or
ganizers, then? By what means,
did they influence these "dupes
| and suckers?" And how did they
influence Ihem—by saying,
"Come! Let's disrupt the hear-1
ings and destroy the Committee
| so the Communists can take over
! the country?"
While the film makes a half
hearted attempt to pity these mis
guided students and to say that
without the influence of mass agi
! tation the students weren't so
ready to protest the Committee,
: it doesn't once get to the core of
j the matter—the reason so many
[students went of their own ac
; cord to City Hall and demonstra
j ted last May.
Certainly there were Commu
nist agitators present—for the
Communists are known to take
advantage of every situation that
arises from a desire to change
some aspect of time-honored
American life. But for by far the
most part, the demonstrators
1 went NOT to aid the Communist
cause but to protest validly the
workings of the Committee.
While the film exaggerates, it
neglects something even more im
portant—something the Commit
tee itself is certainly never going !
to bring up the question of va
lidity and purpose of the HUAC.
The official function of the
HUAC is to investigate all Com
munist activities in the U.S. and j
make recommendations to Con- ,
' gres-s. It has no legislative power I

in itself and no judicial power.
Yet the Committee uncovers no
new information in these open
hearings, nor does it succeed in
forcing its witnesses to "confess"
to Communist activity. Thus, in
it« present form, the Committee's
