Editor, the Daily:
What a clever, precise lawyer
Professor Merryman must he,
and what a master of innuendo!
Personally I prefer Professor
Watkins' more direct, humane,
1 hough somewhat vague ap
proach.
But what strikes me most
about their letters is that Profes
sor Watkins is willing to write
about the serious problem of the
unnecessary and d e v a s t a 1 in g
sense of inadequacy that many
students suffer, and Professor
Merryman lo champion the need
for clear thinking.
It is a healthy sign that both
feel free to do this in the Daily,
and that Professor Merryman
openly locks horns with a col
league. though under the maca

bre guise of slashing an under
graduate.
It is high lime professors at
Stanford drop the hyprocrisy of
smiling agreement on matters of
general concern and of keeping
safely within the confines of their
specialties when problems of
general concern confront them.
But enough of generalities. The
blow Professor Merryman has
dealt demands a duel, and I gladly
offer myself as Professor Wat
kins' second. The weapons:
words. The scene: a forum. The
purpose: to enlist Professor Mer
ryman's talents to help Professor
Watkins solve the problem he has
raised.
