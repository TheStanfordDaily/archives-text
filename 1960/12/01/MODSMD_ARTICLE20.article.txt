At Last, Something to Cheer About
Now that Stanford has completed its disastrous football season
we can stop looking ahead wistfully for a win. With the inaugural
basketball game on schedule tonight Stanford sport, fans should
have a lot to cheer about and we can look for an improving and
winning ball club as the season progresses.
COACH HOWIE DALLMAR will field the tallest cage squad in
many years for the Tribe with four boys who top the 6-7 mark
and only two under six feet. So at last it looks like Stanford will be
able to outrebound many opponents.
Dallmar rates depth as the strongest point of this year's team,
and we can see that Rich Hosley, backed by Mike Ledgerwood at
center; Bub Bowling and John Fontius or Don Clemetson and his
brother Doug at the guard spots; and finally John Hendry, John
Windsor and Phil Kelley at forwards, are all strong players.

BESIDES DEPTH and the in
crease in height comes the added
advantage of increased -speed
which should aid any fast break
or defensive efforts. However,
the big problem facing the Stan
ford cagers this year is lack of
experience and a shooter to re
place the top scoring John Arril
laga of last year's team.
This year Stanford will pre
sent a balanced scoring attack
with no real big guns like Arril
laga or Paul Neumann of recent
Card teams. However, until Hos
ley and Clemetson or Fontius get
used to playing with veterans
Hendry, Bowling and Windsor
we may see Stanford scoring in
streaks and they may have trou
bles in the first few games.
But as the season wears on,
Hosley one of the most aggres
sive of latter-day Tribe centers—

should clear the hoards as well as set up many scoring plays from
his post position.
Certainly Bowling ranks with the past great Card guards in his
play-making and team generalship, and. with Windsor, should help
in Tribe scoring. So we should see a tall, scrapping and winning
team on tlie map this season.
HOWEVER, NOT ONLY have the Cards improved hut also has
ihe opposition this year. Tonight we will see one of the top national
basketball players in St. Mary's Tom Meschery. The tall Gael for
ward will be a top scorer and has been mentioned in some Ail-Amer
ican ratings.
In the Utah Utes, the Indians are facing one of the top five
basketball teams in the nation and that tower Bill McGill. Also ace
Ute guard Joe Morton helps sparkplug a team that went 2(5-3 includ
ing a win over NCAA champs Ohio State.
The Tribe gets two "breathers" in always tough Santa Clara and
the USF Dons. Then it's the Los Angeles Tourney and such tough
coast teams as SC, UCLA and Cal as well as good squads from the
Big Ten. The first game will be against one of the top pre-season
squads, Indiana. Hosley will have quite a job on his hands in corral
ing Olympic star Walt Bellamy—a mere 6-11 Hoosier. This team also
played better ball than the Ohio State Buckeyes in league play last
year, beating them soundly at home and losing by one point at
Columbus.
The Indians may also face Minnesota. Michigan State or lowa in
the Southland holiday tourney. Next Stanford has scheduled Ford
ham back at the Farm—and will see some fast, Eastern-style ball.
THEN THE LEAGUE opens with Cal and Washington picked as
Ihe top in the Big Five. The Bears—runner-ups in the NCAA final
last year have Bill McClintock, Bob Wendell and Earl Schultz re
luming. Thus they must be rated as odds-on favorites even with
their new coach Rene Herrarias.
Up in Washington. (5-S junior center Bill Hansen leads a young
but experienced Husky team. Hansen—rated by Dallmar as the best
center on the coast —gave the Indians a rough time last year and
is backed up by Lyle Bakken and Clinton Names at guards.
Oregon a non-conference foe—has the height in Glenn Moore
and Charlie Warren but must replace All-Coast Chuck Rask at guard.
If they find a sparkplug like Rask, the Ducks could once again end
up in the NCAA playoffs.
BOTH SOUTHERN TEAMS have many returning veterans with
UCLA looking to be the toughest of the Southland duo. The Bruins
will feature a speedy, rebounding club that shoots few shots, while
the Trojans have a younger but taller team this year.
Any ways you look at it.the Tribe will have to take each team
one at a time and tonight it's the Gaels. However, the cage future
looks rosy and maybe at last we do have something to cheer about
on the Farm.

brother Doug at the guard spots; and finally John Hendry, John
Windsor and Phil Kelley at forwards, are all strong players.

BESIDES DEPTH and the in
crease in height comes the added
advantage of increased -speed
which should aid any fast break
or defensive efforts. However,
the big problem facing the Stan
ford cagers this year is lack of
experience and a shooter to re
place the top scoring John Arril
laga of last year's team.
This year Stanford will pre
sent a balanced scoring attack
with no real big guns like Arril
laga or Paul Neumann of recent
Card teams. However, until Hos
ley and Clemetson or Fontius get
used to playing with veterans
Hendry, Bowling and Windsor
we may see Stanford scoring in
streaks and they may have trou
bles in the first few games.
But as the season wears on,
Hosley one of the most aggres
sive of latter-day Tribe centers—

should clear the hoards as well as set up many scoring plays from
his post position.
Certainly Bowling ranks with the past great Card guards in his
play-making and team generalship, and. with Windsor, should help
in Tribe scoring. So we should see a tall, scrapping and winning
team on tlie map this season.
HOWEVER, NOT ONLY have the Cards improved hut also has
ihe opposition this year. Tonight we will see one of the top national
basketball players in St. Mary's Tom Meschery. The tall Gael for
ward will be a top scorer and has been mentioned in some Ail-Amer
ican ratings.
In the Utah Utes, the Indians are facing one of the top five
basketball teams in the nation and that tower Bill McGill. Also ace
Ute guard Joe Morton helps sparkplug a team that went 2(5-3 includ
ing a win over NCAA champs Ohio State.
The Tribe gets two "breathers" in always tough Santa Clara and
the USF Dons. Then it's the Los Angeles Tourney and such tough
coast teams as SC, UCLA and Cal as well as good squads from the
Big Ten. The first game will be against one of the top pre-season
squads, Indiana. Hosley will have quite a job on his hands in corral
ing Olympic star Walt Bellamy—a mere 6-11 Hoosier. This team also
played better ball than the Ohio State Buckeyes in league play last
year, beating them soundly at home and losing by one point at
Columbus.
The Indians may also face Minnesota. Michigan State or lowa in
the Southland holiday tourney. Next Stanford has scheduled Ford
ham back at the Farm—and will see some fast, Eastern-style ball.
THEN THE LEAGUE opens with Cal and Washington picked as
Ihe top in the Big Five. The Bears—runner-ups in the NCAA final
last year have Bill McClintock, Bob Wendell and Earl Schultz re
luming. Thus they must be rated as odds-on favorites even with
their new coach Rene Herrarias.
Up in Washington. (5-S junior center Bill Hansen leads a young
but experienced Husky team. Hansen—rated by Dallmar as the best
center on the coast —gave the Indians a rough time last year and
is backed up by Lyle Bakken and Clinton Names at guards.
Oregon a non-conference foe—has the height in Glenn Moore
and Charlie Warren but must replace All-Coast Chuck Rask at guard.
If they find a sparkplug like Rask, the Ducks could once again end
up in the NCAA playoffs.
BOTH SOUTHERN TEAMS have many returning veterans with
UCLA looking to be the toughest of the Southland duo. The Bruins
will feature a speedy, rebounding club that shoots few shots, while
the Trojans have a younger but taller team this year.
Any ways you look at it.the Tribe will have to take each team
one at a time and tonight it's the Gaels. However, the cage future
looks rosy and maybe at last we do have something to cheer about
on the Farm.


COACH HOWIE DALLMAR
Has Height, Depth
At Last, Something to Cheer About
Now that Stanford has completed its disastrous football season
we can stop looking ahead wistfully for a win. With the inaugural
basketball game on schedule tonight Stanford sport, fans should
have a lot to cheer about and we can look for an improving and
winning ball club as the season progresses.
COACH HOWIE DALLMAR will field the tallest cage squad in
many years for the Tribe with four boys who top the 6-7 mark
and only two under six feet. So at last it looks like Stanford will be
able to outrebound many opponents.

Hendry, Bowling and Windsor
we may see Stanford scoring in
streaks and they may have trou
bles in the first few games.
But as the season wears on,
Hosley one of the most aggres
sive of latter-day Tribe centers—

should clear the hoards as well as set up many scoring plays from
his post position.
Certainly Bowling ranks with the past great Card guards in his
play-making and team generalship, and. with Windsor, should help
in Tribe scoring. So we should see a tall, scrapping and winning
team on tlie map this season.
HOWEVER, NOT ONLY have the Cards improved hut also has
ihe opposition this year. Tonight we will see one of the top national
basketball players in St. Mary's Tom Meschery. The tall Gael for
ward will be a top scorer and has been mentioned in some Ail-Amer
ican ratings.
In the Utah Utes, the Indians are facing one of the top five
basketball teams in the nation and that tower Bill McGill. Also ace
Ute guard Joe Morton helps sparkplug a team that went 2(5-3 includ
ing a win over NCAA champs Ohio State.
The Tribe gets two "breathers" in always tough Santa Clara and
the USF Dons. Then it's the Los Angeles Tourney and such tough
coast teams as SC, UCLA and Cal as well as good squads from the
Big Ten. The first game will be against one of the top pre-season
squads, Indiana. Hosley will have quite a job on his hands in corral
ing Olympic star Walt Bellamy—a mere 6-11 Hoosier. This team also
played better ball than the Ohio State Buckeyes in league play last
year, beating them soundly at home and losing by one point at
Columbus.
The Indians may also face Minnesota. Michigan State or lowa in
the Southland holiday tourney. Next Stanford has scheduled Ford
ham back at the Farm—and will see some fast, Eastern-style ball.
THEN THE LEAGUE opens with Cal and Washington picked as
Ihe top in the Big Five. The Bears—runner-ups in the NCAA final
last year have Bill McClintock, Bob Wendell and Earl Schultz re
luming. Thus they must be rated as odds-on favorites even with
their new coach Rene Herrarias.
Up in Washington. (5-S junior center Bill Hansen leads a young
but experienced Husky team. Hansen—rated by Dallmar as the best
center on the coast —gave the Indians a rough time last year and
is backed up by Lyle Bakken and Clinton Names at guards.
Oregon a non-conference foe—has the height in Glenn Moore
and Charlie Warren but must replace All-Coast Chuck Rask at guard.
If they find a sparkplug like Rask, the Ducks could once again end
up in the NCAA playoffs.
BOTH SOUTHERN TEAMS have many returning veterans with
UCLA looking to be the toughest of the Southland duo. The Bruins
will feature a speedy, rebounding club that shoots few shots, while
the Trojans have a younger but taller team this year.
Any ways you look at it.the Tribe will have to take each team
one at a time and tonight it's the Gaels. However, the cage future
looks rosy and maybe at last we do have something to cheer about
on the Farm.


COACH HOWIE DALLMAR
Has Height, Depth
At Last, Something to Cheer About
Now that Stanford has completed its disastrous football season
we can stop looking ahead wistfully for a win. With the inaugural
basketball game on schedule tonight Stanford sport, fans should
have a lot to cheer about and we can look for an improving and
winning ball club as the season progresses.
COACH HOWIE DALLMAR will field the tallest cage squad in
many years for the Tribe with four boys who top the 6-7 mark
and only two under six feet. So at last it looks like Stanford will be
able to outrebound many opponents.
Dallmar rates depth as the strongest point of this year's team,
and we can see that Rich Hosley, backed by Mike Ledgerwood at
center; Bub Bowling and John Fontius or Don Clemetson and his
brother Doug at the guard spots; and finally John Hendry, John
Windsor and Phil Kelley at forwards, are all strong players.

BESIDES DEPTH and the in
crease in height comes the added
advantage of increased -speed
which should aid any fast break
or defensive efforts. However,
the big problem facing the Stan
ford cagers this year is lack of
experience and a shooter to re
place the top scoring John Arril
laga of last year's team.
This year Stanford will pre
sent a balanced scoring attack
with no real big guns like Arril
laga or Paul Neumann of recent
Card teams. However, until Hos
ley and Clemetson or Fontius get
used to playing with veterans
Hendry, Bowling and Windsor
