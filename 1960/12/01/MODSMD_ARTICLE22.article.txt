# MESCHERY AT PAVILION
## Hoopsters Meet Gaels in Opener 
### KEN DERY 
The Stanford basketball team
in the Pavilion and chances are
great one.
Led by 6-6 Tom Meschery thi
Gaels and if the experts have pegj
will be a powerhouse.
COACII Howie Dallmar's young 1
but immensely eager quintet j
knows it has a tough opener, but
they have been practicing for
long weeks now and should thrive I
on the competition of a game that j
counts.
Scheduled to start for the Tribe '
are guards Bub Bowling and soph
omore Don Clemetson, Jo h n
Windsor and John Hendry at for
wards and Rich Hosley at the
center post.
Bowling and Hendry are sen-!
iors and the co-captains, Windsor
is a junior who showed a lot of j
promise last year and Clemetson 1
and Hosley are dribbling their
first roundball in a varsity game.
HOSLEY AT 6-7 is expected to j
give the farm strong board help
something that has been lacking
for years. Rich injured his neck i
two summers ago and was held
out last season to let it heal. He
is in fine fettle now and anxious
to get back to the battles on the
hardwood.
With Windsor also measuring
6-7 and Hendry a "big" 6-3, Mr. j
Meschery and company should
come to know the co/.iness of the
diminutive Pavilion before the
thing goes too far.
If the Gaels are to take the
game 6-9 center A 1 Clairborne
must play an important part. Phil
Hart and Gene Womack will pro
vide the backcourt fire and bal
anced help should come from 6-."5
sophomore Steve Gray, juniors l
Hamilton Homes <6-41, Barry!
Hayward and seniors Wes Tamm i
(6-5), Greg Johnston and Jack
Dold.
Last season's frosh team went |
17-1 and sends up three slick ball
handlers in Vurdell Newsome,
Tom Sheridan and Kit Ruona.
BUT STILL the boy to watch is
Meschery. Last year he severely
injured his jawbone in December
yet hung in there the remainder
of the season, although forced to
wear a grotesque mask similar to
a boxer's protective headguard.
Backing up for the home team
are John Fontius. a strong guard
who is expected to be a starter
when he fully recovers from an
illness, Phil Kelly, the fast handed
forward and center Mike Ledger
wood, 6-8.

Led by 6-6 Tom Meschery thi
Gaels and if the experts have pegj

COACII Howie Dallmar's young 1
but immensely eager quintet j
knows it has a tough opener, but
they have been practicing for
long weeks now and should thrive I
on the competition of a game that j
counts.
Scheduled to start for the Tribe '
are guards Bub Bowling and soph
omore Don Clemetson, Jo h n
Windsor and John Hendry at for
wards and Rich Hosley at the
center post.
Bowling and Hendry are sen-!
iors and the co-captains, Windsor
is a junior who showed a lot of j
promise last year and Clemetson 1
and Hosley are dribbling their
first roundball in a varsity game.
HOSLEY AT 6-7 is expected to j
give the farm strong board help
something that has been lacking
for years. Rich injured his neck i
two summers ago and was held
out last season to let it heal. He
is in fine fettle now and anxious
to get back to the battles on the
hardwood.
With Windsor also measuring
6-7 and Hendry a "big" 6-3, Mr. j
Meschery and company should
come to know the co/.iness of the
diminutive Pavilion before the
thing goes too far.
If the Gaels are to take the
game 6-9 center A 1 Clairborne
must play an important part. Phil
Hart and Gene Womack will pro
vide the backcourt fire and bal
anced help should come from 6-."5
sophomore Steve Gray, juniors l
Hamilton Homes <6-41, Barry!
Hayward and seniors Wes Tamm i
(6-5), Greg Johnston and Jack
Dold.
Last season's frosh team went |
17-1 and sends up three slick ball
handlers in Vurdell Newsome,
Tom Sheridan and Kit Ruona.
BUT STILL the boy to watch is
Meschery. Last year he severely
injured his jawbone in December
yet hung in there the remainder
of the season, although forced to
wear a grotesque mask similar to
a boxer's protective headguard.
Backing up for the home team
are John Fontius. a strong guard
who is expected to be a starter
when he fully recovers from an
illness, Phil Kelly, the fast handed
forward and center Mike Ledger
