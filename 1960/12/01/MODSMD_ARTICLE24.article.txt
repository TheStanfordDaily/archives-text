# Freshman Hoop Squad Plays Gaels
## 
### 
THE 1960 version of Ihe Stan
ford Freshman basketball team
will be unveiled tonight as the
Bill Turner coached Papooses face
St. Mary's Gaels.
Heading the lineup are two for
mer Los Angeles prepsters. At ,
center will be Tom Dose, a (>-T 1 |
performer from Glendale High
School. Last year Dose was the
All-CIF player of the year. He
has a fine hook shot, mixing his
shooting ability with quick moves
to befuddle the opposition.
Mollis Moore is the other south
lander in the starting lineup.
Moore's 6-3 1 height helps him to j
be a good rebounder and shot. Ho
was second string All-Los Ange
les last year.
The other forward is Rich
Gritschke, an all-leaguer from I
Illinois. He is also 6-3'ij and a j
good rebounder.
Handling the guard positions'
are Lew Shupe and John Ken-1
nedy.
SHUPE is only 5-9, but his!
quick moves help him to stay with
taller opponents. Kennedy, 6-0, is
from Pacifica High School in San
Luis Obispo.
Backing up the first string are
Bob Hoi 1 man, Bob Ewing and
Bernie Butcher.
Leading the St. Mary's attack
are three Southern Californians.
Bill Connolly, an all CIF guard
from Long Beach, Steve Miller,
the All-CIF small school player
of the year, and Dennis Tons from
Mt. Carmel of Los Angeles figure
to make the Gaels a team to be
reckoned with.
The Papooses should fare
pretty well with a little bit of
everything in their offensive grab
bag: Height, slick ball handling
and shooting ability.
