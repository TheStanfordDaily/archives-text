LOUISVILLE, Ky. (UPl)â€”'The
Pacific Coast League decided to
carry organized baseball to the
Mid-Pacific by placing a fran
chise in Honolulu.
League President Dewy Sori
ano said, "The Pacific Coast
League will operate in the City of
Honolulu in 1961. There are sev
eral arrangements that have to
be straightened out, such as park
lease and transportation:"
He said, "There are three other
groups, whom I cannot identify
at this time, who are very inter
ested, and we know that one of
them is ready to buy the Sacra

mento club for $55,000 and move
it to Honolulu."
There were indications that at
least part of this group included
Honolulu interests. Ralph Kincr,
president of the San Diego Pa
dres, said the P.C.L. officials
would prefer that the Honolulu
franchise be operated by people
from Hawaii.
Soriano said he will meet Fri
day in San Francisco with Chinn
Ho, Honolulu civic leader who
heads the Honolulu Stadium Cor
poration, to complete negotiations
for use of the 22,000-seat ball
park.
