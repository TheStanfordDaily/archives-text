The time has come to make nut our Christmas shopping lists,
for Christmas will ho upon us quicker than you 0:111 say Jack
Robinson. (Have you evor wondered, incidentally, about the
origin of this interesting phrase "Quicker than you can say
Jack Kobinson"? Well sir, the original phrase was French —
"Phis ril<■ que (lc dire Jacques Robespierre." Jack Robinson is,
as everyone knows, an anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who
was, as everyone knows, the famous figure from the French
Revolution who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath
by Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Aaron Burr.
(The reason people started saying "Quicker than you can say
Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is called in English
speaking countries)" is quite an interesting little story. 11 seems
that Robespierre's wife, Ceorges Sand, got word of tho plot to
murder her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his
life was call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than
she could say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from
her old friend Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca setting
lyrics to his immortal "Warsaw Concerto." Chopin said he
needed Georges Sand's help desperately because he could not
find a rhyme for "Warsaw." Naturally, Georges Sand could not
refuse such an urgent request.
(Well sir, Georges Sand went traipsing off to Majorca, but
before she left she told her little daughter Walter that some bad
men were coming to murder daddy in his bath, and she in
structed Walter to shout Robespierre's name when the bad men
arrived. But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning
on the Riviera, and she had come home loaded with sea shells
and salt water taffy, and when the bad men came to murder
Robespierre, Walter, alas, was chewing a big wad of salt water
taffy and could not got her mouth open in time to shout a
warning. Robespierre, alas, was murdered quicker than you
could shout Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as lie is
called in the English-speaking countries).
(There is, 1 am pleased to report, one small note of cheer in
this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca where
Chopin was setting lyrics to his immortal "Warsaw Concerto,"
she was happily able to help him find a rhyme for "Warsaw,"
as everyone knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:
In tlx fair town of Warsaw,
Which Xapolcon's horse saw,
Singing cockles and mussels, alive alive 0!)

Wo worn speaking of Christmas gifts. AYhat we all strive to fin
at Christmas is, of course, to find unusual, offbeat, different
gifts for our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro
Cigarettes?
What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros
as unusual, offbeat, different? You had regarded them as familiar,
reliable smokes whose excellence varied not one jot or tittle
from year to year?
True. All true. Hut at the same time, Marlboros areuniMial,
offbeat, different, because every time you try one, it'< like the
first time. The flavor never palls, never gets hackneyed. Kach
Marlboro is a fresh delight, a pristine pleasure, and if you want
all your friends to clap their hands and exclaim, "Yes, \ irginia,
there if a Santa Clans!'' you will put them at the very top of

The time has come to make nut our Christmas shopping lists,
for Christmas will ho upon us quicker than you 0:111 say Jack
Robinson. (Have you evor wondered, incidentally, about the
origin of this interesting phrase "Quicker than you can say
Jack Kobinson"? Well sir, the original phrase was French —
"Phis ril<■ que (lc dire Jacques Robespierre." Jack Robinson is,
as everyone knows, an anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who
was, as everyone knows, the famous figure from the French
Revolution who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath
by Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Aaron Burr.
(The reason people started saying "Quicker than you can say
Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is called in English
speaking countries)" is quite an interesting little story. 11 seems
that Robespierre's wife, Ceorges Sand, got word of tho plot to
murder her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his
life was call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than
she could say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from
her old friend Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca setting
lyrics to his immortal "Warsaw Concerto." Chopin said he
needed Georges Sand's help desperately because he could not
find a rhyme for "Warsaw." Naturally, Georges Sand could not
refuse such an urgent request.
(Well sir, Georges Sand went traipsing off to Majorca, but
before she left she told her little daughter Walter that some bad
men were coming to murder daddy in his bath, and she in
structed Walter to shout Robespierre's name when the bad men
arrived. But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning
on the Riviera, and she had come home loaded with sea shells
and salt water taffy, and when the bad men came to murder
Robespierre, Walter, alas, was chewing a big wad of salt water
taffy and could not got her mouth open in time to shout a
warning. Robespierre, alas, was murdered quicker than you
could shout Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as lie is
called in the English-speaking countries).
(There is, 1 am pleased to report, one small note of cheer in
this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca where
Chopin was setting lyrics to his immortal "Warsaw Concerto,"
she was happily able to help him find a rhyme for "Warsaw,"
