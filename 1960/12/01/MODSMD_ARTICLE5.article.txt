# Court Knocks Props From Louisiana Segregation Law
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (UPI> A federal court knocked the props from under (he state's segregation
fight yesterday, hut shrieking housewives menaced a minister and a meter reader's wife who won't
take their white daughters out of an integrated school.
A three-judge federal court struck away one of ihe last legal hopes of segregationists shortly after
two elementary, schools opened on an integrated basis for the.eighth day.
It ruled unconstitutional the theory of interposition which means a state need not necessarily

obey the Supreme Court and
threw out 17 state segregation
laws and five resolutions. It also
denied a school board motion to
end integration and enjoined
practically every official in Loui
siana from interfering with in
tegration.
THE irate state legislature con
sidered bills that would provide
grants-in-aid for parents who
want to send their children to pri
vate schools. However, the bills
would continue the public school
system, too.
The state House of Representa
tives passed unanimously a reso
lution denouncing the federal
court and proclaiming interposi
tion "the supreme law of the
land."
The court ruling came as no
surprise to state legislators, who
met again in special session last
night. They indicated they would
ignore the rulings. Attorney Gen
eral Jack Gremillion said he
would appeal, and Gov. Jimmie
Davis, leader of the fight against
integration, had no comment.
The three-judge panel, which
included District Judge J. Skelly
Wright, the man who ordered in
tegration, said that it "is clear 1
that interposition is not a Consti
tutional doctrine. Taken seriously,
it is illegal defiance -of Constitu
tional authority."
OTHERWISE, said the opinion
in a sarcastic reference to the
fuming Louisiana Legislature, "it
amounts to no more than a pro
test. an escape valve through
which the legislatures blow off
steam to relieve their tensions."
School Board President Lloyd
Rittiner said that the Legislature
should now realize that the
"courts will not settle for any
thing less than integration."
Rittiner said he did not know
until recently of a 38-year-old Lou
isiana law prohibiting the opera
tion of a public school for less
than 10 pupils without permission
from the board of education.
"If we invoked that," Rittiner
said, "there's reason to believe
the court might just older us to
integrate two new schools."
Rittiner said he thought the
boycott would break today.
Rep. Bill Crais, author of the
Louisiana Legislature's bills, said
the state would still provide funds
for public schools, and it would
be up to parents whether they
wanted their children in public,
integrated schools or private,
segregated schools.
The legislation was sent to com
mittee and cannot be passed for
several days unless rules are sus
pended Rep. Risley Triche, Gov.
Jimmie Davis' floor leader, said
that "we refuse to have the State
of Louisiana summarily dissolved
by a federal court,"

Rittiner said he did not know
until recently of a 38-year-old Lou
isiana law prohibiting the opera
tion of a public school for less
than 10 pupils without permission
from the board of education.

said, "there's reason to believe

Rittiner said he thought the

Rep. Bill Crais, author of the
Louisiana Legislature's bills, said
the state would still provide funds
for public schools, and it would
be up to parents whether they
wanted their children in public,
integrated schools or private,
segregated schools.

NEW ORLEANS (UPI> A federal court knocked the props from under (he state's segregation
fight yesterday, hut shrieking housewives menaced a minister and a meter reader's wife who won't
take their white daughters out of an integrated school.
A three-judge federal court struck away one of ihe last legal hopes of segregationists shortly after
two elementary, schools opened on an integrated basis for the.eighth day.
It ruled unconstitutional the theory of interposition which means a state need not necessarily

obey the Supreme Court and
threw out 17 state segregation
laws and five resolutions. It also
denied a school board motion to
end integration and enjoined
practically every official in Loui
siana from interfering with in
tegration.
THE irate state legislature con
sidered bills that would provide
grants-in-aid for parents who
want to send their children to pri
vate schools. However, the bills
would continue the public school
system, too.
The state House of Representa
tives passed unanimously a reso
lution denouncing the federal
court and proclaiming interposi
tion "the supreme law of the
land."
The court ruling came as no
surprise to state legislators, who
met again in special session last
night. They indicated they would
ignore the rulings. Attorney Gen
eral Jack Gremillion said he
would appeal, and Gov. Jimmie
Davis, leader of the fight against
integration, had no comment.
The three-judge panel, which
included District Judge J. Skelly
Wright, the man who ordered in
tegration, said that it "is clear 1
that interposition is not a Consti
tutional doctrine. Taken seriously,
it is illegal defiance -of Constitu
tional authority."
OTHERWISE, said the opinion
in a sarcastic reference to the
fuming Louisiana Legislature, "it
amounts to no more than a pro
test. an escape valve through
which the legislatures blow off
steam to relieve their tensions."
