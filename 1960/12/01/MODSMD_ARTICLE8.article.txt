# Closer Student-Faculty Relations Fostered
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ 
Informal gatherings at the homes of West
ern Civ instructors and open houses hosted
by professors in various departments fol
lowing Tuesday Evening Series' talks are
on the student-faculty relations agenda for
next quarter.
As a start toward the goal of a stronger
faculty-student coalition, letters have been
sent lo each Civ instructor urging his par
ticipation in the informal program. Follow
ing the initiative of the Engineering Depart
ment, which was the first to organize the
program, a fund is available to the Civ De
partment for the express purpose of enter
taining students. Available through Dean
H. Donald Winbigler's office, the fund is
open to jill department members for use at
their discretion. Recently a letter was sent
to each adviser, a total of approximately
500. suggesting informal gatherings of ad
visers and advisees, another program which
can be enacted through an existing Univer
sity fund for the purpose.
TAKKN INTO account has been the full
schedule of the average adviser. Should an
adviser wish to entertain a group of his ad
visees. yet lack the time or knowledge of fa
cilities to organize the event, the services of
the student-faculty commission are available
to him. A commission member would ar
range for a gathering place and the procure
ment of refreshments. A list of facilities for
obtaining refreshments is being compiled for
A recent, small scale, student poll indi

cated favorable response to faculty-led dis
cussion groups following controversial cam
pus or TV presentations. The groups to be
held next quarter will provide students with
the ability to pursue questions stimulated
by visiting speakers, with the advantage of
the experience and interest of a faculty mem
ber. A specific example lies in tentative plans
for a group after the address by Dr. James Pi.
Conant scheduled for next quarter.
Two of the prime programs in the field
of student-faculty relations faculty resi
dents and faculty associates see a future
t ha I is not quite so definite. In terms of
housing, two undergraduate clusters are
being planned with one faculty resident in
each. At this point the University has not
decided whether to go ahead with a third
cluster, or wait for experience with the first
two. At the moment, according to Provost of
the University Frederick Torman, things are
a bit confused as to what shall be done in
the future. An estimate of the cost of the
undergraduate resident program is being
formulated. As the program stands pres
ently. it is not sharply defined enough to be
clearly evaluated.
Till; FACULTY associate program has
met with a great deal of interest among sev
eral faculty members and, according to Tor
man. the program is "going quite well. I
imagine it will accomplish some very good
I hings."
While the associate program began in the
women's residences, and spread to the men's
dorms, it was met vitli a certain degree of

1 indifference by the fraternities. Fraternity
resident and associate programs will meet
their first true test with the fraternity
j cluster.
i Dr. Torman. acting in the capacity of Pres
ident Sterling during his absence, was ques
! tioned on his evaluation of the Stern faculty
resident program: "It is hard to evalualo. It
; is a good thing, yet there has been some dif
ficulty in the two houses served that did
not arise in the others. This, of course, could
bo coincidental."
"The University is now beginning to place
housing more in the academic field, and re
garding it less as a hotel project. We feel
the academic people should be more aggres
-1 sive and have more voice in housing policies.
We are beginning to move into this field, but
we are still in the stage of tackling the
problem, rather than suggesting specific
plans for enlargement or change of present
policies. There is an increasing realization
that housing ranks as an academic problem."
STANFORD UNIVKRSITY stands on the
brink of achieving a full program of student
faculty relations. We presently have several
programs completing an early stage of evo
lution, and through projects of the student
faculty commission, will see the initiation of
several more.
The ultimate goal is a spontaneous inter-
I mingling of students and faculty; to achieve
this idealistic concept we concentrate on live
individual progVams in hopes their growth
and enlargement will come as a matter of
