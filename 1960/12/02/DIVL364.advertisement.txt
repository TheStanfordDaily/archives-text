Harmonic shakedown for cars
The "vehicle stroker," pictured above, helps General Motors engineers investigate
harmonic vibration, roll rates and dynamic ride properties of an instrumented
car. Through electronics, researchers are able to measure accurately the resonant
frequencies of a car's major components, and actually plot elastic deflection
, curves and phase relationships to improve car structure.
To the young mind willing to tackle the problems of modern technology,
General Motors offers unlimited opportunity in a vast number of scien
tific and engineering fields — automotive research, production engineer
ing and manufacturing, electronics and astronautics, to name a few.
GM's many and varied divisions throughout the country present employ
ment opportunities a thousandfold. Talent is recognized and rewarded,
and your own ability is the only restriction on your rate of progress. In
addition, GM's experience and diversification create a favorable climate
for your growth.
GM also offers financial aid for postgraduate and undergraduate
studies. For more information see your college Placement Officer, or
write to General Motors Salaried Personnel Staff, Detroit 2, Michigan.
