# Integrated Cheering Put on Spring Ballot
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Integration—Stanford style—will be resolved next spring as a
result of last night's LASSU action placing the question of a mixed
rooting section on the campus spring election ballot.
LASSU, meeting around a glowing fireside at Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler's home, approved a motion introduced by Lag-

unita Representative Joy Howard
calling for the students to decide
! "shall the Stanford Rooting Sec
tion be integrated for all football
games?"
THE MOTION, passed 12-6 (all
women for, six men against),
also declares that if the measure
is approved "integration shall be
come effective at the beginning
of the 1961 football season."
Legislature also heard a report
I from Toyon Rep Bill June, report
ing for the Academic Affairs
Committee, on academic pressure
on students. While noting that
the first report was only prelimi
nary and much work still remains
to be done on the subject, June
did reveal that he had encoun-
tered feeling that there is too
much academic pressure on stu-
dents.
HE SAID some people talked to
complained of over-emphasis
placed on rote learning and not
enough attention paid to intel
lectual development.
Some sponsors, faculty mem
bers and students said there is
"absolutely too much pressure,"
June said, but he also pointed out
that some of those questioned felt
that pressure is desirable.
June told Legislature that more
intensive investigation of the mat
ter will continue next quarter.
