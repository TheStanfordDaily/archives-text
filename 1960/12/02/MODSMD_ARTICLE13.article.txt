## Six Students Slip by White Barricade 
### 
j NEW ORLEANS ( UPI) -
I White housewives became so furi-
I ous yesterday when six white
children were slipped past their
blockade into an integrated school
that they began chasing by
standers.
They cursed, shoved, pum
meled and kicked nearly a dozen
assorted bystanders, including
newsmen and elderly women,
after white parent s out maneu
vered them and boosted Ihe at
tendance at William Frantz
School to sevenâ€”six white stu
dents and a Negro girl.
IT WAS the highest attendance
j at Frantz in the last six days of
integration. But at McDonogh 19.
three Negro girls were still alone
in the building the 467 white
students at the school boycotted
it for the fifth day.
The "cheerleaders," as police
call the core of about 40 of the
housewife heckling team that ap
pears daily at Frantz School,
braved bitter cold temperatures
today but were frustrated from
their prime objective.
The Rev. Andrew Foreman and
Mrs. Daisy Gabrille, arriving
about half an hour apart, got
their daughters into the school
by a side door opposite to the side
where the "cheerleaders" were
waiting. The Rev. Foreman also
brought two little boys with him,
believed to be the sons of a Bap
tist divinity student.
ALSO A FEW of the women
were able to get around the build
ing in time to heckle the parents.
At that moment, Lanny Gold
finch, a white graduate student
at Tulane University who has re
ceived widespread publicity for
getting arrested for criminal
anarchy when he took part in a
Negro sit-in demonstration, drove
up to the school with three Ne
groes in the car with him.
THE CROWD surged toward
Goldfinch as he got out of the
car. Police got there first, though,
and trotted Goldfinch back to his
car. with the crowd shoving and
punching at him as they went.
They beat on the roof of the car
as he drove off.
Then "the cheerleaders" discov
ered that George Dreyfous, presi
dent of the Louisiana Civil Lib
erties League, and three elderly
women from the "Save Our
School" group weie standing
among them observing.
With loud cries of "Commu
nists" and "Nigger Lover" the
crowd started chasing the observ
ers. Dreyfous, an elderly man,
hustled briskly to his car with
police trying to clear a path for
him.
The "cheerleaders" spat at him
without hitting him and
shoved at him.
