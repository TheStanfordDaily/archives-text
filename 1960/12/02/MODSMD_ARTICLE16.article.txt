# KABL to Rescue
## 
### 
"The best way is to be sure
everyone in your house has a
Sequoia; that way, no one will
be balking up a stump." "Are
you SURE you want a Sequoia?"
"If Palo Alto means 'Tall Tree,'
what does Sequoia mean?"
For two weeks, listeners to
radio station KABL had been
teased into wondering just what
"Sequoia" does mean. They found
out two weeks ago when the an
nouncer instructed them not to
subscribe to Sequoia, Stanford
University's Literary Magazine.
Not, that is, unless they sought
intellectual stimulation, provoca
tive writing by the leading think
ers of our time and the great
authors of the future.
The "KABL Campaign" marks
an important moment in the his
tory of Stanford's literary mag
azine. If all goes well, and Busi
ness Manager Phil Nelson was
smiling at week's end, Sequoia
will become a self-supporting stu
dent publication. Until now it has
been kept alive by gifts. Univer
sity subsidy, LASSU appropria
tions, Publications Board money,
and its own meager advertising
and sales revenue.
But at the beginning of Fall
Quarter, when this year's staff
found itself faced with last year's
unpaid press bills, the sources
seemed suddenly dry. If KABL
can bring in enough new subscrip
tions, Sequoia hopes to break its
old dependence on outside funds.
The optimism is based on a
Publication Board committee re
port by Chaparral Business Man
ager Charles Landis and LASSU
representative Charles Lofgren.
The report analyzed Sequoia's
economic situation and potential,
and found in increased circula
tion an answer to the magazine's
woes.

Unlike other Stanford student
publications, it. said, Sequoia
could not look to advertising for
its operating capital. Increasing
the amount of advertising would
probably debase its aesthetic
qualities. With Publications
Board low on money and facing a
Daily loss for last year, with Leg
islature reluctant to underwrite
an unsuccessful venlure, and
witli sporadic and undependable
gifts, the report concluded that
circulation was the only out.
"The small publisher," Landis
later told Legislature, "is faced
with the dilemma of having to
sell bis magazine for less than it
costs him. But the fixed cost,
! such as typesetting and plate
making, are higher than the vari
ble costs for paper and press time,
so there is a break-even point. If
he can't sell enough advertising,
as does the Chaparral, then he
has to print and sell enough mag
azines. For Sequoia, it will take
' around 3,000."
Sequoia's sales, however, have
been steadily under 1,000. The
extra sales, it seemed, would have
to come from off-campus.
KABL, which takes pride in its
public-service, was willing to try
for Sequoia. Manager Homer
Odom offered everything the sta
tion could do and hoped it would
be enough. The result was a two
week "teaser campaign" during
which the listener's curiosity was
to be greatly aroused.
The "teaser campaign" ended
two weeks ago and is now being
followed with straight spot an
nouncements for Sequoia sub
scriptions. Odom declined to esti
mate ihe response, but noted that
two short plugs for a free elec
tion booklet had brought in 7,000
requests.
