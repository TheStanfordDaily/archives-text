Editor, the Daily:
As to Professor Merryman's
qualifications to comment on
Daily articles, anything we could
say would be invidious besides
being irrelevant to the real issue.
Rather, therefore, we direct our
inquiry to the validity of his ob
jections to the article appearing
in the Daily writen by another
Stanford professor.
The question in dispute is as we
interpret it: to what extent should
Stanford University be concerned
with the personal problems of Ihe
student who is unable to compete
scholastieally?
We think it a defensible thesis
that insofar as most students who
enter Stanford have had little ex
posure to serious scholarship,
some shock is to be expected upon
the first encounter. To minimize
the importance of the shock is to

minimize the importance of the
scholarship. Consequently, the
greater the shock the greater the
indication lhat the University is
doing an effective job.
Not everyone is capable for one
reason or another of meeting Ihe
established standards of any
good institution, otherwise the
appeal would be necessarily to
the lowest common level of com
presension.
The freshman who has spent
his childhood under mother's pro
tection, having been exposed only
to the literature and ideas that
parents, committees for decent
literature and what first grade
teachers think proper no doubt
will have a hard lime measuring
up at first.
