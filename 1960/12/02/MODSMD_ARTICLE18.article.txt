I do not; wish to quarrel with

; men can disagree about these
; complex matters. Having talked
with him many times, however,
I cannot believe we are at odds
on the essential goals of African
nationalism --- self government,
j equality of opportunity and an
end to degrading color bars.
The differences which seem to
i divide us are not about ends but
j means, the question of time and
I the role of minorities in newly in
i dependent African states. There
fore I will assume that Mr. Maina
misunderstood my remarks and is
not attempting to attribute to
me views I do not hold.
For example. I did not use the
words "local and irresponsible
leadership" hence I could not
(and would not) have so classi
fied Chief Luthuli for whom I
have the greatest respect.
Mr. Maina erroneously assumes
from my arguments that because
revolt in South Africa (for the
| present) is impossible that I am
j happy about this situation. I am
| not. Nor did I mean to infer that
Africans would never come to
power in South Africa.
I do not know why United
States' support of Liberia was
brought up since both Nkrumah
and Toure also support Mr. Tub
man; in fact they are trying to
work out a closer union with
Liberia.

what Maina says about Missis

i have made the point several limes

Africa have had a better record i

1 need only cite the compara
tive figures for lynchings in Ihej
United States between 1900-1956 j
there were 1,795 Negro lynchings,
during the same period in Rho-!
desia there were none. Moreover,;
as Dr. Kiano honestly admitted in
his talk Saturday evening in San

gone further and faster to end j
d e basing racial discrimination !

It is to be doubted that Euro
peans are solely at fault because I
Africans are not ready for inde
i pendence. I suggest that the pov

J of its people had something to do

The fact that European nations

I views John Chamberlain's Wall!

■
There is at Harvard no such of- i
I fice as "student body president." j
The only office which might be so :
j construed is "student council!
| president"; however, it is a well- ;
! known fact of Harvard politics i
j that less lhan 50 per cent of the |
• college (only undergraduates may |
| vote) cast ballots in the student
' council elections.
Furthermore, the council's
raison d'etre is only to represent
j the students in relations with the
j faculty. The council has neither
; Ihe authority nor the practice of
j representing the student, body in
external organizations (for ex
| ample, Harvard participation in
i the National Student Association
; has long been nominal or non
; existent, although a council rep
resentative attends meetings rep
j resenting the Harvard student
council).
It is impossible to consider any j
j single viewpoint as "typical" of j
; Harvard. However, a trend is
i worth mentioning. Traditionally I
| (as at Stanford), the students of!
! Harvard College are conservative,
and the faculty is liberal. This ;
j dichotomy has been less marked ;
j recently than in the past (say j
twenty years ago) due to the;
progressive liberalization of the |
student body. If a trend exists, I

it is the opposite of that adduced
by Chamberlain.
If this is the stuff of which
the Chamberlain and Hermann

tified in placing as little stock in

"Operation Abolition," an edi
torial written by the Daily Editor
and Disparager to prove lhat the
House Un-American Activities
Committee propaganda film cur
rently showing is not factual, was
simply marvelous.
After reading the editorial
there is simply no doubt about it
the film is hog-wash.
Every loyal Stanfordite shoidd
stand up and give a cheer for
the DEAD which protects us from
the insidious conspiracy of the
HUAC.
It is quite obvious after viewing
the editorial that ihe HUAC is a
sinister group dedicated to under
mining our liberal, progressive
way of life. They undoubtedly
bear unwarranted hatered and
malice toward that patriotic, pro
tective body, the DEAD.
Of course, the editorial was a
lill le biased; as a mater of fact,
it did not contain one iota of ob
jectivity, but then Ihe HUAC was
not; very objective either. You
would have to call the editorial
a propaganda vehicle rather than
an opinion on current affairs.
But then, we should ignore this
one fallacy since the editorial
does prove, even without resort
ing to facts, that the film was
produced by a subversive group
intent on warping the minds of
Young America. Actually, the
DEAD probably considers the
use of facts a little passe since
the subjective evidence is over
whelming.
The writer cf this letter has
seen Ihe film and contracted an

impression different from lhat of
the DEAD. But it is quile likely
that readers can at first analyze
the film objectively, but then fall
prey to the malicious ideology of
the HUAC.
1 hope that everyone has read
the editorials in the Daily so they
can discover just how the HUAC
can seize a patriotic incident such
as the democratic demonstrations
in San Francisco last spring, and
distort it into a cankerous horror
by leading people io believe it was
Communist inspired.

SAN FRANCISCO TO MOS
COW ON FOOT: Why? The des

The group is preparing hand
bills in six languages and Ihey
will interview political and relig

they enter. And in each country,
they plan a one hour demonstra
tion at every military installation
they pass.
On Saturday afternoon, Decem

rejection of military preparation

It is quite obvious after viewing

But then, we should ignore this

"Operation Abolition," an edi
torial written by the Daily Editor
and Disparager to prove lhat the
House Un-American Activities
Committee propaganda film cur
rently showing is not factual, was
simply marvelous.
After reading the editorial
there is simply no doubt about it
the film is hog-wash.
Every loyal Stanfordite shoidd
stand up and give a cheer for
the DEAD which protects us from
the insidious conspiracy of the
HUAC.
It is quite obvious after viewing
the editorial that ihe HUAC is a
sinister group dedicated to under
mining our liberal, progressive
way of life. They undoubtedly
bear unwarranted hatered and
malice toward that patriotic, pro
tective body, the DEAD.
Of course, the editorial was a
lill le biased; as a mater of fact,
it did not contain one iota of ob
jectivity, but then Ihe HUAC was
not; very objective either. You
would have to call the editorial
a propaganda vehicle rather than
an opinion on current affairs.
But then, we should ignore this
one fallacy since the editorial
does prove, even without resort
ing to facts, that the film was
produced by a subversive group
intent on warping the minds of
Young America. Actually, the
DEAD probably considers the
use of facts a little passe since
the subjective evidence is over
whelming.
The writer cf this letter has
seen Ihe film and contracted an

impression different from lhat of
the DEAD. But it is quile likely
that readers can at first analyze
the film objectively, but then fall
prey to the malicious ideology of
the HUAC.
1 hope that everyone has read
the editorials in the Daily so they
can discover just how the HUAC
can seize a patriotic incident such
as the democratic demonstrations
in San Francisco last spring, and
distort it into a cankerous horror
by leading people io believe it was
Communist inspired.

The group is preparing hand

On Saturday afternoon, Decem

I do not; wish to quarrel with
1 Mr. Maina. Obviously, fair-minded
; men can disagree about these
; complex matters. Having talked
with him many times, however,
I cannot believe we are at odds
on the essential goals of African
nationalism --- self government,
j equality of opportunity and an
end to degrading color bars.
The differences which seem to
i divide us are not about ends but
j means, the question of time and
I the role of minorities in newly in
i dependent African states. There
fore I will assume that Mr. Maina
misunderstood my remarks and is
not attempting to attribute to
me views I do not hold.
For example. I did not use the
words "local and irresponsible
leadership" hence I could not
(and would not) have so classi
fied Chief Luthuli for whom I
have the greatest respect.
Mr. Maina erroneously assumes
from my arguments that because
revolt in South Africa (for the
| present) is impossible that I am
j happy about this situation. I am
| not. Nor did I mean to infer that
Africans would never come to
power in South Africa.
I do not know why United
States' support of Liberia was
brought up since both Nkrumah
and Toure also support Mr. Tub
man; in fact they are trying to
work out a closer union with
Liberia.
j I wholeheartedly agree with
what Maina says about Missis
sippi. And he knows it, since I
i have made the point several limes
to him that British settlers in

Africa have had a better record i
in race relations than we have had
in the United States.
1 need only cite the compara
tive figures for lynchings in Ihej
United States between 1900-1956 j
there were 1,795 Negro lynchings,
during the same period in Rho-!
desia there were none. Moreover,;
as Dr. Kiano honestly admitted in
his talk Saturday evening in San
Francisco, Kenya whites have
gone further and faster to end j
d e basing racial discrimination !
than we have in the American |
South.
It is to be doubted that Euro
peans are solely at fault because I
Africans are not ready for inde
i pendence. I suggest that the pov
erty of Africa, the backwardness
J of its people had something to do
! with it.
The fact that European nations
after they had pacificed the con
tinent then fought two world
wars and suffered through a
severe depression should not be
ignored either. But no matter, we
are agreed; it is high time that
Africans were given a chance to,
rule Ihemselves.
