# Storm Causes Power Failures
## 
### 
Strong winds whipped into the
Bay Area yesterday bringing the
heaviest and most damaging
storm of the season. The 60 m.p.h.
gusts uprooted trees and downed
power lines, leaving thousands of
Peninsula homes and businesses
without electricity.
The Farm came in for its share
of power failure. The electricity
went out for approximately an
hour yesterday morning in Bran
ner, Wilbur. Toyon, and other
scattered areas throughout the
campus.
According to Guilford Lovelace,
Foreman of the Electric Shop, the
failure occurred when two 4,000-
volt wires were whipped together
by the wind causing a number of
fuses to blow out.
The storm damage was wide
spread throughout the Bay Area.
Winds reached 70 m.p.h. at the
San Carlos Airport where seven
private planes were demolished.
In Palo Alto a dredge was set
loose in the yacht harbor where
it rammed at least a dozen small
craft.
Yesterday was also the wettest
day of the season to date.
