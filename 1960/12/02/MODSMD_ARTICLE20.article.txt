# The 						Two Berlins: A Comparison
## 
### BOB HAMRDLA IIR Political Analyst 
It is inevitable that any report
on modern Berlin must differen
tiate between the two sectors of
the city, one under Allied control
and the other under that of the
"German Democratic Republic."
"West Berlin reminds one a
great deal of any other postwar
city in West Germany. Ruins and
vacant lots left by World War II
destruction are somewhat more
in evidence, however, because re
construction in West Berlin was
not begun in earnest until 1930 be
cause of the blockade.
A new city center has grown
(the old center is now part of
East Berlin», and there are de
partment stores, restaurants, and
office buildings as in any Amer
ican city.
The Kurfurstendumm, which is
Ihe entertainment street of West
Berlin, boasts of many fine res
taurants, cafes, and theaters. At

[ any time of day, the West Ber
liner who wants to see and he
seen will he found walking' on
some part of the 2-mile long Kur
fnrstendamm.
The 2,200,000 citizens of West
Berlin are very energetic and
very friendly, anxious to live a
normal life, culturally and so
cially, in spite of the isolation of
their city.
The Oprea House is rebuilt and
offers a full program of high
quality performances. There are
theaters which offer the latest in
stage plays. Not to be neglected
are the "political satire" cafes,
where world politics are lam
pooned before packed houses.
East Berlin is also culturally
minded regarding- good operas
and plays, but one notices that
their culture is of an entirely dif
ferent type in many respects.
The Opera House and movie
theaters play only those perform
ances which are acceptable to
Communist ideology. The legiti
mate theater offers only social
ist works (or anti-Nazi plays),
I for example, the works of Bert
i Brecht, or the "Diary of Anne
Frank."
East Berlin has no Kurfursten
damm; its 1,100,000 inhabitants,
whose dress is somewhat inferior
by West Berlin standards, stay at
home.
The buildings run a poor sec
ond in style and quality to those
in the West. The •showplace of
East Berlin, the Stalinallee, is a
thin layer of buildings in Ihe "old

Moscow style" lining one street;
behind them lie piles of rubble
and ruin which have not been
moved for years. There are few
good restaurants and decent
hotels, if any, and the Western
visitor is far from welcome.
The overwhelming impression
of life in East Berlin is the ever
present propaganda. In a subway
station one reads a billboard,
"The Vietnamese people are fight
ing for peace and freedom and a
new life in friendship with the
strong Socialist nations." (Doves
of peace are pictured in the hands
of some Vietnamese peasants.)
On the facade of the Museum
of German History, a large red
sign proclaims, "Long live the
German Democratic Republic, the
fii'.st rightful German state!" In
Karl Marx Square where all Com
munist parades are held, a huge
red banner states, "Socialism will
conquer!"
How do the people react to this
situation? Many claim that the
East Berliners and East Germans
do not believe the signs and their
words, but I wonder. If you had
been forced to read lies for 10
years, would you not become ac
customed to them and perhaps
begin to believe them?

The 2,200,000 citizens of West
Berlin are very energetic and
very friendly, anxious to live a
normal life, culturally and so
cially, in spite of the isolation of
their city.
The Oprea House is rebuilt and
offers a full program of high
quality performances. There are
theaters which offer the latest in
stage plays. Not to be neglected
are the "political satire" cafes,
where world politics are lam
pooned before packed houses.
East Berlin is also culturally
minded regarding- good operas
and plays, but one notices that
their culture is of an entirely dif
ferent type in many respects.
The Opera House and movie
theaters play only those perform
ances which are acceptable to
Communist ideology. The legiti
mate theater offers only social
ist works (or anti-Nazi plays),
I for example, the works of Bert
i Brecht, or the "Diary of Anne
Frank."
East Berlin has no Kurfursten
damm; its 1,100,000 inhabitants,
whose dress is somewhat inferior
by West Berlin standards, stay at
home.
The buildings run a poor sec
ond in style and quality to those
in the West. The •showplace of
East Berlin, the Stalinallee, is a
thin layer of buildings in Ihe "old

Moscow style" lining one street;
behind them lie piles of rubble
and ruin which have not been
moved for years. There are few
good restaurants and decent
hotels, if any, and the Western
visitor is far from welcome.
The overwhelming impression
of life in East Berlin is the ever
present propaganda. In a subway
station one reads a billboard,
"The Vietnamese people are fight
ing for peace and freedom and a
new life in friendship with the
strong Socialist nations." (Doves
of peace are pictured in the hands
of some Vietnamese peasants.)
On the facade of the Museum
of German History, a large red
sign proclaims, "Long live the
German Democratic Republic, the
fii'.st rightful German state!" In
Karl Marx Square where all Com
munist parades are held, a huge
red banner states, "Socialism will
conquer!"
How do the people react to this
situation? Many claim that the
East Berliners and East Germans
do not believe the signs and their
words, but I wonder. If you had
been forced to read lies for 10
years, would you not become ac
customed to them and perhaps
begin to believe them?
It is inevitable that any report
