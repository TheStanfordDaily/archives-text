Editor, the Daily:
The Stanford Symphony Or
chestra presented a concert Tues
day evening, a program I had
eagerly awaited from the begin
ning of the quarter. The evening
of the concert, however, I and a
large number of others were dis
appointed, for all the tickets had
been sold ahead of lime.
I realize that I am partly at
fault for missing the concert; I
could have purchased my licket
ahead. But this does not alter Ihe
fact that there were more people
who wanted to hear the program
than could be accomodated. It
seems to me very wrong to turn
anyone away from such a cultural
attraction.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium is, I
am sure, the best place, acoustic
ally speaking, but we have two
other auditoriums of greater size,
and I feel that the sacrifice of
acoustics should be made for the
sake of the audience. Another al
ternative would have been to
have the concert played two dif
ferent nights.
In any case, persons who wish
to hear a concert such as this one
should not be turned away if
there is a way to avoid it.
