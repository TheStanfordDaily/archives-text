Editor, the Daily:
I am pleased a committee was
formed and investigated some of
the courses available on commu
nism as well as the prospects for
more extensive study.
However, apparently they over
looked a leading scholar in the
field, Dr. North, who is currently
giving a course on Comparative
Marxist Theory.
There is an effective way to
expose a majority of the student
body to the basic Communist
theories and their application
today without establishing pre
requisites and upper division
courses.
An adequate reading of the
writ in g s of key Communist
i theorists would only require a
I week's reading list. Therefore,
each of several departments (po
| litical science, psychology, eco-
I nomics, sociology) should either
j include this as a definite segment
I of a present course or offer a
| minimal unit course stressing the
| aspect of their department's in
] terest.
Pre-requisites would not be
| necessary since the subject is not
1 that difficult nor extensive. How-
I ever, there are few scholars in
! the nation who feel prepared to
! competently present the complete

sociological and phychological
impact of contemporary commu
nism. Perhaps one of these each
year might be invited to the cam
pus for a specific supplementary
course.
I feel these proposals would be
the appropriate means to effect
the end so many of us desire —to
effectively combat communism
after thoroughly understanding it.

Editor, the Daily:
I would like to direct this letter
to the whole student body, and
especially to the Freshman Class,
in the hope that it will spare some
pain. Because I had been drink
ing in the dormitory, for 4*■>
hours on Monday night I had to
face myself and the Freshman
Men's Council and prove that I
should not be suspended immedi
ately in view of my serious of
fense and the attitude which
made the violation inevitable. 1!
am writing this letter at the sug-1
gestion of the Council, so that i
my experience may be of some
value to the student body.
The attitude I had is one which
I feel is prevalent among my
classmates. I, like nearly every
one, feared the law. But I did not i

have the respect for the Funda
mental Standard, either for its
rules or its spirit, to prevent the
incident from occurring.
Neither I nor my companions
had a strong feeling that we were
doing anything more wrong than
playing the popular game of try
ing to get away with breaking a
rule that is distasteful. We did
not have the respect for the way
of life that the Fundamental
Standard stands for to think of
what we were doing.
This painful experience has
forced me to change my attitude.
I have come to realize that an
ethical stand such as the Funda
mental Standard is more than a
set of rules. It establishes a mode
of general conduct that every
Stanford student should feel
obliged to try and live up to, if
he is to keep the right to remain
here.
The University policy on drink
ing is being enforced at Wilbur.
Anyone who breaks it is acting

foolishly. On the practical level,
the risk is tremendous. More im
portant is the damage that can
be done to your educational proc
ess and to your whole life by har
boring within yourself disregard
for the spirit of the law.
Stanford is more than class and
study, it is also an education in
living with the world. Respect for
law is part of this. Respect docs
not entail unquestioning adher
ence to the letter of the law. It
does involve more than cowardly
dodging. It would seem to me that
the way to change tilings is to
protest, but at the same time
obey.
The Fundamental Standard is
not easy to live with. But if we
had wanted an easier time, we
would have gone to another
school. We are capable of taking
the hard way in our academic
life. We should also be willing to
get tough when it comes to our
moral obligations.
