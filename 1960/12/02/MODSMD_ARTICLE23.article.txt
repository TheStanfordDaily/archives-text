# Gaels Down Indians, 48-41
## 
### KEN DERY 
Stanford's nervous Indians bat
tled St. Mary's light down to the
last three minutes last night in
the Pavilion, but finally bowed
4H-41.
Early in the second half a fight
broke out as Gael Coach Jim
Weaver came running over to the
scorer's table screaming for the
score. When he attempted to use
the buzzer an act clearly against
the rules a Stanford assistant
trainer tried to restrain him.
There was more screaming than
anything else and the scuffle
quickly ended.
The lead see-sawed back and
forth in the second half and the
score was lied at 27, 29, 33 and
34.
The late scoring of Tom Mes
chery, who was held to five points
in the first half, turned the tide
and the 6-6 forward ended with
17 points to lead both teams. Cen
ter Rich Hosley hit 13 counters
and forward John Windsor 12 for
the Cards.
WITH about five minutes to go
in the game St. Mary's guard
Gene Womack hit a hook to break
a 31-34 tie and put the Gaels ahead
for goofl.
Center Hamilton Holmes then
hit a fielder to open the lead to
four points the largest spread of
the game and the Cards couldn't
quite catch up.
The first half was marked by
poor shooting by both teams and
a better second half showing
could only bring the averages up
to 28.1 for Stanford and 35.5 for
the Gaels.
TIIK first half ended on a long
hook from the deep corner by

Womack as the Indians left the
floor leading "18-16.

The early shooting of Windsor
kept Stanford in the lead and a
blanket defense on Meschery
seemed to he paying off, but ex
tremely poor offensive nights by
co-captains Bui) Bowling and
John Hendry gave the Gaels the
edge.
COACH Dallmar unleased his
defensive strategy early by send
ing in a steady stream of substi
tutes to wear down Iho Gaels,
but St. Mary's was equal to the
task and the bull-like Meschery
went all the way.
The tiny Pavilion was filled to
capacity and the screaming bor
dered on frenzy as the lead went
back and forth in the second half.

BUB BOWLINC (13) SHOOTS FROM THE OUTSIDE
Phil Kelly (15) Gets Set for a Rebound
Stanford's nervous Indians bat
tled St. Mary's light down to the
last three minutes last night in
the Pavilion, but finally bowed
4H-41.
Early in the second half a fight
broke out as Gael Coach Jim
Weaver came running over to the
scorer's table screaming for the
score. When he attempted to use
the buzzer an act clearly against
the rules a Stanford assistant
trainer tried to restrain him.
There was more screaming than
anything else and the scuffle
quickly ended.
The lead see-sawed back and
forth in the second half and the
score was lied at 27, 29, 33 and
34.
The late scoring of Tom Mes
chery, who was held to five points
in the first half, turned the tide
and the 6-6 forward ended with
17 points to lead both teams. Cen
ter Rich Hosley hit 13 counters
and forward John Windsor 12 for
the Cards.
WITH about five minutes to go
in the game St. Mary's guard
Gene Womack hit a hook to break
a 31-34 tie and put the Gaels ahead
for goofl.
Center Hamilton Holmes then
hit a fielder to open the lead to
four points the largest spread of
the game and the Cards couldn't
quite catch up.
The first half was marked by
poor shooting by both teams and
a better second half showing
could only bring the averages up
to 28.1 for Stanford and 35.5 for
the Gaels.
TIIK first half ended on a long
hook from the deep corner by

Womack as the Indians left the
floor leading "18-16.

The early shooting of Windsor
kept Stanford in the lead and a
blanket defense on Meschery
seemed to he paying off, but ex
tremely poor offensive nights by
co-captains Bui) Bowling and
John Hendry gave the Gaels the
edge.
COACH Dallmar unleased his
defensive strategy early by send
ing in a steady stream of substi
tutes to wear down Iho Gaels,
but St. Mary's was equal to the
task and the bull-like Meschery
went all the way.

quite catch up.
The first half was marked by
poor shooting by both teams and
a better second half showing
could only bring the averages up
to 28.1 for Stanford and 35.5 for
the Gaels.
TIIK first half ended on a long
hook from the deep corner by

Womack as the Indians left the
floor leading "18-16.

The early shooting of Windsor
kept Stanford in the lead and a
blanket defense on Meschery
seemed to he paying off, but ex
tremely poor offensive nights by
co-captains Bui) Bowling and
John Hendry gave the Gaels the
edge.
COACH Dallmar unleased his
defensive strategy early by send
ing in a steady stream of substi
tutes to wear down Iho Gaels,
but St. Mary's was equal to the
task and the bull-like Meschery
went all the way.
The tiny Pavilion was filled to
capacity and the screaming bor
dered on frenzy as the lead went
back and forth in the second half.

Stanford's nervous Indians bat
tled St. Mary's light down to the
last three minutes last night in
the Pavilion, but finally bowed
4H-41.
Early in the second half a fight
broke out as Gael Coach Jim
Weaver came running over to the
scorer's table screaming for the
score. When he attempted to use
the buzzer an act clearly against
the rules a Stanford assistant
trainer tried to restrain him.
There was more screaming than
anything else and the scuffle
quickly ended.
The lead see-sawed back and
forth in the second half and the
score was lied at 27, 29, 33 and
34.
The late scoring of Tom Mes
chery, who was held to five points
in the first half, turned the tide
and the 6-6 forward ended with
17 points to lead both teams. Cen
ter Rich Hosley hit 13 counters
and forward John Windsor 12 for
the Cards.
WITH about five minutes to go
in the game St. Mary's guard
Gene Womack hit a hook to break
a 31-34 tie and put the Gaels ahead
for goofl.
Center Hamilton Holmes then
hit a fielder to open the lead to
four points the largest spread of
the game and the Cards couldn't
quite catch up.
The first half was marked by
