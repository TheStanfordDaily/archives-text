December 16 might mark the date that most of the Stanford
scholars wind up their last final, do a little hurried packing and head
for home but for Coach Howie Dallmar's basketball contingent the
end of finals week marks the start of a busy holiday hoop schedule.
AFT Kit MEETING highly rated Utah in the pavilion tomorrow

night, the Indians take a two
week breather, only to return to
the wars with a game on the 17th
against USF, followed by clashes
with Santa Clara and Washington
State.
Then the locals wrap up their
"vacation" with an appearance at

All of Stanford's 1960-61
basketball games will be
broadcast over KCI3S, includ
ing tomorrow's contest with
Utah. Don Klein will do ihe
play-by-play during Stanford's
liome and away games.
Broadcast of tomorrow's
game will start at 8:10 p.m.

the three-day Los Angeles Basket
ball Classic.
Utah has lost lour of their best
veterans from the 1959 squad
which compiled a 26-3 record, but
they've got Bill "The Hill" McGill
returning and he spells trouble

for the Cards. McGill, one of the
most publicized sophomeres last
year, hit for more than 15 points
per game for the Utes and used
his 6-9 frame effectively on the
backboards.
ALSO SERVING to hinder Card
frontliners .John Windsor, Rich
I-fosley and John Hendry are f>-7
Jim Thomas and 6-3 Boh Cozby.
Both are newcomers and are rated
as potential stars.
Tomorrow's fray will mark the
sixth meeting of the two schools
and the only time Stanford came
out on top was way back in 1936,
topping the Utes by a convincing
76-46.
The Indians travel 1o USF to
play on the city school's home
court. For the last three years
the Red hoopmen have had the
upper hand over their northern
rivals; against the Dons Stanford
has won three and lost none since
1958 but the games have been

close. In fact since 1951 six out
of the seven SU-USF games have
been decided by eight points or
less.
A WELL-KNOWN performer!
on the Don quint is 6-1 Charley I
Range, a reliable backcourt man.
Adding height are Fred Bruener,!
6-8; Bob Ralls, 6-5; and 6-5 John j
Galten while Bob Gaillard pro-1
vides a scoring threat with his)
deft touch on jump shots.
There's a short breather, then
the cagers are back at work again,
hosting the Santa Clara Broncos
December 20. Like tho Dons, the
Broncos have played Stanford on j
fairly even terms. The series I
stands at six wins for the Farm
and five victories for the Broncs
since 1950.
This season Coach Bob Feerick j
has only two returning starters
but he has a host of sophomores
up" from the 1960 Santa Clara
frosh team which won 20 while
losing two. Among the best sophs ■
are 6-7 .Top Weiss, who plays the
pivot, 6-8 forward Gene Shields i
and 6-6 center Leroy Jackson.
ON THE following night an old
PCC opponent, Washington State
University, invades the cramped
conlnes of the Stanford basketball
palace. The Cougars have all but
one starter returning from a
squad which finished 13-13 last
winter.
Sharpshooting Terry Ball scores !
from his guard spot and 6-6 Char- j
lie Sells operates from the for
ward slot and is ranked among
the all-time best WSU cagers.
Stanford clobbered the Wash
ington outfit in their first meet-J
ing of the '59-'6O campaign, win
ning 57-44. The second game also |
went to the Indians, this one a
67-58 overtime affair.
LAST STOP for the home quint j
over 1 the vacations will be the Los
Angeles Classic, an eight-team
tour nament hosted by UCLA and !
USC. Besides Stanford and the
two Los Angeles colleges. Califor
nia and four Midwest fives Indi
ana, lowa, Michigan State and
Minnesota—are slaied to compete.
Last year Cal, led by All-Ameri
can Darrall Imhoff, beat West
Virginia, 65-45, in the finals to
take the tourney.
Indiana is favored to win the
title this time and ihe Cards have
the poor fortune to draw the Hoo
siers in the opening round. Coach
Branch McCraeken has a good, i
well-rounded team that can fast
break, but ihe big attraction for
ihe Midwesterners is All-Ameri-j
can Walt Bellamv who also played

on the gold medal winning U.S.
Olympic hoop learn.
BELLAMY lowers at 6-11 and
ho averages over 20 points per
game, at the same lime picking
ihe boards clean. Eight other lei
lermen return to make Indiana
one of Ihe top teams in pre-season
polls.
Of Ihe other Midwest compeli
lors, lowa should be ihe toughest
with Minnesota close behind.

Utah has lost lour of their best
veterans from the 1959 squad
which compiled a 26-3 record, but
they've got Bill "The Hill" McGill
returning and he spells trouble

for the Cards. McGill, one of the
most publicized sophomeres last

his 6-9 frame effectively on the
backboards.

frontliners .John Windsor, Rich

Jim Thomas and 6-3 Boh Cozby.
Both are newcomers and are rated

Tomorrow's fray will mark the
sixth meeting of the two schools
and the only time Stanford came
out on top was way back in 1936,
topping the Utes by a convincing
76-46.
The Indians travel 1o USF to
play on the city school's home
court. For the last three years
the Red hoopmen have had the
upper hand over their northern
rivals; against the Dons Stanford
has won three and lost none since
1958 but the games have been

close. In fact since 1951 six out
of the seven SU-USF games have
been decided by eight points or
less.
A WELL-KNOWN performer!

December 20. Like tho Dons, the
Broncos have played Stanford on j
fairly even terms. The series I
stands at six wins for the Farm
and five victories for the Broncs
since 1950.
This season Coach Bob Feerick j
has only two returning starters
but he has a host of sophomores

losing two. Among the best sophs ■
are 6-7 .Top Weiss, who plays the
pivot, 6-8 forward Gene Shields i
and 6-6 center Leroy Jackson.
ON THE following night an old
PCC opponent, Washington State
University, invades the cramped

palace. The Cougars have all but
one starter returning from a
squad which finished 13-13 last
winter.

which compiled a 26-3 record, but
they've got Bill "The Hill" McGill

his 6-9 frame effectively on the
backboards.
