# STANFORD'S LITERARY MAGAZINE
## New Issue of Sequoia Features Works by Burdick and Rexroth 
### JUDY SEABORG 
A well-presented variety of lit
erature. occasionally straight
forward. often subtle, character
izes the Autumn edition of the
Sequoia, Stanford's student liter
ary magazine.
Contributions from Eugene
Burdick, co-author of the best
seller "The Ugly American," now
assistant professor of political sci
ence al Cal. and Ray Higgins,
head of the Cuban â€¢section of the
"Hispanic American Report"
stress the importance of personal
interest in politics in general and
Cuba in particular in two lucid
first-hand accounts.
lIIGtiINK describes the Cuban
situation from two viewpoints
the Cuba of the affluent and the
Cuba of the poor in a personal
and thorough fashion. His analy
sis is honest and objective, his
history interspersed with per
sonal interest.

Of the two pieces of fiction,
Joanna Ostrow's "A Self-Confi
dent Color" is the more percep
tive and convincing. Her portrait
of the pride of the blind is well
painted. although it could have
been just as successful without
the introduction of crime.
"A BRIGHT Checkered Skirt"
by Arvin Brown tries to present
a character through dialogue, but
shows either too many examples
or too few. Fewer would make
personality simpler, more would
dispel the reader's confusion. Al
though the story is entertaining,
! the woman, a teacher who is
! forced to resign because of some
indiscreet situation with a male
'student, remains as unknown as
| the teasingly-hinted at situation.
The poetry as a whole is sub
jectively meaningful and includes
translations by Kenneth Rexroth
of six love poems by French au
thors Lucien Meeker. Pierre Sog
' hers, and Francis Carco, and con

tribuiions from M. Scott Moma
day, a freshman English instruc
tor who last year won the Acad
emy of American Poets prize;
Juriilh Rascoe, a junior majoring
iu English literalure; and Fred
erick Levy, who is currently
working in American and English
literature under Yvor Winters,
and who held (lie John M.
Schweitzer Scholarship in Speech
and Drama.
INVITINGLY illustrated, the
magazine includes a section of
photographs of people children,
adults and the elderly in many
situations.
Editor Gary Dickson concludes
with a semi-serious polemic on
Stanford women which may be
taken satirically, but which will
at least arouse comment.
The Sequoia will be on sale
next Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday for 50 cents. Its til
pages are worth much more than
the penny apiece they cost.
