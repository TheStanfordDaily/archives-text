## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Presi
dentelect John F. Kennedy yes
terday named Gov. Abraham Rib-1
| icoff of Connecticut as his Secre- i
itary of Health, Education and j
Welfare. He said the post will |
I involve some of the "most chal
-1 lenging and significant" programs
of his administration.
Kennedy announced his first I
{cabinet choice shortly after he)
! picked another Democratic gover-
I nor — G. Mennen Williams of
' Michigan—to serve as assistant!
secretary of state for Africa. He
said this post was second to none
! where U.S. foreign interests were
I concerned.
THE President-elect announced
i the appointment of Ribicoff, an i
i "old friend and distinguished pub- j
i lie servant," from the steps of his i
j Washington home. Both stood'
bareheaded in a chilling wind as
Kennedy said he had convinced i
Ribicoff that he was needed in a j
high national office.
Kennedy ticked off the "broad
and expanding activities" of the
welfare department in a state
; ment which served notice that he
j intended to push vigorously his j
| medical care for the aged and
other controversial programs.
"NOT ONLY does this depart
ment already perform a broad
range of important responsibili
ties," he said, "but under its di
rection will take place some of!
| the most challenging and signifi-i
cant activities and programs of!
J the years to come."
j Kennedy, obviously nearing fi
| nal decision on a number of ap-'
pointments, indicated that he!
would name Harvard Professor I
! David Bell to a federal post today,
probably as Budget Director. An
j other possibility was in interim
! fiscal representative to the Eisen
i hovver administration.
The President-elect, who flies
:to Palm Beach, Fla., today for
the weekend, also probably will
| disclose one or more federal ap
pointments there Saturday.
KENNEDY ALSO MET yester
day with Rep. Stewart L. Udall,
10-year-old New Mexico Democrat
■ who helped deliver his state's con* [
| vent ion delegates to Kennedy in
stead of Senate Democratic Lead-1
|cr Lyndon B. Johnson. Udall has |
been described as a likely choice I
j for Secretary of Interior. But if'
Kennedy has made up his mind,!
! he wasn't talking.
