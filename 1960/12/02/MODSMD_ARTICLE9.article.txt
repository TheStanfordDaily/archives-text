# Posting of Past Tests Requested for Finals
## 
### 
Getting worried about those finals?
One excellent means of studying for finals is to review the
past examinations of the courseâ€”and it's officially recognized
by the Dean's Office!
The Fundamental Standard Commission recommends that
all students request their professors to make a copy of last year's
final available. Members of the Commission have asked the
heads of every department to have each professor post a final
on the department's bulletin board.
They hope that this will eliminate the unfair advantage of
students who have been able to obtain some rare copy of the
previous year's final and will allow all students to make use of
this study method.
Students are also requested to tell a member of the Funda
mental Standard Commission about any test which they feel is
not appropriate to the course in which it is given. This type of
improvement in the education program can only be made if
students tell members of the Commission about problems that
exist.
The Commission also welcomes any suggestions students
have concerning the administration of finals.
