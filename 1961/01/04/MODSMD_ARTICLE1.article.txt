Sometime in 1963, Stanford's physics students will leave Physics
Corner forever and take up their work across the street in tlie new
three-story, $2,500,000 Russell H. Varian Laboratory of Physics.
A call for contractors' bids to build the addition to the Science
Quad will go out soon, according to a University announcement.

Designed by Architect Gardner
A. Dailey of San Francisco, the
building is scheduled for con-struc
tion to begin early next year. It
will take a little more than a year
to build.
Upon completion, Stanford's
Physics Department will vacate
its present dilapidated quarters in
Physics Corner and move into the
1 new structure.
THE PHYSICS Department's
shift into its new quarters will
signal the start of renovation in
j the emptied building, which is
part of the original Main Quad
architecture. This will be another
major project, expected to cost
over $1 million.
Plans for complete re-landseap
ing of the area between Main
Quad and the area where the new
building will be and where the
Physics Lecture Hall is are being
drawn up by San Francisco land
scape architect Thomas D.
Church.
That work will involve closing
Lomita Drive from Panama
Street at the corner where the
Press and The Daily Shack are
located, to Physics Corner.
AT THE SAME time, Campus
Drive — which starts at: Palm
Drive and runs past Encina Gym,
behind the eating clubs, Wilbur.
Stern and in front of Moore until
it ends at Lake Lagunita — will
be extended to go behind the Sci
ence Quad and connect with its
j other branch which runs in front
of the Medical Center.
Campus Drive is slated eventu
ally to become the man campus
traffic artery, and now skirts
three-fourths of the educational
part of the campus.
The new Varian building will
contain more than 60 offices and
over 50 individual laboratories.
Six will be large teaching labs.
Only one classroom is provided,
but the new structure will be adja
cent on the north and connected
to the present Physics "Tank" by
an arcade.
A ONE-STORY building ad
joining the arcade will house the
departmental office.
With 76.000 square feet of floor
space in all. the new building will
have a 4,000-squaro-foot Physics
Library on the third floor. The
total space is divided between
three upper floors and a base
ment.
Construction will be of poured
concrete with contrasting textures
and buff colors to harmonize with
architecture of the Main Quad.
The red tile roof will match those
of the Main Quad.
FUNDS FOR the much-needed
new space will come from various
donors, including the widow of
Russell H. Varian, the inventor of
the klystron tube and a founder of
I the Varian Associates firm in the
j Stanford Industrial Park.
Over half the cost will be cov
ered by gifts from Mrs. Varian.
Varian Associates, and the largest
gift from the Varian Foundation
a philanthropic organization
formed last year through a major
bequest in the will of Varian.
Grants of $400,000 from the Na
tional Science Foundation and
$300,000 from the Ford Founda
tion, plus gifts from the C. F.
Braun Trust of Alhambra and
from Eitel-McCullough Inc., of
San Bruno, complete the list.
THE BALANCE will come from
the University's klystron royal
ties. which grew out of Varian's
early research at Stanford with
various faculty members.
"Stanford has long benefited
1 from Russell Varian's genius and
: generosity," commented Leonard
I. Schiff. head of the Physics De
partment.
"Over the years he and Mrs.
Varian have made numerous gifts
to the University, which he loved,
and have contributed greatly to
its welfare and to the develop
ment of the Physics Department.
"IT is especially appropriate
that the new physics building
should be named for him, since lie
shared our hopes for it and con
tributed so much toward their
realization."
