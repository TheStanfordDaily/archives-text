VIENTIANE, Laos (UPI> Communist-led Laotian rebels claimed
last night they had recaptured the key central Laotian town of Xieng
Khouang in a major victory and sent spearheads driving toward
southern Laos.
(Radio Thailand said in Bangkok thai pro-Communist forces
were also moving northward toward the royal capital of Luang
Prabang and had reached a point wilhin 20 miles of the royal seat.)
While the Communists were reporting new successes, King
Savang Vathana dealt them a major diplomatic and propaganda sel
baek by convening parliament for a three-day session to invest pro-
Western Prince Boun Oum as premier.

ONE BROADCAST from the clandestine Communist Pat bet Lao
radio said forces under paratroop Capt. Kong Le "annihilated" an en
tire company of pro-Western Laotian paratroopers dropped on the
Plain of Jars to try to win Xieng Khouang from the Reds.
Xieng Khouang, in the center of a complex of airfields, is a key
military position in the defense of Laos and blocks the Communist
approaches to the rest of Southeast Asia.
American military officials said any such rebel victory must have
been achieved with outside help.
THE REBEL RADIOS reported control of all of Xieng Khouang
province and said columns of troops were moving on the provincial
capitals of Savannakhet and Thakhet in southern Laos while other
guerrillas were active around Pakse and along the colonial road
leading to South Viet Nam.
