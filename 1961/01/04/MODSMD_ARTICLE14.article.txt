# A 						Widening Rift?

### 
The Laotian situation lias brought to the surface a problem
facing the \\ estern allies which must be solved quickly. The U.S.,
Great Britain ami France are unable to reach an agreement as to
how the West should handle the Laotian crisis.
In the past, the U.S. has been more or less accepted by the West
ern European nations as promulgator of Western foreign policy.
The situation has now changed, however. Western Europe is no
longer as economically dependent upon the U.S. We helped Europe
to recover but it doesn't feel it owes us anything politically, and
rightfully so.
The widening rift between U.S. and Western European outlook
can be clearly seen in NATO. NATO was created from the Mar
shall Plan. The U.S., because of its superior military and economic
might, assumed leadership. But U.S. leadership has faltered ever
since NATO's inception. And while the U.S. has failed to take
command, Western Europe continues to grow economically, and
consequently politically, independent.
At tlie present time there is no leader among the NATO allies.
The need for a leader, however, is urgent. Petty differences among
the allies which cannot be reconciled by some leader nation is just
what the communists like and NATO ostensibly exists in order to
combat Communism.
The rift is not only evident between the U.S. and Western Eu
rope, but among other NATO partners as well. At the last U.N.
session Greece voted against Portugal simply because Portugal had
previously voted against Greece. There are scores of other such in
cidents that could be cited.
Wasl lington must create a formula to bind our allies so that a
united front can exist. One possible solution is for NATO to dis
cuss its internal disagreements before tliey are publicized. The
U.S. should also take strong stands in conferences discussing prob
lems on other continents. The U.S. failed to do this in regard to
Belgium and the Congo. >
Western Europe, in spite of its growing independence, must
still look to the U.S. for guidance and leadership and it is up to
the U.S. to fulfill its duty. If it doesn't, Western Europe might con
tinue to drift away from the U.S., the consequences of which are
not difficult to foresee.

still look to the U.S. for guidance and leadership and it is up to
the U.S. to fulfill its duty. If it doesn't, Western Europe might con
tinue to drift away from the U.S., the consequences of which are
not difficult to foresee.
The Laotian situation lias brought to the surface a problem
facing the \\ estern allies which must be solved quickly. The U.S.,
Great Britain ami France are unable to reach an agreement as to
how the West should handle the Laotian crisis.
In the past, the U.S. has been more or less accepted by the West
ern European nations as promulgator of Western foreign policy.
The situation has now changed, however. Western Europe is no
longer as economically dependent upon the U.S. We helped Europe
to recover but it doesn't feel it owes us anything politically, and
rightfully so.
The widening rift between U.S. and Western European outlook
can be clearly seen in NATO. NATO was created from the Mar
shall Plan. The U.S., because of its superior military and economic
might, assumed leadership. But U.S. leadership has faltered ever
since NATO's inception. And while the U.S. has failed to take
command, Western Europe continues to grow economically, and
consequently politically, independent.
At tlie present time there is no leader among the NATO allies.
The need for a leader, however, is urgent. Petty differences among
the allies which cannot be reconciled by some leader nation is just
what the communists like and NATO ostensibly exists in order to
combat Communism.
The rift is not only evident between the U.S. and Western Eu
rope, but among other NATO partners as well. At the last U.N.
session Greece voted against Portugal simply because Portugal had
previously voted against Greece. There are scores of other such in
cidents that could be cited.
Wasl lington must create a formula to bind our allies so that a
united front can exist. One possible solution is for NATO to dis
cuss its internal disagreements before tliey are publicized. The
U.S. should also take strong stands in conferences discussing prob
lems on other continents. The U.S. failed to do this in regard to
Belgium and the Congo. >
Western Europe, in spite of its growing independence, must
still look to the U.S. for guidance and leadership and it is up to
the U.S. to fulfill its duty. If it doesn't, Western Europe might con
tinue to drift away from the U.S., the consequences of which are
not difficult to foresee.
