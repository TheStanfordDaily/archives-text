# Dictators and U.S.
## 
### BILL HAWTHORNE IIR Conference Division 
America's military and eco
nomic aid to dictators in the un
derdeveloped countries has seri
ously weakened her foreign policy.
These dictators make up part of
the important defense system of
the free wovld and yet, are some
of the world's most tyrannical and
ruthless leaders.
Our support of these men has
caused many people in the under
developed world to look elsewhere
for moral leadership. Our dilem
ma is how to maintain an ade
quate defense system with these
dictators and still wage a strong
ideological war in the uncommit
ted world.
Stanford students will he given
the opportunity tonight to express
their views and hear the opinion
of others on the resolution, "Sup
port of dictators is valid foreign
policy." Richard Noble will speak
for the affirmative and Kenneth
Purcell for the negative to begin
the open debate which will be held
at 7:31) p.m. in the Women's Club
house.
In tonight's debate, these small
dictators should not be confused
with the nationalist leaders, such
as Nkrumah of Ghana, Sukarno
of Indonesia or Nasser of Egypt.
These nationalist leaders, al
though they occasionally use au
thoritarian methods, escape the
international unpopularity of the
small dictators.
They usually come to power by
a popular nationalist revolution or
election and are not classed as dic
tators by the underdeveloped
world.
It is (he dictators such as
Chiang Kai-shek and Trujillo who
present this dilemma to American
foreign policy. These dictators
are usually strongly anti-Com
munist and have received Ameri
can military aid at one time or
another.
They are generally maintained
in power by powerful minority
groups such as the army or police,
which depend on this aid. They
are usually unpopular with a ma
jority of their own people and the
rest of the underdeveloped world.
Our dilemma, in respect to

these dictators, has arisen because
of America's pursuit of two con
tradictory policies. The U.S. has
been trying to form a system of
alliances ihat would create a de
lense fore? strong enough to deter
or repel Communist aggression.
In the pursuit of this policy the
State Department has been will
ing to accent the aid of any anti-
Communist government regard
less of its political system. In the
past these small dictators or au
thoritarian leaders have made up
a large part of this defense sys
tem. Rhee of Korea, Fisal of Iraq,
Menderes of Turkey, Franco of
; Spain, Trujillo of the Dominican
i Republic and Batista of Cuba.
Fearing a nationalist revolution
with a neutralist or anti-American
j coloring, the U.S. has tried to
i stabilize the government by eco
i nornic aid. This economic aid, in
i the form of gifts, loans and pri
vate investments, results in a fur
ther commitment by America to
support the existing government.
This support raises doubts in
the minds of the people of the
underdeveloped world as to Amer
ica's moral leadership. This doubt
hinders the success of a second
policy of the State Department.
This policy tries to stop the ad
vance of communism in the tm
derdeveloped countries. It tries
to create an image of America as
the leading supporter of demo
cratic freedoms. This policy has
little success to the people who
see America support men like
Franco.
Therefore, the question is, how
can we support the dictators in
our alliance system and pose as
the leading supporter of demo
cratic freedoms?
What is the solution to our di
lemma? Are we to withdraw our
support from these men with the
knowledge that they will probably
fall prey to an anti-US. revolution
anyway? Are we to waste more
money on the gamble that the
revolution will be like Korea?
What of the rest of the under
developed world if we continue
support? What of our defense sys
tem If we do not? Perhaps some
of these questions will be an
swered at the debate tonight.

America's military and eco
nomic aid to dictators in the un
derdeveloped countries has seri
ously weakened her foreign policy.
These dictators make up part of
the important defense system of
the free wovld and yet, are some
of the world's most tyrannical and
ruthless leaders.
Our support of these men has
caused many people in the under
developed world to look elsewhere
for moral leadership. Our dilem
ma is how to maintain an ade
quate defense system with these
dictators and still wage a strong
ideological war in the uncommit

Stanford students will he given
the opportunity tonight to express
their views and hear the opinion
of others on the resolution, "Sup
port of dictators is valid foreign
policy." Richard Noble will speak
for the affirmative and Kenneth
Purcell for the negative to begin
the open debate which will be held
at 7:31) p.m. in the Women's Club
house.
In tonight's debate, these small
dictators should not be confused
with the nationalist leaders, such
as Nkrumah of Ghana, Sukarno
of Indonesia or Nasser of Egypt.
These nationalist leaders, al
though they occasionally use au
thoritarian methods, escape the
international unpopularity of the
small dictators.
They usually come to power by
a popular nationalist revolution or
election and are not classed as dic
tators by the underdeveloped
world.
It is (he dictators such as
Chiang Kai-shek and Trujillo who
present this dilemma to American
foreign policy. These dictators
are usually strongly anti-Com
munist and have received Ameri
can military aid at one time or
another.
They are generally maintained
in power by powerful minority
groups such as the army or police,
which depend on this aid. They
are usually unpopular with a ma
jority of their own people and the
rest of the underdeveloped world.
Our dilemma, in respect to

these dictators, has arisen because
of America's pursuit of two con
tradictory policies. The U.S. has
been trying to form a system of
alliances ihat would create a de
lense fore? strong enough to deter
or repel Communist aggression.
In the pursuit of this policy the
State Department has been will
ing to accent the aid of any anti-
Communist government regard
less of its political system. In the
past these small dictators or au
thoritarian leaders have made up
a large part of this defense sys
tem. Rhee of Korea, Fisal of Iraq,
Menderes of Turkey, Franco of
; Spain, Trujillo of the Dominican
i Republic and Batista of Cuba.
Fearing a nationalist revolution
with a neutralist or anti-American
j coloring, the U.S. has tried to
i stabilize the government by eco
i nornic aid. This economic aid, in
i the form of gifts, loans and pri
vate investments, results in a fur
ther commitment by America to
support the existing government.
This support raises doubts in
the minds of the people of the
underdeveloped world as to Amer
ica's moral leadership. This doubt
hinders the success of a second
policy of the State Department.
This policy tries to stop the ad
vance of communism in the tm
derdeveloped countries. It tries
to create an image of America as
the leading supporter of demo
cratic freedoms. This policy has
little success to the people who
see America support men like
Franco.
Therefore, the question is, how
can we support the dictators in
our alliance system and pose as
the leading supporter of demo
cratic freedoms?
What is the solution to our di
lemma? Are we to withdraw our
support from these men with the
knowledge that they will probably
fall prey to an anti-US. revolution
anyway? Are we to waste more
money on the gamble that the
revolution will be like Korea?
What of the rest of the under

support? What of our defense sys
