A popular theory amongst
American intellectuals concerns
the more serious and mature out
look the European college student
obtains in comparison with his
American contemporary.
Many American academicians
believe that while the American
student is wasting his time away
decorating his fraternity house
> for a weekend orgy, his European
counterpart is either deeply in
volved in some scholastic en
deavor or wrapped up in discus
sion of the serious problems of
the world.
This writer traveling in Europe
and coming in contact with many
European students has found this
popular condemnation of Ameri
can collegians and glamourization
of European students to be some
thing of a myth.
It is true that many if not all
the universities in Europe refrain
from having extracurricular ac
tivities, especially an activity as
glamourized and overemphasized
as American football. However,
this does not prevent the Euro
pean students from spending a
good many hours away from bis
studies in activities not adding
greatly to his intellectual improve
ment.
Attendance at classes and lec
tures in Europe is rarely recorded
and the student is free to choose
whether he wishes to attend or
not. Again contrary to popular be
lief, there are many at European
universities who prefer a regular
beer to a regular class.
In England, for example, extra
curricular activities are often
taken as seriously if not more se
riously than regular courses. It is
not uncommon for the President
of the Oxford Debating Society to
drop a majority of his courses
during his term to concentrate al
most completely on his presi-!
dency.
As for the concern of the Euro
pean student for world affairs,
that also seems to have been some
what overglamourized in the U.S.
There are many young Europeans
quite gravely concerned with
world affairs, but it is not correct
to say this very select group rep
resents even the majority of Euro
pean students. There is also a
goodly number which prefer to be
uninformed and fancy free.
American students seem to have
a greater grasp and concern with
the problems of world affairs.
Tins can l»e related to the fact that
many European students feel that
Iheir countries would have so little
to say in any real serious world
conflict that they would just as
soon leave the problems of the
world to the Russians and to the
Americans, whom they believe
will end up making the decisions
anyway.
The Hungarian revolt did much
to prove to a great many Euro
pean students, especially those
near to Hungary, that their coun
tries and the voices of their peo
ple meant little. The Americans
through radio broadcasts encour
aged the Hungarians to revolt but
once the fighting began did little
but stand by and watch the
slaughter.

To the European, in many cases,
the struggle is one between Rus
sia and the U.S. and as far as they
are concerned they would prefer
these two nations to settle the
Congo problem, Cuba, China, etc.
if they would just leave Europe
in peace.
An Austrian student when
asked what he would do if the
Communists tried to step back
into that country, replied he
would probably do little to pre
vent it and that probably few of
his friends would either.
His reasons for doing 1 nothing
were not lhat lie didn't prefer his
current way of life to communism,
but that his little bit of protest
would be worthless in the face of
the Communists and the United
States would probably sell him
out.
There is one way, however, in
which the European student de
cidedly outshines the American
and that is in the language de
partment. Most European stu
dents speak at least two lan-;
guages and many are able to
speak three or four.
It seems that in the U.S. even
the most aware students rarely
speak any other language than
English. An American abroad
must hope that the natives speak
English.
This phenomenon is most evi
dent in the summer 'when thou
sands of American college stu
dents go to Europe to soak up bits
of Old World culture. Many can
not mix with the public or even
the local students due to language
barriers and because of it many j
lose valuable communication.
Their free time is usually spent
in the American Express convers
ing with other Americans about
bargains they have found or about
things back in Indiana. It is con
ditions like these that help develop
the anti-serious, anti-intellectual 1
stereotype of American students I
among both Europeans and other
Americans.

This writer traveling in Europe
and coming in contact with many
European students has found this
popular condemnation of Ameri
can collegians and glamourization
of European students to be some
thing of a myth.
It is true that many if not all
the universities in Europe refrain
from having extracurricular ac
tivities, especially an activity as
glamourized and overemphasized
as American football. However,
this does not prevent the Euro
pean students from spending a
good many hours away from bis
studies in activities not adding
greatly to his intellectual improve
ment.
Attendance at classes and lec
tures in Europe is rarely recorded
and the student is free to choose
whether he wishes to attend or
not. Again contrary to popular be
lief, there are many at European
universities who prefer a regular
beer to a regular class.
In England, for example, extra
curricular activities are often
taken as seriously if not more se
riously than regular courses. It is
not uncommon for the President
of the Oxford Debating Society to
drop a majority of his courses
during his term to concentrate al
most completely on his presi-!
dency.
As for the concern of the Euro
pean student for world affairs,
that also seems to have been some
what overglamourized in the U.S.
There are many young Europeans
quite gravely concerned with
world affairs, but it is not correct
to say this very select group rep
resents even the majority of Euro
pean students. There is also a
goodly number which prefer to be
uninformed and fancy free.
American students seem to have
a greater grasp and concern with
the problems of world affairs.
Tins can l»e related to the fact that
many European students feel that
Iheir countries would have so little
to say in any real serious world
conflict that they would just as
soon leave the problems of the
world to the Russians and to the
Americans, whom they believe
will end up making the decisions
anyway.
The Hungarian revolt did much
to prove to a great many Euro
pean students, especially those
near to Hungary, that their coun
tries and the voices of their peo
ple meant little. The Americans
through radio broadcasts encour
aged the Hungarians to revolt but
once the fighting began did little
but stand by and watch the
slaughter.

To the European, in many cases,
the struggle is one between Rus
sia and the U.S. and as far as they
are concerned they would prefer
these two nations to settle the
Congo problem, Cuba, China, etc.
if they would just leave Europe
in peace.
An Austrian student when
asked what he would do if the
Communists tried to step back
into that country, replied he
would probably do little to pre
vent it and that probably few of
his friends would either.
His reasons for doing 1 nothing
were not lhat lie didn't prefer his
current way of life to communism,
but that his little bit of protest
would be worthless in the face of
the Communists and the United
States would probably sell him
out.
There is one way, however, in
which the European student de
cidedly outshines the American
and that is in the language de
partment. Most European stu
dents speak at least two lan-;
guages and many are able to
speak three or four.
It seems that in the U.S. even
the most aware students rarely
speak any other language than
English. An American abroad
must hope that the natives speak
English.
This phenomenon is most evi
dent in the summer 'when thou
sands of American college stu
dents go to Europe to soak up bits
of Old World culture. Many can
not mix with the public or even
the local students due to language
barriers and because of it many j
lose valuable communication.
Their free time is usually spent
in the American Express convers
ing with other Americans about
bargains they have found or about
things back in Indiana. It is con
ditions like these that help develop
the anti-serious, anti-intellectual 1
stereotype of American students I
among both Europeans and other
Americans.
A popular theory amongst
American intellectuals concerns
the more serious and mature out
look the European college student
obtains in comparison with his
American contemporary.

popular condemnation of Ameri
can collegians and glamourization
of European students to be some
thing of a myth.
It is true that many if not all
the universities in Europe refrain
from having extracurricular ac
tivities, especially an activity as
glamourized and overemphasized
as American football. However,
this does not prevent the Euro
pean students from spending a
good many hours away from bis
studies in activities not adding
greatly to his intellectual improve
ment.
Attendance at classes and lec
tures in Europe is rarely recorded
and the student is free to choose
whether he wishes to attend or
not. Again contrary to popular be
lief, there are many at European
universities who prefer a regular
beer to a regular class.
In England, for example, extra
curricular activities are often
taken as seriously if not more se
riously than regular courses. It is
not uncommon for the President
of the Oxford Debating Society to
drop a majority of his courses
during his term to concentrate al
most completely on his presi-!
dency.
As for the concern of the Euro
pean student for world affairs,
that also seems to have been some
what overglamourized in the U.S.
There are many young Europeans
quite gravely concerned with
world affairs, but it is not correct
to say this very select group rep
resents even the majority of Euro
pean students. There is also a
goodly number which prefer to be
uninformed and fancy free.
American students seem to have
a greater grasp and concern with
the problems of world affairs.
Tins can l»e related to the fact that
many European students feel that
Iheir countries would have so little
to say in any real serious world
conflict that they would just as
soon leave the problems of the
world to the Russians and to the
Americans, whom they believe
will end up making the decisions
anyway.
The Hungarian revolt did much
to prove to a great many Euro
pean students, especially those
near to Hungary, that their coun
tries and the voices of their peo
ple meant little. The Americans
through radio broadcasts encour
aged the Hungarians to revolt but
once the fighting began did little
but stand by and watch the
slaughter.

To the European, in many cases,
the struggle is one between Rus
sia and the U.S. and as far as they
are concerned they would prefer
these two nations to settle the
Congo problem, Cuba, China, etc.
if they would just leave Europe
in peace.
An Austrian student when
asked what he would do if the
Communists tried to step back
into that country, replied he
would probably do little to pre
vent it and that probably few of
his friends would either.
His reasons for doing 1 nothing
were not lhat lie didn't prefer his
current way of life to communism,
but that his little bit of protest
would be worthless in the face of
the Communists and the United
States would probably sell him
out.
There is one way, however, in
which the European student de
cidedly outshines the American
and that is in the language de
partment. Most European stu
dents speak at least two lan-;
guages and many are able to
speak three or four.
It seems that in the U.S. even
the most aware students rarely
speak any other language than
English. An American abroad
must hope that the natives speak
English.
This phenomenon is most evi
dent in the summer 'when thou
sands of American college stu
dents go to Europe to soak up bits
of Old World culture. Many can
not mix with the public or even
the local students due to language
barriers and because of it many j
lose valuable communication.
Their free time is usually spent
in the American Express convers
ing with other Americans about
bargains they have found or about
things back in Indiana. It is con
ditions like these that help develop
the anti-serious, anti-intellectual 1
stereotype of American students I
among both Europeans and other
Americans.
A popular theory amongst
American intellectuals concerns
the more serious and mature out
look the European college student
obtains in comparison with his
American contemporary.
Many American academicians
believe that while the American
student is wasting his time away
decorating his fraternity house
> for a weekend orgy, his European
counterpart is either deeply in
volved in some scholastic en
deavor or wrapped up in discus
sion of the serious problems of
the world.
