### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
Fordham's first-half shooting,
j colder than Inner Quad at Mid
night these days, gave Stanford a
."59-44 basketball victory in the
Pavilion last night.
The visitors from the Bronx
played the Indians almost even up
in the second half, but they could
never recover from their disas
trous beginnings.
STANF O R I) forward John
Windsor led the scoring with 17
points while Bill Sheridan tanked
13 for Fordham.
It took Fordham nine minutes
to get on the scoreboard and the
Indians, grateful for the oppor
tunity, ran up an 11-0 margin in
that time. Fordham never got
closer than nine points to Ihe In
dians who went on to take a 26-13
half time lead. The Rams con
nected on only six of 22 shots
from the floor in the first period
while Stanford made good on 11
of 35. In the free throw depart
ment Fordham scored only one in
eight attempts.

I The second half was a good deal
! evener as the visitors took exactly
1 the same number of shots, 22, but
hit on 10 of them. From the foul
: line, too, the visitors got hot, hit*
j ting 11 out of 12, almost as good
| as their first half percentage was
| bad.
FORDHAM actually ended up
1 with a better shooting percentage.
36.4 to the Indians' 33.9, but Stan
j ford's ability to take more shots
1 made up for the difference.
The Tribe had control of the
! boards, out-rebounding the Rams
! 49*33.
The Indians opened up to a 19-
i point lead in the second half and
; Fordham managed to cut the lead
|to 50-40 with 4:30 left in the
j game. The Stanford defense stiff
ened, however, and that was as
I close as the Rams could get.
STANFORD Coach Howie Dall
mar cleared the bench late in the
; game.
Windsor's 17 points kept his
I per-game average at about 16. He
scored on several long jump shots
and led both teams in rebounds.
Stanford's next game is at Cal
j on Jan. 10.
