# U.S. Charges Russia With Laos Intervention
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The
United States charged yesterday
that Russia and Communist
North Viet Nam have openly in
tervened in the Laotian civil war
with 184 aerial sorties since Dec.
15 that dropped paratroopers and
supplies into the battleground.
At the same time, however, the
State Department disclosed it has
discussed reviving a three-power
international control commission,
as demanded by Russia and some
of the Western allies, to deal with
the Laotian crisis.
LONDON reports said British
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
favored recalling the commission,
consisting of Canada, India and
Poland, which operated in Laos
from 1954 1o 1958. India also
wants to reactivate the commis
sion to find a peaceful solution to
the explosive situation in the
southeast Asian kingdom.
The State Department said it
was releasing its "hard evidence"
of Communist intervention "in
view of the seriousness of the cur
rent situation in Laos."
It said evidence in its posession
concerns "the extensive Soviet
and North Vietnamese participa
tion in the Communist military
operations against the Royal Lao
Government and Lao people."
Release of the data, ranging
from the number of Communist
flights to the serial numbers on
the planes, came shortly after
President Eisenhower called in his
top military and diplomatic ad
visers for their third emergency
conference on Laos in the last
four days.
Till-; first two conferences pro
duced a U.S. statement that it
would take a serious view of Com
munist intervention in Laos and
an announcement that this conn

j try had alerted its Pacific forces
i for possible action.
In detailing the charges of Com
munist intervention, State Depart
ment Press Officer Joseph Reap
said "This is absolutely firm in
formation. This is not circumstan
tial evidence. This is factual."
In addition to the 184 flights
since Dec. 15. the department said
there were 34 known flights into
Vientiane Airport between Dec. 3
and Dec. 14. which brought in
North Vietnamese troops, howit
zers, ammunition, gasoline, and
j combat rations.
THIS was the first evidence that
North Vietnamese troops entered
Laos that early in the civil war.
when the battle of Vientiane was
being fought and successfully won
by the pro-Western forces of
Prince Boum Oum.
It was not until last weekend
that Boum Oum's government
charged that North Vietnamese
troops were present.
The State Department listed the
serial numbers of nine Soviet air
craft. It said five of them were
1 the same planes which had been
j involved in the clandestine Soviet
j airlift to The Congo.

WASHINGTON (UPI) The
United States charged yesterday
that Russia and Communist
North Viet Nam have openly in
tervened in the Laotian civil war
with 184 aerial sorties since Dec.
15 that dropped paratroopers and
supplies into the battleground.
At the same time, however, the
State Department disclosed it has
discussed reviving a three-power
international control commission,
as demanded by Russia and some
of the Western allies, to deal with
the Laotian crisis.
LONDON reports said British
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
favored recalling the commission,
consisting of Canada, India and
Poland, which operated in Laos
from 1954 1o 1958. India also
wants to reactivate the commis

the explosive situation in the
southeast Asian kingdom.
The State Department said it
was releasing its "hard evidence"
of Communist intervention "in
view of the seriousness of the cur

It said evidence in its posession
concerns "the extensive Soviet
and North Vietnamese participa

operations against the Royal Lao
Government and Lao people."
Release of the data, ranging
from the number of Communist
flights to the serial numbers on
the planes, came shortly after
President Eisenhower called in his
top military and diplomatic ad

conference on Laos in the last
four days.

duced a U.S. statement that it

an announcement that this conn

i for possible action.
In detailing the charges of Com
munist intervention, State Depart
ment Press Officer Joseph Reap
said "This is absolutely firm in
formation. This is not circumstan
tial evidence. This is factual."
In addition to the 184 flights
since Dec. 15. the department said
there were 34 known flights into
Vientiane Airport between Dec. 3
and Dec. 14. which brought in
North Vietnamese troops, howit
zers, ammunition, gasoline, and
