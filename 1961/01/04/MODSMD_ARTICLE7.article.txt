# U.S. Cuts Diplomatic Relations With Castro
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) — The United States last night broke
| diplomatic relations with Cuba. President Eisenhower ordered the
! drastic action, asserting there was "a limit to what the United States
i in self respect can endure."
Eisenhower, reciting what he called "harassments. baseless accu*

sations and vilification" by Fidel
Castro, said Ihe final straw was
the Cuban premier's order dras
tically reducing the U.S. Embassy
in Havana.
At the same time, a State De
partment spokesman in effect
warned Castro to keep hands off
the big U.S. naval base at Guan
tanamo Bay — the target of a
mounting attack by the Cuban
premier and his propagandists.
"THIS HAS no effect at all on
the base," the spokesman said.
While hints of the impending
action had been circulating
through the State Department all
day, the president's formal action
caught many diplomats by sur
prise. The Cuban charge d'affaires
was informed of the action about
the time the White House was an
nouncing it.

ation, set' page 4, column 1.)

the president's decision at a
hastily summoned news confer
ence. said tersely:
"As of 8:30 p.m.. we have broken
diplomatic relations with Cuba."
THU STATE Department im
mediately announced that it was
urging U.S. citizens to consider
leaving Cuba. It also said it would
relay immediate word of the
break to other member nations
of the Organization of American
States (OAS).
The United States was the sev
enth nation to break relations
with the Castro regime, which
came to power two years ago
amid the high hopes of its neigh
bors for the idealistic reforms
promised by Castro.
But the bearded revolutionary
set out on the Communist-style
program of land and industrial
reform, including seizure of Amer
ican-owned property. Castro cli
maxed his romance with the Reds
by accepting Soviet arms aid.
Even as the break in diplomatic
relations was announced here,
Cuban police arrested U.S. Em
bassy Treasurer Stewart H.
Adams on the eve of his sched
uled departure for the United
States along with other American
diplomatic personnel ousted by
Castro.
THERE WAS no immediate in
dication of the charge against
Adams, who was seized in his
home while packing. U.S. Charge
d'Affaires Daniel J. Braddock
promptly contacted the Cuban
Government seeking his release.
The State Department put no
time limit on the departure of
Cuban diplomats from this coun
try but said it would insist on a
reasonable deadline.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The United States last night broke
| diplomatic relations with Cuba. President Eisenhower ordered the
! drastic action, asserting there was "a limit to what the United States
i in self respect can endure."
Eisenhower, reciting what he called "harassments. baseless accu*

sations and vilification" by Fidel
Castro, said Ihe final straw was
the Cuban premier's order dras
tically reducing the U.S. Embassy
in Havana.
At the same time, a State De
partment spokesman in effect
warned Castro to keep hands off
the big U.S. naval base at Guan
tanamo Bay — the target of a
mounting attack by the Cuban
premier and his propagandists.
"THIS HAS no effect at all on
the base," the spokesman said.
While hints of the impending
action had been circulating
through the State Department all
day, the president's formal action
caught many diplomats by sur
prise. The Cuban charge d'affaires
was informed of the action about
the time the White House was an

the president's decision at a
hastily summoned news confer

"As of 8:30 p.m.. we have broken
diplomatic relations with Cuba."
THU STATE Department im
mediately announced that it was
urging U.S. citizens to consider
leaving Cuba. It also said it would
relay immediate word of the
break to other member nations
of the Organization of American
States (OAS).
The United States was the sev
enth nation to break relations
with the Castro regime, which
came to power two years ago
amid the high hopes of its neigh
bors for the idealistic reforms
promised by Castro.
But the bearded revolutionary
set out on the Communist-style
program of land and industrial
reform, including seizure of Amer
ican-owned property. Castro cli
maxed his romance with the Reds
by accepting Soviet arms aid.
Even as the break in diplomatic
relations was announced here,
Cuban police arrested U.S. Em
bassy Treasurer Stewart H.
Adams on the eve of his sched
uled departure for the United
States along with other American
diplomatic personnel ousted by
Castro.
THERE WAS no immediate in
dication of the charge against
Adams, who was seized in his
home while packing. U.S. Charge
d'Affaires Daniel J. Braddock
promptly contacted the Cuban
