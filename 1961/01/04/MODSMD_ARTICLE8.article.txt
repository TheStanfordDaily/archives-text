### 
BRUSSELS—(UPI) • Mounted
gendarmes charged with bared
sabers yesterday and crushed an
attempted march on parliament
by thousands of leftist rioters.
Violence flared in other Belgian
cities as Socialist-led strikers took
to the streets to de m a n d the
ouster of Catholic Premier Gas
ton Eyskens.
Between 75,000 and 100,000
strikers demonstrated in towns
and cities throughout Belgium in
the showdown phase of the two
week-old leftist strike against
government - proposed austerity
measures.
The leftist show of strength
failed, however, to sway the gov
ernment majority in parliament.
It quickly voted down, by 121 to
83, a Socialist motion demanding
withdrawal of the austerity bill.
The Chambers also rejected by
similar margins two other Social
ist motions—one seeking to cens
ure the government for mobiliz
ing troops against the strike, and
the other attacking the govern
ment's economic policy.
A Communist censure motion
was defeated by 115 votes to 44
with two abstentions. The cham
ber then adjourned until today.
The most serious clashes broke
out in Brussels where some 15,000
cat-calling demonstrators, shout
ing "Eyskens to the gallows,"
surged through the streets.
