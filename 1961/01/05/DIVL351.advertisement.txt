There is a growth of legitimate student political
activity. There are also attempts to discredit it.
Was the students' demonstration against the
House Un-American Activities Committee in San
Francisco legitimate? Are the attempts to discredit
it justifiable? Today there are films and publica
tions representingthe Committee's viewpoint, both
about the demonstrations in San Francisco and
about the question of the Committee's violation of
citizens' rights to freedom of speech, press, and
assembly. To date, few have listened to the reasons
for the demonstrations against the Committee, and
to the students' view of what happened.
A fair judgment requires hearing the students'
side as well as that of the Committee. The Com
mittee continues, and with it the question of the
right and duty of public protest.
The students' side is presented on a record made
of excerpts from recordings of the House Un-
American Activities Committee hearings and dem
onstrations in San Francisco. The Sounds of Pro
test is distributed by Slate", a university political
p ~rty concerned with the protection of civil liberties
ar d civil rights.

There is a growth of legitimate student political
activity. There are also attempts to discredit it.
Was the students' demonstration against the
House Un-American Activities Committee in San
Francisco legitimate? Are the attempts to discredit
it justifiable? Today there are films and publica
tions representingthe Committee's viewpoint, both
about the demonstrations in San Francisco and
about the question of the Committee's violation of
citizens' rights to freedom of speech, press, and
assembly. To date, few have listened to the reasons
for the demonstrations against the Committee, and
to the students' view of what happened.
A fair judgment requires hearing the students'
side as well as that of the Committee. The Com
mittee continues, and with it the question of the
right and duty of public protest.
The students' side is presented on a record made
of excerpts from recordings of the House Un-
American Activities Committee hearings and dem
onstrations in San Francisco. The Sounds of Pro
test is distributed by Slate", a university political
p ~rty concerned with the protection of civil liberties
ar d civil rights.
