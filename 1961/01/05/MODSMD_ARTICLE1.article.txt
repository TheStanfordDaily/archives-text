# Africans Take Deep South Tour
## 
### JEAN EBERHART 
Four African students attend
ing Stanford have returned from
a quiet Christmas trip through
the South convinced that only a
minority of Southerners are op
posed to integration, but that the
majority, fearing personal jeop
ardy, will not oppose segregation.
The four, accompanied by three
white Stanford students and two
San Francisco State College Afri
can students, stayed at Negro col
leges and YMCAs in Little Rock,

New Orleans, Baton Rouge, At
lanta, Montgomery, and Washing
ton, D.C., during the 17-day trip.
THE SEVEN from Stanford
are Lewis Chikwendu and Michael
Ero of Nigeria, James Maina
from Kenya, Fred Savage from
Sierra Leone, and Americans Elon
Gilbert, David Koff and Arthur
Spiegel.
According to Maina, "The
Southern liberal is the South's
only hope, but he is scared of
talking." Maina believes that the
South's main need is people with
prestige who will take a stand for
integration and provide leader
ship. "At the present time," he
said, "the people are just follow
ing anyone blindly."
The tour, suggested by African
students at Stanford as a means
toward furthering their under
standing of American society, was
arranged by the African Desk of
the Institute of International Re
lations.
AMONG the prominent person
alities interviewed by the students
were Gov. Orval Faubus of Ar
kansas; Martin Luther King Jr.;
Lonnie King, student sit-in leafier;
members of the Little Rock school
board, editors of several southern
newspapers, and presidents of
several southern colleges.
Savage was impressed by the
nonviolent response of Negroes
to the leadership of persons such
as the Rev. Martin Luther King.
The Africans found Atlanta to
have more Negro culture and
communication between the races
than other southern cities.
A few southern leaders avoided
answering the Africans' ques
tions. A Montgomery city official
denied that any racial problem
existed in the South. Another gov
ernment leader, when questioned
about segregation, gave the stu
dents information about Russia.
MTTLE ROCK segregationist
Amis Gut bridge first agreed to
talk to the Africans. After phone
calls from several of his follow
ers, Guthridge stated, "I do hot
believe in integrated meetings of
any kind."
White people stopped and
stared when the group of Ameri
cans and Africans appeared to
gether, but Negroes smiled. The
Africans received no rough treat
ment on the trip.

The lIR is sponsoring' a book
drive all day Friday for books to
be sent to African universities
with which Stanford is planning
exchanges. Boxes will lx> in the
dorms and on Engineering Corner
for any non-fiction books. Afri
can students will be at the I-Cen
ter all day Friday.
