# Ike Tells Cuba: Hands Off Guantanamo Bay
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) â€” President Eisenhower yesterday fol
lowed up the diplomatic break with Cuba by warning the Castro
regime to keep hands off the $70 million U.S. naval base at Guan
tanamo Bay.
Castro has threatened the base in the past, but always stopped

short of saying he would try to
get the navy out by force. Ho in
dicated in the United Nations last
September, however, that he
might take the issue to the Inter
national Court in the Hague.
DESPITE the diplomatic break,
State Department Press Officer
Joseph Reap indicated the United
States will try to find some way
to take care of Cuban refugees
seeking admission to this country.
Asked what could be done about
the 52,000 visa applications pend
ing when the U.S. Embassy in
Havana was closed Wednesday
night, Reap said:
"The United States has always
been very generous in opening its
doors to people who are fleeing
from suffering and tyranny."
CONGRESS quickly rallied be
hind both the president's firm
stand on Guantanamo and last
night's break in diplomatic rela
tions. The lawmakers agreed with
Eisenhower that "there is a limit
to what the United States in self
respect can endure."
Chairman J. William Fulbright
of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee said the United States
should be prepared to defend
Guantanamo.
"We should use whatever
means necessary to maintain our
lights," the Arkansas Democrat
said. "We are there by treaty
rights."
AT GUANTANAMO itself, a
base spokesman said, "We are
fully prepared for every eventu
ality . . . whatever happens, we're
going to stay. We are bound by
the directives of the U.S. Navy,
and we're going to follow orders."
Washington's action in break
ing relations was termed "another
step" in the alleged U.S. plan of
armed aggression against Cuba.
Contrasting with Wednesday's
curt note ordering all but 11 mem
bers of the embassy staff to leave
"within 48 hours," the Cuban
foreign office sent a more moder
ate written communication yes
terday advising that the deadline
could be extended if needed.
THE EMBASSY, however, ig
nored the Cuban offer. The multi
million dollar. 10-story embassy
offices will come under Swiss pro
tection when the last embassy of
ficer leaves, probably by the week
end.
Cuban Foreign Minister Raul
Roa, heckled by anti-Castro out
bursts in the gallery, denounced
President Eisenhower who he said
planned an invasion of Cuba.
Roa appealed to President
elect John F. Kennedy to avoid
"an apocalyptic holocaust."
U.S. Ambassador James J.
Wadsworth rejected the Cuban
invasion charges made before the
Security Council as a "midnight
brew, dipped from the cauldron of
hysteria."
"THE UNITED States has noth
ing to hide and nothing to fear
from these charges." Wadsworth
said. "They are false and cannot
stand the light of day. If anybody
has reason to fear a debate on this
question, it is the Cuban leaders
themselves, who have been crying
'wolf!' for the past six months
over an alleged 'imminent inva
sion' of their country and thereby
are fast making themselves ridic
ulous in the eves of the world."
