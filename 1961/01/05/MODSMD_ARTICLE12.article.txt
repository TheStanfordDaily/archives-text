# Hilton Says Break Good For Cuba

### GREGG HOPKINS 
The clumsy handling of the
break in diplomatic relations be
tween Cuba and the United States
may make Fidel Castro appear to
bo "sinned against rather than
the sinner" according to Prof.
Ronald Hilton, director of the His
panic-American Institute.
Castro may gain sup port
throughout Latin America and
with the Cuban middle classes,
with whom his support has been
slipping, Hilton said.
ONLY small, low-prestige Cen
tral American nations—excepting
Peru —have heeded American
pressure to follow suit and break
with Cuba thus far, and others
will do so only reluctantly, if at
all.
The United States action came,
Hilton said, as a result of Cuba's
response to Russian pressure to
require reduction of American
embassy staff size. Ironically, the
United States has applied pres
sure to Latin America nations
recently to require .Russia 1o re
duce the size of its ambassadorial
contingents in Latin capitals to
the size of the American nation's
embassy in Moscow, Hilton point
ed out.
History professor John J. John
son, Latin American history
authority who has just returned
from the East, said he found there
a greater interest and urgency in
dealing with Cuba, probably, he
said, "because they are closer to
Cuba, and have not had such an
awareness of Latin America be
fore as we in the West."
Johnson went on to say that
he would partly attribute the in
volvement of Cuba and other
Latin American countries with
Russia to their desire to improve
their economic and social situa
tions in any way they can, re
gardless of the ideologies con
cerned.
"They have realized that there
is an alternative to representative
democracy, which has been
largely ineffective in Latin Amer
ica,"he said.
THE extreme statements of
Cuban diplomats like UN Minister
Raul Roa can be attributed to an
attempt to keep the revolution in
Cuba alive, said Johnson. "Revo
lutionaries don't care what others
think of their statements, so long
as they accomplish their pur
pose."
Hilton commented that break
ing off of United States relations
with Cuba was probably a threat
that worse could come if Cuba
persisted on her present course.
