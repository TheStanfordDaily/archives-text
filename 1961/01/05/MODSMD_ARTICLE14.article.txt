# Excellent Program
## 
### 
An important segment of a student's education is (lie cultural
program his university offers. Stanford students are indeed fortu
nate that the Committee on Public Exercises offers them the very
best from lectures to music. This quarter the Committee has gath
ered an array of talent which is sure to please everyone.
The Tuesday Evening Series, always excellent in the past, prom
ises to he superh this quarter. Such notables as Robert M. Hutch
ins, Malcolm Cowley and James Bryant Conant will undoubtedly
attract overflow crowds. Vance Packard, who constantly has a book
on the best-seller list, should be well attended even though lliere
is a slight fee.
Music lovers can start their Ircks to Memorial Auditorium this
weekend to hear Enrique Jorda conduct the San Francisco Sym
phony and can make their last trip on March 15 to hear world
renowned violinist Isaac Stern.
Play and film goers also have plenty from which 1o choose.
All in all, there is plenty for everyone and students should make an
attempt to attend these educational and entertaining events.
A word of praise is also extended to the Public Affairs Com
mittee of Political Union for its Focus program. Conceived along
the lines of Yale's famous Challenge concept, Focus is "a program
to confront with realistic concern and responsible action the crucial
issues of today's world.""
The program includes "Higher Education and National Pur
pose" with Dr. llutchins, a panel discussion on "Stanford Univer
sity and National Purpose" and another panel discussion on "The
Hesponsihilitv of the American Press in Politics** which will in
clude Palmer Hoyt, editor of the Denver Post, Senator \\ illiam F.
Know land and Herb Klein of the San Diego Tribune.
The success or failure of Focus depends almost entirely upon
the students. Their participation or lack of it will undoubtedly
determine whether or not Focus will he more than just another
experiment that failed. The Challenge program has captured the
imagination and energy of \ale students and it is hoped that the
Focus program will be fortunate enough to capture the same at
Stanford.
