BY EICHI ISHII
As reported in the newspapers
very often, there have been nu
merous demonstrations in Japan
since last fall. This May, Presi
dent Eisenhower's visit to Japan
was cancelled because of these
demonstrations.
As I feel that the American
newspapers did not provide
enough information and that the
lack of information is causing
misunderstanding between the
United States and Japan, I shall
try to explain the exact situation
in Japan.
At first, the purpose of the dem
onstrations was to oppose the re
vision of the Security Treaty be
tween Japan and the United
States. In the former Security
Treaty, Japan was not supposed
to have any military forces, and
the military bases were occupied
by U.S. troops. But according to
the new Security Pact, Japan is
expected to strengthen its mili
tary forces, in addition to keeping
the U.S. troops in Japan.
Why do some Japanese people
oppose this revision of the Secur
ity Pact? Those who are against
the Security Pact understand that
the present world situation has
come to the point where total dis
armament should be realized.
The demonstrators feel that the
U.S. and the Soviet Union prob
ably have enough nuclear weap
ons to destroy the world if a third
World War should ever take
place.
They believe that in recent
years, even the Soviet Union has
come to realize that it must avoid
a third World War and that the
ideological struggle between Com
munism and Capitalism will be
solved in economic competition.
At this moment in world his
tory, more of the Japanese peo
ple want disarmament and there

fore oppose the development of
the Japanese military forces.
There were two major objec
tions among the demonstrators
against the treaty.
The first opposes the existence
of the Security Treaty itseLf. The
demonstrators are not only
against developing the Japanese
defense forces but also against
having American military bases
in Japan.
They believe Communist China
will never attack Japan since the
attack on Japan may cause the
third World War which would de
stroy Communist China itself.
The demonstrators contention is
that only diplomacy which stands
on trust can lead us to total dis
armament. Japan is a nation
which can take the first step and
which can lead all other countries
to disarmament.
The other objection to the new
treaty is that although Japan
should not develop its military
forces, it might be too early to
realize complete disarmament.
Japan should be protected by
American troops since Communist
China is an aggressive country.
This second group is the majority
of the people as far as I can esti
mate.
Then why did the students riot
as reported in the papers and on
the radio? There were several
riots caused by a group of stu
dents called "Zengakuren." This
group tried to move into the Diet
House but they did not intend to
fight with the police force.
These students believe in ideo
logical Communism, but have no !
connection with any Communist j
Party, not of the type represented
in Communist China, the Soviet
Union, or Communist parties as
reported here in the United States.
The reasons for such radical
movement are, first, to call to the
attention of the Japanese people
the problems of the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty, and, second, to
create an atmosphere of revolu-1
tion. I'd like to stress here that |
the majority of the demonstrators
were not Communists, and did not
riot.
