## 
### 
BRUSSELS (UPI) — Police
broke up a march on Parliament
yesterday by 300 demonstrators
while Socialist deputies demanded
the resignation of Premier Gaston
Eyskens.
The clash between police and
demonstrators erupted at the end
of still another march by 10,000
strikers who swept through the
center of Brussels shouting "Eys
kens to the gallows," smashing
windows and hurling firecrackers
at mounted police.
Yesterday's uproarious Parlia
ment" session took place behind
the protection of hundreds of
paratroopers and gendarmes who
brought up tanks, armored cars,
trucks and erected barbed wire
barricades in fear of a march on
Brussels by Socialist-led strikers.
The session was marked by fist
shaking at Eyskens and demands
for new elections; desk banging
by angry deputies; fierce personal
attacks on the premier and Social
ist criticism of the government
for spending too much money on
palaces for King Baudouin and
other members of the royal
family.
Police announced that a man
was killed Tuesday night when
his motorcycle crashed into a tree

placed across a road as a barrier.
His death brought to three the
fatality toll in the current crisis.
Police also announced that at
least three rioters were arrested
in Brussels yesterday and 60 more
throughout the provinces to bring
the total jailed since the begin
ning of the crisis to more than
200. Ten were arrested at Arlon
when the government took over
a strike-bound gas works.
The government claimed a
gradual drift back to work but
said this was hampered by picket
ing. electricity, shortages and
roadblocks set up by strikers. So
cialist headquarters claimed the
strike front by 500,000 to 600,000
workers remained solid.
The Socialist-led unions ap
pealed to Brussels department
store workers yesterday to join
the strike but only about 20 to 30
per cent of workers were absent
and all big Brussels stores re
mained open as usual.

The government claimed a
gradual drift back to work but
said this was hampered by picket
ing. electricity, shortages and
roadblocks set up by strikers. So
cialist headquarters claimed the
strike front by 500,000 to 600,000
workers remained solid.
The Socialist-led unions ap
pealed to Brussels department
store workers yesterday to join
the strike but only about 20 to 30
per cent of workers were absent
and all big Brussels stores re
mained open as usual.
