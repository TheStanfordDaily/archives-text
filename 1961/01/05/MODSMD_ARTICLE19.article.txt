WASHINGTON (UPI) — Son-]
ate Democratic Leader Mike'
Mansfield won a compromise vic
tory yesterday in his demand for
(he right to fill vacancies on the I
Policy Committee. He may go i
ahead provided his party col-!
leagues confirm his choices.
Senate Democrats agreed on the '
plan at a caucus during which
they also voted unanimously to j
make both the Policy and Steer-1
ing Committees "as representa-!
live as possible of the geographic
and philosophical views" of the
party's 65 Senate members.
Mansfield, who had threatened
to quit his newly-won leadership
post if denied the appointive
power, claimed the compromise
agreement was no different from
previous systems. Senators al

ways have had the right to make
nominations from ihe floor after
the party leader has made ap
pointments, lie said.
Mansfield's view was disputed,
however, by Sen. Albert Core, D-
Tenn., who had offered a proposal
to elect Policy and Steering Com
mittee members.
Core said the change in proced
ure represented a "gain" for those
who feel thai all Ihe party's Sen
ators should have the right to re
view Ihe actions of its leadership.
lie said, for example, that the
Democratic membership did not
know until yesterday's meeting
that the policy seat vacated by re
tiring Sen. Theodore Francis
Green, D-R.1., had been awarded
last summer to Sen. John O. Pas
tore. D-R.I.
