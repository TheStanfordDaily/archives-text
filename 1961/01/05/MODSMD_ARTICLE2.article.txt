# Crimson, Cardinal in Hot Debate

### 
Harvard University's top-ranked j
debate team clashed with Stan
ford yesterday over a resolution j
calling for the United States to
adopt a program of compulsory
health insurance for all citizens.
Stanford's leading team of Bob
Sayler and Bob Best argued the
affirmative case before a capac
ity audience in the Little Theater
while Gene Clements and Larry
Tribe of Harvard took the nega

ACCORDING to prearranged
plans, no decision was awarded, j
However, the two teams may |
meet again this month at the In-j
tereollegiate Tournament in Red- j

Stanford's team began the con

Sayler claimed that the cost of
medical care has increased alarm-1

and physically impaired are un- j
able either to pay for or to obtain |
by other means adequate medical j
care.
HE POINTED out that most 1
health insurance does not cover |
mental illness, and that compul-j
sory health insurance could rem- j
edy that situation. He also said I
that compulsory insurance would j
cut down the present trend to- j
ward socialized medicine.
Larry Tribe, the first negative !
speaker, slashed back contending
that the need for compulsory i
health insurance is nonexistent. I
Quoting from an article in the I
Wall Street Journal, he said that
80 per cent of the people over 65
have adequate health insurance.
The indigent. Tribe went on to j
say, can awlays obtain medical
care from a government hospital
if they are sick enough to need
it and want it. He claimed that â– 
enough people in the U.S. have ;
comprehensive health insurance, i
