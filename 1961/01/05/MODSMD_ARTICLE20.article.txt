# Indians Boast Third Best Defense in Nations; Windsor Leads Stanford Basketball Statistics
## 
### 
I John Windsor lead the Stanford
basketball team in scoring after
I the first month of the season with
i a 15-point per game average. De
; spile Windsor's efforts, the Stan-
I ford team as a whole has been
able to average only a little over
50 points a game.
Windsor not only leads Stan
ford in scoring, but he also has
the most field goals attempted,
125; and made, 50; most rebounds,
IS per game; best shooting per
centage, 10 pel 1 cent; most free
throws attempted, 41; mo-st free
throws made, 25.

made, points, scoring average,
7.25, and loads in assists vvilh 1!).
John Hendry is the team leader
in free throw percentage with 73
per cent, while Mike Lodgerwood
leads in fouls, 30, and is the sec
j one! leading rebounder.
As a team, Stanford is third in
the nation in defense, allowing a
mere 53 points a game, bul un
fortunately the offense has only
been able to score 50.1 points a
I game.
TIIKRE IS ONE revealing sta
tistic that tells the story of Stan
j ford basketball this year, and that
i is the percentage of field goals
| made.
Stanford has attempted 468
field goals as opposed to their op
ponents' 361, but only leads 154-
! 143 in field goals made. That's
j 107 more shots taken than the
opposing team, but only 11 more
! field goals. That adds up to good
j rebounding, but only average
| shooting.
At ihe Los Angeles Basketball
j Tournament, in games against In
diana, Michigan State and Cali
fornia. the Indians made only
19 per cent of all field goal tries.
AGAINST THE University of
i San Francisco Stanford did equal
| ly poorly, making only 10 of 53
•shots, also 19 per cent.
Another Stanford trouble has
j been difficulty in holding a sec
ond half lead. Against St. Mary's,
j USF. Santa Clara and California,
Stanford held a lead with only 10
i minutes left in the game, only to

Sco the load go down the drain as
tbo opponents oamo on to win.
This was particularly apparent
against Cal. Stanford lead 31-24
with eight minutes remaining.
Cal came on strong to forge into
the lead with two minutes left on
the clock and won, 40-36.


WHO'S CONFUSED?—Don and Doug Clemetson (who appear above in roughly that order)
seem to be causing each other the problem that usually occurs to outsiders, one of recogni
tion. At any rate, the sophomore guards have been causing Stanford opponents double trou
ble with their deft ball handling and shooting. Both have amazing poise for first-year players
and surprise veteran observers by seldom making mistakes.

Stanford has attempted 468
field goals as opposed to their op

At ihe Los Angeles Basketball

AGAINST THE University of

Another Stanford trouble has
j been difficulty in holding a sec

Stanford held a lead with only 10
i minutes left in the game, only to

Sco the load go down the drain as

This was particularly apparent
against Cal. Stanford lead 31-24
with eight minutes remaining.
Cal came on strong to forge into
the lead with two minutes left on
the clock and won, 40-36.


WHO'S CONFUSED?—Don and Doug Clemetson (who appear above in roughly that order)
seem to be causing each other the problem that usually occurs to outsiders, one of recogni
tion. At any rate, the sophomore guards have been causing Stanford opponents double trou
ble with their deft ball handling and shooting. Both have amazing poise for first-year players
and surprise veteran observers by seldom making mistakes.
