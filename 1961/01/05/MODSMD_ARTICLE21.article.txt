# Curtice Steps Up Grid Recruiting

### 
Stanford football Coach Jack
Curtice is putting a high level re
cruiting program into effect
which is designed to bring some
badly needed football players to
the Farm.
Curtice and his staff are pres
ently out beating the high school
bushes up and down the Coast
and in various other parts of Ihe
country. The process consists of
luncheons, dinners and meetings
as often as three times a day with
up to 25 or 50 high school coaches
and scouts.
'nil-: SCOUTS usually are of
the part-time, unpaid variety and
are almost exclusively Stanford
alumni bent (in improving their
alma mater's football fortunes.
Since Curtice came to Stanford
in 1958 his recruiting program has
been paying off, at least in the
number of football players receiv
ing financial aid who end up here.
In 1958. for instance, only nine
freshmen who had been actively
recruited came to Stanford. The
rest of the frosh football team
was made up of players who just
turned out for football.
IN' 1959 the number of sought
after players that came to Stan
ford was 1 1 and last year it was
31. Last year's frosh squad won
one game, lost one and tied two
against stiff competition and sev
eral players look ready to step up
to t lie varsity ranks.
Assistant Coach Leon Mc-
Laughlin has charge of Ihe
coaching staff's immense filing
system by which fabs are kepi on
most of the nation's top prep
players.
"We have a regular routine that
we go through." McLaughlin said.
"First we have lo find out where
the players are. Our primary
sources for this information are
high school coaches. All-league
team - are helpful too, especially
when they are marie up by the
coaches.
"SOMKTI.MKS we look at mov
ies of the player, if they're avail
able. and make our own decision."
McLaughlin says that the next
step is finding out if the player
has the grades to come to Stan
ford "If the coach says the player
has Ihe grades we ask him to send
uj his transcript. Then we show
ii lo the admissions office and
lhoy tell us whether it's worth it
for him lo apply."
The next step consists of selling
1 ho player on Stanford. This may
take the form of bringing him to
campus and having him spend a
few days looking around. Inter
views can be arranged with a pro
fessor in his major field or with
Iho admissions office.
"\\ l\ USUALLY have him talk
to some of Ihe athletes here,"
McLaughlin said. "Also if there
aio anv Olivers here from his

I home town or high school wo
have them Iry to sell him on
Stanford.

"We find that if a boy wants a
good education, we usually get
him."
