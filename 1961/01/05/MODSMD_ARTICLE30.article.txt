NED FUTTY"
Chloe McFeeters was ;t beautiful coed who majored in psychol
ogy and worked in the I.(). testing department of the University.
She worked there because she loved and admired intelligence
a hove a 11 things. "I love and admire intelligence a hove all thing-"
is the way she put it.
Ned I'utty. on the other hand, was a man who could take
intelligence i >r leave it alone. What he loved and admired a hove
all things was girls. "What I love and admire ahove all things
is girls'' is the way he put it.
()ne day Xed saw Chloe on campus and was instantly smitten.
''Excuse me, miss," he said, tugging at his forelock. "Will you
marrv me?"
She looked at his duck-tail haircut, his black-rimmed glasses,
his two-day heard, his grimy T-shirt, his tattered jeans, his de
composing tennis shoes. "Yon are not unattractive," she ad
mitted. "hut for me beauty is not enough. Intelligence is what
I'm looking for. Come to the l.Q. testing department with inc."

"Of course, my tiger," cried Ned and {riirjiled :md smote his
11 ii*rl i and hit Chloe's im j>e and scr.mpered goat like alter her
to the I.Q. testing department.
'"First, I will test your vocabulary," said Chloe.
"He my guest," laughed Ned and licked her pulm.
''What docs juxtaposition mean?"
" Meats me," he confessed cheerfully and nil>bled her knuckles.
"How about ineffable?"
"Never heard of it," guffawed Ned, plunging his face into
her clavicle.
"Furtive?"
"With fur on?" said Ned doubtfully.
"Oh, Ned Futty," said Chloe, "you are dumb, Consequently
1 cannot be your girl because I love and admire intelligence
above all things."
He flung himself on the floor and clasped her ankles. "Hut I
love you," lie cried in anguish. "Do not send me from you or
you will make the world a sunless place, full of dim and
fearful shapes."
"Go," she said coldly.
Lorn and mute, he made his painful way to the door. There
he stopped and lit a cigarette. Then he opened the dool' and
started away to his gray and grisly future.
"Stay!" called Chloe.
1 le turned.
"Was that," she asked, "a Marlboro you just lit?"
"Yes," he said.
" Then come to me and be my love," cried Chloe joyously.
"You arc not dumb. You are smart! Anybody is smart to smoke
Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltcred taste which
comes to you in soft pack or flip-top box at prices all can afford
at tobacco counters, drugstores, groceries, restaurants and
trampoline courts all over America. Ned, lover, give me a
Marlboro and marry me."
And they smoked happily ever after,

"Yes," he said.
" Then come to me and be my love," cried Chloe joyously.
"You arc not dumb. You are smart! Anybody is smart to smoke
Marlboro, the filter cigarette with the unfiltcred taste which
