# Policies Changed For Bookstore
## 
### 
Two changes in bookstore pro
cedures have been made for pres
ent and future use. Because of stu
dents' confusion concerning re
quired and recommended books,
required books now have white
or buff tags while recommended
books have pink tags.
In order to notify students
about books coming in late, there
will now be posted outside the
bookstore a list stating newly re
ceived late books.
