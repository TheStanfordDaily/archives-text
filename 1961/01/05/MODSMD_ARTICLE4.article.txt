# Small Audience Hears Debate On Dictators
## 
### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
Speaking for the affirmative
in the Political Union's debate on
Dictatorship and Foreign Policy,
Richard Noble contended last
night that "dictatorship may be
the key to survival in some chao
tic countries of the world."
Ken Purcell countered before a
small audience in the Women's
Clubhouse for the negative by
arguing that "support of a dicta
torship alienates the people who
will eventually gain control of
the country."
"Different people in different
circumstances require different
governments," Noble stated.
THERE SHOULD be no divorce
between political theory and fact,
and we must realize that in some
countries there are substantial
obstacles to democracy, Noble
brought out. The notion that all
dictatorships are oppressive has
to be disregarded.
In refuting Noble's argument,
Purcell first sought to define
valid foreign policy as effectively
and efficiently supporting the
United States' goals of strength
ening the free world and achiev
ing peace. The dominant condi
tion of the world today is transi
tion in which the common people
are attempting to gain the reins,
Purcell explained.
A COMMON mistake, Purcell
pointed out is assuming that dic
tators will remain in power, while
they inevitably will be over
thrown. So by "seeking transi
tory stability" (by supporting a
dictatorshipi we are alienating
those who will rule later. Purcell
filled out his argument by making
two more points. We may give
the confusing impression to other
peoples that we don't believe
wholly in democracy if we clutch
at dictatorships that support us.
If we do support dictatorships we
are supporting a political system
alien to us, he concluded.
