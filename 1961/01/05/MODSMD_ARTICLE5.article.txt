# Craig Joins History Department
## 
### 
One of the nation's most emi
nent scholars in the field of mod
ern German history and contem
porary European diplomacy, Prof.
Gordon A. Craig of Princeton, has
been appointed to Stanford's his
tory faculty .
He is the second noted historian
recently to join the Stanford fac
ulty. Prof. David M. Potter of
Yale was appointed Coe professor
of history in August.
CRAIG, educated at Princeton,
has been on the faculty there
since 1941. He has been a profes
sor since 1950. Student polls have
rated him Princeton's most suc
cessful teacher.
Leaving with "great regrets,"
Craig explained that "Even
though working at Stanford may
be no more exciting than at
Princeton, I would like to take
one last fling at something differ
ent." He noted that the Stanford
history department is "interesting
and growing."
Here he will concentrate on his
original specialty, the history of
modern Germany, in which he will
make use of the excellent collec
tions which (he Hoover Memorial
Library has in this field.
PROFESSOR Craig made it
clear that his transfer was not
based on the "extras" of position
or salary, nor upon any disagree
ment with the Princeton History
Department. "After 30 years of
connection with Princeton," he
said, "it is of course not easy to
leave, and Iwould certainly plan
ro maintain contact with the uni
versity."
Craig won a Rhodes scholarship
to Oxford in 1936. He spent the
19.16-57 academic year as a fellow
at the Center for Advance Study
in the Behavioral Sciences at
Stanford.
Craig will join the Stanford fac
ulty beginning with the summer
quarter.
