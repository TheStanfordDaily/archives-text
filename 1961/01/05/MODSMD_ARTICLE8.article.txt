# Capitalism, U.S. Slavery Doom Told
## 
### JUDY SEABORG 
The United States of America,
contended Socialist Labor Party
leader Eric Haas last night before
a standing-room only audience in
Cubberley Auditorium, is a "na
tion of paupers" submerged in
"economic slavery. They have no
tools, and no influence in determ
ining the economic policies to
which they must submit."
Haas, editor of the SLP's news
paper, the Weekly People, and
three-time candidate for president
of the United States on the SLP
ticket, described the plight of the
American worker who "suffers in
the midst of plenty."
THIS contradiction, he said, is
the basic contradiction of the cap
italistic system and the one which
has "fatally" foredoomed it: those
people who work for a living re
ceive a price for their labor which
amounts to only a fraction of
their product; therefore, they can
only buy back a fraction of what
they produce." This, he said, ac
counts for the surpluses in this
"era of human madness."
The Socialist Labor Party,
stated Haas, is "not interested in
reforming capitalism. This would
bo as useless as to wash garbage
before you throw it in the can."
He also said that the SLP is not
the same as the Socialist Party,
the Socialist Workers or Trotsky
ist Party, or the Communist
Party. These are reformers, the
SLP revolutionists.
Haas described his ideal social
ist government, which would have
"ih<> administrative organization
under the working people and not
bureaucracy." This would rule out
state control as a form of social
ism. because the "material inter
ests of politicians are in conflict
with the interests of the great
mass of people. The skill of the
politician is to make it appear
that what he does for one class
benefits all the people."
THE NEW government would
be an Industrial Union Govern
ment with a democracy based on
industrial units.
