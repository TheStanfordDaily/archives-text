until he made this statement)
Help finish the job! Read all the books
(especially paperbacks) required or recom-
I mended—as you fulfill the Winter Quarter
requirements of the education that will
make you a National Resource in the Cold
War.
Even if you aren't a physics or math major,
and hence won't easily fit into Lockheed's
or GE's electronics space-production line,
don't hang your head. Perhaps training in
the humanities will handicap you a bit, but
you can always hope to become a "psycho
logical warrior," or a public relations offi
cer for the AEC. With the proper talent
and voice training, you may even be able to
sell "the thinking man's cigarette.
So read the books! And help line Kepler's pockets at the
same time by buying them at:
