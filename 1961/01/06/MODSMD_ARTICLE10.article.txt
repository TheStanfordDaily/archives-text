# Sterling's Annual Talk To Start ST&T Week
## 
### 
President Wallace Sterling will open the ninth annual Stan
lord Today and Tomorrow program Tuesday with his yearly
address to the students.
Set for Memorial Auditorium at II a.m., Sterling's talk will
present the challenges Stanford faces in the next 10 years and
the University's role as a national force, according to ST&T chair
man Bob Sayler.
Sterling will tell of education as an international movement,
referring to his just-completed three-month world tour, Sayler
added.
Classes will be dismissed for this event, which begins ST&T
week. Over thirty living groups will sponsor discussions, begin
ning that evening and continuing Thursday and Tuesday
Jan. 17.
The discussions will feature prominent members of the fac
ulty and the administration, who will answer questions posed
by students concerning University operation and policy, now and
in the future.
Other questions which will probably be covered are the
issue of liquor on campus, foreign study programs, the quarter
system vs. the semester system, the new student union, and re
cent honor code violations. The speakers will give their views on
these matters, and then discuss them informally with the
students.
Speakers will be at each of the freshman houses, and two
fraternities Tuesday evening. On Thursday, other speakers will
address combined groups of fraternities and upperclass women's
dorms, and on the following Tuesday, the eating clubs.
