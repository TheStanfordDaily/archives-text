### 
BRUSSELS (UPI) — King Baudouin's personal intervention to
end Belgium's worst postwar strike crisis was reported succeeding
last night.
Reports swept through Parliament that the king had put forth
the idea of a cabinet of "national unity" which would bring the So-

cialist opposition party into the
govcrnemnt and end the 18 days
of strikes which have crippled
the country.
THERE WAS speculation that
Socialist Paul-Henri Spaak, a
former premier who has been
NATO Secretary - G e ner a 1 for
nearly four years, might be asked
to head such a government. But in
Paris NATO sources said he had
not been approached yet.
Strike leaders appeared to be
wavering and the government
claimed more and more workers
were returning to their jobs.
The Brussels section of the So
cialist-led Belgian Trades Union
Federation asked the National
Bureau to call for a nationwide
general strike and to organize a
much talked about "march on
Brussles" by workers from
throughout the country.
THE NATIONAL Bureau took
no action.
There was a relative lull in the
demonstrations and rioting which
marked the conflict from the out
set.
About 2,000 strikers marched
toward Brussels City Hall to pie
sent a petition to Burgomaster
Lucian Cooremans. They were
turned back by strong police and
gendarme cordons backed by
armored cars and water cannon
at approaches to the historic
Grand Palace.
LATER 500 persons staged a
brief sit-down strike on street car
tracks on the Boulevard Dan
spach. Finally they marched back
to Socialist Party Headquarters
without any serious clashes with
police. Half a dozen youths were
arrested.
