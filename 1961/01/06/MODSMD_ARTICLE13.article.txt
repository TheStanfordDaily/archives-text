# Laotian Loyalists Score New Gains as Red Planes Evacuate Rebel Troops
## Loyal Troops Battle Invaders Near Border 
### 
VIENTIANE, Laos, Jan. 5
(UPIi The pro-western Laotian
government reported yesterday it
has defeated Communist forces
around Xieng Khouang and that
Soviet transport planes are evac
uating Communist North Viet
minh troops from airfields near
the City.
Information Minister Bouavang
Norasing said loyal troops are
battling other invading Vietminh
and Communist Pat hot Lao
troops near the border of Com
munist North Viet Nam. He said
the Laotian army is fighting well
and has seized the offensive in
several places.
(A BROADCAST by the Com
munist Pathet Lao Radio said
rebel forces have driven to the
outer defenses of the royal capital
of Luang Prabang and are en
gaged in "hitter fighting" with
defending royal troops. It said a
battalion of Red Laotian guerril
las has joined them.)
Bouavang said the North Viet
Nam troops being flown out of
Xieng Khouang apparently had
been parachuted into Van Vicng
late last month and marched to
Xieng Khouang with other rebel
forces.
"Now they are leaving to pre
vent us from proving foreign in
tervention." he said.
(IN BANGKOK, the newspaper
Bangkok Post quoted Laotion
Public Works Minister Khampan
Panya in an interview as saying
Laos will break off relations with
the Soviet Union if the Soviets
continue to air drop military sup
plies to the rebels.)
Bouavang gave few details of
the fighting around Xieng Khou
ang where a see-saw battle has
raged for days but said "The situ
ation is now in our hands."
Xieng Khouang is important
because of the airfield complex
around it and because it is the
key to the "Plain of Jars," tho
grassy plateau which controls the
approaches to the borders of
Thailand and Cambodia.
BOUAVANG said Communist
Vietminh troops had engaged La
otian defenders Tuesday night at
Pak Ha, near the border town of
Nong Het, on the Viet Nam bor
der some 40 miles northeast of
Xieng Khouang. He said loyal
troops control the mountain
heights around the town and are
fighting bitterly for the town it
self.
