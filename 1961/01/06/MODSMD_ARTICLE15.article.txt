# A 						Smart Move?

Professor Ronald Hilton, director of the Hispanic-American
Institute, said in a Daily article yesterday that the clumsy hand
ling of the break in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the
United States may make Fidel Castro appear to be "sinned against
rather than the sinner."
This is verv true and leads one to wonder whether our action
was not a little impetuous. Certainly the U.S. had to do something
about Cuba's demand to limit our embassy to eleven people, but
it is doubtful that we had to go so far.
We could have skilfully countered by cutting down the num
ber of people in the Cuban Embassy. In this way, we would have
put Cuba in the position of making the next move. If ("astro would
have removed our entire embassy, then Cuba would have been put
in a bad light.
Severance of diplomatic relations with a country is considered
one step short of a declaration of war. It is therefore not surpris
ing that Castro and his cohorts are claiming that the U.S. is plan
ning to attack Cuba. Our denial of this will not help to qualm the
growing fears of the Cuban people and will only strengthen Cas
tro's position.
Our recent warning to Castro to keep his hands off Guanta
namo Bay sounds a little bit ridiculous. A treaty signed in the
early part of this century when the Cubans were our friends does
not necessarily have to be recognized by a Cuba which now con
siders us her enemy. Secondly, Guantanamo Bay's military impor
tance is questionable. It is likely to be more trouble than it. is
worth.
There is no denying that Cuba's continual attempts to harrass
and embarrass the United States had to lead to some reprisal, but
it seems that our move has not immediately improved our position
in Latin America nor can it likely help in the future.
As Professor Ililton points out, only small, unimportant coun
tries have followed the United States' maneuver and countries will
only break diplomatic relations rather reluctantly with Cuba in the
future. At this point, it is difficult to see what we have gained from
our break, but easy to see that we cotdd lose a lot more than we
can possibly gain.
