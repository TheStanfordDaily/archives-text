In each House of Congress
there are formidable obstacles to
the rule of simple majorities, and
the question is how far these ob
stacles are to be reduced or re
moved. But the problem in the
House is different from the prob
lem in the Senate, and the differ
ence involves an important dif
ference of principle, and indeed of
the spirit and the intent of the
constitution itself.
The problem in the House of
Representatives does not, as it
does in the case of the Senate,
arise from the power of a minor
ity to prevent legislation by a fili
buster. The House does not have
unlimited debate. The problem
there arises from the fact that
the Rules Committee has almost
absolute power of life and death
over bills before they can be voted
upon. There may be a majority in
favor of a bill. Unless the Rules
Committee permit it, the major
ity cannot bring the bill to a vote.
In recent years the Rules Com
mittee has had twelve members —
eight of them Democrats and four
of them Republicans. But two of
the Democrats, Howard YV. Smith
of Virginia and William M. Col
mer of Mississippi, have formed
an alliance with the four Repub
licans, thus dividing the Commit
tee six to six. This prevents it
from acting affirmatively, and
enables the conservative coalition
to block not only civil rights leg
islation luit all manner of so-called
progressive legislation.
It is impossible, I think, to de
fend this arrangement on the
ground of principle. For the
House of Representatives repre
sents the people of the United
States and its spirit is that there
the simple numerical majority
shall prevail. The bi-partisan deal
in the Rules Committee is in fact
a usurpation of power, depriving
the majority of its rights, and
thwarting the will of the people.
The House can, and we may hope
that the House will, break up the
deal and recover the right of ma
jority rule.
The problem of the Senate, on
the other hand, involves ques
tions of high constitutional prin
ciple. The crux of the question is
nol whether the majority should
rule but what kind of majority
should rule. Shall it be a simple
numerical majority of the Sen
ators present and voting? Shall it
be two-thirds of all the Senators
elected? Or shall it be something

I between the two?
Here lies the crux of the argu
ment. What kind of majority shall
have the right to end debate in
the Senate, and therefore to bring
about a vote? The kind of ma
jority that has the power to do
this has the power to legislate.
The recognition that there may
bo various kinds of majorities is
deeply imbedded in the constitu
tion Simple majority rule—one
more than half of a quorum—is
by no means the general principle
of the constitution. Constitutional
amendments, the expulsion of
members, the over-riding of the
president's veto, require two
thirds of all the Senators elected.
Treaties and impeachments re
quire two-thirds of those present
and voting. Why these variations?
Because these are questions which
involve the whole nation, it may
be for war, the constitution re
quires that such grave decisions
shall have a large not merely a
simple majority.
Iu my view it is important, in
deed vital to our liberties, to pre
serve the principle that for great
; issues, for isues that affect deeply
great regions or sections of the
nation, there should be required
more than a simple majority. For
we must never forget that major
ities are not always liberal and
that they may be quite tyrannical.
It is, I have always thought, a
short view of history to equate
simple majority rule with the de
fense of the civil rights of Ne
groes. The civil rights of all Amer
icans will be safer if within the
Senate, which represents the Fed
eral principle, we do not give ab
solute power to simple majorities.
The practical conclusion which
I draw from this is that the ques
tion of cloture in the Senate is
not one of this or that but of more
01 less. Between the two extremes
of a simple majority of a quorum
and of a two-thirds majority of
jail the Senators elected, there is
j plenty of room for compromise.
The proper point at which to
make the compromise is where
moderate Southerners like Lyn
don Johnson and Sam Rayburn
can live with the solution, and
feel that they are not being dra
gooned and over-ridden. For noth
ing good can be done by persua
sion and education if the moder
ates in the South feel that they
are coerced.

simple majority rule with the de
fense of the civil rights of Ne
groes. The civil rights of all Amer
icans will be safer if within the
Senate, which represents the Fed
eral principle, we do not give ab
solute power to simple majorities.
The practical conclusion which
I draw from this is that the ques
tion of cloture in the Senate is
not one of this or that but of more
01 less. Between the two extremes
of a simple majority of a quorum
and of a two-thirds majority of
jail the Senators elected, there is
j plenty of room for compromise.
The proper point at which to
make the compromise is where
moderate Southerners like Lyn
don Johnson and Sam Rayburn
can live with the solution, and
feel that they are not being dra
gooned and over-ridden. For noth
ing good can be done by persua
sion and education if the moder
ates in the South feel that they
are coerced.

In each House of Congress
there are formidable obstacles to
the rule of simple majorities, and
the question is how far these ob
stacles are to be reduced or re
moved. But the problem in the
House is different from the prob
lem in the Senate, and the differ
ence involves an important dif
ference of principle, and indeed of
the spirit and the intent of the
constitution itself.
The problem in the House of
Representatives does not, as it
does in the case of the Senate,
arise from the power of a minor
ity to prevent legislation by a fili
buster. The House does not have
unlimited debate. The problem
there arises from the fact that
the Rules Committee has almost
absolute power of life and death
over bills before they can be voted
upon. There may be a majority in
favor of a bill. Unless the Rules
Committee permit it, the major
ity cannot bring the bill to a vote.
In recent years the Rules Com
mittee has had twelve members —
eight of them Democrats and four
of them Republicans. But two of
the Democrats, Howard YV. Smith
of Virginia and William M. Col
mer of Mississippi, have formed
an alliance with the four Repub
licans, thus dividing the Commit
tee six to six. This prevents it
from acting affirmatively, and
enables the conservative coalition
to block not only civil rights leg
islation luit all manner of so-called
progressive legislation.
It is impossible, I think, to de
fend this arrangement on the
ground of principle. For the
House of Representatives repre
sents the people of the United
States and its spirit is that there
the simple numerical majority
shall prevail. The bi-partisan deal
in the Rules Committee is in fact
a usurpation of power, depriving
the majority of its rights, and
thwarting the will of the people.
The House can, and we may hope
that the House will, break up the
deal and recover the right of ma
jority rule.
The problem of the Senate, on
the other hand, involves ques
tions of high constitutional prin
ciple. The crux of the question is
nol whether the majority should
rule but what kind of majority
should rule. Shall it be a simple
numerical majority of the Sen
ators present and voting? Shall it
be two-thirds of all the Senators
elected? Or shall it be something

I between the two?
Here lies the crux of the argu
ment. What kind of majority shall
have the right to end debate in
the Senate, and therefore to bring
about a vote? The kind of ma
jority that has the power to do
this has the power to legislate.
The recognition that there may
bo various kinds of majorities is
deeply imbedded in the constitu
tion Simple majority rule—one
more than half of a quorum—is
by no means the general principle
of the constitution. Constitutional
amendments, the expulsion of
members, the over-riding of the
president's veto, require two
thirds of all the Senators elected.
Treaties and impeachments re
quire two-thirds of those present
and voting. Why these variations?
Because these are questions which
involve the whole nation, it may
be for war, the constitution re
quires that such grave decisions
shall have a large not merely a
simple majority.
Iu my view it is important, in
deed vital to our liberties, to pre
serve the principle that for great
; issues, for isues that affect deeply
great regions or sections of the
nation, there should be required
more than a simple majority. For
we must never forget that major
ities are not always liberal and
that they may be quite tyrannical.
It is, I have always thought, a
short view of history to equate

bo various kinds of majorities is
deeply imbedded in the constitu
tion Simple majority rule—one
more than half of a quorum—is
by no means the general principle
of the constitution. Constitutional
amendments, the expulsion of
members, the over-riding of the
president's veto, require two
thirds of all the Senators elected.
Treaties and impeachments re
quire two-thirds of those present
and voting. Why these variations?
Because these are questions which
involve the whole nation, it may
be for war, the constitution re
quires that such grave decisions
shall have a large not merely a
simple majority.
Iu my view it is important, in
deed vital to our liberties, to pre
serve the principle that for great
; issues, for isues that affect deeply
great regions or sections of the
nation, there should be required
more than a simple majority. For
we must never forget that major
ities are not always liberal and
that they may be quite tyrannical.
It is, I have always thought, a
short view of history to equate
simple majority rule with the de
fense of the civil rights of Ne
groes. The civil rights of all Amer
icans will be safer if within the
Senate, which represents the Fed
eral principle, we do not give ab
solute power to simple majorities.
The practical conclusion which
I draw from this is that the ques
tion of cloture in the Senate is
not one of this or that but of more
01 less. Between the two extremes
of a simple majority of a quorum
and of a two-thirds majority of
jail the Senators elected, there is
j plenty of room for compromise.
The proper point at which to
make the compromise is where
moderate Southerners like Lyn
don Johnson and Sam Rayburn
can live with the solution, and
feel that they are not being dra
gooned and over-ridden. For noth
ing good can be done by persua
sion and education if the moder
ates in the South feel that they
are coerced.

In each House of Congress
there are formidable obstacles to
the rule of simple majorities, and
the question is how far these ob
stacles are to be reduced or re
moved. But the problem in the
House is different from the prob
lem in the Senate, and the differ
ence involves an important dif
ference of principle, and indeed of
the spirit and the intent of the
constitution itself.
The problem in the House of
Representatives does not, as it
does in the case of the Senate,
arise from the power of a minor
ity to prevent legislation by a fili
buster. The House does not have
unlimited debate. The problem
there arises from the fact that
the Rules Committee has almost
absolute power of life and death
over bills before they can be voted
upon. There may be a majority in
favor of a bill. Unless the Rules
Committee permit it, the major
ity cannot bring the bill to a vote.
In recent years the Rules Com
mittee has had twelve members —
eight of them Democrats and four
of them Republicans. But two of
the Democrats, Howard YV. Smith
of Virginia and William M. Col
mer of Mississippi, have formed
an alliance with the four Repub
licans, thus dividing the Commit
tee six to six. This prevents it
from acting affirmatively, and
enables the conservative coalition
to block not only civil rights leg
islation luit all manner of so-called
progressive legislation.
It is impossible, I think, to de
fend this arrangement on the
ground of principle. For the
House of Representatives repre
sents the people of the United
States and its spirit is that there
the simple numerical majority
shall prevail. The bi-partisan deal
in the Rules Committee is in fact
a usurpation of power, depriving
the majority of its rights, and
thwarting the will of the people.
The House can, and we may hope
that the House will, break up the
deal and recover the right of ma
jority rule.
The problem of the Senate, on
the other hand, involves ques
tions of high constitutional prin
ciple. The crux of the question is
nol whether the majority should
rule but what kind of majority
should rule. Shall it be a simple
numerical majority of the Sen
ators present and voting? Shall it
be two-thirds of all the Senators
elected? Or shall it be something

I between the two?
Here lies the crux of the argu
ment. What kind of majority shall
have the right to end debate in
the Senate, and therefore to bring
about a vote? The kind of ma
jority that has the power to do
this has the power to legislate.
