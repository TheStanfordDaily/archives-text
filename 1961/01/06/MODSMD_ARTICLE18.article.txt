# Why They Demonstrated

(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond in a series of articles by Eiclii
Ishii, ASSIT Foreign Scholar from
Japan, concerning - the recent Jap
anese riots precipitated by the
proposal revision of the U.S.-
Japan Security Treaty.)
While the Japanese people were
looking at: the process of estab
lishing the Security Treaty, they
found that the Japanese govern
ment had been highly undemo
cratic.
On the evening of May "19, the
Liberal - Democrats, the ruling
party of the Diet, succeeded in
closing the debate on the Security
Treaty. If a treaty passes normal
procedure, it is discussed and
voted on in the Lower House and
the Upper House, and then be
comes valid.
Under the provisions of the
Constitution, a treaty becomes ef
| fective 30 days after its approval
by the Lower House even if the
Upper House fails to take a vote
on it during that period.
The Liberal Democrats opened
the General Assembly of the
Lower House on the same May
19, to discuss the extension of the
Diet term. Socialist members tried
to prevent the extension so that
the Security Treaty could not be
passed in the Lower House.
They sat down in front of the
Lower House Speaker Kiyose's
office to prevent him from attend
ing the session. Policemen were
called to remove the Socialists
one by one, and finally a prelimi
nary session was opened.
Socialist members refused to at
tend the session. Then at the ses
sion. suddenly the Security Treaty
was put on the agenda, and was
passed in only fifteen minutes
without discussion, since only the
Liberal Democrats were ihere.
Later, on June 19, President
Eisenhower was scheduled to
come to Japan, when the treaty

was to become effective. Roth the
Socialists and the Liberal Demo
crats were undemocratic. The
Japanese people were surprised
that the government hurriedly
passed the Security Treaty only
to welcome President Eisenhower.
Many people began to partici
pate in the demonstrations against
the Kishi government in order to
keep the Japanese democracy.
Among the demonstrators, there
were students, laborers, profes
sors, stage stars and housewives.
Even some people who agreed
with the revision of the Security
Treaty participated in Ihe demon
strations demanding that Ihe
Kishi Cabinet resign.
Why was President Eisenhow
er's visit to Japan cancelled?
Since the Security Pact passed
through the Japanese Lower
House, people were demonstrat
ing almost every day. demanding
the re-examination of the treaty
and the resignation of the Kishi
Cabinet.
They thought if President Ei
senhower were to come to Japan
and be welcomed with the new
Security Treaty, he would believe
this was the intention of the Jap
anese people, and they did not
want to give him the wrong im
pression.
It was insulting to the United
States to have the invitation can
celled but it was much better than
causing a misunderstanding. Dur
ing that time, there were many
clashes between the police force
and the demonstrators.
The other reason for the demon
strations against Eisenhower's
visit, to Japan, was that his visit
was thought to be utilized by the
Japanese government to recover
its popularity, since the President
of the United States is very pop
ular with the Japanese people.
People who did not know much
about political things might have

I voted for Ihe Kishi Cabinet sim
ply by seeing a picture of Prime
Minister Kishi shaking hands
with the President, one of the
most, important men in the world.
Since the Japanese government
' could not guarantee President Ei
senhower's safety, the Kishi Cab
inet was compelled to cancel his
visit, although they wanted to
welcome him. If President Eisen
hower could have come to Japan
without any connection to the
treaty, he would have been greatly
i welcomed.
