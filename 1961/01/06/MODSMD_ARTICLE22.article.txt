j Editor, the Daily:
A number of weeks ago you
wrote an editorial devoted to the
idea that a required course in
Marx and Lenin be part of every
American's college education. 1
, was rather amused at this
seemingly bold proposition; al
though in itself it is not funny,
j you seem to become confused as
I to the purpose of the course.
What does an "objective"
course do for students who are
| required to study for p re-co n
ceived non-objective reasons?
Perhaps I dare not say this, but
might some agree with what Ihey
learn, and if so, has your plot
failed? Or is this an area for
HUAC?
First you complain that we, the
future leaders of America, know
nothing about those immoral
"non-Christians," and yet you
seem to agree that even though
we know nothing, it is right and

logical that we hate and condemn.
What I know about communism
extends about as far as the rather
quick quote you gave.
Is that really enough of an ex
ample to form hate? You, I am
told, are a student of Interna
tional Relations, and you have
thus perhaps come to an "objec
tive" conclusion. But if my con
clusion al the time of registration
for the course is to muddle my
professor's objectivity, I think
that all meaning of the word ob
jective has been lost.
We are again in the "abyss of
lost words" to quote Paul Tillich.
But perhaps we should just rack
the rest of our college and work
ing lives, as well as our political
dissatisfactions, up 1o good old
semantics and forget about being
future leaders since without com
munication there is doubt as to
any future.
