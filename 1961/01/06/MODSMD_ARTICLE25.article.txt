# Howe Injured By Old Nemesis
## 
### 
TORONTO (UPI) â€” Eddie Shack of the Toronto Maple Leafs
presumably was absolved of all blame today for the injury that put
Gordie Howe, of the Detroit Red Wings, in the hospital with a slight
concussion.
Howe, hockey's greatest all-around scorer, suffered a 12-.stitch

cut on his forehead in a collision
with Shack during the first period
of a Toronto-Detroit game last
night at Maple Leaf Garden.
THE 32-YEAR-OLD star of the
Red Wings was taken to Toronto
General Hospital where his con
dition was listed as satisfactory
early this morning, lie is expected
to remain in the hospital two days
and will he kept under close ob
servation.
Quickly processed movies of the
incident revealed that Shack
wheeled to his left when Howe
attempted to check him and
struck Howe on the shoulder with
: his raised right hand as he
; whirled by.
"I RAISED my stick when I
I saw Howe but I didn't hit him
with it," Shack said. "He hit my
I glove and then went down. He got
hurt when his head hit the ice."
With Howe out of action.
Toronto scored a 6-4 victory over
Detroit.
In a recent magazine article.
Howe admitted that Shack "has
been checking me hard . . . for
three years . .. boarding me, hold
ing me and high-sticking me."
But Gordie said he held no mal
ice towards Shack because "Eddie
is doing his job and doing it well."
"I dish it out myself, so I have
to be able to take it," Howe added.
Howe has had a career studded
with both greatness and misfor
tune. He erased the great Rocket
Richard's all-time scoring record
from the books not long ago, but
he has also spent numerous time
in the penalty box because of his
rough style of play.
