# Frank Lane Will Trade To Help A's

NEW YORK (UPI) — Frank
Lane again is on the spot — the
right spot.
As the new general manager of
the Kansas City Athletics, Frantic
Frankie will shake 'em up, shoot
'em around and almost certainly
will move 'em up beyond their
eight-place finish of 1960.
LANE'S CRITIC'S insist he'll
never win a pennant for you, but
admit he'll never finish eighth. |
oil her.
Kansas City's problems of the I
moment have nothing to do with i
pennants. They have, however, i
"bought" themselves a general
manager who's a positive genius
at rescuing hopeless ball clubs.
It all started a dozen years and I
more than 400 trades ago.
"I GOT Billy Pierce and $10,000
to boot from the Detroit Tigers
for a catcher named Aaron Rob- !
inson," says Lane.
That was on Nov. 10, 1948, his
first major deal as the new gen
eral manager of the Chicago
White Sox. Pierce went on to be
come one of the American !
League's great left-handed pitch- '
ers. Lane went on to yank the ;
White Sox out of the cellar and !
become one of the dizziest traders '
in baseball history.
He'll trade super-stars, home ,
town heroes or what he calls "vest j
buttons"- players who don't mean
much to anyone.
"WHEN i was with the White
Sox I got Nellie Fox from the
Athletics for Joe Tipton," says
Lane. "That was vest buttons.
Except Fox turned out to bo a
star."
Lane lifted the White Sox from |
eighth to third in •seven years, the I
St. Louis Cardinals from seventh !
to second in two years and the |
Cleveland Indians "from sixth, to !
second and back to fourth in three |
years.
AND ONE other thing he guar- '
antees things never are dull with j
Frank around.
He talks a lot and follows it up !
with action.
"Why shouldn't I talk?" he i
snorts. "There's no point in keep
ing things to yourself. And cer
tainly there's no point in keeping
trade talks secret if you're trying j
to make a trade."
Lane has two bits of philosophy j
about his trades:
1. Don't try to cheat the other
guy; he won't trade with you
again.
2. Forget the player you traded
away even if he turns out to be a
star; if you want him back, make j
aonther deal for him.
