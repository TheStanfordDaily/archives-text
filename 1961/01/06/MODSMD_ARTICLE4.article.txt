## 
### JERKY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Legislature last night moved up spring elections one week and
set up a committee to investigate the procedure lor selecting yell
leaders.
Meeting for the first time this quarter, LASSU changed tFie con
stitutional dates for spring elections from the fourth and fifth weeks

I of spring quarter to the third and
I fourth weeks.
THE MOVE, effective this year
only, will enable the newly elected
I student body president to attend
the annual meeting of the Pacific
Student Presidents Association,
j He could not have do so had the
elections been run off as sched
, uled.
LASSU members also debated
: for minutes a motion by Off Cam-
I pus Representative Tom Reilly to
| withhold approval of the new as
sistant yell leaders and investi
; gate whether constitutional pro
j cedures were followed in their
selection until â€¢someone discov
ered that LASSU has no power to
'approve or disapprove assistant
; yell leaders.
SO, AFTER the alternately seri
ous and humorous discussion, a
motion was approved directing
i the Traditions and Services Com
mittee to look into the procedures
for choosing assistant yell leaders,
i The group also passed a reso
; lut ion exp r e s sing LASSU's
"thanks and gratitude" to the
lIR and African Desk head Art
Spiegel for a "job well done" and
for "mature and responsible stu
i dent leadership" for conducting
; the Christmas trip of four African
students through the South.
