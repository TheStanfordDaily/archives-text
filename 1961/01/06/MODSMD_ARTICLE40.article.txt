# Moesle Art On Exhibit At Stern Hall
## 
### 
Paintings by Robert Moesle are
now on exhibit in the dining
rooms and lounges of two Stern
houses. Twenty-nine oils and wa
ter colors will be displayed In
Muir and Burbank until Febru
ary 15.
Moesle, a well-known artist in
the Bay Area, has a B.A. in art
from San Jose State, and studied !
for three years at the Rusk in
School of Art, Oxford. Ho plans i
to return to Europe shortly for j
two more years of study and I
work, and to exhibit in Paris and
London.
In the past, Moesle has had one- '
man shows at St. Hilda's College,
Oxford; the California Palace of
the Legion of Honor; the Hilda
Swarth - Raymond Burr Gallery,
Beverly Hills; and Montalvo, Sar
atoga.
Although his manner is expres- i
sionistic, nearly all Mocsle's paint- j
ings are somewhat representa
tional. He implies social commen
tary in his stylized figures out of
context with reality.
Working in both oils and water!
color's, the artist regards both
equally. Some of his most remark- j
able achievements are in water
colors, which many consider a
secondary medium.
