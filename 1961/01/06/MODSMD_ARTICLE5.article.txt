j Can't step outside in fewer than
j five overcoats and three pairs of
; gloves? Cheer up; you'll be happy
to know that you're only enjoying
the worst cold spell the Bay Area
; has had in 11 years.
At least, this is t lie report from

Wednesday night in Palo Alto.
THE PRESENT cold spell
began on Dec. 29 when the tem
pera lure first fell below 40 de
