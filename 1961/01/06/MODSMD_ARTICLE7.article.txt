# Kennedy To Tackle Surpluses
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 5 <UPI>
President-elect John F. Kennedy
and his agriculture secretary held
a "summit meeting of agricul
ture" yesterday to outline a pro
gram for converting farm sur
pluses to food parcels for the
needy and hungry in this coun
try and abroad.
The president-elect and his high
command asked 14 farm leaders
representing the bulk of the na
tion's agriculture industry to stop
fighting among themselves and
present a solid front aimed at
reducing federal intervention to
a minimum.
THIO MEETING came during a
busy day for Kennedy, during
which lie studied the state of the
national economy with Dr. Paul
Samuelson of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, who has
been heading a task force study
for Kennedy on economic prob
lems that will face the new ad
ministration.
Dr. Walter Heller of the Uni
versity of Minnesota, selected by
Kennedy to be chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers,
and Theodore Sorensen, special
counsel to Kennedy, also attend
ed the conference.
The economic study prepared
by Samuelson supported a theory
previously stated by Heller that
the president should be given the
authority to raise and lower fed
eral tax rates within limits pre
scribed by Congress.
IN THIS connection and in the
eventuality of a needed tax reduc
tion this year, the Samuelson task
force recommended that Congress
give' Kennedy the right to con
tinue a tax reduction for one or
two periods of six months each,
subject to having such extensions
set aside by joint Congressional
resolution.
In any case, the task force re
port to Kennedy said there should
be a clear understanding t hat any
tax cut would expire definitely by
the end of 1962.
Following his session with his
economic advisers, Kennedy had
a social meeting with a group of
Negro newspaper publishers.
"We had a very interesting dis
cussion," John H. Sengestack,
publisher of the Chicago Defend
er, said after the meeting.
