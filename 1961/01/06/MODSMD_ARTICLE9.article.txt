# ART COLLECTION
## Many Styles Express Greek Spirit 
### SONYA MICHEL 
An outstanding collection of
contemporary Creek paintings is
now in exhibit at the Art Gallery.
This group of 44 works, repre
senting eight artists, will be on
display until January 15.
Six of the artists either studied
or worked in Paris, but all have
retained their individuality. Their
paintings are reassurance that
abstract expressionism lias not
completely replaced other forms
of modern art.
Til 10 STYLUS of these seven
men and one woman range from
ncar-representationalism through
cubism, primitivism and abstrac
tion to pure expressionism. All
have a strong Greek spirit.
Nicos N'icOlaou, for example,
has the only ink drawings and
water colors in the exhibit. His
nudes are pure and simple of line.
He lias fit the curves of the re
clining female figure into excel
lent rectangular compositions.
In contrast to this representa
tionalism is the work of Alekos
Kondopoulos. a frank expression
ist. and Yiantiis Spyropoulos, a
cubist-abstractionist. AIosL of

Kondopoulos' canvases are large,
full of bold, dramatically-colored
shapes. Two except ion s are
"Spring," a light, brightly-colored
composition of thin, young lines,
and "My Country," a geometri
cally-patterned landscape suggest
ing the terraced fields, orchards,
and mountains of Greece.
SI'YKOPOULOUS is architec
tural in his compositions. They
are scientifically balanced, con
structed of dull-colored blocks
joined, in some cases, by heavy ,
black lines. Their movement tends
upward in precise, definite steps.
Yiannis Maltezos is an abstrac
tionist who moves freely, but in
a definite pattern, about his can-j
vases. Over a background of solid
color, his black or light, thin lines
spiral in a rounded-rectangular
coil, usually ending in a burst of |
bright, solid color.
Movement is also the keynote'
of Takis Marthas' work. Three of
his paintings. "Desertion," "Lost
World," and "Form" are built on
ho r i z on t a I, cradle like curves
which lead the eye up and off Ihe
sides of the canvas.

YIANNIS Mitarakis's form is
also cubistic, but more represen
tational. His landscapes show Ihe
full volume of the mountains of
Greece.
The other two painters repre
sented, Lily Arlioti and George
Mavroidis, might be classified as
primitives. Each works, however,
in a completely individual style.
Lily Arlioti uses short, wide
brushstrokes and dark c o 1 or s.
Although her forms are simple
and bold, there is a great deal of j
movement in them. Her "Dancing
Figure," for example, is merely i
(ho kind of stick drawing taught !
in elementary art classes. Yet the
brushstrokes give it graceful vi
tality.
Till-; PAINTINGS of George
Mavroidis show the least uniform j
ity of style, in "At the Island,"
lie demonstrates an excellent
knowledge of human anatomy. In
"The Horse," he has abstracted
the conformation of the animal
into a curved, shimmering pat
tern. But the forms in "The
Dream" and"The Earth" are j
simple almost to the point of be j
injj crude.

tionist who moves freely, but in
a definite pattern, about his can-j
vases. Over a background of solid
color, his black or light, thin lines
spiral in a rounded-rectangular
coil, usually ending in a burst of |
bright, solid color.
Movement is also the keynote'
of Takis Marthas' work. Three of
his paintings. "Desertion," "Lost
World," and "Form" are built on
ho r i z on t a I, cradle like curves
which lead the eye up and off Ihe
sides of the canvas.

YIANNIS Mitarakis's form is
also cubistic, but more represen
tational. His landscapes show Ihe
full volume of the mountains of
Greece.
The other two painters repre
sented, Lily Arlioti and George
Mavroidis, might be classified as
primitives. Each works, however,
in a completely individual style.
Lily Arlioti uses short, wide
brushstrokes and dark c o 1 or s.
Although her forms are simple
and bold, there is a great deal of j
movement in them. Her "Dancing
Figure," for example, is merely i
(ho kind of stick drawing taught !
in elementary art classes. Yet the
brushstrokes give it graceful vi
tality.
Till-; PAINTINGS of George
Mavroidis show the least uniform j
ity of style, in "At the Island,"
lie demonstrates an excellent
knowledge of human anatomy. In
"The Horse," he has abstracted
the conformation of the animal
into a curved, shimmering pat
tern. But the forms in "The
Dream" and"The Earth" are j
simple almost to the point of be j
injj crude.
An outstanding collection of
contemporary Creek paintings is
now in exhibit at the Art Gallery.
This group of 44 works, repre
senting eight artists, will be on
display until January 15.
Six of the artists either studied
or worked in Paris, but all have
retained their individuality. Their
paintings are reassurance that
abstract expressionism lias not
completely replaced other forms
of modern art.
Til 10 STYLUS of these seven
men and one woman range from
ncar-representationalism through
cubism, primitivism and abstrac
tion to pure expressionism. All
have a strong Greek spirit.
Nicos N'icOlaou, for example,
has the only ink drawings and
water colors in the exhibit. His
nudes are pure and simple of line.
He lias fit the curves of the re
clining female figure into excel
lent rectangular compositions.
In contrast to this representa
tionalism is the work of Alekos
Kondopoulos. a frank expression
ist. and Yiantiis Spyropoulos, a
cubist-abstractionist. AIosL of

Kondopoulos' canvases are large,
full of bold, dramatically-colored
shapes. Two except ion s are
"Spring," a light, brightly-colored
composition of thin, young lines,
and "My Country," a geometri
cally-patterned landscape suggest
ing the terraced fields, orchards,
and mountains of Greece.
SI'YKOPOULOUS is architec
tural in his compositions. They
are scientifically balanced, con
structed of dull-colored blocks
joined, in some cases, by heavy ,
black lines. Their movement tends
upward in precise, definite steps.
Yiannis Maltezos is an abstrac
tionist who moves freely, but in
a definite pattern, about his can-j
vases. Over a background of solid
color, his black or light, thin lines
spiral in a rounded-rectangular
coil, usually ending in a burst of |
