ation answered," according to ST

Sterling will speak for about 45
minutes. There will be no ques
tion period, said Sayler. Question*;
raised by the president's talk
should lie raised in ST & T living
group discussions.
LAST year Sterling spoke on
the accomplishments of the past
10 years. This year he is expected
to illuminate further Stanford's
national and international posi
tion as one of the country's lead
ing institutions, relating his re
marks to his just-completed world
tour, which began with the dedi
cation of the Tours and Florence
study centers.
Stanford Today and Tomorrow
is a student-organized activity
independent of the ASSU struc
ture which holds yearly pro
grams to give students a chance
to learn, by having their questions
answered, the University's prob
lems, aims and activities in areas
outside those of classrooms and
libraries.
