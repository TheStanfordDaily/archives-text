### 
The Bender Room of the Stanford Library will open an exhibit
today of some 75 library-owned examples of "incunabula" books
from the cradle period of the printing art, around 1450 to 1500 A.D.
The exhibit will remain on display for one month.
Among the specimens to be shown are a page from the original
Gutenberg Bible, believed to be the first printed book, as well as a
facsimile of the complete book. There will be four different editions
of tho woodcut illustrated Nuremberg Chronicle, and examples of
manuscript volumes to compare with the printed books.
WHEREAS today's newspaper and tonight's paperback are de
signed to be read and tossed away, many books were once bound
with chains to prevent their theft from medieval libraries.
One such book, printed in 1470, will be on exhibit complete with
original chain. This is the earliest printed book in the Stanford
Library.
Other examples of the printer's art during the incunabula period
will include maps and charts depicting the history of printing.
This display has been organized by Dr. Susan Lenkey, bibliogra
pher on the Bender Room staff, and is her first exhibit since coming
to the United States from Hungary three years ago.
