# Landslide Victory for De Gaulle Peace Plan
## 
### 
PARIS, Monday, Jan. 9 (UPI> President Charles fie Gaulle yesterday won a landslide victory for
his Algerian peace plan in a referendum that surmounted bloodshed and a Moslem boycott in Algeria
to give him a tremendous vote of confidence.
The French president, who had threatened to quit and bring down the Fifth French Republic if his
plan was defeated, received a mandate from 75.25 per cent of the voters to carry out his program of

ending the six-year-old Algerian
war and giving the tortured North
African territory a measure of in
dependence through self-determi
nation.
OFFICIALS estimated less than
22 per cent of the 33 million vot
ers abstained from casting ballots
despite Rightist and Communist
boycott attempts and the admit
tedly severe Moslem boycott in
Algeria.
De Gaulle never-specified what
percentage of "yes" votes he de
manded, although he said he
needed "strong and massive" sup
port. Officials said the vote sat
isfied him as a mandate to forge
an Algerian peace.
Final and complete returns
from all areas including overseas
territories would not be available
until late in the week.
Rightist newspapers which bit
terly opposed De Gaulle here con
ceded defeat, one of them saying,
"France and Algeria have replied
with an official 'yes' to General
De Gaulle."
Voting was peaceful in France,
but paced with violence in Al
geria where at least 36 persons
died in the three days of balloting.
At least 15 of them died yesterday
in three separate battles between
Moslem rebel commandos and
French troops.
Jacques Soustelle, spokesman
for the anti-Gaullist French set
tlers in Algeria who oppose any
thing but a French-owned Algeria,
admitted defeat.
"Strengthened by this blank
check the government will have
every means at its disposal" to
give Algeria independence, he
said.
THKRE was a total of 33 mil
lion eligible voters. The margin
of victory was higher in Metro
politan France than in Algeria
where the 630.000 Colons (Euro
pean settlers) voted overwhelm
ingly against De Gaulle.
The Moslem voters, more than
one million of them, turned out in
roughly half-strength. Many were
frightened into staying home by
rebel attacks and threats of
throat-slittings in the casbahs of
the big cities.
The final official vote in Metro
politan France was 15,198,711
"yes" votes for Dc Gaulle's plan
to 4.996,507 "no" votes against it.
Allowing for invalidated ballots,
the "yes" votes for De Gaulle
gave him a 75.25 margin, compar
ing favorably with the 79.2 per
cent victory he achieved for his
fifth Republic constitution in
1958.
THF Communist "Red Belt" in
Paiis voted about 60 per cent
against him. But officials said
that, as in 1958, De Gaulle got a
lot of Communist votes anyhow.
In Algeria, the vote margin was
less. The army estimated 70 per
cent "yes" for Do Gaulle in areas
which it thoroughly controlled.

In Algeria, the vote margin was
less. The army estimated 70 per
cent "yes" for Do Gaulle in areas
which it thoroughly controlled.
PARIS, Monday, Jan. 9 (UPI> President Charles fie Gaulle yesterday won a landslide victory for
his Algerian peace plan in a referendum that surmounted bloodshed and a Moslem boycott in Algeria
to give him a tremendous vote of confidence.
The French president, who had threatened to quit and bring down the Fifth French Republic if his
plan was defeated, received a mandate from 75.25 per cent of the voters to carry out his program of

ending the six-year-old Algerian
war and giving the tortured North
African territory a measure of in
dependence through self-determi
nation.
OFFICIALS estimated less than
22 per cent of the 33 million vot
ers abstained from casting ballots
despite Rightist and Communist
boycott attempts and the admit
tedly severe Moslem boycott in
Algeria.
De Gaulle never-specified what
percentage of "yes" votes he de
manded, although he said he
needed "strong and massive" sup
port. Officials said the vote sat
isfied him as a mandate to forge
an Algerian peace.
Final and complete returns
from all areas including overseas
territories would not be available
until late in the week.
Rightist newspapers which bit
terly opposed De Gaulle here con
ceded defeat, one of them saying,
"France and Algeria have replied
with an official 'yes' to General
De Gaulle."
Voting was peaceful in France,
but paced with violence in Al
geria where at least 36 persons
died in the three days of balloting.
At least 15 of them died yesterday
in three separate battles between
Moslem rebel commandos and
French troops.
Jacques Soustelle, spokesman
for the anti-Gaullist French set
tlers in Algeria who oppose any
thing but a French-owned Algeria,
admitted defeat.
"Strengthened by this blank
check the government will have
every means at its disposal" to
give Algeria independence, he
said.
THKRE was a total of 33 mil
lion eligible voters. The margin
of victory was higher in Metro
politan France than in Algeria
where the 630.000 Colons (Euro
pean settlers) voted overwhelm
ingly against De Gaulle.
The Moslem voters, more than
one million of them, turned out in
roughly half-strength. Many were
frightened into staying home by
rebel attacks and threats of
throat-slittings in the casbahs of
the big cities.
The final official vote in Metro
politan France was 15,198,711
"yes" votes for Dc Gaulle's plan
to 4.996,507 "no" votes against it.
Allowing for invalidated ballots,
the "yes" votes for De Gaulle
gave him a 75.25 margin, compar
ing favorably with the 79.2 per
cent victory he achieved for his
fifth Republic constitution in
1958.
THF Communist "Red Belt" in
Paiis voted about 60 per cent
against him. But officials said
that, as in 1958, De Gaulle got a
lot of Communist votes anyhow.
