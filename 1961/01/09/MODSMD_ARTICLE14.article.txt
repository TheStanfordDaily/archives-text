# Stanford's Future
## 
### 
President Wallace Sterling's speech tomorrow, which officially
starts the ninth annual Stanford Today and Tomorrow program,
will probably disappoint many students.
This is basically the students' fault, not President Sterling's.
They expect to discover many of Stanford's "secrets," the behind
the-scenes machinations which make Stanford run.
This, however, is not the purpose of President Sterling's lalk.
Its purpose is to elaborate on certain issues in which Stanford is
now involved; issues about which students know a little, but should
know more.
President Sterling will most likelv concentrate on the $2f> mil
lion Ford Foundation grant which presages great things for Stan
ford.
No one seems to know how the grant will he utilized, however.
Many students are anxious to know and perhaps President Sterling
can provide some information on this matter.
President Sterling probably will devotesome time to the foreign
campus program. The tremendous success of our overseas pro
gram will probably lead to an extension of overseas campuses.
There could be a weak point in President Sterling's address,
lie may spend too much time discussing Stanford's glorious past,
all of which is very interesting but also a little off the point. The
name of the program is Stanford Today and Tomorrow, not Stan
ford Today and esterday. Students are anxious to learn what Stan
ford is planning for the future, not what it has accomplished in
the past.
Stanford is planning to become the best university in the west
ern two-thirds of the nation and students wish to know how this
is going to he achieved. More importantly, just what is meant by
the "best" institution? What constitutes a great university? Is it
the amount of money on hand? the number of "name" faculty
members? the quality of the facilities?
There are many questions President Sterling must answer if
ST&T is to he a success. In the past, his talks have left something
to be desired. Hopefully, tomorrow's address will satisfy the stu
dents who are not so much concerned with Stanford's "secrets" as
thev are with its future.
