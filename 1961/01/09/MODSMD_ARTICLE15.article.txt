One good thing to recognize is
that both at home and abroad the
new Administration will need
time to get organized and to get
set to deal with the great issues.
As of now, the situation is quite
Unlike 1933 when Roosevelt took
office. There are grave problems
which need to be solved and there
are agonizing issues which must
be worked through. But there is
no over-all national emergency,
like the closing of the banks in
1933, and, despite the Congo and
Laos and the like, there is no im
mediate crisis of peace and war.
Therefore the Kennedy adminis
tration does not have to impro
vise and to proceed breathlessly
to do things. There is nothing in
sight which calls for a period like
Roosevelt's first hundred days.
The Kennedy administration can
act with deliberation, and for the
problems it faces, more or less
long range in character, it needs
to deliberate carefully, to plan
thoroughly, and then to act de
cisively.
The new Administration will
need time, a few months of time,
even though the men already
chosen have an extraordinary
background of experience in pub
lic life. The Cabinet is sometimes
described as a group of profes
sors. The truth is that they are
a group of public servants, men
who have made public life a ca
reer.
There is not one of them who
does not already know his way
around Washington, and there
are few among them who do not
combine practical experience with
a theoretical discipline in the sub
ject with which they will deal.
They are, moreover, a highly so
phisticated lot. Nevertheless, the
task of policy making in this huge
government is unsettled and con
fused, and the new men under
the President's active direction
will have to work out their ways
of working together.
At home, to take one example,
the problem of the dollar will en
gage not only the White House
and the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve. The central and critical
issue in the balance of payments
is the capacity of American in
dustry to compete more effec
tively in world markets. This in
volves the prices administered by
big business and the wages de
manded by the big unions. The
new Administration will not in
herit, and it will have to create,
procedures for exerting its power
and influence in such matters.
There are two reasons why in
Ihe next few months, during the

shake-down cruise so to speak, the
new Administration must not be
hurried into making major deci
sions in foreign affairs. The first
is that there are several agencies
concerned in advising the Presi
dent, the State Department, the
Pentagon, the Atomic Energy
Commission, the Treasury, and
the Budget Bureau. They will
have to learn afresh what it is
like to work with a President who
administers the government. They
have become used to a staff sys
tem under which, like feudal
lords, they make treaties with one
another. This diffuses and dilutes
decision. For decision is impos
sible unless the ultimate decider
listens to and participates in the
critical debates.
A second reason for not hurry
ing into the biggest decisions is
that they will surely be bad deci
sions if they have to be taken too
soon. There are a number of im
portant foreign policies which
come down to us from an era that
is passing, that of the post-war
world. They will have to be re
viewed and reconsidered and this
will have to be candidly explained.
It will take time.
But if the new Administration
is forced by events to make deci
sions on Jan. 21 or even on Feb.
21, it will unavoidably fall back
upon the old formulae. For these,
however badly they worked, are
venerable and undisputed. Even
if the President and his advisors
have reviewed the old policies
themselves, they will scarcely
have had time to explain their
decisions to Congress, to the
press, and to the people.
Our allies, let us hope, will un
derstand that under the American
political system a change of Ad
ministration is not the same thing
as a change of government in a
parliamentary state. It is a much
bigger and more radical opera
tion. For while we have a civil
service which keeps the govern
ment machinery running no mat
ter who is in the White House,
the makers of policy extend down
at least three or four levels deep
into the Administration. This may
be a good system or a had one, but
it is the system we have, and the
unavoidable delay in coming to
grips with the government issues
is involved in it.
It follows, and this applies most
particularly to Mr. Khrushchev,
that the way 1o deal with the Ken
nedy administration will be to
recognize the necessity of not hur
rying it into action.

Commission, the Treasury, and
the Budget Bureau. They will
have to learn afresh what it is
like to work with a President who
administers the government. They
have become used to a staff sys
tem under which, like feudal
lords, they make treaties with one
another. This diffuses and dilutes
decision. For decision is impos
sible unless the ultimate decider
listens to and participates in the
critical debates.
A second reason for not hurry
ing into the biggest decisions is
that they will surely be bad deci
sions if they have to be taken too
soon. There are a number of im
portant foreign policies which
come down to us from an era that
is passing, that of the post-war
world. They will have to be re
viewed and reconsidered and this
will have to be candidly explained.
It will take time.
But if the new Administration
is forced by events to make deci
sions on Jan. 21 or even on Feb.
21, it will unavoidably fall back
upon the old formulae. For these,
however badly they worked, are
venerable and undisputed. Even
if the President and his advisors
have reviewed the old policies
themselves, they will scarcely
have had time to explain their
decisions to Congress, to the
press, and to the people.
Our allies, let us hope, will un
derstand that under the American
political system a change of Ad
ministration is not the same thing
as a change of government in a
parliamentary state. It is a much
bigger and more radical opera
tion. For while we have a civil
service which keeps the govern
ment machinery running no mat
ter who is in the White House,
the makers of policy extend down
at least three or four levels deep
into the Administration. This may
be a good system or a had one, but
it is the system we have, and the
unavoidable delay in coming to
grips with the government issues
is involved in it.
It follows, and this applies most
particularly to Mr. Khrushchev,
that the way 1o deal with the Ken
nedy administration will be to
recognize the necessity of not hur
rying it into action.

One good thing to recognize is
that both at home and abroad the
new Administration will need
time to get organized and to get
set to deal with the great issues.
As of now, the situation is quite
Unlike 1933 when Roosevelt took
office. There are grave problems
which need to be solved and there
are agonizing issues which must
be worked through. But there is
no over-all national emergency,
like the closing of the banks in
1933, and, despite the Congo and
Laos and the like, there is no im
mediate crisis of peace and war.
Therefore the Kennedy adminis
tration does not have to impro
vise and to proceed breathlessly
to do things. There is nothing in
sight which calls for a period like
Roosevelt's first hundred days.
The Kennedy administration can
act with deliberation, and for the
problems it faces, more or less
long range in character, it needs
to deliberate carefully, to plan
thoroughly, and then to act de
cisively.
The new Administration will
need time, a few months of time,
even though the men already
chosen have an extraordinary
background of experience in pub
lic life. The Cabinet is sometimes
described as a group of profes
sors. The truth is that they are
a group of public servants, men
who have made public life a ca
reer.
There is not one of them who
does not already know his way
around Washington, and there
are few among them who do not
combine practical experience with
a theoretical discipline in the sub
ject with which they will deal.
They are, moreover, a highly so
phisticated lot. Nevertheless, the
task of policy making in this huge
government is unsettled and con
fused, and the new men under
the President's active direction
will have to work out their ways
of working together.
At home, to take one example,
the problem of the dollar will en
gage not only the White House
and the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve. The central and critical
issue in the balance of payments
is the capacity of American in
dustry to compete more effec
tively in world markets. This in
volves the prices administered by
big business and the wages de
manded by the big unions. The
new Administration will not in
herit, and it will have to create,
procedures for exerting its power
and influence in such matters.
There are two reasons why in
Ihe next few months, during the

shake-down cruise so to speak, the
new Administration must not be
hurried into making major deci
sions in foreign affairs. The first
is that there are several agencies
concerned in advising the Presi
dent, the State Department, the
Pentagon, the Atomic Energy
Commission, the Treasury, and
the Budget Bureau. They will

1933, and, despite the Congo and
Laos and the like, there is no im
mediate crisis of peace and war.
Therefore the Kennedy adminis
tration does not have to impro
vise and to proceed breathlessly
to do things. There is nothing in
sight which calls for a period like
Roosevelt's first hundred days.
The Kennedy administration can
act with deliberation, and for the
problems it faces, more or less
long range in character, it needs
to deliberate carefully, to plan
thoroughly, and then to act de
cisively.
The new Administration will
need time, a few months of time,
even though the men already
chosen have an extraordinary
background of experience in pub
lic life. The Cabinet is sometimes
described as a group of profes
sors. The truth is that they are
a group of public servants, men
who have made public life a ca
reer.
There is not one of them who
does not already know his way
around Washington, and there
are few among them who do not
combine practical experience with
a theoretical discipline in the sub
ject with which they will deal.
They are, moreover, a highly so
phisticated lot. Nevertheless, the
task of policy making in this huge
government is unsettled and con
fused, and the new men under
the President's active direction
will have to work out their ways
of working together.
At home, to take one example,
the problem of the dollar will en
gage not only the White House
and the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve. The central and critical
issue in the balance of payments
is the capacity of American in
dustry to compete more effec
tively in world markets. This in
volves the prices administered by
big business and the wages de
manded by the big unions. The
new Administration will not in
herit, and it will have to create,
procedures for exerting its power
and influence in such matters.
There are two reasons why in
Ihe next few months, during the

shake-down cruise so to speak, the
new Administration must not be
hurried into making major deci
sions in foreign affairs. The first
is that there are several agencies
concerned in advising the Presi
dent, the State Department, the
Pentagon, the Atomic Energy
Commission, the Treasury, and
the Budget Bureau. They will
have to learn afresh what it is
like to work with a President who
administers the government. They
have become used to a staff sys
tem under which, like feudal
lords, they make treaties with one
another. This diffuses and dilutes
decision. For decision is impos
sible unless the ultimate decider
listens to and participates in the
critical debates.
A second reason for not hurry
ing into the biggest decisions is
that they will surely be bad deci
sions if they have to be taken too
soon. There are a number of im
portant foreign policies which
come down to us from an era that
is passing, that of the post-war
world. They will have to be re
viewed and reconsidered and this
will have to be candidly explained.
It will take time.
But if the new Administration
is forced by events to make deci
sions on Jan. 21 or even on Feb.
21, it will unavoidably fall back
upon the old formulae. For these,
however badly they worked, are
venerable and undisputed. Even
if the President and his advisors
have reviewed the old policies
themselves, they will scarcely
have had time to explain their
decisions to Congress, to the
press, and to the people.
Our allies, let us hope, will un
derstand that under the American
political system a change of Ad
ministration is not the same thing
as a change of government in a
parliamentary state. It is a much
bigger and more radical opera
tion. For while we have a civil
service which keeps the govern
ment machinery running no mat
ter who is in the White House,
the makers of policy extend down
at least three or four levels deep
into the Administration. This may
be a good system or a had one, but
it is the system we have, and the
unavoidable delay in coming to
grips with the government issues
is involved in it.
It follows, and this applies most
particularly to Mr. Khrushchev,
that the way 1o deal with the Ken
nedy administration will be to
recognize the necessity of not hur
rying it into action.

One good thing to recognize is
that both at home and abroad the
new Administration will need
time to get organized and to get
set to deal with the great issues.
As of now, the situation is quite
Unlike 1933 when Roosevelt took
office. There are grave problems
which need to be solved and there
are agonizing issues which must
be worked through. But there is
no over-all national emergency,
like the closing of the banks in
