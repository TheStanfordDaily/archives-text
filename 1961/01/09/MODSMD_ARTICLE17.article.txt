(Editor's Note: This is the third i
in a series of articles by Eichi
Ishii, ASSU Foreign Scholar from !
, Japan, concerning the recent dem-1
lonstrations caused by the pro-
I posed revision of the U.S. Japan
Security Treaty.)

It is important to note that the
number of the demonstrators in
creased very rapidly after Presi
; dent Eisenhower's visit to Japan
I was cancelled, for people found
| that the present Japanese society
1 is really undemocratic.
j When the people demonstrated,
they were often attacked and
j beaten by the right-wing hood
lums. They rushed with trucks
into demonstrations and even beat
co-eds, actresses and professors
with wooden sticks simply be
cause they demonstrated quietly
without any intention of fighting.
Many people saw these hood
lums resting in the room belong
ing to the members of the Liberal
Democrats, of which Prime Min
ister Kishi was a member.
The attitudes of the policemen
were questionable too. They did
not stop such illegal action even
though they saw what the right
wing hoodlums were doing.
When finally the students
caught the hoodlums and brought
them to the police, the latter set
them free after a few days, and
again the hoodlums appeared to
injure the demonstrators. Also,
the Japanese police forces 1 hem
selves were just like hoodlums.
They also hit students, scholars
and even radio and newspaper re
porters who did not resist, them.
Of course there were many con
flicts between students and po
licemen, when both became ex
cited although neither group in
tended to fight. However, many
cases were different.
Policemen were running after
the students who were escaping
and struck them from l>eliiii<l with
billyclubs. Some of tin* policemen
were using iron billyclubs which
were the same size and color as
the wooden ones policemen usu
ally possess.
Most of the reporters were or
; dered to distort the situation so
j that the students would be blamed
for the fights with the police.
Many students in Japan believe
that there are subversive connec
tions between the government,
hoodlums, police force and news
papers.
Ry discovering this fact while
participating in thp demonstra
! tions, the students have realized
i that they have to establish a dem
i ocratlc government which will not
I use a powerful police force to de
istroy the demonstrations.

lonstrations caused by the pro-
I posed revision of the U.S. Japan
Security Treaty.)

It is important to note that the
number of the demonstrators in
creased very rapidly after Presi

I was cancelled, for people found

j When the people demonstrated,
they were often attacked and
j beaten by the right-wing hood
lums. They rushed with trucks
into demonstrations and even beat
co-eds, actresses and professors
with wooden sticks simply be
cause they demonstrated quietly
without any intention of fighting.
Many people saw these hood
lums resting in the room belong
ing to the members of the Liberal
Democrats, of which Prime Min
ister Kishi was a member.
The attitudes of the policemen
were questionable too. They did
not stop such illegal action even
though they saw what the right
wing hoodlums were doing.
When finally the students
caught the hoodlums and brought
them to the police, the latter set
them free after a few days, and
again the hoodlums appeared to
injure the demonstrators. Also,
the Japanese police forces 1 hem
selves were just like hoodlums.
They also hit students, scholars
and even radio and newspaper re
porters who did not resist, them.
Of course there were many con
flicts between students and po
licemen, when both became ex
cited although neither group in
tended to fight. However, many
cases were different.
Policemen were running after
the students who were escaping
and struck them from l>eliiii<l with
billyclubs. Some of tin* policemen
were using iron billyclubs which
were the same size and color as
the wooden ones policemen usu
ally possess.
Most of the reporters were or
; dered to distort the situation so
j that the students would be blamed
for the fights with the police.
Many students in Japan believe
that there are subversive connec
tions between the government,
hoodlums, police force and news
papers.
Ry discovering this fact while
participating in thp demonstra
! tions, the students have realized
i that they have to establish a dem
i ocratlc government which will not
I use a powerful police force to de
istroy the demonstrations.
