# Music in Review

### D.O. FRANKLIN 
Bayreuth and Salzburg would |
' have been aghast at the perform
ance given by the San Francisco !
; Symphony Saturday evening in i
' Memorial Auditorium. Wagner's j
I "Overture to the Flying Dutch-j
; man" is one of the finest exam- !
j pies of its genre written since the j
overtures of Beethoven. Wagner 1
intended the overture as a sum-1
mary of the action of the opera.
Under Enrique Jorda's conduct
ing. few of the dramatic elements
i of this summary were sensed, and
the harmonic structure of the
overture was almost obscured by
a straightforward, unbending
] movement of the music.
Wagner at its Iwst contains a
certain amount of hubbub as well
as theatrical excitement. Jorda
seemed to emphasize the noise, to
the near exclusion of the inherent
excitement of the music.
The first movement of Mozart's
I "Symphony in G minor, No. 40,"
was executed with grace and pre-'
i cision, and yet depicted the rest
lessness and inner agitation of
the music. However, from here
I on, Jorda took off at breakneck'
speed and finished the symphony l
i in record time.
| The andante was unsteady in i
! tempo and much of its lyricism j
I and tenuousness were lost in a
: raucous sound in Ihe strings. The
change of tempo between the!
Menuetto and the trio in the third
i movement is not in any terms
I justifiable, and the unique minuet j
1 dance rhythm was completely de- j
stroyed by the furious tempo.
Jorda seemed much more in his
j element in the second half of the

concert. Vaughn-Williams' "Sym
phony No. was given a very con
vincing performance. The sonor
ity of the strings was ai its best
and the antiphonal effect of iho
brass versus string choirs was
particularly effective.
The last work on the program
was Prokofiev's "Romeo and Ju
liet Suite." I am sure such music
would bo excellent for a ballet or
movie, and its appropriateness to
these media was well-demonstrat
ed. But it seems questionable that
such music was presented to the
exclusion of other contemporary
works.

Letters to the Editor should not
exceed 250 words. Name, address
and phone number should be in
cluded. Typewritten letters have
a better chance of appearing. Let
ters shall be printed without
change except in the case of po
tentially libelous material. The
fact that any letters hold an op
posite viewpoint from the Edi
torial Board will not matter.
