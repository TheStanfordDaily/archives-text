## 
### 
ATLANTA—(UPI i—Gov. Ern
est Vandiver discussed the Uni
versity of Georgia integration
crisis with state regents and key
lawmakers yesterday behind
closed doors, then indicated in a
post-meeting statement that, he
will announce proposed state ac
tion today.
The state legislature opens its
regular 1961 session today with
the first major order of business
the governor's annual address. He
emphasized that yesterday's se
cret session was for information
purposes only and that no policy
was made regarding a federal
court order telling the university
to desegregate today.
ACTION will be focused on two
other points today. At Athens,
Ga., seat of the university, Negro
applicant. Hamilton E. Holmes,
19, of Atlanta has said he will be
on hand to register. At Macon,

Ga., Federal Judge W. A. Bottle
will hear a state motion that he
uphold his desegregation ruling
until an appeal has been made
before the U.S. Circiut Court.
Dr. O. C. Aderhold. president of
the university, and Registrar Wal
ter N. Danner were subpoenaed
to appear at the Macon hearing.
They will be absent from the cam
pus at the time of the scheduled
integration.
Par t i c ipants at yesterday's
meeting told newsmen they had
agreed not to comment publicly
on what took place behind closed
doors. One. however, did say that
the regents and legislators
listened but asked no questions.
"I will speak to the people to
morrow," said Vandiver in his
only post-meeting comment.
BEFORE the meeting got un
derway. several legislators told
newsmen that they favored tak
ing immediate action to prevent
the closing of the university un
der a 1956 law which automati
cally cuts off funds for the school
if Negroes are admitted.
The crisis came to a head Fri
day when Bootle ruled at Macon
that Holmes and Miss Charlayne
Hunter, 19, also of Atlanta, were
qualified to be admitted to the
university and should bo permit
ted to enroll for the winter quar
ter. Today is the final registra
tion day for that quarter.
Holmes, presently a student at
all-Negro Morehouse College in
Atlanta, said he would be in Alli
ens to take advantage of that rul
ing. Miss Hunter, a student at in
tegrated Wayne State University
in Detroit, has not indicated when
she will attempt to register.
VANDIVKH declined comment
on whether he has ordered state
troopers to stand by today at the
university in case of demonstra
tions against the Negroes or any
other trouble.
The governor said he called yes
terday's meeting to give the legis
lators, who must decide whether
to change state laws and keep the
University open or let it Hose, an
opportunity to learn just what (lie
effect of the ruling would be.
