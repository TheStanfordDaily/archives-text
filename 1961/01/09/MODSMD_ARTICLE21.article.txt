STANFORD'S JUNIOR FORWARD JOHN WINDSOR AND SENIOR BILL McCLINTOCK, CALIFORNIA CAPTAIN
I he Indians' Windsor and Bear forward McClintock will lead their respective squads into tomorrow night's first of the sea
son encounter between the two rivals. McClintock, a veteran of two NCAA tournaments, is Cal's top scorer and Windsor
holds the same distinction for the Cards. Both teams will have no place to go but up when they meet at 8:00 P.M. in the
Pavilion as the Bears have lost two of two in Big Five play and the Tribe has yet to see action.
