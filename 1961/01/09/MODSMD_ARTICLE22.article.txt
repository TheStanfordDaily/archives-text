## 
### 
Stanford's Ernie Cunliffe, mem
ber of the U.S. 800 meter Olympic
squad, set a new United States
record in the 1,000 yard run of
2:07.3 in an allcomers meet on
Angell Field Saturday.
Cunliffe, whose normal distance
is the 880, chopped more than a
second off the old mark of 2:08.5
sot by California's Lon Spurrier
in 1955. (
In another record performance,
New Zealand's Murry Halberg,
winner of the 5,000 meter event

mer mark of 8:46.3 set by Alex
Henderson of Australia and Ari
zone State in the 1958 NCAA meet
at Berkeley.
Although far from the world
two mile record of 8:30.0, Hal
berg's new U.S. standard, along
with Cunliffe's new mark, amply
rewarded the more than 250 spec
tators on hand for the meet.
Halberg, who works as a labo
ratory technician in a brewery in
Auckland, will race next in Port
land, where he will meet U.S. mile
champ Dyrol Burleson in Port
