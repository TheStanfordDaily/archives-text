No, friends, no. Rimbaud is not allowed to smoke on tlic job
and when lie finishes liis long, miserable day lie lias to buy liis
own Marlboros, even as you and 1, in order to settle back and
enjoy that choice tobacco, that smooth, mellow flavor, that in
comparable filter, that pack or box.
Well, friends, you might as well give up because you'll never
in a million years guess why Rimbaud works for the Acnio Ice
Company. The reason is simply this: Rimbaud is a seal!
lie started as a performing seal in vaudeville. One night on
the way to the Ed Sullivan show, lie took the wrong subway.
All night the poor mammal rode the 8.M.T., seeking a helping
hand. Finally a kindly brakeman named Ernest Thompson
Sigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud.
lie took Rimbaud home and raised him as his own, and
Rimbaud, to show his appreciation, studied hard and got ex
cellent marks and finished a distinguished academic career as
valedictorian of M.I.T.
Rimbaud never complained to his kindly foster father, but
through all those years of grammar school and high school and
college, he darn near died of the heat! A seal, you must re
member, is by nature a denizen of the Arctic, so you can im
agine how poor Rimbaud must have suffered in subtropical
New V>rk and Boston, especially in those tight Ivy League
suits.
Mill today at the Acme lee Company, Rimbaud has finally
found a temperature to his liking. He is very happy and sends
greetings to his many friends.
