## 
### 
HAVANA, Cuba (UPI) Cuban
militiamen, showing signs of tir
ing of the game of "invasion
watch," fired live artillery rounds
j in practice yesterday in a move
I apparently ordered to keep the
! defenders' interest from lagging.
Radio •stations still hooked up
t in a "liberty network" for the du
j ration of the "invasion emerg-
I ency" warned Havana residents
| throughout the morning not to
i panic at the noise of the artillery
j practice carried out in and near
II he capital.
COASTAL defense batteries
were permitted to fiit; into the
j sea after the navy patrolled the
area, warning off coastal traffic
from the practice range areas.
| Although preparations against
alleged U.S. invasion plans con
tinued, the fire appeared to have
been taken out of them by Eco
j nomic Chief Ernesto (Che) Gue
-1 vara's measured tones playing
I down the throat and the monot-
I ony of week-long radio exhorta
tions to the populace to be alert.
One militiaman was reported
| to have died from wounds suf
fered when a fellow militia mem
ber shot him accidentally with a
subinachinegun at the Helen Cath
olic School yesterday.
THK Helen School and two
| other Roman Catholic schools
! have been taken over as garrisons
j for militiamen who are manning
' them as "forts."
Observers, commenting on Gue
vara's moderate TV s'peech of Fri
j day night, noted that the Cuban
National Bank head had just re
j turned from Moscow with "the
I word" on the Communist policy
line.
According to the observers,
Guevara's soft-pedalling of the
"invasion threat" along with his
i suggestion that a totally aggres
| sive policy was not always desir
able were interpreted as a tenta
tive invitation to the incoming
| Kennedy administration to make
; an approach to Premier Fidel Cas
j tro's lvgime.
NEKVKS of militiamen doing
I double emergency duty were be
j coming increasingly frayed. Sev

en policemen who were forced to
do militia duty after patroling
their regular beats were jailed
Saturday on charges of insubor
dination to militia officers at the
baseball stadium mustering area
Saturday.
