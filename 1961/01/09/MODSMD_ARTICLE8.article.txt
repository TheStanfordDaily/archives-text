# REPORT TO KENNEDY
## 'Peace Corps' Wins OK from Task Force 
### 
NEW YORK (UPIi A special "task force" yesterday recommend
ed enactment of President-elect John F. Kennedy's campaign proposal
for a "peace corps" of young Americans to serve a* missionaries of
democracy in underdeveloped countries abroad.
The task force considerably toned down Kennedy's original pro-

posai, nowever, oy aa vising
against making corps volunteers
exempt from military service. It
urged a very conservative begin
ning for the program.
KENNEDY received the report
in Washington Saturday from Dr.
Max Millikan, director of the Cen
ter for International Studies at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Kennedy made the
report public here yesterday.
The report suggested that only
a few hundred Americans be sent
to underdeveloped countries in a
pilot operation in the first two
years. It said these few should be
hand-picked so that only the best
qualified of the applicants would
go abroad to work as teachers and
technicians and in other posts.
THE program would provide an
extension of the Point 4 economic
aid to underdeveloped areas and
supplement similar work now
done by thousands of religious
missionaries and employes of va
rious United Nations aid organi
zations.
Millikan said members of the
proposed International Youth
Service Agency should have col
lege degrees and be at least 21
years old. They should be paid
for their work, but not enough
to live on standards far above
those of the natives, he said.
THE 13-page Millikan report on
the youth corps said there was
"a large and growing number of
Americans in their 20's deeply
motivated to place their energies
and talents at the service of con
structive world causes and pre
pared to devote two or three
years of their lives to such serv
ices."
There is an equal need, the re
port said, for underdeveloped
countries to modernize their po
litical, social and economic life by
overcoming shortages of educated
and trained people.
But the task force obviously
was worried at the prospect of a
flood of immature Americans
pouring into African, Asian and
South American countries.
Millikan said the corps should
operate through contracts or
grants for programs administered
by private non-profit organiza
tions.

lege degrees and be at least 21
years old. They should be paid
for their work, but not enough
to live on standards far above
those of the natives, he said.
THE 13-page Millikan report on
the youth corps said there was
"a large and growing number of
Americans in their 20's deeply
motivated to place their energies
and talents at the service of con
structive world causes and pre
pared to devote two or three
years of their lives to such serv
ices."
There is an equal need, the re
port said, for underdeveloped
countries to modernize their po
litical, social and economic life by
overcoming shortages of educated
and trained people.
But the task force obviously
was worried at the prospect of a
flood of immature Americans
pouring into African, Asian and
South American countries.
Millikan said the corps should
operate through contracts or
grants for programs administered
by private non-profit organiza
tions.
NEW YORK (UPIi A special "task force" yesterday recommend
ed enactment of President-elect John F. Kennedy's campaign proposal
for a "peace corps" of young Americans to serve a* missionaries of
democracy in underdeveloped countries abroad.
The task force considerably toned down Kennedy's original pro-

posai, nowever, oy aa vising
against making corps volunteers
exempt from military service. It
urged a very conservative begin
ning for the program.
KENNEDY received the report
in Washington Saturday from Dr.
Max Millikan, director of the Cen
ter for International Studies at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Kennedy made the
report public here yesterday.
The report suggested that only
a few hundred Americans be sent
to underdeveloped countries in a
pilot operation in the first two
years. It said these few should be
hand-picked so that only the best
qualified of the applicants would
go abroad to work as teachers and
technicians and in other posts.
THE program would provide an
extension of the Point 4 economic
aid to underdeveloped areas and
supplement similar work now
done by thousands of religious
missionaries and employes of va
rious United Nations aid organi
zations.
Millikan said members of the
proposed International Youth
Service Agency should have col
lege degrees and be at least 21
years old. They should be paid
for their work, but not enough
to live on standards far above
those of the natives, he said.
