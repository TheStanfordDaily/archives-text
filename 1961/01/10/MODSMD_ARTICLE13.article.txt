## De Gaulle, Aides in Meetings on Algeria 
### 
PARIS (UPI» President Charles de Gaulle sped back to Paris
from his country estate yesterday with a popular mandate to end the
Algerian war and began a round of conferences aimed at carrying
out his peace plan.
I.)e Gaulle arrived from the country village of Colombey-Les-Deux-
I Eglises, to which he had threat-

ened to retire if he failed to re
ceive a "massive" vote for his
plan in the weekend referendum.
He went immediately into con
ference with Premier Michel
Debre at the Elyseo Palace.
A FULL cabinet meeting was
called for tomorrow. Informed

chinery would be set in motion to

negotiations with the Algerian
rebels who have been battling
France for independence.
Whether t he rebels would agree
to negotiate — and under what
terms — was a subject of concern.
A rebel National Liberation
Front (FLN> spokesman in Tunis,
Tunisia, charged the election re
sults were "falsified." Other rebel
officials also denounced the ref
erendum but there was no im
mediate comment from Ferhat
Abbas, premier of the rebel gov
ernment.
OFFICIALS reported De Gaulle
received smashing 75.25 per cent
of the votes cast in metropolitan
France. The "yes" votes ap
proached 17,500,000 to approxi
mately 5.900.000 "no" ballots.
In Algeria, where a Moslem
boycott cut into the balloting, the
final vote was 1,747.529 "yes" to
782,056 "no."
Complete results will be an
nounced later in the week after
all returns are in from overseas
territories and isolated communi
ties.
Sources «aid De Gaulle had
these plans in mind:
Announcement, possibly this
week, of details of a new provi
sional Algerian government to
give the North African territory
more voice in its affairs.
• A possible cabinet change of
one or more posts.
A possible roundtable con
ference with all Algerian faction
leaders, including the rebels.
ALTHOUGH De Gaulle had de
manded a more "massive" vote
than ho got, officials said he was
pleased and took the results as a
mandate for pushing ahead with
plans to end the war that is drain
