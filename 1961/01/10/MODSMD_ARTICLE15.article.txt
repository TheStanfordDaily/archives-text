# Of Some Value

The controversial House Committee on Un-American Activi
ties* film depicting the San t ranciseo riots of last May will he
shown tomorrow evening in Cnhherley Auditorium and will he
followed bv a panel discussion.
Time and time again, the Ihiilv has stated its strong opposition
to the HC.UA. The committee has set itself up as judge, jury and
hangmanâ€”it has gone way beyond its constitutional rights.
The committee does have some value, however, especially in the
field of education. The Senior ( lass has requested the Ihnly to
include an insert iu tomorrow's edition which is the testimony of
Dr. Frederick (lharles Schwarz, executive director of the < Ihristian
anti-communist crusade.
Dr. Schwarz is questioned bv members of I Ik 1 committee and
although most of the testimonv is of little value, out of the refuse
emerges some valuable information. Especially interesting and in
formative is I lie sect ion devoted to a discussion of how I.ommunism
appeals to student intellectuals.
The testimony is quite lengths but is probably worth the lime
il takes to read it. The committee is on fairly firm footing as long
as it relegates itself to an analysis of communist ideology and psy
chology, which is what the Schwarz testimony is basically con
cerned with.
But the committee is not on firm ground when il makes an
attempt to accuse certain U.S. citizens of communist or subversive
activity simply because they do not agree with the committee's
methods or certain unwholesome conditions which exist in this
country'.
The IT CI'A destroys the li\es of countless Americans whose
only "sin" is to be dissenters. And the committee destroys these
lives without any stipulated right. It has legislative function*, but
it has no judicial ones.
Moreover, the HCI'A is guilty of lies and deceit. The film of
the San Francisco riots, which purports to show the truth, does
not show the truth at all. Rather, it shows what tlie committee
would like to see pass as the truth. The film was carefully edited
without regard to fact.
\!I students who have not seen this film should make an effort
to do so. The panel discussion following the film may get at the
truth.
