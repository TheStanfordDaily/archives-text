# Focus on Issues
## 
### 
Focus, an idea presented by
Political Union, is designed pri
marily to provide students with
the opportunity to concern them
selves with crucial social and po
litical issues for a longer period
of time and with more thor
ough study than an isolated
speeeh permits.
Realizing that we cannot allow
our concern to become completely
academic or, even worse, merely
superficial to the point where we
are unable to respond creatively
to contemporary issues, Focus
has planned a number of con
ferences emphasizing the ideas of
nationally prominent experts, fac
ulty members, and students by
means of keynote addresses, panel
discussions and seminars.
This month, I)r Rol>ert Hutch
ins will be the principal speaker
of a conference on "Higher Edu
cation and National Purpose,"
while in February Palmer Hoyt,
William Knowland and Herb
Klien will be the main partici
pants in a conference entitled
"The Responsibility of the Ainer
can Press in Politics."
Hoyt is editor of the Denver
Post and a recipient of a Pulitzer
Prize; Knowland is a former U.S.
Senator and is presently affiliated
with the Oakland Tribune; and
Klein, affiliated with ihe San
Diego Tribune, was the press
manager of the 1960 Republican
Presidential Campaign.
The conference for Spring quar
ter is still in the planning stages
but it will be concerned with "The
Challenge of Our Nuclear Age."
Once Focus is established its
function will be to present ap
proximately one conference each
quarter on ti topic that is of im
mediate political interest and con
cern to students and faculty at
Stanford. The conference will con
sist of major speakers of national
prominence who will deliver key
note addresses.
Preceding the main addresses,
faculty-student seminars will be
held to acquaint the participants
with beneficial background or
supplementary material in prep
aration for the subsequent con
ference.
After the keynote address, or
intermingled with them, will be

faculty-student panels or debates,
as well as further seminars, to
allow the s t udents' recently
aroused interest to pursue at
greater length the conference
topic oi' a specific aspect of the
conference topic.
By focusing on a particular
topic for at least several days,
including preliminary discussions,
as well as by following up the
topic afterwards, Focus hopes to
provide for students a completely
new concept in the study of po
litical issues.
Previously there have been the
usual number of worthwhile
speeches on problems of contem
porary significance. However, to
attain a more lasting effect upon
the people concerned with the
issue, Focus is presenting a pro
gram which will remedy the pre
vious type of situation. It hopes
to sustain and provide a common
focus for the so often short-lived
political interest generated at
Stanford.
The organization of informal
meetings between the faculty and
the students with the central
topic of the particular conference
as the focal point of emphasis, as
well as providing interested stu
dents with the opportunity to
meet the major speakers on an in
formal basis will be the tfoal of
the program.
Students, faculty and towns
people will bo encouraged 1o con
sider the issues presented by
Focus within the scope of their
presently existing organizations
and the problems will be ap
proached not so much as aca
demic questions but more as is
sues demanding personal action.
The programs will try to suggest
concrete ways of acting upon the
issues in order that interest and
concern may find a practical out
let.
Focus has already obtained the
consent of several eminent fac
ulty members to act as advisors to
the program. However, besides
needing the help of the faculty,
Focus will cooperate with other
campus organizations, involving
them to the fullest extent of their
interest and willingness, and will
strive to obtain a mobili/alion of
student concern from all perspec
tives and disciplines.

Focus, an idea presented by
Political Union, is designed pri
marily to provide students with
the opportunity to concern them
selves with crucial social and po
litical issues for a longer period
of time and with more thor
ough study than an isolated
speeeh permits.
Realizing that we cannot allow
our concern to become completely
academic or, even worse, merely
superficial to the point where we
are unable to respond creatively
to contemporary issues, Focus
has planned a number of con
ferences emphasizing the ideas of
nationally prominent experts, fac
ulty members, and students by
means of keynote addresses, panel
discussions and seminars.
This month, I)r Rol>ert Hutch
ins will be the principal speaker
of a conference on "Higher Edu
cation and National Purpose,"
while in February Palmer Hoyt,
William Knowland and Herb
Klien will be the main partici
pants in a conference entitled
"The Responsibility of the Ainer
can Press in Politics."
Hoyt is editor of the Denver
Post and a recipient of a Pulitzer
Prize; Knowland is a former U.S.
Senator and is presently affiliated
with the Oakland Tribune; and
Klein, affiliated with ihe San
Diego Tribune, was the press
manager of the 1960 Republican
Presidential Campaign.
The conference for Spring quar
ter is still in the planning stages
but it will be concerned with "The
Challenge of Our Nuclear Age."
Once Focus is established its
function will be to present ap
proximately one conference each
quarter on ti topic that is of im
mediate political interest and con
cern to students and faculty at
Stanford. The conference will con
sist of major speakers of national
prominence who will deliver key
note addresses.
Preceding the main addresses,
faculty-student seminars will be
held to acquaint the participants
with beneficial background or
supplementary material in prep
aration for the subsequent con
ference.
After the keynote address, or
intermingled with them, will be

faculty-student panels or debates,

Focus, an idea presented by
Political Union, is designed pri
marily to provide students with
the opportunity to concern them
selves with crucial social and po
litical issues for a longer period
of time and with more thor
ough study than an isolated
speeeh permits.
Realizing that we cannot allow
our concern to become completely
academic or, even worse, merely
superficial to the point where we
are unable to respond creatively
to contemporary issues, Focus
has planned a number of con
ferences emphasizing the ideas of
nationally prominent experts, fac
ulty members, and students by
means of keynote addresses, panel
discussions and seminars.
This month, I)r Rol>ert Hutch
ins will be the principal speaker
of a conference on "Higher Edu
cation and National Purpose,"
while in February Palmer Hoyt,
William Knowland and Herb
Klien will be the main partici
pants in a conference entitled
"The Responsibility of the Ainer
can Press in Politics."
Hoyt is editor of the Denver
Post and a recipient of a Pulitzer
Prize; Knowland is a former U.S.
Senator and is presently affiliated
with the Oakland Tribune; and
Klein, affiliated with ihe San
Diego Tribune, was the press
manager of the 1960 Republican
Presidential Campaign.
The conference for Spring quar
ter is still in the planning stages
but it will be concerned with "The
Challenge of Our Nuclear Age."
Once Focus is established its
function will be to present ap
proximately one conference each
quarter on ti topic that is of im
mediate political interest and con
cern to students and faculty at
Stanford. The conference will con
sist of major speakers of national
prominence who will deliver key
note addresses.
Preceding the main addresses,
faculty-student seminars will be
held to acquaint the participants
with beneficial background or
supplementary material in prep
aration for the subsequent con
ference.
After the keynote address, or
intermingled with them, will be

faculty-student panels or debates,
as well as further seminars, to
allow the s t udents' recently
aroused interest to pursue at
greater length the conference
topic oi' a specific aspect of the
conference topic.
By focusing on a particular
topic for at least several days,
including preliminary discussions,
as well as by following up the
topic afterwards, Focus hopes to
provide for students a completely
new concept in the study of po
litical issues.
Previously there have been the
usual number of worthwhile
speeches on problems of contem
porary significance. However, to
attain a more lasting effect upon
the people concerned with the
issue, Focus is presenting a pro
gram which will remedy the pre
vious type of situation. It hopes
to sustain and provide a common
focus for the so often short-lived
political interest generated at
Stanford.
The organization of informal
meetings between the faculty and
the students with the central
topic of the particular conference
as the focal point of emphasis, as
well as providing interested stu
dents with the opportunity to
meet the major speakers on an in
formal basis will be the tfoal of
the program.
Students, faculty and towns
people will bo encouraged 1o con
sider the issues presented by
Focus within the scope of their
presently existing organizations
and the problems will be ap
proached not so much as aca
demic questions but more as is
sues demanding personal action.
The programs will try to suggest
concrete ways of acting upon the
issues in order that interest and
concern may find a practical out
let.
Focus has already obtained the
consent of several eminent fac
ulty members to act as advisors to
the program. However, besides
needing the help of the faculty,
Focus will cooperate with other
campus organizations, involving
them to the fullest extent of their
interest and willingness, and will
strive to obtain a mobili/alion of
student concern from all perspec
tives and disciplines.
