# Why They Demonstrated
## 
### EICHI ISHII 
(Editor's Note: This is the last
in a series of articles written by
Eiclii Isliii, ASSU Eoreign Scholar
from Japan, concerning the recent
demonstrations in Japan over (he
proposed revision of the U.S.-
Japan Security Treaty. Isliii took
part in the March and April dem
onstrations.)

These students resolved to con
tinue their demonstrations until
they succeeded in dissolving the
Lower House, even if pressure
continues from the government.
They are expecting the appear
ance of a democratic government
after the next election.
American students understand
that many people, perhaps even
more than half of the Japanese
people, are against the present
Security Treaty even though they
support the Liberal Democratic
Party. A poll taken at Keio Uni
versity on Oct. 2'i shows that 38.K
per cent of the students support
the Liberal Democratic I'arty
while IS.5 per cent suport Social
ists, and 11.9 per cent support the
Democratic Socialists.
The Communist Party has only
1.9 per cent support of Keio stu
dents. The rest, 2N.9 per cent, did
not show what party they sup
port.
The present Security Pact be
tween the U.S.A. and Japan is fa
vored by 34.4 per cent of the Keio
students, and 34.6 per cent oppose
it. The rest. 29.2 per cent, did not
answer.
This May, before the Lower
House was dissolved, GT per cent
of the Keio students demanded a
new general election of the Lower
House. Therefore, in June when
the demonstrations in Japan were
most heated, their main reason
was in protest of the Japanese
go\ ornment.
As a result of the general elec
tion which was held on Nov. 24,
the Liberal Democratic Party has
again gained a little less than
two-thirds of ;ill seats, and there
was almost no change in the pro
portion between Liberal Demo
crats and the rest.
However, it is important that
the majority of the people support
the present Security Treaty be
tween the United States and
Japan. The popular vote of the
Socialist Party lias increased.
About 43 per cent of the popular
vote was for the Socialists, Demo
cratic Socialists and the Commu
nists.
I fim not a Socialist or a Com
munist. However. I am not satis
fied with the present Security
Treaty between the two countries.
