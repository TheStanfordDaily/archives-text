# More Russian Leaders Expected to Disappear

NEW YORK (UPI> â€” More
heads may roll when the Soviet
Communist Party Central Com
mittee meets today to discuss the
agricultural situation in Russia.
Former Soviet Agriculture Min
ister Vladimir V. Matskevich was
dismissed Dec. 29, apparently bp
cause of continuing failures in
Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev's
pet "virgin lands" scheme to in- <
crease Russia's food production.
And there have been signs that
further reorganization of the So
viet farm program is coming.
Farm problems are causing |
such concern in the Kremlin that '
Khrushchev himself and party
Presidium member Nikolai Igna
tov are known to be closely in
volved in decisions affecting agri
cult urc plans.
I
Recent reports from Russia in-J
dieate that the 1960 harvest of j
grain, the basic food and feed
crop, was even poorer than orig
inally assumed, and fell far below
the goal for the year. This was the
second such disappointing year in
a row for Russian farmers.
There undoubtedly will be t
enough grain to go around, but
the failures undermine the Com
munist commitment to progress
and belittle Khrushchev's boasts
to his people that Russia will 1
catch up and pass the United
States in ihe meat, butter and
egg departments.
For the fact remains that where
the American farm problem is
what to do with surpluses, the:
Soviet problem still is how to in- I
crease ihe output of food and fi-j
bre to raise the standard of living
in Russia. I
Drought, dust storms and other
acts of nature set back Soviet
agriculture in 1960, but there also,
were the usual instances of mis-'
management of the state and col- '
lective farms. Prior to Matske
vich's dismissal, ihe Soviet press
contained numerous references to j
lack of tractors, technicians, spare
parts and the like.
Results are said to bo especially 1
disappointing in the "virgin lands"
of West Siberia and the Central
Asian Republic of Kazakhstan.
First Deputy Premier Frol R.
Kozlov mentioned the setbacks in
these key regions in a speech in
November.
Failure to produce a good crop
in Kazakhstan last year led to the
ouster of Nikolai I. Belyayev. then
a member of the party Presidium.
Khrushchev introduced his "vir
gin lands" scheme in 19.~)4 in hopes
of solving one of Russia's age
old problems lack of a r a b 1 e
land. During the following two
years, he sent 500,000 young peo
ple into the fertile but neglected
areas of Siberia and Kazakhstan
to till the soil.
Russia's farmers have been bat
tling nature's obstacles for cen
turies. Though the Soviet Union
is the largest country in the
world, only 10 per cent of its
land was arable in 195.1 when
Khrushchev pressed his reclama
tion project.
Much of the huge Soviet land
mass, nearly three times as big
as continental United States, just
is not suitable for farming. To
the north are forests and lundra
wastes, along the south and east
are mountains, in the southeast
are large deserts.
This land expanse gives much
of Russia severe climate with tem
peratures and moistures unfavor

able to good farming. The grow
ing season is short, particularly
in Siberia and Kazakhstan, which
limits the choice of crops. Fruit
trees often are endangered by
killing frosts.
Thus the Soviet farmer has
nothing corresponding to the mid
latitude region, the corn belt and
the cotton belt three of the most
productive farming regions of the
United States.
In adflition, Soviet agriculture
I suffered badly during World War
! 1, the Russian Civil War, collec-
I tivization and World War 11.
Mass resistance to Stalin's col
lective and state farms in the
j early 1930's resulted in huge
drops in grain production and
I widespread slaughter of livestock.
| The effects were felt right up to
| World War 11.
Despite intensified efforts to
'expand agriculture output after
'the war. the annual production of
grain per capita in 19.").") still was
only slightly higher than in pro
revolutionary Russia, and there
was proportionately less livestock
j than in 1913.
i A U.S. technical study group
which visited Russia in 1958 re
ported that farm production was
seriously handicapped by lack of
, mechanization and ade c| ua 1 e
roads and transport. Evidence
I gathered by the group suggested
that farm output per Soviet
(worker was only about one-fourth
as high as in the United States.
To spur agriculture production,
the Party Central Committee last
'year decreed lighter party con
trol for collective farms, it also
demanded that the richer collee-
I lives distribute fewer profits
I among their members.
