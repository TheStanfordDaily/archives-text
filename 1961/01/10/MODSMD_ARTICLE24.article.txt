When Paul Brown, coach of professional football's Cleveland
Browns, speaks on the subject of football there is good reason to be
lieve that he knows what lie is talking about. His coaching record of
282 victories, 64 losses and 12 ties since starting as head coach at
Severn Prep in 1930, continuing through Massillon High School,
Ohio Slate University, the Great Lakes Naval Station and since the
end of the war leading the Browns, has more than earned him mspect
as an outstanding football man lie is regarded as one of the finest
coaches ever.
PAUL BROWN'S job is not an easy one. I was to meet him during
Ibis past Christmas vacation, but ihe closest I or probably anyone else
not a football player or coach got was to catch him with a telephone
call. I finally reached him on his one day at home between the college

draft meeting in Philadelphia and
the Runnerup Bowl game at Mi
ami, Florida.
Knowing that I wrote for The
Daily, he immediately got to talk
ing about the Browns' players
who had come from Stanford. The
only player currently with the
team is rugged defensive end
Paul Wiggin.
"Wig is a tremendous football
player," said Brown, "and really
a high-grade guy. In fact all the
boys that have ever played for
me from Stanford have been out
standing men in addition to good
football players.
"BEN ROBINSON, the end, has
also signed with us, but we won't
see him for another year he's
halfway through a two-year hitch
in the Army."
When the name of Robinson
came up I naturally had to ask

about Chris Burford-Stanford's great All-America end who along
with Robinson and quarterback Dick Norman, combined in 1959 to
give the Indians the most dangerous passing attack in college foot
ball. Burford that year tierl Ihe National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion record for pass receptions. Upon graduation he signed with
Dallas of the new American Football League although drafted by
Ihe Browns.
"Although we drafted Burford pretty high up and thought that
lie could probably make the team we couldn't give him the no-cut
contract that he asked for. We knew that Chris was one of the good
ones although he didn't have great speed. His talents, however, were
not even considered when we turned down his demands."
The voice at the other end of the wire paused and I felt that
Coach Brown was musing over something that had been given a
great deal of thought, -something that was vital to the whole func
tioning of Paul Brown Ihe man, and Paul Brown the coach.
"We would have liked to have seen Burford, but the no-cut con
tract is a matter of policy. It lias come up before and it probably will
again, hut no Cleveland Brown has ever received or ever will receive
a no «-iil contract. We've had some great ones —Graham, Motley,
(iro/.a — and we've always maintained iliat policy. I've always felt
in reality that any player could make my team if he was the best
man al the position, ff a no-cut contract bid has been given some man
will not have a fair chance at a certain position."
A Touch of Class in a Rough Business
Paul Brown's teams have always been noted for high class men.
They've all been men with intelligence backed up by brawn. The com
petition system and the smart tough personnel have achieved, under
the masterful tutelage of Paul Brown, that rare distinction of class in
a bruising setting. It has always been that way with Brown teams
they are the kind of individuals that mold together to meet the al
ways ominous Sunday punches of the other teams that took shellack
ings in the Graham-Groza heyday of the 40's in the All-America Con
ference and in the early 50's in the National Football League.
Pro Football vs. College
"We've tried to get the kind of player who loves the game and
actually comes to thrive on the tough battles with teams that are
really out to get us," remarked Brown.
Knowing the kind of college player Brown likes I asked him the
question that had been in the back of my mind for some time:
"Would you compare pro football to college the skill, the spirit,
everything?"
The first thing I heard was: "They cannot be compared!
"IN 1942 MY OHIO STATE team was the national champion, but
it is impossible to compare it in skill to a pro team. At that time
pro football was almost nothing like it is now. But I'm sure even
then they couldn't be compared. Why, I'd never even seen a pro
fessional game. s
"Certainly no college team today could even dream of being com
pared with any professional team. First of all only one or two college
players from a single team ever can make the National Football
League. Spirit can be comparer!, possibly, but nothing else.
"We coach the pros with the same fundamentals," continued a
now excited Brown, obviously proud of the thing that has been his
life. "But a pro can spend all day working: 912 with the books and
pictures, studying and thinking everything out. He can develop
higher techniques. A college boy practicing from 4-6 just doesn't
have the time."
I asked specifically about the spirit: "Do the pros play first for
the money or . . ."
"It's the thrill and love of the game." interrupted Brown. "The
money is just a by-product. These fellows have played football all
their lives all through high school and college. It is a way of life
with them. They can't get it out of their systems. Look at the Giants'
game last Sunday. (The Browns and the New York Giants, long-time
rivals, harl hooked up in a heroic battle for second place in the Eastern
Division with the Browns winning. The Philadelphia Eagles had al
ready clinched first place.) Nothing was at stake but ihe thrill of
playing. Both teams knocked themselves out. The tip-off is the spirit.
Before a game our dressing room is almost silent. Remember one
thing: this physical stuff is real strong—it's not a golf match or a
tennis meet."
