## Cards Open Big Five Play Against California Tonight 
### RON RAPOPORT Sports Editor 
Stanford's seemingly snow
bound basketball team will get its
initial look at the rough sledding
which is Big Five basketball com
petition tonight when the Indians
face an icy-fingered California
five at Harmon Gym in Berkeley.
The opening tip-off is set for
8 p.m. with the Cal and Stanford
frosh teams playing in a prelimi
nary contest starting at :55 p.m.
Most pre-season prognoses give
Stanford Utile chance to do much
in the way of winning conference
games this year as the AAWU
shapes up as one of the best bas
ketball leagues in the nation this
year.
DEFENDING champion Cali
fornia, on the other hand, was
an early pick to give front-run
ning UCLA a battle for the league
title.
The Bears, under new coach
Rene Herrarias, got off to a bad
start, however, and may have
seen their league-leading possibil
ities ruined by a disastrous pair
of games against Southern Cal
last weekend. Although they held
the home court advantage, the
Bears lost twice to the Trojans,
57-50 and 65-57. Frigid shooting
against the visiting Southlanders
made the difference as Cal shot
30 and 35 per cent from the floor
for the two games while SC was
hitting at about a 45 per cent clip.
Herrarias isn't counting his
club out of contention for the
title, however. Cal's head man
said, "I think a club can lose four
games and still win the title. I
think we still have a chance, but
we need help from the bench. We
made a lot of m e ntal errors
against SC and our shooting was
off. McClintock had a bad series,
because a lot of the pressure was
on him."
.MAJOR factors in the Califor
nia attack are forward Bill Mc-

Clintock and guard Earl Schultz.
Both were all-AAVVU choices and
honorable mention All-American
selections last year.
McClintock, 6-5, is an outstand
ing rebounder and a good shot.
He was second to All-American
Darrell Imhoff in both depart
ments for Ihe Bears last year.
Ho weighs 215 and is able to use
his weight to good advantage
when hauling in the rebounds or
setting up screens.
Schultz. big for a guard at 6-4 I L>.
is ihe Cal playmaker and the key
to the rugged defense which con
sistently keeps the Bears at the
top of national defense statistics.
Only an average scorer, Schultz
can once in a while break loose
for a near-20-point night.
DAM: STAFFORD, a 6-3 for
ward, Stan Morrison, the Bears'
center who stands 6-7 l a, and Bob
by Wendell, a 5-9 guard, round
out the starting lineup.
Then Indians have been idle
since a 59-44 win over Fordham
in Iho Pavilion Jan. 3 and this
will be their first Big Five game
for the season, albeit their sec
ond meeting with Cal.
The two squads met Dec. 30 in
a consolation game during the
Los Angeles Invitational Tourna
ment and Cal had to come from
behind to eke out a 40-36 win. The
Tribe was ahead by seven points
with only eight minutes left in
the game, but a final Cal spurt,
including a basket by McClintock
that put them ahead with less
than two minutes left, won it for
the Bears.
Tin: INDIANS should be at
something approaching full
strength tonight with John Wind
sor and John Hendry at the for
wards, Mike Ledgerwood at cen
ter and Bub Bowling and Don
Clemetson at the guards.
Tribe Coach Howie Dallmar
will have Doug Clemetson. Rich
Hosley. Phil Kelly, John Fontius
and others at his beck and call
should they be needed.
