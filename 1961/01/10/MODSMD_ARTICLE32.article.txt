# Mat Coach McKenna Looking for Wins
## 
### BILL BLACK 
With the entire squad from last
year returning, wrestling Coach
Jack McKenna says lie is looking
forward to a successful wrestling
season. The squad will he built
around a returning nucleus con
sisting of last year's co-captains
Dick Denney and Frank Medio,
senior Pete Barhisel and junior
Lee Stephens o 11. Sophomores
John Flaherty and C. B. Simons
should also ho standouts in their I
first year of varsity competition. |
Last season the team broke 1
oven in dual meet competition j
with a record of four wins and
four losses. McKenna says he is
highly optimistic that this record
will be improved upon this year
since ho will have a much more
experienced squad. The toughest
meets will probably be with Cal
Poly, Cal and San Jose State, but
McKenna does not feel that any
of these teams are out of Stan
ford's class.
TAKING A LOOK at the squad
by divisions, Harvey Schwartz
and Jerry Nicolaysen will bo in
the 123 lb. class. Nicolaysen was
on the freshman team two years
ago and is returning this year for
his first year of varsity competi
tion. Schwartz is a junior.
In the 130 lb. class will be
Senior Alt Snoke and Flaherty.
Lee Stephenson will be Stanford's
entrant in the 137 lb. division.
Pete Barnhisel and Scott Romney
will be wrestling in the 147 lb.
class. Barnhisel is a senior and
Romney a junior.
In the 157 lb. class will be Sen-
Phil Murphy and Junior Dave
Stewart. Co-captain Rodle and
Senior Skip Pew are the entrants
in the 167 lb. d iv is i on. Pew
wrestled in the heavyweight class
last year and should do well in
the lower weight class. The other
co-captain, Denney, and Senior
Pete Witter will be wrestling in

the 177 lb. class. In the unlimited
weight classification will lie Sim
ons and Junior Duncan Ross.
This will be Simons' second var
sity sport of the year and if he
shows the same aggressiveness
which he did on the football field
he should make an outstanding
wrestler.
THE TEAM begins action this
week with the first of a series of
dual meets with other California
schools and military bases. The
season will be climaxed by the
PCWI intercollegiate tourney and
the NCAA tournament in March.
This season the majority of the
dual meets will lie at home, pro
viding a good chance for those
who have never seen a collegiate
wrestling match 1o find out what
they are missing. The meets will
be held in the Eneina Gym and
most of them will be in the eve
nings. The meet with Cal will bo
held in Berkeley immediately
after the Cal-Stanford basketball
game. Admission is free to all
meets and spectators are invited.
For those who have only seen
the brand of wrestling demon
strated by the professionals 011
TV, college wrestling should pro
vide a welcome change. Wrestling
can be an interesting spectator
sport without resorting to the
phony antics of the professionals.
