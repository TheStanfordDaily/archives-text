# Lumumba Ministers Set Up Rival State
## 
### 
LEOPOLDVILLE, The Congo
(UPD Two aides of deposed
Premier Patrice Lumumba invad
ed Katanga province with 1,500
troops and set up an "independent
state" within the mineral-rich
breakaway state headed by Moise
Tshombe, reliable sources report
ed yesterday.
Forces loyal to Lumumba al
ready control Oriental and much
of Kivu provinces in the eastern
Congo.
THE SOURCES said that Remy
Mwamba and Joseph Ilunga, min
isters in the Lumumba govern
ment, established an "independent
Lualaba state" at Manono in
northern Katanga and brought in
the troops to enforce their con
trol.
The U.N. command confirmed
that a "number" of troops had
moved into Manono from Kivu
and Oriental provinces and said
they were "well received." The
U.N. said they had no other de
tails.
There was no immediate com
ment from Congolese strongman
Col. Joseph Mobutu to this new
est challenge. He called off a
scheduled news conference yester
day morning and conferred with
his military staff instead.
There was no word fro m
Tshombe on the reported inva
sion.

"EUAEABA" is the fourth in
dependent state set up by dissi
dents since Belgium granted the
Congo independence last summer.
The others are Tshombe's Katan
ga, Albert Kalonji's "Kasai Min
ing State" and Antoine Gi/.enga's
Stanleyville regime.
Manono is situated in the
swampy country east of the Up
per Congo River, some 300 miles
north of the Katanga capital of
Elisabethville. The region is pop
ulated by Balbuba tribesmen hos
tile to Tshombe.
JUSTIX Bomboko, chairman of
Bobutu's College of High Com
missioners, yesterday criticized
the United Nations for doing
nothing to prevent the kidnaping
of Kivu provincial officials by
pro-Lumumbists and taken to
Stanleyville, capital of Oriental
where the rival Congolese govern
ment has been set up by former
deputy Premier Gizenga.
Bomboko complained that while
the U.N. failed to take any action
against the kidnapers, it wrong
fully opposed the movement of
Mobutu's troops into Kivu. A
company of Mobutu's paratroop
ers who tried to cross into Kivu
from the Be I g i a n-administered
trusteeship of Ruanda-Urundi last
week was shattered by the Lu
mumba forces.
