### 
VIENTIANE, Laos - (UPI)
Military sources said yesterday
the Soviets have air-dropped new
supplies to pro-Communist troops
on the strategic Plain of Jars de
spite tiie legal installation of Pre
mier Boun Ooum's pro-Western
Laotian government.
Soviet aircraft also were report
ed landing on the plain's airfield
field by Red Pathol Lao guerrillas.
A United Press International cam
eraman who flew over the airfield
Sunday reported he saw a Soviet
Ilyushin-14 transport taxiing on
the strip.
KKPOKTS of the continuing
Soviet airlift followed disclosure
by military sources that Commu
nist-led rebels, supported by mor
tar and artillery fire, had driven
southward from Phong Saly to
seize control of Nam Bloc, north
of the heavily-defended royal cap
ital of Luang Prabang.
Military sources said the Red
forces entered Nam Bloc Satur
day. The town was said to have
been designated as a main point
of resistance against any possible
Pathet Lao attempt to drive all
the way to Luang Prabang.
The Communist China News
Agency reported that Rod guer
rillas had captured the town of
Nam Pac, southeast of Luang
Prabang.
THERE had been some uncer
tainty as to whether the Russians
would continue their airdrop of
supplies to pro-Red forces follow
ing the installation of Prince
Boun Oum's cabinet last week.
An airlift of Soviet supplies origi
nally had been requested by the
former government of neutralist
Prince Souvanna Phouma, self
exile in Cambodia.
Reports in Vientiane said that
Souvanna Pho u m a had been
urged to accept a post in Boun
Oum's pro-W'j.4tern government.
It was felt this would undercut
claims by the Communist powers
that Souvanna Phouma was de
posed illegally by the present
regime.
