# Socialist Predicts End To Imperialismâ€”At Cost
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
Western imperialism will be
wiped out in less than a decade
in Africa, but colonialist revolu
tions will have to pay an expen
sive penalty. Socialist Bogdan
Denitch predicted pessimistically
last night.
Colonial countries are caught
in the problem of avoiding totali
tarian government while facing
the absence of needed aid from
Western countries.
DENITCH argued against per
mitting a totalitarian government
as a means to economic develop
ment of backward nations, saying
industrialization can't be effective
without democracy.

Despite arguments that democ
racy is not relevant in backward
areas, Denitch believes 1 hat with
out democracy's freedom to argue
and exchange information no in
telligent economic planning is
possible.
He cited as evidence Russia
before 1956 from information
given by Khrushchev condemn
ing the Stalinist regime. Lack of
freedom of give and take and
statistics falsified to show that
quotas were met hindered plan
ning and dictated political poli
cies that were economically stu
pid. he said.
"THE PROBLEM of colonial
countries is that despite their
democratic notions, they have to
take aid from where it comes," he
said. "It won't and can't come
from the West. There hasn't been
a colonial revolution since World
War II that has been aided by the
United States, but many have
faced planes and guns made in
the United States."
Colonial countries have to in
sist on aid with no strings at
tached, for political dependence
on either the Western or the Com
munist block can be disastrous to
a revolution, Denitch added.
He said the United States is
making a mistake in foreign pol
icy by insisting on equating free
enterprise with democracy and
neutralism with pro-Communism.
The talk was the first in this
quarter's Socialist Caucus pro
gram.
