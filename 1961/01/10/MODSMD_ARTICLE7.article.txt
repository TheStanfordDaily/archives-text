## YWCA Treats Woman's Role In Competition 
### JUDY SEABORG 
"A woman doesn't have to sac
rifice her own role in life in order
to make her husband feel like a
man," concluded Mrs. Lois Hogle
last night in the first of the new
YVVCA seminar series "A Stan
ford Woman — Educated lor
What?"
The seminar, moderated by Dr.
and Mrs. George Hogle, discussed
the problem faced by Stanford
women of being forced to compete
with men academically, yet to be
traditionally submissive socially
and in marriage.
HOGLIi, who is currently with
the psychiatric division of the
Stanford Medical School, dis
cussed the role of man, who has
"assumed the superior position,"
perhaps because of superior
strength or his role in sex, and
who "thinks he runs the world,
although lie may not even run his
own family.
"Women," he said, "have been
pul, presumably, in the inferior
position. A man expects his wife
lo be at different times his friend,
mother, lover and little girl, with
out realizing that she expects the
•same of him."
Mrs, Hogle treated the question
of the unhappy, restless Ameri
can woman who feels that she
must compete with men. She con
trasted her to the French or
Chinese woman who has "learned
to accept herself as a woman," as
different from, complementary to
and equal with her husband.
A.MI'iKK AN women, siie said,
"have tremendous opportunities
for being outside the home in
which our forefathers thought we
belonged." She felt that "a
woman's psychological make-up
is part feminine and part mascu
line. . . . She must lie conscious
of and accept the feminine part,
care about herself as a woman,
and nut try tu be what she is not."
