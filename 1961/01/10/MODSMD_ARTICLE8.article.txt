# Georgia Governor Closes University
## 
### 
ATHENS, Ga. <UPI> Gov. Ernest Vandiver last night ordered the University of Georgia closed
until a state law cutting uff funds to integrated institutions can be repealed by the state legislature.
Two Negroes have been ordered admitted to the school under a federal court mandate. They reg
istered yesterday and were to have begun classes at the 175-year-old university today.
Vandiver said he was forced into the action by the 1956 State Appropriations Act, a state law which

automatically cuts off aid to inte
grated schools and requires the
state to close an integrated insti
tution.
Vandiver, in a midnight state
ment issued to Lt. Gov. Garland
Byrd and Speaker of the State
House of Representatives George
L. Smith, said the action was "the
saddest duty of my life . .
The governor, a graduate of
the university himself, said the
1956 statute requires that he take
such measures.
VANDIVER'S statement, read
to newsmen in Atlanta, noted that
"without state apropriatcd funds
and denied the expenditure of ap
propriated fees, the University of
Georgia cannot operate as long as
the fluids' prohibition is contained
in the 1956 act."
The Negro students, Hamilton
Holmes and Charlayne Hunter,
both 19, had gone through all
phases of registration at the
Athens campus yesterday and
school officials would have ac
cepted them for classes today.
IX lIIS statement Vandiver de
clared: "It is the saddest duty of
my life 1o sign an order recog
nizing that such a condition as
contemplated by Ihe (19561 stat
ute does in fact now exist and
that state fund support must be
withheld from the university."
Students snake-danced over the
campus and through Athens
much of the night. Firecrackers
rattled at the freshman dormi
tory. Some photographers who
tried to take pictures of the rowdy
action reported they were roughed
up, and some photographic equip
ment was stolen.
NO OUTRIGHT violence took
place as the two Negroes regis
tered earlier, but at one point
when Miss Hunter was in the
journalism building, a core of
leaders in a student crowd in
the qorridors began to chant:
"Two, four, six, eight — we
don't want to integrate. Eight, six,
four, two- we don't want no jiga
boos."
Dean of Men William Tate
•shouldered his way into the group
and began talking to the leaders.
He took the student body card of
one youth and, when another
could produce no card, ordered
him off the campus.
Later in the day, on a long
stroll across the campus, Holmes
found the situation in marked
contrast to the morning when
throngs of students dogged the
steps of both Negroes.
He was actually alone except
for his attorney much of the time
he walked from one end of the
campus to the other to find the
athletic department.

He took the student body card of
one youth and, when another
could produce no card, ordered
him off the campus.
Later in the day, on a long
stroll across the campus, Holmes
found the situation in marked
contrast to the morning when
throngs of students dogged the

He was actually alone except
for his attorney much of the time

ATHENS, Ga. <UPI> Gov. Ernest Vandiver last night ordered the University of Georgia closed
until a state law cutting uff funds to integrated institutions can be repealed by the state legislature.
Two Negroes have been ordered admitted to the school under a federal court mandate. They reg
istered yesterday and were to have begun classes at the 175-year-old university today.
Vandiver said he was forced into the action by the 1956 State Appropriations Act, a state law which

automatically cuts off aid to inte
grated schools and requires the
state to close an integrated insti
tution.
Vandiver, in a midnight state
ment issued to Lt. Gov. Garland
Byrd and Speaker of the State
House of Representatives George
L. Smith, said the action was "the
saddest duty of my life . .
The governor, a graduate of
the university himself, said the
1956 statute requires that he take
such measures.
VANDIVER'S statement, read
to newsmen in Atlanta, noted that
"without state apropriatcd funds
and denied the expenditure of ap
propriated fees, the University of
Georgia cannot operate as long as
the fluids' prohibition is contained
in the 1956 act."
The Negro students, Hamilton
Holmes and Charlayne Hunter,
both 19, had gone through all
phases of registration at the
Athens campus yesterday and
school officials would have ac
cepted them for classes today.
IX lIIS statement Vandiver de
clared: "It is the saddest duty of
my life 1o sign an order recog
nizing that such a condition as
contemplated by Ihe (19561 stat
ute does in fact now exist and
that state fund support must be
withheld from the university."
Students snake-danced over the
campus and through Athens
much of the night. Firecrackers
rattled at the freshman dormi
tory. Some photographers who
tried to take pictures of the rowdy
action reported they were roughed
up, and some photographic equip
ment was stolen.
NO OUTRIGHT violence took
place as the two Negroes regis
tered earlier, but at one point
when Miss Hunter was in the
journalism building, a core of
leaders in a student crowd in
the qorridors began to chant:
"Two, four, six, eight — we
don't want to integrate. Eight, six,
four, two- we don't want no jiga
boos."
