# MANDATE EXPLAINED
## Wright Interprets Crisis in Algeria 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Professor Gordon Wright, ex
ecutive head of the History De
partment, said last night in an
interview that the only solution
he saw to the Algerian crisis
would be for "De Gaulle to make
the magnanimous gesture of of
fering to discuss Algeria's future
with the FLN."
De Gaulle is likely to make such
an offer of compromise, Wright
predicted, but the FLN, which is
the self-appointed organization of
Algerian nationalists, will prob
ably not accept it.
INSTEAD, they will demand
immediate independence. When
they do not get this, they will in
tensify their guerrilla warfare,
with tho blessings of Moscow.
Wright said that continued
guerrilla warfare would lead to
a worse crisis. The probable out
come would be either an Algerian
revolt against Paris or foreign in
tervention from the United Na
tions, the United States or the
U.S.S.R.
In Wright's opinion, the only
hope for a peaceful solution now
is the "long chance" that the FLN
will accept De Gaulle's probable
offer of compromise.

"DE GAULLE'S present plan is
a sensible solution which would
have been welcome by everyone
five years ago," said Wright. "It
provides for an interim period be
tween the present Algeria and
complete independence. It also
guarantees the Algerians absolute
freedom to determine their own
future. The tragedy is that it
came too late.
Wright's interpretation of Mon
day's overwhelming mandate for
Do Gaulle's Algerian plan is that
all three sides might find encour
agement in it.
De Gaulle is grateful that three
fourths of the voters approved
his plan; the Algerian nationalists
are glad that 40 per cent of the
voters in Algeria boycotted the
election; and ttie French extrem
ists can argue thai De Gaulle has
no mandate in the two most im
portant sections of Algeria, since
the vote there was not overwhelm
ingly for him.
Wright is one of the United
Stales' foremost authorities on
France. He studied there for
three years and he worked with
the United States Kmbassy in
Paris from 11)13 to 11)17.

offer of compromise.

"DE GAULLE'S present plan is
a sensible solution which would
have been welcome by everyone
five years ago," said Wright. "It
provides for an interim period be
tween the present Algeria and
complete independence. It also
guarantees the Algerians absolute
freedom to determine their own
future. The tragedy is that it
came too late.
Wright's interpretation of Mon
day's overwhelming mandate for
Do Gaulle's Algerian plan is that
all three sides might find encour
agement in it.
De Gaulle is grateful that three
fourths of the voters approved
his plan; the Algerian nationalists
are glad that 40 per cent of the
voters in Algeria boycotted the
election; and ttie French extrem
ists can argue thai De Gaulle has
no mandate in the two most im
portant sections of Algeria, since
the vote there was not overwhelm
ingly for him.

Professor Gordon Wright, ex
ecutive head of the History De
partment, said last night in an
interview that the only solution
he saw to the Algerian crisis
would be for "De Gaulle to make
the magnanimous gesture of of
fering to discuss Algeria's future
with the FLN."
De Gaulle is likely to make such
an offer of compromise, Wright
predicted, but the FLN, which is
the self-appointed organization of
Algerian nationalists, will prob
ably not accept it.
INSTEAD, they will demand
immediate independence. When
they do not get this, they will in
tensify their guerrilla warfare,
with tho blessings of Moscow.
Wright said that continued
guerrilla warfare would lead to
a worse crisis. The probable out
come would be either an Algerian
revolt against Paris or foreign in
tervention from the United Na
tions, the United States or the
U.S.S.R.
In Wright's opinion, the only
hope for a peaceful solution now
is the "long chance" that the FLN
will accept De Gaulle's probable
offer of compromise.
