Stanford's plans for the future,
including the disposition of the
.S1 <)() million resulting from the
Ford grant, were outlined last
night in a series of Stanford
Today and Tomorrow talks.
The Ford grant proved to be
the main topic of the evening as
Dean William Craig and David
Jaoobson, general secretary of
the University, told how the
money is to be spent and assigned
priority to several projects.
ACCORDING to Jaeobson, who
spoke to freshmen women at
Roble, top priority has been given
to increasing faculty salaries in
an effort to attract men to Stan
ford who are the leaders in their
field.
Dean Craig also gave leading
priority to the undergraduate li
brary, a $4 million, four-story
structure that will be located to
the rear of Cubberley Auditorium.
Construction is expected to start
within the next two years.
Secondary priority has been
given to undergraduate housing,
including eight new fraternities
costing $385,000 each, the first
set of which is expected to be
completed a year from now.
Also high on the priority list is
integrated housing for 600 stu
dents, double-decking of outer
quad, the construction of a new
physics building to be completed
in September, 1962, and the devel
opment of mall areas.
PLANS tentatively call for a
new pavilion within the next ten
years, accor d in g to Ernest
Arbuckle who spoke at Trancos.
In the area of cirrueulum. the
University plans to bring the Hu
manities up to the standard of
the physical sciences, continue to
advance the physical sciences and
engineering, increase interna
tional studies, improve the fine
arts program, and attempt to
bridge the gap between humani
ties and sciences.
One of the major trends of the
next few years will be the expan
sion of the graduate division.
Craig predicted the increase will
be by 50 per cent by 1970.
ARBUCKLE sairl that in the
next ten years Stanford hopes to
be aide to admit all qualified stu
dents, regardless of financial
need. This will be accomplished
by increasing the aid program by
10 pei 1 cent and the loan program
by 5 per cent, with the money
coming in large measure from the
Ford grant.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice pres
ident in charge of finance, said
that more seminar-type courses
will be offered to undergraduates
in the next several years. He indi
cated also that the faculty resi
dent program will be expanded.
I'ROFESSOR David B. Sten/.el,
