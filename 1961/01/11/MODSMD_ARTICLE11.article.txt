## Rapid Changes Made in China In Recent Years 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
"To go into China is to go into
tho middle of an explosion," began
Felix Greene last night in his
speech "Red China Revisited," the
opening orf the Tuesday Evening
j Series.
In the last three years he has
made two lengthy visits to China
; and he described the changes in
i the country between the two vis
; its.
HE NOTED a general improve
ment in the welfare of the people
in clothes, stores, the many peo
i pie with cameras, the erection of
buildings. There was an increase
' in population of forty million in
the last three years, with 1,700
people born each hour.
"I had a feeling they were fear
ing the possibility of war with
the United States." from the de
cent rali/ation of industry, many
; areas of self-sufficient food sup
ply, and the development of mili
tia. He was particularly impress
ed that all the peasants are armed
i with guns they may take home,
showing the government's lack of
fear of insurrection.
THE BIGGEST change was in
the development of communes.
! "Wherever you are in China you
will be in a commune.
"There is this great hunger,
this great passion for education
in China." Every factory or com
mune has a "spare time school"
for adult education.
Running China are thirteen mil
lion Communists" . . . hardened,
disciplined, selfless, incorruptible
. . . they are not open, they are
j convinced, and they are ready to
dedicate their lives," with "... a
I sort of deafness to anything that
I might shake their belief." In their
j effort for all people to be on the
i same level, leaders must spend
j one month of every year working
in the lowest position of the peo
ple they have supervision over.
IN REFERENCE to Russian
and Chinese dissension, "I think
we would be making a big mis
i take if we think there is any ma
jor split between them."
The greatest problem concern
ing the United States and China
is mutual ignorance, he feels.
While "They have chosen to pay
attention to only those parts of
American culture that discredit
us." on the other hand. "China is
far more lively, far more crea
tive, far more vigorous, far more
| intelligent than we ever give her
credit for."
