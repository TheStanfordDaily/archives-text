Student a who see 11 ie ITCITA film, "Operation Abolition,"' to
ni«ilit should l>e aware that what they see is far from what actually
happened at the San Francisco hearings last May.
The film attempts to portray the demonstrations against the
HCUA as a Communist-inspired, Communist-led riot and that
the students were simply dupes of the Communists. \ou could
very well reach this conclusion if you utilize the film as your one
source of information.
'I he truth is the film has heen distorted and contains many
inaccuracies. 11 is impossible to enumerate all of them in this
editorial, but most of them will he discussed at the panel debate
which will follow the showing of the film.
The method employed in the creation of the film is indicative
of ihe means the committee uses. Here is how it was reported by
Paul Jacobs in the Nov. 21 issue of Reporter magazine.
"The movie is made up almost entirely of newsreel shots,
filmed by TV cameramen who covered the events lor stations
KRON and KPIX in San Francisco. After the hearings had been
completed, two committee stall" members—illiam \\ heeler, chiel
West Coast investigator, and Fulton (Ruddy) Lewis 111—went to
the television stations with subpoenas for all the newsreel film
that had been shot, during the demonstrations.
"They then selected the footage they wanted and had prints
made of it. telling the stations that the film was needed for "docu
mentation." Neither the studios, the stall photographers, nor the
reporters were paid for their film, although "Operation Aboli
tion" 1 is ostensibly a commercial venture.
"The prints were sent to Washington, where the committee
stall edited the film and wrote a commentary for it. After that
had been done, film and commentary were turned over to a com
mercial film company, W ashington \ ideo Productions, to be made
into a movie.
"Ruddv Lewis assisted the companv with the technical work
on the film, and the narrator s voice is his. Representatives Fran
cis E. \\ alter, chairman of the committee, and Cordon Scherer, a
committee member, both appeared as commentators. Ihe film
was then made an official House document and advertised by the
committee in a special publication, "The Communist-Led Riots
Against the House Committee on In-American Activities in San
Francisco, IVlay 12-14, l ( )(>0."
"The film itself opens without any of the usual credits. In
stead, Congressman Walter launches immediately into the main
theme of the picture, which is to suggest that the demonstrations
were Communist-inspired and Communist-led. In the attempt to
prove this assertion, both the narration and the wav the film clips
were edited deliberately distort a number of facts.
"Students at the I niversity of California . • . have prepared a
detailed answer to the movie v\lnch they are distributing v\herever
thev can. William \\ heeler of the House committee stall has ad
mitted on a Los Angeles T\ program that there were distortions
in the film."
These distortions will be brought to tonight during the
panel debate. In the meanwhile, it is important to remember as
vou watch the film that von are watching a big lie.
