Remember the secret handshake? Remember the elaborate
initiation ritual with hooded figures made mysterious by candle*
light? Remember the hazing of pledges? And the paddling?
Remember the jewel-rimmed fraternity pin which you wore, dis
creetly conspicuous, at the lower point of your Tattersall waist
coat ?
Of course many of us put much of this behind us about the
time we got out of college and began to participate in life. But
good old Barry Goldwater, who forgets nothing and discards
nothing, continues to believe in fraternities as he believes in the
open shop, the straight razor and the economics of Chester Alan
Arthur.
When the National liilerfrateinilv Conference held its annual
convention a week or so ago, whom did it choose as its speaker?
Why, Senator Goldwater, naturally. \\ ho else could be counted
upon to characterize the fraternity system us '"a bastion of Ameri
can strength?" \\ ho else would say that "we look more and more
to fraternities to provide our future"' and that "where fraternities
are not allowed, communism flourishes? * lie singled out Harvard
I niversitv as a seat of learning where, in the absence of fraterni
ties, Communists and Socialist philosophies are allowed to breed
a faithless generation.
W ell, to be sure, there isn't must that can be said in defense
of Harvard except as an educational institution. hven it Har
vard adopted fraternities, what good would it do? I hey <1 prob
ably be thrown out of the Interfraternity Conference in no time
fur admitting members without regard to race or religion or social
status. At Harvard, the fraternities themselves would undoubtedly
become socialistic, preaching universal, instead of selective broth
erhood and advocating social equality in place of snobbishness.
Indeed, if this new-fangled idea of democracy is allowed to spread,
such exclusiveness may become as much of an anachronism every
where as Senator Goldwater himself.
