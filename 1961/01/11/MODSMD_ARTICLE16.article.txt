terday tackled I ho balance of pay
ments and space problems con
fronting his administration before
flying to his pro-inaugural retreat

Maintaining a punishing sched
ule, Kennedy hold a round of
morning conferences in New
York, received a task force re
port on morlioal care for the aged,
and then moved on to Washington
for still more meetings with top
aides.
The mcdical care task force ree
ommended that Kennedy broaden
still further his plan for tying
treatment for the elderly to the
Social Security system. The ex
panded plan would cover 14.5 mil
lion persons at an annual cost of
about $1 billion.
The task force, headed by Dr.
Wilber J. Cohen of the University
of Michigan, offered legislation
which would go considerably fur
ther than the hill sponsored by
Kennedy in the Senate last year.
The president-elect had no public
comment on the proposal.
In Washington, Kennedy con
ferred with Robert B. Anderson
outgoing treasury secretary, Vice
President-elect Lyndon B. John
son and Sen. Robert S. Kerr (D-
Okla.) on this country's troubles
with the outflow of gold.
Later. Kennedy conferred with
his Treasury Secretary-designate
Douglas Dillon before moving on
to Johnson's office to receive a
special task force report on space.
His final Washington confer
ences weVe with Clark M. Clifford,
his chief liaison man with the
Eisenhower Administration, and
several staff aides.
During the flight from New
York to Washington Kennedy
spent most of his time conferring
with George F. Kennan, former
Stale Department expert on So
viet affairs who is now connected
with the Institute for Advance
Studies at Princeton, N.J.
There has been considerable
speculation that Kennan will be
named to a post in the new ad
ministration.
Kennedy discussed with Ander
son, Johnson and Kerr the out
flow of dollars from this country
and losses in this nation's gold
reserves. In 1960, foreigners
earned about $3.5 billion in U.S.
dollars and used $2 billion to buy
U.S. gold.
Gold sales are made only to for
eign governments and central
banks. But many of them acquire
dollars from businessmen who
sell the dollars they receive from
trade and investments to their
own governments for local cur
rency.
The Eisenhower Administration
has takon a number of steps to
reduce the deficit in this country's
in t er n a tio n a 1 accounts and
strengthen the dollar. But U.S.
gold reserves have continued to
drop. The Treasury sold $131 mil
lion of gold in the first three
i working days of 1961.
