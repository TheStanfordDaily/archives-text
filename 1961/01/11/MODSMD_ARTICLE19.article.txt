Something New
THERE'S A SLIGHT lull in tho sporting world, if you would eare
If) call it that. The 1960 Stanford football season is finished and the
Indian basketball contingent ha-s just barely begun league warfare.
For the past term the gridiron madness got the headlines and
basketball will crowd the sport pages soon enough and so today is
a good time to sneak in a few words about one of the less spectacular
Stanford teams.
We're speaking about the newly organized and highly successful
Stanford chess team.
THE VENTURE WAS started by Rex Wilcox, a junior English
major, less than a year ago. Actually some of the members had been

playing one another since their
freshman year, but it was only
recently that tho group branched
out and scheduled other colleges.
In their first intercolligiate
match, against San Jose State
last quarter, the chessmen won,
4 i 2-\s, and with each individual
match worth one point in chess
competition, that score represents
an overwhelming margin.
Then, after tho initial victory
over the Spartans, the locals took
on Cal and came out on top again,
dropping the Bears, 4-1.
Those who competed in tho first
two matches were: Ben Carter,
team captain and a senior; Bill
Rogers, Bob Lorber, Edgar Bogas
and Wilcox, all juniors, and soph
omore John Mortz.
WILC OX holds an expert's rat
ing, a distinction that is awarded
only after years of competition in

national tournaments and is currently held by only about 100 players
in the United States. Although they don't officially hold the rating,
Mortz. Rogers, Bogus and Carter also are at about ihe experts' level
of skill. Lorber is the top man on the Stanford contigent, having
once held a master's rating, something that can be said of only ."50
other chessmen in the U.S. each year.
As Rex Wilcox put it. "We've probably got more strength through
all six boards than any other college team in the country.''
C'HKSS IS CERTAINLY a popular college pastime. It is also one
of ihe most universal pastimes, being played in almost every country
of the world, and it is one of the oldest, dating back some 6,000 years.
The intensity with which it is played also gives chess a unique
appeal. Although chess has all the essentials of a game, enthusiasts
attack the pastime with the same mental and physical concentration
that many athletes devote to major sports.
Lorber is typical of those who take chess seriously.
Bob took up the game when he was eight years old and began
to play seriously when he was 15. After deciding to take it up in
earnest, Bob spent about 40 hours a week analyzing the moves and
practicing.
THE TIME WAS WELL spent; Lorber began playing in the na
tional and statewide tournaments, finishing seventh in the U.S.
Juniors in 1955 and second in the Nevada championships.
Since then he lias semi-retired. As Bob put it, "There comes a
point when you've got to devote all your time to chess if you're going
to improve. In 1955 I was beating Bobby Fischer the current U.S.
champion- easily, but in the last five years he's been playing almost
constantly and getting better and better."
Right now Bob is concentrating on bridge, but he drops the
cards long enough to help out the chess team.
"ONE OTHER THING we're trying to do,'' adds Bob. "is to hold
a University tournament. As soon as we can get some students inter
ester. we'll get matches started, excluding Ihe present team players.
More Matches Coming Up
Besides an intraschool tourney other plans are being laid by the
team members. Some of the future events in the works are a match
with the Mechanics Institute Chess Club, a group of the best chess
players in San Francisco; a trip to Southern California for matches
with USC and UCLA, a radio match with the University of Moscow
and, just maybe a trip hack East for the National Intercollegiate
Tournaments.
Ed Bogas is lining up the University of Moscow match. Teams
will communicate by ham radio; opponents 10.000 miles away will
"face" each other via the microphone. Bogas speaks Russian and
can handle the language problem.
THE CHICSS TEAM enjoys none of the benefits of University
sponsored sports. Matches are arranged through friends other col
lege chess players who compete in national tournaments at the
opposing schools. Time, place, facilities, all the details are in the
hands of the Students. Members pay their own expenses and do
their own coaching.
Strange as it seems, some of the local matches are harder to ar
range than ihe Moscow affair. Team members are finding that ex
penses are becoming an increasingly larger factor as the longer
trips are planned. Because of this, the team might try to get official
University recognition and aid.
Hut whether they get official status or not, chess is here to stay
and it's good to see a new team off to such a fine start.
