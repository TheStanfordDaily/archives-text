TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
