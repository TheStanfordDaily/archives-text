TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

the consultation was concluded.)

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

the consultation was concluded.)

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.
(Thereupon, at 4:15 p.m., Wednesday, May 29, 1957,

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

the consultation was concluded.)

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.

TESTIMONY OF DR. FREDERICK CHARLES
SCHWARZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CHRISTIAN
ANTI-COiMMUNIST CRUSADE
Mr. Arens. Kindly identify yourself by name, resi
dence, and occupation.
Dr. Schwarz. My name is Frederick Charles
Schwarz, S-C-H-W-A-R-Z. My official home address is
142 Concord Road, Concord, Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia. My American address is Christian Anti-Com
munist Crusade, Box 890, Long Beach, Calif., and I am
the executive director of the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade.
Mr. Arens. Dr. Schwarz, on behalf of the staff of
the Committee on Un-American Activities, I am happy
to welcome you here for this staff consultation, which
is pursuant to the overall policy of this committee in
which we try to contact and make a record of statements
of people who have had extensive experience and can
shed some light on many of the facets of the world Com
munist conspiracy.
Would you kindly, for our record, give us a word
about your own personal history and background ?
Dr. Schwarz. I was born in Brisbane, Australia,
on the 15th of January 1913. I was educated at the schools
of Brisbane and I attended the University of Queensland,
which is the northeastern state, of which Brisbane is the
capital. At the university I studied, first, science. I gradu
ated in science with major subjects mathematics and
physics. I later graduated in arts in which I studied
philosophy and political economy. After teaching school
and being a lecturer in mathematics and science in the
Queensland Teachers College, I graduated in medicine
and surgery from the University of Queensland Medical
School. Following graduation, I established a general
medical practice in Sydney and, for a time, was psychia
trist for the Cathedral Marriage Guidance Clinic of
Sydney and the New South Wales Community Hospital.
I am an evangelical Christian of Baptist denomina
tion and have been a lay preacher for many years.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, would you kindly tell us how
you became interested in your work in the anti-Commu
nist movement?
Dr. Schwarz. At the University of Queensland, in
the late 19305, T was active in the Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship while the Communists were also active at the
university in the Labor Oub. We entered into a dispute
on the philosophical conflict between God and materialism.
I had my first debate with a Communist in 1940 when I
debated with Max Julius, a very prominent Communist,
now a member of the Central Committee of the Australian
Communist Party.
Following this debate my interest quickened, and I
read profoundly of the Communist text of Marx, Lenin,
and Stalin and challenged other Communists to debate.
O\or a period of years I was active in lecturing against
communism and debating with Communists within Aus
tralia, with special emphasis on the philosophic conflict
of God and the value of the individual, as against materi
alism and the individual's insignificance in relation to the
state.
Most of my activities were confined to church and
religious citcles and conducted in association with my
medical practice.
In I made my first trip abroad, visited in
America, and returned to Australia. The response to the
message was such, and the need such, that my medical
practice is now closed; and I am on my sixth world tour
and I am now executive director of the Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade, which is active in America and
Australia and indirectly in many other parts of the
world.
Mr. Arens. 1 hank you for that background informa
tion, Doctor.
May I pose this general question to you as a point
of departure in your consultation with us today: How
would you characterize or describe the ideology and
morality of communism, and how, in your judgment, can
that ideology and morality be countered or met in this
world struggle?
Dr. Schwarz. The ideology of communism is applied
Godless materialism. Ihe problem that perplexes many
people is the overwhelming appeal that communism
apparently exercises for the student mind.
Mr. Arens. What is the nature of that appeal,
Doctor ?
Dr. Schwarz. 1 he nature of that appeal is a promise
that the student can achieve two things by association
with the Communist Party. He can participate in the
conquest of the world and, following the conquest of the
world, he can then participate in a program to change

human nature, perfect human character, and populate the
entire earth with a new quality of personality infinitely
superior to any that history has ever known. The appeal
that attracts the young student is almost a religious appeal
that his life can be utilized for the regeneration of all
mankind.
i Mr. Arens. Would you care to elaborate on that
theme, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. When you ask the Communist a simple
question: " How are you going to change human nature?"
they would answer with one word, and that word is
" science." "We are scientists. Science has changed the
material world. Science has changed the world of agri
culture. Science has changed the world of animal hus
bandry. We can use science to change human nature
itself."
This sounds very appealing. You can understand
how this sounds to a young student infatuated with the
techniques of science. To participate in using science for
its greatest achievement is a seductive vision.
However, to be scientific you must "follow scientific
laws, and communism then proceeds to give it three sci
entific laws. These laws are as follows:
The first one is " There is no God." They are proudly,
unashamedly atheistic in theory and in practice. When
they deny God, they simultaneously deny every virtue and
every value that originates with God. They deny moral
law. They deny absolute standards of truth and righteous
ness. An entire civilized code of moral and ethical values
is destroyed so that they are free to erect in their place
new moral and ethical standards as the occasion demands.
The second laW of communism is that man is a
material machine. He is matter in motion and nothing
more. Man is a body, and he is completely describable in
terms of the laws of chemistry and physics. Man has no
soul, no spirit, no significant individual value, no continuity
of life. He is entirely an evolutionary product, the specie
Homo sapiens, and subject to modification, adaptation, and
transformation by the applied, established laws of animal
husbandry.
William Z. Foster, chairman of the American Com
munist Party, expresses it in his book, the Twilight of
World Capitalism, which he wrote in 1949. In the last
chapter, The Advent of the Socialist Man, he writes:
Henceforth, the evolution of human species must be
done artificially by the conscious action of man himself.
Their second law, therefore, is the material animal nature
of man.
The third law of communism is economic deter
minism. It states that the qualities of human intelli
gence, personality, emotional and religious life merely
reflect the economic environment; that in the last analysis
what we think, what we feel, what we believe, whom we
love, and whom we worship is simply an expression of
the environment in which we are raised, and since that
environment is primarily concerned with economic forces,
in the final analysis, man is a determined economic being.
Mr. Arens. I can hardly restrain myself at this point
from posing this question, even at the risk of breaking
the theme: If the Communists' major premise is correct,
that you and I are not morally responsible, then why would
the Communists in the same breath turn around and try
to assess moral responsibility against what they describe
as the capitalists ?
Dr. Schwarz. In the final analysis they do not do
that. They consider themselves as superior to the capi
talist as the farmer is superior to his animal. Moral
responsibility is not involved. They understand capitalist
motivation as the automatic outcome of capitalist eco
nomics. Since the root is evil the fruit must be so. It is
their duty to destroy the root and frequently the fruit.
The concept of his moral guilt does not enter into it any
more than when a farmer destroys an animal giving a
positive tuberculin reaction. You do not consider that
animal morally responsible. He belongs to a certain class
which by reason of its association, has developed a certain
potentially dangerous character, and no matter how splen
did the animal, its destruction is obligatory.
Communism rests on a class concept. They believe
the proletariat class is the progressive class of history and
that the capitalist classes, the degenerate classes, are dis
carded by history and must be destroyed. To them this is
the law of historical development. To argue on a bourgeois
moral basis merely reflects degenerate class origin.
Economic determinism is the third law of commu
nism.
Applying these laws, communism asserts that the
environment of capitalism is a degenerative environment
and it creates degenerate people. The responsibility for
individual evil, for vice and crime, for selfishness and
greed in all its manifestations is not that of the individual.
It is the projection of the capitalist environment into the
individual.
The Communist believes that if you are going to
change the individual, if you are going to change mankind,
it is foolish to think that you can do it while the degenera
tive capitalist environment exists. First, you must conquer
the world and, having conquered the world, you must
destroy the capitalist environment which is built on profit,
selfishness, and greed. You must replace it by socialism
which is built on service, co-operation, and unselfishness,
so that from birth the experiences of the environment will
build into the character unselfishness, co-operation, and
service, and as these children mature to adolescents and
adults everyone will work because they love tp work;
everyone will give because it is better to give than receive;
the hand of no man will be raised in anger against his
brother; there will no longer be any need for government
and government will wither and die. There will be no
need for a police force; there will be nothing for police
to do. There will be no need for an income-tax depart
ment because everyone working, according to his natural

impulses, gives of his best for the general well-being, and
out of the abundance thus created retains only his own
personal needs. Farewell anger, lust and greed, envy,
malice and strife, pestilence and war; enter golden, com
panionable, co-operative brotherhood; mankind will live
together in the glorious day of communism that has
dawned on the earth.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, may I pose this question: How,
to the Communist mind, is this world of goodness and of
plenty and of unselfishness and love, consistent with the
program which we see in effect in Communist regimes,
a program of bloodshed, of deceit, of inhumanity, and
the like?
Dr. Schwarz. It is the justification for it all. You see
the goals. To sacrifice one or two generations is not a very
big price to pay for such a glorious goal from their point
of view.
The Communists are confronted with this prob
lem t When they conquer the world, they are left with
those people who have been brought up in the capi*
talist environment. They have had their experiences.
It has formed their character and personality. Nat*
urally, if you leave the babies and the children with
them, they will impress that character and person
ality upon them, so the Communists are confronted
with a problem of what to do with the adults of
established character and personality once they have
conquered the world.
Being thoroughly materialist scientists, they do
not hesitate. They say they have no alternative.
Naturally, they must dispose of these classes. To them
it is not murder. Murder is a bourgeois term which
means killing individuals for bad reasons. They are
going to kill classes for good reasons.
Mr. Arens. Is it your theme, Doctor, that the
practice of communism in the world is consistent
with the theory of communism?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. Inherent within the
theory of communism is the greatest program of
murder, slaughter, and insanity conceivable.
Mr. Arens. It is your theory that to the Commu
nis! mind the practice of communism and the theory
of communism are coextensive, that they comple*
ment one another?
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly.
Mr. Arens. What is your appraisal of the mur
der, deceit, and treachery which even the Communist
regimes assess against Stalin?
Dr. Schwarz. To the Communists murder,
treachery, and torture are frequently moral acts.
They cannot regenerate human nature until they
have destroyed the capitalist system. They cannot
destroy the capitalist system until they have con
quered the world.
Mr. Arens. What would be the mental processes by
which Khrushchev could condemn Stalin for murder?
Dr. Schwarz. He did not condemn him. He justified
him. In his speech on Stalin, that is the most amazing
feature. We say Khrushchev condemned him because we
read his report on Stalin's incredible acts and mental
attitudes. We pay no attention to Krushchev's climax. He
portrayed Stalin's acts which were the most fiendish, the
most brutal, the most evil in the record of man. He shows
Stalin as a multiple murderer. He shows him the mur
derer of millions. He shows him as sadistic and insane.
He shows him personally dictating the torture of his own
friends. He showed, for example, when the Jewish doc
tors were arrested and accused of poisoning Zhdanov,
Stalin called in their interrogator and said, "If you don't
get a confession, we will shorten you by a head." After he
portrayed the whole macabre spectacle, he finished up with
this statement, in effect: "Mind you, don't misunderstand.
Stalin was a good man. He did these things as a Marxist-
Leninist. He did these in the interest of the working class.
He was no giddy despot."
He finished up with a moral justification of Stalin.
That leads us to Communist morality. Morality is rela
tive and related to the objective situation.
You cannot regenerate mankind until you have de
stroyed the capitalist world, and you cannot destroy cap
italism until you have conquered the world. The process
of world conquest involves waging successfully the class
war. Within the present phase of the world struggle, at
the heart of existence, there is this universal war. As
Lenin stated, "Proletarian morality is determined by the
exigencies of the class struggle."
Mr. Arens. Could I interpose this question to
perhaps clarify our record: Khrushchev, as we all
know, had charge of the liquidation of the Kulak
class. About 10 million of his countrymen were
liquidated, what we would call murder. A crime of
such enormous scope that the average human mind
could not begin to comprehend it. In your appraisal
of the Communist philosophy and motivation in life,
could Khrushchev, as a dedicated Communist, have
a twinge of conscience about those murders?
Dr. Schwarz. None whatsoever.
Mr. Arens. Why, Doctor?
Dr. Schwarz. Because these murders were in the
interest of the advance of Communist power and
world conquest and in the direction of history's will;
therefore, they were moral and righteous acts. Any
twinge of conscience would be a remnant of Khrush
chev's bourgeois upbringing and a failure of his
Communist personality.
Mr. Arens. Could you give us a further word, Doc
tor, on this ideology of the Communists on the inevitability
of communizing the world?
Dr. Schwarz. Yes, sir. Their basic theoretical con
cept derives not from Stalin, not from Lenin, but from
Marx. The concept is the universality of class war. This
is their theoretical concept. War is a state of being. Wai
exists between the proletarian class, which is the future

class of mankind, and the reactionary bourgeois class. The
waging of this war is the great duty of all class-conscious
proletarians; the future is the triumph of the proletarian
class. Ihe Communist Party is the brain of the prole
tarian class, and the war that manifests itself within a state
is a conflict between the Communist Party and the state
government until the Communist Party destroys and con
quers that state. Once that is done, it manifests itself in
the international realm in a state of war between those
countries that have been conquered by the Communists and
where their power is established and those countries as yet
unconquered. The basis of Communist policy is the exist
ence of the class war. To them it is a fact of being.
So within this framework every act which advances
their triumph is righteous. Every statement that helps
their cause is true.
Mr. Arena. They overlooked the Christian phi
losophy.
Dr. Sehwarz. They wiped it out entirely.
Mr. Arens. The philosophy that the end never
justifies the means.
Dr. Sehwarz. The end creates the means. Any
act, however brutal, and no matter how many people
are killed, that advances the Communist conquest, is
a peaceful act.
Within this framework of ideology and morality, no
Communist can tell a lie in the interests of communism
because by definition, if it is in the interest of communism,
it is the truth. A person is only a material machine and
truth is merely a set of electronic impulses that circulate
within his brain. The ultimate truth is the will of the Com
munist Party. Every basic term that we use has been re
defined by the Communists in terms of the class war. For
example, as you well know the word "peace" is one of the
great words in the Communist vocabulary and most folks
think they are hypocrites when they use the word "peace."
Mr. Arens. Certain people in high places in gov*
ernment have professed that the Communist regime
in Soviet Russia wants peace.
Dr. Sehwarz. They do want it.
Mr. Arens. What kind of peace do they want?
Dr. Sehwarz. You have to understand that their
basic concept is that class war is a fact of being and
that peace is the historical synthesis when commu
nism defeats the remainder of the world and estab
lishes world Communist dictatorship, which is peace.
If you ask a true Communist to take a lie detector
test and ask him if he wants peace, he would past*
it with ease. He would look at you with a light in his
eye and say he longs for peace.
Mr. Weil. Communist peace, not peace as we
understand it.
Dr. Sehwarz. Every act that contributes to the
Communist conquest is a peaceful act. If they take
a gun, they take a peaceful gun, containing a peace
ful bullet, and kill you peacefully and put you in a
peaceful grave. When the Chinese Communists
murder millions, it is an act of peace. When the
Russian tanks rolled into Budapest to butcher and
destroy, it was glorious peace. Peace is wonderful
and within their framework of ideology whatever
helps their conquest is peaceful, good, and true.
Mr. Weil. I would like to ask one question of you
as a psychiatrist as well as an analyst of the Communist
ideology. There comes a point when all this re-evaluation
and redefinition has progressed to a point where it is no
longer reconcilable with reality, and even the Communists
themselves must recognize this. Have they not reached
that point ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I do not believe they have reached it.
They have reached the point of insanity.
Mr. Weil. You think Khrushchev still believes in the
classic theories as you expounded them ?
Dr. Sehwarz. I believe that paranoia is at the heart
of communism and that their theoretical concepts are far
more convincing to them than the evidence of the facts. I
believe, for example, that they, in their own mind, believe
that the riots in Hungary were organized by the vicious
American imperialists. There is this element of paranoiac
self-deception at the heart of communism. I do not think
that they are just hypocrites; they have merged the tech
niques of hypocrisy with the virtues of sincerity, creating
a very powerful instrument.
Mr. Weil. Mass paranoia itself is * term which can
be quite deceptive.
Dr. Sehwarz. It is a powerful instrument. That in
sanity is manifest in the world hysteria they stirred up
about the Rosenbergs. The Communists manifested their
tremendous efficiency as agitators around the world on
behalf of the Rosenbergs. The name "Rosenberg" became
the best-known American name throughout the world.
There were riots in many countries, and actually quite a
number of people died in these riots on behalf of the
Rosenbergs. Everywhere the Communists and their
friends were heart stricken and desperately miserable
because of the dreadful anti-Semitic conspiracy that was
leading to this cruel persecution of these two poor Rosen
bergs.
In the midst of it all, they suddenly arrested a lot of
their own leading Jews in Czechoslovakia, men of posi
tion, p>ower, and Communist character; and after a farce
of a trial, which occupied about 2 weeks, they publicly
executed them. The outsider looking on would say, "W hat
sort of people are these? How hypocritical can you be?"
The two Rosenbergs had been given a fair trial. The
trial was before a jury of their peers, conducted by an
impartial judge. Appeals were heard and every civil lib
erty granted that the fairest judicial system in the world
can provide. In Czechoslovakia, these Jews were practically
murdered after the most summary of judicial farces.
What hypocrisy! You would expect the Communists to
have at least some sense of guilt and inconsistency, but
there was no manifestation of it whatsoever. If anything,
their tears on behalf of the Rosenbergs flowed more freely.
Their agony became more intense. To us they were utter
hypocrites, but not to themselves. The execution of the
Rosenbergs was an act that would retard Communist
world conquest. Therefore, it was an evil act. Therefore,
the Rosenbergs were guiltless. Therefore, the evidence
against them was perjury. Therefore, those who gave the
evidence were perjurers and criminals. Therefore, every
progressive and moral proletarian heart must be emo
tionally disturbed because of this dreadful and evil act
perpetrated with cruelty, brutality, and injustice. On the
other hand, the arrest and execution of the Czechoslovak
Jews would advance Communist world conquest; it would
please the Arabs; it would set the stage for Communist
influence in the Near East, which we see coming to
fruition today.
It was an act in the interest of world conquest by
communism; therefore, it was a good act. Therefore, they
were guilty. Therefore, they were criminals. Therefore,
the evidence against them was true. Therefore, every pro
gressive heart must feel a sense of elation and rejoicing
that justice triumphed with their death.
Mr. Weil. I think the theory behind that is excellent.
But the evidence we have today seems to point to the fact
that the Communists wanted the Rosenbergs executed, as
a matter of fact, because they felt the Rosenbergs alive
might be witnesses against the Communist apparatus. That
bears out the impression of hypocrisy.
Dr. Schwarz. There is nothing inconsistent in their
moral framework of believing all that and wanting them
executed at the same time. There is nothing inconsistent
in that because each individual is merely an expendable
animal; and if their dying is going to help the Communist
cause, then it is a good act. They could want them exe
cuted and yet feel compassion for them and anger against
their brutal executioners. We have established that inher
ent within Communist ideology and morality there is a
program of murder, treachery, and brutality and that the
theory of communism translates these acts into highly
moral acts. The theory of communism destroys every
basic moral value on which civilization, and particularly
Christian civilization, is built.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, is there some kind of analogy
that could be made between what you are saying and
what your experience must have been as a surgeon,
namely, that a surgeon, as he undertakes to eliminate a
cancerous cell or organism of the body, cuts into noncan
cerous material and does it feeling he is doing so on per
fectly moral grounds because he is trying to save life? Is
that the approach that you are saying that Communists
have toward the ultimate goal of redemption of the world
by communism, that they can take lives, innocent lives,
because the over-all objective is one of saving humanity?
Dr. Schwarz. The tragedy of communism is not
•imply that it murders, but it transforms murder
into a moral and righteous act. When a person does
evil and he is conscious he is doing evil, you have
a basis of approach; but when evil becomes good,
you have no starting point, you have nothing about
which to argue. The great evil rests in the philo*
sophic, basic concepts of communism when it rejects
God, when it materialize* and bestializes man, and
when it denies the inherent dignity and value of
human personality and individuality. Upon that
ruthless, amoral, materialistic basis it builds an edi*
fice which destroys evermore every civilized, moral,
ethical, and spiritual value.
Mr. Arens. Before we get to the second side of your
coin, you have told us, first of all, on the basis of your
background experience and study, the ideology and moral
ity of communism, and you propose to tell us, as I under
stand it, how to meet and defeat this ideology of com
munism.
Before we get to the second side of the coin, could
I ask you a question or two, if you please, Doctor?
How do you account for the fact that this
ideology of communism, which is contrary to all
that you and I as Christians — and I say it in the
broadest term — people who believe in God and be
lieve in spiritual values, how do you account for the
fact that this force called communism, evil as it is,
unappealing as it is to those with any sense in them
of goodness, is sweeping across the world with a
speed that is hitherto unknown in the history of the
world, that it now encompasses about one-third of
the population of the world from a start of about
50 years ago? How do you account for that?
Dr. Schwarz. First, the reason is their recruit*
ment of the student intellectual, who is susceptible
to the appeals of communism by reason of his edu
cational conditioning. He accepts that materialist
foundation on which Communist ideology and moral
ity is built. He is recruited in terms of his ideological
pride. He is more intelligent than the average man,
and be sees the opportunity to mold man and create
history, whereas the dull, brutal driven herd sweeps
on unaware of the forces that create it and drive
it forward. He is one of the elite, the chosen, and
the intellectual aristocracy. In combination with this
iutellectual pride, the religious nature of man de
mands a purpose in life; they find in this vision of
human regeneration a religious refuge for their
Godless hearts.
Second, th«re is their superb organization. The origin
of effective communism came with totalitarian organiza
tion, the formation of the Bolshevik segment of the Rus
sian Democratic Labor Party under Lenin. Communism
illustrates the truth that the disciplined, dedicated, scien
tific, intelligent, and organized few will be able to exploit
and direct, deceive, and conquer the selfish, undisciplined,
disorganized multitudes. Communism is advancing in

terms of its recruitment of students, the organization of
these students into the Communist Party and the scien
tific exploitation of group needs, grievances and ambi
tions to advance their party to power. The goal of commu
nism is conquest, not conversion. They convert a few and
conquer the many.
Mr. Arena. It is our information, Doctor, that
there are in the world today approximately 25 mil'
lion Communists. Is there any cohesive force that
is opposing them?
Dr. Schwarz. Unfortunately, no.
Mr. Arens. Is there any monolithic force of any
comparable size?
Dr. Schwarz. Uunfortunately, I know of none. I
know of no monolithic, conscious, dedicated, directive
force to oppose them. What is needed, and that brings
us to a second point —
Mr. Arens. I would like to ask you, before you get
to your second point, if there is a fallacy in undertaking
to appraise the strength of the world Communist move
ment in terms of numbers?
Dr. Schwarz. A very definite fallacy involved.
Mr. Arens. Why?
Dr. Schwarz. Because it is trying to determine the
validity of the hull of the boat by relating the area of
the holes to the area which is sound. One hole can sink
the ship. Communism is the theory of the disciplined few
controlling and directing the rest. One person in a sensi
tive position can control, manipulate, and if necessary,
destroy thousands of others.
Mr. Arens. To use this illustration of your boat, you
need only one man to pilot the wheel.
Dr. Schwarz. That is right. If he wants to run it
aground, the fact that the other thousand people want to
keep it at sea has little bearing on the result. Lenin's
slogan was fewer but better; the dedicated, disciplined,
who will conquer and control the great multitude.
Mr. Arens. Doctor, on the basis of your extensive
study of communism, is it conceivable that we can nego
tiate ourselves out of the struggle, negotiate with the
Soviets, the international Soviet operation?
Dr. Schwarz. To negotiate true peace with people
who are utterly dedicated to the concept of the historical
inevitability of class war and their victory is impossible.
To think that we can do it is to indicate a failure to
understand communism so completely that it approaches
mental illness. To the Communist every negotiation is an
act of war. Every delegation is an act of war. Every peace
petition is an act of war. Every disarmament conference
is an act of war.
Mr. Arens. Could we trust them in negotiating with
them in a disarmament conference?
Dr. Schwarz. As long as keeping their promise
would advance their program of conquest, they could be
trusted to keep it. The moment that keeping their promise
hindered their program of world conquest, it would be
their moral and righteous duty to break it. Actually, crazy
as it sounds, to them, breaking their promise would be
keeping it.

Mr. Arens. Doctor, with this record reflecting your
comments on the ideology and morality of communism,
we would be very happy to have you proceed to give us
your views on how the free world can meet and defeat
the ideology of communism.
Dr. Schwarz. The first step of Communist conquest
is the ideological conquest of the student mind. That is
always the first step. Our first step should be the immu
nization of the student mind against that conquest by
the Communists.
The Communists have never been able to make
progress until they have been able to get these stu
dent intellectuals to be their standard bea>°rs. This
poses a problem both within and without the coun
try. Within the country the educational system, the
legislative system, the family, the religion, and all
cultural influences should be so tuned that they
build a mind and a character with an understanding
of the American heritage and moral values; a con
fidence in your constitutional system, your govern
ment by law, your economic systems of free com
petitive enterprise. Associated with this understand
ing, there should be a national patriotism that will
immunize the youth against the very insidious Com
munist propaganda.
The first thing is to educate young people who
believe in their God, their country, their family, their
Constitution, their liberty under law and who are
proud of their heritage. They then will no! easily be
swayed by Godless, materialistic concepts.
Mr. Arens. May I pose a question as this point,
Doctor: Have not the Communists even perverted these
institutions, such as loyalty to Government, such as the
true tenets and principles of the Constitution?
I know when this committee has hearings in which
we subpena before us people who are identified under
oath as hard-core members of the Communist conspiracy,
they very cleverly attack the committee as though we are
the ones out to destroy the Constitution, as though they
are the ones who are defending the Constitution by in
voking the fifth amendment, and they have a significant
segment of the so-called liberals of the country who go
right down the line with thrm.
Dr. Schwarz. Exactly. This is the paradox. Here
are our very precious, cherished liberties that did
not come about by accident, that are the envy and
admiration of the rest of the world; here is a group
of people, the Communists, openly dedicated to their
total destruction and yet these Communists are able
to take advantage of these very liberties and to hide
behind these liberties for their purposes of destruc
tion and to recruit as their "runners of interference"
well meaning American citizens. This is the para

dox thai confronts us. The problem is, and I know
this in a problem that confronts your committee all
the time, how can we rout them out, expose and dis
arm them without doing damage to the constitutional
system and liberty under law which are so cherished
in America? I believe it can be done, it must be done;
and it is being done.
Mr. Arens. I would like to have you elaborate, if
you please, sir, on the way in which, in your judgment,
the ideology and morality of communism can be exposed
for what it is, the fallacies of it actually exposed and how
to actually meet it with a superior and more sound
ideology.
Dr. Schwarz. I believe that the problem is largely
an educational one, but it is also a spiritual one.
If I may say so, I think your committee has done
a magnificent educational job. I do not know if that
is the prime function of your committee, but you have
certainly done a splendid educational job in revealing not
only the theory but the actual practice and character of
communism and Communists.
I believe that communism should be taught in
the educational system, but I believe it should be
taught with a moral directive, in the same way that
a medical student is taught that cancer is evil, that
tuberculosis is evil and education about them is
directed to their elimination and defeat. I think the
teaching of communism without a moral directive
can be very dangerous. Teaching it with a moral
directive, should emphasize the basic foundations of
American civilization, revealing the enemy threaten
ing their destruction, the erroneous beliefs leading
the Communists to undertake the destruction of free
dom, the methods by which they propose to destroy,
and what must be done to defeat them. If it is pre
sented without moral direction, it appears simply as
an alternative economic system with certain superior
virtues. This has frequently been done in the past
and instead of opposing communism, it tends to
recruit to communism.
I believe there is a great problem before the
American peoplet to provide education with a moral
dynamic that reveals communism as a rationale of
murder and lying and the destruction of freedom.
It is totally immoral, and mental and emotional bar
riers against it should be erected in the minds of the
young.
Then there is also the problem of what is to be done
throughout the world, because communism is advancing
by a pincers movement. It is advancing by internal de
ception, confusion, misrepresentation and weakening and
external growth of power. They believe that by a com
bination of the internal confusion and degeneracy, in com
bination with the growth of the external threat, the final
act of conflict can be consummated without war and their
violence can follow later.
Mr. Arens. Do you remember the quotation from
Lenin on that, that they will encircle the United States
and it will fall in the hands of the Communists like an
overripened fruit?
Dr. Schwarz. That is their program. The tragedy
of our approach to the Communist danger throughout
the world is that it is almost entirely on a materialistic
plane that we are trying to defeat them.
Here is the great paradox. The Communists profess
themselves to be materialists, and we profess ourselves
to be idealists and spiritual people. As a consequence of
these beliefs, the Communists are winning the world by
first winning the students ideoligically, while we try to
combat them by material means. Basically the program,
at least if you look at it budgetwise, is about $40 billion
approximately for military weapons, then about $3 billion
to $4 billion for material assistance, and a tiny fragment
for purposes of information, education, and spiritual war
fare.
The paradox is this: Basically, much of our program
to combat communism rests on a Marxist foundation.
Marxism teaches that the ideas of the mind, as well as
the emotions of the heart, emerge out of the material
environment.
When we want people of the world to resist the
Communist idea and to embrace the idea of freedom,
we think that if we give them material benefits this
will automatically come to pass, and so the idea is
to give economic aid and military assistance in the
expectation that communism will lose its appeal and
freedom will triumph.
The foundation is wrong. Materialistic meas
ures do not control the minds and the hearts of the
people. This must be done in a more direct fashion.
We need a scientific approach that will utilize the
moral, cultural, and spiritual values in each of these
countries. We need a loving, friendly, co-operative
spirit and a direct approach to their minds and
hearts to mobilize them against communism.
Let us consider Tndia. The Communists want India.
If they conquer Tndia the consequences are incalculable.
The average Indian must have a reason for being against
communism. What reason is significant to him? You
cannot say it is against his economic well-being. His
economic well-being is so low that it is difficult to make
it any lower. You cannot say it is against his constitu
tional liberties. He does not quite understand what they
are. It must be against something which to him is mean
ingful and significant, it must threaten something to him
that is valuable. The Communists very cleverly deceive
and hide their destructive program from each group as
they exploit their nerds and conquer them.
There are certain forces which, properly organized,
will mobilize the people against communism. To the
Indian his religious faith, whether it be Hindu, Moslem,
or Christianity, is important. His family relationship is
important. His moral code is important. His national
aspirations are important. Communism is against all these

things; but in its approach to the Indian, it appears to be
favorable to them.
I am informed by Indians that the majority of
Christians in India vote Communist. The reason they
vote Communist is not because they approve of Commu
nist theories, they haven't the faintest idea what they
are. They vote Communist because the Communists sent
a very fine young student to their village with glorious
magazines showing them how much their life will be
improved under communism.
Mr. Weil. What do we do; send more magazines?
Dr. Schwarz. Not so fast. First the Communists
had to win the student who takes the magazines. We need
an ideological offensive. That is what I am trying to do.
I am an evangelical Christian and there are evangelical
Christians in India. We have a basis of fellowship. Com
munism threatens us both. By personal association and
contact we can build the understanding of the Communist
danger. We have the tools that can help them convey the
message to other Christians and the Indian people. It is
much better that they should do it. We can help them.
Our material advantage can now be effectively used when
dedicated freedom-loving people, encouraged by our love,
equipped by our support, carry the message of the value
of the individual and the spiritual heritage of man, inter
preted in the light of their specific faith, motivated by
ie dynamics of their conviction, when they carry this
message and the corollary of the Communist threat to their
own nationals.
Mr. Arens. On the basis of your worldwide tours,
background and experience, what is your appraisal of
the progress of internal communism as opposed to the
forces of freedom at the present time?
Dr. Schwarz. I regret to say that, by every standard
test, the Communists have been making terrifying prog
ress ; and they are winning and we are losing.
Also in regard to your question, I think that the
lollowing illustration may be significant: Recently, for
the first time, I saw the mechanical brain, the Univac
machine. The firm was quite a small firm and yet to them
it was so important that they paid $1,000 a month rental
for it. They explained to me its purpose: They fed into it
the statistics of the past, and the machine analyzed them
and then predicted future trends. These trends were so
accurate that they formed the foundation for their policy.
I said to the president of the firm, "Let us feed in
the statistics of Communist advances of the past 50 years
and see what year the Univac predicts the Communists
w ! * conquer the world. Lenin established Bolshevikism
linrvrv! su PP orters m He conquered Russia with
40,000 supporters in 1917, and today they have conquered
m< vi e «^ an million." The president of the companv
said, lam afraid to try it."
The Communists claim victory is certain for. the
following reasons: They say it is inevitable, because we
are the producf of our own environment which has created
us so intellectually dishonest, so unwilling to face the
evidence, so selfish, so greedy, and so intoxicated with
entertainment that we will never have the honesty, the
intelligence, the courage, or the dedication necessary to do
what must be done if we are to survive.
Mr. eil. What must be done If we are to
survive?
Dr. Schwarz. We must face honestly the gravity
°/. , ? Bitua t>°n. We must give it priority in our
thinking and in our actions. We must build a strong
base of freedom-loving people articulate in their
faith, in their love of country, in their love of God,
in their love of home, and in their love of law, and
we must rally the spiritual forces in the heart of man
and recruit dedicated personnel to raise harriers
against communism in every area of the world.
The fundamental foundation of opposition to
communism is an informed public opinion and a
dedicated public character. On these alone the neces
sary legislative, administrative, judicial, military, and
economic and education programs may be built.
We have to set to work urgently building the
foundation for Communist defeat. Most of our pres
ent program, such as the military program and eco
nomic program, are temporary measures which may
hold back the flood for a short period and give us
a little more time to find a permanent solution.
In conclusion may I say that assessing all the evi
dence on a worldwide scope the Communists' continuing
advance is terrifying, and the possibility of the fulfillment
of Khrushchev's boast, " We'll bury you," looms closer
every day.
Mr. Weil. If the present rate of Communist ad
vances continues, how long do you think it will be,
in your analysis of world events, before the Com
munists take complete control of the world?
Dr. Schwarz. I think the Communists have
more orjess tentatively set the deadline for about the
year 1973. Mao-Tse-tung and Stalin in their last con
ference thought it would take 4 more 5-year plans,
approximately 10 years for the conquest and consol
idation of Asia, with the immediate threat to Africa
and Europe, while the weakening, softening, and de
generation of America continues, and avoiding an
atomic-hydrogen war, their conquest is contemplated
about that time.
Mr. Weil. You mean 10 years from now for the
consolidation of Asia, and this program does not envision
a hydrogen bomb war ?
Dr. Schwarz. The basic Communist strategy in 1952
renounced the inevitability of world war 111. World con
quest without war, which is called co-existence, became
their basic strategy. I would not be surprised that they
would like some disarmament, as all they look to from
military might is a stalemate. If they can reduce the
armament burden and retain this stalemate, they will
have more funds available for propaganda, and political
and economic warfare.
Mr. Arens. Thank you very much, Doctor. We
deeply appreciate your contribution in this staff inter
rogation.
(Thereupon, at 4:15 p.m., Wednesday, May 29, 1957,
the consultation was concluded.)
