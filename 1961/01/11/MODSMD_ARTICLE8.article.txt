### 
ATHENS. Ga. (UPI)- Georgia
lost two court decision's yester
i day that would have forestalled
federally-ordered integration at
! the University of Georgia and the
: two Negro students who broke
down the school's 175-year tradi
tion of segregation promptly re
ported for classes.
Charlayne Hunter, 18, and Ham
ilton Holmes, 19. were sneaked
into the tree-lined campus through
the hack door of the academic
building while an estimated 2.000
students and townsfolk gathered
at the various entrances to the
! school.
THESUPIIKMK Court in Wash
: ington refused a request to delay
; the integration until the case
could be appealed, and a Federal
I judge at Macon, Ga., barred the
' state from cutting off funds to
i the university.
But the Speaker of the Georgia
â–  House of Representatives said
last night in Atlanta that state
: funds to tlie School of Journalism
and College of Arts and Sciences
| had been cut off despite the Fed
-1 eral Court order.
George L. Smith said only Gov.
Ernest Vandiver and State Audi
' tor B. E. Thrasher Jr. were
named in the injunction. Other
j state officials could .still keep the
; money from the school.
Negro coed Charlayne Hunter
was treated last night to a rowdy
j reception on her first night in a
dormitory.
AX ESTIMATED 2,000 students
I rolled in waves across lawns and
' streets in front of Myers Hall.
Dick Goss, an Atlanta television
cameraman, was struck in the
1 mouth by a rock and unidentified
persons in the crowd snatched his
| $850 camera and made off with it.
At least two students were ar
rested.
i Dean of Men William Tate was
' approached by about 20 male
! students who wanted to argue
about admission of the Negroes.
He told them calmly:
"This is not what we wanted
but it is what we have and we
j must bo men enough to make the
best of it.
