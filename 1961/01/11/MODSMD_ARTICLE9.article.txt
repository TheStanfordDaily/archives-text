### GREGG HOPKINS 
President J. Wallace Sterling
called for a "still higher degree
of high grade individual respon
sibility" at Stanford and through
the nation to preserve and further
freedom in the world, yesterday
in his Stanford Today and Tomor
row speech.
"Hot war," he said to a capacity
audience, ". . . evokes commit- |
ment, heroism and sacrifice to a
degree unmatched by any other
act in which man engages." Dur
ing the cold war, however, stimu- i
lation of such "commitment, hero
ism and sacrifice" is much more
difficult. "The next decade will
be one of grave Irial for the
world, for the United States and
for education.
"THE CASE for freedom can

be made only in terms of personal
responsibility," Sterling said, urg
ing Stanford students to appreci
ate their good fortune and make
maximum use of their intelligence
and ability.
In telling how Stanford came to
receive the Ford Foundation
award he stressed the importance
of the Ford Foundation's favor
able impression of Stanford's
present status and the realistic
detailed estimate of future needs
for the 60's, prepared in 1939 by
the faculty and administration.
THE I OKI) program is de
signed to encourage certain
"peaks of excellence" throughout
the country; Stanford was chosen
as one of five such universities
and has the opportunity or re
ceiving the largest award of the
five. $25 million. The grant will
match with one dollar every three
dollars which Stanford can raise.
This "largest gift ever made to
a university" will call for the
"greatest effort Stanford has over
made to improve herself," Ster
ling said. "Sixty per cent of the
funds raised will go to support
the people and programs involved
in learning, teaching and investi
gating."
STERLING CITEI) major re
habilitation of existing facilities,
plus development of other neces
sary capital improvements -such
| as dormitories and an undergrad
uate library as the probable des
tination of 40 per cent of the Ford
money. "One could wish that cap
ital needs were less," he said, but
Stanford's plant is still inade
quate for an enrollment which
doubled in the 1.940'5, and which
still has "much catching up to
do."
STERLING went on to predict
that the Federal Government will
take over a greater share of the
cost of educating the increasing
number of students and under
taking special research and train
ing. He anticipates that more will
be done in high schools to make
distinctions between those stu
dents qualified for college prepa
aration and those not. and that
there will be an increase in the
number and size of junior col
leges and technical schools.
STERLING urged students lo
take advantage of their ST&T dis
cussion groups to determine Stan
lord's present strength by obtain
ing comparisons "between Stan
ford at one point in history and
Stanford at a subsequent point."
He added that Stanford's progress
in the past six years, plus her
j proven capacity to tap sources of
j additional financial support were
selling points in convincing the
Ford Foundation to give Stanford
the grant.
Sterling was introduced by
Stanford Today and Tomorrow
Committee Chairman Bob Sayler,
who called ST&T a program to
create closer contact between stu
dent opinion and administration
and faculty opinion, with an em
phasis on a warmer, more per
sonal relationship than before
through living group discussions
which provide students with an
informal, close-range forum in
which to hear and voice opinions
concerning the future of the Uni
versity.
