associated with aviation's growing years and great hours. But today, Chance Vought has expanded beyond its
traditional field into other market areas, both military and industrial. The Aeronautics Division, which supplies
the new all-weather Crusader to the Navy and is at work on other aircraft and missile projects, is also
headquarters for a company-wide anti-submarine effort • The Astronautics Division — deep into studies for
manned space flight — is prime vehicle contractor for the NASA Scout and a key contractor on the Air Force
Blue Scout Junior, both research rockets • An aggressive Electronics Division supplies components and
systems to major U. S. defense and research programs • Vought Range Systems is a world-wide service
organization with space-tracking, range instrumentation and many other responsibilities • Vought Research
Center feeds basic knowledge to all divisions • A subsidiary — Vought Industries, Inc.— is the nation's
leading producer of mobile homes • Another subsidiary — Information Systems, Inc. — produces industrial
automation and process control equipment • National Data Processing Corporation, in which Chance Vought
owns a majority interest, specializes in business data processing equipment, particularly in the banking field.
