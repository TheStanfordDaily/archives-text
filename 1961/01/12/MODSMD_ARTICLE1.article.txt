## 
### 
ATHENS, Ga. < UPI > Two Negro students were suspended
from the University of Georgia "for their own safety" last night
ifter student demonstrators engaged in a rock-throwing melee with
police.
The action was taken by Dean of Students Joseph A. Williams, who
lotified Universilv President Dr. O. C. Aderhold. The State Highway

Patrol was ordered to pick ihe
Negroes up at the campus and
, return them to Atlanta.
"The action was taken for their
i safety and that of other students
on the campus." Dr. Aderhold
said.
Earlier, police and student riot
I els tangled in a wild demonstra
tion which was put down by
| squads of police.
Officers finally used tear gas
and fire hoses to break up the
demonstration by hundreds of stu
•l dents and some adults. Two shots
were fired by one policeman in an
! effort to quell the rioting.
A number of students were ar
; rested and several newsmen were
struck by rocks tossed by the
j milling students. One policeman
was injured and rushed to a local
hospital.
The demonstration came after
two Negro student-s a boy and
1 a girl had become the first mem
! bers of their race to attend the
state school. Their attendance at
j classes today was orderly and
' there had been no demonstrations.
Tin; TEAK <»AS bombs were
dropped in front of the girl's dor
mitory when it appeared the
demonstration was getting out of
hand. White clouds of smoke
slowly rose in the still night air,
causing the crowd estimated in
the hundreds to withdraw
coughing and rubbing their eyes
; from the stinging gas.
The outbreak occurred after a
spirited basketball game between
the university and intra-state ri
val Georgia Tech of Atlanta. Tech
won the contest, 89-80, in over
lime after ticing the score in the
last seconds of play.
The students then spilled into
the streets and headed for the
dormitory where Miss Hunter is
residing. The Negro girl had at
tended her first classes yesterday
without incident.
THE SHOUTING, rock-throw
ing students forced school offi
cials to place an emergency call
to the state patrol for assistance.
Several of the demonstrators
carried a large white sheet on
which the words "nigger go
home" were painted. A number
of cars occupied by white adults
were parked along the street Hear
ing the girl's dormitory. Some of
the adults quickly joined the stu
dents in their protest over the
school's court-ordered integration.
The admission to the school
yesterday of Miss Hunter, 18. and
Hamilton Holmes, 11), ended 175
years of segregation at the slate
; school.
The vanguard of demonstrators
I left the basketball game and raced
toward Myers Hall, where Miss
Hunter lives, and began hurling
rocks at the windows,
THE CROWD, which was rela
tively small at the beginning of
the demonstration, quickly grew
i in number.
A number of Athens policemen
j had been standing by near the
dormitory, but it soon became ap
; parent that they could no longer
i cope with the rapidly developing
demonstration.
Police were soon hauling stu
dents to parked patrol wagons
and taking them off to headquar
ters.
A MAN who identified himself
to United Press International as
J. L. Bra/.leton. the mayor of Bra
i zleton, Georgia, told the students
who were arrested he would per
sonally go on their bonds.
"I will pay your bonds, all of
' them," Bra/.leton said.
The whine of police sirens dis
couraged some of the demonstra
tors but the crowd kept swelling.
Heavy wire screens at the dor
mitory protected windows in the
building from the barrage of
rocks. One rock pierced a screen,
however, and smashed through a
window.
The rioting shattered what had
been a day of relative calm in this
tiny college community.

Earlier, police and student riot
I els tangled in a wild demonstra

| squads of police.
Officers finally used tear gas
and fire hoses to break up the
demonstration by hundreds of stu
•l dents and some adults. Two shots
were fired by one policeman in an
! effort to quell the rioting.
A number of students were ar
; rested and several newsmen were
struck by rocks tossed by the
j milling students. One policeman
was injured and rushed to a local
hospital.
The demonstration came after
two Negro student-s a boy and
1 a girl had become the first mem
! bers of their race to attend the
state school. Their attendance at
j classes today was orderly and
' there had been no demonstrations.
Tin; TEAK <»AS bombs were
dropped in front of the girl's dor
mitory when it appeared the
demonstration was getting out of
hand. White clouds of smoke
slowly rose in the still night air,
causing the crowd estimated in
the hundreds to withdraw
coughing and rubbing their eyes
; from the stinging gas.
The outbreak occurred after a
spirited basketball game between
the university and intra-state ri
val Georgia Tech of Atlanta. Tech
won the contest, 89-80, in over
lime after ticing the score in the
last seconds of play.
The students then spilled into
the streets and headed for the
dormitory where Miss Hunter is
residing. The Negro girl had at
tended her first classes yesterday
without incident.
THE SHOUTING, rock-throw
ing students forced school offi
cials to place an emergency call
to the state patrol for assistance.
Several of the demonstrators
carried a large white sheet on
which the words "nigger go
home" were painted. A number
of cars occupied by white adults
were parked along the street Hear
ing the girl's dormitory. Some of
the adults quickly joined the stu
dents in their protest over the
school's court-ordered integration.
The admission to the school
yesterday of Miss Hunter, 18. and
Hamilton Holmes, 11), ended 175
years of segregation at the slate
; school.
