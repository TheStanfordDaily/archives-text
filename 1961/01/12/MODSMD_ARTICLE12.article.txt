There have been, as everyone
knows, some feelers from Moscow
looking toward a resumption of
diplomatic intercourse. For all
practical purposes there has been
none since last May. Mr. Khrush
chev appears to want it to be
thought here lhat the break after
the U-2 affair was a personal
quarrel with President Eisenhow
er; this quarrel would automati
cally be laid aside with the inaug
uration of Mr. Kennedy.
The U-2 quarrel can be laid
aside. But it does not follow that
President Eisenhower's venture
in personal diplomacy can be re
sumed. The question now is not
how soon a personal meeting at
the summit can be brought about.
The fiasco last year, which ended
in Paris but did not begin there,
has taught us a lesson. If the kind
of understanding which the world
so badly needs is to become pos
sible, it cannot be had with
out far deeper study and prepa
ration than have as yet been given
to the problem. We know now
that had Eisenhower and Khrush
chev met at the summit in May,
they would have been grossly un
prepared to go beyond generali
ties.
This labor of study aiul prepa
ration makes It necessary to re
sort to quiet diplomacy and to
stay away from spectacular ac
tions. Thus last week Mr. Ken
nedy denied the report that he
was planning' to send a special
envoy, presumably Mr. Averell
Harrimann, to Moscow to talk
with Mr. Khrushchev. Obviously,
he is quite aware that this would
have messed up everything. It
would have c onf i r in e d Mr.
Khrushchev in his predilection for
abnormal diplomatic, procedure
and in a most spectacular way
it would have downgraded our
Ambassador in Moscow.
What the Kennedy administra
tion needs if it is to have time
for study and preparation is to
upgrade the American ambassa
dor in Moscow and the Soviet
Ambassador in Washington. It is
necessary to resume the diplo
matic intercourse which was sus

pended last May. But it is unde
sirable and impossible to go back
to Eisenhower's summitry. It fol
lows that the two countries must ;
cultivate the habit of talking to!
each other through their embas
sies. These can, of course, be sup
plemented by unofficial meetings
of experts like the ones held re
cently at Dartmouth and in Mos
cow.
The great task of quiet diplo
macy is to work out ways and 1
means of keeping the critical
questions—Laos, the Congo, Al
geria, Cuba—from reaching the
point of irreparable decision. In
these critical places we are par
ticularly involved in Laos and in
Cuba, and in both places our im
mediate objective must be to
avoid a sudden showdown.
It sounds brave and dashing to
say that we must take the lead
and act. decisively to solve the
problems of Laos and of Cuba.
But the fact is that these prob
lems are in the present state of
the world insoluble. There is no
conceivable way in which Laos,
which has two Communist states
on its frontiers, which is a coun
try of trackless jungles, can be
made finally secure against infil
tration and guerrilla fighting. We
cannot seal off Laos from thel
Communist states which it touch-!
es. And there is no conceivable j
way in which we can deal with
Castro except to contain him |
gradually with the growing col-;
i laboration of the other American
i.states. We cannot exercise thel
revolutionary spirit of Fidelism. j
By open diplomacy, which only
too often means loudmouthed
diplomacy, we can do little to
assuage, indeed much to exacer-
I bale these crises. For then one
side or the other has to back down
if there is to be any accommoda
tion. Hut in qui e t diplomacy,
there is no loss of face if a coun
try backs away from an extreme
position which has proved to l>e
untenable.

acy is for the time being the hope !

There have been, as everyone
knows, some feelers from Moscow
looking toward a resumption of
diplomatic intercourse. For all
practical purposes there has been
none since last May. Mr. Khrush
chev appears to want it to be
thought here lhat the break after
the U-2 affair was a personal
quarrel with President Eisenhow
er; this quarrel would automati
cally be laid aside with the inaug
uration of Mr. Kennedy.
The U-2 quarrel can be laid
aside. But it does not follow that
President Eisenhower's venture
in personal diplomacy can be re
sumed. The question now is not
how soon a personal meeting at
the summit can be brought about.
The fiasco last year, which ended
in Paris but did not begin there,
has taught us a lesson. If the kind
of understanding which the world
so badly needs is to become pos
sible, it cannot be had with
out far deeper study and prepa
ration than have as yet been given
to the problem. We know now
that had Eisenhower and Khrush
chev met at the summit in May,
they would have been grossly un
prepared to go beyond generali
ties.
This labor of study aiul prepa
ration makes It necessary to re
sort to quiet diplomacy and to
stay away from spectacular ac
tions. Thus last week Mr. Ken
nedy denied the report that he
was planning' to send a special
envoy, presumably Mr. Averell
Harrimann, to Moscow to talk
with Mr. Khrushchev. Obviously,
he is quite aware that this would
have messed up everything. It
would have c onf i r in e d Mr.
Khrushchev in his predilection for
abnormal diplomatic, procedure
and in a most spectacular way
it would have downgraded our
Ambassador in Moscow.
What the Kennedy administra
tion needs if it is to have time
for study and preparation is to
upgrade the American ambassa
dor in Moscow and the Soviet
Ambassador in Washington. It is
necessary to resume the diplo
matic intercourse which was sus

pended last May. But it is unde
sirable and impossible to go back
to Eisenhower's summitry. It fol
lows that the two countries must ;
cultivate the habit of talking to!
each other through their embas
sies. These can, of course, be sup
plemented by unofficial meetings
of experts like the ones held re
cently at Dartmouth and in Mos
cow.
The great task of quiet diplo
macy is to work out ways and 1
means of keeping the critical
questions—Laos, the Congo, Al
geria, Cuba—from reaching the
point of irreparable decision. In
these critical places we are par
ticularly involved in Laos and in
Cuba, and in both places our im
mediate objective must be to
avoid a sudden showdown.
It sounds brave and dashing to
say that we must take the lead
and act. decisively to solve the
problems of Laos and of Cuba.
But the fact is that these prob
lems are in the present state of
the world insoluble. There is no
conceivable way in which Laos,
which has two Communist states
on its frontiers, which is a coun
try of trackless jungles, can be
made finally secure against infil
tration and guerrilla fighting. We
cannot seal off Laos from thel
Communist states which it touch-!

sies. These can, of course, be sup
plemented by unofficial meetings
of experts like the ones held re
cently at Dartmouth and in Mos
cow.
The great task of quiet diplo
macy is to work out ways and 1
means of keeping the critical
questions—Laos, the Congo, Al
geria, Cuba—from reaching the
point of irreparable decision. In
these critical places we are par
ticularly involved in Laos and in
Cuba, and in both places our im
mediate objective must be to
avoid a sudden showdown.
It sounds brave and dashing to
say that we must take the lead
and act. decisively to solve the
problems of Laos and of Cuba.
But the fact is that these prob
lems are in the present state of
the world insoluble. There is no
conceivable way in which Laos,
which has two Communist states
on its frontiers, which is a coun
try of trackless jungles, can be
made finally secure against infil
tration and guerrilla fighting. We
cannot seal off Laos from thel
Communist states which it touch-!
es. And there is no conceivable j
way in which we can deal with
Castro except to contain him |
gradually with the growing col-;
i laboration of the other American
i.states. We cannot exercise thel
revolutionary spirit of Fidelism. j
By open diplomacy, which only
too often means loudmouthed
diplomacy, we can do little to
assuage, indeed much to exacer-
I bale these crises. For then one
side or the other has to back down
if there is to be any accommoda
tion. Hut in qui e t diplomacy,
there is no loss of face if a coun
try backs away from an extreme
position which has proved to l>e
untenable.
For this reason, quiet diplom
acy is for the time being the hope !
of the world.
