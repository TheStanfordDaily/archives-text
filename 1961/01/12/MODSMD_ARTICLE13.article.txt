## Why Ignored?

(Editor's nolo: This is the first
in a series of articles on Dinkel
spiel Auditorium by Associate
Editor Mary Lou McKinley.)
To most persons on campus,
Dinkelspiel Auditorium is a place
for Civ exams, humanities lec
tures and Tuesday Evening Series
talks, orchestra rehearsals and
chorale programs. Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium is much more than this,
however, or should be.
In short, it is one of the newest
and most experimental theater
buildings in the United States. As
such it holds great possibilities
for exciting work in the fields of
both experimental theater and
opera. It was designed as a thea
ter of the future, and with this
structure on its campus Stanford
University could well become a
leader in progressive theater and
music.
But this will be possible only
when the building' is utilized for
the purpose for which it was in
tended â€”a purpose which is con
cerned not with conventional ideas
but new conceptions in the wide
area of theater.
While professional firms exe
cuted the architectural design
after William L. Crosten, head of
the Music Department, defined
the requirements of the building,
the inspiration for the design
came from Arch Lauterer who
acted as consultant on the plan
ning-
Speaking of his concept of the
auditorium by putting it into the
larger context of today's theater,
Lauterer said:
"New theaters must be planned
differently than those now exist
ing if they are to serve dramatic
art in our time. The need is great
and obvious, for our theater is
failing to contribute to our cul
ture as an art. and failing finan
cially as a craft. It has become
impoverished, and it can no longer
compete in paying for the skills
it requires for quality produc
tions."
Lauterer looked forward "to
a new theater trend that will
make possible a style for a Twen

tieth Century dramatic 1 healer."
And one of the ways to achieve
this was, he said, by designing
"theaters that result from, first
of all. seeing actors, not scenery,
on the stage."
"Light, not paint, is undoubt
i odly the essential distinguishing
medium of theater in this cen
j tury." Lauterer wanted to get
away from the opaque, box-like
j stage of the Fifteenth Century.
I Dinkelspiel was the fulfillment of
j this wish, and of the building,
I Lauterer said:
"In this theater we are not at
tempting to present pictures. We
are trying to create dramatic
images out of movement. Actors
will move in relation to one an
other, rather than in relation to
the scenery."
With this in mind, this stage
designer, dance-dramatist, direc
tor, technician and professor de
signed a 56-foot stage, to be
lighted from every angle by light
ing equipment concealed in a loft
at the back of the auditorium.
There was no need of space for
costly scenery-flying equipment
|in Lauterer's conception of the
; modern theater. Therefore, the
towering stage loft was elimi
nated, with the stage ceiling being
a continuation of the auditorium
ceiling.
Likewise, there was no need of
a backstage area to store picture
i frame scenery and flats. To insure
| theater intimacy and contact be
tween audience and players, the
wide stage was curved out into
the 728-seat auditorium.
Why, then, have the building's
marvelous facilities been largely
ignored? One reason is that Lau
| terer died before the building was
'completed and before the official
dedication and first musical per
i formance took place there on
i May 23, 1957.
This question will be discussed
| more thoroughly in following
columns, as will more of Lau
terer's ideas and possible solu
tions offered by both the Depart
ment of Music and Depart ment of
Speech and Drama.
