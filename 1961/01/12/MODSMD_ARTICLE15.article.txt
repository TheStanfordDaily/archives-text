Editor, The Daily:
I am particularly concerned
with the ignorance displayed in
regard to ihe etiquette of speech
and address by what appears to
me to be an ever increasing num
ber of instructors and their as
sistants.
During the past three years T
have had the privilege of attend
ing over one thousand lectures
at Stanford. The majority of these
have been both well organized
and well presented, and, conse
quently, have been profitable and
enjoyable.
On too many occasions, how
ever, I have been confronted
with inexcusable inconsiderations
by the lecturer. These have taken
a number of offensive forms:
speaking to a blackboard rather
than to the students; playing with
pocket change or car keys and
thus distracting the student's at
tention; presenting small and
often unreadable writing in con
junction with just plain sloppy
diagrams on a blackboard which
in the case of our various audi
toriums may be as far as one
hundred feet from some students;
speaking ton softly to be heard;
speaking indistinctly; wandering
aimlessly around a speaking plat
form; and.finally, presenting one
self and consequently, one's de
partment, with extremely poor
posture not at all indicative of
dignity.
I am convinced that there is
not a single member of this Uni
versity's teaching staff who is not
greatly interested in presenting
his material in the best manner
possible. Too often the presenta
tion is self-destructive and insult
ing to the members of the stu
dent body. With all due respect,
may I suggest that members of
the staff take time to consider
the etiquette of address.

Editor, The Daily:
In your issue of Jan. 11, 1961,
underneath your editorial "Be on

Guard," supposedly against prop
aganda and distortion of the
truth, you published an article,
j "Sweetheart of Mu Eta," which
| seems to be an attack on Senator
j Goldwater and Harvard, using
j the same methods you deplored
I in the above editorial.
Attached is a letter in copy that
was sent by Senator Goldwater
to the Yale Daily News editor, in
response to a query concerning
The Associated Press report
I which quoted Senator Goldwater
I praising fraternities, criticizing
| Harvard, and suggesting a casual
I relationship between that institu
tion's lack of fraternities and
"leftist tendencies" (quote of
CCD's editor).
To me such a query seems good
J journalism and The Daily could
j BEGIN to produce a decent paper
I by not. only "pract icing what it
; preaches" but also be following
the examples set by such papers
as the Oldest Campiis Daily. I be
lieve that in all fairness to your
selves and the public, you should
print Senator Goldwater's letter.
(I would also like to see this
letter printed.)
In closing I would like to com-
I ment upon your attack upon
j Harvard. It seems that Stanford
[attempts to emulate this august
! institution; is it because of failure
that The Stanford Daily is re
duced to maligning it?

Dear Ross:
The press has an unfortunate
I practice of misquoting conserva
j tives wherever possible, and the
i instance of my supposed remark
| concerning fraternities, commit
| nism. and Harvard not only was a
misquote but was entirely marie
j up in the mind of whatever re
; porter wrote it.
Unfortunately, there is no ef
fective way to retract what some
one else said, but I have been en
deavoring to correct the damage
i that was done by a personal letter
' to each who have written about

I it. During the course of my speech
| to the Interfraternity Conference,
I did not mention Harvard nor
! did I infer in anv way that where
.
: there are no fraternities commu
nism flourishes. In a press con
ference prior to Ihe meeting. T did
! get into a discussion about Key
nesianism and stated that I
thought it was unusual that Har
l vard would he the educational in-
Istitution fostering this, but at
!no time at that conference nor
j during Iho speech did I say any-
I thing such as has been credited to
: me.
In fact, T am getting a tran
script of the speech, and as soon
as I receive it, I will wee that you
get a copy of it, and you can do
; with it what you wish. I would
greatly appreciate your publish
ing any part of this letter that
you care to or of the speech when
, you receive it.
With best wishes,
