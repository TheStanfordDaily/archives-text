### 
ROME —(UPI)— The United

ing with 24 member nations al

treme starvation among 150,000
Baluba refugees in the Congo
over the next six months.
The FAO was advised just three

the capacity of the U.N. Congo
I operation 1o deal with il.

Dr. Norman C. Wright, Deputy
Director of FAO, said national
representatives at the meeting re
ported they still had no answer
from their governments on the
famine aid appeal.

He said he was disappointed at
the lack of response to the "very
great need and great urgency" of
famine relief hut added he was
"optimistic that offers will come
in now in a few days."
FAO officials said responsibil
ity for fie famine area will re
main with the existing U.N. Con

uary "then there won't be any
food available inside the Congo
and we will take over."
