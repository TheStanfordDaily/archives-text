Three African students arrived
recently in Munich after a period
of study in Moscow, and what
ihey reported indicates that the
Russians aren't doing very well in
displaying the glories of their
system. In fact, their reports
should convince Americans that
the Communists are far from
being an invincible enemy but
rather are susceptible to any
propoganda offensive that this
country may undertake in the
name of freedom.
What did these Africans say
that should give Americans such
hope? In an open letter sent to
Ihe heads of all African govern
ments and also to the U.N. Secre
tary-General, they protested
against "constant discrimination
and threats" and averred that stu
dents from Africa and the Near
East are beginning to realize that
they are being exploited in the
furtherance of Soviet power pol
itics.
The letter states: "We turned
our backs on Moscow full of dis
gust—and others will do the same
alter us —simply because of the
constant discrimination, threats
and restriction of our liberty."
At a secret meeting in Moscow,
the three students were empow
ered by their associates from nu
merous African countries to ren
der a protest against Soviet, treat
ment. The open letter resulted
from this meeting.
The protest, according to the
three, was prompted by a series
of clashes between African stu
dents and Soviet authorities.
Earlier ihis year, for example,
they were forbidden to demon
strate against French atomic tests
in the Sahara because Khrushchev
had just gone to Paris. Later their
student organization was forbid
den to meet. Numerous incidents
were also reported of Africans
being brutally beaten for not ad
hering to the strict Communist
line.
A few more pertinent excerpts
from the open letter follow: "The
Executive Committee of the Afri
can Student Organization in Mos
cow takes the liberty, on behalf of
all Africans, of directing atten
tion to the deceit, threats, pres
sure, brutality, and discrimination
with which the Soviet authorities
and government so frequently
treated African and other foreign

students in the USSR. Dangerous
new forms of colonialism . . . are
being fostered by the Communist
system. . .
"In connection with its aid-to-
Africa campaign the Soviet Union
lias taken many people into its
country illegally. Many of those
who want to cannot now return.
They are being exploited by the
Soviet propogandists against their
will. . . ." The letter was signed
by A. 11. Amur, a law student from
Uganda. The other two sponsors
of the letter were Theophilus
Okokwo, a medical student from
Nigeria, and Michel Ay ill, a med
ical student from Togo.
There are several reasons why
this news should be highly en
couraging to Americans. First, it
is evident that these Africans,
who represent the intellectual
elite of their countries, have a
strong sense of freedom and are
not about to trade one master for
another. Secondly, these students
have shown that they have the in
tellectual capacity to withstand
the barrage of half-truths and
lies that is being directed at them
and to recognize it as such. Third
: ly, this news points up once again
the major weakness in the Soviet
system which will lead to its
downfall that is, its opposition
to change through free thought.
Not only is this weakness leading
to internal stagnation and de
terioration, but it appears to be
alienating the very people upon
which the future of international
Communism depends.
