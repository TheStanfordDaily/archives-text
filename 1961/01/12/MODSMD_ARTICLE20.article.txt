During Iho lull between the end of the Los Angeles Invitational
Basketball Tournament and the opening of the Rig Five schedule
last week somebody asked UCLA Coach Johnny Wooden whom he
expected the most trouble from. Wooden's Bruins had wracked up
some large scores in the opening games of the season and, though
they eventually lost ihe tournament championship to lowa, they
were installed as Ihe favorites to win the AAWU title.
Wooden said that the Big Five was really a tough conference this

year and that he counted on
strong bids from Southern Cal,
Washington and California. "Stan
ford is the only team I count out
of the running," Wooden said.
A few days later Tom Harmon,
the ex-gridiron great from Michi
gan, who lias a much-listened-to
radio sports show, got to Rene
Herrarias, ( al's new basketball
coach, and asked him how lie
sized up tli<» conference.
Herrarias' remark went some
thing like: "Well, Tom, UCLA. SC
and Washington are all going to
be awfully tough to beat this
year. We're really looking for
some close games from them."
Then, almost as an afterthought,
Herrarias said, "And then, of
course, there's always Stanford.
You can't count them out."
Obviously Herrarias WAS
counting the Indians out and if he

hadn't he would have boon about the only one not to do so. No one
gives the Cards much of a chance 1 o win the AAWU basketball
tille. We should add that such assurances are not forthcoming from
this corner. At least not yet.
But after only the barest minimum of league play the pre season
forms show great possibility of collapsing altogether. UCLA was
lucky to escape witli a split in its two-game series with Washington
last weekend, as the Huskies, who were figured for a few upsets but
little more, won the first game relatively easily, 58-45, and put up a
gigantic struggle before dropping the second one, 62-58.
Shed a Tear for Cal
Then there is Ihe sad case of California. If any team was going
to beat UCLA it was Cal. Alter all. the Boars had waltzed to the
conference title last year and ended up second in the national rank
ings to Ohio State. True. Cal had lost the likes of All-American center
Darrall Imhoff, forward Tandy Gillis and others, but there was sup
posed to be enough returning strength to make a solid squad.
The Bears 10-st a couple of games in the pre-conference action,
but only to good teams and they chalked up some good wins; one
at the expense of Stanford in a consolation contest at the LA tourna
ment.
But since league play started the Berkeleyites have been unable
to beat their wives. Last weekend SC came up to Cal for the opening
Bis Five tussle for the two teams. The Tro.jans, hnl by hot-shooting
John Rudometkin, had been playing off-again on-again ball, but had
shown that at least they possessed the potential to affect the league
standings considerably.
But SC was up against a jinx. Cal had a string of 26 wins at home.
They just didn't lose when they were playing in the friendly atmos
phere of Harmon Gym in front of a bunch of horn-blowing maniacs
wearing straw hats and the rest of their rooting section.
Jinx-Breaking Is Easy
But the jinx was broken and for SC it was almost easy. Over
coming a few bad moments, the Trojans parlayed a 34-20 halftime
lead into a 57-50 victory. The next night, Saturday, it was a good
deal harder. In fact the Bears at times looked as if they weren't to
bo denied. But they wore and SC won 65-57. Exit one jinx.
Herrarias went away mumbling something to the effect that who
ever won the league title would probably have as many as four losses
anyway and the Bears started perparing for Stanford who would obvi
ously provide them with their first win.
Unkind as it may be to second-guess, Cal's loss to Stanford Tues
day leads to the elementary arithmetic conclusion that Cal has now
lost three games; all conference games, all home games. Maybe the
straw-hatters need a new drummer.
At any rate, barring a Pattersonian comeback or a radical change
in luck, the Bears, by Herrarias' own calculations, can bo counted
out of the conference race.
Stanford, in the meantime, engages in a couple of non-league
affairs Ibis weekend against the University of Oregon at Kugene.
Next week they'll star! playing for real again as Washington comes
to the Pavilion for a Friday-Saturday doubleheader.
And figuring the home-court as about a 15-point advantage, the
Huskies shouldn't . . . but we promised.
