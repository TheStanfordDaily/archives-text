### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford's 1961 rugby squad
opens its campaign with one of its
most experienced teams in years
this Saturday, taking on Ihe Pen
insula Ramblers on the Stanford
rugby field at 3.
Coach Pete Kmetovie's ruggers
are blessed with a strong, experi
enced scrum and should be al
least as strong, if not stronger,
than last year's aggregation
which amassed a record of six
wins, five losses and one lie.
RETURNING from last season
to make Iho Indians' front line
one of the strongest in the area
are Kyrk Reid, last year's leading
Card scorer and outstanding
hook e r, Don Peter and John
Thomas in the front rank and
Gary Pike, Phil Toorvald and
John Brandin in the second rank.
After a two-year absence, Troy
Barbee is returning to the Farm
and is expected to bolster the
Tribe line.
Tom McDo n a 1 d, one of last
year's stickouts, is slated to look
after the lock position, and new
comer Bobby Price and Tom Mc-
Manus, returning from the serv
ice, are battling for the scrum
half spot.
IN THIO backfield, Roy McMil
len at the center three-quarters
position, Dale Ostrander at one
wing, and Rod Sears are the out
standing returnees.
Stan Lindskog, up from the
JV's, should nail down the first
5/8 spot, and Hal Steuber, an
other newcomer, looks good in
the second 5/8.
Larry Royce and Chuck Cobb
are tangling for the other wing
assignment, while Jack McCul
louch and Tim Hansel look to
have the breakaway spots in tow.
JOHN C LARK, Steve Pursell
and Rich Hearney are other backs
who are likely to see plenty of
action as ihe season progresses.
Dick Zinn, Randy Vaughn and
Dick Hall are also new to rugby

this year, but arc slated to bo
busy if they come along as ex
pected.
The outlook for Stanford rug
by is good. Although the back
l'icld is not quite so strong as that
of last season, it is more than
adequate, and if Price and Mc-
Manus can come through in the
lock spot, the Cards could im
prove on last season's mark.
TIIK TOUGHKST opponents on
the Stanford schedule should be
the always powerful California
Bears, last year's area champs,
and the San Francisco Olympic
Clu b.
The Olympic Club had a turn
out of over 100 when it recently
began practice and should field
one of its strongest clubs in re
cent years.
Other teams on the Stanford
schedule include Ihe Peninsula
Ramblers, who are not too
strong; the Cal Alumni, who
should be one of the tougher
teams the Tribe will take on; St.
Mary's, who should be very im
proved over last year's weak
squad; and Ihe San Jose Rugby
Club, a new club this year that
should not be too powerful.
