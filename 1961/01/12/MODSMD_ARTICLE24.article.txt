# Skip Face Signs With Cowboys
## 
### 
The Dallas Cowboys of the Na
tional League yesterday an
nounced the signing of Stanford's i
William (Skip) Face.
FACE played fullback for the!
Indians, but was used as a de
fensive halfback in the East-West ;
Shrine game and may figure in j
the Cowboys' plans in this capac- 1
ity.
Face, a 6-1, 186-pounder, did the
punting and also played offensive i
halfback for the North in the an
nual Senior Bowl at Mobile.
While in college Face's lack of
size and great speed didn't handi
cap him and his versatile skills
more than offset his lack of sheer
physical strength. He is also a
fine place-kicker.
It is rumored that Skip was
given a $1,000 bonus for signing
with the one-year-old Dallas team.
Last season the Cowboys had
a disappointing record and this
season it seemed that there would
be trouble in signing the top col
lege prospects because of the high
bidding from the also one-year-old
teams of the American Football
League.
The San Francisco 49'ers have
already signed co-captain tackle
Dean Hinshaw and the Chicago
Bears, desperately in need of a
top-flight quarterback have
signed Indian Dick Norman.
