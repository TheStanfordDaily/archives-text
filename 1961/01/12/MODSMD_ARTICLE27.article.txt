# Cage Five Vs. Ducks
## 
### 
Stanford's surprising pagers,
fresh from their sweet triumph
at Harmon Gym in Berkeley, con
tinue their journeys with a trip
to Eugene, Oregon, this weekend
where they take on a strong Uni
versity of Oi-egon team Friday
and Saturday nights.
LKI) BY (5-7 Glenn Moore at
the pivot position, the Ducks will
tie tough to handle. Last season
when just a sophomore, Moore
led his team to an excellent 20-8
record.
Denny Strickland, a two-year
letterman, is the real veteran of
the starters and after the fi-.l
senior was shifted from forward
to guard last season the team
scoring greatly improved.
CHARLIE Warren and Bill
Simmons are currently holding
down the forward positions and
although both are not big by lo
day's hoop standards (6-4) Ihcsc
boys know their basketball.
The only real problem for the
Ducks this season is their lack
of depth at guard. Most of the
void occurred as a result of the
graduation of last year's team
captain Charlie Rask.
