# Stanford Girl Finds Polish Spirit Free

"We almost forgot we were behind the Iron Curtain," said Louise
Lamphere, a Stanford junior, in describing a recent trip that she
and some friends took to Poland.
"I was amazed at the amount of intellectual freedom that the
Poles have." she said. "This, of course, is the result of the 1956

Revolution which they feel they
won. Everyone is able to talk
pre Ity mu c h abo u t what he
wants."
MISS LAMPHERE, after torn
j pleting tlie fall quarter at Stan
j ford-in-Germany, drove to War
| saw where she stayed in a stu
; dent dormitory. She will work in
j a refugee camp in West Berlin
this month before returning to
this country in February.
Seeing a Communist rally in
; East Berlin earlier in the year,
she wrote, "I had the feeling 1
j was in a place I didn't belong
in a sort of different world."
In Poland, unlike East Berlin,
she found no blatant propaganda
and no statues of Stalin. Ameri
can books were in the bookstores
and Arthur Miller plays were be
j ing produced.
"THE POLES actually look
down on the Russians as cultur
ally inferior," she said. "They
I don't like being tied to them po
litically and economically, yet
they also feel this is the best they
I can do under the circumstances
of economic status and geograph
ical position."
Although the Poles look down
on the Russians, they hate the
j Germans, Miss Lamphere discov
| ered.
"One reason they are probably
allied with Russia is for protec
tion against Germany," she said.
! "I heard one Pole speak of feel
; ing that, perhaps, if some eco
| nomic or social crisis would come,
' the Fascist elements would rise
again in West Germany."
MISS LAMPHERE felt that the
image of the American embassy
lis not always good among the
Poles. "They (the embassy off
icials) are often 'cool' toward the
general populace." She had the
: opportunity to talk to one of these
I officials, the minister of cultural
! affairs, while she was in Warsaw.
