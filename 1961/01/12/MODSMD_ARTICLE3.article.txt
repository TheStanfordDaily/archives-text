# Berger to Talk On U.S. Jews
## 
### 
The problem of whether Ameri
can Jews truly have hyphenated
citizenship, and belong both to
the United States and to Israel
will be the lopie of a speech this
afternoon at 4:15 in Cubberly by
Dr. Elmer Berger. Executive Vice
President of the American Coun
cil for Judaism.
The problem is that the Balfour
Declaration of 1917 promised the
Jews of the world that "the estab
lishment in Palestine of a na
tional home for th e Jew is h
people" would not "prejudice the
rights and political status of Jews
in any other country."
Nevertheless, only two weeks
ago in an address to the 25th
Zionist Congress, Premier David
Ben-Gurion declared that the Jew
ish religion was a product of the
land of Israel and was therefore
bound up in duties to the state."
He further contended that "Jews
who lived outside of Israel were
godless and violated the precepts
of Judaism every day they re
mained away from Ihe country."
Dr. Bcrger's address is being
sponsored by Pi Sigma Alpha, the
Political Science Honor Society.
