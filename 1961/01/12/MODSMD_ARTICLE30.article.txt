# Stanford Dog Lauded by Medical World
## 
### 
Sam, a 4-year-old pointer, was
picked from a group of 20 Stan
ford dogs to be Research Dog
Hero of 1960, the medical profes
sion learned last night.
The National Society for Medi
cal Research, an anti-anti-vivisec
tion group, gave him a silver eol
lnr for his participation in experi
ments at the Stanford Medical
School. Surgeons removed a valve
from one side of his heart and
replaced it with a valve from an
other part of his heart, a move
theorized to improve heart func
tion in cases of faulty mitral
valves.
Although the operation failed
to cure Sam's severe case of dan
druff, it has been otherwise suc
cessful in the seven months since
it was performed. 11 it proves
completely successful on Sam.
said Dr. Norman E. Shumway,
who performed the surgery, it
will be tried on human rheuma
tism sufferers.
Sam nixed the dog biscuits of
fered him at the ceremonial ban
quet in favor of the caviar hors
d'oeuvres served other members
of the San Francisco Medical So
ciety.
