# U.S. Gives 4 Warplanes To Laotian Government

### 
VIENTIANE, Laos (UPI) The delivery of the first four Ameri
can warplanes to the pro-Western Laotian government yesterday
strengthened its position in the fight against the pro-Communist
Pathet Lao rebels.
First of 12 propeller-driven T-6 fighter-trainer planes expected

to be provided Laos under U.S.
I military aid were put under strict
I security protection yesterday at
i Vietil iane Airport.
ALTHOUGH their top speed is
1 less than 200 miles an hour, the
{ planes are equipped to carry two
100-pound bombs and two 30-cali
ber machine guns. They are a
radical improvement on the trans
port and Ligot liaison planes
which have made up Gen. Phoumi
Nosavan's air force thus far.
Observers said the new planes
which will be manned by French
trained Laotian pilots, could
strengthen the government's posi
tion against the rebels for a pos
sible negotiated settlement of the
fighting.
IT WAS thought the T-6 planes
might be able to harrass Soviet
air supply operations at the Plain
of Jars Airfield, where as many as
10 Russian transports are deliver
ing war supplies daily to the
rebels.
The Soviet Ilyushin transports
are believed to be armed. One
fired on an American plane over
Laos recently.
(There was no explanation of
what the "appropriate action"
would be but Communist broad
casts said Ihe United States had
sent into Laos "many more
fighter planes" and pilots "in the
guise of Thai volunteers.")
Meanwhile, tiny Laos told the
mighty Soviet Union to halt its
airlift to the Communists or it
would "take appropriate action."
