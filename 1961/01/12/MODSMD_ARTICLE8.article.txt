# Impassioned Panel Argues Over HCUA
## Excited Overflow Crowd Views Film of SF Riots 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
The House Committee on Un-American Activities was alternately
blasted and praised by an impassioned four-man panel before an
equally excited overflow throng in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Students jammed into every dusty corner of the auditorium and
standing in the lobby and corridors outside, first viewed the contro-

versial HCUA film "Operation
Abolition" and then listened for
an hour and 20 minutes as the
panel members took turns attack
ing or defending the committee.

Greenberg took the HCUA to task
on three main points:
• It is unconstitutional.
• It destroys civil liberties.
• Its existence and methods arc
of "immense help" to communism
KAIIL Prussion, a former Coin
munist and later an FBI counter
spy, and YVilhelm Schmitt, an en

KZSU, HBO kc, will present a
tape of the debate tonight at
K p.m.

gineer working on Lockheed
Corp's Polaris project, defended
the committee, ably moderated by
Professor William McCord, on
these main points:
• It is necessary for the HCUA
to exist so it can root out and
public-ally expose Communist
techniques and Communists.
• The HCUA serves a legiti
mate purpose by proposing to the
House legislation to fight com
munism. and in helping that leg
islation's passage.
• The menace of communism
to the United States is "extremely
critical" and only through "grass
roots" organizations and groups
such as the HCUA can Americans
successfully combat the Red dan
ger.
FOLLOWING the film's show
ing. Greenberg opened discussion
by citing nine "documented inac
curacies and distortions" appear
ing in the film or its sound track.
He called the movie a "typical
display of disregard for honesty
and ethics on the part of the
HCUA" and said this "provides
one more reason why this body
should be abolished!"
Prussion then replied that he
and Schmitt weren't debating the
HCUA's film or methods but in
stead were "urging that the in
vestigative powers of (the com
mittee) be strengthened," because
it is one effective way of fighting
communism.
Hli DECLARED that his more
than 10 years as a Communist
convinced him that (1> it is "to
tally wrong" to discuss commu
nism as an ideology, philosophy
or political party that the Red
j movement in the U.S. is "a con
spiracy to overthrow the govern
ment by violence" and nothing
lelse: <2» the Communists have
; total contempt for the laws of the
nation but will use them to the
i utmost to overthrow the govern
ment; and (3) U.S. Communists
i will work on either one or both
i sides of an issue if they are di
| reded to do so by their Kremlin
j bosses.
HE SAII) that U.S. Communists
i are workers for "Red Fascism"
j exclusively, and the real menace
■ j to the nation is the "Communist
; conspirators and their apolo
, gists."
Searle, who participated in the
demonstrations last May at San
' Francisco's City Hall when "Op
eration Abolition" was made, hit
jat the HCUA for employing the
; "multiple untruth" technique in
! the film.
During the question period
; later, in referring to what he
: called the smearing of the lives of
those summoned before the
i HUCA, Searle also asked whether
ja democratic government has the
i right to prosecute those who may
hold dissenting or even anti-demo
cratic views, if those persons have
j not broken any laws.
SCHMITT at one point told his
audience which hissed, clapped,
booed and otherwise burst forth
regularly during the movie and
discussion in referring to some
statements just made by Searle,
that it had "just seen a remark
able demonstration of Communist
technique."

The auditorium began filling
with students about 6:15 and by
6:50 was jammed to capacity,
with the audience lapping into
and almost filling the Cubberley

DURING the film and discus

The House Committee on Un-American Activities was alternately
blasted and praised by an impassioned four-man panel before an
equally excited overflow throng in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Students jammed into every dusty corner of the auditorium and

on three main points:
• It is unconstitutional.
• It destroys civil liberties.
• Its existence and methods arc
of "immense help" to communism

gineer working on Lockheed

the committee, ably moderated by
Professor William McCord, on
these main points:
• It is necessary for the HCUA
to exist so it can root out and
public-ally expose Communist
techniques and Communists.
• The HCUA serves a legiti
mate purpose by proposing to the
House legislation to fight com
munism. and in helping that leg
islation's passage.
• The menace of communism
to the United States is "extremely
critical" and only through "grass
roots" organizations and groups
such as the HCUA can Americans
successfully combat the Red dan
ger.
FOLLOWING the film's show
ing. Greenberg opened discussion
by citing nine "documented inac
curacies and distortions" appear
ing in the film or its sound track.
He called the movie a "typical
display of disregard for honesty
and ethics on the part of the
HCUA" and said this "provides
one more reason why this body
should be abolished!"
Prussion then replied that he
and Schmitt weren't debating the
HCUA's film or methods but in
stead were "urging that the in
vestigative powers of (the com
mittee) be strengthened," because
it is one effective way of fighting
communism.

than 10 years as a Communist
convinced him that (1> it is "to

nism as an ideology, philosophy
or political party that the Red

j bosses.
HE SAII) that U.S. Communists
i are workers for "Red Fascism"

Searle, who participated in the
demonstrations last May at San

eration Abolition" was made, hit
jat the HCUA for employing the
; "multiple untruth" technique in
! the film.
During the question period
; later, in referring to what he

those summoned before the

ja democratic government has the
i right to prosecute those who may
hold dissenting or even anti-demo
cratic views, if those persons have
j not broken any laws.

The auditorium began filling
with students about 6:15 and by
6:50 was jammed to capacity,
with the audience lapping into
and almost filling the Cubberley
lobby and milling in the corridors.
DURING the film and discus
sion, some stood on chairs at the
doors and peered in over the
heads of those standing in back
and extending about a fifth of
the way down the two main aisles.
The film was shown a second
time at 10 p.m. and the audi
torium was quickly packed to the
limit, with many again unable to
get in.
The House Committee on Un-American Activities was alternately
blasted and praised by an impassioned four-man panel before an
equally excited overflow throng in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Students jammed into every dusty corner of the auditorium and
standing in the lobby and corridors outside, first viewed the contro-

versial HCUA film "Operation

an hour and 20 minutes as the
panel members took turns attack

on three main points:
• It is unconstitutional.
• It destroys civil liberties.

gineer working on Lockheed

the committee, ably moderated by
Professor William McCord, on
these main points:
• It is necessary for the HCUA
to exist so it can root out and
public-ally expose Communist
techniques and Communists.
• The HCUA serves a legiti
mate purpose by proposing to the
House legislation to fight com
munism. and in helping that leg
islation's passage.
• The menace of communism
to the United States is "extremely
critical" and only through "grass

such as the HCUA can Americans
successfully combat the Red dan
ger.
FOLLOWING the film's show
ing. Greenberg opened discussion
by citing nine "documented inac
curacies and distortions" appear
ing in the film or its sound track.
He called the movie a "typical
display of disregard for honesty
and ethics on the part of the
HCUA" and said this "provides
one more reason why this body
should be abolished!"
Prussion then replied that he
and Schmitt weren't debating the
HCUA's film or methods but in

vestigative powers of (the com

it is one effective way of fighting
