HAVANA (I'Pli Cuba's inva
sion jitters slackened perceptibly
yesterday, and Premier Fidel Cas

ists."
There was considerably less
military activity in Havana itself
and indications were that civilian
| militiamen and women were being
released from military duties.
THE GOVERNMENT radio net
work continued to operate on an
I "emergency" basis. It issued pe
riodic warnings of the alleged in

before Jan. 18. But the broadcasts
no longer carried the tone of ur
, geney that marked the general
mobilization 11 days ago.
The government newspaper
Revolucion printed a report that
the premier was with the front
line defenders "somewhere in
, Cuba." Photographs showed Cas
! tro manning a coastal artillery
| gun, directing fire on targets
claimed to be nine miles out at
I sea.
SEVERAL PLATOONS of mili
tiamen guarding the hastily-dug
gun emplacements along Hava
-1 na's malecon were replaced by

ment was heeding the advice of
1 Ernesto (Che) Guevara, president
of the National Bank, to free mili
liamen and women to return to

threat to production. Guevara,
who recently returned from Mos
cow and Peiping, had coupled his
suggestion wit ha warning against
