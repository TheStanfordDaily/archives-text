# Legislature Cheers, Then Acts
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
To the echo of a hearty S-T-A-N
-| F-O-R-D yell, Legislatui-e last
| night:
• Approved Ralph Bunche as
top speaker at the annual lIR
j Foreign Policy Institute set for
I late this year.
• Agreed to underwrite a Stu-
I dent-Faculty Commission booklet
I of biographies of outstanding fac
ulty and administration members.
• Took under consideration a
| proposal to add the ASSU vice
j president to the committee which
j chooses assistant cheer leaders.
This move came after head yell
leader Tim Laddish, after confes
sing the ASSU constitution wasn't
followed (as it hasn't been in
recent years) in the choosing of
his four assistants, then intro
duced those assistants.
TO PROVE their capability,
Laddish and his jolly band then
led LASSU in a rousing Stanford
yell — proving that, the cheer
leaders are quite capable and
LASSU members would them
selves make good cheer leaders.
Afler the noise died down, the
By-Laws and Rules Committee
was given for study the proposal
that the vice president be added
1 to the selection committee, and
that LASSU have the power to
approve or disapprove assistant
cheer leaders — power which it
doesn't now possess.
The 76-page booklet Stu-Fae
Com will come out early in spring
quarter will sell for 50 cents, will
1 be brightly written, and will be
an attempt to "further interests
and relations between students
and faculty."
COVER of the booklet probably
will be done by Dick Bibler, au
i thor of "Little Man on Campus"
cartoons. Stu-Fac hopes that the
booklet will be adopted by the
University administration and
kept up to date by it.
In other action, the group
okayed the Stanford Student Art
Association's taking up tempo
rarily the campus publicity oper
ations of the defunct Public Re
lations Committee.
