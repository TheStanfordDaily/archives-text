# PROFESSORS ASK
## Can the Natives Read English? 
### 
Special to The Daily
English? Our native tongue?
Educators long ago gave up ex
pecting college students to be
able to spell their native language
or in many cases to he able to
write il legibly. But is it too much
to ask thai they be able to read
it and to be able to understand
what they read?
Evidently il is . . . for six uni
versity professors who took part
in an annual meeting Ihe Associ
ation of American Colleges held
in Denver recently told the col
lege administrators present that
the majority of students entering
college today have read almost
no literature and have rarely been

introduced in more than a super
ficial way to any of the classics.
As a result, one Harvard pro
fessor of English told the group,
these students "cannot read Eng
lish with perceptive and discrimi
nating taste."
Other scholars also bemoaned
the background of the students
with which Freshmen English de
partments everywhere are forced
to contend. And another speaker.
Dr. Brand Blanshard, professor of
philosophy at Yale, told the
group:
"Against the partisan slogans,
the pollyana faiths, the self
righteous nationalism <>112 our time,
the nightmare art and beatnik
poetry, the erotic stage, the vio

lent television, the perpetual ado
leseenee of the screen, there i. w
perhaps no full protection.
"But the best I know is that
habit of detached and critical re
flection which belongs to the phil
osophical spirit. To expose out
students to the contagion of that
spirit so effectively that they
catch it. whether from the pages
of Plato or Mill or from our own
halting example, is to bestow on
them a gift beyond price."
This was the 17th annual meet
ing of the association, which at
tempts to keep college admin
istrators informed on the latest
developments and trends in the
various academic disciplines.
