# Key Segregation Law Nullified; Investigation of Rioting Ordered
## Faculty Petitions for Return Of Two Suspended Negroes 
### 
ATHENS, Ga., (UPIi A federal judge who ordered integration
of the University of Georgia voided a key segregation law yesterday
and the Justice Department ordered a preliminary investigation into
mob actions that caused the suspension of the two Negro students.
Judge Bootle voided a state law yesterday which provided for

cutting of funds to any Georgia
school that was integrated. Ho
called the law "patently unconsti
tutional."
HE ALSO adjourned until 2
p.m. today a second hearing he
was holding on a request that he
force the University of Georgia
to lift it's suspension of the two
Negro students. The action was
brought by attorneys for the two
Negroes.
Attorney General William P.
Rogers announced in Washington
that the purpose of the Justice
Department probe was to deter
mine whether any federal law had
been violated in the rioting
Wednesday night and the subse
quent removal of two Negro stu
dents from the school.
He said the action was taken
under a provision of the new 1960
Civil Rights Act which makes it
a federal offense to impede or
obstruct the carrying out of fed
eral court orders.
SOME 300 members of the Uni
versity faculty petitioned last
night for the return to classes of
the two suspended students.
Several students meanwhile
charged the rioting was caused by
outside agitators and the Ku Klux
Klan.
"Most of the students are
ashamed of what went on last
night," Terry Hazelwood. editor
of the student paper "Red and
Black" said.
Eight students and nine adults
were arrested during the rioting.
Eight of the adults were identi
fied today as members of the Ku
Klux Klan.
JUDGE BOOTLE issued a tem
porary order this week barring
the state from cutting off funds
to the university. His action today
made the ruling permanent.
Although state officials ob
jected to a federal judge striking
down a local law, they appeared
relieved to be rid of the lawâ€”
which they feel might prove more
a hinderance than a help in their
continuing fight against segre
gation.
Frank Twitty, House Floor
Leader in the Legislature, said
Judge Bootle's order "obviates
the necessity of doing anything.
It further means that the univer
sity will continue to operate, how
ever, distasteful that might be to
all of us who are segregationists,"
he said.
THE GEORGIA General As
sembly moved late today to take
a direct hand in the integration
crisis.
House speaker George Smith
said a special House subcommit
tee will begin hearings in Athens
tomorrow to probe "conflicting
rumors and reports" of the uni
versity situation.
