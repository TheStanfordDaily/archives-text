# How Much Longer?

### 
At Wednesday's HCUA debate, Karl Prussion attempted to
gloss over the faet that "Operation Abolition" contained many
distortions and inaccuracies. He stated he was not present to
discuss the film, hut the "communist conspiracy"' which threat
ens our welfare.
Both he and Wilhelm Sclimitt admitted there were distortions
in the film. Both also claimed that the demonstrations of last
May were communist-inspired and commnnist-led. However, if
there is a preponderance of evidence which indicated that the
demonstrations were communist-inspired and communist-led, then
why was it necessary to distort what happened at the hearings?
Why not let the facts speak for themselves? Why rearrange
the "facts" 1 into a distorted picture? Such distortion of truth is a
favorite weapon of the HCUA and is highly unethical. Sclunitt
talked a great deal about the immorality of communism. Surely
he must realize that the committee uses the same methods of de
ceit and lies as do the communists.
Lack of honesty and ethics is only one of many reasons why
the ll(.I A should he abolished. Another is that its mandate is so
vague and sweeping as to be unconstitutional. In \\ at kins vs. the
U.S., the Supreme Court expressed great doubt as to the legality
of the committee's mandate, while it dismissed the contempt of
Congress charge because \\ atkins had been denied due process
in the course of his appearance before the committee.
The committee does not concentrate on producing legislation,
but on exposure. The legitimate function of a Congressional Com
mittee is the gathering of information for the purpose of making
laws.
The HCUA has compiled a long list of organizations and pub
lications which it calls subversive, and has branded individuals
as Communists and "fellow-travelling subversives, lis subpoenas
have often, as in the case of the 110 California teachers, been
served at the place of work of the subpenee. Ihe results of this
for the individuals involved include: loss of job. loss of social
standing, ostracism and public humiliation. That these are pun
ishments of individuals who are accused of no crime under any
law is clear.
The committee is supposedly a legislative organization, and
yet, the committee has produced little legislation. I lie American
Civil Liberties 1 nion has surveyed the committee's claim to legis
lative prowess and finds that it can be given partial credit (or but
two hills in its 21-year history. Both of these are now being tested
in the courts by the ACLIJ on the grounds that they are uneon
stitut ional.
The committee also wastes money. One-third of a million dol
lars a year is too much to pay for HCUA's services: little legisla
tion, and inquisitorial proceedings. The Knight newspapers re
cently published details of the HCUA's expenses: lavish hotel
rooms, chaufTeur-driven limousines, night club tabs for entertain
ing "friends of the committee," unreturned library books (includ
ing children's stories), and expensive lunch and dinner parties.
All of these were paid for from lax funds.
One of our most serious complaints against the committee is
that it usurps judicial functions. Trials and punishment are the
business of the Courts, not the Congress. A man must be held to
answer for what he does, not what he believes. The Judiciary,
when charges are levelled at an individual, scrupulously protects
the rights of the accused. A witness before the HCUA may have
counsel, but his counsel may not speak for him; the witness is
not entitled to know the nature of the information the commit
tee has concerning him, nor where they got the information.
Neither is he permitted to confront his accusers and cross-examine
them.
Lastly, and this is undoubtedly the most important point of
all, the committee discourages freedom of inquiry. By persecut
ing the holders of unpopular opinions, individuals are dissuaded
from participating in the search for a political philosophy.
The right to expression of diverse and unpopular views has
ever been the right on which this democracy rests. Democracy
can be preserved only if freedom of inquiry is preserved. A small
band of roving inquisitors has no RIGHT to determine what you
or I are to think, read, or say.
No one questions that communism is a threat to our way of
life, that we must be on guard. On the other hand, we must not
let fear of an external enemy allow us to accept an undemocratic,
unconstitutional congressional committee to exist. The I-BI can
handle the problem of internal communism. The Judiciary (.0111-
inittee, endowed with the powers to try and to judge, should be
utilized instead of the HCUA.
To repeat, there is no justification for the HCUA's existence.
Its only function is to expose. It has accomplished little except
to villify, intimidate and to ruin. It has harassed Americans who
work for racial equality and justice. Il has increased bitterness
between racial and religious groups of our citizens, which in turn
has imperiled our good relations with the people of Asia, Africa
and Latin America.
How much longer must we be burdened with this committee?
