; Editor, the Daily:
Wilhelm Schmitt pointed out at
;the HCUA discussion that when
James Hoffa and the payola peo
ple were being investigated, there
were no cries for "civil liberties"
j or of "improper judiciary func
| tion." But whenever the HCUA
I meets, these cries are always
sounded and echoed.
It is also interesting that pub
lic attention was focused on
Jimmy Hoffa and the payola peo
ple and not on the committee in
; vestigating them. However, pub
lic attention has always focused
j on the HCUA and not on the Com
munists it has investigated.
Could it not be that while the
likes of Hoffa did not wage a
campaign to turn public opinion
against the commit tees, the Com
munists did and successfully so
that the public's attention was
distracted from the Communists
and their masterful infiltration?
The "judgment" of the subpoe
j naed people is not made by the
HCUA but by the public. That
I Hoffa is still in power is a reflec
tion of the Union's judgment of
him. That Dick Clark is still
popular is ihe judgment of the
teenagers. That certain subpoe
naed people lose their jobs is a
'reflection of you, the public's
judgment. HCUA has no judi
ciary function.
If the HCUA is improperly con
stituted and its methods uncon
stitutional, then the entire pro
gram of congresional investiga
tions should be reviewed.
It is unfortunate that Ihe film
distorted the "facts" concerning
the riots and that the speakers
against communism were so in
articulate, unsophisticated and
unresponsive to audience psy
chology. But their message is
clear; communism is breeding in
America. You are being warned.
Will you listen . . . please?

Editor, tlie Daily:
The tone of Wednesday's debate
over the HCUA was set, unfor
tunately, at a very low level. The
anti-committee side was forced 10
concentrate on discrepancies in
the sequence of the film, which
should have been obvious once the
facts were brought to light, be
cause the defenders of the com
mittee could not deny them.
The defenders avoided the de
bate by digressing info emotional
harangues on the evils of Com
munism. Both sides were unable
to discuss one of the major is
sues underlying the whole con
troversy! Whether or not support
ing beliefs also supported by the
Communist Party makes one a
Communist.
This piece of faulty logic was
employed several times by Wil
helm Schmitt, a defender of the
Committee, once to accuse Prof.
John Searle of using "Communist
technique," and several times dur
ing the debate and in the informal
discussions that followed, to infer
that Searle might easily be a
dupe of the party.
The questions that follow
are: should we continue to nur
ture. under the pretense of pre
serving democracy, an organiza
tion which, by its very nature, de
prives citizens of their rights
under democracy? Mtist we, just
to avoid appearing to play right
into Communist hands, continue

! to -sol: the stage for more "Com-
I munist-inspired" fiascoes? Does
| any "information" to be gained
j by these committee hearings out
i weigh the propagandic hay reaped
by the Communists at them?
By the same token, should we
suspend our efforts toward inte
gration in the South because the
Communists also suport integra
i tion?
It is difficult to believe that we
j are willing to label any dissenting
! opinions arrived at logically and
I sensibly such as those held by
I Prof. S e a r 1 e as Communist.
1 Should we not instead praise
j them for their idealism for their
strong stand on principle —
' AMERICAN principle?
The excitement aroused by
| Wednesday's debate was not to-
I ward Communism. It was strong
I INTELLECTUAL excitement, to
ward questioning, toward finding
the facts, and reaching a tenable
stand on the value of the HCUA.
A good deal of the excitement was
sparked by the honest enthusiasm
of Prof. Searle, and of his and
Mr. Green berg's presentation of
j a concise, documented proof of
j the inaccuracies of Ihe film. The
very academic integrity of the de
bate was continually defiled by
the emotional digressions of Mr.
Schmitt and Mr. Prussion.
Communism is a dirty word;
both sides agreed to that. But are
j we to stand back and allow mani-
I festations of our academic intel
lectual freedom be slandered by
such a name?

Editor, the Daily:
During the HCUA debate, I
asked Dr. Searle a question, the
nature of which was generally
misunderstood. Mea culpa! The
question was conceived only a few
moments before its audible artic
i ulation.
i Dr. Searle held that Congres
sional internal security investiga
tion committees accomplish noth
ing which cannot be achieved by
other agencies of the Federal Gov
ernment.
The question: In 1946 Secretary
Byrnes ordered 3,(|)0 State De
partment employes screened for
security reasons. In 1950, Sena
tor McCarthy demanded that the
State Department justify that
continued employment of those
whom the Secretary had found to
be unfit for Government service.
The Tydings committee was in
formed: "Of these 341 disappro
vals 58, as stated above, after re
ceiving FULL clearance, are still
employed by the Department."
McCarthy questioned the relia
bility of these "clearances" and
for two years State Department
executives in TIIEIR OFFICIAL
CAPACITY went around the
country calling him a "dema
gogue." (Examples: General Con
rad Snow, chairman of the State
Department's Loyalty Security
Board; Carlisle Humelsine, As
sistant Secretary of State Ad
! minist ration, t
In 19.~2. Mr. Humelsine admitted
to Ihe McCarran Committee that
since 1:150, 12 of the 58 have not
'survived loyalty investigations.
Only 16 of ihe original Byrnes
i list/ ofc course, "after receiving
I full clearance arc still employed
I by th«» Department." McCarthy
spoke well.
Dr. Searle, can't Congressional

Investigation Committees,
through their consideration of
controversial cases (Lattimore,
Jessup, Vincent, Remington, etc.)
and their harassment of loyalty
programs check bureaucratic
! hanky-panky?
Peter F. Eriekson
Editor, The Daily:
It seems that an overemphasis
lon grades dealt with in a past
' editorial will continue here at
I Stanford as long as a perverted
j arrangement exists. So long as
I tests and papers are returned
j without any comment or criti
cism, or even a mark other than
a grade, students will naturally
regard these exercises in the con
text of grades alone, instead of an
educational experience.
Essays in particular are valu
able only to the extent Ihat a stu
dent learns by his mistakes and
his successes. And certainly, a
paper returned with only a grade
does not meet this criterium.
"Readers" who do not comment
in order for ultimate improve
ment of the writers simply do
not live up to their part, of the
educational bargain, and are in
i truth, they are no belter than a
j machine like a scale which re
! cords figures.
Such a machine, indeed, cer
tainly floes enforce Ihe natural
tendency to think in terms of
grades. But ironically, since the
machine does not give any hint
of the criteria for improvement, it
is impossible for Ihe student to
better the figures which are
| turned out.
