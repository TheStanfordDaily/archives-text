# Ike's Optimistic Report Draws Praise, Scorn
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) â€” Presi
dent Eisenhower's optimistic
State of the Nation reports on the
economy, foreign relations and
I defense drew scornful rejoinders
| yesterday from Democratic mem
, bers of Congress.
But Republicans generally saw
ihc message as statesmanlike and
1 factual. House GOP Leader
Charles A. Halleck of Indiana
I called it "concise, constructive and
most encouraging."
i "None are so blind as those who
! will not sec," commented Rep.
Daniel J. Flood, D-Pa., who said
'recent evidence is that the na
tional position at home and
abroad is "far worse" than even
Ihe gloomiest prophets had fore
! cast.
Chairman J. William Fulbright,
D-Ark., of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee, said "the in
coming administration is con
fronted by as difficult a set of
| circumstances as any administra
tion sincc the war between the
states."
Sen. George D. Aiken, R-Vt.,
! said the President "properly
| points out that the problems that
have been with us the past eight
years are going to remain with
us and are of a continuing na
! ture."
Sen. Bourke B. Hickenlooper,
R-lowa, termed Iho speech "an
excellent review" and Sen. Ilomer
E. Capehart, R-Ind., praised it as
I a "good, honest, frank state-
I ment."
The private remarks of many
Democrats were even more crit
ical than those they had for the
!record.
"The poor old guy is leaving
office in a few days," said one
House member with liberal lean
ings. "So I don't want to be too
hard on him."
Another privately pictured the
President's appraisals as "more

lof the same baloney he's been
I feeding us for years."
Halleck, however, said the mes
sage "shows that we can carry
| forward the tremendous accom
plishments he has made if we
simply use good sense and bal
ance in what we do during Ihc
years ahead," Halleck said.
Chairman Overton Brooks, D-
La., of the House Space Commit
tee took sharp issue with the
President's contention that U.S.
Space developments make this
j country "pre-eminent" in the field.
Brooks noted that this country
has not yel caught up with Rus
sia in the development of big
space rockets and that "until we
| catch up in this field we will lag
behind the Soviet Union."
Brooks said the Eisenhower
Administration has failed to push
ispace work with sufficient ur
| gency.
On the Republican side of the
Space Committee, Rep. James G.
Fulton, Pa., endorsed the Presi
dent's message and said he has
I no doubt America now has a com
manding lead over Russia both in
military and civilian space devel
j opment.
The President's report on his
j world travels, and his contention
that success of his and other top
level visits abroad prompted Rus
sia to wreck the Summit confer
ence, drew some raised eyebrows.
"It is so far fetched that I'm
wordless," said Rep. Chet Holi
field, D-Calif., chairman of the
Joint Committee on Atomic En
ergy. "The tone of the message
is in my opinion an extravagant
misstatement of the actual condi
tion of our international relations.
They have deteriorated through
out the world. I have just re
turned from a tour of NATO
countries and was shocked by the
spread of neutralism and antag
onism towards military coopera
tion with the U.S. in some of
these countries."
