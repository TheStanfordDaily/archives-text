# FIVE STARTERS RETURNING
## Stanford Boxers Open Against Treasure Island This Afternoon Daily Sports 
### PETE CRAWFORD 
Stanford's boxing team will
start its season this afternoon
with a workout with Treasure
Island Naval Base in the boxing
room at 4:30.
Saturday night John Minaletti,
at 139, Chuck Keller, at 147, and
Ed Cummings, at heavyweight,
will participate in a novice meet
at Santa Clara.
STANFORD is a member of
the California Collegiate Boxing
Conference which is the only re
maining U.S. collegiate boxing

conference. Last year Stanford
lost only to Chico State on some
hotely disputed decisions and beat
Cal twice in going the rest of the
season undefeated.
Coach Ray Lunny, Stanford's
coach of the year last year, has
five starters returning, four of
whom were the winners in their
respective divisions at the CCBC
finals. There are also some excel
lent newcomers to fill in some
weight divisions and add depth
1o others.
L O () K I N G at the team by
weight divisions, Stanford is well
set at 125 with Steve Morris, who
was the CCBS champion at this
weight last year. The 132 group
is one of the weak spots on the
team and so far nobody has been
named to this position.
At 139 Jeff Tompkins will start
and John Minaletti will provide
strong depth. Tompkins was the
CCBC champion at 132 last year
and has moved up one weight
division. At 147 Keller will be one
of the newcomers on the team,
but his performance in the intra
murals showed him to be a very
fast and aggressive fighter.
At lf)6 Stanford is very strong
with Bruce Bellows returning.
Bellows was a semi-finalist in the
NCAA and his bouts with Ricci
at Cal should be as exciting as
last year's. At 178 Stanford has

another CCBC champion in Tal-1
ton Ray, who came along fast
last season and is in top shape j
again.
IN THE heavyweight division i
Stanford is fortunate to have Ed
Rothman hack. Rothman was the
CCBC champion at heavyweight
last year and in addition was a
finalist in the NCAA tournament.
Although he is a little light for
his division, his aggressiveness
and heavy pitching made him one
of the most popular fighters on
the team.
Rothman was ill this fall and

unable to work out, but he is now
training hard and will be ready
to go. Ed Cummings adds excel
lent depth to this division and
promises to become an outstand
ing boxer.
The team would seem to have
a very good chance of winning
the conference this year and even
of going undefeated. The squad
abounds in experience and has
strength in both the lower and
upper weight divisions.
Their toughest opponents this
year should be California, Cal
Poly and Chico State.

Stanford's boxing team will
start its season this afternoon
with a workout with Treasure
Island Naval Base in the boxing
room at 4:30.
Saturday night John Minaletti,
at 139, Chuck Keller, at 147, and
Ed Cummings, at heavyweight,
will participate in a novice meet
at Santa Clara.
STANFORD is a member of
the California Collegiate Boxing
Conference which is the only re
maining U.S. collegiate boxing

conference. Last year Stanford
lost only to Chico State on some
hotely disputed decisions and beat
Cal twice in going the rest of the
season undefeated.
Coach Ray Lunny, Stanford's
coach of the year last year, has
five starters returning, four of
whom were the winners in their
respective divisions at the CCBC
finals. There are also some excel
lent newcomers to fill in some
weight divisions and add depth
1o others.
L O () K I N G at the team by
weight divisions, Stanford is well
set at 125 with Steve Morris, who
was the CCBS champion at this
weight last year. The 132 group
is one of the weak spots on the
team and so far nobody has been
named to this position.
At 139 Jeff Tompkins will start
and John Minaletti will provide
strong depth. Tompkins was the
CCBC champion at 132 last year
and has moved up one weight
division. At 147 Keller will be one
of the newcomers on the team,
but his performance in the intra
murals showed him to be a very
fast and aggressive fighter.
At lf)6 Stanford is very strong
with Bruce Bellows returning.
Bellows was a semi-finalist in the
NCAA and his bouts with Ricci
at Cal should be as exciting as
last year's. At 178 Stanford has

another CCBC champion in Tal-1
ton Ray, who came along fast
last season and is in top shape j
again.
IN THE heavyweight division i
Stanford is fortunate to have Ed
Rothman hack. Rothman was the
CCBC champion at heavyweight
last year and in addition was a
finalist in the NCAA tournament.
Although he is a little light for
his division, his aggressiveness
and heavy pitching made him one
of the most popular fighters on
the team.
Rothman was ill this fall and

unable to work out, but he is now
training hard and will be ready
to go. Ed Cummings adds excel
lent depth to this division and
promises to become an outstand
ing boxer.
The team would seem to have
a very good chance of winning
the conference this year and even
of going undefeated. The squad
abounds in experience and has
strength in both the lower and
upper weight divisions.
Their toughest opponents this
year should be California, Cal
Poly and Chico State.
