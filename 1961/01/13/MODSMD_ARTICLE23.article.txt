# Indians Tangle With Ducks Tonight, Hoopsters Look for Third Straight
## 
### 
Fresh off an upset win over
Cal, the Stanford basketball team
travels northward to test their
fortunes against the alternately
hot and cold Ducks of Oregon to
night.
Tomorrow Ihe two teams meet
in Ihe second of the week end se
ries at Eugene's McArthur Court.
STANFORD is looking for their
third straight victory, beating
Ford ham, 59-44, last week and

dropping the Golden Bears of [
California, 53-52, last Tuesday. ,
Oregon is trying to return to j
the* winning ways of their 1959-60
season when they compiled a 20-8
record. The high point of Coach :
Sieve quint's season thus
far is a fourth place finish in the
Far West Classic, an eight-team
holiday tournament played in i
Portland.
Last week the Ducks edged
Idaho, then turned about and took

a solid trouncing from Ihe upstart
Vandals.
PACING the sporadic Oregon
attack is (i-4 forward Charlie War
ren. Warren has hit for more
than 20 points on several occa
sions this season and was an nil
tourney pick at the Far West af
fair.
Big man on the north squad last
year, 6-7 center Glenn Moore gar
nered more than 3D counters in
one of the Oregon-Idaho games,
but has been unable to measure
up to his consistent performances
of last season.
Rounding out the starting five
for Coach Belko are Denny St rick
land, a 6-5 guard who had previ
ously played at the forward slot,
6-4 forward Bill Simmons and
Butch Kimpton, a 6-1 guard who
had been a reserve for two sea
sons.
INDIAN mentor Howie Dall
mar is hoping for another good
shooting night from John Hendry,
who combined with forward John
Windsor and guard Bub Bowling
to provide the firepower required
to sink the Bears.
A losing streak during Christ
mas holiday play has hurt the In
dians' season record; after beat
ing Utah early in December, the
locals won only one more fray
before trouncing Fordham. That
gives them a 4-6 mark—a win
over the Ducks will leave them
just one shy of the .500 level.
