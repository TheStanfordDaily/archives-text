## 
### 
Southern California's John Ru
dometkin jumped into Ihe AAWII
basketball scoring lead after the
first week of action as Ihe 6-6
junior forward hit for 39 points
on 16 field goals and seven free
throws in two games for a 19.5
per game average.
CLOSE behind, on ihe basis of
a blazing eight for 13 from the
field against Cal. came Stanford's
veteran forward, 6-3 John Hen
dry. Hendry also added two coun
ters from the charity line for an
18-point per game mark.
p]ail Schultz, California guard;
SC's Ken Stanley and Clint Names
of the Washington Huskies fol
lowed in the scoring column while
Rub Bowling was the only other
Indian among Ihe top ten, aver
aging 11 points.
Hendry was second in the
league in another category field
goal accuracy. John hit on .615'
of his shots. Bill Hanson of Wash
ington topped the Big Five in this
respect, canning an amazing .778
of his field attempts. Rudomet
kin followed with Names, Stanley
and Verne Ashby of SC all firing
at a .500 percentage or better.
NAMES recorded a perfect eight
for eight from the foul line for
leadership in the charity race;
Shultz, Lyle Bakken of Washing
ton and John Berberich of UCLA
were second, third and fifth re
spectively. Bowling converted
nine of his 11 chances for an .818
mark and fourth spot.
Bill McClintock, rugged Cal for
ward, had a big edge on his re
bounding rivals, grabbing 40 off
the boards, more than twice the
total of runnerup Stanley. UCLA
showed good team depth in Ihe
rebound department wilh three
Bruins listed among the top five.
TEAMWISE, Stanford tops the
league in defense. However, the
Indians aren't running away from
the others in point-limiting as all
five teams have held opponents to
less than 60 points per game.
Southern Cal is the only Big
Five quint to average more than
60 points per game on offense,
and that gives them a three coun
ter bulge over runner-up Wash
ington.
Stanford trails in the next to
last spot in team offense and is
third in team rebounding.
SC lead« league standings with

two wins and no losses, Stanford
follows with a lone win in their
only start and Cal is solidly en
trenched in the cellar compiling
a no-win, three-loss mark in
AAWU.
Stanford ranks behind South
ern Cal and Washington in field
goal accuracy; the Indians are
•second only to Washington in ef
fectiveness from the foul line.
