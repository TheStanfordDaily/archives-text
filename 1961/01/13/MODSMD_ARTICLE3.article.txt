# Farm Scientist To Visit Soviet Telescopes
## 
### 
Professor Ronald N. Bracewell,
Stanford radio astronomer, will
' visit Russia next week to inspect
i Soviet radio telescopes. He will
I serve as one of two U.S. observ-
I ers participating in a scientific ex
change program sponsored by the
National Science Academies of
the United States and the Soviet
i Union.
i He will be accompanied by Pro
: fessor George Swenson of the
University of Illinois in his inspec
tion of radio telescopes, particu
larly new and unusual types, at
various Russian research centers.
The professors' itinerary will in
-1 elude Moscow, Leningrad, Sim
: ferpol in Crimea, Byurakanin in
j Armenia, Abastuman in Georgia,
Serpukhov. Gorky, and Pulkovo.
i Bracewell is particularly inter
j ested in seeing a new 70-foot para
j boloid radio telescope antenna and
ja mile-long "trough-type" anten
na. both at Serpukhov.
The 70-foot dish has a mirror
smooth metal surface, machined
to line tolerances for reception
,of millimeter waves radio waves
about ten times shorter than most
, U.S. radio telescopes can receive.
