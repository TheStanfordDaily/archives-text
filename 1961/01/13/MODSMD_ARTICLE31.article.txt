## 
### 
Harry R. Lange, vice president
of Cutter Laboratories in Berke
ley, has given Stanford Univer
sity's Music Department a $50,000
collection of historical mu-sical
instruments.
A violinist himself, Lange is
president of the Oakland Sym
phony Orchestra Association. He
is also a consulting professor of
accounting at Stanford's Gradu
ate School of Business.
His gift of antique and modern
copies of old instruments is a
working collection for the use of
qualified students and faculty.
The instruments have been used
repeatedly during the past three
years, while the donor remained
anonymous.
Professor Sandor Salgo, conduc
tor of Stanford's symphony and
chamber orchestras, describes the
gift as "superb." lie says, "II has
given us the opportunity of bring
ing together really superior in
struments and performers."
"And," Salgo continued, "the
gift comes at a time of world
wide quickening of interest in
Renaissance and Baroque music.
Some of the historical pieces give
Stanford the tools for increased
participation in this reawaken
ing."
In great measure inspired by
Lange's gift, Stanford's Music
Department is planning a Renais
sance and Baroque Institute sum
mer quarter. For professional and
student performers, it will be
given under the direction of Pro
fessor Putnam Aldrich July 24
to Aug. 19.
"The Harry R. Lange Historical
Collection of Musical Instruments
and Books" includes violins from
such makers as Francesco Stradi
varius (son of Antonio), Jacob
Stainer, Nicolas Lupot, Kendrick
Jacobs, and George Gemunder.
His most recent addition to the
growing collection a December
gift includes six fine violins and
bows, an 18th century mandolin,
a pochette (the pocket-sized violin
of 18th century dancing masters),
six violas and bows, and an early
Italian cello and bow.
