VIENTIANE, Laos (UPI >
Four planes supplied to the Lao
tian Air Force under the Ameri
can aid program attacked Com
munist position with bombs and
rockets for the second time yes
terday. The strike appeared to
herald a government counter
offensive.
The attacks raised speculation
in some Western circles over pos
sible Communist retaliatory ac
tion which might include use of
fighter planes to protect Russian
aircraft flying supplies into the
same area.
(IN MOSCOW, Premier Nikita
Khrushchev accused tho United
States of "provacative actions"
leading to "direct intervention"
in Laos and called for an East-
West conference on the conflict.)
Government sources disclosed
its planes, World War II T-6
train e r s manned by French
trained Loatians, arrived Jan. 10
and made their first attack as
Laos warned Russia it would take
"appropriate action" against So
viet transport planes flying sup
plies to the rebels.
TIIKRK WAS no indication the
planes might attack the trans
port which were reported still
active. Yesterday a Soviet biplane
was reported directing Commu
nist artillery fire for the Pathet
Laos rebels.
The Communist mortar posi
tions on the Plain of Jars were
reported holding up the start of
a government counter-offensive
led by Gen. Phoumi Nosavan.
Wednesday's rocket attack by the
inexperienced fliers was reported
unsuccessful. There was no word
on yesterday's attack.
