# Students Form Russian Club
## 
### 
Growing interest in Russian
culture and language has resulted
in the recent establishment of
Russki Kruzhok. Russian Conver
sation Club at Stanford.
Last October, Ivan Stenboek-
Fermor of the Russian Depart
ment and interested students ini
tiated the club. The main purpose
of the club is to promote profi
ciency in the spoken language.
Russki Kruzhok is planning a
variety of programs for the new
year including professors and
guests of Russian background and
a program of Russian folk music
by members of the Russian Choir
of the Army Language School at
Monterey.
Meetings are held weekly, Fri
day at 4:30 p.m. in the Women's
Clubhouse. Any person of Russian
speaking ability is invited to
attend.
