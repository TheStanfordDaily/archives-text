# Ike Challenges Kennedy In Farewell Address
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) President Eisenhower said yesterday
he was leaving John F. Kennedy with some explosive foreign and
domestic problems bui declared they could be solved if the incoming)
president tackles them with "steadfast resolution."
In a farewell State of the Union message to Congress, Eisenhower j

! said the nation had reached "un
precedented heights" during the
eight years of his administration.
He cited 12 general areas in which
he said specific objectives had
been reached.
EISENHOWER said the United
| States unquestionably was ahead
:in space exploration "for the
betterment of mankind." He also
j said his "rewarding" trips over
seas were so successful they
I forced Soviet Premier Nikita
| Khrushchev to cancel the summit
j conference last May.
But he acknowledged in his j
I valedictory that he could not say 1
I "All is well—that all problems are !
solved." He pointed to the "ex
plosive situation" in Laos, Com- j
munist penetration of Cuba, and
unemployment at home, among
i ot hers.
The president did not deliver
! his message in person. Instead he
i sent it to the House where it was !
read by a clerk. The Senate, in j
' recess today, will hear it tomor- j
i row. But the White House an- !
; nounced that Eisenhower will de
! liver a farewell radio-TV speech
I to the nation Tuesday night.
THE PRESIDENT d evot e d
nearly all of his message to a re
view of his administration rather!
than to proposals for future ac- j
tion. He offered only one sugges- j
tion which could be interpreted as j
la recommendation to Kennedy—
I no recognition for Red China.
He said this "belligerent and
unrepentant nation" had yet to j
.demonstrate that it deserves to,
I be considered a "peace-loving" na
{tion worthy of recognition by this
country or admission to the j
: United Nations.
On the home front, he said the
| economy is "operating at high
levels" but there is "little room 1
j for complacency." He said unem- j
ployment rates are "higher than
i any of us would like, and chronic
! pockets of high unemployment
| persist."
However, He prayerfully ex
tended best wishes to Kennedy
and said that success in solving
such problems "can only come
from a steadfast resolution that j
integrity in the operation of gov
ernment and in our relations with
each other bo fully maintained."

ployment rates are "higher than
i any of us would like, and chronic
! pockets of high unemployment

However, He prayerfully ex
tended best wishes to Kennedy
and said that success in solving
such problems "can only come
from a steadfast resolution that j
integrity in the operation of gov
ernment and in our relations with
each other bo fully maintained."
WASHINGTON (UPI) President Eisenhower said yesterday
he was leaving John F. Kennedy with some explosive foreign and
domestic problems bui declared they could be solved if the incoming)
president tackles them with "steadfast resolution."
In a farewell State of the Union message to Congress, Eisenhower j

! said the nation had reached "un
precedented heights" during the
eight years of his administration.
He cited 12 general areas in which
he said specific objectives had
been reached.
EISENHOWER said the United
| States unquestionably was ahead
:in space exploration "for the
betterment of mankind." He also
j said his "rewarding" trips over
seas were so successful they
I forced Soviet Premier Nikita
| Khrushchev to cancel the summit
j conference last May.
But he acknowledged in his j
I valedictory that he could not say 1
I "All is well—that all problems are !
solved." He pointed to the "ex
plosive situation" in Laos, Com- j
munist penetration of Cuba, and
unemployment at home, among
i ot hers.
The president did not deliver
! his message in person. Instead he
i sent it to the House where it was !
read by a clerk. The Senate, in j
' recess today, will hear it tomor- j
i row. But the White House an- !
; nounced that Eisenhower will de
! liver a farewell radio-TV speech
I to the nation Tuesday night.
THE PRESIDENT d evot e d
nearly all of his message to a re
view of his administration rather!
than to proposals for future ac- j
tion. He offered only one sugges- j
tion which could be interpreted as j
la recommendation to Kennedy—
I no recognition for Red China.
He said this "belligerent and
unrepentant nation" had yet to j
.demonstrate that it deserves to,
I be considered a "peace-loving" na
{tion worthy of recognition by this
country or admission to the j
: United Nations.
On the home front, he said the
| economy is "operating at high
levels" but there is "little room 1
j for complacency." He said unem- j
ployment rates are "higher than
i any of us would like, and chronic
! pockets of high unemployment
