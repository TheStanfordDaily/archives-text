# Berger Claims U.S. Jews Not Tied to Israel
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
7'he United States government
should protect her Jewish citizens
against the Zionist movement to
force them to be citizens of Israel,
according to Dr. Elmer Berger,
who spoke yesterday afternoon in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
"Foreign Policy by Dereliction,"
the title of his talk, was the term
he applied to the United States
acquiescence to the Israeli con
cept of hyphenated citizenship for
American Jews.
"I KNOW,"he said, "that in
too many places in American life
the foreign nationalism which
gave birth to the State of Israel
is treated as a 'sacred cow' be
cause it is regarded as a part of
the religious disciplines of a num
ber of American citizens."
Too many people fail to realize,
according to Berger, that "Juda
ism is a religion and not a na
tionality."
Berger asked American citizens
to be "realistic" in their evalua
tion of Israel and Zionism. Israel
is trying to get the legal rights
of citizenship from all Jews.
ISRAEL also claims that she
represents all Jews, when she in
tervenes on their behalf although
they are citizens of another na
tion, and when she places Eich
mann on trial "on the ground that
Israel is the only 'sovereign au
thority in Jewery.'"
Using International Zionism and
the United Jewish Appeal, Israel
tries to get the sympathies and
money of Jews who are not under
the legal jurisdiction of Israel,
according to Berger.
Berger believes that Israel's
Premier David Ben-Gurion is try
ing to do what no state can do:
demand the loyalty of American
Jewry just because they believe
in the Jewish faith.
As executive vice-president of
the American Council for Juda
ism, Berger explained that the
Council "was founded in 1943 to
affirm that Americans of Jewish
faith have no national rights or
obligations except as equal, re
sponsible citizens of the United
States."
