### 
An ex-Castro diplomat and a U.S. State Department expert on
Latin America are slated for talks at Stanford this week and next.
Luis A. Baralt Jr., who quit as Cuban ambassador to Canada last
June, will speak at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow in Cubberley Auditorium.
Richard I. Phillips, public affairs adviser in the State Department's

Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, j
will speak next Monday at the i
same hour and place.
TIILIK appearance is part of a '
"Cuba Now" program arranged i
by the Institute of International!
Relations in cooperation with
Stanford's Committee on Public
Exercises. Senior Robert S. Wood !
heads the arrangements group.
The ex-Cuban ambassador, Ba-j
rait, held a diplomatic post as 1
early as 1952. He resigned after
the coup of Castro's predecessor.!
Batista, and cooperated with Cas- j
tro's revolutionary movement.'
From 1952-59 he was an editor for
the Reader's Digest Spanish edi
tion.
Baralt reportedly makes no dis
tinction between the dictatorships
of Batista and Castro. Both, he
says, are using the same classic i
techniques of demagoguery.
"There will be a revolt against
Castro within the year," he is 1
quoted as saying at a recent con- i
ference in San Francisco. Less
than 50 per cent of Cuban people |
are behind Castro now. he said.
PHILLIPS has been a foreign ;
service officer since 1946. He
earlier had been associated with
a Buenos Aires law firm, and
during World War II represented j
the Coordinator of Inter-Ameri
can Affairs in Montevideo, Uru
guay.
He has served in the Montevi- ;
deo and Caracas embassies, and !
as American Consul in Nairobi
and Guadalajara. He has attended |
several international conferences
as a U.S. delegate.
