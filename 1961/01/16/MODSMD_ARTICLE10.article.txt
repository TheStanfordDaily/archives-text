### 
ELISABETHVILLE, The Congo (UPI> — Rampaging Baluba
tribesmen attacked two U.N.-escorted trains in the Katanga Province
bush country yesterday and battled Moroccan and Swedish train
guards in a firefight that continued through the day.
At least three Swedes wore reported wounded in the clash. One,

a major, was reported in serious
condition. Baluba casualties were
not known.
REPORTS from northern Ka
tanga Province said an unidenti
fied European doctor suffered se
rious injuries when the hospital
ho was working in at the coal
mining center of Luena was at
tacked by Balubas.
Another report from reliable
sources said U.N. Ethiopian Gen.
Mangasha Iyassou in Stanleyville
had reached agreement with pro-
Lumumba Gen. Victor Lundula to
begin negotians on the with
drawal of Lundula's troops from
Manono in northern Katanga.
The Balubas sabotaged the
tracks to force the trains to stop
near Bitkama in northern Ka
tanga, 200 miles north of the pro
vincial capital of Elisabethville.
EACH time the track was re
paired, the Balubas smashed it
again farther up the line.
The Balubas attacked the Mo
roccan-guarded train first, then
turned to fight the Swedish sol
diers when their train reached the
scene.
The Balubas, using rifles and
bows and arrows, struck from be
hind clumps of bushes.
THE Balubas apparently be
lieved the trains were carrying
Congolese troops loyal to their
sworn enemy, Katanga Provincial
President Moise Tshombe.

ters in the Congo capital of Leo
poldville reported it still was un
successful in negotiating the re

well treated.

spite demands by President Jo
seph Kasavubu that he bo recall
ed on grounds he supported forces
loyal to deposed Premier Patrice
Lumumba.

vilie wearing blazer and slacks,
but made no effort to contact
Kasavubu.
Some unrest was reported Sat
urday at the Congolese army Ko
kolo Camp in Leopoldville, but of
ficers apparently calmed down
the men and all was quiet there
yesterday.
