### KEEM STASSEN 
"I want American students to realize how badly
we have done as Americans in Africa," Chaplain
William Coffin of Yale University said yesterday,
as he explained what lie will speak about at 7:30
tonight in Cubberley Auditorium.
"1 want to tell about the need in Africa, and ex
plain why it is so acute right now. I want to pre
sent the challenge and the opportunity which
Africa offers to college students."
WIIION CHAPLAIN Coffin covers these topics,
he will be speaking from his experience as a group
leader of "Operation Crossroads Africa," which he
described as a "Work Camp Study Project in
Africa. Students have a week of orientation and
then I hey build something, a school, or a clinic, or
something."
"Operation Crossroads Africa" involved 174
students from 14 colleges and universities last
summer, which was the first summer of the proj
ect. None of them were from Stanford, although
there will be at least one Stanford student, this
summer.
While speaking about "Operation Crossroads
Africa," tlk* pipe-smoking chaplain said. "There
was an article in Look magazine about it a few
weeks ago. The whole issue was called 'Explosive

Generation.' We need some exploders," he declared.
"AFRICA DESPERATELY needs 300.000 teach
ers. That's something else I'm going to tell about
the four Yale students who are teaching in
Africa this year and what we've learned from
them. There is a two-year contract waiting for
any qualified graduate student who wants to
teach in Africa."
Chaplain Coffin showed his enthusiasm for
President-elect Kennedy's Peace Corps plan. "It's
a good thing. I've heard that Kennedy will say
something about it in his inauguration speech. The
details still have to be worked out. We don't know
whether it will count as a draft exemption or not.
"That's one reason why we are working on this
two-year teaching program in Africa. Kennedy
will have something to work with when he begins.
"I AM CONVINCED of the urgency and cru
ciality of the next 10 years," Chaplain Coffin earn
estly stated. "I told this to a friend of mine in the
Intelligence Department in Washington. 'You're
wrong.' he said. 'It's not the next 10 years that are
the crucial ones it's the next five.' "
Tonight's talk also will include something about
the role of the race crisis in Africa, about United
Stales and Soviet propaganda, and "how the So
viets are winning the propaganda war."

two-year teaching program in Africa. Kennedy
will have something to work with when he begins.
"I AM CONVINCED of the urgency and cru
ciality of the next 10 years," Chaplain Coffin earn
estly stated. "I told this to a friend of mine in the
Intelligence Department in Washington. 'You're
wrong.' he said. 'It's not the next 10 years that are
the crucial ones it's the next five.' "
Tonight's talk also will include something about
the role of the race crisis in Africa, about United
Stales and Soviet propaganda, and "how the So
viets are winning the propaganda war."
"I want American students to realize how badly
we have done as Americans in Africa," Chaplain
William Coffin of Yale University said yesterday,
as he explained what lie will speak about at 7:30
tonight in Cubberley Auditorium.
"1 want to tell about the need in Africa, and ex
plain why it is so acute right now. I want to pre
sent the challenge and the opportunity which
Africa offers to college students."
WIIION CHAPLAIN Coffin covers these topics,
he will be speaking from his experience as a group
leader of "Operation Crossroads Africa," which he
described as a "Work Camp Study Project in
Africa. Students have a week of orientation and
then I hey build something, a school, or a clinic, or
something."
"Operation Crossroads Africa" involved 174
students from 14 colleges and universities last
summer, which was the first summer of the proj
ect. None of them were from Stanford, although

was an article in Look magazine about it a few
weeks ago. The whole issue was called 'Explosive

Generation.' We need some exploders," he declared.
"AFRICA DESPERATELY needs 300.000 teach
ers. That's something else I'm going to tell about
the four Yale students who are teaching in
Africa this year and what we've learned from
them. There is a two-year contract waiting for
any qualified graduate student who wants to
teach in Africa."
Chaplain Coffin showed his enthusiasm for
President-elect Kennedy's Peace Corps plan. "It's
a good thing. I've heard that Kennedy will say
something about it in his inauguration speech. The
details still have to be worked out. We don't know
whether it will count as a draft exemption or not.
"That's one reason why we are working on this
two-year teaching program in Africa. Kennedy
will have something to work with when he begins.
