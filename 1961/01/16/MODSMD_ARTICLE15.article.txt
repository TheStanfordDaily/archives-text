Students at a university in a small town in Georgia will have
a chance this morning to record an important pain for the cause
of human rights, dignity and progress in the South. \\ hat should
he a welcomed opportunity will come when 18-vear-old ( Jiarlayne
Hunter and 19-vear-old Hamilton Holmes —different Iroin their
classmates only iu skin color —attempt to attend the 9 o'clock
classes for which thcv registered last week.
Much depends on the manner in which the 7.000 students at
the University of Georgia greet the two Negroes—and those stu
dents can he sure that their actions will he followed with more
than passing interest by millions of people, from Stanford to
Nigeria to Moscow.
Two courses are open for the students: they can continue
the disgraceful, senseless, saddening rioting which swept the cam
pus last Friday night—or they can accept with calm, law-abiding
Southern dignity what their own school administration, faculty
and many state legislators have come to regard as inevitable.
Seldom have students had a better opportunity to take the
lead, by their direct action, in a matter of pressing importance
to them, their community, their stale and their country. \ iolence
always is easily triggered in a tense situation —and it certainly
would recpiire little effort to turn the University of Georgia into
a duplicate of the University of Alabama during the riot-torn
days when Autherine Lucy tried to enroll there.
But we hope that an example will be set at the University
of Georgia today, an example that the rest of the South's higher
educational institutions will follow when the time comes for
integration at their campuses —as come it must. Nothing could
make more of an impression upon the people of Dixie and the
rest of the nation than for Georgia's students to quietly accept
the two new students, and to treat them the way they should he
treated—no better and no worse than any other freshman or
sophomore.
Iu this way, the Georgia U. students would have the unique
opportunity of demonstrating for all to see what they undoubt
edly have come across in their readings—that basic human rights
extend to all persons, regardless of the color of their skin.
As students firmly convinced that students can at times wield
a powerful influence over the course of events iu this nation, we
anxiously await the reaction at the Georgia U. this morning. It
is not often that students, who normally cannot vote and are not
organized into effective organizations, have the power to control
such an important decision.
Students have that power in Athens, Ga., this morning. We
hope they use it wisely.

Students have that power in Athens, Ga., this morning. We
hope they use it wisely.
Students at a university in a small town in Georgia will have
a chance this morning to record an important pain for the cause
of human rights, dignity and progress in the South. \\ hat should
he a welcomed opportunity will come when 18-vear-old ( Jiarlayne
Hunter and 19-vear-old Hamilton Holmes —different Iroin their
classmates only iu skin color —attempt to attend the 9 o'clock
classes for which thcv registered last week.
Much depends on the manner in which the 7.000 students at
the University of Georgia greet the two Negroes—and those stu
dents can he sure that their actions will he followed with more
than passing interest by millions of people, from Stanford to
Nigeria to Moscow.
Two courses are open for the students: they can continue
the disgraceful, senseless, saddening rioting which swept the cam
pus last Friday night—or they can accept with calm, law-abiding
Southern dignity what their own school administration, faculty
and many state legislators have come to regard as inevitable.
Seldom have students had a better opportunity to take the
lead, by their direct action, in a matter of pressing importance
to them, their community, their stale and their country. \ iolence
always is easily triggered in a tense situation —and it certainly
would recpiire little effort to turn the University of Georgia into
a duplicate of the University of Alabama during the riot-torn
days when Autherine Lucy tried to enroll there.
But we hope that an example will be set at the University
of Georgia today, an example that the rest of the South's higher
educational institutions will follow when the time comes for
integration at their campuses —as come it must. Nothing could
make more of an impression upon the people of Dixie and the
rest of the nation than for Georgia's students to quietly accept
the two new students, and to treat them the way they should he
treated—no better and no worse than any other freshman or
sophomore.
Iu this way, the Georgia U. students would have the unique
opportunity of demonstrating for all to see what they undoubt
edly have come across in their readings—that basic human rights
extend to all persons, regardless of the color of their skin.
As students firmly convinced that students can at times wield
a powerful influence over the course of events iu this nation, we
anxiously await the reaction at the Georgia U. this morning. It
is not often that students, who normally cannot vote and are not
organized into effective organizations, have the power to control
such an important decision.
