## Why Ignored?

"Dinkelspiel Auditorium was
never designed for what it is now
being used for." When designer
Arch Lauterer died before the
building was completed, he left
behind an outstanding theater
building but many unanswered
questions, according to Bill Cleve
land, the Music Department's resi
dent stage manager.
Although 500 different angles
of light are possible, the built-in
positions for the equipment pre
sent several problems, Cleveland
continued. Lauterer favored work
ing with pools of light rather than
the overall lighting preferred by
most traveling companies. And
general overall lighting is hard to
achieve in Dinkelspiel, so far as
front lighting is concerned.
According to Cleveland, the
foremost problem is that "there
are no facilities at all for side
lighting," the lighting desired by
most of the visiting performers
and companies who appear on the
Dinkelspiel stage.
Provisions for side-lighting
could be installed fairly easily, he
added, but the problem arises as
to who would pay for this, the
Music Department or the Univer
sity, on the basis that present
Music Department productions do
not require such lighting.
The facilities are perfect for
current Music Department proj
ects such as orchestra and cham
ber music concerts as well as for
lectures. But "there is no flexi
bility in the lighting at the present
time."
The design of the overhead
organ loft is the biggest contribu
tor to this problem. Sixteen in
struments are currently there,
placed between narrow louvres, or
wooden slats, on the front of the
loft. Because of these inflexible
positions, cross-lighting is diffi
cult to achieve and use effectively.
This could bo solved, however, by
removing every second louvre.
"It is difficult to know exactly
how Lauterer wanted the lights
used." Cleveland said, "as most

traveling companies are prosce
nium workers." That is, they do
not use the covered orchestra pit
area for which most of the light
ing was designed—the area which
was foremost in Lauterer's con
ception of modern theater.
The absence of a stage loft pre
sents problems, too, as this costly
tower which Lauterer shunned "is
invaluable for a theater'that has
to be used for many things." If
stage settings are used they must
ho much more complete than con
ventional box sets; the first row
of seats practically encircles the
downstage area, and there is an
intimacy unknown in proscenium
theaters.
However, these problems could
he eliminated if the building were
used for those things which Lau
terer had in mind. "Experimental
theater is just exactly what Dink
elspiel is built for, Cleveland's
lighting assistant Judy Shrader
said.
"If we went to the trouble of de
signing forestage productions, the
theater should be used for this,"
Cleveland added. "But the only
way we can find out what we
really can do with Dinkelspiel is
to have a director at Stanford for
several years and do a show every
quarter."
A man of three talents is really
necessary for this, according to
John Planting, secretary-manager
of the auditorium: a director
technician combination who could
also teach opera production.
One of the biggest cost prob
lems of* a large-scale production
by the Music Department (such
as "Count Ory" several years ago)
is securing technical and stage di
rectors and backstagc crews.
Eventually, as soon as finances
can be secured, the Music Depart
ment hopes to bring in just such
a resident director. But in the
meantime there is no reason why
Dinkelspiel needs to remain one
of the most magnificent and most
ignored theater buildings in the
country.
