Editor, The Daily:
I found Miss K. Stassen's ac
count of Rabbi Elmer Berger's
anti-Zionist Manifesto (Daily, Jan.
13) somewhat too uncritical. I
should like to offer the following
points for your readers' consider
ation, lest they read Mr. Berger's
words as Gospel truth.
(1) Miss Stassen's report
opens: "The United States govern
ment should protect her Jewish
citizens against the Zionist move
ment to force them to be citizens
of Israel." How could Mr. Berger
who evidently regards the Zion
ists as a sneaky and cunning
breed, attribute to them such an
impossibly ridiculous attitude?
As a citizen of Israel I might arid
that we Israelis have at least that
much false dignity to regard the
citizenship in our country as a
privilege, and not as something
that we ought to coerce innocent
victims into accepting.
(2) The above quotation makes
it appear as if Mr. Berger and
the organization which he repre
sents are unselfishly devoted to
the sacred task of protecting the
mutilated rights of American
Jews. As is well known, Jewish
members of the Armed Forces are
not permitted to serve in certain
bases in the Middle East. It is not
clear to me why Rabbi Berger
does not make it a point to go and
preach to King Saud that Judaism
is merely a religion, not a na
j tionality.
(3> "Judaism is a religion, not
a nationality a statement that
every man in his right senses
should subscribe to." But how does
this statement imply that it is
illegitimate for one member of a
faith to join with another member
of the same faith in a mutual ef
fort? If you follow Mr. Berger's
(rationale, you must conclude that
! what happened, say, in Germany
during and before World War 11.
was strictly a German internal
problem: Germans killing Ger
mans (the latter happening to be
of Jewish faith.) Somehow, those
who did the killing did not seem
to see it this way.
(4> Israel has never claimed
that she represented all Jews.
When a wave of Swastikas breaks
out and Rabbi Berger remains
silent, it stays up to the Israelis
to voice their protests. Similarly,
Eichmann is placed on trial in
Israel precisely because Rabbi
Berger and others like him did
nothing to place him on trial else
where.
(5) "... Israel tries to get the
sympathies and money of the
Jews who are not under her legal
jurisdiction." To this charge I
would plead guilty. However, it
is here that Rabbi Berger does
exactly what he preaches against:
He claims to talk in the name of
sympathies and money of all
Jews. Rabbi Berger's sympathies
are with the "friends of the Mid
dle East" and presumably there
goes his money. Other "members
of his faith" sympathize with Is
rael and Israel is where their
money goes.
(6) Finally, I have not heard
that Israel's prime minister has
ever tried to talk Rabbi Berger
into loyalty to the Stale of Israel.
Mr. Ben Gurion has his own views
as to why it was in the long run
I interest of Jews to come to Israel,
but whenever he expressed those
views, it was always in an ad
dress to Zionist audiences, to peo

pie already sick with the fatal
plague.
Menahem E. Yaari
Editor, The Daily:
There has recently been much
space devoted to Dr. Elmer Berger
and the Council for Judiasm. It is
only fair that the Council be given
its proper significance.
Dr. Berger claims an active
membership of 20,000. This repre
sents only two-tenths of 1 per
cent of the five and one-half mil
lion American Jews! The Zionist
organization has an active mem
bership of 500,00 and the prepon
derance of the rest of American
Jewry is pro-Zionist, as is attested
to by the overwhelming moral
and financial suport of Israel and
what it represents.
Local evidence of this fact was
the criticism levelled at Dr. Ber
ger last night (Jan. 12), a criti
cism conspicuously absent in Miss
Stassen's coverage of the talk.
Hence, the Council, representing
a vanishing fraction of American
Jewry, should be given the neg
ligible attention it deserves.
More fundamentally. Berger's
key claim lhat the Jews are a re
ligion and not a people is pure
fantasy. Any student of the Old
Testament is aware that God
promised Abraham to make his
offspring "a great nation."
The Hebrew translated means
"nation" or "people" and not "re
ligion." Hence Jews ARE historic
ally a people, and Berger has no
right speaking in ihe name of
something he doesn't even repre
sent. It is unfortunate, indeed,
that a group, representing the di
rect opposite of thought of the
vast majority of Jews should
claim to be Jews at all. These
people are Jews neither by tradi
tion or in essence.
A. Soudack
Editor, The Daily:
I am deeply grateful to The
Daily for having published, in its
issue of May 20, the bulk of my
testimony before the House Com
mittee on Un-American Activities
in San Francisco. However, I un
derstand that a showing of the
film, "Operation Abolition," has
recently been given on campus.
That film refers to me bv name

as a "Communist propagandist
who serves the conspiracy in the
fields of radio and television. I
would therefore like to request
publication in The Daily of the
following further excerpts from
my testimony under oath, not
published on May 20:
"Q. Do you have present infor
mation respecting the operation
of the criminal conspiracy dedi
cated to the overthrow of this
government by force and violence,
which criminal conspiracy is rep
resented on American soil, in part,
by that entity known as the Com
munist Party?
"A. My answer is no, sir. . . .
"Q. Do you know from personal
experience in closed Communist
Party meetings the identification
of persons who to your certain
knowledge are now or in the re
cent past have been members of
the Communist Party active in
Northern California?"
"A. My answer is no. . . ."
William Mandel
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to propose that
The Daily set aside a special
"humor" page 1o contain such
items as "Little Man on the Cam
pus" and the music criticism.
