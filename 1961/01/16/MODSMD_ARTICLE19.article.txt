Editor, The Daily:
Last Wednesday evening, large
ly out of curiosity, I attended a
motion picture and panel debate
discussing the House Committee
on Un-American Activities. After
witnessing the film "Operation
Abolition," produced by this com
mittee on the San Francisco riot,
and the discussion which followed
it, I was struck with the lack of
any real defense of the commit
tee.
Certainly, all the members of
the panel wished the defeat of
communism, but it also appeared
that no one was seriously defend
ing the committee, let alone the
movie. I propose that Stanford
University or some organization
of it invile the committee to pro
vide us with a speaker officially
representing it, preferably a mem
ber who will defend specifically,
those, purposes, actions and ac
complishments of the committee
and its film.
If possible, another debate
could be organized, or else it
could simply be arranged to an
swer questions from the floor. If
the committee does not then pro
vide a speaker, or if the speaker
fails to answer satisfactorily ques
tions about the reasons for the
film and its adherence, or lack of
it, to the facts, a petition objecting
to the picture "Operation Aboli
tion" should be submitted to the
House of Representatives by
Stanford University as an insti
tution on the grounds that it
places the students of this school
(and even more of the students
of the University of California) in
an extremely bad light by its un
fair and ineffectively crude meth
ods of propaganda.
I realize that this is a task for
the ASSU, but in the past there
has been much opposition to pre
senting the views of the students
of Stanford officially on interna
tional and national events on the
ground that they don't directly
concern us. However, it is to my
mind impossible to doubt Ihat
this film effects the University
directly.
Therefore, the organization rep
resenting the Stanford .student
body should definitely take a posi
tive course of act ion to try to avert
the false and degrading impres
sion given by this film of the
part played by students, some of
them from Stanford, in the San
Francisco riots of last year. This
may be done by the procedure
suggested here.
Patricia MeC.auley
Editor, The Daily:
The Jan. 11 Daily carried a re
print of an editorial from the
Washington Post dealing with
fraternities and. to some extent,
other issues. By reprinting the
editorial you indicated that you
agree with it in general so this
will be a reply to you in particular
rather than one of principle.
In the past few years the fra
ternity system has been strongly
criticized by many persons, both
scholars and nonscholars, fratern
ity men and non-fraternity men.
Like any other criticism these
should be judged not on what is
said but why it is said. The edi
torial contained no basis for the
criticisms and I don't believe you
have a thorough enough knowl
edge of the fraternity system to
qualify you as either a supporter
or a critic.
One of the first comments con
cerned ''the elaborate initiation
ritual with hooded figures made
mysterious by candlelight." Are
you acquainted with the constitu
tions of all the national fraterni

ties to the extent that you know
how many fraternities have this?
And do you know what is con
tained in the fraternity rituals
themselves?
Without this knowledge you
have no cause for comment on
rituals. What is the basis for the
race, religion and social status
comment? I can give you any
number of examples of Near East
ern and Asian exchange students
being initiated into national fra
ternities and it is safe to assume
that by the end of this summer
several fraternity constitutions
will have their race restrictions
entirely removed.
If you studied the religious re
quirements you would find a basis
for your accusation in that area,
as most fraternities have a Chris
tianity requirement. The common
charge of "Protestantism" is sim
ply false, as some chapters of the
largest fraternities are over 50
per cent Catholic. Fraternity
members from all over the coun
try are drawn from every walk of
life, and many of them sponsor
scholarships for persons who
can't afford an education.
There are two things to remem
ber when discussing fraternities.
You should be acquainted with the
national constitutions and the ex
tent to which they are followed by
a variety of chapters, and one
chapter or all the chapters of one
school should not be used alone
as examples of fraternities in
general.
Your reply to Malcolm Fitzpat
rick in Jan. 12 justified your stand
on the other subjects of the edi
torial. Now either you or another
Daily staff member should do
some extensive study on the pros
and cons of the fraternity ques
tion and then go ahead and give
some well-founded criticism or
praise. Such a study might be
good for both sides.

Patricia MeC.auley
Editor, The Daily:
The Jan. 11 Daily carried a re
print of an editorial from the
Washington Post dealing with
fraternities and. to some extent,
other issues. By reprinting the
editorial you indicated that you
agree with it in general so this
will be a reply to you in particular
rather than one of principle.
In the past few years the fra
ternity system has been strongly
criticized by many persons, both
scholars and nonscholars, fratern
ity men and non-fraternity men.
Like any other criticism these
should be judged not on what is
said but why it is said. The edi
torial contained no basis for the
criticisms and I don't believe you
have a thorough enough knowl
edge of the fraternity system to
qualify you as either a supporter
or a critic.
One of the first comments con
cerned ''the elaborate initiation
ritual with hooded figures made
mysterious by candlelight." Are
you acquainted with the constitu
tions of all the national fraterni

ties to the extent that you know
how many fraternities have this?
And do you know what is con
tained in the fraternity rituals
themselves?
Without this knowledge you
have no cause for comment on
rituals. What is the basis for the
race, religion and social status
comment? I can give you any
number of examples of Near East
ern and Asian exchange students
being initiated into national fra
ternities and it is safe to assume
that by the end of this summer
several fraternity constitutions
will have their race restrictions
entirely removed.
If you studied the religious re
quirements you would find a basis
for your accusation in that area,
as most fraternities have a Chris
tianity requirement. The common
charge of "Protestantism" is sim
ply false, as some chapters of the
largest fraternities are over 50
per cent Catholic. Fraternity
members from all over the coun
try are drawn from every walk of
life, and many of them sponsor
scholarships for persons who
can't afford an education.
There are two things to remem
ber when discussing fraternities.
You should be acquainted with the
national constitutions and the ex
tent to which they are followed by
a variety of chapters, and one
chapter or all the chapters of one
school should not be used alone
as examples of fraternities in
general.
Your reply to Malcolm Fitzpat
rick in Jan. 12 justified your stand
on the other subjects of the edi
torial. Now either you or another
Daily staff member should do
some extensive study on the pros
and cons of the fraternity ques
tion and then go ahead and give
some well-founded criticism or
praise. Such a study might be
good for both sides.
Fred Nelson
Editor, The Daily:
Last Wednesday evening, large
ly out of curiosity, I attended a
motion picture and panel debate
discussing the House Committee
on Un-American Activities. After
witnessing the film "Operation
Abolition," produced by this com
mittee on the San Francisco riot,
and the discussion which followed
it, I was struck with the lack of
any real defense of the commit
tee.
Certainly, all the members of
the panel wished the defeat of
communism, but it also appeared
that no one was seriously defend
ing the committee, let alone the
movie. I propose that Stanford
University or some organization
of it invile the committee to pro
vide us with a speaker officially
representing it, preferably a mem
ber who will defend specifically,
those, purposes, actions and ac
complishments of the committee
and its film.
If possible, another debate
could be organized, or else it
could simply be arranged to an
swer questions from the floor. If
the committee does not then pro
vide a speaker, or if the speaker
fails to answer satisfactorily ques
tions about the reasons for the
film and its adherence, or lack of
it, to the facts, a petition objecting
to the picture "Operation Aboli
tion" should be submitted to the
House of Representatives by
Stanford University as an insti
tution on the grounds that it
places the students of this school
(and even more of the students
of the University of California) in
an extremely bad light by its un
fair and ineffectively crude meth
ods of propaganda.
I realize that this is a task for
the ASSU, but in the past there
has been much opposition to pre
senting the views of the students
of Stanford officially on interna
tional and national events on the
ground that they don't directly
concern us. However, it is to my
mind impossible to doubt Ihat
this film effects the University
directly.
Therefore, the organization rep
resenting the Stanford .student
body should definitely take a posi
tive course of act ion to try to avert
the false and degrading impres
sion given by this film of the
part played by students, some of
them from Stanford, in the San
Francisco riots of last year. This

life, and many of them sponsor
scholarships for persons who
can't afford an education.
There are two things to remem
ber when discussing fraternities.
You should be acquainted with the
national constitutions and the ex
tent to which they are followed by
a variety of chapters, and one
chapter or all the chapters of one
school should not be used alone
as examples of fraternities in
general.
Your reply to Malcolm Fitzpat
rick in Jan. 12 justified your stand
on the other subjects of the edi
torial. Now either you or another
Daily staff member should do
some extensive study on the pros
and cons of the fraternity ques
tion and then go ahead and give
some well-founded criticism or
praise. Such a study might be
good for both sides.
Fred Nelson
Editor, The Daily:
Last Wednesday evening, large
ly out of curiosity, I attended a
motion picture and panel debate
discussing the House Committee
on Un-American Activities. After
witnessing the film "Operation
Abolition," produced by this com
mittee on the San Francisco riot,
and the discussion which followed
it, I was struck with the lack of
any real defense of the commit
tee.
Certainly, all the members of
the panel wished the defeat of
communism, but it also appeared
that no one was seriously defend
ing the committee, let alone the
movie. I propose that Stanford
University or some organization
of it invile the committee to pro
vide us with a speaker officially
representing it, preferably a mem
ber who will defend specifically,
those, purposes, actions and ac
complishments of the committee
and its film.
If possible, another debate
could be organized, or else it
could simply be arranged to an
swer questions from the floor. If
the committee does not then pro
vide a speaker, or if the speaker
fails to answer satisfactorily ques
tions about the reasons for the
film and its adherence, or lack of
it, to the facts, a petition objecting
to the picture "Operation Aboli
tion" should be submitted to the
House of Representatives by
Stanford University as an insti
tution on the grounds that it
places the students of this school
(and even more of the students
of the University of California) in
an extremely bad light by its un
fair and ineffectively crude meth
ods of propaganda.
I realize that this is a task for
the ASSU, but in the past there
has been much opposition to pre
senting the views of the students
of Stanford officially on interna
tional and national events on the
ground that they don't directly
concern us. However, it is to my
mind impossible to doubt Ihat
this film effects the University
directly.
Therefore, the organization rep
resenting the Stanford .student
body should definitely take a posi
tive course of act ion to try to avert
the false and degrading impres
sion given by this film of the
part played by students, some of
them from Stanford, in the San
Francisco riots of last year. This
may be done by the procedure
suggested here.
Patricia MeC.auley
Editor, The Daily:
The Jan. 11 Daily carried a re
print of an editorial from the
Washington Post dealing with
fraternities and. to some extent,
other issues. By reprinting the
editorial you indicated that you
agree with it in general so this
will be a reply to you in particular
rather than one of principle.
In the past few years the fra
ternity system has been strongly
criticized by many persons, both
scholars and nonscholars, fratern
ity men and non-fraternity men.
Like any other criticism these
should be judged not on what is
said but why it is said. The edi
torial contained no basis for the
criticisms and I don't believe you
have a thorough enough knowl
edge of the fraternity system to
qualify you as either a supporter
or a critic.
One of the first comments con
cerned ''the elaborate initiation
ritual with hooded figures made
mysterious by candlelight." Are
you acquainted with the constitu
tions of all the national fraterni

ties to the extent that you know
how many fraternities have this?
And do you know what is con
tained in the fraternity rituals
themselves?
Without this knowledge you
have no cause for comment on
rituals. What is the basis for the
race, religion and social status
comment? I can give you any
number of examples of Near East
ern and Asian exchange students
being initiated into national fra
ternities and it is safe to assume
that by the end of this summer
several fraternity constitutions
will have their race restrictions
entirely removed.
If you studied the religious re
quirements you would find a basis
for your accusation in that area,
as most fraternities have a Chris
tianity requirement. The common
charge of "Protestantism" is sim
ply false, as some chapters of the
largest fraternities are over 50
per cent Catholic. Fraternity
members from all over the coun
try are drawn from every walk of
life, and many of them sponsor
scholarships for persons who
can't afford an education.
