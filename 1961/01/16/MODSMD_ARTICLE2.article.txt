## Stanford Grad Tells Of Castro 
### LIZ FREEMAN 
"I have never been so fright
ened in any country as I have
been in Cuba," opened Peter Gro
the in his talk to the Sigma Nu's
last night on "Red Hue over
Cuba."
Grot he, Stanford alumnus and
foreign relations adviser to Sen.
Hubert Humphrey, held an inter
view in Cuba with Dr. Ernesto
(Che) Guevara, whom Grothe de
scribed as "our most dangerous
opponent."
Guevara, officially recognized
as the President of the National
Bank of Cuba, also advises Cas
tro and is in charge of indoctrina
tion and economic planning.
"CAPITALISM is doomed to
death . . . the only choice is to
whether the capitalist will go out
peaceably or go out with a strug
gle," claims Guevara. Every step
that Cuba took closer to the USSR
was in reaction to measures of the
United States, Guevara says.
Grothe described the similari
ties he observed between Cuba
and European Communist coun
tries. "There is now a clear-cut
war on religion in Cuba," he said.
Communists hold key decision
making posts, and have developed
a collectivized economy. The se
cret police force is expanding, he
declared.
The Communist party is the
only legal party in Cuba. Grothe
continued, and to be anti-Commu
nist is to be counter-revolutionary.
The strongest anti-Americanism
of the Communist countries is
found in Cuba, he feels.
"YOU CAN'T withdraw from
politics . . . you are not free to
be apathetic," he described as the
Cuban people's situation. He felt
this is what determines whether
a country is Communistic or
merely a dictatorship.
He also noted differences be
tween Cuba and other Communist
countries. "There is still some
what of a freedom to travel." One
can still buy Western publica
tions, and Cuban slogans are
more "super-nationalist than pro-
Communist.
"THIS is a revolution for ex
port," he stressed, explaining the
Cuban revolution is an attempt to
stir up revolutions in other Latin
American countries. "Unless we
can do something about this, in
one year there will be four or five
more Castros in Latin America.
"I don't think it would be fair
to say that Castro is a puppet in
the Kremlin's hands at this mo
ment . . . Castro's views are
closer to that of Red China."
