# Card Ruggers Topple Peninsula Ramblers
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
The Stanford rugby squad ran roughshod over the Peninsula
Ramblers in the first half and then coasted through the second as
the Tribe easily won its first outing of the season, 20-0. here Saturday.
The Indians piled up 17 points in the first period while holding
the visitors to none to early decide the contest.
Scoring first for ihe Cards was second Hal Steuber, who made

a try from about 20 yards out
with five minutes gone. Kyrk
Reid's conversion kick was short
and wide, leaving the score 3-0 for
Stanford.
FIRST S s STAN Lindskog pro
vided the spectators with one of
the day's most spectacular plays
when he raced 65 yards for a try
flown the middle of the field mid
way in the first half, combining
speed and elusiveness to leave
Rambler tacklers grasping at thin
air.
Reid's conversion attempt was
good to hike the Indians' margin
to 110 as Reid had previously
booted a 30-yard penalty kick.
Breakaway Jack McCullough
and front ranker John Thomas
also added tries before the halt'
ended, and at halftime the score
stood at 17-0 in favor of the Tribe
ruggers.
THE LAST score of the flay
came on a fancy three-man play
about five minutes into the sec
ond half that started with Phil
Donohue and ended with Rick Me-
Millen out racing and out powering
the Ramblers for a 75-yard try.

The conversion was no good.
For the remainder of the con
test the two squads pushed each
other up and down the field, but
no further scoring threats oc
curred.
FINAL TALLIES showed Reid
as the Cards' top scorer for Ihe
day with five points on one pen
alty kick and one conversion.
Steuber, Lindskog, McCullough.
Thomas and McMillen accounted
for the rest of the Stanford point
making with one try each.
Rugby Coach Pete Kmetovic
was very pleased with his team's
play and named backs McMillen
and Lindskog as outstanding.
K3ILTOVIC ALSO called atten
tion to the fine performances of
Tom McDonald. Dick Hall and
Troy Barbee in the scrum, and
added that the Indians were com
ing along a little better than he
had expected.

Tribe ruggers will be the newly
formed San Jose Rugby Club
