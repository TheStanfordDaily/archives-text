## 
### 
Stanford's frosh and Brave bas
ketball teams won a combined to
tal of three games over the bas
ketball weekend, losing none. The
Frosh took Moffett Field, 85-67
Friday, and Hamilton Field, 84-
43, Saturday, while tho Braves
edged Moffett Field, 158-53, Satur
day.
The Braves had to scramble for
their win, in contrast to the easy
time the Frosh had on both
nights. The Braves had to fight
back from a 7-0 deficit to lie the
game 30-30 at halftime.
Some steady second half scor
ing by Bruce Loughner, Bob Whe
lan and Nels Christiensen gave
Stanford the push needed for the
victory. Loughner and W'helan
each had 15 points, while Chris
tiensen had 12.
The Frosh rode Moffett Field
to a 19-point halftime lead and
played the reserves most of the
second half. Tom Dose was high
for the Frosh with 28 points.
For Stanford fans, tlie high
light of the game was a long
hookshot by Dick Leeuwenberg,
that broke the Moffett Field Fly
ers back, and paved the way for
the Stanford win.
