## Radar Tower With 27 Aboard Disappears' 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI) — An Air Force radar tower with 27 men
aboard "disappeared" in Ihe storm-tossed Atlantic about 85 miles
southeast of New York last night and the Coast Guard here said it
presumably collapsed.
A massive air and sea search was underway for survivors.

Two navy destroyers, the first
to reach Ihe scone, reported find
ing a heavy odor of diesel oil and
gas an indication the rig with its
tons of generator equipment had
plummeted beneath the sea.
The Coast Guard said a collapse
appeared "almost definite."
The search was hampered by
winds up to 72 miles per hour and
poor visibility due to rain, sleet
and log.
The Navy carrier Wasp and at
least two Coast Guard cutters
were dispatched to the scene.
Coast Guard and Air Force planes
circled above the charted site of
the tower, known as Texas Tower
Number 4. but reported finding
"nothing."
COAST Guard spokesmen said
the planes planned to drop flares
to light up the area.
They said the Air Force at Otis
Air Force Baso in Massachusetts
reported that all contact had been
lost with the tower at 5:01 p.m.
PST.
Until then, the tower had been
reported in danger from buffeting
by high seas and gale-force winds
and the Coast Guard had been
alerted to send cutters to the
scene to removo the personnel if
necessary.
AT TIIIO time contact was lost,
the ship which normally services
the tower was 12 miles away,
struggling in heavy seas. Thirty
five foot waves were breaking at
five-second intervals.
Coast Guard headquarters here
said 15 civilian workers and 12 Air
Force men were aboard the tower.
It is known as a Texas Tower be
cause of its similarity to oil rigs
anchored along the Gulf Coast.
Basically, the tower is a radar
platform set on three legs driven
into the ocean floor in relatively
shallow water.
The station is part of the Air
Force's early warning radar de
fense system.
