# D.A. Removes Theft Charges On Strucinski
## 
### 
Charges have been dismissed in
the Santa Clara County Superior
Court against former graduate
student Mitchell Strucinski for
allegedly stealing rare books and
papers from the Stanford Library.
The district attorney's office
asked for dismissal of the case
because of "insufficient evidence"
and because Strucinski was sen
tenced to a state prison term last
week in San Mateo County Su
perior Court for stealing maps
and records from the San Mateo
County Recorder's Office.
STRUCINSKI, in a statement
to probation officer P. B. Douglas,
said he took the old maps to raise
funds to support his wife, Joanna,
who was expecting a child. She
was cleared last week in San Jose
Municipal Court of having any
part in the thefts.
County officers found tlie docu
ments missing from the Record
er's Office after Strucinski was
charged with stealing the histo
rical materials from the library.
STRUCINSKI is an ex-convict
who won a Stanford fellowship
on the strength of his writing
ability while in prison. Douglas
said a psychiatric examination
showed that Strucinski, who came
from a poor section of Chicago,
"could not accept the demands
and expectations of the outside
world after he was given recogni
tion for his literary ability."
