# Gandhi Great Man of Century, Smith Tells Socialist Caucus
## 
### SONYA MICHEL 
"Gandhi is one of the great men
of our century, important for the
whole world, as well as India,"
Prof. Jeffrey Smith told a Social
ist Caucus meeting last night at
the I-Center.
Although he is known for his
activities in the Indian movement
toward nationalism, Gandhi's
spiritual power is more signifi
cant. Smith fell. "His orientation
was social and human rather than
economic and politics was inci
dental to this."
SMITH pointed out two of
Gandhi's characteristics which he
thought made him an "extraordi
nary" figure: his abilities to com
bine politics with spirituality, and
to fuse Eastern and Western
ideas.
"Gandhi has been described as
a saint trying to be a politician."
Smith noted. But Gandhi said of
himself. "I am a politician trying
to be a saint."
Smith explained that Gandhi's
ideology was Western in char
acter. It drew upon Western lib

eralism, democratic ideas, and a
high regard for the civil rights of
the individual.
"BUT," Smith said, "he goes be
yond liberalism in his outlook on
life and humanity. He combines
certain aspects of the ethical side
of Christianity with the traditions
of India and Hinduism."
"Gandhi was a man of great
sensitivity, compassion, and feel
ing for his fellow men. At the
same time, he was a man of great
strength."
Noting the wide knowledge and
control of the physical world man
has today, Smith said: "More than
any 20th century figure, Gandhi
demonstrates the kind of deep,
inward energy, latent in all of
us. that is necessary to cope with
the forces of destruction all
around us.
"He was not a man to ask peo
ple to accept him without ques
tioning. or to make a cult of him
self. He demonstrated the powers
of non-violence and love, the ideal
conditions under which ho
thought man should live."
