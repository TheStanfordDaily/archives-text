# Georgia Campus Tense as Negroes Return to Classes
## State Troopers Maintain Vigil 
### 
ATHENS, Ga. (UPI) Two
Negro students whose presence
on the University of Georgia cam
pus sparked a riot last week re
turned to classes yesterday under
police escort and were given a
tense, silent reception.
Last night state troopers and
plain clothesmen kept a tight
watch over the quiet campus to
guard against any sudden out
break of hostilities.
Focal point of the security
watch was Center Myers Hall,
the dormitory housing Negro
coed Charlayne Hunter, where
student demonstrations last week
led to the suspension of the two
Negro students.
EARLIER in the day, Char
layne Hunter, 18. and Hamilton
Holmes, 19, their faces reflecting
the uneasiness of the situation,
stepped from cars that brought
them to the campus.
But they and their fellow stu
dents loosened up as the day
progressed.
A coed who passed Miss Hunter
on the sidewalk helped break the
spell.
"HI, CHARLAYNE," she said.
The Negro girl nodded and man
aged her first smile of the day.
Unlike last week when there
were scattered jeers and shouts of
"We don't want you here, nigger."
there was not. the faintest hint of
a demonstration today. Students
had been warned that an outburst
of any kind could result in sus
pension or expulsion.
Miss Hunter was accompanied
to her first class, a psychology
lecture, by Dean of Students
Joseph Williams. Hunter reported
first to a zoology class on the
first floor of the Science Building.
A FEW SMALL groups gath
ered along the sidewalks to stare
at the Negroes, but most students
paid no particular attention to
their presence.
Other students, their heads
down, walked by the Negroes
seemingly without noticing them
and continued on to their classes.
Still others would turn and look
I back at the Negroes after they
! had passed.
A number of student groups
paved the way for the calm ac
ceptance by circulating pamphlets
urging students to exercise the
"Golden Rule" in greeting the
Negroes.
ALTHOUGH integration of the 1
1175-year-old school seemed to be
proceeding without a hitch, uni
versity officials, mindful of the
sequence of events last: week,
were taking no chances and kept
Georgia Bureau of Investigation
detectives with the students.
Last week's outburst did not
come until after classes had con
cluded for the day and the cam
pus was teeming with students
who turned out for a basketball
game between the university and
arch-rival Georgia Tech.
The Negro coed seemed amused
by the photographers who raced
ahead of her snapping pictures as
she walked across campus en
route to the History Building.

Last week's outburst did not
come until after classes had con
cluded for the day and the cam
pus was teeming with students
who turned out for a basketball
game between the university and
arch-rival Georgia Tech.
The Negro coed seemed amused
by the photographers who raced
ahead of her snapping pictures as
she walked across campus en
route to the History Building.
ATHENS, Ga. (UPI) Two
Negro students whose presence
on the University of Georgia cam
pus sparked a riot last week re
turned to classes yesterday under
police escort and were given a
tense, silent reception.
Last night state troopers and
plain clothesmen kept a tight
watch over the quiet campus to
guard against any sudden out
break of hostilities.
Focal point of the security
watch was Center Myers Hall,
the dormitory housing Negro
coed Charlayne Hunter, where
student demonstrations last week
led to the suspension of the two
Negro students.
EARLIER in the day, Char
layne Hunter, 18. and Hamilton
Holmes, 19, their faces reflecting
the uneasiness of the situation,
stepped from cars that brought
them to the campus.
But they and their fellow stu
dents loosened up as the day
progressed.
A coed who passed Miss Hunter
on the sidewalk helped break the
spell.
"HI, CHARLAYNE," she said.
The Negro girl nodded and man
aged her first smile of the day.
Unlike last week when there
were scattered jeers and shouts of
"We don't want you here, nigger."
there was not. the faintest hint of
a demonstration today. Students
had been warned that an outburst
of any kind could result in sus
pension or expulsion.
Miss Hunter was accompanied
to her first class, a psychology
lecture, by Dean of Students
Joseph Williams. Hunter reported
first to a zoology class on the
first floor of the Science Building.
A FEW SMALL groups gath
ered along the sidewalks to stare
at the Negroes, but most students
paid no particular attention to
their presence.
Other students, their heads
down, walked by the Negroes
seemingly without noticing them
and continued on to their classes.
Still others would turn and look
I back at the Negroes after they
! had passed.
A number of student groups
paved the way for the calm ac
ceptance by circulating pamphlets
urging students to exercise the
"Golden Rule" in greeting the
Negroes.
ALTHOUGH integration of the 1
1175-year-old school seemed to be
proceeding without a hitch, uni
versity officials, mindful of the
sequence of events last: week,
were taking no chances and kept
Georgia Bureau of Investigation
detectives with the students.
