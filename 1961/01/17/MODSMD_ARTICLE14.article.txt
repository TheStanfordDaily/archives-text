The referendum on Algeria is,
it seems to me, more decisive than
the gross figures seem to show.
Thus, it is true that if we count
the abstainers as having voted no,
then Gen. De Gaulle received 56
per cent of the vote in France it
self and only 39 per cent in Al
geria. But these figures do not
tell correctly the story of what
happened.
What was the issue on which all
these votes were cast? It was
whether Gen. De Gaulle should
have a mandate to make an Alger
ian settlement on the basis, if
necessary, of independence for Al
geria. On this issue FYance itself
voted overwhelmingly to give De
Gaulle a mandate to make an
Algerian peace. Only about 18
per cent of the registered voters
sought to deny him the mandate.
But who were they? They were
the Rightists who want to retain
Algeria as a part of France and
they were the Communists who,
while they do not care about Al
geria, are opposed for other rea
sons to De Gaulle.
Most of the no n-voters, more
over, are to be counted as silent
assenters to De Gaulle's policies,
for in France the politically pas
sive are, for the most part, willing
to go along with his leadership.
We may conclude that France
itself, metropolitan France, has
now said decisively that it wants
peace, that it does not support
any longer the resistance of the
Europeans in Algeria, and that,
while it hopes for an association
with Algeria, it is prepared to
accept an independent Algeria.
This is a decisive result.
The voting in Algeria itself was
much less significant. The Euro
peans voted no, as of course they
would. The Moslems abstained in
the cities, following the instruc
tions of the rebel leaders, and in
the country they voted when the
French Army took them to the
polls. One cannot take these votes |
seriously. What the voting does !
show is that the Europeans are a
small minority, no longer sup
ported politically by their com
patriots in France, and that the
Moslems will follow the leaders
of the rebellion.
The practical conclusions to be
drawn from all this are, it seems

, to me, these. First, an Algerian
i peace will have to be negotiated
. with the Algerians who have
waged the war. It cannot be nego
, tiated with anyone else.
I Second, the European minority,
• which is to lose its political priv
■ ileges, will now be in jeopardy of
losing everything under the pres
sure of the huge Moslem major
ity. In withdrawing their support
of the European settlers, the peo
; pie of metropolitan France have
assumed the obligation of protect
ing the lives of the settlers and
of idemnifying them for the pos
sible loss of their property. This
is, I understand, thoroughly un
derstood at the highest levels in
France, and may carry with it an
offer to repatriate to metropoli
tan France those who wish to
leave a Moslem Algeria.
By this referendum Gen. De
Gaulle has won a vote of confi
dence in himself, he has won a
mandate to proceed to the surgi
cal operation which peace almost
certainly requires, and he has re
ceived notice that the people of
France want to finish with the
Algerian business. No one who
looks at this vote can imaging the
French people supporting an Al-!
gerian civil war for years to come.,
There can be no double that,
American opinion will be strongly
in favor of Gen. De Gaulle, and
whatever influence we have in j
North Africa, in the United Na-;
tions, in other world capitals, is
sure to be exerted to help him.
He must succeed. For there is
no tolerable alternative. Were he
to fail, the Algerian war would
become terrible in its desperation,
almost certainly it would become,
at least by proxy, an international
war. In that event France would
be sucked out of any genuine al
! liance with the West and the
whole structure of the Western
system would be shaken.
If we are entering a period of
quiet diplomacy, we should make
; it quite clear that a convulsion
jin Western Europe and in the
Western Mediterranean would
make the international situation
unmanageable. Therefore, those
who want to relax the tensions
will find it important to keep
them relaxed in North Africa.
