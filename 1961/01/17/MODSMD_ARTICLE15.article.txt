## Emotion's Not Enough 
### 
The night after the discussion
on the House Committee on Un-
American Activities, someone
walked into our room and began
to talk about the HCUA. While
saying that personally he was
pretty much in favor of the com
mittee, the person complained
that only men like Karl Prussion
and Wilhelm Schmitt could be
found to argue in favor of the
HCUA.
He seemed to think that there
are reasonably objective, honest
and capable men who are willing
to speak for the HCUA, and to
present arguments formed out of
thought and facts, rather than
out of pure emotion, as Prussion
and Schmitt did. Our answer was
that we have yet to see an adult
who will lay aside the standard
references to God, Flag, and so
on, and offer us concrete reasons
why the HCUA should be con
tinued.
Instead, all we hear is that the
HCUA is fighting Communism
and its "Godless apologists" in the
U.S. They proceed from there, as
Schmitt did, into arguments
which seem to center about the
fact that Communism is anti-re
ligion and therefore had, and that
the danger of Communism is so
intense in this country that Com
munists deserve no protection or
mercy.
They almost always refuse to
discuss such matters as the dis
torted film "Operation Abolition,"
the constitutionality of the HCUA
or the question of whether even
anti-democratic elements in this
democratic society deserve the
complete protection of the Con
stitution.
We, and many others—includ
ing those who favor the HCUA—

were extremely disappointed that
such matters weren't debated by
Mr. Prussion and Mr. Schmitt
when their opponents b r o u g h t
them out Wednesday night.
Prussion, Schmitt and company
are content to mouth phrases urg
ing one and all to fight Commu
nism "wherever there is a menace
to the American Way of Life," to
"JOIN NOW. FIGHT RED FAS
CISM." and on, and on and on.
Why do they insult our intelli
gence by refusing to debate the
facts, as they so obviously did for
an hour and 20 minutes in Cub
berley Wednesday?
The debate is not about God or
the American way of life; it is
on the HCUA and whether it
should be continued, revised or
disbanded.
We would hope that proponents
of the committee would stick to
the subject but from watching
Reps. Willis and Walter, and men
such as Prussion and Schmitt, at
work first hand, we are convinced
that this will not happen, and
also that the personnel on the
committee will continue to be
made up of Willises, Walters and
the like—certainly not the best
men the House of Representatives
has to offer.
Thus we have two of our many
objections to the HCUA ami its
supporters whi c h Wednesday
night's film and panel brought
out: the men on the committee
are mainly interested in publicity
for themselves and smearing the
lives of those they summon before
them; and the HCUA mpfnbers
and friends will not engage* in a
debate on specifies such as dis
torted films, is the committee vio
lating the Constitution, and so
forth.
