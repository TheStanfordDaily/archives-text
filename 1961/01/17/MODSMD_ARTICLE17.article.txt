Editor, the Daily:
The last two weeks of the term,
I was confronted suddenly with
a problem most vexing under the
very best of circumstances; viz.,
finding a place to live. As a grad
uate student living off campus,
I dreaded the ordeal of looking
for suitable housing I could af
ford.
Studying for final exams and
writing term papers left no time
to do the usual scouting, and
friends weren't offering any good
suggestions. I avoided consulting
(he list in the housing office as
long as possible, for I knew well
what I would find.
A few entries with embarras
sing comments like "Foreign stu
dents welcomed" would indicate
that one would not be denied the
chance to consider the place just
because he is a student from
Africa or Asia.
This statement, however, does
not apply to AMERICAN stu
dents of Afro-Asian ancestry. On
previous occasions, several stu
dents had told me that most land
lords refused to rent to Negroes;
that the Stanford housing office
saw no reason to issue a policy
foi'bidding a landlord practicing
discrimination based on race,
color, or religion against any of
its students to register with its
office because there are only a
few Negro students attending
school here; that agreements
made by telephone were broken
when the student showed up in
person, and that such outrageous
demands sometimes were made,
if the landlord did accept the stu
dent, like three-months' rent in
advance or signing a Ihree-year
lease.
But since I had not undergone
such experiences myself and since
by the end of the term my plight
had become quite desperate, I re
luctantly decided to consult the
housing list and take my chances.
Mustering up my courage and
taking a deep breath. I went to
the office, jotted down likely pos
sibilities, and looked for the near
est telephone. (I didn't have the
nerve to face the insults in per
son. )
Repeatedly, I was told that Ihe
apartment in question was nol
for rent to Negroes. The nausea,
blind fury and utter helplessness
I felt are quite indescribable. Re
flecting afterwards over the situ
ation, I wondered to myself why
Stanford could condone and per
petuate such a vicious and un
ethical practice against any of its
students.
Do my rights as a student di

i minish because I happen 1o bo,
numbered among the few?
Though it is quite true that Stan
ford has no jurisdiction over tho i
| renters and their property, does
she not have a moral influence
in (he community by making it
clear that ihe university will not
tolerate such discrimination?
Finally, is it not somewhat in- j
consistent to inaugurate on the
| one hand, ihe commendable pro-1
| gram on the affairs of far-off j
; Africa and to neglect, on the other j
! hand, such a problem right here
I on campus?
Maybe I am asking too much
I of a "112 i r s t - r a t e institution of ;
1 higher learning," a phrase often
used to describe Stanford and its!
| program. Or maybe I am just |
| prejudiced against prejudiced j
I landlords.

It is truly unlikely that Iho in

martyred themselves in the San

been duped into mob violence by
Communist agitators.
The paint is hardly dry on my 1

me about the unfortunate Uni

unknowing dupes of the KKK and j
the White supremacists; pawns in
a dirty game of riots and mob i

Well, what the heck! CAN col-!

that Georgia University students

The last two weeks of the term,
I was confronted suddenly with
a problem most vexing under the
very best of circumstances; viz.,
finding a place to live. As a grad
uate student living off campus,
I dreaded the ordeal of looking
for suitable housing I could af
ford.
Studying for final exams and
writing term papers left no time
to do the usual scouting, and
friends weren't offering any good
suggestions. I avoided consulting
(he list in the housing office as
long as possible, for I knew well
what I would find.
A few entries with embarras
sing comments like "Foreign stu
dents welcomed" would indicate
that one would not be denied the
chance to consider the place just
because he is a student from
Africa or Asia.
This statement, however, does
not apply to AMERICAN stu
dents of Afro-Asian ancestry. On
previous occasions, several stu
dents had told me that most land
lords refused to rent to Negroes;
that the Stanford housing office
saw no reason to issue a policy
foi'bidding a landlord practicing
discrimination based on race,
color, or religion against any of
its students to register with its
office because there are only a
few Negro students attending
school here; that agreements
made by telephone were broken
when the student showed up in
person, and that such outrageous
demands sometimes were made,
if the landlord did accept the stu
dent, like three-months' rent in
advance or signing a Ihree-year
lease.
But since I had not undergone
such experiences myself and since
by the end of the term my plight
had become quite desperate, I re
luctantly decided to consult the
housing list and take my chances.
Mustering up my courage and
taking a deep breath. I went to
the office, jotted down likely pos
sibilities, and looked for the near
est telephone. (I didn't have the
nerve to face the insults in per
son. )
Repeatedly, I was told that Ihe
apartment in question was nol
for rent to Negroes. The nausea,
blind fury and utter helplessness
I felt are quite indescribable. Re
flecting afterwards over the situ
ation, I wondered to myself why
Stanford could condone and per
petuate such a vicious and un
ethical practice against any of its
students.
Do my rights as a student di

i minish because I happen 1o bo,
numbered among the few?
Though it is quite true that Stan
ford has no jurisdiction over tho i
| renters and their property, does
she not have a moral influence
in (he community by making it
clear that ihe university will not
tolerate such discrimination?
Finally, is it not somewhat in- j
consistent to inaugurate on the
| one hand, ihe commendable pro-1
| gram on the affairs of far-off j
; Africa and to neglect, on the other j
! hand, such a problem right here
I on campus?
Maybe I am asking too much
I of a "112 i r s t - r a t e institution of ;

used to describe Stanford and its!
| program. Or maybe I am just |
| prejudiced against prejudiced j

The last two weeks of the term,
I was confronted suddenly with
a problem most vexing under the
very best of circumstances; viz.,
finding a place to live. As a grad
uate student living off campus,
I dreaded the ordeal of looking
for suitable housing I could af
ford.
Studying for final exams and
writing term papers left no time
to do the usual scouting, and
friends weren't offering any good
suggestions. I avoided consulting
(he list in the housing office as
long as possible, for I knew well
what I would find.
A few entries with embarras
sing comments like "Foreign stu
dents welcomed" would indicate
that one would not be denied the
chance to consider the place just
because he is a student from
Africa or Asia.
This statement, however, does
not apply to AMERICAN stu
dents of Afro-Asian ancestry. On
previous occasions, several stu
dents had told me that most land
lords refused to rent to Negroes;
that the Stanford housing office
saw no reason to issue a policy
foi'bidding a landlord practicing
discrimination based on race,
color, or religion against any of
its students to register with its
office because there are only a
few Negro students attending
school here; that agreements
made by telephone were broken
when the student showed up in
person, and that such outrageous
demands sometimes were made,
if the landlord did accept the stu
dent, like three-months' rent in
advance or signing a Ihree-year
lease.
But since I had not undergone
such experiences myself and since
by the end of the term my plight
had become quite desperate, I re
luctantly decided to consult the
housing list and take my chances.
Mustering up my courage and
taking a deep breath. I went to
the office, jotted down likely pos
sibilities, and looked for the near
est telephone. (I didn't have the
nerve to face the insults in per
son. )
Repeatedly, I was told that Ihe
apartment in question was nol
for rent to Negroes. The nausea,
blind fury and utter helplessness
I felt are quite indescribable. Re
flecting afterwards over the situ
ation, I wondered to myself why
Stanford could condone and per
petuate such a vicious and un
ethical practice against any of its
students.
Do my rights as a student di

i minish because I happen 1o bo,
numbered among the few?
Though it is quite true that Stan
ford has no jurisdiction over tho i
| renters and their property, does
she not have a moral influence
in (he community by making it
clear that ihe university will not
tolerate such discrimination?
Finally, is it not somewhat in- j
consistent to inaugurate on the

lords refused to rent to Negroes;
that the Stanford housing office
saw no reason to issue a policy
foi'bidding a landlord practicing
discrimination based on race,
color, or religion against any of
its students to register with its
office because there are only a
few Negro students attending
school here; that agreements
made by telephone were broken
when the student showed up in
person, and that such outrageous
demands sometimes were made,
if the landlord did accept the stu
dent, like three-months' rent in
advance or signing a Ihree-year
lease.
But since I had not undergone
such experiences myself and since
by the end of the term my plight
had become quite desperate, I re
luctantly decided to consult the
housing list and take my chances.
Mustering up my courage and
taking a deep breath. I went to
the office, jotted down likely pos
sibilities, and looked for the near
est telephone. (I didn't have the
nerve to face the insults in per
son. )
Repeatedly, I was told that Ihe
apartment in question was nol
for rent to Negroes. The nausea,
blind fury and utter helplessness
I felt are quite indescribable. Re
flecting afterwards over the situ
ation, I wondered to myself why
Stanford could condone and per
petuate such a vicious and un
ethical practice against any of its
students.
Do my rights as a student di

I do not deny (hat students dem

the HCUA were not demonstrat

that Georgia University students

The last two weeks of the term,
I was confronted suddenly with
a problem most vexing under the
very best of circumstances; viz.,
finding a place to live. As a grad
uate student living off campus,
I dreaded the ordeal of looking
for suitable housing I could af
ford.
Studying for final exams and
writing term papers left no time
to do the usual scouting, and
friends weren't offering any good
suggestions. I avoided consulting
(he list in the housing office as
long as possible, for I knew well
what I would find.
A few entries with embarras
sing comments like "Foreign stu
dents welcomed" would indicate
that one would not be denied the
chance to consider the place just
because he is a student from
Africa or Asia.
This statement, however, does
not apply to AMERICAN stu
dents of Afro-Asian ancestry. On
previous occasions, several stu
dents had told me that most land
lords refused to rent to Negroes;
that the Stanford housing office
saw no reason to issue a policy
foi'bidding a landlord practicing
discrimination based on race,
color, or religion against any of
its students to register with its
office because there are only a
few Negro students attending
school here; that agreements
made by telephone were broken
when the student showed up in

demands sometimes were made,

dent, like three-months' rent in
