I j
Letters to the Editor should not ,
exceed 250 words. Name, address
and phone number should be in
eluded. Typewritten letters have
a better chance of appearing. Let- i
ters shall be printed without
change except in the case of po
tentially libelous material. The:
fact that any letters hold an op
posite viewpoint from the Edi
torial Board will not matter.
