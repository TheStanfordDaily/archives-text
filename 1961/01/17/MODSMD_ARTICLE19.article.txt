# Soviet Experts Predict Return to Marxist Idea
## 
### 
NEW YORK tUPI) — Soviet
affairs experts here predict that
the Soviet Union will soon haul
out the old Marxist idea of "with
ering away of the stale" for use
in a new propaganda drive.
Withering away of the state has
long been an important part of
Communist theory. As outlined
by Marx and Engels, it means
that once communism is solidly
established in a nation, there will
be no further need for police,
courts, an army, or any other in
struments of compulsion.
These theorists reasoned that
in a perfect Communist society,
where there would be abundance
for all, there would be no need
for police to catch thieves or
courts to try them because no one
would have to steal. Citizens
would be so thoroughly trained in
their Communist duties that they
would need no one to tell them
what to do or punish them.
The completely withered-away
state would have only administra
tors, which could be ordinary
citizens taking turns at the job.
It is obvious lhat Soviet leaders,
with the largest and most effi
cient secret police force in the
world to keep them in power, have
not taken this theory very .seri
ously so far. They have no illu
sions about what would happen
to them if the powerful organs of
state control and repression were
"withered away."
But the experts here, some of
whom have recently returned
from Russia, see growing signs
that more is being planned in the
direction of replacing state power
with popular bodies.
The two main forms this far are
vigilante groups of Communists,
replacing the police in some in
stances, and "Comrades' Courts,"
supplementing the regular court
system for minor offenses.
The experts caution, however,
that there are, as always, strict
safeguards built in to the new
systems to make sure that no
real control over the Soviet peo
ple is surrendered.
The chief of these is the con
tinued presence and direction of
the Communist Party in the Vigi
lantes and Comrades' Courts. In
addition, there is the fact that
little actual power is being given
up.
Why does a police state find it
necessary to surrender any of its
prerogatives at all? One reason
is the Communist campaign to in
f 1 u en c e newly-independent na
tions.
Another reason is public opin

ion at home. The Soviet leaders
want to allow their citizens to
feel they have a say in running'
tilings, even if they do not. Their
elaborate provisions for "Demo
eratie" government are examples
of this. As an added dividend, tin*
new courts and vigilantes take
away bothersome minor offenses
from tin* police blotters and court
dockets.

Why does a police state find it
necessary to surrender any of its
prerogatives at all? One reason
is the Communist campaign to in
f 1 u en c e newly-independent na
tions.
Another reason is public opin

ion at home. The Soviet leaders
want to allow their citizens to
feel they have a say in running'
tilings, even if they do not. Their
elaborate provisions for "Demo
eratie" government are examples
of this. As an added dividend, tin*
new courts and vigilantes take
away bothersome minor offenses
from tin* police blotters and court
dockets.
NEW YORK tUPI) — Soviet
affairs experts here predict that
the Soviet Union will soon haul
out the old Marxist idea of "with
ering away of the stale" for use
in a new propaganda drive.
Withering away of the state has
long been an important part of
Communist theory. As outlined
by Marx and Engels, it means
that once communism is solidly
established in a nation, there will
be no further need for police,
courts, an army, or any other in
struments of compulsion.
These theorists reasoned that
in a perfect Communist society,
where there would be abundance
for all, there would be no need
for police to catch thieves or
courts to try them because no one
would have to steal. Citizens
would be so thoroughly trained in
their Communist duties that they
would need no one to tell them
what to do or punish them.
The completely withered-away
state would have only administra
tors, which could be ordinary
citizens taking turns at the job.
It is obvious lhat Soviet leaders,
with the largest and most effi
cient secret police force in the
world to keep them in power, have
not taken this theory very .seri
ously so far. They have no illu
sions about what would happen
to them if the powerful organs of
state control and repression were
"withered away."
But the experts here, some of
whom have recently returned
from Russia, see growing signs
that more is being planned in the
direction of replacing state power
with popular bodies.
The two main forms this far are
vigilante groups of Communists,
replacing the police in some in
stances, and "Comrades' Courts,"
supplementing the regular court
system for minor offenses.
The experts caution, however,
that there are, as always, strict
safeguards built in to the new
systems to make sure that no
real control over the Soviet peo
ple is surrendered.
The chief of these is the con
tinued presence and direction of
the Communist Party in the Vigi
lantes and Comrades' Courts. In
addition, there is the fact that
little actual power is being given
up.
