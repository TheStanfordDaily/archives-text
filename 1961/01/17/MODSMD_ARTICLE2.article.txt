# Funds for Project 'M' Requested of Congress
## 
### 
Expenditure of over §100 million for Stanford's proposed two
mile-long linear accelerator—Project 'M' was asked of Congress yes
terday by President Eisenhower.
The Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy is ex
pected to hold hearings on the subject the early part of this year,

THE PROJECT has been fa- j
vored virtually unanimously by
the country's top scientists and
it has been recommended that it !
be given top priority after exist-1
ing projects.
Last September the government j
appropriated $3 million for design
and development but withheld ap
proval of the project. The Com
mittee on Atomic Energy has!
never presented the project in J
total to Congress.
Most of the $3 million appropri
ated will be spent under the direc
tion of Stanford for components, i
while $300,000 will be -.spent on
initial construction and sidework. I
THREE FIRMS John A. Blum
Associate of San Francisco, Ace- j
tron. Division of Aerojet-General
Corporation in Covina and Guy
F. Atkins & Company of South
San Francisco have recently
been appointed by the University
for architect - engineer - manage-1
ment services.
The multi-billion volt linear ac
celerator was first proposed to i
the government in 1957. Hearings j
on the project were held by the.
Joint Congressional Committee on j
Atomic Energy in 1959 and 1960. |
Initially the accelerator would
have a capacity of 10-20 billion
electron volts, but the design will s
provide for eventually increasing
the power to 45 billion volts,
which would make it: the most |
powerful accelerator in the world. 1
