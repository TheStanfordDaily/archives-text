THE KM) OF AN era. That is the only way one can describe what
has happened at the University of California. National basketball
champions in 1959 and runnerup last year — ihe Bears have seen
their glorious days and now must pay the price that eventually ac
crues to all champions: they must accept defeat from rivals that
they could have virtually demolished in the era just past.
When guard Paul Neumann and his Stanford teammates throt
tled Cal's vaunted pressing defense in the tiny Stanford Pavilion
midway through the 1959 season who would have believed that Coach
Pete Newell's boys would go undefeated the rest of the way and
turn back the best teams in the country for the national champion
ship. But that is just what happened and there were many Stanford
fans who later took great pride in that victory over the Golden Bears.

Little did they know how long the
taste of that one victory would
have to be savored.
PKTK NKWKIiL did something
more than merely coach his team.
He parlayed a defense-first trump
card to heights reminiscent of the
heyday of Bill Russell and K. C.
Jones at the University of San
Francisco: when the Dons made
monkeys out of all comers with
their crushing defensive hustle
and just a d equate scoring
strength.
The University of California be
came something of a legend late
in the '50's. When they took the
floor they gave the feeling of
being prepared and they made
few mistakes to shatter that il
lusion. At home the Golden Bears
were unbeatable. Backed by ca
pacity crowds at every game and
a small but snappy straw-hat

hand, basketball at Cal became a way of life. To play on the team at
all was a thrill and the players never gave up until the referee re
fused to look any more.
Perhaps the end of the era started when Newell retired at
the end of last season to become athletic director. Perhaps it was
when All-America center Darrall Imhoff graduated last June.
Straw Hatters Left Out
Maybe it oven happened when Newell learned that the straw-hat
band was not allowed to play at this year's Los Angeles Invitational
Tournament. The reason was that the tournament directors did not
want any team to have an unfair advantage. Newell screamed bloody
murder but the rule stood. The straw-hat band limped down to LA,
but this time just as spectators. When the athletic department came
out with the statement that this would beCal's last year at the tourna
ment if the band was not allowed to play — still nothing was done.
The change was complete. The straw-hatters had climbed the pin
nacle, had tasted the highest success possible and now were on the
way down.
.WHILE THE BANI) situation illuminates what happened to those
close to the action, only the record book can show what happened
to I he team. California began the season in its own typically unim
pressive form squeaking out victories in low-scoring contests with
the Alumni and "sister school" Santa Barbara. Then rookie Coach
Rene Herrerias saw his quintet, improving as expected, best San
Jose State, St. Mary's, University of San Francisco and Northwestern.
It seemed like the same old story.
Then it happened. St. Louis upset the Rears at Lexington in the
Kentucky Classic's opening round. All was not tragedy, however,
for St. Louis was an outstanding team and the Berkeley squads
never really achieved their greatness until the season had taken
shape.
One weekend later though Cal had lost again—this time to lowa
in the Los Angeles Invitational- and the experts were quickly tiring
of looking at past records. The Bears did make a slight comeback
by winning a couple of consolation games and there was still hope
for there had been no league contests as yet.
The Rest of the League Arises
The University of Southern California came to Harmon Gym for
Friday and Saturday night games the first week of the new year.
The papers still predicted Cal to toughen up in the opening of league
play, and were really rocked when the visiting Trojans ended the
Bears' home winning streak in reckless fashion. Cal made all sorts
of errors in the opening stages and never could make it all the way
back. When USC turned the trick again the next night there were
those who still gave the Bears a chance to come back, but they knew
that it was now or never.
WHEN' STANFORD'S Indians the next week invaded legendary
jinxed Harmon Gym and outlasted the hosts even Oskie gave up
and started thinking about football.
The era was over. Cal was finished in this year's His; Five Con
ference battle. It must be an eerie feeling experienced by captain
Kill Met lintock and guard Karl Shultz —the lasf remaining- lettermen
of the 1959 national championship team —as they glance over their
shoulders and remember the stretch through 1959 and '60 when Cal
won 2n straight, lost one. and then won 19 more in a row.
