# Pender Is Looking for Big Money

### 
BOSTON (UPI) — Co-middle
weight champion Paul Pender is
looking forward to "some big
money" in 1961 a couple of hun
dred thousand dollars or so—as
he summed up his spectacular
title defense of Saturday night.
"1 WANT money fights." he
said, relaxing at his suburban
Brookline home. "I made about
$51,000 Saturday night, beating
Terry Dowries, hut I want more
big-money fights."
The 30-year-old former fireman
used a stinging left jab and hook
like an ax as he cut the British
challenger's face to a bloody mess.
Referee Billy Connelly halted the
bout after 57 seconds of the sev
enth round with a one and one
half slice to the bone showing
1 down Downes' nose.
KI.OOD spurting from the
wound was impairing Terry's vi
sion. As somebody in Pender's
dressing room put it later: Paul
would have knocked his nose off
his face if they didn't stop it."
"I fought the last four rounds
with impaired vision, too," Pen
der disclosed. "Downes landed a
| solid left in the third and after
that I had to cock my head a lot
to see him."
PENDER said he wants to meet
the winner of the Gene Fullmer-
Sugar Ray Robinson bout next
month "to settle this World-NBA
championship thing." But he
added he'd like to take on Carmen
Basilio in a title defense while
| waiting for a shot at either Full
mer or Robinson.
The National Boxing Associa
tion recognizes Fullmer as its
champion. Pender is regarded as
champ in Massachusetts, New
York, and Europe. Pender now
has successfully defended his
crown twice, once against Sugar
Ray.
