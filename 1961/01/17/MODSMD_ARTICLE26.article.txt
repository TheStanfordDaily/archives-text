## 
### 
BRUSSELS (UPIt Gendarmes fired yesterday on hundreds of
Soeialist-lecl strikers who attacked a street car in a suburb of the
industrial city of Liege.
At least two demonstrators were reported wounded by the volley.
One of the casualties- former Belgian middleweight boxing champion

Joseph Wousdem was reported
in serious condition with a bullet
wound in the head.
King Baudouin was informed
of the Liege shooting by Deputy
Premier Rene Lefebvre. The So
cialist Executive Committee or
dered Socialist deputies to bring
up the issue "urgently" in Parlia
ment.
IX BRUSSELS, some 3,000 So
cialist sympathizers marched
through downtown streets behind
red flags and a band playing the
"Internationale." Some 6,000 de
fiant strikers also staged an anti
government demonstration in
Charleroi.
The new rioting broke out amid
claims by Belgium's Catholic-
Liberal government that there
was a large-scale back-to-work
movement by workers who have
been striking for nearly a month
in protest against proposed aus
terity measures.
The government said the situa
tion was back to normal in seven
out of Belgium's nine provinces.
BUT THE Socialists said the
walkout in their south Belgium
strongholds continued near-total.
Their party and trade union lead
ers vowed they would keep heavy
industries idle "for months if
necessary."
The street fighting began in
Liege after some 500 die-hard
strikers attacked and smashed a
street car in suburban Chenee.
The strikers had come from a
mass meeting that had voted to
continue the walkout in the Liege
district, a holdout strike area in
the northern Flemish section of
the country where the govern
ment position is strong.
Shortly before the riot, the
demonstrators had heard Socialist
strike leader Andre Renard com
plain bitterly over the failure of
north Belgian Flemish workers to
continue the anti-government
movement.
