# WILLING TO NEGOTIATE
## Algerian Rebels Ready 
### 
PARIS (UPl)—The Algerian
Moslem rebel regime announced
yesterday it is ready to open ne
gotiations with the French toward
a peaceful settlement of the Alge
rian war. Informed French
sources said President Charles De
Gaulle might agree to such talks.
The rebel "provisional govern
ment" announced its offer in Tu
nis at the end of a week-long
meeting held to consider the re
sults of the referendum in which
Do Gaulle won solid endorsement
for his "Algerian Algeria" policy.
THE REBEL leaders said they
were prepared to negotiate with
the French government on condi
tions for a new referendum in
which the Algerian people would
decide their own future. In such
a vote they could choose between
complete independence, or semi
independence and continued close
links with Franc.
"The Algerian problem lias en
tered a new phase which opens up
the possibility of a peaceful, nego
tiated settlement," the rebel gov
ernment statement said.
The rebels, in their negotiation
offer, posed two conditions:
• THE FUTURE referendum
vote must be "free." This presum
ably meant that the French would
have to withdraw their 400,000-
man army from Algeria before
the vote. De Gaulle has insisted
the army must remain in Algeria
to guarantee a free vote.
• De Gaulle must abandon his
plans for setting up a new provi
sional administration in Algeria
before such a referendum. The
rebels said such a provisional set
up would be one "handed out to
and imposed upon" the Algerians.
It warned that if De Gaulle per
sists with this plan the six-year
old war in Algeria will continue.
De Gaulle was conferring with
Premier Michel Debre when the

j rebel statement was made public.
Jean Morin, Do Gaulle's Delegate
General for Algeria, flew to Paris
yesterday morning lor a meeting
of the Algerian Affairs Commit
tee. Gen Jean Crepin, French
Commander-in-Chief in North Af
, rica, also was expected to fly here.
THERE WAS no immediate of
ficial French reaction to the rebel
move.
Privately, French sources ex
pressed gratification at tlie rebel
offer to negotiate. They predicted
that Do Gaulle himself probably
would make the next move soon
in a secret peace approach to the
Algerian rebel leaders.
These sources said, however,
they did not expect agreement to
come easily. They thought it un
likely that De Gaulle could accept
! the two main conditions laid down
j by the rebels.
THE FRENCH sources pointed
out that De Gaulle has promised
repeatedly that France would not
abandon the more than one mil
i lion Europeans in Algeria or the
i hundreds of thousands among ihe
: Moslem population of nine million
1 who have thrown in their lot with
I France.
