# Ike Submits Budget of 80.9 Billion
## 
### 
WASHINGTON ( UPI) Presi- i
dent Eisenhower yesterday sub- j
mitted a record peacetime spend-'
ing budget of $80.9 billion and!
warned the incoming Kennedy l
Administration against upsetting |
its delicate paper balance through '
"credit card" financing.
The President's final budget
message to Congress envisioned a
SI .."5 billion surplus in the 12
months starting July 1, but made
it contingent on an increase in
postal rates, a boost in gasoline
taxes and a pickup in business.
RISEN lIOWKH, who refused to
call the current economic situa
tion a recession, seemed to have
little doubt about business. He
said the economy crossed the half
trillion dollar mark last year for
the first time and "further sub
stantial increases" are in sight in
1961.
He added, however, that grow-j
ing national security needs—de
fense, foreign aid and space ex
ploration—plus desirable domestic
programs such as medical care j
for the aged and federal school!
aid rule out any general tax relief
in the foreseeable future.
While underscoring his aim of {
"peace with justice," Eisenhower [
proposed a $1.4 billion step-up in I
defense spending to a record !
peacetime total of $42.9 billion, j
He .said much of the money would |
go for missile-age weapons and 1
would "keep our military the I
strongest in the world."
THE P R E S I I) E N T likewise I
callcd for a $250 million increase i
in foreign aid, raising the totali
to $3.6 billion. This would permit j
greater U.S. emphasis on pro
grams for restless Africa and in |
Latin America, where Castroism
still appeals to many.
Eisenhower sougnt $965 million ;
for civilian space projects, a hike i
of $195 million, in hopes of put ]
ting a man in orbit this year. He
earmarked $584 million of the de
fense figure for "military astro
nautics" such as spy-in-the-sky
and communications satellites.
Eisenhower conceded that Pres
ident-elect John F. Kenendy can
revise the requests as he sees fit
after he is sworn in next Friday. •
But he added in an apparent ref-i
erence to Democratic campaign
pledges that the nation cannot af
ford everything "being urged by
special groups."
"This budget,"he said, "reflects i
the conviction that military
strength and domestic advance
ment must be based on a sound
economy, and that fiscal integrity
is essential to the responsible con
duct of government affairs."

WASHINGTON ( UPI) Presi- i
dent Eisenhower yesterday sub- j
mitted a record peacetime spend-'
ing budget of $80.9 billion and!
warned the incoming Kennedy l

its delicate paper balance through '
"credit card" financing.
The President's final budget
message to Congress envisioned a
SI .."5 billion surplus in the 12
months starting July 1, but made
it contingent on an increase in
postal rates, a boost in gasoline
taxes and a pickup in business.
RISEN lIOWKH, who refused to
call the current economic situa
tion a recession, seemed to have
little doubt about business. He
said the economy crossed the half
trillion dollar mark last year for
the first time and "further sub
stantial increases" are in sight in
1961.
He added, however, that grow-j
ing national security needs—de
fense, foreign aid and space ex

programs such as medical care j

in the foreseeable future.
While underscoring his aim of {
"peace with justice," Eisenhower [
proposed a $1.4 billion step-up in I
defense spending to a record !
peacetime total of $42.9 billion, j
He .said much of the money would |
go for missile-age weapons and 1
would "keep our military the I
strongest in the world."

callcd for a $250 million increase i
in foreign aid, raising the totali
to $3.6 billion. This would permit j
greater U.S. emphasis on pro
grams for restless Africa and in |
Latin America, where Castroism
still appeals to many.
Eisenhower sougnt $965 million ;
for civilian space projects, a hike i
of $195 million, in hopes of put ]
ting a man in orbit this year. He
earmarked $584 million of the de
fense figure for "military astro
nautics" such as spy-in-the-sky
and communications satellites.
Eisenhower conceded that Pres
ident-elect John F. Kenendy can
revise the requests as he sees fit
after he is sworn in next Friday. •
But he added in an apparent ref-i
erence to Democratic campaign
pledges that the nation cannot af
ford everything "being urged by
special groups."
"This budget,"he said, "reflects i
the conviction that military
strength and domestic advance
ment must be based on a sound
economy, and that fiscal integrity
is essential to the responsible con
duct of government affairs."
