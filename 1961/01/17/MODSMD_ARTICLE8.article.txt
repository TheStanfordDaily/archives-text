# Coffin—U.S. Obligated Morally to Aid Africa
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
"It is the moral obligation of every student graduating this year
to consider spending the next two years teaching in Africa," declared
Chaplain Coffin in Cubberley Auditorium last night.
"American philanthroph represents the gift without the giver,"
he said. "You have the unique oportunity of being able to answer

Africa's need for 300.000 sec
ondary school teachers."
THE YALE Chaplain stated
that the African American Insti
tute wants to place 300 teachers
this year. Almost any Stanford
graduate with a strong B.A. or
B.S. would be accepted.
"We Americans have to take :
more seriously the African need;
fro bread," declared Chaplain Cof
i fin. "When someone speaks about
! spiritual values, you may well be
i lieve that he is trying to avoid
: material responsibility.
"Americans should recognize!
that Africans don't believe we
love our neighbors as ourselves.
They don't believe we think all
men are created equal. And can
you blame them when the U.S.
1 and the seven colonial powers of
the world were the nations who
; abstained from the U.N. resolu
-1 tion to abolish colonialism?" Cof
! fin asked.
THE DYNAMIC speaker led
| fourteen American college stu
; dents in a work project in New
Guinea last summer, as part of
"Operation Crossroads Africa."
"The first question the Africans
invariably asked us was the race
question," Coffin explained. They
thought the problem was worse
than it really is, mainly because
the Soviets are "perfectly and fan
tastically adept" at propaganda.
"You can be sure that every Afri
can will know what happens at
Georgia University tomorrow."
