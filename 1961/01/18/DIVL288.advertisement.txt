This Program is designed to develop young, inex
perienced men for careers in life insurance sales
and sales management. It provides an initial train
ing period of 3 months (including 3 weeks at a
Home Office School) before the men move into full
sales work.
Those trainees who are interested in and who are
found qualified for management responsibility are
assured of ample opportunity to move on to such
work in either our field offices or in the Home Office
after an initial period in sales.
The Connecticut Mutual is a 114-year-old com
pany with 520,000 policyholder-members and over
four billion dollars of life insurance in force. Ag
gressive expansion plans provide unusual oppor
tunities for the limited number of men accepted
each year.
