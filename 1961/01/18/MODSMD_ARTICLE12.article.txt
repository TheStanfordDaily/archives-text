## Why Ignored? 
### 
Three of the complaints voiced
against Dinkelspiel Auditorium
are that it seats only 728 persons,
it has no backstage area for stor
ing conventional stage settings
and there are no facilities for
flying scenery.
The persons who make these
complaints, however, forget that
these features were designed on
purpose by Arch Lauterer to pre
vent any regression to the cen
turies-old style of theater still
prevalent today.
Memorial Auditorium is a per
fect example of this traditional
proscenium (or picture-frame)
stage with a high stage tower,
gridiron and scenery-flying ap*
paratus. But who would dare
argue that its much greater seat
ing capacity—more than twice as
great as Dinkelspiel's—makes up
lor its frightfully poor acoustics
and almost total lack of unity be
tween actors and audience?
As far as scenery-flying equip
ment is concerned, in 1950 Lau
terer pointed out that in 150 pro
ductions at the Civic Theater in
Cleveland this costly mechanism
was used only five times!
To replace the space-consuming
painted scenery he designed a
projection system to project
scenes onto the specially-treated
back wall of the stage. A gallery
to hold such projection equipment
was built into the stage ceiling.
It was never finished, however,
as, after Lauterer died before the
building was completed, "the pro
jections just never could be
worked out," according to Wen
doll Cole, associate professor of
Speech and Drama.
A nother conception of Lau
terer's was sliding screens on the
sides of the stage in place of the
usual curtains. This idea never
materialized either, as after Lau
terer left the scene the heating
men put the air ducts too low on
the sides of the stage. The tracks
for the screens were plastered
over, and grey curtains are now
hanging there.
While Dinkelspiel was designed
to be used for theater and opera
(and to Lauterer, opera was, or
should be, a cohesive combina
tion of dance, drama and music),
many of the operas most suitable
for production are from the Nine

teenth Century and have require
ments which a modern stage
would have difficulty meeting,
Cole said.
"However, Lauterer hoped to
re-think the whole problem of
staging operas and purposely de
signed the building to prevent
conventional staging," Cole added.
And Music Professor Harold
Schmidt agreed strongly.
"No one was ever trained to
use the auditorium," according to
John Planting, Dinkelspiel's sec
retary-manager, and this is why
a resident director, who has the
knowledge, time and authority to
investigate and work with the
auditorium for several years, is
needed.
The last opera produced by the
Music Department was in May,
1959, Rossini's "Count Ory," di
rected by Frederic Cohen, oper
atic stage director of the Juilliard
School of Music in New York.
In April of 1958, the Eighteenth
Century "Thomas and Sally"
along with Gian-Carlo Menotti's
"The Unicorn, the Gorgon and
The Manticore," was presented,
and, before this, "The Ballad of
Baby Doe" had officially opened
Dinkelspiel in May, 1957.
Previous to this Dr. Jan Popper,
now at Ihe University of Cali
fornia, was establishing an opera
workshop here about 1945. Pop- \
per's productions, which contin-j
ued to 1949, were largely separate I
from the Music Department, how-1
ever, with local professionals and
student artists-in-residence taking ;
part.
Beginning in about 1940, a j
scries was given by both the De
partments of Speech and Drama:
and Music working together.
Staged in Memorial Auditorium,
the operas were elaborate and
well done (some were taken up
to the San Francisco Opera
House) and included many pre
mieres.
These annual operas were dis- [
continued in 1955 and have not j
| been resumed since.
But now, when the Stanford
campus includes a perfect struc
ture designed for opera and thea-;
ter productions, perhaps both de
partments could again join forces
and together produce some out
standing shows in Dinkelspiel.
