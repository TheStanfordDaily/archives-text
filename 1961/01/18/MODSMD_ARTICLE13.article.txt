# 'Kiss Me Kate'
## Play Within a Play 
### 
Cole Porter's "Kiss Me Kate" is
a lively musical about a play
within a play, William Shake
speare's "The Taming of the
Shrew." Produced by Comedia
Repertory Company, the show
features the same exuberance
and sense of fun which have come
to characterize all of the musicals
produced by this group in the
past.
Itself a play within a play, or
musical within a musical, "Kiss
Me Kate" is concerned with an
off-Broadway drama group and its
production of a musical version
of Shakespeare's "Shrew."
The stars of the group are a re
cently-divorced couple who, as
Kate and Petmchio, take advan
tage of their opportunities to bat
tle it out on stage as well as off.
Playing the actress who plays |
Kate, Lila Lloyd does an excellent ;
job with an excellent voice. Espe-1
cially notable are her solos "So
in Love" and"I Hate Men."
Her Pctruchio and ex-husband
is played by Allen Praefke, who,
like Miss Lloyd, comes to the pro
duction with a background of
leading roles with the San Jose
Light Opera Company. While dis
playing a fine voice and knack
for comedy throughout, Praefke's
best numbers are "I've Come to
Wive it Wealthily in Padua" and i
"Where is the Life that Late Ii
Led?"
A supporting role is taken by :
Philip Scluiltz, one of Coniedia's !
leading actors. While I lie part is
very minor, Scluiltz makes it
hilarious with facial expressions
which s«M'ni almost unintentional.
Corrine Kason, who danced in

last quarter's "Big Game Gaie
ties," takes the role of Bianca in
the play's play. Miss Kason has a
good voice and a vivacity which
makes her appearances delightful.
However, her face lacks expres
sion at times and prevents her
characterization from really
sparkling.
The funniest roles in the show
are two Damon Runyon charac
ters who wind up on stage in
Shakespearean costumes. Played
by Nick Weber and Michael Cline,
the two sing an hilarious number,
"Brush Up Your Shakespeare,"
as a result of their experiences
and were brought back for three
encores by last Saturday's audi
ence.
The most distracting element
in the Comedia production is the
chorus which appears amateurish
and awkard. While doing a good
job vocally, their appearances
seem undirected ami unpolished.
The dancing, too, is noticeably
bad, especially so since Comedia's
dance numbers are usually most
enjoyable to watch. With one ex
ception. "Too Darn Hot," the
choreography is dull and ineffec
tive, and the dancers show no real
life.
Margot Jones, who was chore
ographer for "Gaieties" this year,
makes several good appearances,
but her work in the show's opener
is hampered by the chorus.
Produced by Peter Kump and
directed by Leslie Abbott, "Kiss
Me Kate" will continue Saturday
night at 8:30 at the Loft Theater,
Emerson at Hamilton, in Palo
Alto. Reservations may In> made
by calling DA 6-8317.

Playing the actress who plays |
Kate, Lila Lloyd does an excellent ;
job with an excellent voice. Espe-1
cially notable are her solos "So
in Love" and"I Hate Men."
Her Pctruchio and ex-husband
is played by Allen Praefke, who,
like Miss Lloyd, comes to the pro
duction with a background of
leading roles with the San Jose
Light Opera Company. While dis
playing a fine voice and knack
for comedy throughout, Praefke's
best numbers are "I've Come to
Wive it Wealthily in Padua" and i
"Where is the Life that Late Ii
Led?"
A supporting role is taken by :
Philip Scluiltz, one of Coniedia's !
leading actors. While I lie part is
very minor, Scluiltz makes it
hilarious with facial expressions
which s«M'ni almost unintentional.
Corrine Kason, who danced in

last quarter's "Big Game Gaie
ties," takes the role of Bianca in
the play's play. Miss Kason has a
good voice and a vivacity which
makes her appearances delightful.
However, her face lacks expres
sion at times and prevents her
characterization from really
sparkling.
The funniest roles in the show
are two Damon Runyon charac
ters who wind up on stage in
Shakespearean costumes. Played
by Nick Weber and Michael Cline,
the two sing an hilarious number,
"Brush Up Your Shakespeare,"
as a result of their experiences
and were brought back for three
encores by last Saturday's audi
ence.
The most distracting element
in the Comedia production is the
chorus which appears amateurish
and awkard. While doing a good
job vocally, their appearances
seem undirected ami unpolished.
The dancing, too, is noticeably
bad, especially so since Comedia's
dance numbers are usually most
enjoyable to watch. With one ex
ception. "Too Darn Hot," the
choreography is dull and ineffec
tive, and the dancers show no real
life.
Margot Jones, who was chore
ographer for "Gaieties" this year,
makes several good appearances,
but her work in the show's opener
is hampered by the chorus.
Produced by Peter Kump and
directed by Leslie Abbott, "Kiss
Me Kate" will continue Saturday
night at 8:30 at the Loft Theater,
Emerson at Hamilton, in Palo
Alto. Reservations may In> made
by calling DA 6-8317.
