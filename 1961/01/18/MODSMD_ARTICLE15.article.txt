## Eisenhower's Speech in Review 
### 
In his last messages on the
State of the Union and the budget,
President Eisenhower, as was his
constitutional duty, had stated his
own views about economic policy.
They differ importantly from
those of the incoming Kennedy ad
ministration, and they point to
certain basic issues which will
now be much discussed. As it hap
pens, there is available for the dis
cussion not only Mr. Kennedy's
campaign speeches but the report
of Prof. Paul A. Samuelson, which
was made public about ten days
ago.
As between the Eisenhower and
Kennedy positions on the reces
sion. Ihe budget, and the state of
the economy, there are two main
points of differences. The one is
about the current recession. The
other is about the general condi
tion of the American economy
since about 1955 when it has been
shaped by the Eisenhower-
Humphrey-Anderson policy.
On the recession, the President
expresses an unqualified optimism
that the recession will soon eiire
itself and that consequently we
shall have a small budgetary sur
plus by June 30 next. The Samuel
son report to Mr. Kennedy rejects
the idea that we can count oil the
recession curing itself quickly.
The report calls for some immedi
ate but moderate measures to re
flate the economy—something in
I the order of three to five billions
i of expenditures above the Eisen
hower level. But these suggestions
are followed by a warning that
the recession may grow worse.
That unemployment, which is
now about (5 per cent of the labor
I force, may rise to 7' z per cent,
I which is the peak for the post
war era. Should this happen, the
Kennedy administration is advised
] to prepare for still stronger meas
ures of reflation, including per
haps a teni|>orary cut in taxes.
As of now no one can tell
whether- the stronger measures
will be necessary. But there is
good reason to disbelieve in the
Eisenhower optimism about the
recession, that it will quickly cure
itself. There is an ominous and
pertinent precedent for this dis
belief. In early 1958, when the
second of the Eisenhower reces
sions was under way, the Presi
dent predicted a small budgetary
surplus for fiscal 1959, just as he
is now predicting a small surplus
for 1961 and a larger surplus for
1962. But in fact, because of the
recession, the 1959 budgetary year
ended with a deficit of $12,000,-
000,000, the largest deficit ever in
time of peace. After that, we must
look with caution and skepticism
at optimistic predictions that all
will right itself quickly, and that
nothing is needed except words
of confidence and hope.
The difference between Eisen
hower and Kennedy on the cur
rent recession is, however, not
nearly so important as their dif
fering views on the general con
dition of the economy.
President Eisenhower said in a
message on the State of the Union
that "the expanding American
economy passed the half-trillion
dollar mark in gross national
product early in 1960. The na
tion's output of goods and serv
ices is now nearly 25 per cent
higher than in 1952."
While the figures are true, the
impression of strong growth,

which they are meant to convey,
is misleading. For they leave out
of the picture the fact that since
1952 the population of the conti
nental United States ha.s grown
by something like 25,000,000 per
sons.
In the years 1955 to 1960—when
the consequences of the Korean
War were over and the Eisen
hower - Humphrey - Anderson eco
nomic policies were operating
our gross national product in
creased from $448,000,000,000 to
about $503,000,000,000. (This is
the president's "half-trillion.")
These figures mean a rate of
growth of 2.6 per cent per year,
which is among the very slowest
of the advanced industrial nations
of the world. Worse still, meas
ured against the increase of the
population, these figures mean
that annual production per cap
ita has increased by something
less than 1 per cent.
This sluggish rate of growth Is
at the root of many of our domes
tic and of our foreign problems.
The Samuelson report to Kennedy
says, "Had our economy pro
gressed since 1956- not at the
dramatic sprint of the Western
European and the Japanese econ
omies or at the rush of the con
trolled totalitarian system, but
simply at the modest pace made
possible by our labor force and
productivity trends—we could
have expected 1961 to bring a
gross national product some 10
per cent above the 500 billion dol
lar level we are now experienc
ing." This would mean, says the
report, that we would be produc
ing about 50 billions more per
year, and that at the present rate
of taxes this would produce a
budget surplus of ten billions.
Those who say that without in
flation or regimentation our rate
of growth cannot be increased
above the Eisenhower level should
ponder what it means to say this.
It means that we can no longer
achieve the rate of growth which
we have achieved for over a cen-

I tury. It means that, as compared
Willi all our economic competi
tors, not to speak of the Soviet
' Union, we have become —though
we are still the biggest of the lot
—sluggish and slow to develop.
I Must we accept this view of our
selves? Would it not be a good
thing to be a little less optimistic
about the recession which stares
us in the face and to have a little
more confidence in the American
future?
But this is not all. The Kennedy
administration will be concerned
j not only with the rate of growth
but with the kind of growth.
President Eisenhower's convic
tions on this point were put for
i ward most explicitly by the Chair
j man of his Council of Economic
| Advisors, Mr. Saulnier, who once
testified in 1919, "As I understand
lan economy, its ultimate purpose
; is to produce more consumer
goods. This is the object of evei-y
-thing we are working at: to pro
duce things for consumers." Then
he went on to say that "if you
take total gross national produc
tion. find in recent years it has
lagged. But if you look at. con
sumption the thing which, as I
say, I regard myself as being com
mitted to maximize you find that
we are doing better."
The results show that if this
was the right goal, the Eisen
! bower administration has reached
1 it. Between 1955 and the first
half of 19(50, personal consump
tion expenditure increased at the
! rat«' of 3.3 per cent per year,
whereas the whole economy grew
by only 2.6 per cent. This is not
the character of a sound and pro
iluent society—that, when sub
jected to an historic challenge,
when faced with an explosive
growth of population and its con
centration in great cities, personal
consumer expenditures grow
faster than expenditures for pro
ductive investment or for the na
tional defense.

ures of reflation, including per
haps a teni|>orary cut in taxes.
As of now no one can tell
whether- the stronger measures
will be necessary. But there is
good reason to disbelieve in the
Eisenhower optimism about the
recession, that it will quickly cure
itself. There is an ominous and
pertinent precedent for this dis
belief. In early 1958, when the
second of the Eisenhower reces
sions was under way, the Presi
dent predicted a small budgetary
surplus for fiscal 1959, just as he
is now predicting a small surplus
for 1961 and a larger surplus for
1962. But in fact, because of the
recession, the 1959 budgetary year
ended with a deficit of $12,000,-
000,000, the largest deficit ever in
time of peace. After that, we must
look with caution and skepticism
at optimistic predictions that all
will right itself quickly, and that
nothing is needed except words
of confidence and hope.
The difference between Eisen
hower and Kennedy on the cur
rent recession is, however, not
nearly so important as their dif
fering views on the general con
dition of the economy.
President Eisenhower said in a
message on the State of the Union
that "the expanding American
economy passed the half-trillion
dollar mark in gross national
product early in 1960. The na
tion's output of goods and serv
ices is now nearly 25 per cent
higher than in 1952."
While the figures are true, the
impression of strong growth,

which they are meant to convey,
is misleading. For they leave out
of the picture the fact that since
1952 the population of the conti
nental United States ha.s grown
by something like 25,000,000 per
sons.
In the years 1955 to 1960—when
the consequences of the Korean
War were over and the Eisen
hower - Humphrey - Anderson eco
nomic policies were operating
our gross national product in
creased from $448,000,000,000 to
about $503,000,000,000. (This is
the president's "half-trillion.")
These figures mean a rate of
growth of 2.6 per cent per year,
which is among the very slowest
of the advanced industrial nations
of the world. Worse still, meas
ured against the increase of the
population, these figures mean
that annual production per cap
ita has increased by something
less than 1 per cent.
This sluggish rate of growth Is
at the root of many of our domes
tic and of our foreign problems.
The Samuelson report to Kennedy
says, "Had our economy pro
gressed since 1956- not at the
dramatic sprint of the Western
European and the Japanese econ
omies or at the rush of the con
trolled totalitarian system, but
simply at the modest pace made
possible by our labor force and
productivity trends—we could
have expected 1961 to bring a
gross national product some 10
per cent above the 500 billion dol
lar level we are now experienc
ing." This would mean, says the
report, that we would be produc
ing about 50 billions more per
year, and that at the present rate
of taxes this would produce a
budget surplus of ten billions.
Those who say that without in
flation or regimentation our rate
of growth cannot be increased
above the Eisenhower level should
ponder what it means to say this.
It means that we can no longer
achieve the rate of growth which
we have achieved for over a cen-

I tury. It means that, as compared
Willi all our economic competi
tors, not to speak of the Soviet
' Union, we have become —though
we are still the biggest of the lot
—sluggish and slow to develop.
I Must we accept this view of our
selves? Would it not be a good
thing to be a little less optimistic
about the recession which stares
us in the face and to have a little
more confidence in the American
future?
But this is not all. The Kennedy
administration will be concerned
j not only with the rate of growth
but with the kind of growth.
President Eisenhower's convic
tions on this point were put for
i ward most explicitly by the Chair
j man of his Council of Economic
| Advisors, Mr. Saulnier, who once
testified in 1919, "As I understand
lan economy, its ultimate purpose
; is to produce more consumer
goods. This is the object of evei-y
-thing we are working at: to pro
duce things for consumers." Then
he went on to say that "if you
take total gross national produc
tion. find in recent years it has
lagged. But if you look at. con
sumption the thing which, as I
say, I regard myself as being com
mitted to maximize you find that
we are doing better."
The results show that if this
was the right goal, the Eisen
! bower administration has reached
1 it. Between 1955 and the first
half of 19(50, personal consump
tion expenditure increased at the
! rat«' of 3.3 per cent per year,
whereas the whole economy grew
by only 2.6 per cent. This is not
the character of a sound and pro
iluent society—that, when sub
jected to an historic challenge,
when faced with an explosive
growth of population and its con
centration in great cities, personal
consumer expenditures grow
faster than expenditures for pro
ductive investment or for the na
tional defense.

In his last messages on the
State of the Union and the budget,
President Eisenhower, as was his
constitutional duty, had stated his
own views about economic policy.
They differ importantly from
those of the incoming Kennedy ad
ministration, and they point to
certain basic issues which will
now be much discussed. As it hap
pens, there is available for the dis
cussion not only Mr. Kennedy's
campaign speeches but the report
of Prof. Paul A. Samuelson, which
was made public about ten days
ago.
As between the Eisenhower and
Kennedy positions on the reces
sion. Ihe budget, and the state of
the economy, there are two main
points of differences. The one is
about the current recession. The
other is about the general condi
tion of the American economy
since about 1955 when it has been
shaped by the Eisenhower-
Humphrey-Anderson policy.
On the recession, the President
expresses an unqualified optimism
that the recession will soon eiire
itself and that consequently we
shall have a small budgetary sur
plus by June 30 next. The Samuel
son report to Mr. Kennedy rejects
the idea that we can count oil the
recession curing itself quickly.
The report calls for some immedi
ate but moderate measures to re
flate the economy—something in
I the order of three to five billions
i of expenditures above the Eisen
hower level. But these suggestions
are followed by a warning that
the recession may grow worse.
That unemployment, which is
now about (5 per cent of the labor
I force, may rise to 7' z per cent,
I which is the peak for the post
war era. Should this happen, the
Kennedy administration is advised
] to prepare for still stronger meas
ures of reflation, including per

1952 the population of the conti
nental United States ha.s grown
by something like 25,000,000 per
sons.
In the years 1955 to 1960—when
the consequences of the Korean
War were over and the Eisen
hower - Humphrey - Anderson eco
nomic policies were operating
our gross national product in
creased from $448,000,000,000 to
about $503,000,000,000. (This is
the president's "half-trillion.")
These figures mean a rate of
growth of 2.6 per cent per year,
which is among the very slowest
of the advanced industrial nations
of the world. Worse still, meas
ured against the increase of the
population, these figures mean
that annual production per cap
ita has increased by something
less than 1 per cent.
This sluggish rate of growth Is
at the root of many of our domes
tic and of our foreign problems.
The Samuelson report to Kennedy
says, "Had our economy pro
gressed since 1956- not at the
dramatic sprint of the Western
European and the Japanese econ
omies or at the rush of the con
trolled totalitarian system, but
simply at the modest pace made
possible by our labor force and
productivity trends—we could
have expected 1961 to bring a
gross national product some 10
per cent above the 500 billion dol
lar level we are now experienc
ing." This would mean, says the
report, that we would be produc
ing about 50 billions more per
year, and that at the present rate
of taxes this would produce a
budget surplus of ten billions.
Those who say that without in
flation or regimentation our rate
of growth cannot be increased
above the Eisenhower level should
ponder what it means to say this.
It means that we can no longer
achieve the rate of growth which
we have achieved for over a cen-

I tury. It means that, as compared
Willi all our economic competi
tors, not to speak of the Soviet
' Union, we have become —though
we are still the biggest of the lot
—sluggish and slow to develop.
I Must we accept this view of our
selves? Would it not be a good
thing to be a little less optimistic
about the recession which stares
us in the face and to have a little
more confidence in the American
future?
But this is not all. The Kennedy
administration will be concerned
j not only with the rate of growth
but with the kind of growth.
President Eisenhower's convic
tions on this point were put for
i ward most explicitly by the Chair
j man of his Council of Economic
| Advisors, Mr. Saulnier, who once
testified in 1919, "As I understand
lan economy, its ultimate purpose
; is to produce more consumer
goods. This is the object of evei-y
-thing we are working at: to pro
duce things for consumers." Then
he went on to say that "if you
take total gross national produc
tion. find in recent years it has
lagged. But if you look at. con
sumption the thing which, as I
say, I regard myself as being com
mitted to maximize you find that
we are doing better."
The results show that if this
was the right goal, the Eisen
! bower administration has reached
1 it. Between 1955 and the first
half of 19(50, personal consump
tion expenditure increased at the
! rat«' of 3.3 per cent per year,
whereas the whole economy grew
by only 2.6 per cent. This is not
the character of a sound and pro
iluent society—that, when sub
jected to an historic challenge,
when faced with an explosive
growth of population and its con
centration in great cities, personal
consumer expenditures grow
faster than expenditures for pro
ductive investment or for the na
tional defense.

In his last messages on the
State of the Union and the budget,
President Eisenhower, as was his
constitutional duty, had stated his
own views about economic policy.
They differ importantly from
those of the incoming Kennedy ad
ministration, and they point to
certain basic issues which will
now be much discussed. As it hap
pens, there is available for the dis
cussion not only Mr. Kennedy's
campaign speeches but the report
of Prof. Paul A. Samuelson, which
was made public about ten days
ago.
As between the Eisenhower and
Kennedy positions on the reces
sion. Ihe budget, and the state of
the economy, there are two main
points of differences. The one is
about the current recession. The
other is about the general condi
tion of the American economy
since about 1955 when it has been
shaped by the Eisenhower-
Humphrey-Anderson policy.
On the recession, the President
expresses an unqualified optimism
that the recession will soon eiire
itself and that consequently we
shall have a small budgetary sur
plus by June 30 next. The Samuel
son report to Mr. Kennedy rejects
the idea that we can count oil the
recession curing itself quickly.
The report calls for some immedi
ate but moderate measures to re
flate the economy—something in
I the order of three to five billions
i of expenditures above the Eisen
hower level. But these suggestions
are followed by a warning that
the recession may grow worse.
That unemployment, which is
now about (5 per cent of the labor
I force, may rise to 7' z per cent,
I which is the peak for the post
war era. Should this happen, the
Kennedy administration is advised
] to prepare for still stronger meas
ures of reflation, including per
haps a teni|>orary cut in taxes.
As of now no one can tell
whether- the stronger measures
will be necessary. But there is
good reason to disbelieve in the
Eisenhower optimism about the
recession, that it will quickly cure
itself. There is an ominous and
pertinent precedent for this dis
belief. In early 1958, when the
second of the Eisenhower reces
sions was under way, the Presi
dent predicted a small budgetary
surplus for fiscal 1959, just as he
is now predicting a small surplus
for 1961 and a larger surplus for
1962. But in fact, because of the
recession, the 1959 budgetary year
ended with a deficit of $12,000,-
000,000, the largest deficit ever in
time of peace. After that, we must
look with caution and skepticism
at optimistic predictions that all
will right itself quickly, and that
nothing is needed except words
of confidence and hope.
The difference between Eisen
hower and Kennedy on the cur
rent recession is, however, not
nearly so important as their dif
fering views on the general con
dition of the economy.
President Eisenhower said in a
message on the State of the Union
that "the expanding American
economy passed the half-trillion
dollar mark in gross national
product early in 1960. The na
tion's output of goods and serv
ices is now nearly 25 per cent
higher than in 1952."
While the figures are true, the
impression of strong growth,

which they are meant to convey,
is misleading. For they leave out
of the picture the fact that since
1952 the population of the conti
nental United States ha.s grown

budget surplus of ten billions.
Those who say that without in
flation or regimentation our rate
of growth cannot be increased
above the Eisenhower level should
ponder what it means to say this.
It means that we can no longer
achieve the rate of growth which
we have achieved for over a cen-

I tury. It means that, as compared
Willi all our economic competi
tors, not to speak of the Soviet
' Union, we have become —though
we are still the biggest of the lot
—sluggish and slow to develop.
I Must we accept this view of our
selves? Would it not be a good
thing to be a little less optimistic
about the recession which stares
us in the face and to have a little
more confidence in the American
future?
But this is not all. The Kennedy
administration will be concerned
j not only with the rate of growth
but with the kind of growth.
President Eisenhower's convic
tions on this point were put for
i ward most explicitly by the Chair
j man of his Council of Economic
| Advisors, Mr. Saulnier, who once
testified in 1919, "As I understand
lan economy, its ultimate purpose
; is to produce more consumer
goods. This is the object of evei-y
-thing we are working at: to pro
duce things for consumers." Then
he went on to say that "if you
take total gross national produc
tion. find in recent years it has
lagged. But if you look at. con
sumption the thing which, as I
say, I regard myself as being com
mitted to maximize you find that
we are doing better."
The results show that if this
was the right goal, the Eisen
! bower administration has reached
1 it. Between 1955 and the first
half of 19(50, personal consump
tion expenditure increased at the
! rat«' of 3.3 per cent per year,
whereas the whole economy grew
by only 2.6 per cent. This is not
the character of a sound and pro
iluent society—that, when sub
jected to an historic challenge,
when faced with an explosive
growth of population and its con
centration in great cities, personal
consumer expenditures grow
faster than expenditures for pro
ductive investment or for the na
tional defense.

In his last messages on the
State of the Union and the budget,
President Eisenhower, as was his
constitutional duty, had stated his
own views about economic policy.
They differ importantly from
those of the incoming Kennedy ad
ministration, and they point to
certain basic issues which will
now be much discussed. As it hap
pens, there is available for the dis
cussion not only Mr. Kennedy's
campaign speeches but the report
of Prof. Paul A. Samuelson, which
was made public about ten days
ago.
As between the Eisenhower and
Kennedy positions on the reces
sion. Ihe budget, and the state of
the economy, there are two main
points of differences. The one is
about the current recession. The
other is about the general condi
tion of the American economy
since about 1955 when it has been
shaped by the Eisenhower-
Humphrey-Anderson policy.
On the recession, the President
expresses an unqualified optimism
that the recession will soon eiire
itself and that consequently we
shall have a small budgetary sur
plus by June 30 next. The Samuel
son report to Mr. Kennedy rejects
the idea that we can count oil the
recession curing itself quickly.
The report calls for some immedi
ate but moderate measures to re
flate the economy—something in
I the order of three to five billions
i of expenditures above the Eisen
hower level. But these suggestions
are followed by a warning that
the recession may grow worse.
That unemployment, which is
now about (5 per cent of the labor
I force, may rise to 7' z per cent,
I which is the peak for the post
war era. Should this happen, the
Kennedy administration is advised
] to prepare for still stronger meas
ures of reflation, including per
haps a teni|>orary cut in taxes.
As of now no one can tell
whether- the stronger measures
will be necessary. But there is
good reason to disbelieve in the
Eisenhower optimism about the
recession, that it will quickly cure
itself. There is an ominous and
pertinent precedent for this dis
belief. In early 1958, when the
second of the Eisenhower reces
sions was under way, the Presi
dent predicted a small budgetary
surplus for fiscal 1959, just as he
is now predicting a small surplus
for 1961 and a larger surplus for
1962. But in fact, because of the
recession, the 1959 budgetary year
ended with a deficit of $12,000,-
000,000, the largest deficit ever in
time of peace. After that, we must
look with caution and skepticism
at optimistic predictions that all
will right itself quickly, and that
nothing is needed except words
of confidence and hope.
The difference between Eisen
hower and Kennedy on the cur
rent recession is, however, not
nearly so important as their dif
fering views on the general con
dition of the economy.
President Eisenhower said in a
message on the State of the Union
that "the expanding American
economy passed the half-trillion
dollar mark in gross national
product early in 1960. The na
tion's output of goods and serv
ices is now nearly 25 per cent
higher than in 1952."
While the figures are true, the
impression of strong growth,

which they are meant to convey,
is misleading. For they leave out
of the picture the fact that since
1952 the population of the conti
nental United States ha.s grown
by something like 25,000,000 per
sons.
In the years 1955 to 1960—when
the consequences of the Korean
War were over and the Eisen
hower - Humphrey - Anderson eco
nomic policies were operating
our gross national product in
creased from $448,000,000,000 to
about $503,000,000,000. (This is
the president's "half-trillion.")
These figures mean a rate of
growth of 2.6 per cent per year,
which is among the very slowest
of the advanced industrial nations
of the world. Worse still, meas
ured against the increase of the
population, these figures mean
that annual production per cap
ita has increased by something
less than 1 per cent.
This sluggish rate of growth Is
at the root of many of our domes
tic and of our foreign problems.
The Samuelson report to Kennedy
says, "Had our economy pro
gressed since 1956- not at the
dramatic sprint of the Western
European and the Japanese econ
omies or at the rush of the con
trolled totalitarian system, but
simply at the modest pace made
possible by our labor force and
productivity trends—we could
have expected 1961 to bring a
gross national product some 10
per cent above the 500 billion dol
lar level we are now experienc
ing." This would mean, says the
report, that we would be produc
ing about 50 billions more per
year, and that at the present rate
of taxes this would produce a
budget surplus of ten billions.
Those who say that without in
flation or regimentation our rate
of growth cannot be increased
above the Eisenhower level should
ponder what it means to say this.
It means that we can no longer
achieve the rate of growth which
we have achieved for over a cen-
