Editor, Th«' Daily:
As one who attended all three
days of ihe hearings of the House
Committee on Un-American Activ
ities last May and one who saw
the unedited sot of television films
in the Los Altos American Legion
Hall last June 19, and as one who
has seen the edited version of
"Operation Abolition" many times ,
I wish to emphatically state that
the movie in my opinion gives a
very true impression of what took
place at the hearings.
Since you felt free to quote Mr.
Paul Jacobs of Reporter magazine
whom you obviously consider an
authority, please permit me to
quote J. Edgar Hoover, whom I,
along with many other Ameri
cans, consider an authority. In his
report on the riots "Communist
Target Youth" he says:
"It is vitally important that not
only the students involved in that
incident but also students through
out the nation whom the Com
munists hope to exploit in similar
situations, recognize the Commu
nist tactics which resulted in what
West Coast observers familiar
with Communist strategy and
tactics have termed the most suc
cessful Communist coup to occur
in San Francisco in 25 years."
Mr. Hoover then goes on to do
scribe in great detail plans used
and the individuals (delegates to
the Communist convention in
New York, 1959 -— Communist
Party district committee member,
etc.) who actually organized the
student interest at the different
Bay Area campuses.
Judge A. A. Axelrod, who was
involved in the court hearing of
the students arrested for rioting,
said "he very definitely" agrees
with FBI Director J.Edgar Hoover,
that the City Hall riot and mob
demonstrations were instigated
by Communist elements and that
"there was no question in his
mind the college students among
those arrested were pawns of sub
versives."
In the light of this information
by such prominent and respected
public figures as Mr. Hoover and
Mr. Axelrod which directly con
flicts with your source Mr. Jacobs
(whose prominence at least is a
question! I would doubt your
willingness to give your readers
the complete truth.

I was frightened by the lead
paragraph in a Daily story which
quoted me as saying, in a speech
before the Sigma Nu's. "I have
never been «o frightened in any
country as I have been in Cuba."
This sounds a bit Class-B movie
ish and makes it appear like I
was quivering behind every lamp
post in Havana. Actually, the sen
tence was quoted out of context.
I went on to say that I was fright
ened because irrevocably and un
deniably, it was clear that the
Cuban revolution was for export.
The last paragraph also mud
dled what I was attempting to
say. That is, I don't believe that
Cuba is a puppet of either the
Soviet Union or Red China at this
moment. Castro is doing every
thing that Moscow and Peking
would want him to do anyway,
and therefore Mao and Khru
shchev need not risk a possibly

embarrassing formal political
link-up at this time. However,
there is obviously very close co
operation.
In my salad days as an under
grad at Stanford, I was also a
seibbler on The Daily, and, 1 am
sure, quoted people out of con
text. The chickens must be com
ing home to roost.

Editor, The Daily:
In The Daily of Jan. 16, 1961,
you printed a letter from William
Mandel containing excerpts from
the transcript of his testimony
before the Committee on Un-
American Activities. These ex
cerpts, by implication, give the im
pression that he was denying
membership in the Communist
Party.
Let us go back a few years, to
Feb. 14, 19.32, when Mr. William
Marx Mandel was testifying be
fore the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee:
Mr. Morris. Were you, in fact a
member of the Communist Party?
Mr. William Mandel. 1 must re
fuse to answer that question
under my privilege of the fifth
amendment against testifying
against myself.
In the book, "The Decline of
American Communism," by David
A. Shannon, pages 332-333, is an
excerpt of William Mandel's
speech at a recent Convention of
the Communist Party of America,
i This book is available on campus,
and should be read by all students
interested in domestic, as well as
foreign communism.)
Peter E. Erickson
Editor, The Daily:
The edit oral of a couple of
weeks ago in which you ques
tioned the action of the United
States in ending diplomatic rela
tions with Cuba, was probably one
of the most ridiculous I have read
in some time. I think perhaps a
little deep thought into the situ
ation would have prevented you
from following the lead of Dr.
Hilton.
Our diplomatic corps in Cuba
had been reduced from 118, to 62,
to 18 in the weeks proceeding the
decision.
Now I ask you this question:
Was it better for us to leave Cuba
on our own, or do you think we
should have waited until our
force there was reduced further
and Castro threw us out?
