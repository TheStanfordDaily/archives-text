### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Southern Col Rotes Tops
After a month or so of college basketball it seems certain that
Southern Cal is the team to beat on the West Coast.
Just two weeks ago UCLA, as the word from the South had it,
was the region's powerhouse. The Bruins got their support after a
second-place finish losing only to Iowa- in the Los Angeles Classic.
Hiding along on the tide of their publicity, the Bruins made the na
tion's top ten listing before the Washington Huskies promptly
knocked out the props, smashing the Southlanders in UCLA's first
AAWU game and almost repeating the feat the next night.
Cal was next in line for special mention but SC took two games
away from the Berkeley Golden Ones and Stanford added the

clincher. Its embarrassing, nut
whenever Stanford heats someone
in anything, the loser is written
off for the remainder of the sea
son. At least Cal was.
That leaves Iho Southern Cal
Trojans on top of the Big Fivo
stack at four wins, no losses with
the favorite's role to win the
NCAA Far West Regionals to tie
held in Portland, March 18.
The Stanford quint is also un
defeated in AAWU action but the
locals have appeared in only one
league game. Whether the Indi
ans can go all the way is a ques
tion mark; they started slowly
hut have come along fast and
have won four of their last six
starts.
BIG SU K PHIS E for Coach
Howie Dallmar lately has been
the high scoring of John Hendry,
the veteran senior forward. Hen-

dry. short for a forward at 6-3, had featured defense and rebounding
as his strong suits during the last two seasons.
Hendry's scoring averages for the 1959-60 campaign was a modest
seven points per gace. This season he started out much in the same
fashion, even hitting at a level slighlly below last year's.
Then the Farmers went against Cal two weeks ago to open their
regular AAVVU action and Hendry began to show some hidden talent.
John was the top scorer in that affair with a game total of 38
hitting on eight of his 13 field goal attempts.
AGAINST OREGON John kept up the barrage scoring 15 and
16 points as tlie Indians split with the Ducks.
Hendry's favorite weapon is the jump, along the baseline, from
the key or just to the side of the basket. Jumping John's tremendous
leg springs puts him up and out of reach of opponents several inches
taller.
His 49-point total in the last three games is just five shy of his
total production in the eight previous games.
IF HE KEEPS up the pace, Hendry will add a big boost to Dall
mar's once sagging offense. Hendry, John Windsor, Bub Bowling
and the Clemetson brothers, Don and Doug, provide a good nucleus
for a winning ball club.
Question Mark
The only question mark is at center, and that one position might
be the difference. Rich Hosley, who is just returning to the hardwood
after missing last season because of an injury, and Mike Ledger
wood have been alternating at the post.
Both Hosley, a soph, and Ledgerwood, a junior, have the height
each stands 6-7 but both lack consistent scoring and rebounding
ability.
STATISTIC QUOTING is often overdone, yet many times the
facts and figures can best point out a team's strong and weak spots.
At this point in the season the record book shows that Stanford cen
ters have totaled 79 points in 11 games, while opposing centers have
accounted for 170.
Small differences are important in basketball; all of Stanford's
losses have been by eight points or less. When Washington goes
against the Cards in the pavilion this Friday and Saturday they
will bring along one of the coast's best pivot men in 6-6 Bill Hanson.
More help in the post is required if the Indians want to conquer the
Huskies or any of their other Big Five foes.
Golf Is Next
Let's leave the pavilion confines and step outside for a moment.
Does it seem like golf season to you?
IT SHOULD. If you've been listening to local sports radio shows
or reading some of the Bay Area sports pages you're probably now
ready to believe that the fairway pastime is in peak season.
Those who subscribe to the sporting media know that the pro
golf circuit is heading northward; the gypsy caravan has packed up
the mallet heads, wedges and cardigans and is invading for a two
week stay.
The most well known Bay Area golf attarction of course, is Ihe
annual Bing Crosby Clambake. The Crosby, held jointly on the Pebble
Beach, Cypress Point and Monterey links, will begin this Thursday
and run for four days.
AS USUAL THE TOURNEY features the best pro golfers, the
Arnold Palmers and the Ken Venturis, in a 72-hole medal trial for
a $5,000 top prize. On the side the pros will team with a conglomera
tion of celebrities, duffers and amateur stars in an almost equally
lucrative pro-am event.
Palmer, winning his last start at San Diego with a closing round
of 65 is almost certain to be favored; Venturi will be back to defend
his Crosby title and hopefully shut the door on talented Arnold.
After the Crosby most of the tour stars will stick around for
the Luck Open, to be held the following week on the Harding Park-
Course in San Francisco.
THEN ADI) IN THE ARRIVAL of another pro trupe, this one
being Jack Kramer's professional tennis troupe. The play-for-pay
racketmen will hold matches at the Cow Palace, also this weekend.
Pancho Gonzales and Lew Hoad are two of the top stars to be
featured. Gonzales is currently among the leaders in round robin
competition and many observers rate him as the all-time best in the
net game; Hoad gained fame as the leader of Australia's winning
Davis Cup teams. Two of Kramer's new acquisitions from the ama
teur ranks are Earl Buchholz and Barry MacKav, the tempermental
American Davis Cuppers, and Mackay has moved right up to a con
tending position behind Gonzalves and Spanish ace Andres Gimeno.
Look's like a big weekend for the sport enthusiasts.
