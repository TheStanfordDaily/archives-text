## NFL Winning War Over Pro Grid Drafts 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI) â€” The National Football League is winning!
the war with the young American League over ihe signing of the best |
college players for next season, a United Press International survey
showed today.
Although the opportunities for making the grade appear to be i

better in the A.F.L., Ihe leading!
college stars, by a ratio of more!
than 2 to 1, have indicated they'
would rather risk their pro play
ing chances in the tougher-to
make N.F.L.
N.F.L. clubs have signed 33 of
their leading 19 draft picks, ac
cording to the U.P.I, survey; A.-
F.L. clubs have announced the
signing of only 11 of their top 31
choices. Seventeen of these A.-1
F.L. draftees already have signed
with N.F.L. clubs and one has i
gone to Canada (All-America'
guard Tom Brown of Minnesota).
SO FAR, 9 of the 13 N.F.L.
teams have signed their No. 1 i
pick. Not one N.F.L. team has j
lost a first draft choice to either;
the A.F.L. or the Canadian league. 1
Four other N.F.L. top choices can
not sign a pro contract because j
i hey have eligibility remaining in
other college sports.
In contrast, only 2 of the R A.- j
F.L. teams have signed their top
draft picks. These are All-Amer- 1
ica center E. J. Holub of Texas
Tech, signed by the Dallas Tex
ans, and end Earl Faison of In
diana, signed by the oLs Angeles
Chargers.
Holub also was the second draft
choice of the Dallas Cowboys in
the N.F.L. and Faison was the
No. 5 pick of the Detroit Lions.
BESIDES Holub and Faison.
the only two college stars who so
far have preferred the younger
league to the N.F.L. were Fred
Arbanas of Michigan State and
Stew Barber of Penn State. Ar
banas, signed by the Texans, was
the No. 2 choice of the St. Louis |
Cardinals; Barber, who cast his!
lot with the Buffalo Bills, was the
No. 3 pick of the N.F.L. Dallas {
Cowboys.
In analyzing the N.F.L. sign
ings, it should be pointed out that i
each club in the older league was!
reasonably certain of corraling its
No. 1 pick at the time of the draft.
During the N.F.L. draft meet-!
ing last month, before selecting a
player, each club telephoned him
to determine whether he was com
mitted to an A.F.L. or a Canadian
team. If so, the N.F.L. shied away
from him.
American Football League clubs
drafted in November, before they
had any indication whether they
could sign their preferences.
MOST OF THEM thus gambled
and lost. The Denver Broncos and
New York Titans have not an
nounced the signing of any of
hteir first 5 draft picks; the Bos
ton Patriots have managed to
sign anly their No. 4 selection.
Of the 5 players who were made \
the first draft choice of clubs in
both leagues, four already have
signed with the N.F.L.
These were: Mike Ditka of Pitt,
who chose the Chicago Bears over ;
the Houston Oilers; Joe Rutgens
of Illinois, Washington Redskins

over Oakland; Bob Gaiters of
New Mexico State, New York
Giants over Denver; and Tommy
Mason of Tulane, whose signing
has not been announced yet but is
known to have chosen the new
Minnesota Vikings over Boston.
OTHEK No. 1 N.F.L. draft
choices already signed are; Herb
Adderley of Mic hi g a n State,
Green Bay Packers; Tom Matte,
Ohio State, Baltimore Colts; Bob
Lilly, Texas Christian, Dallas
Cowboys; Bob Respino, Missis
sippi, Cleveland Browns; and My
ron Pottios, Notre Dame, Pitts
burgh St colors.
The most successful N.F.L.
clubs in signing draft picks have
been the Packers, Giants, Red
skins and San Francisco Forty-
Niners. Green Bay has signed its
top 3 draft picks; Washington 5
of its first 7; New York 4 of its
first ;5, and San Francisco 3 of
its first 4.
IN THE A.F.L., Ihe Los Angeles
Chargers have signed their first
2 picks and have announced they
have 8 of their first 11 choices
under contract. Buffalo has signed
3 of its first 6 selections, while
Dallas and Houston each has 2
of its first 3 choices.
