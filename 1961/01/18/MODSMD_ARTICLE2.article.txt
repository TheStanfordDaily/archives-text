# K. Threatens West's Position in W. Berlin

### 
MOSCOW (UPI> â€” Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, in a
speech published yesterday, once again threatened to force the West
to withdraw from Berlin.
In a 45-page discourse in the magazine Kommunist, Khrushchev
ranged through a host of other well-known Soviet political and

ideological positions.
Ho said time had shown that
the British, French, and Ameri
can positions were "especially
vulnerable" in West Berlin.
"These powers cannot fail to
realize that the occupation regime
in that city will end sooner or
later," he said. "It is necessary
to continue step by step to bring
the aggressive-minded imperial
ists to their senses, to compel
them to reckon with the real sit
uation.
"AND IF they balk," he added,
"we shall take resolute measure,
we shall sign a peace treaty with
the German (Communist) Demo
cratic Republic, for we are fully
determined to conclude a Gorman
peace treaty, to pull out the thorn
that the occupation regime in
West Berlin constitutes from the
heart of Europe."
Recalling the 1956 Suez crisis,
Khrushchev said of the British:
"We taught them plainly: 'If you
start a war. you'll lose it. We
will not be neutral.' "
KHRUSHCHEV said the Soviet
Union would stand behind "na
tional liberation wars" like those
of the Vietnames and Algerians.
"Such a war is not only per
missible but inevitable," he added.
"We recognize such wars; we
have helped and shall go on help
ing peoples fighting for their
freedom."
The Khrushchev speech was
made Jan. 6 to the Academy of
Social Sciences and the Commu
nist Party Central Committee In
stitute of Marxism-Leninism.
