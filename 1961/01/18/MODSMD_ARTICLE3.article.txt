ATHENS, Ga. (UPl>— Six Ku
Klux Klansmen were bound over
to a grand jury yesterday on
charges stemming from a riot on
the newly integrated University
of Georgia campus last week.
The two Negro students whose
presence sparked the riot Char
layne Hunter, 18, and Hamilton
Holmes, 19—attended classes at
the university for the second day
yesterday without incident.
As the Klansmen were being
hauled before a municipal judge,
local police announced they had
captured a man believed to be
the gunman who showed up at
Miss Hunter's dormitory Sunday
night and asked if the Negro co
ed was on campus. When told she
wasn't he took a gun from an
elderly guard and fled.
The six Klansmen were charged
with carrying weapons to a pub
lic gathering and were freed un
der $500 bond. Three other adults
picked up during the demonstra
tion did not appear in court, and
forfeited their bonds.
A number of plainclothesmen
were still on the University of
Georgia campus yesterday but
they stayed in the background as
Holmes and Miss Hunter went
normally about their business.
