## 
### 
HAVANA (UPl)—Three Cu
bans were executed as terrorists
today by Premier Fidel Castro's
firing squads which went back
into action to cope with growing
anti-government sentiment.
One of the three men executed
was charged with plotting to blow
up an ammunition dump while
the premier was in the vicinity in
an apparent attempt on his life.
THE EXECUTIONS were car
j ried out in a floodlighted area of
! Cabana Fortress across the bay
i from Havana less than an hour
| after the sentences were handed
■ down by a military tribunal.
' About 50 other accused terrorists
are involved in the continuing
; trials.
j The executed men were identi
fied as Balbino Diaz, Jose M.
, Mesa and Julio A. Yebra. Six
others received 30-year jail terms.
Today's pre-dawn executions, the
first of 1961, brought to 31 the
number of men shot by firing
, squads in the last 12 months.
More than 630 alleged war crimi
nals have been shot by the Castro
I regime since it seized power in

January 1959. The victims in
clude three Americans, executed
last year as counter-revolutiona
ries.
Despite the executions, anti-
Castro violence continued un
checked. A bomb exploded late
Monday night at the Santos Sua
vcz Reservoir. Several other bomb
explosions were reported, break
ing a fortnight's lull.
THE SIZE of the anti-Castro I
forces in central Cuba remained)
uncertain. The government put i
them at 100 while underground!
sources said some 4,000 were in- J
volved. Travelers reaching Ha-i
vana estimated at least 15,000 gov- ■
eminent troops were involved in!
what appeared to be an all-out ■
cleanup drive.
The Communist-dominated Cu-|
ban Confederation of Labor,
meanwhile, ousted another 360
members of the electrical work
ers. The men lost their jobs Mon
day with the nationalized Cuban
Elect lie Company because they
opposed government political pol
icy.

HAVANA (UPl)—Three Cu
bans were executed as terrorists
today by Premier Fidel Castro's
firing squads which went back
into action to cope with growing
anti-government sentiment.
One of the three men executed
was charged with plotting to blow
up an ammunition dump while
the premier was in the vicinity in
an apparent attempt on his life.
THE EXECUTIONS were car
j ried out in a floodlighted area of
! Cabana Fortress across the bay
i from Havana less than an hour
| after the sentences were handed
■ down by a military tribunal.
' About 50 other accused terrorists
are involved in the continuing
; trials.
j The executed men were identi
fied as Balbino Diaz, Jose M.
, Mesa and Julio A. Yebra. Six
others received 30-year jail terms.
Today's pre-dawn executions, the
first of 1961, brought to 31 the
number of men shot by firing
, squads in the last 12 months.
More than 630 alleged war crimi
nals have been shot by the Castro
I regime since it seized power in

January 1959. The victims in
clude three Americans, executed
last year as counter-revolutiona
ries.
Despite the executions, anti-
Castro violence continued un
checked. A bomb exploded late
Monday night at the Santos Sua
vcz Reservoir. Several other bomb
explosions were reported, break
ing a fortnight's lull.
THE SIZE of the anti-Castro I
forces in central Cuba remained)
uncertain. The government put i
them at 100 while underground!
sources said some 4,000 were in- J
volved. Travelers reaching Ha-i
vana estimated at least 15,000 gov- ■
eminent troops were involved in!
what appeared to be an all-out ■
cleanup drive.
The Communist-dominated Cu-|
ban Confederation of Labor,
meanwhile, ousted another 360
members of the electrical work
ers. The men lost their jobs Mon
day with the nationalized Cuban
Elect lie Company because they
opposed government political pol
icy.
