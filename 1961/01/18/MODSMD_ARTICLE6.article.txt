## 
### 
Registrar Harvey Hall cited
yesterday a number of high
schools in California and through
out the country whose graduates j
have made notable academic rec
ords at Stanford over the last j
three years.
In information taken from the :
annual Registrar's Report pub
lished by the University, Dr. Hall,
noted that among high schools
with large numbers of students j
entering Stanford the following I
schools' graduates have averaged \
grade point averages of 2.8 or i
higher: Arcadia High School (15
students), Newport Harbor High
School (17 students) and West)
Los Angeles' University High!
School (32 students) in Southern:
California; Oakland High School I
(14 students) and
C. K. MeClatchy High School (24 j
students) in the north; and New!
Trier High School (18 students)
in Winnetka, 111.
THE SIX STANFORD students
who have entered from Las Lo
mas High School in Walnut Creek '
have a combined average of 3.1 '
and Santa Ana High School's 8!
grads put together a phenomenal
3.6. according to the published,
report.
The Registrar's Report is sent.)
Hall said, to officials of each high
school represented at Stanford, j
and distributed to University offi
cials. Its purpose is primarily to I
aid the University in analyzing
its composition and making vari
ous observations regarding stu
dents, as well as to inform sec
ondary school officials how then
own graduates are doing, and not !
to rate or compare high schools, !
said Hall.
The over-all record shows that
students entering from public'
schools, on the average, earned
somewhat higher grades than,
those from private institutions,
the report shows.
THE REPORT also noted that
students who transfer to Stanford
from four-year institutions do
better, grade-wise, than those:
from junior colleges. Most en
trants to University graduate
schools come from Stanford, but
the University of California at ;
Berkeley has sent 208 scholars in j
the last three years, San Jose
State 1.56, the University of Wash- j
ington 81 and MIT, San Francisco
State, Harvard. UCLA and the
U.S. Naval Academy between TO
and 80 each.
Hall said that Palo Alto High
School had been Stanford's big
gest source of undergraduate stu-!
dents in the last three years with I
56 students, and San Marino High
School in Southern California sec- j
ond with 49.
