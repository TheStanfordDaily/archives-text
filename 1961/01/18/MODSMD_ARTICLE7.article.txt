### KATHEE DOWNING 
"Emerson College was created as a reaction to
existing colleges and universities," explained Alvin
j Duskin, a former graduate of Stanford University.
| The new college, which began its first quarter
! last April with seven students and five teachers,
' is located in an old Victorian house in Pacific
J Grove, California.
AT STANFORD last week on an extended tour
i of state campuses. Mr. Duskin, one of the founders
I of Emerson, and Ed Devlin, a student at the col
lege. described some of the courses offered.
"Fourteen classes are now being taught," ex
| plained Mr. Devlin, "ranging from Plato's dia
logues to a discussion of Castro by the President
! (in exilei of the Opposition Party of Mexico."
Duskin emphasized that students are also free
I to pursue individual courses of study. "The ten
teachers, who have to be good because inability to
i conduct a stimulating class is obvious and intoler
able with a small group, are able to help students
in individual fields of interest."
TWO STANFORD students will attend Emer
son litis spring quarter, beginning Eeb. (j. When
I asked what they intended to do at the new college,
they replied, "Emerson is not the type uÂ£ school

one attends to 'get things out of; we realize we
can learn there only if we have things to con
tribute ourselves."
Emerson College offers no degrees and does
not demand that students attend any set number
of quarters. Three quarters of study are offered
each year interspaced by periods of vacation.
"This school is a counter-movement to the in
creasing rigidity and lack of human contact of
most undergraduate schools," said Mr. Duskin.
Speaking about his visits to college campuses, he
explained, "We have not come to 'steal' students,
but to offer them the opportunity to attend for
a few quarters a school that has education as its
soul goal."
ALTHOUCiII STUDIONTS may rent apartments
in the three-story college, no regulations are en
forced as to the student's life outside the class.
Emerson was incorporated as an educational
institution by the State of California and was re
cently approved for alien students by the U.S.
Department of Justice.
