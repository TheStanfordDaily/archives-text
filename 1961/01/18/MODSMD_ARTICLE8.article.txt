# Castro Regime Has Warranted Scorn of Many'

### LIZ FREEMAN SANDY KINGSMITH 
"This (the Castro regime) has
earned the scorn of many," de
clared Luis A. Baralt, Jr., ex-
Castro diplomat, last night in his
speech as part of the "Cuba Now"
program sponsored by the Insti
tute of International Relations in
cooperation with Stanford's Com
mittee on Public Exercises.
In analyzing the present Cuban
situation, he said that Castro's
regime is as much or more of a
dictatorship than Batista's.
"There has never been in Cuba
such a thorough stifling of free
dom of speech or freedom of the
press."
IN GENERAL, "the Cuban gov
ernment is already a Communist
government." One indication is
that at Ihe U.N. Castro supported
Russia at all times. Over one-half
of Cuban trade is with the Soviet
Union and Russians and Chinese
are pouring into Havana every
day, he said.
The 1959 agricultural law Mr.
Baralt described as "absurd and
helter-skelter to say the least."
There has been violence of the
rights of small proprietors -
farmers have less income and no
property ownership, he explained.
Baralt slates that the only solu
tion to the present Cuban crisis is
a counter - revolution. Unit e d
States intervention in Cuba will
be labeled another Hungary not
only by the Communists but by
the nationalists within Cuba also.
"CUBAN efforts to overthrow
the Castro regime are more un
derway than it is commonly sup
posed." Two major counter-revo
lutionary forces exist. The Revo
lutionary Democratic Committee
is composed mainly of exiles,
disappointed former Castro sup
porters. ousted Cuban business
men, and Catholic laymen fight
ing for religious freedom.
The revolutionary movement of
the people within Cuba is "much
vaster" although they have less
resources. They fight by sabotage,
working with the independent
guerrillas in the hills. It has not
yet come to ideological agreement
with ih* 1 Revolutionary Demo
cratic Committee.
Commenting on the counter
revolutionary movements' chances
of success. Baralt questioned
whether the regime's leaders
would defend the government at
the risk of their lives. He ob
served that Castro faces the same
problem as Batista, in that the
army, although well-equipped for
war, will not fight against the
rebels, because it is morally
against the regime.
