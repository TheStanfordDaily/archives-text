# Ike Cautions Against Military-Scientific Elite
## Farewell Talk Climaxes War and Peace Service 
### 
WASHINGTON <UPI> President Eisenhower cautioned Amer
icans in a solemn farewell address last night against letting a mili
tary-scientific-industrial elite exert "unwarranted influence" over the
government during the struggle with world communism.
Ending 50 years of national service in war and peace, Ihe President

also 'old the nation it faced a long j
struggle against tho "hostile ide
ology" of Communism. He ad
vised Ihe people not to be tempted |
by what might appear to be some
"miraculous solution."
The 70-year-old chief executive.!
who eight years ago began his;
administration on a religious note,j
opened his nationwide radio-TV
speech with prayerful words fori
his successor, John F. Kennedy.
IN THE HEART of his 20-min-1
lite address, he called attention to
the rise since World War Ii of an i
"immense" military establishment j
and arms industry which, while |
imperative to defend the country, |
carries with it "grave implica
tions."
He said its influence already is
felt in every city, state and fed
eral office. He appealed to an
"alert" citizenry to "take nothing
for granted" and make sure that
this "military-industrial complex";
does not dominate the govern
ment.
EISENHOWER led into his re
marks on the military-industrial
combine by declaring that there
always is a temptation to meet
crises with some "spectacular and
costly action."
He said big increases in defense
spending or a dramatic expansion
in research have been proposed as
cure-alls. But these must be
weighed carefully to maintain
balance in national aims or "frus
tration" will result, he said.
Pointing to the rise of the mili
tary establishment and arms in
dustry in recent years, he said
that defense spending now runs
higher than the net income of all
U.S. corporations. Then he added:
"THIS CONJUNCTION of an
immense military establishment
and a large arms industry is new
in the American experience. In
the councils of government, we
must guard against the acquisi
tion of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by
the military-industrial complex.
"The potential for the disas
trous rise of displaced power ex
ists and will persist. We must
never let the weight of this com-i
bination endanger our liberty or;
democratic processes."
Eisenhower said he was leaving)
office with a definite sense of
disappointment because of the,
relative lack of progress in dis
armament negotiations with Rus
sia. It was in this connection he !
pledged to do what he could for j
peace.
"As one who has witnessed the'
horror and the lingering sadness
of war—as one who knows that ;
another war could utterly destroy
this civilization which has been so
slowly and painfully built over
thousands of years I wish I
could say tonight that a lasting!
peace is in sight," he said.
"HAFPILY, I can say that war
has been avoided. Steady progress
toward our ultimate goal has been
made. But, so much remains to j
be done.
"As a private citizen, I shall j
never cease to do what little II
can to help the world advance
along that road."
Eisenhower concluded his 20- J
minute talk with a statement of j
what he called America's continu-1
ing aspiration:
"WE PRAY the people of all
faiths, all races, all nations, may
have their great human needs sat
isfied; that those now denied op
portunity shall come to enjoy it i
to the full pinnacle; that all who!
yearn for freedom may experi j
ence its spiritual blessing; that
those who have freedom will un |
derstand. also, its heavy rcspon- 1
sibility; that all who are insensi
tive to the needs of others will |
learn charity; that the scourges
of poverty, disease and ignorance
will be made to disappear from |
the earth; and that in the good-1
ness of time, all peoples will come
to live together in a peace guar j 1
anteed by the binding force of mil j
tual respect and love."

Eisenhower concluded his 20- J

what he called America's continu-1

faiths, all races, all nations, may

WASHINGTON <UPI> President Eisenhower cautioned Amer

government during the struggle with world communism.
Ending 50 years of national service in war and peace, Ihe President

also 'old the nation it faced a long j
struggle against tho "hostile ide

"miraculous solution."
The 70-year-old chief executive.!
who eight years ago began his;
administration on a religious note,j
opened his nationwide radio-TV
speech with prayerful words fori
his successor, John F. Kennedy.
IN THE HEART of his 20-min-1
lite address, he called attention to
the rise since World War Ii of an i
"immense" military establishment j
and arms industry which, while |
imperative to defend the country, |
carries with it "grave implica
tions."
He said its influence already is
felt in every city, state and fed
eral office. He appealed to an
"alert" citizenry to "take nothing
for granted" and make sure that
this "military-industrial complex";
does not dominate the govern
ment.
EISENHOWER led into his re
marks on the military-industrial
combine by declaring that there
always is a temptation to meet
crises with some "spectacular and
costly action."
He said big increases in defense
spending or a dramatic expansion
in research have been proposed as
cure-alls. But these must be
weighed carefully to maintain
balance in national aims or "frus
tration" will result, he said.
Pointing to the rise of the mili
tary establishment and arms in
dustry in recent years, he said
that defense spending now runs
higher than the net income of all
U.S. corporations. Then he added:
"THIS CONJUNCTION of an
immense military establishment
and a large arms industry is new
in the American experience. In
the councils of government, we
must guard against the acquisi
tion of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by
the military-industrial complex.
"The potential for the disas
trous rise of displaced power ex
ists and will persist. We must
never let the weight of this com-i
bination endanger our liberty or;
democratic processes."
Eisenhower said he was leaving)
office with a definite sense of
disappointment because of the,
relative lack of progress in dis
armament negotiations with Rus
sia. It was in this connection he !
pledged to do what he could for j
peace.
"As one who has witnessed the'
horror and the lingering sadness
of war—as one who knows that ;
another war could utterly destroy
this civilization which has been so
slowly and painfully built over
thousands of years I wish I

Pointing to the rise of the mili
tary establishment and arms in
dustry in recent years, he said
that defense spending now runs
higher than the net income of all
U.S. corporations. Then he added:
"THIS CONJUNCTION of an
immense military establishment
and a large arms industry is new
in the American experience. In
the councils of government, we
must guard against the acquisi
tion of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought, by
the military-industrial complex.
"The potential for the disas
trous rise of displaced power ex
ists and will persist. We must
never let the weight of this com-i
bination endanger our liberty or;
democratic processes."
Eisenhower said he was leaving)
office with a definite sense of
disappointment because of the,
relative lack of progress in dis
armament negotiations with Rus
sia. It was in this connection he !
pledged to do what he could for j
peace.
"As one who has witnessed the'
horror and the lingering sadness
of war—as one who knows that ;
another war could utterly destroy
this civilization which has been so
slowly and painfully built over
thousands of years I wish I
could say tonight that a lasting!
peace is in sight," he said.
"HAFPILY, I can say that war
has been avoided. Steady progress
toward our ultimate goal has been
made. But, so much remains to j
be done.
"As a private citizen, I shall j
never cease to do what little II
can to help the world advance
along that road."
Eisenhower concluded his 20- J
minute talk with a statement of j
what he called America's continu-1
ing aspiration:
"WE PRAY the people of all
faiths, all races, all nations, may
have their great human needs sat
isfied; that those now denied op
portunity shall come to enjoy it i
to the full pinnacle; that all who!
yearn for freedom may experi j
ence its spiritual blessing; that
those who have freedom will un |
derstand. also, its heavy rcspon- 1
sibility; that all who are insensi
tive to the needs of others will |
learn charity; that the scourges
of poverty, disease and ignorance
will be made to disappear from |
the earth; and that in the good-1
ness of time, all peoples will come
to live together in a peace guar j 1
anteed by the binding force of mil j
tual respect and love."
