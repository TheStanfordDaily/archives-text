traditional field into other market areas, both military and industrial. The Aeronautics Division, which supplies
the new all-weather Crusader to the Navy and is at work on other aircraft and missile projects, is also
headquarters for a company-wide anti-submarine effort • The Astronautics Division — deep into studies for
manned space flight — is prime vehicle contractor for the NASA Scout and a key contractor on the Air Force
Blue Scout Junior, both research rockets • An aggressive Electronics Division supplies components and
systems to major U. S. defense and research programs • Vought Range Systems is a world-wide service
organization with space-tracking, range instrumentation and many other responsibilities • Vought Research
Center feeds basic knowledge to all divisions • A subsidiary — Vought Industries, Inc.— is the nation's
ieading producer of mobile homes • Another subsidiary — Information Systems, Inc. — produces industrial
automation and process control equipment • National Data Processing Corporation, in which Chance Vought
