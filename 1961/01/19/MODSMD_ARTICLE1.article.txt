# Tresidder Groundbreaking Slated for Spring Quarter
## 
### 
Bids for construction of Tresid
der Memorial Union will be in
vited in late February, according
to the present timetable, with
groundbreaking lo come in April.
All this is "almost certain," ac
cording to University officials.
Activation date is now Septem
ber, 1962.
Even though the funds for the
project are still over $200,000
short, the present scheduled will
probably be followed, said Rollin
M. Warner, University develop
ment official working dircetly on
Ihe Union project. Remaining
necessary funds are expected to
be contributed soon.
The design budget for the new
Union is set at $2,675,000, accord
ing to Daniel J. Rolfs, of the
Planning Office. While this fig
ure is the best estimate that
planners can make, actual bids
are hoped to be close lo this be
cause of variations in furnishings
and equipment costs.
PLANS FOR the building, de
signed by San Francisco archi
tects Spencer and Lee, are com
plete. According to Chester A.
Berry, director of Tresidder Union
planning, most recent additions to
the plans are a travel bureau and
1,000 additional square feet al
loted to the ASSIJ section of the
building's upper level. The build
ing site is between Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and Bowman Alumni
House. Already in the plans were

a barber shop, billiard and table I
tennis rooms, a 1 Mane bowling
alley, a store and kitchen and a
variety of dining areas on the
lower level. On the upper level
will be lounges and meeting
rooms of various and adjustable
sizes, an indoor-outdoor exhibi
tion gallery, a browsing room

i library and offices for the Union
management and ASSU.
TRESIDDER Union will be "an
extroverted kind of development,"
said Berry, in contrast to planned
new living groups which will be
introverted in nature. Comment
ing on possible completion for
student interest he noted that

Tresidder is to be a eomplimen
tary facility with as lew duplica
tions as possible of other develop
ments while still adequately serv
ing off campus students and the
general University community
with a satisfactory place for gath
erings and activities presently im
possible on the campus.

be contributed soon.
The design budget for the new
Union is set at $2,675,000, accord
ing to Daniel J. Rolfs, of the
Planning Office. While this fig
ure is the best estimate that
planners can make, actual bids
are hoped to be close lo this be
cause of variations in furnishings
and equipment costs.
PLANS FOR the building, de
signed by San Francisco archi
tects Spencer and Lee, are com
plete. According to Chester A.
Berry, director of Tresidder Union
planning, most recent additions to
the plans are a travel bureau and
1,000 additional square feet al
loted to the ASSIJ section of the
building's upper level. The build
ing site is between Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and Bowman Alumni
House. Already in the plans were

a barber shop, billiard and table I
tennis rooms, a 1 Mane bowling
alley, a store and kitchen and a
variety of dining areas on the
lower level. On the upper level
will be lounges and meeting
rooms of various and adjustable
sizes, an indoor-outdoor exhibi
tion gallery, a browsing room

i library and offices for the Union
management and ASSU.
TRESIDDER Union will be "an
extroverted kind of development,"
said Berry, in contrast to planned
new living groups which will be
introverted in nature. Comment
ing on possible completion for
student interest he noted that

Tresidder is to be a eomplimen
tary facility with as lew duplica
tions as possible of other develop
ments while still adequately serv
ing off campus students and the
general University community
with a satisfactory place for gath
erings and activities presently im
possible on the campus.
