### 
Tchaikowski's best known and
most popular opera, "Eugene
Onegin" will appear tomorrow
at 8:1."> p.m.. in Memorial Audi
torium. The film version, pro
duced in Soviet Russia, features
the soloists, chorus, ballet corp
and orchestra of both the re
nowned Bolshoi Opera Company
of Moscow, and the Leningrad Ac
ademic Theater of Opera and
Bftllet.
The opera, adapted from the
Pushkin novel is the story of a
young St. Petersburg aristocrat,
his loves, his duels, but primarily
his search for himself.
Till; COMBINATION of action,
irony and intrigue, in conjunction
with the romantic style of Tchai
kowski's music, makes the opera
well-suited to the lavish treat
ment typical of Ihe late Soviet
cultural cinema.
