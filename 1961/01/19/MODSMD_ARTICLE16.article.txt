# An Ugly Situation
## 
### 
Prejudice is an outgrowth of fear and fear is an outgrowth of
ignorance. One benefit gained from attending Stanford I niversity
or any other great academic institution is that students grow out
of their ignorance and therefore their prejudices.
Unfortunately, the same can not he said of people who live
around Stanford. Many of them are ignorant and therefore many
of them are prejudiced. Some Stanford students wlio are members
of minority groups have discovered this all too often.
In Tuesday's Daily. Marie Buncombe, a student from \\ ashing
ton, D.C., related her problems in finding a place to live off cam
pus. She was told by many renters that they will not permit Negroes
to live in their establishments.
The Stanford Administration is aware that some people in the
Stanford area are discriminating against Stanford students. It does
not condone such discrimination and is. as a matter of fact, si ronglv
opposed to it. The I niversitv is at present unable to do much about
this situation, however, according to Dean of Students Donald H.
\\ inbigler.
The reason is that the manpower does not exist to look into all
the cases of discrimination. The Housing Office is composed of two
part-time workers. Dean \\ inbigler estimates that four full-time
workers are expensive and so far the University has not been en
tirely willing to hire them.
The reason is that the University is not sure a Housing Office
is even needed. People who wish to rent could use newspaper ad
vertising and students would not suffer since they could turn to
their newspapers for information instead of to the Housing Office.
At present, Stanford does not list the names of people who
specify tbat they are prejudiced. However, many do not specify.
When the University discovers that some person on the Housing
list is discriminating, then it removes the name. This does not
solve the problem in its entirety, however.
If Ilie Housing Office is not closed and if its staff is not in
creased, then what other alternatives exist? One possible solution
is that a student police force be formed which looks into all mat
ters of discrimination. This has been done at Harvard with some
success. This police force would be informed by people who had
been discriminated against. Tliev would then contact the discrimi
nator and if they discovered that there is no apparent reason for
such discrimination oilier than prejudice, then this person is re
moved from the Housing li*t.
In this manner, students who would not expect nor want any
remuneration could effectively contain discriminatory practices.
Of course, they are not effectively containing discrimination.
Prejudiced individuals will undoubtedly go right on being prej
udiced. However, it is also conceivable that this police force could
contact the many non-discriminating people in the neighborhood
who could ostracize the discriminator. Social pressure is always
an effective weapon.
More importantly, however, this police force could attempt to
educate prejudiced individuals. Few people are so prejudiced that
they cannot be taught. By destroying ignorance one destroys prej
udice and the purpose of any great academic institution is to de
stroy both ignorance and prejudice.
Therefore, if the University is unable to lake up this task,
then perhaps students can and will. Dean inbigler is working
hard and long 011 the problem, but he is only one man with many
other tasks. Perhaps students can give him some assistance. The
Daily would appreciate any suggestions \ou may have.

of them are prejudiced. Some Stanford students wlio are members
of minority groups have discovered this all too often.
In Tuesday's Daily. Marie Buncombe, a student from \\ ashing
ton, D.C., related her problems in finding a place to live off cam
pus. She was told by many renters that they will not permit Negroes
to live in their establishments.
The Stanford Administration is aware that some people in the
Stanford area are discriminating against Stanford students. It does
not condone such discrimination and is. as a matter of fact, si ronglv
opposed to it. The I niversitv is at present unable to do much about
this situation, however, according to Dean of Students Donald H.
\\ inbigler.
The reason is that the manpower does not exist to look into all
the cases of discrimination. The Housing Office is composed of two
part-time workers. Dean \\ inbigler estimates that four full-time
workers are expensive and so far the University has not been en
tirely willing to hire them.
The reason is that the University is not sure a Housing Office
is even needed. People who wish to rent could use newspaper ad
vertising and students would not suffer since they could turn to
their newspapers for information instead of to the Housing Office.
At present, Stanford does not list the names of people who
specify tbat they are prejudiced. However, many do not specify.
When the University discovers that some person on the Housing
list is discriminating, then it removes the name. This does not
solve the problem in its entirety, however.
If Ilie Housing Office is not closed and if its staff is not in
creased, then what other alternatives exist? One possible solution
is that a student police force be formed which looks into all mat
ters of discrimination. This has been done at Harvard with some
success. This police force would be informed by people who had
been discriminated against. Tliev would then contact the discrimi
nator and if they discovered that there is no apparent reason for
such discrimination oilier than prejudice, then this person is re
moved from the Housing li*t.
In this manner, students who would not expect nor want any
remuneration could effectively contain discriminatory practices.
Of course, they are not effectively containing discrimination.
Prejudiced individuals will undoubtedly go right on being prej
udiced. However, it is also conceivable that this police force could
contact the many non-discriminating people in the neighborhood
who could ostracize the discriminator. Social pressure is always
an effective weapon.
More importantly, however, this police force could attempt to
educate prejudiced individuals. Few people are so prejudiced that
they cannot be taught. By destroying ignorance one destroys prej
udice and the purpose of any great academic institution is to de
stroy both ignorance and prejudice.
Therefore, if the University is unable to lake up this task,
then perhaps students can and will. Dean inbigler is working
hard and long 011 the problem, but he is only one man with many
other tasks. Perhaps students can give him some assistance. The
Daily would appreciate any suggestions \ou may have.
Prejudice is an outgrowth of fear and fear is an outgrowth of
ignorance. One benefit gained from attending Stanford I niversity
or any other great academic institution is that students grow out
of their ignorance and therefore their prejudices.
Unfortunately, the same can not he said of people who live
around Stanford. Many of them are ignorant and therefore many
of them are prejudiced. Some Stanford students wlio are members
of minority groups have discovered this all too often.
