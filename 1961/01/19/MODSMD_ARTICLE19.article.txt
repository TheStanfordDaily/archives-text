For some time the Roger Wil-
I liams Fellowship of Stanford-
Palo Alto has been concerned with
'the problem of discrimination in
! off-campus housing and we are
only too aware of the difficulties
some students have experienced.
We have presented the Univer
sity with a resolution advocating
that it adopt and enforce a non
discriminatory policy in regard to
student off-campus housing and
have discussed the matter with
the Dean of Students, Dr. Win
bigler. The University IS con
cerned, and Dr. Winbigler has
spent a great deal ol' his time on
this problem.
The main stumbling block to
proceeding with a non-discrimina
tory policy is adequate means of
enforcement. The staff in the
Housing Office consists of two
persons who must spend most of
their time arranging dormitory
i housing.
One person works on off-cam-
I pus housing part time. In addi
tion, off-campus housing is viewed
by the University as a temporary
measure. The University is there
fore in no position to investigate
and enforce such a non-discrimi
natory housing policy at the pres
ent time.
Other institutions that have an
nounced such policies and en
forced them have also had the
backing of city licensing proced-'

ures which do not exist at present
in Palo Alto and surrounding
communities.
Nevertheless Ihe University is
actively working toward a practi
cal solution. Various civic groups
in Palo Alto are also pursuing
open housing campaigns and can
assist persons who suffer discrim
ination. Roger Williams Fellow
ship thought it wise to inform the
Stanford student body of what
steps are being taken and where
the main concerns lie.
The most effective action that
can be undertaken by students at
present is to report any evidence
of discrimination to the Housing
Office or the dean.

Much has been said recently
about the lIUAC film, committee
mooting in San Francisco, and the
ensuing riot. I was not here at
the time, but from what I have
heard and read. I have come to
several conclusions.
The functions of the HUAC
should be to reveal Communist
activities in front organizations
and in various other situations
such as riots. The functions
should not be to smear certain in
dividuals or organizations when
they are being investigated.
The investigators should use

discrimination in giving out in
formation lo the press especially
if it floes not suit its functions.
Since the Communist Party seeks
to destroy our nation in any way
possible, a committee such as the
HIJAC is necessary in order to
present the inner workings of the
Communist Party to the public to
show them what the Communists
are doing in our nation.

If the committee investigations
had been carried out in the right
manner, there would not have
been any riot to protest against
their methods. The only bad re
sult from these investigations
would he the tendency to push
the Communists further under
ground and hamper FBI counter
espionage work.
