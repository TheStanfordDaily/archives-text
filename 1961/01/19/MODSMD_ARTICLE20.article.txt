About six weeks ago the representatives of the athletic depart
ments of several Bay Area colleges and universities got together
with some local sports writers for a general discussion of some of the
problems being faced by college athletics.
Pete Newell, athletic director at the University of California, was
one of those present who was most disturbed about the future of
college athletics and what ho considered to be hasty and unfair treat
ment of this subject in the press.
The San Francisco Chronicle asked Newell to write an article
giving his views. Somewhat later, Dr. Fric A. Walker, president of
lVnn State University, delivered a speech before the meeting of the
American Football Coaches Association in Pittsburgh. Dr. Walker
flatly predicted the end of high-level intercollegiate athletics because
of the pressure of high admission standards and the competition
from professional sports.
Whether Dr. Walker's speech aroused Newell to accept the Chron
icle's invitation to write an article or whether Newell had been work
ing on it anyway, Iho article, which appeared in Tuesday's
Chronicle, is an important statement on the future of big-time college
athletics at Cal and throughout Ihe United States. Naturally Newell
disagrees with Dr. Walker.
Basically Xewell's argument is twofold: One part is a question
of semantics while the other concerns the basic problem facing col
lege sports today: Can big-time college athletics continue in the face
of the rising demand for academic excellence?
A Question of Meanings
The semantics problem, as Newell sees it. is ihe use of the word
"de-emphasis." lie doesn't like the way it is thrown about today.
Newell says:
"There's nothing wrong with the word or its implications when
properly applied. When it's mis-used, though, simply as a vague
catch-all description, or used before the fact to label the quality of
an athletic program or describe its policy, it can be .seriously mis
leading."
Of course, a similar statement can be applied to the usage of
many words today, in athletics and out. We love labels. They make
things easy by conjuring up a ready-made image of something
vaguely related to the thing being talked about. And if the ready
made image is only partially correct or even altogether misleading,
at least it serves the purpose of getting us through the discussion of
whatever it is we're talking about without doing any real thinking.
Thus, if Marquette drops football altogether (we'll stay in the
realm of sports, you can supply your own examples from other sub
jects) and COP starts playing against smaller schools and Cal hires
a coach who has a Phi Beta Kappa key. the label-user hollers "de
emphasis" at all of them and lets it go at that. Newell says this isn't
fair and lie's right. Actually, we think the word has lost any of the
moaning it might have ever had and it ought to be dropped in favor
of specific phrases for specific situations.
Athletics vs. Academies
Now for Newell's thinking on what is, as we have said, Ihe most
important problem facing high-level intercollegiate competition. Can
big-time athletics square with the growing demand for big-time aca
demics? His statement on this subject is the best thing we have seen
on the subject. To quote at length:
"In summarizing California's athletic position I would like to pin
point one recent statement by a columnist:
" "It could lie the Bears and Indians have grown weak ahead of
the pack because they elected to be among the first to enforce rules
and standards with which nearly all will be required to comply in
the next ten years.'
"We don't think the enforcement of rules and standards means
weaknesses- -decreasingly so, as it is meant by the columnist, as
others follow. Here is exactly what we do believe:
"We're proud of our high athletic standards and the place of in
tercollegiate athletics at California in the total University picture and
within the framework of total educational objectives.
"Far from being headed toward de-emphasis, we are taking the
lead in what we believe to be an ever-increasing trend in this direction
everywhere in collegiate athletics.
"We feel further that high school standards are being raised, and
will be increasingly, to provide a greater percentage of students (in
cluding athletes eligible for university admission, thus strengthen
ing our intercollegiate sports program. In other words, there is a
parallel trend taking place in our high schools which will more and
more demand higher levels of scholastic accomplishment in order to
participate in athletics. Where this trend is not yet apparent, we be
lieve it will be very soon.
"Finally, what we believe to be in the future nationally — a sta
bilization of athletic sind educational objectives similar to our own —
does not imply in any sense a decline in interest in collegiate com
petition including football. Rather, because it will be devoid of the
hypocrisy now prevalent, intercollegiate athletics should have greater
appeal than ever."
To all of this we can only add. amen. High schools are getting
better throughout the nation (Sputnik be praised). Most colleges are
increasing their admission requirements. The day of the meathead
football player is rapidly coming to an etui and the day of the student
football player, who wants to go to the best school he can, is ap
proaching.
One more thing. The fact that Newell and others, such as the
powers-that-be at Stanford, are doing some deep thinking along this
line Assistant Athletic Director Chuck Taylor is concerned in much
the same way is a good sign. It was getting pretty discouraging
listening to all those knuckleheads- mostly students, alumni and
sportswriters who get so emotional whenever anyone dares to sug
gest that there might bo something wrong with college athletics or
that something ought to be done to solve some of its problems.
There is plenty wrong with collegiate sports and the Don't Talk
About It and It Will Go Away boys do their cause a disservice by
their attitude.
