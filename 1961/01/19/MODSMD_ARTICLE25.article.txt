# Cagers to Host Washington Five
## 
### KEN DERY 
Stanford's improving basketball team plays host to the Washing
ion Huskies twice this weekend, Friday and Saturday nights, at the
Pavilion.
The Huskies, with a 1-3 conference record, will have to win both
games in order to keep alive any championship hopes.
Stanford, on the other hand, has only played one game in league

competition and victories would
put Coach Howie Dallmar's boys
into contention.
COACH John Grayson's charges
were bopped twice last weekend
by league-leading Southern Cali
fornia, after splitting two confer
ence openers with UCLA.
Washington was given an out
side chance in the Big Five race
at the beginning of the season for
the team has strong personnel.
CENTER Bill Hanson, who
picked up 38 points in the losing
efforts with Southern Cal, is the
team's leading scorer.
With 11 games under his bolt,
the 6-8 junior from Mercer Island
has tallied 153 points, good for a
13.9 average.
Clint Names, a sharp-shooting
guard, is next on the point pro
duction list with a 12.7 average.
Grayson commented after the
Trojan series that he was satis
fied with his team's overall effort,
although he still was looking for
more help from the reserves.
lIK DID HAVE high praise for
forward Ed Corell, a 6-6 sopho
more, who was a starter last Fri
day for the first time.
Corell hit 6 of 10 shots from the
field and snatched 14 rebounds to
lead both teams in total rebounds
the first night. In Saturday's ac
tion ho hit 6 of 8 fielders in total
ing 14 points.
The other starters will bo Roger
Niva, 6-6 junior forward from
Seattle and Earle Irvine, a 6-4 sen
ior guard.
IRVINE has just recently be
come a starter and Niva has al
ways been rough and ready on the
boards.
Last season Niva was a key
factor although he didn't receive
much of the publicity. When the
stocky forward has one of his
good scoring nights the Husky at
tack is very well balanced indeed.
With Hanson up front Wash
ington is always a tough op
ponent. but the youngster has
also shown a tendency for fouling.
