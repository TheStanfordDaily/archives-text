# Business Students Hear Plinton on Nigeria
## 
### 
Nigeria — prosperous, sober land of potential leadership for
Africa, was the picture of Africa's second newest nation drawn by
James Plinton Tuesday night.
Plinton of TWA flew out to Stanford from New York to talk with
business students who hope to participate in the Stanford Inter-

national Business Club's summer
project in Nigeria.
Drawing upon his experiences
during his recent visit to Nigeria
where he was hosted by his Lin
coln College classmate, the Gover
nor of Nigeria, Plinton told of the
high degree of integrity and rea
sonableness found in the Niger
ians. "These two qualities com
bined with a fairly stable govern
ment make Nigeria an excellent
investment area."
"NIGERIA, possibly more than
the United States, was ready for
her independence when she re
ceived it last Oct. 1," Plinton
stated. "She has been preparing i
40 years for independence and
the wisdom of the present govern
ment reflects this preparation."
"Opposition is encouraged in
Nigeria, for the government rea-1
lizes the value of criticism." Plin-!
ton remarked, emphasizing the
Nigerians' strong desire for per
sonal 112 reedo m. "Communism
hasn't a chance at the present
lime, because of the lack of mal
content in the country."
PLINTON pointed out the mis
conception most Americans have
of the "savage brush" in a place
such as Nigeria. "In Nigeria the
savage brush consists of three
story stucco houses where the
natives eat off of sterling silver."
Although he praised Nigeria
heartily, Plinton also admitted il
has its faults. "It's strength, how
ever, lies in the fact that the peo
ple recognize the existing faults
and are anxious to do something
about them they know they lack
technical knowledge and are anx
ious to get all the help they can to
improve this situation."
