## Eisenhower Favors Three-Nation Board 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI ) —President Eisenhower said yesterday re
vival of a three-nation commission might be the best means of
settling the Laotian civil war. He temporarily rejected the idea of
calling a major international conference to discuss the problem.
At his news conference, the President said it might, be useful to

| re-establish the commission com
' posed of India, Canada and Po
land. which was set up in 1954 to
police the Indochinese truce giv
ing independence to Laos.
The commission later was dis
banded at Laotian insistence.
As an alternative, Cambodia
i has proposed convening of a 14-
nation conference to try to settle
I the Laotian war being fought be
| tween pro-Western and pro-Com-
I munist forces. The U.S. reply to
this has been relayed to Cambo
dian Prime Minister Norodom
Sihanouk by Eisenhower, the
! State Department said yesterday.
HIGH OFFIC lAL sources said
| the United States did not consider
i such a multi-nation conference
feasible at this particular time.
The Cambodian proposal called
! for a meeting of all the nations
represented at the 1954 Geneva
i Conference on Indochina, plus the
! members of the Control Commis
sion, and plus the United States
and Laos' neighbors.
The conferees thus would in
clude the United States. Britain.
I Russia, Communist China, France,
1 Canada, Poland, India, Burma,
Laos, North Vietnam, South Viet
nam, Thailand and Cambodia.
By not rejecting the Cambodian
i suggestion outright, Eisenhower
left room for maneuver by the in
coming Kennedy administration.
THE PRESIDENT said at his
news conference that "there is no
point of going into a conference
unless everybody thinks this
would be a good idea."
; Instead, he said reconvening of
Iho Control Commission might
be useful provided it were done
l "in proper auspices."
The major problem, as the Pros-
I ident indicated, is getting the
I Communist bloc to recognize t lie?
| legitimacy of the pro-American
j government of Prince Bourn Oum.
In the U.S. view, Boum Oum's
government is the legal one in
Laos because it has been recog
• nized by the King and approved
by Parliament.
THE RUSSIANS, however, re
! gard Boum Oum's government as
i illegal and maintain it was in
! stalled by Parliament under du
ress. If the Soviets did recognize
Boum Oum's regime, they would
; have an immense problem trying
to justify continued arms ship
ments to pro-Communist rebels
who are fighting the Vientiane
1 government.
