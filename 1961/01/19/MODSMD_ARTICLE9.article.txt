# Southern Cal Alumni Grow
## 
### 
Southern California, home of
35 per cent of Stanford's total
9100 students and 26 per cent of
her alumni, is hosting two Stan
ford meetings today.
The University's Board of Trus
tees is holding the second meeting
in its history in Los Angeles with
a press conference by Pres. J. E.
Wallace Sterling and Board Presi
dent Thomas Pike to follow.
The board of governors of Stan
ford Associates, a group formed
in 1934 to help promote the Uni
versity's welfare, will be meeting
simultaneously in the city.
Southern California is seizing
control with good reason: of all
students from California (55 per
cent of the undergraduates), 64
per cent are from ten counties
surrounding Los Angeles, with 42
per cent of this 64 from the city
itself.
Also, 36 per cent of last year's
undergraduate scholarships were
won by residents of that area, and
11 per cent of all Stanford's gift
funds come from them even
counting contributions from big
Eastern foundations.
