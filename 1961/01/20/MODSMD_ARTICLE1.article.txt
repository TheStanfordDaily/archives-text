# Congressional Bogdown for Project 'M'?
## Still 'Just a Proposal' Says Rep. Holifield 
### MAYNARD PARKER Managing Editor 
Project M is still very far from
becoming a l-eality. Rep. Cliet
Holifield (D-Cal.), set to become
chairman of the Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy, said yesterday
in a telephone interview from
Washington.
"It is, after all, just a proposal
by the Stanford people," lie said.
Hi: RKFUSKI) to comment on
whether the legislation will meet
stormy waters before the commit
tee or whether it would even get
to the floor of the House.
"It would be very foolish for
me to predict the course of legis
lation before the Joint Committee
is even organized," he commented.
Holifield himself is witholding
judgment on the linear electron
accelerator.
"1 haven't made up my mind.
At the hearings we will give an
ample opportunity for the Stan
ford people to state their case.
Our staff will study the testimony
and other witnesses who agree or
disagree with the proposal will
speak."
THK XKXT hearing is sched
uled for March or April in Wash
ington.
He did acknowledge that the
one hearing held thus far showed
p r o p o n e n t s had been "inade
quately prepared." The new hear
ings, he stated, would "do a
thorough job."

"It costs $125-155 million plus
an annual operational estimate of
$30 million — it's a substantial
matter and not one to make a
snap decision on," he explained.
"The committee last year au
thorized a three-million-dollar
study and it would be foolish to
make a decision without studying
this report."
THE MONEY from this grant
will run out sometime in March
or April.

Atomic Energy Commission, John
A. McCone, favored the project
