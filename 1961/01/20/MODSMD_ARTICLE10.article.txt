# TRISKA, NORTH SPEAK
## Power Has Weakened Reds,' Say SU Profs 
### JEAN EBERHART 
"The success of the U.S.S.R., which seemed absolute ten years ago,
seems uncertain today," claimed Prof. Jan F. Triska in a discussion
of "Communism and Power" last night in the Women's Clubhouse.
Trouble is ahead for the Chinese also according to Prof. Robert C.
North, co-director with Triska of a five-year "Conflict Studies" re

search project, but North feels
that this trouble has yet to take
definite form.
The two Russian experts dis
cussed the corrupting effect of
power on communism as part of
llR's Soviet Studies program.
TRISKA contended that the
great success of the Soviet or
ganization is capable of breaking
up the Soviet bloc because this
power is now almost uncontrolla
ble. The Soviet Union may have
already passed the organizational
level due to its unprecedented in
crease in size in the past 35 years.
"The undisputed rule of the So
viet Communist Party over other
Communist parties is over," Tris
ka declared, "and the Russians
are aware of their weakness." He
believes they are loosening their
organization as much as possible
to meet existing needs.
"Preservation of security is a
national goal," North remarked.
"The Chinese are capable of shift
ing their goals and means to pre
serve their security."
EVEN THOUGH the Chinese
have obtained power, North feels
that the population explosion is a
challenge which the Chinese as of
yet have no way to meet. On the
other hand, the Soviet Union is
faced with a manpower shortage.
North feels that the cohesive
force of population determines to
a large extent the power of a na
tion. He stated that the great
strength of the Chinese came
when the Communists "gathered
up the frustrations of Hie people
and turned them to satisfactions."
North concluded that the chal
lenge facing the Communist
power system in the next few
decades is the difficulty that the
Chinese and Russians will have
in articulating their needs and
problems.
