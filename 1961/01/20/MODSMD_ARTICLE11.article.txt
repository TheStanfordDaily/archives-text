### 
A former Cal student was ar
rested yesterday as tlie man who
blasted a graduate student to
death and critically wounded an
English professor Wednesday af
ternoon in Dwindle Hall on the
Berkeley campus.
John Harrison Farmer, 34, of
Oakland, was found wandering in
the Berkeley hills carrying a shot
gun and hunting knife by the po
lice. He admitted the shooting,
saying first "God told me to do
it." but later that he had "no
good reason" but was "against
communism."
Farmer's still-living victim,
Prof. Thomas F. Parkinson, was
shot first and part of his jaw
was lipped off. "I passed Prof.
Parkinson's door, saw it ajar,
came back and started shooting,"
Farmer told Cal police. Graduate
student Stephen M. Thomas, in
the office, made a move toward
Farmer, who fired again, hitting
Thomas in the back. Thomas, an
outstanding student working to
ward a philosophy doctorate, died
a few hours later.
Farmer said he had taken a
course from Parkinson while a
Cal undergrad, "but didn't really
know him and had nothing
against him."
Parkinson had recently been a
critic of the HCUA, had opposed
compulsory military training for
undergraduates and has been a
member of SLATE, a campus po
litical organization, campus police
said.
