# Washington Snowfall Snarls Traffic, Inauguration Plans
## Traditional Festivities Disrupted 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) John F.
Kennedy takes the oath as the na
tion's 35th President today in a
Capital city all but paralyzed on
| Inaugural Eve by a driving snow
storm that wrecked some festivi
ties and disrupted the plans ot
ex-presidents.
The frenzied capital, jammed
i with visitors for the Inaugural,
; was thoroughly fouled up. Ken-

The inauguration of John F.
Kennedy will be carried locally on
television channels 4, 5, 7 and 11,
starting at 8 a.m. The official
J swearing-in ceremony is slated
i for about 9 a.m.

nedy and his wife, Jacqueline,
were forced to cancel out of sev
eral scheduled events when they
could not make their way through
snow-covered streets.
With the swearing-in only hours
away, the official forecaster pre
dicted the storm would deposit
"up to 6 inches or more" of snow
on the city before tapering off
and ending in the early morning.
Washington Sanitation Director
William A. Xanten enllsd the traf
fic snarl "absolutely hopeless"
and said it was blocking his snow
plows, trucks and sanding equip
ment from clearing the streets for
today's festivities.
FOR TIIK noon swearing-in on
Capitol Hill today, the forecaster
predicted "windy and cold with
variable cloudiness and a high
near 32 degrees." Duiing the
night the temperature dropped to
the low 20's.
Perhaps hardest hit by the
storm was former President and
Stanford graduate Herbert Hoo
ver. He was flown in an Air
Force transport from Miami, Fla.,
to Washington, but the plane was
unable to land in the Capital and
Hoover decided to return to Flor
ida.
He had been scheduled for a
special place of honor in the In
augural ceremonies, along with
the nation's other two ex-presi
dents, Harry S. Truman and
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Until late yesterday, Kennedy
all but ignored the storm as ho
plowed through a crowded sched
ule on his last day before solemn
ly swearing to "preserve, protect
and defend the Constitution of
the United States."
The District of Columbia gov
ernment threw a 2,300-man snow
removal crew into the emergency.
But frustrated officials all but
wept that they could not go to
work until they had hauled stalled
autos off the historic Pennsyl
vania Avenue inaugural parade
route.
