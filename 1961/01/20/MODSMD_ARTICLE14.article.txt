# Misrepresented Again
## 
### 
Yesterday's San Francisco Chronicle carried an editorial about
the future of athletics at Stanford and the University of California.
The editorial is part of the Chronicle's 22nd Public Opinion poll.
Part of the editorial concerns itself with the recent controversy
at Stanford regarding de-emphasis of football. One portion reads:
"Last fall The Stanford Daily suggested that the time had come to
de-emphasize, since Stanford was taking its lumps from schools
that admitted athletes who could never make the grade on the
Farm. Stanford ended the 1960 season with the only unblemished
record in the Hig Five—all losses, no wins—but tlie coaches are
still working and Tlio Stanford Daily"s advice has been (as often)
ignored."
The Daily wishes to state once again that it did not advocate
de-emphasis of football! We simply SUGGESTFD that de-em pha
sis might be necessary. The San Francisco newspapers distorted
our purpose all during the controversy and seem determined to
distort our purpose as long as it suits their purpose . . . whatever
it may he.
To restate The Daily's purpose: w r e question the wisdom of
having "big time football"' at Stanford because over-emphasis of
athletics is perhaps non-essential and even destructive at an insti
tution of higher learning which prides itself or should pride itself
on its victories in the field of education rather than its victories
or attempted victories in the field of athletics.
Dr. James Bryant Con ant, former president of Harvard, wrote
in a recent Look article that he finds a "vicious overemphasis" on
competitive athletics that is "seriously destructive of our entire
educational structure." He feels that the educational values of
senior high schools are being adversely affected. In these days, he
asks, "Can we afford the luxury of so much misdirected effort?"
We do not say that Dr. Conant is right, nor do we say he is
wrong. We do feel, however, that his ideas and the ideas of other
prominent educators should be analyzed for it could very well be
that they ARE right. We suggest that Stanford students acquire
yesterday's Chronicle in order to fill out the poll. The poll directly
affects us, and we should show an interest. The Chronicle is per
forming a valuable service by printing this poll. We only wish it
would stop misrepresenting our purpose.
