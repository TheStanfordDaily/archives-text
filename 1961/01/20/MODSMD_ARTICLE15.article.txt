"Dramatic imagination is the
heart of theater art, but the build
ing is its bone and muscle and
gives expression to its every;
thought and impulse."—ArchLau!

With the "bone and muscle" al-!
ready right on campus in the
form of Dinkelspiel Auditorium, i
there is great encouragement for ;
the thought that Stanford could !
become a vital contributor to 1 he i
theater art of this country.
The evident problem and goal,
then, is to learn to use Dinkelspiel
as a THEATER.
One solution, as suggested in
earlier columns, is to employ a
full-time director who could thor-!
oughly investigate the possibili-j
ties of Dinkelspiel and produce'
several shows there each year.
Lack of finances prevents this '
at the present time, however, and
focuses attention on a second, i
more feasible solution, that of en
couraging the Department of Mu
sic and Department of Speech and
Drama to combine their efforts
at least once a year to produce a
quality show in Dinkelspiel.
Persons connected with both
departments have shown enthu
siasm and willingness to work on
such a joint project while both
departments would have to de- j
crease the number of shows pro- j
duced separately each year, thej
outcome unquestionably would |
give new impetus to drama and |
music at Stanford and, perhaps j
eventually, to drama and music:
in general.
In addition, it would be highly
desirable to set up an experi
mental theater program which
would center around Dinkelspiel.
In such a program, speech and
drama majors concerned with the
technical side of theater would be
encouraged to develop new means
of staging all types of dramatic
works. Student directors and ac
tors would be able to explore and j
work with the latest ideas in
drama — ideas which are being!
carried out now in other parts of j
the country in theaters very simi
lar to Dinkelspiel — and perhaps}
develop new ones.
But there are several crucial
problems attached to this idea.
The first and most important is
tiie problem of space. It would be

practically useless to institute an
experimental theater program un
less actual shows could be pre
sented. And this would most
likely require evening- rehearsal
time in addition to times for the
performances.
While most of the lectures
which are given in Dinkelspiel
now could be moved lo other loca
tions, Music Department projects,
such as the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra, require the stage area
for rehearsals.
As of now the Music and Drama
Departments have two separate
programs, and"the physical fa
cilities are inadequate" for both,
according to Norman D. Phil
brick, executive head of the De
partment of Speech and Drama.
An experimental theater pro
gram is in the planning stage
which could include a repertory
company and guest artists and
also promote better communica
tion between educational and pro
fessional theater, he said.
This program would be facili
tated by the proposed Fine Arts
Center which is scheduled to be
built near Dinkelspiel sometime
within the next ten years. This
will include another auditorium
with a seating capacity of from
600 to 800 persons and facilities
for either proscenium or circle
staging of shows and adequate
rehearsal rooms.
But ten years is too long 1 to
wait. By that time, Dinkelspiel,
now one of the most progressive
theater buildings in the country,
would bo unable to emerge as a
working and leading example of
American theater.
It would take extremely close
cooperation between all concerned
—the Departments of Music and
Speech and Drama and the Uni
versity as a whole—to work out
any sort of experimental program
in Dinkelspiel NOW. But it could
be done.
At least the Departments of Mu
sic and Speech and Drama could
get together once a year and work
on the problem by producing a
show which would combine both
music and drama in Dinkelspiel.
For this is the only possible,
current solution to the problem of
a magnificent—but ignored —the-
ater.
