Editor, the Daily:
Since last week's movie and de
bate on the House Committee on
Un-American Activities, I've read
letters in almost every issue of
the Daily concerning the dispute.
But I've looked unsuccessfully,
both during the meeting and aft
erward, for an indication of con
structive purpose beyond the im
mediate controversy.
The students came to the meet
ing with a variety of attitudes.
But the most apparent because
its proponents were the loudest—
was one of predetermined preju
dice against the committee and
disdain of the film and its sup
porters.
I. like a number of others, came
with no clear opinions, but with
a desire to see the film for my
self, hear the arguments on both
sides, and evenlually emerge with
some basis for valid judgment.
I left with a variety of new
ideas. What impressed me mo-st
was the difficulty of dredging
from all the emotion, evasion,
and manipulation of words, some
thing solid enough that I could
say of it:"I believe this is true."
I finally decided (tentatively)
that I was against the HCUA be
cause it was:
1) Probably unconstitutional,
and certainly hypocritical in its
manifest purpose and methods,
and
2) Ineffectual in combatting
Communism, and, in fart, seeming
to provide a favorable field for
Communist sideshows.
On the other hand, I felt that
the film's assertion the student
demonstrations last May had been
Communist encouraged and led,
and that even those well-meaning
demonstrators who were merely
voicing a valid protest against
HCUA contributed inadvertently
to Communist propaganda goals,
was largely true.
"Unsuspecting dupes" was the
oft-repeated phrase used by the
HCUA supporters,and its connota
tion as they used it may be mis
leading. What I'm saying is that
I believe Communist agitators
(witness the ranting Archie
Brown) were on the scene to take
full advantage of the occasion,
and the demonstrators, whether
with good or bad intentions, with
intelligent or ignorant attitudes,
employing peaceable or violent
means, contributed to propaganda
gains made by the Communists in
San Francisco last May.
In any dispute, especially in a
dispute with such significant im
plications as this one, a person
who takes a firm stand must do so
with a definite purpose in mind.
Good intentions are not enough.
Mere opposition lo an existing in

| stitution is not enough. Theoret
j ically we are concerned with this
i problem because we are concerned
iwith the securing of peace, the
«
i improvement of the human condi
j tion everywhere, and the welfare
of our nation as it contributes to
; these ends.
The HCUA was meant to do a
job. It seems to have failed. Its
mere abolishment, although it
may be desirable, will not get that
! job done. The real challenge is in
| the formulation of an intelligent,
imaginative and const ructive
course of action that WILL got
I the job done. But none of the
principal speakers in this contro
versy seem too concerned with
[ that problem.
j I ask you, Barry Greenberg of
The Stanford Daily; I ask you,
i Prof. Searle of the Berkeley fac
ulty; and I ask you, the Stanford
| students who scorned, hissed, and
[ridiculed the HCUA and its pro
| ponents: can you see far enough
j beyond your holy crusade against
a group of legislators (who, like
■ you, are well-meaning) to propose
'constructive measures for peace,
enlightenment, and human dig
nity?

Editor, The Daily:
In his letter of Jan. 16, Mena
hem K. Yaari defended the rights
j of the State of Israel to try
Adolph Eichmann: "Eichmann is
placed on trial in Israel precisely
■ because Rabbi Berger and others
. like him did nothing to place him
' on trial elsewhere."
Yet what right has Israel to try
, Eichmann? What right has the
; Israeli underground to kidnap an
' Argentine citizen, .smuggle him
; outside the confines of his own
j country, and transport him to
; Israel for crimes which were com
mitted in a third country? We fail
j to see why Israel has any more
! right under international law to
! do this than Khrushchev's NKVD

or Castro's secrot police would
have to kidnap an AmeiMcan citi
zen, smuggle him out of the
United States, and take him to
Russia or Cuba for a mock trial.
Furthermore, why should Eich-
I mann be tried before an Israeli
! court instead of an international
court of justice as were all other
German prisoners who were ac
cused of having committed war
crimes? The underlying concept
| of jurisprudence stipulates that a
| person accused of criminal act-s
i be tried by an unbiased judge and
jury. If either a judge or a jury
member feels that his prediposi
tions would prejudice his opinion,
he is bound by honor —if not by
law to relinquish his position to
an impartial person. However, the
possibility of obtaining an impar
tial judge and jury in Israel is, at
best remote.
Finally, if all lawbreakers in
volved in the Eichmann case are
to be punished, why shouldn't the
underground agents who took
Eichmann to Israel be treated in
the same way as any other kid
nappers; i.e. returned to Argen
tina to stand trial for the crime
of abducting an Argentine citi
zen?
