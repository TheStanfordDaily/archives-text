HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?
Todnv lot us address ourselves ton question that has long rocked
and roiled the academic world: Is a student hotter olY at a
small college than at a large college?
To answer this question it is necessary first to define terms.
What, exactly, do wo mean by a small college? Well sir, some say
that in order to be called truly small, a college should have uu
enrollment of not more than four students.
I certainly have no quarrel with this statement; a four
student college must unquestionably be called small. Indeed,
one could even call it in time ii' one knew what intimi meant.
Hut I submit there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for
instance, a recent unfortunate occurrence at ('rimscott A and M.
Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled
between Denver and Baltimore, was founded by A. and M.
Crimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 17()(i tit escape the
potato famine of 1841. As a result of their foresight, the Crim
scott brothers never went without potatoes for one single day of
their lives—and mighty grateful they were! One night, full of
gratitude after a hearty meal of French fries, cottage fries, hash
browns, and ail sratin, they decided to show their appreciation
to this bountiful land of potatoes by endowing a college. They
stipulated that enrollment should never exceed four students
because they felt that only by keeping the college this small

'—. 7 r
could each student bo assured of the personalized attention, the
camaraderie, the feeling of belonging, that is all too often lacking
in higher education.
Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday a
few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football was,
of course, something of a problem at Crimscott, what with only
four students enrolled in the entire college. Tt was easy enough
to muster a backficld, but finding a good line—or even a bad
line—baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country.
Well sir, fin the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its traditional rival, a capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow- in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with the breakbone fever. Wriehards, the
slotback, was unable to start his motorcycle. Reerbohm-Tree,
the wingback-tailback, got his necktie caught in his espresso
machine. Langerhans, the fullback, was stolen by gypsies.
Consequently, alas, none of the Crimscott team showed up at
the game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to score
almost at will. ('riinscott was so out of sorts that they immedi
ately broke off football relations with Minnesota, its traditional
rival. This later became known as the Dred Scott Decision.
So you can see how only four students might be too small an
enrollment. The number 1 personally favor is twenty. How
come? Because when you have twenty students and one of
them opens a pack of Marlboro ('igarettes, there are enough to
go around for everybody, and no one has to he deprived of
Marlboro's fine, mild flavor, of Marlboro's easy-drawing filter,
of Marlboro's joy and zest and steadfast companionship, and
as a result you have a student body that is filled with sweet
content and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness
and soft pack and flip-top box.
That's how come. ®imi m«> shuimt*

You trill also find twenty cigarettes—twenty incomparable
unfiltered king-size cigarettes—in each pack of Marlbttro's
new partner in pleasure—the t'hilip Morris Commander.

HOW SMALL CAN YOU GET?
Todnv lot us address ourselves ton question that has long rocked
and roiled the academic world: Is a student hotter olY at a
small college than at a large college?
To answer this question it is necessary first to define terms.
What, exactly, do wo mean by a small college? Well sir, some say
that in order to be called truly small, a college should have uu
enrollment of not more than four students.
I certainly have no quarrel with this statement; a four
student college must unquestionably be called small. Indeed,
one could even call it in time ii' one knew what intimi meant.
Hut I submit there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for
instance, a recent unfortunate occurrence at ('rimscott A and M.
Crimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled
between Denver and Baltimore, was founded by A. and M.
Crimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 17()(i tit escape the
potato famine of 1841. As a result of their foresight, the Crim
scott brothers never went without potatoes for one single day of
their lives—and mighty grateful they were! One night, full of
gratitude after a hearty meal of French fries, cottage fries, hash
browns, and ail sratin, they decided to show their appreciation
to this bountiful land of potatoes by endowing a college. They
stipulated that enrollment should never exceed four students
because they felt that only by keeping the college this small

'—. 7 r
could each student bo assured of the personalized attention, the
camaraderie, the feeling of belonging, that is all too often lacking
in higher education.
Well sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday a
few years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game
scheduled against Minnesota, its traditional rival. Football was,
of course, something of a problem at Crimscott, what with only
four students enrolled in the entire college. Tt was easy enough
to muster a backficld, but finding a good line—or even a bad
line—baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country.
Well sir, fin the morning of the big game against Minnesota,
its traditional rival, a capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel
blow- in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,
woke up that morning with the breakbone fever. Wriehards, the
slotback, was unable to start his motorcycle. Reerbohm-Tree,
the wingback-tailback, got his necktie caught in his espresso
machine. Langerhans, the fullback, was stolen by gypsies.
Consequently, alas, none of the Crimscott team showed up at
the game, and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to score
almost at will. ('riinscott was so out of sorts that they immedi
ately broke off football relations with Minnesota, its traditional
rival. This later became known as the Dred Scott Decision.
So you can see how only four students might be too small an
enrollment. The number 1 personally favor is twenty. How
come? Because when you have twenty students and one of
them opens a pack of Marlboro ('igarettes, there are enough to
go around for everybody, and no one has to he deprived of
Marlboro's fine, mild flavor, of Marlboro's easy-drawing filter,
of Marlboro's joy and zest and steadfast companionship, and
as a result you have a student body that is filled with sweet
content and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness
