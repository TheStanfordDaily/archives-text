# WASHINGTON POSES HOOP THREAT
## Cards, Huskies Vie in Pavilion Tonight 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Here's something new: Fifteen Seatllites hope to launch some
aerials of their own at the Stanford Pavilion tonight. The Seattlites
are, of course, members of the visiting University of Washington
basketball team, Stanford's foe for two weekend hoop frays.
Although the Huskies won't send anything into orbit, their throws
to the ten-foot level will be most

important to Indian m en to r
Howie Dallmar, the Farm five and
some 2,700 home court fans.
A TEAM'S second league game
of the season shouldn't be called
a make-or-break affair but this
encounter, Stanford's second
AAWU outing, might well decide
Ihe local's title chances.
Stanford started the season
slowly, then won four of their
last six and moved into a dark
horse role in the Big Five race,
right now holding down second
spot on the strength of a win over
Cal.
WASHINGTON, on the other
hand, was once boosted as a con
tender and then quickly cooled
off. The second best offense in the
AAWU and the second worst
league standing is the paradoxial
record that the Huskies bring into
tonight's encounter; Washington
has averaged 61 points per game
in AAWU play but at the same
time they have won only one
while losing three.
Actually the northlanders have
talent enough for a winning sea
son- they have a starting front
line that averages 6-6 and ac
curate, balanced shooting from
the floor. Bill Hanson, 6-8 Wash
ington center, has the third best
scoring average in the circuit, hit
ting 16.5 counters per game and
he has twined over half of his
fielder attempts. Clint Names,
veteran guard, has added another
12.5 points and has hit nearly half
of his shots.
TIIK ONLY trouble is a lack of

rebounding- the Huskies are last
in this respect and the fact that
the Seattle residents had the mis
fortune of playing UCLA and
USC, the two toughest squads in
the Big Five, in their first four
games.
Stanford, on the other hand, is
relatively untested. The Card's
only win was over cellar-dwelling
Cal and the Bears have been
beaten in all of their regular
starts. Tonight will be Dallmar's
crew's first real 1 ague test.
John Windsor ~nd John Hendry
should provide plenty of offensive
punch for the Indians. Windsor
has averaged more than 14 points
per start through 12 games of the
current campaign and Hendry has
come along fast, scoring 49 points
in the last three games.
KKY TO A Card win will be the
ability of pivotmen Rich Hosley
and Mike Ledgerwood to match
the efforts of Hanson. Together
the Stanford centers have man
aged less than half of the Wash
ington star's output and Ed Corell,
6-6 forward for the invaders, has
been more effective on the boards
than either of the Farm big men.
Senior Bub Bowling and sopho
more Don Clemetson will get the
call for most of the Card's back
court duty. Bowling scored 11
points against California and has
the third highest Stanford offens
ive average. Clemetson showed a
good eye against Oregon, chalk
ing up 16 counters in one of the
teams' two meetings.

right now holding down second
spot on the strength of a win over
Cal.
WASHINGTON, on the other
hand, was once boosted as a con
tender and then quickly cooled
off. The second best offense in the
AAWU and the second worst
league standing is the paradoxial
record that the Huskies bring into
tonight's encounter; Washington
has averaged 61 points per game
in AAWU play but at the same
time they have won only one
while losing three.
Actually the northlanders have
talent enough for a winning sea
son- they have a starting front
line that averages 6-6 and ac
curate, balanced shooting from
the floor. Bill Hanson, 6-8 Wash
ington center, has the third best
scoring average in the circuit, hit
ting 16.5 counters per game and
he has twined over half of his
fielder attempts. Clint Names,
veteran guard, has added another
12.5 points and has hit nearly half
of his shots.
TIIK ONLY trouble is a lack of

rebounding- the Huskies are last
in this respect and the fact that
the Seattle residents had the mis
fortune of playing UCLA and
USC, the two toughest squads in
the Big Five, in their first four
games.
Stanford, on the other hand, is
relatively untested. The Card's
only win was over cellar-dwelling
Cal and the Bears have been
beaten in all of their regular
starts. Tonight will be Dallmar's
crew's first real 1 ague test.
John Windsor ~nd John Hendry
should provide plenty of offensive
punch for the Indians. Windsor
has averaged more than 14 points
per start through 12 games of the
current campaign and Hendry has
come along fast, scoring 49 points
in the last three games.
KKY TO A Card win will be the
ability of pivotmen Rich Hosley
and Mike Ledgerwood to match
the efforts of Hanson. Together
the Stanford centers have man
aged less than half of the Wash
ington star's output and Ed Corell,
6-6 forward for the invaders, has
been more effective on the boards
than either of the Farm big men.
Senior Bub Bowling and sopho
more Don Clemetson will get the
call for most of the Card's back
court duty. Bowling scored 11
points against California and has
the third highest Stanford offens
ive average. Clemetson showed a
good eye against Oregon, chalk
ing up 16 counters in one of the
teams' two meetings.


MIKE LEDGERWOOD SETS HIS SICHTS HIGH
Stanford Center Will Be in Key Spot Tonight
Here's something new: Fifteen Seatllites hope to launch some
aerials of their own at the Stanford Pavilion tonight. The Seattlites
are, of course, members of the visiting University of Washington
basketball team, Stanford's foe for two weekend hoop frays.
Although the Huskies won't send anything into orbit, their throws
to the ten-foot level will be most

important to Indian m en to r
Howie Dallmar, the Farm five and
some 2,700 home court fans.
A TEAM'S second league game
of the season shouldn't be called
a make-or-break affair but this
encounter, Stanford's second
AAWU outing, might well decide
Ihe local's title chances.
Stanford started the season
slowly, then won four of their
last six and moved into a dark
horse role in the Big Five race,
right now holding down second
spot on the strength of a win over
Cal.
