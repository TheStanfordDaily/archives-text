## Freshmen Cagers Bill Two Weekend Games 
### 
Stanford's high-scoring fresh
man basketball players look for
their sixth and seventh wins of
the season against one loss this
weekend when they play host to
Lowell High School and San Jose
City College.
THIi COLLEGIANS are good
but the Lowell game should be
just a breather, since the Lowell
Indians have lost both their
league encounters in the not too
tough San Francisco City League
by 17 and 11 point margins.
About the only thing to recom
mend Lowell is their 6-3 center,
Bill Carter. Carter is rated as the
best basketball player in San
Francisco. He is colorful, as sev
eral referees will attest. Last year
he was ejected from one game for
making uncomplimentary ges
tures at a referee who called a
foul against him.
The Frosh have steamrollered
all but one of their opponents,
winning three of their six games
by 40 or more points. Only once,
in the game lost to Cal, have they
scored less than 75 points. They
have averaged 75 points a game,
while giving up only 53.

TOM DOSE has been the lead
ing scorer with 19.5 points a
game. Rich Gritschke and Hollis
Moore also are scoring over 10
points per contest.
Opening for Stanford against
Lowell Friday night are Dose, cen
ter; Gritschke and Moore, for
wards; and Lew Shupe and John
Kennedy, guards.
