# Wrestlers Face Toughest Match
## 
### 
Coach Jack McKenna says that
the wrestling team will probably
have its toughest meet of the year
when it faces San Jose State to
night. The two teams are both ex
perienced and they are well
matched.
A change from the regular line
up will put Phil Murphy in the
1 17-lb. class in place of Pete Barn
hisel. Other changes since the last
home meet will put Frank Redle
in the 167-1 b. division, and Dick
Denney in the 177-lb. class. C. B.
Simons will be wrestling as a
heavyweight.
The outstanding match of the
night should be between Denny
and San Jose Captain Bernie
Slate.
The match will he hold in the
Encina Gym and will start at 7:30
p.m. Admission is free.
