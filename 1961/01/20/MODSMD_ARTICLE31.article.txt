# Bowles Voices Opposition To Red China Recognition
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD- Chester
Bowles yesterday firmly opposed
U.S. recognition of Red China or
its admission to the United Na
tions and said, "We are going to
defend Formosa — whatever the
cost, whatever the risk."
The testimony by the former
governor, congressman and am
bassador won him an unofficial
vote of confidence from the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee
to be Undersecretary of State in
the Kennedy Administration.
Bowles, who has been accused
of favoring a two-China policy
which would kill Chinese Nation
alist hopes of ever returning to
the mainland, said the Peiping re
gime "has selected the United
States as its adversary and No. 1
enemy."
ASKED BLUNTLY by Sen
John J. Sparkman, D-Ala., if he
would favor recognizing the Chi
nese Communists, Bowles said,
"1 don't believe we should and I
have said so on many occasions."
He said the Reds would couple
any such action with a demand
th;it Chiang Kai-Shek's island
stronghold of Formosa be made
part of the mainland and "obvi
ously we would not stand for
that." He then said Formosa
should be protected at all costs.
He was more cautious in dis
cussing the offshore islands of
Quemoy and Mat.su. which were
a major campaign issue. He said
President-elect John F. Kennedy
must solve that problem and"I
don't want to say anything to
make the problems of the new
President more difficult."
BOWLES DII) say that respon
sibility for easing tension in the
Formosa Strait should be spread
"more broadly." He explained
that if an agreement could be
reached neutralizing the area, "I
don't think that would be running
away."
He quickly added, however, that
"we should not under any circum
stances retreat under fire" if
fighting breaks out in the area.
Kennedy during the campaign
questioned the value of the is
lands—except as they are related
to the defense of Formosa.
Bowles also was asked if the
United States should withdraw
from the United Nations if Red
China were admitted—a reference
to testimony Wednesday by Adlai
E. Stevenson that it may prove

, impossible to keep the Commu
nists out.
"Under no circumstances, in my
humble opinion, should the
United States withdraw from the
United Nations," Bowles replied,
lie said there have been times
when the world organization was
seen as a weak hope for peace
but that this country must try to
make it strong.
Asked by Sparkman how he
would replace negative thinking
on the Chinese problem with posi
tive policies, the nominee said
"We can't cope with it positively
i by appeasing it. We should hope
! that gradually over the years
! some of the steam will be let out
! of the boiler."
