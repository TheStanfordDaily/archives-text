### 
"Stone rubbings" from 12th
century sandstone art wonders of
Angkor Wat go on exhibition to
day at the Stanford Museum and
I may be seen until Feb. 15.
The 2.3 stone rubbings, made
through a process comparable to
transferring the design of a coin
to paper by rubbing it with a pen
cil, were taken from sandstone
' reliefs at Angkor Wat. the great
temple of the ancient Khmer Em
pire. in Cambodia.
THE STONE rubbings were
made under the supervision of the
Cultural Center of Angkor, Cam
| bodia. and are being circulated in
this country through the Smith
sonian Institution traveling ex
hibition service.
Dancing girls, warriors, gods,
monkeys, demons, dragons, birds
I and celestial nymphs ai-e all rep
resented in the vigorous style
which is specifically Cambodian.
"In their three-dimensional
quality," says the Smithsonian re
port, "the stone rubbings have
the effect of transporting the
viewer back into the world of
luxurious pomp which surround
ed the court of the great builder
king Suryavarman 11, who con
[ structed Angkor Wat to immortal
ize himself as the Hindu God
I Vishnu."
THE TEMPLE with its five lofty
acorn-shaped towers, rising in a
: central pyramid more than 200
feet high, is comparable to the
Taj Mahal as an architectural
i wonder.
The museum is open daily from
1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free un
der a newly established policy.
There will be a charge for special
exhibitions, announced at the
i time, to help defray costs.
