# Minto Convokes Special Services

### 
Memorial Church will hold spe
cial daily prayer services next
week, in recognition of the Week
of Prayer for Christian Unity
which is observed by Roman Cath
olic, Protestant and Greek Ortho
dox churches throughout the
world.
"That Stanford should take part
in the Week of Prayer is doubly
fitting," said Rev. Robert M.
Minto, University chaplain.
"It is appropriate because we
have a non-sectarian church pro
moting unity and understanding,
and also because the final day.
Wednesday coincides with the
57th anniversary of the dedication
of Memorial Church."
Chaplain Minto will deliver the
Sunday sermon at the 11 o'clock
service. There will be Commu
nion al U:3U a.m.
