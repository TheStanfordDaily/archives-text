# TAKE OFF FAILS
## Jetliner Crashes in N.Y. Blizzard; At Least Five Die 
### 
NEW YORK i UPI» A Mexican DCS jetliner carrying 105 persons crashed and burst into flames
in a marsh last night while struggling to take off from Idlewild Airport for Mexico City in a near
blizzard.
Fire Commissioner Edward Cavanagh reported by radio-telephone to Mayor Robert F. Wagner that
"This is a bad crash. In the tail section, we have recovered quite a few bodies. We are unable to esti-

mate because of the condition of
the bodies."
Police Commissioner Stephen P.
Kennedy said a police tally com
pleted a little more than three
hours after the crash indicated
that at lea-st 99 passengers and
crew members survived.
THE PLANE apparently scarce
ly left, the ground as it neared
the end of its runway. It smashed
through a fence, crushed a car
and then plowed a 20-foot-deep
crater in the marsh. The car, a
late-model Ford, was so badly
burned it could not be determined
whether anyone was in it when it
was smashed.
Survivors hastily unfastened
their seat belts and scurried for
safety, some throng h escape
hatches and others thro u g h
smashed windows. They did not
pause to don coats or hats and
rushed into the freezing cold as
fast as they could. Moments after
the survivors escaped, the plane
burst into flames.
The airplane—which measures
half as long as a football field—
tried for a takeoff in one-fourth
of a mile visibility, a 300-foot ob
scured ceiling, and wind gusts up
to 24 knots.
IN THE CRASH, the plane
came to rest between 50 and 100
yards from the highway border
ing the airfield. The main fuse
lage of the plane burned fiercely.
Pieces of wreckage, including one
engine, lay in the middle of Rock
away Boulevard, a six-lane artery
leading from the main section of
Long Island to the beach town of
Far Rockaway.
Twenty-two injured were taken
to St. Joseph's Hospital in the Far
Rockaway section of Queens. A
few were in serious condition with
burns, fractures and lacerations.
Two persons, stewardess An
toinette Ponce De Leon of Mexico
City, and a Dutch attorney iden
tified as William Van De Heyden,
were taken to another hospital.
AUTOMOBILES and a mini
lances both sped survivors to hos
pitals for treatment or examina
tion.
The plane had been scheduled
originally to take off at 7 p.m.
EST, but departure was delayed
until shortly before 8:30 p.m. by
the blowing snowstorm. Finally
the huge aircraft roared down the
airstrip and came to a fiery end
three miles from the airport
terminal after •scarcely becoming
airborne.
News of the second major
tragedy of the U.S. commercial
jot air age in a little more than
a month prompted Rep. Steven B.
Derounian, R-N.Y., a member of
the House Subcommittee on
Transportation and Aeronautics,
to demand legislation making it
mandatory for planes to be
grounded unless visibility is at
least 2- 1 ■_» miles and the ceiling
2,500 feet.
