# Six American 'Invaders' To Be Tried in Cuba
## 
### 
HAVANA (UPl)â€”Fidel Castro's invasion-worried government an
nounced yesterday it had captured six American "invaders" and said
Ihey would go on trial shortly before a military tribunal which holds
the power of life or death.
The capture was announced as two more Cuban "terrorists" died

before a firing squad in the east-1
ern province of Camaguey, bring- j
ing to eight the number of victims
of revolutionary justice since Sun
day.
The executions were reported to
have touched off a wave of re
vulsion among Latin American
diplomats here.
There was no official indication
on the probable fate of the six
Americans captured 12 days ago |
after they landed here aboard the I
Florida-based yacht Aries. Last !
October, three Americans seized !
in a landing on the eastern tip of
Cuba were summarily shot.
The government failed to ex-!
plain why it suppressed the news <
of their capture on Jan. 7 until ;
now. However, informed sources !
said the announcement was pur
posely held back to be "timed"
for the eve of President John F.
Kennedy's inauguration.
Since the United States broke j
diplomatic relations with Cuba
last Jan. 3, Castro has kept the
nation in a continuing state of
alert against what he warned was !
an imminent invasion by Ameri- j
can forces.
