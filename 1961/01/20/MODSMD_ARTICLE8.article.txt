# Legislature Urges Longer Libe Hours
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Extension of operating hours for the Reserved Book Room and
the Westerh Civilizalion Library was recommended by Legislature
lasi night.
In a motion which will be given to library officials, LASSU mem
bers urged that the RBR remain open until 11 p.m. Sunday through
Friday, and that the Civ libe not close its doors until 10:15 p.m. Sun
flay through Friday, and stay open Saturday until 5:30 p.m.
.THE RESOLUTION can have no official result, anri its recom
mendations will go into effect only if library authorities decide they
are feasible.
The measure was adopted following a report by Women's Row
Representative Mary Grilling on what it would take to keep the li
brary open more than it now is.
She originally recommended that the rest of the main library be
kepi open later, but LASSU, after much discussion, decided to press
only for later hours for the Civ libe and RBR.
Miss Gritting noted that the library already is on a tight budget,
is understaffed and that its professional employes are working long
hours, and that extending hours would run into a considerable
amount of money.
SHE SAII) THAT library officials were willing, however, to study
the matter and make whatever improvements they could provided
funds were available and a need for longer hours could be justified.
And she urged LASSU to ask for later hours for all sections of
the main library and Civ libe. pointing out that nothing will be done
at any rate unless the money is available and LASSU might as well
try for the best possible extension.
A majority of LASSU members appeared to agree that there is
a need how sizable is unknown -for the library to extend its hours.
Both Miss Grilling and ASSU President Larry Royse reported they
had received complaints about the library hours, and felt some ex
tension was necessary .
