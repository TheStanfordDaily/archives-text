# N.Y. STRIKE
## Central RR Stops All Operations 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI) The
New York Central Railroad an
nounced last night a strike by
(560 tugboat men in New York
has forced a virtual shutdown of
.ill freight and passenger opera
tions on its entire 12,000-mile sys
tem.
The announcement came short
ly after the two-day-old Kennedy
administration sent Labor Secre
tary Arthur Goldberg here to join
emergency around-the-clock nego
tiations aimed at settling the
transportation crisis.
A preliminary meeting between
Goldberg, Gov. Nelson A. Rocke
feller, Mayor Robert F. Wagner
and others lasted about an hour.
The three officials then met sep
arately with federal mediators,
railroad negotiators and union
representatives.
TIIE LINK declared an immedi
ate embargo on all freight on its
lines running from Chicago and
St. Louis east to New York and
Boston. Only token passenger op
erations were maintained in a
few areas west of Buffalo, and
those were expected to be halted
within 48 hours.
The Central, second largest U.S.
railroad in terms of traffic vol
ume, already has been severely
crippled by shutdowns of passen
ger service resulting from train
crew refusals to cross tugboat
men's picket lines.
Central passenger service be
tween Chicago and Cleveland was
suspended last night with cancel
lation of a 10:45 p.m. train.
Spokesmen for the line blamed
picketing at Cleveland.
The line said its freight embar
go was effective immediately. All
trains in progress will complete
their runs, an official said, but
effective last night, no more
freight shipments will be accept
ed.
A CENTRAL spokesman said
that meant that railroads connect
ing with the Central will refuse to
accept shipments at their point of
origin, thus giving the strike an
impact felt across the nation.
A spokesman said the embargo
was necessary because there were
not enough crews to man the
line's freight trains, which nor
mally move an average of about
150 million tons of freight a year.
The shutdown idles 12,000 rail
way employes, but a Central
spokesman said they were not be
ing laid off because they were be
ing prevented from reporting for
work by picket lines.
TIIE STRIKE against 11 rail
roads by 660 tugboat crewmen be
gan Jan. 9, halting the movement
of railroad barges that distribute
fruit, vegetables and meat through
the metropolitan area with its 16
million population. It also has
canceled ferry service across the
Hudson River between New York
and New Jersey.
Wagner said after meeting with
Rockefeller Saturday that "there
is no reason for anyone to get
panicky," but the governor said
the effects of the strike were close
to "catastrophic" for the already
troubled railroads and for indus
tries throughout the area.
New Yorkers felt the transpor
tation pinch severely as a near
blizzard also clogged many streets
and roads. Food continued to
move into the city, thanks to
fleets of trucks thrown into emer
gency service.
