## Discrimination Clause? 
### 
The four-column, 72-point head
line on the top story in last Tues
day's Daily read: "Georgia Cam
pus Tense as Negroes Return to
Classes." Beneath it, of course,
was a lengthy story on how two
Negroes had finally cracked the
discrimination barrier at the Uni
versity of Georgia after 175 years
of segregated classes there.
On page two of that issue,
tinder the column devoted to let
ters to the editor, was another
story about discrimination —only
this one was a little more per
sonal, a little closer to home than
the United Press International
story from Athens, Ga.
For in her letter, Marie Bun
combe, a graduate student in Eng
lish from Washington, D.C., re
lated how she had been told many
times in her search for an off
campus room in this area that
there was —indeed an apartment
or room to rent —but not to a
Negro.
Since then, The Daily has been
on the receiving end of a number
of letters and personal visits from
students and faculty members
who deplore the attitude of the
persons Miss Buncombe ran up
against, and who also find it dif
ficult to understand the position
of the University administration
in not taking some type of action
in the case or for allowing per
sons who are prejudiced to reg
ister their rentals with our hous
ing office.
Anyone who has been reading
the paper since last Tuesday
should be acquainted with Stan
ford's official position on the mat
ter of discrimination in housing
listed at the office. But one thing
they don't seem to comprehend
(see letters on this page) is why
an anti-discrimination clause can't
be —and hasn't been—added to the
card which lists information con

cerning rentals.
We think they have a good
point, and one on which the Uni
versity and interested students can
act RIGHT NOW. For it should
be a simple matter to add a clause
to the rental card pledging the
landlord not to refuse rental of
his listing to any Stanford stu
dent because of race, creed, color,
etc. A person refusing to sign
•such a pledge would not be al
lowed the services of the housing
office.
It would also be relatively easy
to police such a pledge. Any stu
dent encountering discrimination
could report the matter either to
a group set up by the administra
tion or to a voluntary student
group such as Harvard possesses.
If the charge was found to be
valid, the landlord would be de
nied the use of the housing office
and his name would be circulated
in some way so that students
seeking lodging would be warned
against him.
We bet that a landlord who
rents to Stanford students, but
who successfully discriminates
now for some reason, would have
second thoughts when be found
that prospective tenants would
pass him by because they objected
to his policy. We're assuming, of
course, that students would have
the moral courage to ignore a
rental, no matter how templing, if
they knew the landlord discrimi
nated against fellow students.
While this obviously is not a
final solution to the problem, we
feel it could make an important
contribution toward ending what
is a disgrace both to local com
munities, and to Stanford for al
lowing bigoted landlords to use
free University facilities to rent
their rooms, and at times cause
great embarrassment and hurt to
Stanford students.
