President Eisenhower's farewell
address will be remembered and
quoted in the days to come. Rising
above the issues which divide the
parties and were the material of
the election campaign, ho dwelt
on a question, never before dis
cussed publicly by any responsi
ble official, which is of profound
importance to the nation's future.
The question on which he has
been blooding is how in the pres
ence "of an immense military es
tablishment and a large arms in
dustry" the supremacy of the civil
power is to be maintained. "In the
councils of government," he said,
"we must guard against the ac
quisition of unwarranted influ
ence whether sought or unsought
by the military-industrial com
plex." Surely, it is impressive that
the old soldier should make this
warning the main theme of his
farewell address. Yet he was in
the great tradition. Washington
made the theme of his farewell
address a warning against allow
ing the influence of foreign gov
ernments to invade our political
life. That was then the menace
to the civilian power. Now Eisen
hower. speaking from his experi
ence and looking ahead, is con
cerned with a contemporary
threat to the supremacy of the
civilian power. This is a problem
rarely discussed in public but if
it were not a real and serious
problem, Gen. Eisenhower would
not have devoted to it so much of
the emphasis of his last official
message to the nation.
He did not mean, of course, that
civilian supremacy can or should
be upheld hy reducing the mili
tary power of the military estab
lishment. And as we know, the
Kennedy administration is com
mitted to an increase in the mili
tary power of the military estab
lishment. How then can the dan
ger of unwarranted military in
fluence —or to iisp an old phrase
for it, the danger of militarism —
be prevented? Only by making
civilian influence greater, not by
reducing military power.
How is that to be done? Essen
tially, it can be done by appoint
ing to the civilian posts of deci
sion in the Pentagon, the State
Department, and the National Se
curity Council, civilians with
some military experience of their
own who have had personal ex
perience in public life and possess
a trained and educated intelli
gence. These civilians must work
with, they must not defer abjectly
to, the professional soldiers. One
reason why President Eisenhower
has seen the militarist danger
grow is that, with the exception of
the last one, he never had a Secre
tary of Defense who was the in
tellectual equal of the profes

sional soldiers ho had to deal
with.
Once the civilians have the self
confidence to exercise civilian su
premacy. they can and should im
pose a strict civilian discipline on
the statements and speeches is
sued by the Chiefs of Staff and by
local commanders throughout the
world.
The talkativeness of American
military men, most of them read
ing - speeches written hy profes
sional speech writers who are paid
by <be government, is an interna
tional scandal. Throughout the
world it causes lis trouble, it
causes great loss of respect and
confidence. Anyone who travels
about the world talking with lead
ers, be it behind the Iron Curtain
or on this side of it, will find him
self confronted constantly with
the loud talk of some admiral or
general. There is not any other
military establishment on earth,
I except perhaps in small disorderly
countries, which permits a run
ning commentary on critical af
fairs by its generals and admirals
and the colonels down the line.
The true solution of the prob
lem that President Eisenhower
warned the country against is to
be found in civilian appointees
who are confident and willing to
command. When such civilians
are in office, it will be possible
for the Administration to wean
the Congress and portions of the
press from their undue reliance
upon the military establishments
as the true source of the true
American policy. For then those
who have to deal with our prob
lems will learn by trial and error
that the true source of the true
policy is among the civilians who
make the policy.
Without pretending that every
thing is perfect, that every selec
tion is ideal, and that everything
is sure to be right, there is, I am
convinced, solid ground for con
fidence in the Administration
which Mr. Kennedy has organized.
It is not an Administration com
posed primarily of professional
politicians, although the head of
it is among his other aptitudes a
professional politician of the first
order. It is not an Administra
tion made up of professors drawn
out of an academic life of scholar
ship and research. It is, for the
first time in our history, an Ad
ministration manned primarily hy
professional public servants by
men whose primary careers have
long been the public service.
They will need public support.
They will need a lot of luck. Rut
I do not know of any Administra
tion in our time in which the level
of competence has been so high.

threat to the supremacy of the

civilian supremacy can or should

How is that to be done? Essen

some military experience of their

perience in public life and possess
a trained and educated intelli
gence. These civilians must work
with, they must not defer abjectly
to, the professional soldiers. One

The talkativeness of American
military men, most of them read

causes great loss of respect and
confidence. Anyone who travels
about the world talking with lead
ers, be it behind the Iron Curtain
or on this side of it, will find him
self confronted constantly with
the loud talk of some admiral or
general. There is not any other
military establishment on earth,
I except perhaps in small disorderly
countries, which permits a run

and the colonels down the line.
The true solution of the prob

warned the country against is to
be found in civilian appointees
who are confident and willing to
command. When such civilians
are in office, it will be possible
for the Administration to wean
the Congress and portions of the
press from their undue reliance
upon the military establishments
as the true source of the true
American policy. For then those
who have to deal with our prob

that the true source of the true

make the policy.
Without pretending that every

President Eisenhower's farewell
address will be remembered and
quoted in the days to come. Rising
above the issues which divide the
parties and were the material of
the election campaign, ho dwelt
on a question, never before dis
cussed publicly by any responsi
ble official, which is of profound
importance to the nation's future.
The question on which he has
been blooding is how in the pres
ence "of an immense military es
tablishment and a large arms in
dustry" the supremacy of the civil
power is to be maintained. "In the
councils of government," he said,
"we must guard against the ac
quisition of unwarranted influ
ence whether sought or unsought
by the military-industrial com
plex." Surely, it is impressive that
the old soldier should make this
warning the main theme of his
farewell address. Yet he was in
the great tradition. Washington
made the theme of his farewell
address a warning against allow
ing the influence of foreign gov
ernments to invade our political
life. That was then the menace
to the civilian power. Now Eisen
hower. speaking from his experi
ence and looking ahead, is con

threat to the supremacy of the
civilian power. This is a problem

with, they must not defer abjectly
to, the professional soldiers. One
reason why President Eisenhower
has seen the militarist danger
grow is that, with the exception of
the last one, he never had a Secre
tary of Defense who was the in
tellectual equal of the profes

sional soldiers ho had to deal
with.
Once the civilians have the self
confidence to exercise civilian su
premacy. they can and should im
pose a strict civilian discipline on

sued by the Chiefs of Staff and by
local commanders throughout the
world.
The talkativeness of American
military men, most of them read
ing - speeches written hy profes
sional speech writers who are paid
by <be government, is an interna
tional scandal. Throughout the
world it causes lis trouble, it
causes great loss of respect and
confidence. Anyone who travels
about the world talking with lead
ers, be it behind the Iron Curtain
or on this side of it, will find him
self confronted constantly with
the loud talk of some admiral or
general. There is not any other
military establishment on earth,
I except perhaps in small disorderly
countries, which permits a run
ning commentary on critical af
fairs by its generals and admirals
and the colonels down the line.
The true solution of the prob
lem that President Eisenhower
warned the country against is to
be found in civilian appointees
who are confident and willing to
command. When such civilians
are in office, it will be possible
for the Administration to wean
the Congress and portions of the
press from their undue reliance
upon the military establishments
as the true source of the true
American policy. For then those
who have to deal with our prob
lems will learn by trial and error
that the true source of the true
policy is among the civilians who
make the policy.
Without pretending that every
thing is perfect, that every selec
tion is ideal, and that everything
is sure to be right, there is, I am
convinced, solid ground for con
fidence in the Administration
which Mr. Kennedy has organized.
It is not an Administration com
posed primarily of professional
politicians, although the head of
it is among his other aptitudes a
professional politician of the first
order. It is not an Administra
tion made up of professors drawn
out of an academic life of scholar
ship and research. It is, for the
first time in our history, an Ad
ministration manned primarily hy
professional public servants by
men whose primary careers have
long been the public service.
They will need public support.
They will need a lot of luck. Rut

President Eisenhower's farewell
address will be remembered and
quoted in the days to come. Rising
above the issues which divide the
parties and were the material of
the election campaign, ho dwelt
on a question, never before dis
cussed publicly by any responsi
ble official, which is of profound
importance to the nation's future.
The question on which he has
been blooding is how in the pres
ence "of an immense military es
tablishment and a large arms in
dustry" the supremacy of the civil
power is to be maintained. "In the
councils of government," he said,
"we must guard against the ac
quisition of unwarranted influ
ence whether sought or unsought
by the military-industrial com
plex." Surely, it is impressive that
the old soldier should make this
warning the main theme of his
farewell address. Yet he was in
the great tradition. Washington
made the theme of his farewell
address a warning against allow
ing the influence of foreign gov
ernments to invade our political
life. That was then the menace
to the civilian power. Now Eisen
hower. speaking from his experi
ence and looking ahead, is con
cerned with a contemporary
threat to the supremacy of the
civilian power. This is a problem
rarely discussed in public but if
it were not a real and serious
problem, Gen. Eisenhower would
not have devoted to it so much of
the emphasis of his last official
message to the nation.
He did not mean, of course, that
civilian supremacy can or should
be upheld hy reducing the mili
tary power of the military estab
lishment. And as we know, the
Kennedy administration is com
mitted to an increase in the mili
tary power of the military estab
lishment. How then can the dan
ger of unwarranted military in
fluence —or to iisp an old phrase
for it, the danger of militarism —
be prevented? Only by making
civilian influence greater, not by
reducing military power.
How is that to be done? Essen
tially, it can be done by appoint
ing to the civilian posts of deci
sion in the Pentagon, the State
Department, and the National Se
curity Council, civilians with
some military experience of their
own who have had personal ex
perience in public life and possess
a trained and educated intelli
gence. These civilians must work
with, they must not defer abjectly
to, the professional soldiers. One
reason why President Eisenhower
