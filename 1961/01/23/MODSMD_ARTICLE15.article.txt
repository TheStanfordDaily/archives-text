Editor, the Daily:
We regret Ihe suffering of Miss
Buncombe and others in their
efforts to find adequate rooms.
We applaud Dean Winbigler's
search for a fair means of veri
fying charges of racial or reli
gious discrimination, but we arc
not convinced that the University
must find that means before it
can act forcefully.
The housing office, even with
its present small staff, can refuse
to list any lodging except by reg
istration on mimeographed slips
containing a pledge not to dis
criminate on the basis of race or
religion. The University's moral
position would then form an un
equivocal part of its informal
contract with landlords and stu
dents who use the housing list.
Since landlords would see writ
ten evidence of the policy (which
has hitherto been expressed only
occasionally, and especially to the
aggrieved person), some students
would at least be spared the re
volting experience that Miss Bun
combe had when she telephoned
landlords and found them hospit
able until she asked whether they
objected to having a Negro ten
ant.
Enforcement, then, is a separ
ate problem. Whether or not the
University wants to enlarge the
housing staff, it ought to make
its position unmistakably clear to
everyone using the services of the
housing office.

According to current observa
tions on the discrimination prob
lem in off-campus housing there
are only two possible solutions.
One of these is 1o create a stu
dent police force. (I can only
assume this idea was borrowed
from the junior traffic patrol
used so effectively in grammar
schools) and the other solution
is to abandon the University off
campus ho us in g service alto

gether. Both these answers are
somewhat less than adequate.
Would it not be more direct and
more effective to require each
person wishing to use the services
of the Stanford Housing Office to
sign an anti-discrimination clause.
This would not only create a con
tractual agreement between the
University and the individual, it
would state in very explicit terms
the fact that Stanford University
does not tolerate discrimination
on the basis of race or religion.
Such a clause would eliminate
a great number of people who
reveal their prejudices only when
confronted with the actual pros
pect of renting to an "undesirable
person." Those who signed Ihe
clause and proceeded to discrimi
nate could merely be dropped
from the list as they now are.
I doubt not: that if this plan
proves workable Ihe administra
tion will have the moral convic
tion to make use of it, not only
as a method of eliminating bad
feelings among the students, but,
more importantly, as a direct
moral influence on the commun
ity-

I find it extremely difficult to
defend the position of the Ad
ministration in the issue of hous
ing discrimination as you attempt
ed to do in your editorial of last
Thursday. Your editorial suggests
quite clearly to me that there is
some scope for action on the part
of the Administration if, as you
stated, "it does not condone such
discrimination and is . . . strongly
opposed to it."
You state that "at present,
Stanford does not list the names
of people who specify that they
are prejudiced. However, many
do not specify." It seems to me
that the University should show
its concern by asking prospec
tive landlords to specify their
prejudices; and proceed to inform

those that do not conform to the
University's code or standard that
they are ineligible to use the fa
cilities of the Housing Office.
Surely, there can be no law
against this, and I doubt very
much whether the inclusion of
one more question would necessi
tate additional staff!
How can a University with such
great national (and international)
stature as Stanford be "unable to
do much about this situation"
which exists in its immediate lo
cality? Rather than diminishing,
Stanford's stature increases as
we narrow the geographical range
to approach Palo x\lto.
Here it attains economic and,
perhaps, political importance in
addition to the intellectual. A
"great acad e m ic institution"
should set an example for the
community outside its walls. In
fact, it would seek to mould the
character of the surrounding com
munity, even to the extent of
using economic pressure such as
boycotting landlords who do not
conform to its code.

The Jan. 20th, 1961, issue of
the Daily quotes me as having
asserted that the strength of the
Chinese came when the Commu
nists "gathered up the frustra
tions of the people and turned
them to satisfactions." What I
tried to say was that the Commu
nists gathered up the frustrations
of the people and turned them
into power. Clearly, there is a
considerable difference between
the two concepts.

According to current observa
tions on the discrimination prob
lem in off-campus housing there
are only two possible solutions.
One of these is 1o create a stu
dent police force. (I can only
assume this idea was borrowed
from the junior traffic patrol
used so effectively in grammar
schools) and the other solution
is to abandon the University off
campus ho us in g service alto

gether. Both these answers are
somewhat less than adequate.
Would it not be more direct and
more effective to require each
person wishing to use the services
of the Stanford Housing Office to
sign an anti-discrimination clause.
This would not only create a con
tractual agreement between the
University and the individual, it
would state in very explicit terms
the fact that Stanford University
does not tolerate discrimination
on the basis of race or religion.
Such a clause would eliminate
a great number of people who
reveal their prejudices only when
confronted with the actual pros
pect of renting to an "undesirable
person." Those who signed Ihe
clause and proceeded to discrimi
nate could merely be dropped
from the list as they now are.
I doubt not: that if this plan
proves workable Ihe administra
tion will have the moral convic
tion to make use of it, not only
as a method of eliminating bad
feelings among the students, but,
more importantly, as a direct
moral influence on the commun

I find it extremely difficult to
defend the position of the Ad
ministration in the issue of hous
ing discrimination as you attempt
ed to do in your editorial of last
Thursday. Your editorial suggests
quite clearly to me that there is
some scope for action on the part
of the Administration if, as you
stated, "it does not condone such
discrimination and is . . . strongly
opposed to it."
You state that "at present,
Stanford does not list the names
of people who specify that they
are prejudiced. However, many
do not specify." It seems to me
that the University should show
its concern by asking prospec
tive landlords to specify their
prejudices; and proceed to inform

those that do not conform to the
University's code or standard that
they are ineligible to use the fa
cilities of the Housing Office.
Surely, there can be no law
against this, and I doubt very
much whether the inclusion of
one more question would necessi
tate additional staff!
How can a University with such
great national (and international)
stature as Stanford be "unable to
do much about this situation"
which exists in its immediate lo
cality? Rather than diminishing,
Stanford's stature increases as
we narrow the geographical range
to approach Palo x\lto.
Here it attains economic and,
perhaps, political importance in
addition to the intellectual. A
"great acad e m ic institution"
should set an example for the
community outside its walls. In
fact, it would seek to mould the
character of the surrounding com
munity, even to the extent of
using economic pressure such as
boycotting landlords who do not
conform to its code.

We applaud Dean Winbigler's

not convinced that the University
must find that means before it
can act forcefully.
The housing office, even with
its present small staff, can refuse
to list any lodging except by reg

containing a pledge not to dis
criminate on the basis of race or

One of these is 1o create a stu
dent police force. (I can only
assume this idea was borrowed
from the junior traffic patrol
used so effectively in grammar
schools) and the other solution
is to abandon the University off
campus ho us in g service alto

gether. Both these answers are
somewhat less than adequate.
Would it not be more direct and
more effective to require each
person wishing to use the services
of the Stanford Housing Office to
sign an anti-discrimination clause.
This would not only create a con
tractual agreement between the
University and the individual, it
would state in very explicit terms
the fact that Stanford University
does not tolerate discrimination
on the basis of race or religion.
Such a clause would eliminate
a great number of people who
reveal their prejudices only when
confronted with the actual pros
pect of renting to an "undesirable
person." Those who signed Ihe
clause and proceeded to discrimi
nate could merely be dropped
from the list as they now are.
I doubt not: that if this plan
proves workable Ihe administra
tion will have the moral convic

as a method of eliminating bad
feelings among the students, but,
more importantly, as a direct
moral influence on the commun

I find it extremely difficult to
defend the position of the Ad
ministration in the issue of hous
ing discrimination as you attempt
ed to do in your editorial of last
Thursday. Your editorial suggests
quite clearly to me that there is
some scope for action on the part
of the Administration if, as you
stated, "it does not condone such
discrimination and is . . . strongly
opposed to it."
You state that "at present,
Stanford does not list the names
of people who specify that they
are prejudiced. However, many
do not specify." It seems to me
that the University should show
its concern by asking prospec
tive landlords to specify their
prejudices; and proceed to inform

those that do not conform to the
University's code or standard that
they are ineligible to use the fa
cilities of the Housing Office.
Surely, there can be no law
against this, and I doubt very
much whether the inclusion of
one more question would necessi
tate additional staff!
How can a University with such
great national (and international)
stature as Stanford be "unable to
do much about this situation"
which exists in its immediate lo
cality? Rather than diminishing,
Stanford's stature increases as
we narrow the geographical range
to approach Palo x\lto.
Here it attains economic and,
perhaps, political importance in
addition to the intellectual. A
"great acad e m ic institution"
should set an example for the
community outside its walls. In
fact, it would seek to mould the
character of the surrounding com
munity, even to the extent of
using economic pressure such as
boycotting landlords who do not
conform to its code.

The Jan. 20th, 1961, issue of
the Daily quotes me as having
asserted that the strength of the
Chinese came when the Commu
nists "gathered up the frustra
tions of the people and turned
them to satisfactions." What I
tried to say was that the Commu
nists gathered up the frustrations
of the people and turned them
into power. Clearly, there is a
considerable difference between
the two concepts.

We regret Ihe suffering of Miss
Buncombe and others in their
efforts to find adequate rooms.
We applaud Dean Winbigler's
search for a fair means of veri
fying charges of racial or reli
gious discrimination, but we arc
not convinced that the University
must find that means before it
can act forcefully.
The housing office, even with
its present small staff, can refuse
to list any lodging except by reg
istration on mimeographed slips
containing a pledge not to dis
criminate on the basis of race or
religion. The University's moral
position would then form an un
equivocal part of its informal
contract with landlords and stu
dents who use the housing list.
Since landlords would see writ
ten evidence of the policy (which
has hitherto been expressed only
occasionally, and especially to the
aggrieved person), some students
would at least be spared the re
volting experience that Miss Bun
combe had when she telephoned
landlords and found them hospit
able until she asked whether they
objected to having a Negro ten
ant.
Enforcement, then, is a separ
ate problem. Whether or not the
University wants to enlarge the
housing staff, it ought to make
its position unmistakably clear to
everyone using the services of the
housing office.
