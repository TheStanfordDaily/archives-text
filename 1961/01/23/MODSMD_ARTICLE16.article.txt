Kditor, the Daily:
May I suggest a simple solu
tion to Stanford's dilemma re
garding off-campus housing for
Negro students. This problem has
been faced successfully by a large
number ol colleges and universi
ties by the simple expedient of
requiring rooming house owners
to pledge open occupancy of their
facilities.
Harvard University, for ex
ample, sends to each landlord who
seeks to list rooms with the hous
ing office a letter which tactfully
points out that Harvard and Rad
cliffe list among their student
bodies a large number of foreign
students as well as American stu
dents of minority racial and reli
gious groups.
The letter then goes on to say:
"In view of this fact, and in keep
ing with the non-discriminatory
position of the Universities, it has
been established as a policy of
this office that all housing sub
mitted for listing must be avail
able to Harvard and Radciiffe stu
dents. faculty, alumni, or em
ployees regardless of their race,
creed, color or nationality. This
office cannot include on its list
anyone who is unwilling to sub
scribe to this policy."
Enclosed with this letter is a
postcard which the rooming house
owner is asked to sign. This card
reads: "I am prepared to rent to
Harvard-Radeliffe people regard
less of their race, creed or na
tionality."
While Harvard and Radciiffe
are here cited as an example, a
large number of other colleges
and universities follow a similar
policy. A partial list of such in
stitutions includes Yale, Univer
sity of Colorado, University of
Washington, University of Cali
fornia (Berkeley), San Jose State
College, University of Minnesota,
New York University, Columbia,

Cornell University and Ohio State
University.
I am told by Mr. Franklin P.
Williams, assistant attorney gen
eral of the State of California,
who supplied me with the above
information, that his office is cur
rently surveying all colleges and
universities in California in an
effort to ascertain their policies
regarding discrimination in off
campus housing. It will be embar
assing, to say the least, if Stan
ford's name should appear on a
list of those institutions that still
permit their students to be sub
jected to the humiliations endured
by Miss Buncombe.
