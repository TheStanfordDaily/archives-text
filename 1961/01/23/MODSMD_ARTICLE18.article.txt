overshadowed a 29-point outburst
by Washington center Bill Han
son.

frantic second half.

thi 4 game for Stanford with just
seconds remaining in regulation
play but his 20-foot jump shot

was wide of the mark. His follow
shot was good, but I ho buzzer had
sounded with the scoreboard read
ing 52-52.

noble attempt to carry his team
to victory by scoring all six of
their overtime points. lie made
two foul shots and two easy lay

tive full-court press and some rod
hot shooting stampeded back to

and Washington pulled ahead by
four, as Ed Corell hit two drives.

the range and fired three sweet
jump shots to keep the Cards in

have gone against the men from
Seattle in the overtime.
WASHINGTON' empl o y o d a
zone defense which proved effec
tive in the first half when the
Indians were having no luck from
the outside, but when Clemetson
got hot it seemed to turn the tide.
