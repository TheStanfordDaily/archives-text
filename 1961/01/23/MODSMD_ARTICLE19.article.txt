### GLENN ALFORD 
The Stanford freshman hoopsters performed as expected in sweeping a weekend's action from
Lowell High School, 58-20, and from San Jose City College. 80-49.
In Friday night's game Stanford dominated every phase of play. They made 24 of 11 shots for 56

per cent to L o well's 21 per
cent, leading at the half 27-8, and

and played the second and third
units the rest of the game. Again
Dose was high scorer with l(i
points, followed by Mollis Moore
and Lew Shupe with 15 and 10
counters respectively.
For the spectator, the Lowell
game was the more entertaining.
The fans enjoyed the show put
on by Lowell coach Lloyd Neff,
whose bench dramatics delighted
them no end.
Also, Lowell would work for
Ihtee minutes to set up a play,
only to have Dose block a pass
or a shot and set up a fast break
for Stanford.
The Stanford Braves also en
joyed a successful weekend, down
ing stubborn Moffett Field 57-48
and dumping Hartnell College
66-40.
The Moffett Field game was a
rematch of the affair of last week
which saw the Braves pull out a
close one by five points. Stanford
drove to a halftime edge of 25-20,
but had to withstand a Flyer
charge that tied the game several
times late in the contest.
Chuck Wilson and Fred Pegelow
led scorers with 12 apiece, most of
their bask e t s coming on long
jumpers. Bob Whelan and Ncls
Christiansen both hit Id.
Against Hartnell the Braves
were in no danger at any time.

In Friday night's game Stanford dominated every phase of play. They made 24 of 11 shots for 56

per cent to L o well's 21 per
cent, leading at the half 27-8, and
<15-11 at the end of three quarters.
Tom Dose scored 11 points, play
ing less than a full half.
Stanford had balanced scoring
with no one else getting over six
points, Bob Ewing and Rich Hunt
getting that many.
Saturday's tilt with San Jose
was never a contest. Despite the
visitors' high rating, Stanford
broke out to a 47-19 halftime lead
and played the second and third
units the rest of the game. Again
Dose was high scorer with l(i
points, followed by Mollis Moore
and Lew Shupe with 15 and 10
counters respectively.
For the spectator, the Lowell
game was the more entertaining.
The fans enjoyed the show put
on by Lowell coach Lloyd Neff,
whose bench dramatics delighted
them no end.
Also, Lowell would work for
Ihtee minutes to set up a play,
only to have Dose block a pass
or a shot and set up a fast break
for Stanford.
The Stanford Braves also en
joyed a successful weekend, down
ing stubborn Moffett Field 57-48
and dumping Hartnell College
66-40.
The Moffett Field game was a
rematch of the affair of last week
which saw the Braves pull out a
close one by five points. Stanford
drove to a halftime edge of 25-20,
but had to withstand a Flyer
charge that tied the game several
times late in the contest.
Chuck Wilson and Fred Pegelow
led scorers with 12 apiece, most of
their bask e t s coming on long
jumpers. Bob Whelan and Ncls
Christiansen both hit Id.
Against Hartnell the Braves
were in no danger at any time.
