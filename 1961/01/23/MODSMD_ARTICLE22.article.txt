Stanford tried another late-in
the-game, hair-raising comeback
in the Pavilion Saturday night,
but this one was nipped by the
clock and Huskies C'lint Names
and Ed Co re 11 as Washington
edged the Indians 51-19 in the sec
ond of the two teams' weekend
hoop frays.
The locals were ahead with less
than two minutes to play, but Iwo
quick buckets by Names and Cor
ell gave the Indians their eighth
defeat against six wins and a 2-1
record in AAWU play.
BKIIIN'I) by six or seven points
through most of the second half,
the Cards began pressing lale in
the game and quickly whittled
down the visitors' lead. John lien
dry got the ball rolling with a
jumper, John Windsor followed
with a duplicate shot and then
Phil Kelly stole the ball, drove
for a lay up and made a three
point play out of the maneuver
by canning the ensuing foul shot.
That made it 46 47. Windsor
jumped in two more for a tem
porary Stanford lead, and the
stage was set for Names and Cor
eil.

Names picked up a pass in the
corner and scored from 20 feet
flown the baseline to put the Hus
kies hack in command, 19-48. John
Hendry netted a foul shot to even
the scoreboard at 49-all before
Corell. an amazing sophomore,
drove through a scramble of play
ers under the basket with five
seconds left for a layup and the
winning basket.
STANFORD tried one last des
peration play, taking the ball out
in the backcourt and immediately
calling a time out. Don Clemetson
passed inbounds from the mid
stripe to John Windsor who was
stationed directly under the bas
ket. However, three Huskies were
right there, too, and Windsor
couldn't get a shot away, going
out of bounds as the game ended.
The first half was almost a
carbon copy of the second except
that the Cards were a bit more
successful. Washington dominat
ed the early si ages, blanketing
the Farm with a /one defense
and slipping behind the home
five's own defenders for easy lay
ups and an eight-point lead.
IT TOOK Stanford most of the
first stanza to find a way to beat
the pesky zone; then with five
minutes left in the half the Indi
ans held the northlanders to five
counters while chalking up 11
themselves to take a 27-2(5 lead
at intermisison.
Windsor was high-point man
for the affair, twining seven of
his Hi fielder attempts and three
for three on the charity line for
17 counters. Hendry was runner
up for the locals with nine while
Corell and Names accounted for
15 and 12 points respectively for
Washington.
Stanford had a .309 shooting
percentage from the floor and
Washington had an astounding
