THE president started his first I
Sunday in the White House in an j
unconventional way. He dropped!
by his old Georgetown home to
pick up the Sunday newspaper,
called unexpectedly on a startled j
neighbor, and walked part of the!
way to church, bareheaded and
without galoshes despite the j
snow.
He attended service at Holy I
Trinity Catholic Church, where I
he has worshipped for years. The
church was packed as he went to
a front pew. A crowd of some 300
persons waited outside.
Kennedy left the White House
in a black limousine, accompanied
by his brother Ted and his friend
Fay, the man he will name Navy
undersecretary.
HE PAUSED at the doorstep of
his Georgetown home long
enough to get the paper, and then
he marched two doors away to
visit Ben Bradlee, a Newsweek
M agaz in e correspondent and
friend. Calling out "Anyone
home?" he entered the Bradlee
home lo be met by his surprised
host, who replied, "Sure, why
don't you come up for a few
minutes?"
After a short chat the president !
left for church, trudging through
the snow and waving greetings'
to pedestrians.
Back at the White House he i
met poet Robert Frost, whom he I
asked to come see him yesterday. 1
