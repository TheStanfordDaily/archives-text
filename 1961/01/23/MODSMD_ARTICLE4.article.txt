# Congress Ready for Big Week
## 
### 
WASHINGTON <UPH Con
gress must clear a lot of routine
business from its schedule before
it tackles President Kennedy's
"New Frontier" legislative pro
gram.
The business, however, is highly
important to the Kennedy ad
ministration. It includes approval
of sub-cabinet nominations and
whether the House Rules Commit
tee shall be reorganized to break
a conservative bloc which threat
ens to kill Kennedy's five major
goals.
THESE GOALS are enactment
of legislation to raise the mini
mum wage and extend its cover
age; provide federal aid to educa
tion; help areas with chronic un
employment ; pr o vide low-cost
housing; and put the cost of med
ical care for the aged under social
security.
Kennedy hopes Congress will
act speedily on his nominations
to sub-cabinet level posts.
Senate Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield of Montana hopes the
Senate, which must approve all
presidential nominations, will con
firm all nominees by the end of
the week.
LESS CERTAIN is the outcome
of the Rules Committee fight in
the House. That fight probably
will be more important to the suc
cess of the new administration
than anything that happens in the
Senate during the next few weeks.
At issue is whether a bi-parti
san conservative coalition on the
12-man Rules .Committee is to be
allowed to keep its power to
pigeonhole liberal bills that other
wise might muster enough votes
to pass the House.
