# Chaplain Explains Right Understanding of Sex
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
The right understanding of sex is somewhere between the an
archist and puritan attitudes about it, Rev. Thomas Gilby. 0.P., de
clared in Arroyo lounge last night, speaking on "Sex, Morals, and
Marriage."
The anarchistic attitude, which "is one of the noblest social phi-

losophies that has ever been de
vised, is that fundamentally all
action should be regimented by
the noblest self." The anarchist
believes that "sex is the great
liberator," Rev. Gilby explained.
TIIE DOMINICAN Father,
Catholic chaplain at Cambridge
University, believes that puritan
ism is the other extreme. Puri
tans, both Catholic and Protes
tant, believe that "sex is some
thing which is necessary to pro-

duce babies, but which should
usually be kept secret."
Father Gilby said than anarch
ism is right in believing that "hu
man beings are, in Ihe last analy
sis, above the law." He stresses
the person lo person relationship
1 in sex, rather than the platonic
male-female relationship.
The profound failing with pure
anarchism is that it forgets that
there are actions which must be
condemned when we remember
God, lie said. Father Gilby cited
complete homosexuality and di
vorce of a completed marriage as
examples of such practices.
PURITANISM ALSO was con-
I demned by Father Gilby. "The
| Puritan attitude is that sex is
I .just for creating an establish
! ment. This works havoc for thou
i sands of people who make mar
■ riage more gruesome than it need
| be.
"You can't divorce one human
i action from the stream of action
which follows it," said the Roman
Catholic chaplain. Birth control
is an example of such a divorce.
"Sex shouldn't be 'safe,'" he
stated.
"The reason why the Church
condemns contraception is not be
cause it stops babies, but because
it stops sex," he replied to a ques
j tion. Later he added. "India should
: change her economy, she shouldn't
change sex," and "I'm not so
much against contraceptives as I
am against the contraceptive at
; titude."
FATHER GILBY believes that
the principal purpose of sex is a
ishared adventure, an adventure
which should include procreation,
pleasure and friendship.
"What about pre-marital inter
course?" someone asked. "Well,"
I replied Father Gi 1 by, "you
i wouldn't expect me to be for it."
Following is the schedule of

REV. THOMAS CILBY
Focus Speaker
The right understanding of sex is somewhere between the an
archist and puritan attitudes about it, Rev. Thomas Gilby. 0.P., de
clared in Arroyo lounge last night, speaking on "Sex, Morals, and
Marriage."
The anarchistic attitude, which "is one of the noblest social phi-

losophies that has ever been de
vised, is that fundamentally all
action should be regimented by
the noblest self." The anarchist
believes that "sex is the great
liberator," Rev. Gilby explained.
TIIE DOMINICAN Father,
Catholic chaplain at Cambridge
University, believes that puritan
ism is the other extreme. Puri
tans, both Catholic and Protes
tant, believe that "sex is some
thing which is necessary to pro-

duce babies, but which should
usually be kept secret."
Father Gilby said than anarch
ism is right in believing that "hu
man beings are, in Ihe last analy
sis, above the law." He stresses
the person lo person relationship
1 in sex, rather than the platonic
male-female relationship.
The profound failing with pure
anarchism is that it forgets that
there are actions which must be
condemned when we remember
God, lie said. Father Gilby cited
complete homosexuality and di
vorce of a completed marriage as
examples of such practices.
PURITANISM ALSO was con-
I demned by Father Gilby. "The
| Puritan attitude is that sex is
I .just for creating an establish
! ment. This works havoc for thou
i sands of people who make mar
■ riage more gruesome than it need
| be.
"You can't divorce one human
i action from the stream of action
which follows it," said the Roman
Catholic chaplain. Birth control
is an example of such a divorce.
"Sex shouldn't be 'safe,'" he
stated.
"The reason why the Church
condemns contraception is not be
cause it stops babies, but because
it stops sex," he replied to a ques
j tion. Later he added. "India should
: change her economy, she shouldn't
change sex," and "I'm not so
much against contraceptives as I
am against the contraceptive at
; titude."
FATHER GILBY believes that
the principal purpose of sex is a
ishared adventure, an adventure
which should include procreation,
pleasure and friendship.
"What about pre-marital inter
course?" someone asked. "Well,"
I replied Father Gi 1 by, "you
i wouldn't expect me to be for it."
Following is the schedule of
| speeches Rev. Gilby will give the
rest of this week:
TODAY: talk on "Poetry in
Philosophy," at 4:30 p.m. in room
HI FT to a Philosophy colloquim.
Lecture oil "Religion and National
