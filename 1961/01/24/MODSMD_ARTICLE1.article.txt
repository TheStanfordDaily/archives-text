# GOP Rejects Plan To Pack Rules Body
## 
### 
WASHINGTON < UPI) House Republicansyesterday "overwhelm
ingly" rejected Speaker Sam Rayburn's plan to smooth passage of
liberal Kennedy administration legislation by enlarging the member
ship of the Rules Committee now dominated by conservatives.
Despite Rayburn's plea to them that President Kennedy's pro-

gram deserved a fair chance, GOP
Congressmen turned down his
proposal to break the deadlock on
the Rules Committee caused by a
coalition of Southern Democrats
and Republicans.
The House will vote Thursday
on Rayburn's plan to enlarge the
committee membership from 12 to
15. Since about 60 Southern Dem
ocrats are expected to reject the
proposal, Rayburn would need
25 to 30 GOP votes.
REPUBLICAN Rep. John V.
Lindsay, N.Y., leader of a liberal
GOP group that previously had
claimed 30 to 40 votes in support
of Rayburn's plan, said after the
Republican meeting that "we'll
get at least 20 votes."
Rep. Alvin O'Konski, R-Wis.,
predicted the plan would carry
by a narrow margin.
The outcome of yesterday's Re
publican conference appeared to
throw some doubt on this pros
pect, however. GOP leader
Charles A. Halleck of Indiana
said that "less than half a dozen"
members spoke out in favor of
Rayburn's plan.
HALLECK said he personally
moved to approve an earlier stand
by the GOP policy committee
against "packing" the Rules Com
mittee. Halleck announced he was
against Rayburn's proposal, and
"expressed hope" that other GOP
members would vote against it.
The vote, the result of which
was not announced, was taken
after one hour and 45 minutes of
discussion in the GOP conference.
Some of those in favor of the
proposal feared that it it weren't
passed, the Democrats could use
the Republicans as a scapegoat if
there were a congressional fail
ure to pass some of the Kennedy
legislation.
RAYBURN said that composi
tion of the Rules Committee as
inherited from the last Congress
is such that 6-6 tie votes are likely
on some of the new president's
legislative proposals.
This would mean the measures
at stake would not be cleared for
a vote in the House, since it is
the Rules Committee that decides
which legislation should go to the
floor.
Rayburn's plan would break
the rules deadlock by adding three
liberals to the committee, two
Democrats and a Republican.

the Republicans as a scapegoat if
there were a congressional fail
ure to pass some of the Kennedy
legislation.
RAYBURN said that composi
tion of the Rules Committee as
inherited from the last Congress
is such that 6-6 tie votes are likely
on some of the new president's
legislative proposals.
This would mean the measures
at stake would not be cleared for
a vote in the House, since it is
the Rules Committee that decides
which legislation should go to the
floor.
Rayburn's plan would break
the rules deadlock by adding three
liberals to the committee, two
Democrats and a Republican.
WASHINGTON < UPI) House Republicansyesterday "overwhelm
ingly" rejected Speaker Sam Rayburn's plan to smooth passage of
liberal Kennedy administration legislation by enlarging the member
ship of the Rules Committee now dominated by conservatives.
Despite Rayburn's plea to them that President Kennedy's pro-

gram deserved a fair chance, GOP
Congressmen turned down his
proposal to break the deadlock on
the Rules Committee caused by a
coalition of Southern Democrats
and Republicans.
The House will vote Thursday
on Rayburn's plan to enlarge the
committee membership from 12 to
15. Since about 60 Southern Dem
ocrats are expected to reject the
proposal, Rayburn would need
25 to 30 GOP votes.
REPUBLICAN Rep. John V.
Lindsay, N.Y., leader of a liberal
GOP group that previously had
claimed 30 to 40 votes in support
of Rayburn's plan, said after the
Republican meeting that "we'll
get at least 20 votes."
Rep. Alvin O'Konski, R-Wis.,
predicted the plan would carry
by a narrow margin.
The outcome of yesterday's Re
publican conference appeared to
throw some doubt on this pros
pect, however. GOP leader
Charles A. Halleck of Indiana
said that "less than half a dozen"
members spoke out in favor of
Rayburn's plan.
HALLECK said he personally
moved to approve an earlier stand
by the GOP policy committee
against "packing" the Rules Com
mittee. Halleck announced he was
against Rayburn's proposal, and
"expressed hope" that other GOP
members would vote against it.
The vote, the result of which
was not announced, was taken
after one hour and 45 minutes of
discussion in the GOP conference.
Some of those in favor of the
proposal feared that it it weren't
passed, the Democrats could use
the Republicans as a scapegoat if
there were a congressional fail
ure to pass some of the Kennedy
legislation.
