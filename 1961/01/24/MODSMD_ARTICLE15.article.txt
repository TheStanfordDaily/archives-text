Tito Daily has been deluged with letters in the last day or so
concerning the discrimination problem in off-campus housing.
Faculty members and students alike suggested that renters who
use our housing office should bo requested to si<rn an anti-dis
crimination clause.
All realize that such a clause does not constitute a final solu
tion to the discrimination problem, hut feel that such a move on
the part of the University is a giant step forward. Also, the Uni
versity will he taking positive action, something which is vitally
needed.
11. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Students, was impressed by
the suggestions of faculty members and students and said that
the University will do something in the near future along the
lines suggested. He is in the process of working out the details
but said the University will make an announcement shortly.
We are pleased that faculty members and students showed
an interest in the discrimination problem. Their concern will
apparently result in fairly immediate action by the University.
We only hope that details will not take too long and that this
University will go oil record very soon as another of many in
stitutions which requests renters to sign an anti-discrimination
clause.
