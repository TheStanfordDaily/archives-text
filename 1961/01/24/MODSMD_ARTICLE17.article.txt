Gordon, SIR Political Analyst, con
cerning the Algerian situation
today. Gordon is also a Rhodes
Scholar.)

In the referendum of Jan. 9, the
voters of France and Algeria ap
proved two proposals. The French
government will now be able to
establish in Algeria an autono
mous provisional government that
will include a number of Moslems
in key positions. And eventually
the Algerians will have a right to
self-determination. Beyond these
two proposals, no one is certain
what the referendum will ulti
mately mean.
The French government insists
that it means President Charles
de Gaulle now has a decisive man
date to proceed with his plans for
settling the seven-year-old Alger
ian crisis. The Algerian rebel
government (FLN) in Tunis in
sists, on the other hand, that the
referendum, far from meaning
anything decisive, was a sham.
Despite these differences of
opinion, certain trends are ap
parent. The overwhelming YES
vote on the mainland indicates
that the majority of Frenchmen
have had enough of the Algerian
struggle. Even more important
perhaps, the large number of Al
gerian Moslems who refused to
go to the i>olls shows that the
FLN commands their support.
Thus it will be no easy task for
De Gaulle to enforce proposal one,
still less to enforce proposal two.
For the FLN will oppose any
provisional government that does
not include it as the leader of the
Moslems. Only pro-French Mos
lems would probably be willing to
risk the opposition here of Ihe
FLN; but as the referendum has
shown, the majority of the Mos
lem population is willing to fol
low the FLN orders.
It might appear, then, that De
Gaulle will have to bargain with
the FLN. But this action is ex
actly what the European settlers

| and, more important, the army
(will probably resist; after all, the
J FLN is what they have been fight
ing the last few years.
Previously De Gaulle indicated
that he would be willing- to talk
with FLN representatives if they
would first agree to a cease-fire.
Unfortunately, the FLN has so
far rejected any such agreement.
It argues that to end its resist
ance before negotiations begin
would be to throw away its main
power to bargain.
Because of the referendum,
though, it is possible that the
French government right now
either is engaged in secret talks
with the FLN or is at least trying
to establish Ihem. If, previous to
| any announced agreement with
I the FLN, the French government
i takes no steps to set up the new
; provisional government, then
these talks remain a possibility.
If, on the other hand, these steps
are taken, and there is no agree
ment announced, then probably
the talks have broken down, or
they never did begin, or De Gaulle
became disgusted and wants to
j proceed on his own.
In any case the role of the
i French army in Algeria will be
j crucial. It was largely owing to
! their discontent with the former
j policies of the government in
i Paris that caused them to join the
May, 1959 rebellion. The result
was, of course, the overthrow of
the Fourth Republic. And it. was
owing only to De Gaulle's prestige
and firmness, which had won for
his position the support of the
majority of Frenchmen, that kept
the army from joining the
i thwarted Algerian rebellion of
January, 1960.
If the military leaders come to
decide, thai, because of the refer
endum, Ihe French government
will be pursuing a policy detri
mental to the welfare of Algeria,
of France and of the army itself,
i then they may join once again
with the extremists of the Right.
And this time an attempted over
throw of the government could
provoke a civil war.
