The following is in reply to
Messers. Weinig, Turk, Young
man, Lyon and Strain (Daily, Jan. 1
20) concerning Adolph Eichmann. j
There is no such thing as "the
Israeli underground" in the same
way that the CIA cannot be called 1
"the U.S. underground." The CIA
finds it justifiable to do whatever
it does because of dislike for com
munism. Israel found it justifiable
to abduct Eichmann because of
dislike for Nazism. Surely Mes
sers. WTYL&S would not claim
that everything the CIA does is
strictly legal.
Calling Adolph Eichmann "an
Argentine citizen" and comparing
him to "an American kidnaped
by Khrushchev" is a revolting
example of "pious" apologetics.
We have yet to find "an American
citizen" who has turned six mil
lion people into soap. Do Messers.
VVTYL&S really think that Argen
tina would have granted citizen
ship to THE Adolph Eichmann?
The illusion by Mess e r s.
WTYL&S to Khrushchev's NKVD
and to " mock trials in Cuba" is
strictly emotional fireworks. Is
rael has modified its law to en
able Eichmann to have the legal
counsel of his choice. Israel is
paying all the costs of Eichmann's
defense. The Israel Lawyers' As
sociation provides Dr. Servatius,
Eichmann's attorney, with all the
aid he is asking for.
The Israel Minister of Justice
has issued a directive to the press
to refrain from using such terms
| as "criminal," "murderer," etc. in
: reference to Eichmann (WTYL&S
I would probably use "citizen Eich
man"). The image conveyed by
I Messers. WTYL&S of Israelis as
1 bloodthirsty outlaws is a distor-
I tion.
Unlike the learned Messers.
WTYL&S, I know practically
nothing about "the underlying
concept of jurisprudence." Eich
mann will be tried before a panel
of five of Israel's most reputable
judges. There are no juries in
Israel courts. Messers. WTYL&S
think that they have both juris
diction and the prudence to doubt
the integrity of those judges.
What would Messers. WTYL&S
say if I, an Israeli, should pub
licly question the integrity of the
judge and jury, say, in the Alger
Hiss case, claiming mass hysteria,
etc.? Would they start deporta
tion procedures? No matter what
you think about Israel, she was
always known to have had a ju
dicial system beyond reproach,
and Messers. WTYL&S are cer
tainly in no position to question
it, nor to assess that the judges
at the Nurenberg Trials were
more "impartial toward Nazism"
than are Israeli judges of today.

There is no such thing as "the
Israeli underground" in the same
way that the CIA cannot be called 1
"the U.S. underground." The CIA
finds it justifiable to do whatever
it does because of dislike for com
munism. Israel found it justifiable
to abduct Eichmann because of
dislike for Nazism. Surely Mes
sers. WTYL&S would not claim
that everything the CIA does is
strictly legal.
Calling Adolph Eichmann "an
Argentine citizen" and comparing
him to "an American kidnaped
by Khrushchev" is a revolting
example of "pious" apologetics.
We have yet to find "an American
citizen" who has turned six mil
lion people into soap. Do Messers.
VVTYL&S really think that Argen
tina would have granted citizen
ship to THE Adolph Eichmann?
The illusion by Mess e r s.
WTYL&S to Khrushchev's NKVD
and to " mock trials in Cuba" is
strictly emotional fireworks. Is
rael has modified its law to en
able Eichmann to have the legal
counsel of his choice. Israel is
paying all the costs of Eichmann's
defense. The Israel Lawyers' As
sociation provides Dr. Servatius,
Eichmann's attorney, with all the
aid he is asking for.
The Israel Minister of Justice
has issued a directive to the press
to refrain from using such terms

: reference to Eichmann (WTYL&S
I would probably use "citizen Eich
man"). The image conveyed by
I Messers. WTYL&S of Israelis as
1 bloodthirsty outlaws is a distor-
I tion.
Unlike the learned Messers.
WTYL&S, I know practically
nothing about "the underlying

mann will be tried before a panel

judges. There are no juries in

What would Messers. WTYL&S
say if I, an Israeli, should pub
licly question the integrity of the
judge and jury, say, in the Alger
Hiss case, claiming mass hysteria,

tion procedures? No matter what
you think about Israel, she was

Unlike the learned Messers.
WTYL&S, I know practically
nothing about "the underlying
concept of jurisprudence." Eich
mann will be tried before a panel
of five of Israel's most reputable
judges. There are no juries in
Israel courts. Messers. WTYL&S
think that they have both juris
diction and the prudence to doubt
the integrity of those judges.
What would Messers. WTYL&S
say if I, an Israeli, should pub
licly question the integrity of the
judge and jury, say, in the Alger
Hiss case, claiming mass hysteria,
etc.? Would they start deporta
tion procedures? No matter what
you think about Israel, she was
always known to have had a ju
dicial system beyond reproach,
and Messers. WTYL&S are cer
tainly in no position to question
it, nor to assess that the judges
at the Nurenberg Trials were
more "impartial toward Nazism"
than are Israeli judges of today.

With regard to the letter sub
mitted by Messers. Weinig. Turk.
Youngman, Lyon and Strain
The theme of the letter, in es
sence stating that obtaining an

: unbiased judge and jury in the
' Eichmann ease in Israel is a re
i mole possibility, shows their lack
'of understanding in the whole
' ease. Don't they realize that Is-
I rael will be the epitome of un-
I biased judgment with the eyes
1 of the world on her and her ene
i mies ready to make a row over
; the slightest hint of bias? Are
j they also not aware that the Is
raeli government is paying the
I $20,000 fee to Servatius, Eieh
| mann's counsel? Why don't all
| the defenders of the injustice
| done to Eichmann raise his de
j fen.se fee?
Finally, since these gentlemen
j are so concerned with proper
jurisprudence, they should also
j ibe concerned with justice. Why
j were they not writing letters for
the past 15 years while Eichmann
was at large? Why were they not
instrumental in bringing him to
justice?
