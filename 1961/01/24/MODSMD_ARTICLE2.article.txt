HALIFAX. N.S. (UPI) A
Portuguese cruise liner carrying
600 passengers, including some
Americans, was hijacked by pas
sengers armed with maehinoguns
and grenades in Latin American
waters yesterday, the navies of
three nations reported.
The U.S. Navy said in Washing
ton that it was sending destroyers
from Puerto Rico "to intercept
the vessel under the well-defined
terms of international law govern
ing piracy and in s u r re c t i on
aboard ship." The Navy also sent
out planes to spot the Santa
Maria.
A Canadian Navy spokesman
said the uprising broke out aboard
the 20,906-ton gray-hulled liner as
it sailed from the Island of Cura
cao off Venezuela to go to Miami.
A spokesman said the vessel was
last sighted this morning, miles
off course, headed for an un
known destination.
One ship's officer was killed
and another wounded in the up
rising, the Canadian spokesman
said. The wounded officer was put
ashore at the British Island of St.
Lucia, the spokesman said, and
the ship then sailed away, with
the insurrectionists warning they
would scuttle it if a warship ap
proached.
Despite the air of near-fantasy
about the report of piracy on the
high seas, the navies of three
nations Canada, the United
States and Great Britain an
nounced the piracy and two na
tions were taking action to inter
cept the ship.
