# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION
## 
### Ken Dery 
If any man since the immortal Grantland Hire has ever mastered
the demanding science of creating sports columns thai man is Arthur
Daley. Sports columnist for Tin; New York Times since late in 19-12,
he has thrilled millions with his insight, humor, brilliant description
and class. His column Sports of the Times is more than .just a view
of a particular event. II is a record of that event awaited almost as
much as the outcome of the deed itself.
In 1956 he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize "for his outstanding
coverage and comment on the world of sports."
DA LEV'S NINETY favorite creations were put into hook form
in 19f)9 and the collection is priceless for it enables those of us who
were too young at the time of original publication to realize the
wealth the author has contributed throughout the years.
Daley, the friend of the heroes—the man they tell their secrets
to —after a dozen and a half years finally interviews himself in an
introduction to the book.
The scribe recalls his appointment 1o what is probably the number

one position in the sports writing
world.
"Considerable time lias now
elapsed since I succeeded (lie il
lustrious John Kieran as sports
columnist for The New York
Times, It came as the nicest
Christinas present I ever received.
On Christmas Eve of 1942 I was
told that I was to take over the
Sports of the Times column which
Kieran had introduced sixteen
years earlier. I was to 'continue
until further notice.' Then they
must have forgotten about me be
cause I've been at it ever since.
.Maybe it's now safe for me to as
sume that the assignment is per
manent."
Daley, a true lover of all sports
but a baseball fan of Ruthian pro
portion talks about his job a job
that surely flickers a pale orange
flame in the back of the hearts

of writers everywhere. This might tell why:
"I can't think of a more attractive way to earn a living than bo
paid to attend sports events from the best vantage point in Ihe
joint. A guy doesn't have to have his arm twisted to spend more
than a month in Florida in the dead of winter in order to inspect
that glorious invention, spring training.
"KENTUCKY IS A delight for tho week before the Kentucky
Derby. Baseball has brought me as far afield as California. So have
championship fights. The big football games serve as command per
formances in various locations. This also applies, of course, to the
World Series."
An Insaiiable Taskmaster
All is not squeals of delight, however. While it is true "the sports
columnist belongs where excitement is at its most intense, where
interest is highest," and"He gets to know practically everyone in
the sphere of athletics, hobnobbing with the heroes on terms of such
intimacy that those who are forced to worship from afar become
envious," there is another aspect to this glowing Utopia. To quote
Daley:
". . . there's another side to the coin. What's play for you is
work for me. The column can become a monster, an ogre who en
slaves the unfortunate creature whose soul it owns. lie is a cruel,
greedy and insatiable taskmaster.
"Where the sports reporter is a member of a big firm and get-s
specific assignments from the sports editor, the columnist is like a
guy in business for himself. He has to do his own planning, dig up
his own material and then turn out a thousand words of deathless
prose, day after day after day.
"He lives in a constant pressure cooker, ever on the prowl for
ideas, for angles, for background, for human interest items and for
anecdotes. Ilis every flunking process is geared in relation to the
column whose prisoner lie is."
But no matter how much of a death grip a column can put on
any writer he exists to struggle and continues to battle the monster,
like Beowulf did, oftentimes finding the Achilles' heel. This is what
separates the good ones from the handful of great ones. The critical
ability to write an interesting column on a day when nothing at all
happened.
Stengel on Daley
NO PORTRAYAL OF Daley would be complete without this
sketch of his close friend, the irrepressible Casey Stengel.
"A few years ago the Yankees won eighteen straight games and
promptly reversed their field to lose nine in a row. 1 was on vaca
tion when this happened and never saw a game. But no sooner had
I returned than Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of the Times,
invited the singular Stengel to luncheon. I was invited too, presum
ably to serve as interpreter, if necessary.
" 'What I can't understand, Mr. Stengel,' said the curious pub
lisher, 'is how a team can win eighteen straight and then lose nine
straight. Can you explain it?'
"'Certainly, Mr. Sulzberger,' said the glib Casey without batting
an eye. 'I win eighteen straight and then your Mr. Daley starts
comin' up to the Stadium to see what's goin' on. He asts so many
questions I get confused. So we lose nine straight.'
"I hadn't seen Hie old faker in a month "

than a month in Florida in the dead of winter in order to inspect
that glorious invention, spring training.
"KENTUCKY IS A delight for tho week before the Kentucky
Derby. Baseball has brought me as far afield as California. So have
championship fights. The big football games serve as command per
formances in various locations. This also applies, of course, to the
World Series."
An Insaiiable Taskmaster
All is not squeals of delight, however. While it is true "the sports
columnist belongs where excitement is at its most intense, where
interest is highest," and"He gets to know practically everyone in
the sphere of athletics, hobnobbing with the heroes on terms of such
intimacy that those who are forced to worship from afar become
envious," there is another aspect to this glowing Utopia. To quote
Daley:
". . . there's another side to the coin. What's play for you is
work for me. The column can become a monster, an ogre who en
slaves the unfortunate creature whose soul it owns. lie is a cruel,
greedy and insatiable taskmaster.
"Where the sports reporter is a member of a big firm and get-s
specific assignments from the sports editor, the columnist is like a
guy in business for himself. He has to do his own planning, dig up
his own material and then turn out a thousand words of deathless
prose, day after day after day.
"He lives in a constant pressure cooker, ever on the prowl for
ideas, for angles, for background, for human interest items and for
anecdotes. Ilis every flunking process is geared in relation to the
column whose prisoner lie is."
But no matter how much of a death grip a column can put on
any writer he exists to struggle and continues to battle the monster,
like Beowulf did, oftentimes finding the Achilles' heel. This is what
separates the good ones from the handful of great ones. The critical
ability to write an interesting column on a day when nothing at all
happened.
Stengel on Daley
NO PORTRAYAL OF Daley would be complete without this
sketch of his close friend, the irrepressible Casey Stengel.
"A few years ago the Yankees won eighteen straight games and
promptly reversed their field to lose nine in a row. 1 was on vaca
tion when this happened and never saw a game. But no sooner had
I returned than Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of the Times,
invited the singular Stengel to luncheon. I was invited too, presum
ably to serve as interpreter, if necessary.
" 'What I can't understand, Mr. Stengel,' said the curious pub
lisher, 'is how a team can win eighteen straight and then lose nine
straight. Can you explain it?'
"'Certainly, Mr. Sulzberger,' said the glib Casey without batting
an eye. 'I win eighteen straight and then your Mr. Daley starts
comin' up to the Stadium to see what's goin' on. He asts so many
questions I get confused. So we lose nine straight.'
"I hadn't seen Hie old faker in a month "


ARTHUR DALEY
'Sports of the Times'
If any man since the immortal Grantland Hire has ever mastered
the demanding science of creating sports columns thai man is Arthur
Daley. Sports columnist for Tin; New York Times since late in 19-12,
he has thrilled millions with his insight, humor, brilliant description
and class. His column Sports of the Times is more than .just a view
of a particular event. II is a record of that event awaited almost as
much as the outcome of the deed itself.
In 1956 he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize "for his outstanding
coverage and comment on the world of sports."
DA LEV'S NINETY favorite creations were put into hook form
in 19f)9 and the collection is priceless for it enables those of us who
were too young at the time of original publication to realize the
wealth the author has contributed throughout the years.
Daley, the friend of the heroes—the man they tell their secrets
to —after a dozen and a half years finally interviews himself in an
introduction to the book.
The scribe recalls his appointment 1o what is probably the number

one position in the sports writing
world.
"Considerable time lias now
elapsed since I succeeded (lie il
lustrious John Kieran as sports
columnist for The New York
Times, It came as the nicest
Christinas present I ever received.
On Christmas Eve of 1942 I was
told that I was to take over the
Sports of the Times column which
Kieran had introduced sixteen
years earlier. I was to 'continue
until further notice.' Then they
must have forgotten about me be
cause I've been at it ever since.
.Maybe it's now safe for me to as
sume that the assignment is per
manent."
Daley, a true lover of all sports
but a baseball fan of Ruthian pro
portion talks about his job a job
that surely flickers a pale orange
flame in the back of the hearts

of writers everywhere. This might tell why:
"I can't think of a more attractive way to earn a living than bo
paid to attend sports events from the best vantage point in Ihe

"A few years ago the Yankees won eighteen straight games and
promptly reversed their field to lose nine in a row. 1 was on vaca
tion when this happened and never saw a game. But no sooner had
I returned than Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of the Times,
invited the singular Stengel to luncheon. I was invited too, presum
ably to serve as interpreter, if necessary.
" 'What I can't understand, Mr. Stengel,' said the curious pub
lisher, 'is how a team can win eighteen straight and then lose nine
straight. Can you explain it?'
"'Certainly, Mr. Sulzberger,' said the glib Casey without batting
an eye. 'I win eighteen straight and then your Mr. Daley starts
comin' up to the Stadium to see what's goin' on. He asts so many
questions I get confused. So we lose nine straight.'
"I hadn't seen Hie old faker in a month "


ARTHUR DALEY
'Sports of the Times'
If any man since the immortal Grantland Hire has ever mastered
the demanding science of creating sports columns thai man is Arthur
Daley. Sports columnist for Tin; New York Times since late in 19-12,
he has thrilled millions with his insight, humor, brilliant description
and class. His column Sports of the Times is more than .just a view
of a particular event. II is a record of that event awaited almost as
much as the outcome of the deed itself.
In 1956 he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize "for his outstanding
coverage and comment on the world of sports."
DA LEV'S NINETY favorite creations were put into hook form
in 19f)9 and the collection is priceless for it enables those of us who
were too young at the time of original publication to realize the
wealth the author has contributed throughout the years.
Daley, the friend of the heroes—the man they tell their secrets
to —after a dozen and a half years finally interviews himself in an
introduction to the book.
The scribe recalls his appointment 1o what is probably the number

one position in the sports writing
world.
"Considerable time lias now
elapsed since I succeeded (lie il
lustrious John Kieran as sports
columnist for The New York
Times, It came as the nicest
Christinas present I ever received.
On Christmas Eve of 1942 I was
told that I was to take over the
Sports of the Times column which
Kieran had introduced sixteen
years earlier. I was to 'continue
until further notice.' Then they
must have forgotten about me be
cause I've been at it ever since.
.Maybe it's now safe for me to as
sume that the assignment is per
manent."
Daley, a true lover of all sports
but a baseball fan of Ruthian pro
portion talks about his job a job
that surely flickers a pale orange
flame in the back of the hearts

of writers everywhere. This might tell why:
"I can't think of a more attractive way to earn a living than bo
paid to attend sports events from the best vantage point in Ihe
joint. A guy doesn't have to have his arm twisted to spend more
than a month in Florida in the dead of winter in order to inspect
that glorious invention, spring training.
"KENTUCKY IS A delight for tho week before the Kentucky
Derby. Baseball has brought me as far afield as California. So have
championship fights. The big football games serve as command per
formances in various locations. This also applies, of course, to the
World Series."
An Insaiiable Taskmaster
All is not squeals of delight, however. While it is true "the sports
columnist belongs where excitement is at its most intense, where
interest is highest," and"He gets to know practically everyone in
the sphere of athletics, hobnobbing with the heroes on terms of such
intimacy that those who are forced to worship from afar become
envious," there is another aspect to this glowing Utopia. To quote
Daley:
". . . there's another side to the coin. What's play for you is
work for me. The column can become a monster, an ogre who en
slaves the unfortunate creature whose soul it owns. lie is a cruel,
greedy and insatiable taskmaster.
"Where the sports reporter is a member of a big firm and get-s
specific assignments from the sports editor, the columnist is like a
guy in business for himself. He has to do his own planning, dig up
his own material and then turn out a thousand words of deathless
prose, day after day after day.
"He lives in a constant pressure cooker, ever on the prowl for
ideas, for angles, for background, for human interest items and for
anecdotes. Ilis every flunking process is geared in relation to the
column whose prisoner lie is."
But no matter how much of a death grip a column can put on
any writer he exists to struggle and continues to battle the monster,
like Beowulf did, oftentimes finding the Achilles' heel. This is what
separates the good ones from the handful of great ones. The critical
ability to write an interesting column on a day when nothing at all
happened.
