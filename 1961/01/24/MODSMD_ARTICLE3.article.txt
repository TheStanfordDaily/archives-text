## 
### 
HAVANA (UPI> — A Fidel
Castro government spokesman
said yesterday Cuba will resume
dispensing firing squad "justice"
for "counter-revolutionaries" to
morrow despite rising protests
both at home and abroad.
Nearly a dozen so-called coun
ter-revolutionaries have been sen
tenced to death by army courts in
as many days. Ten were executed
and the death sentences of two
subsequently were commuted.
A FIVE-NATION group has
been appointed by the foreign
diplomatic corps in Havana to
urge Premier Castro to suspend
further executions on humani
tarian grounds.
There also were reports that
several hundred women, includ
ing many widows of alleged war
criminals shot in the past, planned
an early march on the presiden
tial palace to protest more execu
tions.
More than 630 of Castro's polit
ical foes were executed in the
early months of his accession to
power in Jan., 1959. Last year, an
additional 30 "anti-government
conspirators" also met death.
BECAUSE OF the mounting
horror at the continued execu
tions. there was some speculation
that military tribunals might in
the future abstain from passing
more death sentences.
