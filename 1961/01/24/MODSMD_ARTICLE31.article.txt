# Final 'D' Atlas Rocket Is Successful in Test Flight
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI) — The Air Force yesterday fired
its early model Atlas "D" Intercontinental Ballistic Missile on its
49th and final military test flight from this famed launching center.
The 85-foot rocket, which has come to be a symbol of U.S. missile
power, roared into a clear blue sky at about 4 p.m. (EST).
The Atlas aimed a slender 12-

foot nose cone, jammed with in
struments and radio equipment,
at a target more than 5,000 miles
to the southeast.
A highly accurate radio inertial
guidance system steered the
mighty rocket into a path that
scientists hoped would put the
nose cone within two miles of its
target, well within the limits
which would be required for a
nuclear warhead.
THIRTY MINUTES later, the
nose cone, jammed with test in
struments and radio equipment,
plunged into the ocean less than
two miles from its target, near
Ascension Island off the west
coast coast of Africa.
The Air Force said objectives
of the flight were "to evaluate
the operational guidance system"
and to find out more about how
the nose cone stands up under
the tremendous heat, of re-entry
into the earth's atmosphere.
The early model Atlas has been
selected for a variety of space
missions, including the biggest—
•sending a U.S. astronaut into
orbit around earth later this year.
