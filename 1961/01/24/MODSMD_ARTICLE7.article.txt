# National Purpose Inseparable From Christianity: Rev. Gilby
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Rev. Thomas Gilby. 0.P., de
clared in his talk about Religion
and National Purpose in Me
morial Church last night that "a
goorl Christian is a man who is
willing to get his hands dirty."
"By this I'm arguing against
any tendency to shrink from ap
plying the might to control the
light," explained Father Gilby,
who is a Dominican priest. He
believes that Christians have a
responsibility to concern them
selves with political affairs.
"NATIONAL PURPOSE cannot
be considered without considering
religion," the Catholic chaplain
at Cambridge University stated.
"That's like considering Hamlet
without considering the ghost.
"The Western concept of the
state is a product of Christianity.
The Western world will always
be either Christian or obviously
post-Christian." Father Gilby
stated that our centuries of Chris
tianity have left us with an in
delible imprint.
In a press conference before his
lecture Father Gilby criticized the
Western countries. "Our intelli
gence hasn't matched our skill,
and our character hasn't matched
our intelligence." lie said.
ONK JOURNALIST asked if he
thought there was any significant
difference between the present
and the past United States presi

dents. "I think there is much more
hope for the United States with
Kennedy," he replied, "because
ideas are going to become more
intelligible atid more articulate."
The United States has a respon
sibility to the world today because
she "represents the Old World.
I don't mean that she is senile. I
rlo mean that she is venerable,"
Father Gilby said.
"In England, a temptation to
young Christians is not to have
anything to rlo with nuclear
power," the chaplain told his au
dience. "This i« letting power be
come the prerogitive of the
wicked."
"ANARCHISM," as F a th e r
Gilby defined it," is a very ele
vated political and social theory.
It's failing is that it forgets that
Christianity is essentially a so
cial religion. It is not just con
cerned with our relationship with
God, but also our relationship
with each other."
Father Gilby's talk was spon
sored by Focus. He will speak
again at 4:1") this afternoon on
the "posl-Communist aspect of
National Purpose" in Dinkelspiel
Auditoriu m.
It is also of interest that Father
Gilby was 1 lie first Roman Cath
olic to speek in Memorial Church
since 1930. He received permission
lo speak there since there was
no other appropriate speaking
place available.

"By this I'm arguing against
any tendency to shrink from ap
plying the might to control the
light," explained Father Gilby,
who is a Dominican priest. He
believes that Christians have a
responsibility to concern them
selves with political affairs.
"NATIONAL PURPOSE cannot
be considered without considering
religion," the Catholic chaplain
at Cambridge University stated.
"That's like considering Hamlet
without considering the ghost.
"The Western concept of the
state is a product of Christianity.
The Western world will always
be either Christian or obviously
post-Christian." Father Gilby
stated that our centuries of Chris
tianity have left us with an in
delible imprint.
In a press conference before his
lecture Father Gilby criticized the
Western countries. "Our intelli
gence hasn't matched our skill,
and our character hasn't matched
our intelligence." lie said.
ONK JOURNALIST asked if he
thought there was any significant
difference between the present
and the past United States presi

dents. "I think there is much more
hope for the United States with
Kennedy," he replied, "because
ideas are going to become more
intelligible atid more articulate."
The United States has a respon
sibility to the world today because
she "represents the Old World.
I don't mean that she is senile. I
rlo mean that she is venerable,"
Father Gilby said.
"In England, a temptation to
young Christians is not to have
anything to rlo with nuclear
power," the chaplain told his au
dience. "This i« letting power be
come the prerogitive of the
wicked."
"ANARCHISM," as F a th e r
Gilby defined it," is a very ele
vated political and social theory.
It's failing is that it forgets that
Christianity is essentially a so
cial religion. It is not just con
cerned with our relationship with
God, but also our relationship
with each other."
Father Gilby's talk was spon
sored by Focus. He will speak
again at 4:1") this afternoon on
the "posl-Communist aspect of
National Purpose" in Dinkelspiel
Auditoriu m.
It is also of interest that Father
Gilby was 1 lie first Roman Cath
olic to speek in Memorial Church
since 1930. He received permission
lo speak there since there was
no other appropriate speaking
place available.
