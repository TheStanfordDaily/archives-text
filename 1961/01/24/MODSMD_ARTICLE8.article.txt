; NEW YORK (UPI) A strike
thai shut down most of the New
York Central Rail System and
plagued New York with food
! shortages and a commuters' crisis
was settled yesterday.
Union leaders credited quick
' intervention by the Kennedy ad
ministration for the settlement.
President Kennedy himself was
, on the White House phone to
Labor Secretary Arthur J. Gold
berg during the night to see how
his new cabinet member was far
ing at marathon bargaining talks
aimed at ending the two-week-old
■ harbor strike.
ONLY (WO tug boat crewmen
i were directly involved in the walk
out against 11 railroads. The
strikers were those who usually
operate barge and ferry service
across the Hudson River from
i New Jersey, but they set up
i picket lines at key transport junc
! tions here and in other sections of
' the country and within a period
| of 14 days they:
—Forced cancellation of all
j New Haven Railroad and New
; York Central Railroad service in
I and out of New York, later knock
j ing out most of the Central's en-
I tire 12,000 miles of track carrying
| passengers and freight.
