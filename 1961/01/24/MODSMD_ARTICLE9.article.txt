# Phillipsâ€”Cuba Threatens Latin American Safety
## 
### PAT REINHART 
The Cuban Revolution poses more of a threat to Latin America
than it does to the United States, Richard I. Phillips, public affairs
adviser in the State Department's Bureau of Inter-American Affairs,
declared in a lalk at Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Pnillips, who was associated with a Buenos Aires law firm before

becoming a foreign service officer
in 1946. appeared as part of the
"Cuba Now" program being spon
sored by the Institute of Inter
national Relations in cooperation
with Stanford's Committee of
Public Exercises.
Phillips stressed the point that
I Cuba, under the Batista regime,
was more than ready for a revo
i lution. Corruption in government
: and uneven distribution of wealth
! caused the people to welcome Cas
i tro's promises of clean adminis
| tration, redistribution of land, and
democratic elections.
THE FIRST clue to Castro's ac
tual intentions came, said Phillips,
1 when Castro refused United
; States aid in establishing his econ
: omy. It was no surprise when
Communist power in Cuba be
, came obvious, but subsequent
! tempts to export the revolution to
j Caribbean countries aroused sus
! picion and animosity in Cuba's
| neighbors.
Assumption of political and so
cial power by the Castro regime
| has caused discontent among the
j Cubans themselves. According to
i Phillips, his urban reform pro
! gram, coupled with food short-
I ages and devaluation of currency,
is the primary source of griev-
I anee.
Till: "HATE AMERICA" cam-
I paign launched by Castro has not
proved too influential among the
Cubans themselves. Phillips em
phasized, however, that other La
tin American countries are ripe
| for a revolution which could be
1 exploited by the Communists.
' The United States must help these
! countries to realize the danger to
j themselves and to develop their
economies.
We cannot, stated Phillips, en
| gage in counter-revolutionary ac
, tivities or interfere with foreign
domestic problems; but we can
1 continue to give economic aid in
! cooperation with the Organization
of Am erican States. Through the
i export-import bank, the United
States has loaned over two billion
| dollars in twenty-five years for
Latin American economic develop
ment projects, while private in
| vestments contribute two million
I dollars annually in salaries and
' taxes to Latin America.

Latin American countries are ripe for revolution increasing
the danger of the Cuban Revolution as an exportable product.
The Cuban Revolution poses more of a threat to Latin America
than it does to the United States, Richard I. Phillips, public affairs
adviser in the State Department's Bureau of Inter-American Affairs,
declared in a lalk at Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Pnillips, who was associated with a Buenos Aires law firm before

becoming a foreign service officer
in 1946. appeared as part of the
"Cuba Now" program being spon
sored by the Institute of Inter
national Relations in cooperation
with Stanford's Committee of
Public Exercises.
Phillips stressed the point that
I Cuba, under the Batista regime,
was more than ready for a revo
i lution. Corruption in government
: and uneven distribution of wealth
! caused the people to welcome Cas
i tro's promises of clean adminis
| tration, redistribution of land, and
democratic elections.
THE FIRST clue to Castro's ac
tual intentions came, said Phillips,
1 when Castro refused United
; States aid in establishing his econ
: omy. It was no surprise when
Communist power in Cuba be
, came obvious, but subsequent
! tempts to export the revolution to
j Caribbean countries aroused sus
! picion and animosity in Cuba's
| neighbors.
Assumption of political and so
cial power by the Castro regime
| has caused discontent among the
j Cubans themselves. According to
i Phillips, his urban reform pro
! gram, coupled with food short-
I ages and devaluation of currency,
is the primary source of griev-
I anee.
