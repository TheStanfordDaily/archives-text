# PIRACY
## Portuguese Ship Beams Radiograms 
### 
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico iIJPI)
The luxury liner Santa Maria,
seized by "patriot pirates" trying
to overthrow the strongman Por
tuguese government, beamed a
tantalizing string of radiograms
from the trackless Spanish Main
last night, but the U.S. Navy
could not find it.
As its 600 terrified passengers -
26 of them Americans and 370-
odd crewmen sailed at the bidding
of 70 heavily-armed Portuguese
buccaneers, American, British,
Dutch, and Venezuelan search ef
forts turned up nothing across the
vast tropical sea.
BRITISH officials at Port Cas
tries, St. Lucia, in the Windward
Islands, speculated the skipper
was sailing at machinegun point
either to a rebel haven in Fidel
Castro's Cuba or to Brazil, seat
of a Portuguese exile movement
against Lisbon's strongman pre
mier Dr. Antonio De Oliveira Sal
azar, who has ruled Portugal for
32 years.
IN SAO PAULO, Brazil, exiled
Portuguese opposition leader Gen.
Humberto Delgado said he mas
terminded the plot which had
been hatching for five or six
months. He said the 70-odd rebels
"would not be responsible for any
blood spilled" if warships tried to
stop the Santa Maria. He denied
reports that the ship was headed
for Cuba.
IN LISBON, Portugal turned
extra police patrols and the Por
tuguese navy ordered warships to
surround Atlantic island posses
sions to prevent any break
through by the Santa Maria.
Radio Corporation of America
in New York said the ship's radio,
silent most of the day, abruptly
came to life last night and began
to beam "we're well and safe"
messages from passengers.
Presumably, authorities were
trying to get a "fix" on the loca
tion of the vanished 20.906-ton
Portuguese liner from the radio
signals. But officials would say
only that they were stumped as
to the whereabouts of the huge
vessel.
APPARENTLY blaeked-out, the
ship was churning across tropic
waters while five U.S. Navy ra
darequipped planes probed for it.
"We have no theory as to what
action the ship may be taking,"
a Navy spokesman said here.
"Once you've got a head start
it's pretty hard to find you on
the ocean." he said.
AMERICAN and British war
ships patrolled the Windward Is
land chain but like a ghostly gal
leon, the big gray ship had given
them the slip, cruising at speeds
around 20 knots and with enough
fuel to last for a trip of several
thousand miles and enough food
for 20 days.
It could be anywhere within an
area of 600,000 square miles, the
Navy spokesman said.
But between pirate leader Hen
rique Galvao, a former Portu
guese army captain, and any safe
harbor in Cuba lay the U.S. Naval
Base at Guantanamo and the
United States' avowed intention
of catching the pirates who
threatened to scuttle and sink the
ship if stopped.
