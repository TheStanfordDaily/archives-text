## Gilby Declares ‘Communism Not the Issue’ 
### KEEM STASSEN 
"Imagine that America volun
tarily went Communist tomor
row," Rev. Thomas Gilby, 0.P.,
asked his audience yesterday af
ternoon in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium. "The issue between Rus
sian and America would still re
main."
"The profound objection the
West has to communism is to
their planned system." Father
Gilby stated. He believes that it
is vital to realize that "there are
ends outside the social, political
economy. The ultimate end is
not, as the Communists believe,
the collective good of all."
"Everyone agrees that the eco
nomically stable community is an
end," Father Gilby explained.
"For classical communism, that
end is the ultimate end. In the
United .States, that end is a means
to pursue very personal and
deeper ends."
FATHER GILBY said that the
United States was founded on two
ideas natural law and the lim
ited state. The dual heritage of
America is that "man is not re
stricted by law, he is protected
by it,"and that "the fundamental
purpose of law is to preserve free
dom."
The roots of this American idea
that man should limit the law
rather than be limited by it are
in "the Christian idea of double
citizenship, as Saint Augustine de
fined it," according to Gilby.
"WE ABE ALL born Commu
nist; we are all meant to be be
coming anarchists," the Domini
can priest declared. By this he
meant that each human is born
with an instinct to let himself be
enfolded by organized material
ism.
Each human is also born with
an opposing "instinct against be
ing enfolded by the political
group, with a recognition that
there is a higher truth than the
state," Father Gilby added.
"The real difference between
communism and the West," the
Cambridge Chaplain concluded,
"is not the difference of morals,
of kitchen utensils, or economy;
it is the difference of whether
economic end is the ultimate end
or not."
Father Gilby's lecture 011 "Re
ligion and National Purpose" was
sponsored by Focus.
The Dominican, who is the Ro
man Catholic Chaplain at Cam
bridge University, will speak
again at 4:15 this afternoon in
Cubberley Auditorium. His topic
is "Christian Unity and the Ro
man Catholic Church."
