# Inside Hoover Institute

(Editor's Note: This is 4lie first J
in a series of eight articles on the |
Hoover Institution on War, Revo-1
lotion, and Peace. This introdue- j
tory article is written by the l)i- j
rector of the Institution, W. Glenn
Campbell. The following articles
will be written by the curators of
the projects in which the Institute
is involved.)

It is almost fifty years since
Herbert Hoover began his tireless
efforts to build an institution de
voted to the study of war, revolu
tion, and peace. Shortly alter the
outbreak of World War I, he and
his staff started to collect impor
tant documents and historical ma
terials dealing with this holocaust.
The collections have since been
expanded to cover the various
wars, peace negotiations, eco
nomic and social changes of the
past 46 years.
Today, the Institution's Library
and Archives contain several mil
lion items. They comprise the rec
ords of organizations, the docu
ments of negotiations on peace
and war, the records of im
portant economic and social
forces and events as well as dia- i
lies and papers deposited by the j
participants in these events.
The Library also contains the
files of important newspapers and
magazines, pamphlets and books
—in ni a ny languages—from all
over the world, and government
documents, including many im-;
portant unpublished ones.
Communism, socialism and an-!
archism are particularly well cov-1
ered. The vast documentation of
the Russian revolution and the;
growth and spread of communism
throughout the world, is generally :
considered the outstanding col- j
lection of its kind in the Western j
world, and certainly the richest j
collection in its field in the United \
States.
Many Stanford men made im- 1
portant contributions to the'
founding and building of the
Hoover Institution to its present ;
position of pre-eminence. Any
such list must include: Dr. Ray-
Lyman Wilbur who was president
of the University at the time of ;
the founding of the Library; Pro-1
fessor E. D. Adams, the first i
chairman of the Library; Profes
sor Frank A. Colder, one of the;
Institution's greatest collectors, !
and Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, the second '
chairman of the Library.
During the forty-year period
since the establishment of the In
stitution at Stanford University
in 1920, thousands of scholars
from all over the world have come
to use its resources for research
and publication purposes.
The administrative organization
of the Institution and its relation
to Stanford are set forth in the
Trustees' Resolution of May, 1959.
The Institution is "an independent
Institution within the frame of
Stanford University." The Direc- j
tor is responsible to ihe President
and through him to the Board of |
Trustees. An Advisory Board of ;
more than fifty eminent men ,
from across the nation makes rec- |
ommendations on policy and helps j
maintain interest in the Institu- I
tion.
The funds 1o operate the Insti-1
tution come from three sources—
voluntary contributions, income
from endowment and a University
contribution. At the present time
at least one-half of our financial
requirements are provided by vol
untary contributions.
From time to time the Univer
sity contribution of $125,000 per
annum has been a subject of dis
cussion on campus. I'erhaps the
best single comparison to provide
perspective on the size of the,
University contribution is to com
pare it with the cost of operating,
maintaining and expanding the
Library. For the fiscal year 1900-
61 Library expenditures are esti
mated at some $248,000, approxi
mately twice the size of the Uni
versity's contribution.
Over the years Mr. Hoover and
his many friends have supplied
most of the money required to

build the Tower, acquire our great
collections as well as operate the
Library and the research and pub
lication program of Ihe Institu
tion.
During the past 18 months, Mr.
Hoover once again organized a
campaign which has produced
sizable sums of money both in
cash contributions and firm
pledges of future donations. Sev
eral score foundations, corpora
tions and individuals made contri
butions. One of the largest contri
butions came from the Fleisch
mann Foundation of Nevad a,
which pledged $50,000 a year for
a five-year period.
With such an incomparable Li
brary and Archives at its base, the
Hoover Institution has the po
tential to become the leading cen
ter for advanced study and re
search on problems of social,
political and economic change in
the twentieth century. Our goal
must be the pursuit of excellence
and several steps are being taken
to implement this program.
The Institution's research staff
will be expanded substantially.
Several new projects will be
launched, including a comprehen
sive history of the Third Commu
nist International. A group of
eminent scholars from the United
States as well as abroad will be
invited to serve as a consulting
task force on research. Subject
to the availability of funds, the
Institution hopes to expand its
post-doctoral research fellowship
program.
Scholarly research work under
taken at the Institution takes
several forms. First, there is the
Institution's own organized re
search and publication program.
Second, there are the many schol
ars that come here from other in
stitutions of higher learning in
the U.S. as well as abroad. Indeed,
it was the Hoover Library that
first brought Dr. Sterling to Stan
ford.
Last year, 39 scholars from
foreign countries used our Li
brary. Finally, there is the ex
tensive use made of the Institu
tion's holdings by the Stanford
faculty and students. According
to a recent survey, about half the
Ph.D. dissertations of Stanford
history and political science stu
dents during the previous twenty
years were based on Hoover Li
brary primary sources of ma
terial.
Hoover Library materials are,
of course, available to the whole
Stanford community — faculty,
staff and students tboth under
graduates as well as graduates).
Projects in process in the Insti
tution's research and publication
program include: "The Provi
sional Government of Russia:
March-November 1917" (three
volumes) by Alexander Keren sky,
former Prime Minister of the Fro
visional Government, and Profes
sor Robert P. Browder of the Uni
versity of Colorado; "Imperial
Germany in Revolution, 1917-19"
By Dr. Ralph 11. Lutz, former
chairman of the Hoover Library
and Professor Emeritus of Stan
ford, and Professor Charles Bur
dick of Sail Jose State College.
Others are: "Theory, Law and
Policy of Soviet Treaties" by Pro
fessor Jan Triska of Stanford and
Professor Robert M. Slusser of
Johns Hopkins University; "Com
munist. Activity in Africa South
of the Sahara'' under the direc
tion of Peter Duignan, Curator of
the Africa collection; "Power,
Machines and Technology--Com
munist China as an Economic
Power" by Professor Y. L. Wu of
the University of San Francisco.
The latter project is being carried
out in cooperation with the Stan
ford Research Institute.
At the dedication of the Tower
on June 20, 1941, Mr. Hoover
stated: "The purpose of this In
stitution is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace. I therefore dedicate
! this building to these purposes."
|No organization could have a
nobler aim.

(Editor's Note: This is 4lie first J
in a series of eight articles on the |
Hoover Institution on War, Revo-1
lotion, and Peace. This introdue- j
tory article is written by the l)i- j
rector of the Institution, W. Glenn
Campbell. The following articles
will be written by the curators of
the projects in which the Institute
is involved.)

It is almost fifty years since
Herbert Hoover began his tireless
efforts to build an institution de
voted to the study of war, revolu
tion, and peace. Shortly alter the
outbreak of World War I, he and
his staff started to collect impor
tant documents and historical ma
terials dealing with this holocaust.
The collections have since been
expanded to cover the various
wars, peace negotiations, eco
nomic and social changes of the
past 46 years.
Today, the Institution's Library
and Archives contain several mil
lion items. They comprise the rec
ords of organizations, the docu
ments of negotiations on peace
and war, the records of im
portant economic and social
forces and events as well as dia- i
lies and papers deposited by the j
participants in these events.
The Library also contains the
files of important newspapers and
magazines, pamphlets and books
—in ni a ny languages—from all
over the world, and government
documents, including many im-;
portant unpublished ones.
Communism, socialism and an-!
archism are particularly well cov-1
ered. The vast documentation of
the Russian revolution and the;
growth and spread of communism
throughout the world, is generally :
considered the outstanding col- j
lection of its kind in the Western j
world, and certainly the richest j
collection in its field in the United \
States.
Many Stanford men made im- 1
portant contributions to the'
founding and building of the
Hoover Institution to its present ;
position of pre-eminence. Any
such list must include: Dr. Ray-
Lyman Wilbur who was president
of the University at the time of ;
the founding of the Library; Pro-1
fessor E. D. Adams, the first i
chairman of the Library; Profes
sor Frank A. Colder, one of the;
Institution's greatest collectors, !
and Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, the second '
chairman of the Library.
During the forty-year period
since the establishment of the In
stitution at Stanford University
in 1920, thousands of scholars
from all over the world have come
to use its resources for research
and publication purposes.
The administrative organization
of the Institution and its relation
to Stanford are set forth in the
Trustees' Resolution of May, 1959.
The Institution is "an independent
Institution within the frame of
Stanford University." The Direc- j
tor is responsible to ihe President
and through him to the Board of |
Trustees. An Advisory Board of ;
more than fifty eminent men ,
from across the nation makes rec- |
ommendations on policy and helps j
maintain interest in the Institu- I
tion.
The funds 1o operate the Insti-1
tution come from three sources—
voluntary contributions, income
from endowment and a University
contribution. At the present time
at least one-half of our financial
requirements are provided by vol
untary contributions.
From time to time the Univer
sity contribution of $125,000 per
annum has been a subject of dis
cussion on campus. I'erhaps the
best single comparison to provide
perspective on the size of the,
University contribution is to com
pare it with the cost of operating,
maintaining and expanding the
Library. For the fiscal year 1900-
61 Library expenditures are esti
mated at some $248,000, approxi
mately twice the size of the Uni
versity's contribution.
Over the years Mr. Hoover and
his many friends have supplied
most of the money required to

build the Tower, acquire our great
collections as well as operate the
Library and the research and pub
lication program of Ihe Institu
tion.
During the past 18 months, Mr.
Hoover once again organized a
campaign which has produced
sizable sums of money both in
cash contributions and firm
pledges of future donations. Sev
eral score foundations, corpora
tions and individuals made contri
butions. One of the largest contri
butions came from the Fleisch
mann Foundation of Nevad a,
which pledged $50,000 a year for
a five-year period.
With such an incomparable Li
brary and Archives at its base, the
Hoover Institution has the po
tential to become the leading cen
ter for advanced study and re
search on problems of social,
political and economic change in
the twentieth century. Our goal
must be the pursuit of excellence
and several steps are being taken
to implement this program.
The Institution's research staff
will be expanded substantially.
Several new projects will be
launched, including a comprehen
sive history of the Third Commu
nist International. A group of
eminent scholars from the United
States as well as abroad will be
invited to serve as a consulting
task force on research. Subject
to the availability of funds, the
Institution hopes to expand its
post-doctoral research fellowship
program.
Scholarly research work under
taken at the Institution takes
several forms. First, there is the
Institution's own organized re
search and publication program.
Second, there are the many schol
ars that come here from other in
stitutions of higher learning in
the U.S. as well as abroad. Indeed,
it was the Hoover Library that
first brought Dr. Sterling to Stan
ford.
Last year, 39 scholars from
foreign countries used our Li
brary. Finally, there is the ex
tensive use made of the Institu
tion's holdings by the Stanford
faculty and students. According
to a recent survey, about half the
Ph.D. dissertations of Stanford
history and political science stu
dents during the previous twenty
years were based on Hoover Li
brary primary sources of ma
terial.
Hoover Library materials are,
of course, available to the whole
Stanford community — faculty,

sity contribution of $125,000 per
annum has been a subject of dis
cussion on campus. I'erhaps the
best single comparison to provide
perspective on the size of the,
University contribution is to com
pare it with the cost of operating,
maintaining and expanding the
Library. For the fiscal year 1900-
61 Library expenditures are esti
mated at some $248,000, approxi
mately twice the size of the Uni
versity's contribution.
Over the years Mr. Hoover and
his many friends have supplied
most of the money required to

build the Tower, acquire our great
collections as well as operate the
Library and the research and pub
lication program of Ihe Institu
tion.
During the past 18 months, Mr.
Hoover once again organized a
campaign which has produced
sizable sums of money both in
cash contributions and firm
pledges of future donations. Sev
eral score foundations, corpora
tions and individuals made contri
butions. One of the largest contri
butions came from the Fleisch
mann Foundation of Nevad a,
which pledged $50,000 a year for
a five-year period.
With such an incomparable Li
brary and Archives at its base, the
Hoover Institution has the po
tential to become the leading cen
ter for advanced study and re
search on problems of social,
political and economic change in
the twentieth century. Our goal
must be the pursuit of excellence
and several steps are being taken
to implement this program.
The Institution's research staff
will be expanded substantially.
Several new projects will be
launched, including a comprehen
sive history of the Third Commu
nist International. A group of
eminent scholars from the United
States as well as abroad will be
invited to serve as a consulting
task force on research. Subject
to the availability of funds, the
Institution hopes to expand its
post-doctoral research fellowship
program.
Scholarly research work under
taken at the Institution takes
several forms. First, there is the
Institution's own organized re
search and publication program.
Second, there are the many schol
ars that come here from other in
stitutions of higher learning in
the U.S. as well as abroad. Indeed,
it was the Hoover Library that
first brought Dr. Sterling to Stan
ford.
Last year, 39 scholars from
foreign countries used our Li
brary. Finally, there is the ex
tensive use made of the Institu
tion's holdings by the Stanford
faculty and students. According
to a recent survey, about half the
Ph.D. dissertations of Stanford
history and political science stu
dents during the previous twenty
years were based on Hoover Li
brary primary sources of ma
terial.
Hoover Library materials are,
of course, available to the whole
Stanford community — faculty,
staff and students tboth under
graduates as well as graduates).
Projects in process in the Insti
tution's research and publication
program include: "The Provi
sional Government of Russia:
March-November 1917" (three
volumes) by Alexander Keren sky,
former Prime Minister of the Fro
visional Government, and Profes
sor Robert P. Browder of the Uni
versity of Colorado; "Imperial

By Dr. Ralph 11. Lutz, former

(Editor's Note: This is 4lie first J
in a series of eight articles on the |
Hoover Institution on War, Revo-1
lotion, and Peace. This introdue- j
tory article is written by the l)i- j
rector of the Institution, W. Glenn
Campbell. The following articles
will be written by the curators of
the projects in which the Institute
is involved.)

It is almost fifty years since
Herbert Hoover began his tireless
efforts to build an institution de
voted to the study of war, revolu
tion, and peace. Shortly alter the
outbreak of World War I, he and
his staff started to collect impor
tant documents and historical ma
terials dealing with this holocaust.
The collections have since been
expanded to cover the various
wars, peace negotiations, eco
nomic and social changes of the
past 46 years.
Today, the Institution's Library
and Archives contain several mil
lion items. They comprise the rec
ords of organizations, the docu
ments of negotiations on peace
and war, the records of im
portant economic and social
forces and events as well as dia- i
lies and papers deposited by the j
participants in these events.
The Library also contains the
files of important newspapers and
magazines, pamphlets and books
—in ni a ny languages—from all
over the world, and government
documents, including many im-;
portant unpublished ones.
Communism, socialism and an-!
archism are particularly well cov-1
ered. The vast documentation of
the Russian revolution and the;
growth and spread of communism
throughout the world, is generally :
considered the outstanding col- j
lection of its kind in the Western j
world, and certainly the richest j
collection in its field in the United \
States.
Many Stanford men made im- 1
portant contributions to the'
founding and building of the
Hoover Institution to its present ;
position of pre-eminence. Any
such list must include: Dr. Ray-
Lyman Wilbur who was president
of the University at the time of ;
the founding of the Library; Pro-1
fessor E. D. Adams, the first i
chairman of the Library; Profes
sor Frank A. Colder, one of the;
Institution's greatest collectors, !
and Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, the second '
chairman of the Library.
During the forty-year period
since the establishment of the In
stitution at Stanford University
in 1920, thousands of scholars
from all over the world have come
to use its resources for research
and publication purposes.
The administrative organization
of the Institution and its relation
to Stanford are set forth in the
Trustees' Resolution of May, 1959.
The Institution is "an independent
Institution within the frame of
Stanford University." The Direc- j
tor is responsible to ihe President
and through him to the Board of |
Trustees. An Advisory Board of ;
more than fifty eminent men ,
from across the nation makes rec- |
ommendations on policy and helps j
maintain interest in the Institu- I
tion.
The funds 1o operate the Insti-1
tution come from three sources—
voluntary contributions, income
from endowment and a University
contribution. At the present time
at least one-half of our financial
requirements are provided by vol
untary contributions.
From time to time the Univer
sity contribution of $125,000 per
annum has been a subject of dis
cussion on campus. I'erhaps the
best single comparison to provide
perspective on the size of the,
University contribution is to com

The collections have since been
expanded to cover the various
wars, peace negotiations, eco
nomic and social changes of the
past 46 years.
Today, the Institution's Library
and Archives contain several mil
lion items. They comprise the rec
ords of organizations, the docu
ments of negotiations on peace
and war, the records of im
portant economic and social
forces and events as well as dia- i
lies and papers deposited by the j
participants in these events.
The Library also contains the
files of important newspapers and
magazines, pamphlets and books
—in ni a ny languages—from all
over the world, and government
documents, including many im-;
portant unpublished ones.
Communism, socialism and an-!
archism are particularly well cov-1
ered. The vast documentation of
the Russian revolution and the;
growth and spread of communism
throughout the world, is generally :
considered the outstanding col- j
lection of its kind in the Western j
world, and certainly the richest j
collection in its field in the United \
States.
Many Stanford men made im- 1
portant contributions to the'
founding and building of the
Hoover Institution to its present ;
position of pre-eminence. Any
such list must include: Dr. Ray-
Lyman Wilbur who was president
of the University at the time of ;
the founding of the Library; Pro-1
fessor E. D. Adams, the first i
chairman of the Library; Profes
sor Frank A. Colder, one of the;
Institution's greatest collectors, !
and Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, the second '
chairman of the Library.
During the forty-year period
since the establishment of the In
stitution at Stanford University
in 1920, thousands of scholars
from all over the world have come
to use its resources for research
and publication purposes.
The administrative organization
of the Institution and its relation
to Stanford are set forth in the
Trustees' Resolution of May, 1959.
The Institution is "an independent
Institution within the frame of
Stanford University." The Direc- j
tor is responsible to ihe President
and through him to the Board of |
Trustees. An Advisory Board of ;
more than fifty eminent men ,
from across the nation makes rec- |
ommendations on policy and helps j
maintain interest in the Institu- I
tion.
The funds 1o operate the Insti-1
tution come from three sources—
voluntary contributions, income
from endowment and a University
contribution. At the present time
at least one-half of our financial
requirements are provided by vol
untary contributions.
From time to time the Univer
sity contribution of $125,000 per
annum has been a subject of dis
cussion on campus. I'erhaps the
best single comparison to provide
perspective on the size of the,
University contribution is to com
pare it with the cost of operating,
maintaining and expanding the
Library. For the fiscal year 1900-
61 Library expenditures are esti
mated at some $248,000, approxi
mately twice the size of the Uni
versity's contribution.
Over the years Mr. Hoover and
his many friends have supplied
most of the money required to

build the Tower, acquire our great
collections as well as operate the
Library and the research and pub
lication program of Ihe Institu
tion.
During the past 18 months, Mr.
Hoover once again organized a
campaign which has produced
sizable sums of money both in
cash contributions and firm
pledges of future donations. Sev
eral score foundations, corpora
tions and individuals made contri
butions. One of the largest contri
butions came from the Fleisch
mann Foundation of Nevad a,
which pledged $50,000 a year for
a five-year period.
With such an incomparable Li
brary and Archives at its base, the
Hoover Institution has the po
tential to become the leading cen
ter for advanced study and re
search on problems of social,
political and economic change in
the twentieth century. Our goal
must be the pursuit of excellence
and several steps are being taken
to implement this program.
The Institution's research staff
will be expanded substantially.
Several new projects will be
launched, including a comprehen
sive history of the Third Commu
nist International. A group of
eminent scholars from the United
States as well as abroad will be
invited to serve as a consulting
task force on research. Subject
to the availability of funds, the
Institution hopes to expand its
post-doctoral research fellowship
program.
Scholarly research work under
taken at the Institution takes
several forms. First, there is the
Institution's own organized re
search and publication program.
Second, there are the many schol
ars that come here from other in
stitutions of higher learning in
the U.S. as well as abroad. Indeed,
it was the Hoover Library that
first brought Dr. Sterling to Stan
ford.
Last year, 39 scholars from
foreign countries used our Li
brary. Finally, there is the ex
tensive use made of the Institu
tion's holdings by the Stanford
faculty and students. According
to a recent survey, about half the
Ph.D. dissertations of Stanford
history and political science stu
dents during the previous twenty
years were based on Hoover Li
brary primary sources of ma
terial.
Hoover Library materials are,
of course, available to the whole
Stanford community — faculty,
staff and students tboth under
graduates as well as graduates).
Projects in process in the Insti
tution's research and publication
program include: "The Provi
sional Government of Russia:
March-November 1917" (three
volumes) by Alexander Keren sky,
former Prime Minister of the Fro
visional Government, and Profes
sor Robert P. Browder of the Uni
versity of Colorado; "Imperial
Germany in Revolution, 1917-19"
By Dr. Ralph 11. Lutz, former
chairman of the Hoover Library
and Professor Emeritus of Stan
ford, and Professor Charles Bur
dick of Sail Jose State College.
Others are: "Theory, Law and
Policy of Soviet Treaties" by Pro
fessor Jan Triska of Stanford and
Professor Robert M. Slusser of
Johns Hopkins University; "Com
munist. Activity in Africa South
of the Sahara'' under the direc
tion of Peter Duignan, Curator of
the Africa collection; "Power,
Machines and Technology--Com
munist China as an Economic
Power" by Professor Y. L. Wu of
the University of San Francisco.
The latter project is being carried
out in cooperation with the Stan
ford Research Institute.
At the dedication of the Tower
on June 20, 1941, Mr. Hoover
stated: "The purpose of this In
stitution is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace. I therefore dedicate
! this building to these purposes."

(Editor's Note: This is 4lie first J
in a series of eight articles on the |
Hoover Institution on War, Revo-1
lotion, and Peace. This introdue- j
tory article is written by the l)i- j
rector of the Institution, W. Glenn
Campbell. The following articles
will be written by the curators of
the projects in which the Institute
is involved.)

It is almost fifty years since
Herbert Hoover began his tireless
efforts to build an institution de
voted to the study of war, revolu
tion, and peace. Shortly alter the
outbreak of World War I, he and
his staff started to collect impor
tant documents and historical ma
terials dealing with this holocaust.
The collections have since been
expanded to cover the various
wars, peace negotiations, eco
nomic and social changes of the
past 46 years.
Today, the Institution's Library
and Archives contain several mil
lion items. They comprise the rec
ords of organizations, the docu
ments of negotiations on peace
and war, the records of im
portant economic and social
forces and events as well as dia- i
lies and papers deposited by the j
participants in these events.
The Library also contains the
files of important newspapers and
magazines, pamphlets and books
—in ni a ny languages—from all
over the world, and government
documents, including many im-;
portant unpublished ones.
Communism, socialism and an-!
archism are particularly well cov-1
ered. The vast documentation of
the Russian revolution and the;
growth and spread of communism
throughout the world, is generally :
considered the outstanding col- j
lection of its kind in the Western j
world, and certainly the richest j
collection in its field in the United \
States.
Many Stanford men made im- 1
portant contributions to the'
founding and building of the
Hoover Institution to its present ;
position of pre-eminence. Any
such list must include: Dr. Ray-
Lyman Wilbur who was president
of the University at the time of ;
the founding of the Library; Pro-1
fessor E. D. Adams, the first i
chairman of the Library; Profes
sor Frank A. Colder, one of the;
Institution's greatest collectors, !
and Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, the second '
chairman of the Library.
During the forty-year period
since the establishment of the In
stitution at Stanford University
in 1920, thousands of scholars
from all over the world have come
to use its resources for research
and publication purposes.
The administrative organization
of the Institution and its relation
to Stanford are set forth in the
Trustees' Resolution of May, 1959.
The Institution is "an independent
Institution within the frame of
Stanford University." The Direc- j
tor is responsible to ihe President
and through him to the Board of |
Trustees. An Advisory Board of ;
more than fifty eminent men ,
from across the nation makes rec- |
ommendations on policy and helps j
maintain interest in the Institu- I
tion.
The funds 1o operate the Insti-1
tution come from three sources—
voluntary contributions, income
from endowment and a University
contribution. At the present time
at least one-half of our financial
requirements are provided by vol
untary contributions.
From time to time the Univer
sity contribution of $125,000 per
annum has been a subject of dis
cussion on campus. I'erhaps the
best single comparison to provide
perspective on the size of the,
University contribution is to com
pare it with the cost of operating,
maintaining and expanding the
Library. For the fiscal year 1900-
61 Library expenditures are esti
mated at some $248,000, approxi
mately twice the size of the Uni
versity's contribution.
Over the years Mr. Hoover and
his many friends have supplied
most of the money required to

build the Tower, acquire our great
collections as well as operate the
Library and the research and pub
lication program of Ihe Institu
tion.
During the past 18 months, Mr.
Hoover once again organized a
campaign which has produced
sizable sums of money both in
cash contributions and firm
pledges of future donations. Sev
eral score foundations, corpora
tions and individuals made contri
butions. One of the largest contri
butions came from the Fleisch
mann Foundation of Nevad a,
which pledged $50,000 a year for
a five-year period.
With such an incomparable Li
brary and Archives at its base, the
Hoover Institution has the po
tential to become the leading cen
ter for advanced study and re
search on problems of social,
political and economic change in
the twentieth century. Our goal
must be the pursuit of excellence
and several steps are being taken
to implement this program.
The Institution's research staff
will be expanded substantially.
Several new projects will be
launched, including a comprehen
sive history of the Third Commu
nist International. A group of
eminent scholars from the United
States as well as abroad will be
invited to serve as a consulting
task force on research. Subject
to the availability of funds, the
Institution hopes to expand its
post-doctoral research fellowship
program.
Scholarly research work under
taken at the Institution takes
several forms. First, there is the
Institution's own organized re
search and publication program.
Second, there are the many schol
ars that come here from other in
stitutions of higher learning in
the U.S. as well as abroad. Indeed,
it was the Hoover Library that
first brought Dr. Sterling to Stan
ford.
Last year, 39 scholars from
foreign countries used our Li
brary. Finally, there is the ex
tensive use made of the Institu
tion's holdings by the Stanford
faculty and students. According
to a recent survey, about half the
Ph.D. dissertations of Stanford
history and political science stu
dents during the previous twenty
years were based on Hoover Li
brary primary sources of ma
terial.
Hoover Library materials are,
of course, available to the whole
Stanford community — faculty,
staff and students tboth under
graduates as well as graduates).
Projects in process in the Insti
tution's research and publication
program include: "The Provi
sional Government of Russia:
March-November 1917" (three
volumes) by Alexander Keren sky,
former Prime Minister of the Fro
visional Government, and Profes
sor Robert P. Browder of the Uni
versity of Colorado; "Imperial
Germany in Revolution, 1917-19"
By Dr. Ralph 11. Lutz, former
chairman of the Hoover Library
and Professor Emeritus of Stan
ford, and Professor Charles Bur
dick of Sail Jose State College.
Others are: "Theory, Law and
Policy of Soviet Treaties" by Pro
fessor Jan Triska of Stanford and
Professor Robert M. Slusser of
Johns Hopkins University; "Com
munist. Activity in Africa South
of the Sahara'' under the direc
tion of Peter Duignan, Curator of
the Africa collection; "Power,
Machines and Technology--Com
munist China as an Economic
Power" by Professor Y. L. Wu of
the University of San Francisco.
The latter project is being carried
out in cooperation with the Stan
ford Research Institute.
At the dedication of the Tower
on June 20, 1941, Mr. Hoover
stated: "The purpose of this In
stitution is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace. I therefore dedicate
