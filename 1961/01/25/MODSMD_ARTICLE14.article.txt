It is nearly impossible to deter-j
inline what Ihe French army will
| decide to do. For one thing, De
i Gaulle has been trying, since he j
entered office in 1958, to bring!
j the army under political control.
; How .successful he has been only
j future events will show.
For another thing, (he French!
! army is notorious for acting ac-i
j cording to its own logic, and this i
; logic is anything but rational. Its
development goes back to 1940, j
to the fall of the Third Republic, j
At that time the French army
j was demoralized, outmoded, and
I anti-republican. Indeed the mili
j tary seemed to feel that the "cor
rupt" politicians of the Republic
had undermined the strength of!
both the army and nation.
But if the army believed France 1
had failed it, a number of French
men believed the converse was
true, that the French army had
failed them, and thus the army's
I stature rapidly diminished. By the
end of the war, moreover, the
i army was, like the entire nation,
split into Gaullist, Vichylte, and
I Partisan forces. The result was
that the military was determined
never again to allow the army to
be put in a position where it
would be divided against itself.
Detached from its homeland,
the army for the last 21 years
has been a state-within-a-state. In
Indo-China, for example, it found
itself fighting a war that, before
the defeat of Dienbienphu, was
I of little concern to the French
j nation. Although once again the
i military blamed the "corrupt" pol- j
i iticians for its defeat, it was not i
1 completely blind to what had hap
pened in Indo-China. In fact it
; drew the lesson from the com
i munist guerrilla tactics there that
in any future conflict, propagan- j
da and the control of minds would J
be important tactics of the French !
army.
Eventually a new doctrine of '
! revolutionary warfare, copied
i from the Communists, became an j
; essential part of the French !
j army's policy. The first oppor- i
tunity to execute this policy came I
; in 1954, when the Algerian insur- j
rection erupted. There propagan- 1
da, good works like building roads ;
1 and teaching in schools, good re- |
■lations with the Moslem popula
j tion, became as important as win
! ning an actual battle.
Moreover, as a corollary of its
doctrine of revolutionary warfare,
the French military deduced a
startling theory, a mystique that
the Algerian conflict was much I
more than just a colonial con
flict. It was rather a conflict of j
worldwide significance, a part of
the long range war that has al
ready begun between Internation
al Communism and the West. And
in this momentous conflict the
French army was supposed to be
representing western civilization
itself.
The French military authorities
in Algeria became convinced, in
; other words, that its role from
i then on would be equivalent to:
the role the communist parties
| have in the people's democracies
—the role of the revolutionary
force. And if for awhile only, it
1 realized that the Third World War
is already on, then it does not
! matter. For the French army;
! would resign itself to its mission.

i to fight on for the western world.
Thus every so often a French gen
eral in Algeria will remark that
were France to abandon the land
to the Moslems, it would auto
-1 matically become an outpost of
i Communism.
It is precisely this revolution
ary doctrine and mystique that
! de Gaulle for the last two years
I has been trying to get the mili
i tary to abandon. Time and again
I he has told it that its only duty

is 1o slick to fighting, to leave
all political considerations to the
government. On \v hel her t lie
army has clone this, or will do it.
hangs the fate of not only Algeria
but the French Fifth Republic.
