# Hunting Falcons
## 
### 
Persons interested in forming a club
devoted to acquiring and training
hunting falcons and hawks are re
quested to send a postcard to 2496
Fordham, Palo Alto, at their earliest
convenience.
A trapping expedition is planned for
spring vacation and four additional
participants are needed. Persons
with definite knowledge of nesting
sites in the Northern California area,
or with contacts in the U.S. Forest
Service, are encouraged to join.
Faineants will be rejected. Respect
for the class "raptor" is primary.
