Stanford Day at Pebble Beach
Tho Stanford almunus making the most noise in the sports world
over the weekend wacs golfer Bob Rosburg. All Bob did was win the
Bing Crosby National Pro-Amateur event at Pebble Beach last
Sunday and pocket $0,300 for playing the 72 holes in fewer strokes
than any of the world's other pro swingers.
The 31-year-old Rosburg, still a Palo Alto resident, was a main
stay of the 1917 Stanford team which placed third in the national
college championships, and then in 1918, his last year of competition,
he turned in some more brilliant golf to lead the Farm squad to an
other winning season.
Al/nint (.11 AS a senior in 1918 he did qualify for the Masters
a tournament rated right along with the U.S. Open in prestige Bob
never really showed championship form in his undergraduate days.
On local courses in matches with neighboring colleges Bob was
shooting in the middle and low seventies, but he didn't qualify as j
ihe first man on the Card team and late in the season he was beaten
out of a starting spot for the Pacific Coast Conference Tourney.
Thus Rosburg's victory four days ago was part of a long climb
up the golfing ladder from an unknown Stanofrd player to one
of the best in the professional arnks.
Till; \\ IN AT I'KBKI.K Beach didn't come easily; Bob was three
strokes behind after the first day, moved up to a challenging position
after the next 18 with a 130 total and then Saturday fell seven shots
behind Ted Kroll, tho third-round leader.
On the final day only three of the money players oculd break par
and eleven pros Kroll among them soared to 80 and above. Bob
picked up all seven strokes and then added a one-stroke winning !
margin by sinking a 1."5-foot pressure putt on tho final green.
However, Bob had to wait it out before he was sure of his victory.
Bob Collins and Dave Ragen were playing behind him and were in
position to tie or win. But Ragan took a double bogey on the par three
17th and Collins came up to the 18th green needing a putt almost in
length to Rosburg's ofr a tie. Rosburg watched as Collins stroked it,
missed, and missed coming back and the ex-Card's final round of
72 was good enough.
Thus Rosburg added the Crosby to his impressive win in the
1959 PGA Tourney.
Another Rosburg
THERE MAY BE ANOTHER Bob Rosburg in our midst too, for
while alumnus Bob manhandled the play-for-pay competitors, a
current Stanford student, junior Bill Parish, was taking charge of
the amateur proceedings.
Amateur scores aren't recorded in lite Crosby, but Parish toured
the links in an estimated (58 in the second day's play, helping his.pro
partner, Tommy Jacobs, by 13 strokes in the pro-am. The duo went
on to finish third in the event with a four-round total of 2."5."5.
Altogether the Card linkster pared II strokes off Jacobs efforts
and you can just bet that the pro was glad for tho help. The third
place finish was worth $1,500 to Tom and that was $1.500 more than
he won in the pro division.
FAKISH, AN EC'ON major, isn't entirely unused to playing top
flight golf. Last season he scored a 66 in a practice round on the
Stanford course, a five under par performance.
Another Farm graduate, Frank Tatum, completed a Stanford
sweep of the Crosby as he teamed with professional VVes Ellis and
contributed 37 strokes to the pair's first-place finish in the pro-am.
Tatum also got his start on the Stanford golf team, playing under
Eddie Twiggs who coached the squad for 17 years, beginning in
1932. It was during Twiggs' reign with Tatum playing on several of
the teams that the Indian linksters were most powerful. Twiggs'
squads won the NCAA team title in 1938. '39. '11, '42 and again in 1946.
OTHER EX-CARDS at the tourney were Lawson Little. John
Brodie, and Bob Rons. Roos played in the simon-pure ranks and paired
up with Dutch Harrison to place in the money in the mixed competi
tion. Brodie tried his luck in the pro division and failed to make the
cut, an indication the 49er quarterback might concentrate on foot
ball. Little, an all-time great and one-time U.S. amateur champion,
confined himself to a spectator's role.

never really showed championship form in his undergraduate days.
On local courses in matches with neighboring colleges Bob was
shooting in the middle and low seventies, but he didn't qualify as j
ihe first man on the Card team and late in the season he was beaten
out of a starting spot for the Pacific Coast Conference Tourney.
Thus Rosburg's victory four days ago was part of a long climb
up the golfing ladder from an unknown Stanofrd player to one
of the best in the professional arnks.
Till; \\ IN AT I'KBKI.K Beach didn't come easily; Bob was three
strokes behind after the first day, moved up to a challenging position
after the next 18 with a 130 total and then Saturday fell seven shots
behind Ted Kroll, tho third-round leader.
On the final day only three of the money players oculd break par
and eleven pros Kroll among them soared to 80 and above. Bob
picked up all seven strokes and then added a one-stroke winning !
margin by sinking a 1."5-foot pressure putt on tho final green.
However, Bob had to wait it out before he was sure of his victory.
Bob Collins and Dave Ragen were playing behind him and were in
position to tie or win. But Ragan took a double bogey on the par three
17th and Collins came up to the 18th green needing a putt almost in
length to Rosburg's ofr a tie. Rosburg watched as Collins stroked it,
missed, and missed coming back and the ex-Card's final round of
72 was good enough.
Thus Rosburg added the Crosby to his impressive win in the
1959 PGA Tourney.
Another Rosburg
THERE MAY BE ANOTHER Bob Rosburg in our midst too, for
while alumnus Bob manhandled the play-for-pay competitors, a
current Stanford student, junior Bill Parish, was taking charge of
the amateur proceedings.
Amateur scores aren't recorded in lite Crosby, but Parish toured
the links in an estimated (58 in the second day's play, helping his.pro
partner, Tommy Jacobs, by 13 strokes in the pro-am. The duo went
on to finish third in the event with a four-round total of 2."5."5.
Altogether the Card linkster pared II strokes off Jacobs efforts
and you can just bet that the pro was glad for tho help. The third
place finish was worth $1,500 to Tom and that was $1.500 more than
he won in the pro division.
FAKISH, AN EC'ON major, isn't entirely unused to playing top
flight golf. Last season he scored a 66 in a practice round on the
Stanford course, a five under par performance.
Another Farm graduate, Frank Tatum, completed a Stanford
sweep of the Crosby as he teamed with professional VVes Ellis and
contributed 37 strokes to the pair's first-place finish in the pro-am.
Tatum also got his start on the Stanford golf team, playing under
Eddie Twiggs who coached the squad for 17 years, beginning in
1932. It was during Twiggs' reign with Tatum playing on several of
the teams that the Indian linksters were most powerful. Twiggs'
squads won the NCAA team title in 1938. '39. '11, '42 and again in 1946.
OTHER EX-CARDS at the tourney were Lawson Little. John
Brodie, and Bob Rons. Roos played in the simon-pure ranks and paired
up with Dutch Harrison to place in the money in the mixed competi
tion. Brodie tried his luck in the pro division and failed to make the
cut, an indication the 49er quarterback might concentrate on foot
ball. Little, an all-time great and one-time U.S. amateur champion,
confined himself to a spectator's role.

On the final day only three of the money players oculd break par
and eleven pros Kroll among them soared to 80 and above. Bob
picked up all seven strokes and then added a one-stroke winning !
margin by sinking a 1."5-foot pressure putt on tho final green.
However, Bob had to wait it out before he was sure of his victory.
Bob Collins and Dave Ragen were playing behind him and were in
position to tie or win. But Ragan took a double bogey on the par three
17th and Collins came up to the 18th green needing a putt almost in
length to Rosburg's ofr a tie. Rosburg watched as Collins stroked it,
missed, and missed coming back and the ex-Card's final round of
72 was good enough.
Thus Rosburg added the Crosby to his impressive win in the
1959 PGA Tourney.
Another Rosburg
THERE MAY BE ANOTHER Bob Rosburg in our midst too, for
while alumnus Bob manhandled the play-for-pay competitors, a
current Stanford student, junior Bill Parish, was taking charge of
the amateur proceedings.
Amateur scores aren't recorded in lite Crosby, but Parish toured
the links in an estimated (58 in the second day's play, helping his.pro
partner, Tommy Jacobs, by 13 strokes in the pro-am. The duo went
on to finish third in the event with a four-round total of 2."5."5.
Altogether the Card linkster pared II strokes off Jacobs efforts
and you can just bet that the pro was glad for tho help. The third
place finish was worth $1,500 to Tom and that was $1.500 more than
he won in the pro division.
FAKISH, AN EC'ON major, isn't entirely unused to playing top
flight golf. Last season he scored a 66 in a practice round on the
Stanford course, a five under par performance.
Another Farm graduate, Frank Tatum, completed a Stanford
sweep of the Crosby as he teamed with professional VVes Ellis and
contributed 37 strokes to the pair's first-place finish in the pro-am.
Tatum also got his start on the Stanford golf team, playing under
Eddie Twiggs who coached the squad for 17 years, beginning in
1932. It was during Twiggs' reign with Tatum playing on several of
the teams that the Indian linksters were most powerful. Twiggs'
squads won the NCAA team title in 1938. '39. '11, '42 and again in 1946.
OTHER EX-CARDS at the tourney were Lawson Little. John
Brodie, and Bob Rons. Roos played in the simon-pure ranks and paired
up with Dutch Harrison to place in the money in the mixed competi
tion. Brodie tried his luck in the pro division and failed to make the
cut, an indication the 49er quarterback might concentrate on foot
ball. Little, an all-time great and one-time U.S. amateur champion,
confined himself to a spectator's role.
Stanford Day at Pebble Beach
Tho Stanford almunus making the most noise in the sports world
over the weekend wacs golfer Bob Rosburg. All Bob did was win the
Bing Crosby National Pro-Amateur event at Pebble Beach last
Sunday and pocket $0,300 for playing the 72 holes in fewer strokes
than any of the world's other pro swingers.
The 31-year-old Rosburg, still a Palo Alto resident, was a main
stay of the 1917 Stanford team which placed third in the national
college championships, and then in 1918, his last year of competition,
he turned in some more brilliant golf to lead the Farm squad to an
other winning season.
Al/nint (.11 AS a senior in 1918 he did qualify for the Masters
a tournament rated right along with the U.S. Open in prestige Bob
never really showed championship form in his undergraduate days.
On local courses in matches with neighboring colleges Bob was
shooting in the middle and low seventies, but he didn't qualify as j
ihe first man on the Card team and late in the season he was beaten
out of a starting spot for the Pacific Coast Conference Tourney.
Thus Rosburg's victory four days ago was part of a long climb
up the golfing ladder from an unknown Stanofrd player to one
of the best in the professional arnks.
Till; \\ IN AT I'KBKI.K Beach didn't come easily; Bob was three
strokes behind after the first day, moved up to a challenging position
after the next 18 with a 130 total and then Saturday fell seven shots
behind Ted Kroll, tho third-round leader.
On the final day only three of the money players oculd break par
and eleven pros Kroll among them soared to 80 and above. Bob
