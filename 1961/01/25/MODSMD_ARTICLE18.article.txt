# Windsor Leads Cage Stats
## Daily Sports 
### 
AETIIOUOII Stanford's basket
ball record is a not-too-impressive
6 wins and 8 defeats, the team
sitll has compiled the best defen
sive record in Big Five competi
tion holding the opposition to
.">3.7 points per game and is cur
rently in second place in the
AAWU standings.
Stanford has shown hot and
cold stretches in their offense and
their shooting percentage of 34.6
from the floor and 63.5 from the
free throw line bear this out.
Another example in basketball
statistics which explains the Stan-

ford record is the full 6' < better
showing by opponents in both
field goal and free throw depart
ments in their offenses despite
the Cards' ability to keep their
scores down.
STANFORD has also been out
rebounded under the opposing
boards by all Card opponents and
as evidenced in Saturday's de
feat by Washington the opposi
tion has made a lot of easy tips
and baskets in close when they
shouldn't have.
Stanford individual scorers are
led by junior forward John Wind
sor. This 6'B" member of the Card
front line has been averaging over
14 points a game against all op
ponents and his 21 points in Stan
ford's winning effort over highly
regarded Utah is team high for
the season.
WINDSOR is followed by John
Hendry, senior co-captain in scor
ing. Hendry, who has come on
strong of late and has averaged
over 12 points per game in league
play, is at almost a nine-point
per game average so far this sea
son.
Bub Bowling and Don Clemet
son follow right behind in team

scoring. The Stanford backcourt
duo have both averaged around
eight points per game in Stan
ford's rather evenly balanced
scoring attack.
Windsor leads in rebounds with
a 101 total and is followed by
center Mike Ledgerwod with 81.
Ledgerwood's 15 grabs against
Washington is the team individual
high for one game thus far
Bowling leads the Cards from
the free throw line with II for
57 and a 72'< average. The Card
co-captain is closely followed by
Hendry whose 25 for 36 gives him
a 69.4 percentage.
NOT SIHPRISINO, Windsor
leads in the field goal shooting

with 79 made in 2<>2 attempts.
However once again, the .jump
shooting forward Hendry follows
close in scoring with 49 goals
sunk and leads in shooting per
centage with a 39.5 average.
Stanford cagcrs take the floor,
again up north February 3 and
1 as they finish off Washington
and Washington State from their
schedules.
