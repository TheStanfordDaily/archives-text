## Draft-dodging Time-isms Dealt With by Old Boy 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE 
Behind a fairly uninspired cover, the January issue of the Stan
ford Chaparral combines a good, funnier (i.e., somewhat sexier) than
usual collection of humor with one of the silliest protests against
the selective service ol' Elly has read. But the Queen's all-time.
In the guise of an outcry against ROTC the Old Boy indicts

I Congress for glorifying the un
educated, married-young men of
' America by exempting them from
I the draft because of early family
| acquirement, while subjecting un
married college graduates to liv
| ing hell in the U.S. armed services.
He forgets that the services
j need the ability and training of
1 the college elite of America not
i only to provide leadership for the
1 best national defense possible, but
| to make the military years more
valuable for all concerned. If, by
chance, Ihe Ancient One is trying
to lie funny, he fails.
THE OLD BOY'S point about
the massive draft dodging en
trenched in the country's ivied
; halls is good, however. It leads
into Judy Skinner's "The Horn
Blows at 5" which devastates the
adviser system and "Coming of
Age in the Army," a Salinger
esque spoof of Stanford and the
world in general.
The mag's best feature is a two
! page satire of Time ("the Repub
lican Digest"), the Ratio, and the
damned international situation.
; Although the Time-isms are a
little overworked. I'm forced to
endorse the article (but I've can
celed my plane reservations after
checking Webster's Unabridged,
Ip. 993, to find out what they're
really doing in Turin).
THE QUEEN, Jane Cliffton, is.
according to the Chappie and
the Stanford-conditioned eyes of
your observer the most amaz
ing babe in the woods since Diana
stopped stalking Attic forests.
Sadly, there's little flesh visible,
' but just enough ol set off the
I automatic sprinklers in The
Daily Shack.
The Chappie ad men triumph in
this issue too, with subtly hilari
ous artwork, pies and layout in
a few spots, e.g., the "Reanto
, King of the Pizza" blurb confront
-1 ing Dicky Barkley for Lanz, in
! side front cover.
A lot of pulchritude fills the
l ads, too, although Jessica Seiter
is wasted on page 28 and Barb
Ewing almost fades out of page f>.
Till-; JOKES are banal and ob
vious mostly, and the cartoons,
except for a couple of Doug New
tons and some lifted from other
mags. lose. "Moon Pitchers" is
perceptive as usual and the film
clips with dialog added are funny,
and, oceitring mostly in England,
lend an international flavor to
this usually provincial sheet.
The price of the Chaparral is
again 1<) eentavo.s, and il looks as
if no cut is in sight. The magazine
is on sale loduj on Quad.
