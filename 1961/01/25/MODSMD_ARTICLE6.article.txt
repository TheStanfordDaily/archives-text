# Hutchins States American Education Deteriorating
## Hopes Bright Future Ahead 
### FRANCES FISHER 
"The purpose of education is
for the continuous development of
our highest intelligence. We now
have the time to develop a civil
ization as brilliant as the Greeks
and far more lasting."
These weie the optimistic re
marks concluding a pessimistic
speech by Robert M. Hutchins,
leading American educator, in hi-s
talk entitled "Higher Education
and the National Purpose" given
last night at Memorial Audi
torium.
Throughout his talk Hutchins
stressed the unprecedented oppor
tunity which faces the world |

| today. "We are on the move to
| ward our goal of production with-
I out people" toward a society in
! which people do not have to work.
"AUTOMATION raises the
! question "What do we do with
j our goods, and what do we do
with ourselves?" Hutchins an
j swered the first part of that
| question by advocating giving and
; selling goods to the underprive
j leged; his answer to the second
; part lay in his advocacy of an
I "enormous increase in the intel
| lectual power in the nation."
HUTCHIN'S pessimism was di
| rected at what he felt is now
happening in America."The pres
ent aim of mass education is to
produce the 'interchangeable
adult' which industry requires."
Adjusting the child to the group
has become the aim of American
education, to the detriment of in
tellectual development.
"Our new society needs new
ideas," Hutchins stated. "We need
to re-examine our ideas in the
light of our present situation."
He pointed out the inconsistencies
I between our ideals and our cir
j cumstances. such as in politics
j where we retain our individual
istic idealism but live in a bureau
cratic society.
"IN EDUCATION we retain the
idea that education develops in
tellectual powers, but we have
made our educational centers to
i turn out people to consume goods
lo keep our economic system
I going. Students emerge from
! schools ready to take their place
on the American assembly line,"
Hutchins said.
In his answers to questions by
Professors Robert Walker and
Bernard Haley and students
James Bischoff and Steven
Corker, Hutchins re-emphasized
his antipathy toward specializa
tion in American education, and
his doubtfulness that "we shall
â– see a reversal of the deteriorating
trends in American education."

Continuing the discussion of
national purpose, Dean of Human
ities and Sciences I'hilip Rhine
lander, Dean of Education Isaac
({uillen and Professor of Philoso
phy John .'Mothershead will take
part in a panel discussion, "Stan
ford University and the National
Purpose," tonight at 7:30 iu Cub
berley Auditorium. Vice-Provost
Robert Wert will preside.
