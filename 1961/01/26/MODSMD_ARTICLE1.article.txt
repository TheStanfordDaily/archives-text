# UNIVERSITY HOUSING POLICY SET
## New Listing Policy Settles Stand on Non-discrimination 
### 
A non-discrimination pledge has been added to the form used
to list rentals in Stanford's housing office. Dean of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler announced yesterday.
The new form requii*es every landlord wishing to have his rental
listed in the office to sign the following statement:
"I hereby agree not to distinguish among applicants for the above

{ describe facilities on the basis of
i arce, creed, color or national ori
! gin, nor to discriminate against
any applicant on these grounds."
THE NEW application form and
j a memorandum and statement
from Winbigler and the housing
office explaining the reason for
the new application and clarifying
the official policy of the Univer
sity are in the mail now 1o the
1,500 active and inactive landlords
| currently on the office's rolls.
In noting the reason for the ac
tion in his statement, the dean
said: "Within the past four weeks
two Stanford students seeking
to rent rooms on the basis of list
ings maintained by the housing
of ice have reported humiliating
experiences as a result of alleged
discriminatory practices.
"THESE incidents suggest that
the University has not made clear
its policies in this regard, and that
steps should be taken to assure
that property owners and man
agers are fully informed about
them in the future.
"Hereafter the . . . statement
will be provided to owners and
managers wishing to make use of
the listing service."
RACI A L discrimination does
not exist in student residences,
the policy statement points out,
and it is "assumed that owners
and managers of pioperties avail
able to Stanford students will ob
serve the same policy."
The administration action came
after the publication last week of
a letter written to The Daily by
graduate student Marie Bun
combe telling of her experience
in being refused rental of an off
campus property listed in the
housing office because she is a
Negro.
THE DIVERSITY of the Stan
ford community, including men
and women of various nationali
ties, races and religions is an im
protant educational asset to the
University and a significant cul
tural asset to the surrounding
area, Winbigler emphasized in
his statement.

The administration action came
after the publication last week of
a letter written to The Daily by
graduate student Marie Bun
combe telling of her experience
in being refused rental of an off
campus property listed in the
housing office because she is a
Negro.
THE DIVERSITY of the Stan
ford community, including men
and women of various nationali
ties, races and religions is an im
protant educational asset to the
University and a significant cul
tural asset to the surrounding
area, Winbigler emphasized in
his statement.
A non-discrimination pledge has been added to the form used
to list rentals in Stanford's housing office. Dean of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler announced yesterday.
The new form requii*es every landlord wishing to have his rental
listed in the office to sign the following statement:
"I hereby agree not to distinguish among applicants for the above

{ describe facilities on the basis of
i arce, creed, color or national ori
! gin, nor to discriminate against
any applicant on these grounds."
THE NEW application form and
j a memorandum and statement
from Winbigler and the housing
office explaining the reason for
the new application and clarifying
the official policy of the Univer
sity are in the mail now 1o the
1,500 active and inactive landlords
| currently on the office's rolls.
In noting the reason for the ac
tion in his statement, the dean
said: "Within the past four weeks
two Stanford students seeking
to rent rooms on the basis of list
ings maintained by the housing
of ice have reported humiliating
experiences as a result of alleged
discriminatory practices.
"THESE incidents suggest that
the University has not made clear
its policies in this regard, and that
steps should be taken to assure
that property owners and man
agers are fully informed about
them in the future.
"Hereafter the . . . statement
will be provided to owners and
managers wishing to make use of
the listing service."
RACI A L discrimination does
not exist in student residences,
the policy statement points out,
and it is "assumed that owners
and managers of pioperties avail
able to Stanford students will ob
serve the same policy."
