# To Stanford Alumni

### 
The Doily learns that many Stanford alumni are concerned.
They feel that some mysterious and sinister atmosphere has settled
over our campus. Tliev feel that for some inexplicable reason
Stanford students are much more "radical" than Slanford students
used to he.
They will he glad lo learn, however, that llieir fears are hased
on a misconception. The only consistent contact the alumni have
with Stanford is I lie student newspaper. The student newspaper
in recent months has contained some editorials which could be
termed "radical" by those who find it necessary to break every
thing down into those four omnipresent isms: radicalism, liber
alism, conservatism, and reactionism.
But The Daily's editorial opinions do not necessarily reflect
the opinions of the student body. As a matter of fact, the opinions
of The Daily rarelv coincide with the opinions of the entire stu
dent bodv. This is not a regrettable situation, regardless of what
some people think. It is, on the contrary, a healthy situation.
The Daily feels that a student newspaper should serve in two
capacities: as a disseminator of campus, national and international
news, and, perhaps more importantly, as a stimulator of thought.
This does not mean that The Daily does not believe in what it ad
vocates, that it is controversial just to be controversial.
Controversy in itself is not necessarily conducive lo social or
political improvement. But something of value can emerge from
divergent viewpoints. Nothing of value can emerge from a stag
nant pool.
The Daily has not intentionally followed a policy of radical
ism, liberalism, conservatism or reactionism. If we must use an
ism, then let it be "thoughtism." The Daily is confident that the
alumni are not opposed to thought. We are equally confident that
when alumni were undergraduates they, too, disagreed on issues
of the day. We are also confident that Stanford alumni realize
the importance of dissent. None of us should forget that it was a
group of dissenters who built our nation. Neither should any of
us forget that dissenters are needed to maintain our nation.
No, The Stanford Daily does not represent the opinions of the
student body. The opinions of faculty members are not always the
same as those of their students. But surely we do not want con
formity of thought in our classrooms. Nor should we want it
among tlie students themselves. Therefore, may the misconception
that The Daily represents the views of the entire student body
forever rest in peace.

used to he.
They will he glad lo learn, however, that llieir fears are hased
on a misconception. The only consistent contact the alumni have
with Stanford is I lie student newspaper. The student newspaper
in recent months has contained some editorials which could be
termed "radical" by those who find it necessary to break every
thing down into those four omnipresent isms: radicalism, liber
alism, conservatism, and reactionism.
But The Daily's editorial opinions do not necessarily reflect
the opinions of the student body. As a matter of fact, the opinions
of The Daily rarelv coincide with the opinions of the entire stu
dent bodv. This is not a regrettable situation, regardless of what
some people think. It is, on the contrary, a healthy situation.
The Daily feels that a student newspaper should serve in two
capacities: as a disseminator of campus, national and international
news, and, perhaps more importantly, as a stimulator of thought.
This does not mean that The Daily does not believe in what it ad
vocates, that it is controversial just to be controversial.
Controversy in itself is not necessarily conducive lo social or
political improvement. But something of value can emerge from
divergent viewpoints. Nothing of value can emerge from a stag
nant pool.
The Daily has not intentionally followed a policy of radical
ism, liberalism, conservatism or reactionism. If we must use an
ism, then let it be "thoughtism." The Daily is confident that the
alumni are not opposed to thought. We are equally confident that
when alumni were undergraduates they, too, disagreed on issues
of the day. We are also confident that Stanford alumni realize
the importance of dissent. None of us should forget that it was a
group of dissenters who built our nation. Neither should any of
us forget that dissenters are needed to maintain our nation.
No, The Stanford Daily does not represent the opinions of the
student body. The opinions of faculty members are not always the
same as those of their students. But surely we do not want con
formity of thought in our classrooms. Nor should we want it
among tlie students themselves. Therefore, may the misconception
that The Daily represents the views of the entire student body
forever rest in peace.
The Doily learns that many Stanford alumni are concerned.
They feel that some mysterious and sinister atmosphere has settled
over our campus. Tliev feel that for some inexplicable reason
Stanford students are much more "radical" than Slanford students
used to he.
