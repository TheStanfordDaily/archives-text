The inaugural address was a
remarkably successful piece, of
self-expression. It sounded the
keynote, exemplified the qualities,
which the world has come to ex
pect of the President. The address
was brief, it. was deliberate and
decisive, it was efficient and ar
dent.
It was not a statement of new
policies, although it implied that
there would be new policies. It
was rather a restatement in fresh
terms of the purposes in which
virtually all of us in this country
believe. For the nation is not di
vided about the purposes which
the President affirmed.
Why then has the address been
received not only here but almost
everywhere else, except in China,
with so much hope and anticipa
tion? Mr. Kennedy was announc
ing no purpose which Mr. Eisen
hower before him had not declared,
and it was evident that as he
heard the address, Mr. Eisen
hower was moved and pleased.
The hope and anticipation with
which the old purposes have bwn
received are due to the belief in
the strength and the efficiency of
the Kennedy administration. Dur
ing that election, and since then
by the way in which he put to
gether his Administration, Mr.
Kennedy has built up the impres
sion that it has the know-how to
do what it decides to do.
It remains to be seen, of course,
whether President Kennedy can
do what so many people believe
lie will do. The central weakness
of the Eisenhower administration
was that the noble generalities
which the President proclaimed
were so often not the principles
of action in the Administration
over which he presided. He was
detached from, not in command
of, the State Department, the
Pentagon, and the other great
agencies of national power. There
is good reason lo hope that in this
crucial respect things will now be
different.
To say this is to remind our
selves that after the good recep
tion Mr. Kennedy has had in Mos

cow, and even in Havana, the real
work which is waiting to be done
is enormous. To translate tfcie
great generalities into policies,
and to translate the policies into
programs, is a work which has
barely been begun. The exchange
of civilities, which is very wel
come, is an invitation to begin
that work, let us hope, not only
in Washington but in Moscow as
well. It is a recognition also that
the work cannot be done by hasty
improvisation.
Mr. Kennedy is not, one might
say, the new captain of a ship
which has an experienced crew
who can carry out whatever
orders he sends down from the
bridge. Mr. Kennedy is the new
captain of a ship which at 4he
crucial posts also has a comple
ment of new officers. For some
time to come the new captain will
be very much preoccupied with
the training of his crew and with
the laying out of his course.
During that time, which will be
soitae months, the conduct of for
eign policy is bound to be experi
mental and exploratory rather
than substantial and conclusive.
For we are not ready, the gov
ernment and public opinion are
not ready, for really genuine ne
gotiation on disarmament. The
problem of disarmament first has
to be restudied profoundly. The
government and the public are
| not yet ready for negotiation
| about an accommodation in cen
tral Europe. Quite evidently there
is no near prospect of an accom
modation with Red China. It may
i be possible to untangle the Loa
j tian affair. It may be possible to
start a movement of conciliation
about Cuba among the American
republics. It may be possible to
persuade Mr. Khrushchev to abate
liis violence and irreconcilability
about the United Nations.
But the Administration will
| have 1o work hard and public
opinion will have to be informed
and persuaded. We must not ex
pect too much, and when we are
disappointed we must perservere.
