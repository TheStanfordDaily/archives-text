of Eastern European Collections
When World War II broke out
collecting in Eastern Europe was
hampered but not interrupted.
Funds given in 1939 to collecting
agents in Budapest, Prague and
Warsaw for war emergency,
brought in crates of valuable war
time publications after the termi
nation of hostilities. The "cold j
war" again reduced acquisition j
possibilities in the Soviet Union
and its satellites for some six
years. Although the worse of this j
period has passed, there are still
some difficulties in obtaining all
the desired material.
The Hoover Institution's hold-!
ings on Eastern Europe contain
broad and valuable research ma
terials on government, politics, t
economy, social conditions, de
mography. and related subjects
in the particular countries. Lin-;
guistics, literature, fiction, arts, j
sciences and related subjects are
beyond the Institution's collecting ;
scope.
The best and largest is the col-1
lection on Russia. It is one of the
five largest collections on that 1
area in the United States, and
probably the best in this country I
for the period 1914-1925. The col- I
lections on Czechoslovakia and j
Poland are next in size and im-1
porta nee. The material on the i
Baltic states, Hungary and Yugo
slavia offers somewhat limited
research possibilities, but is high
ly rated among similar collections
in the United States. The collec- j
tions on Albania, Bulgaria, Greece
and Rumania are rather weak
and spotty.
These collections are greatly
strengthened by archives on East
ern European developments since
1914. This primary source ma
terial is unmatched in any other
American library. Sometimes
theSe materials reached the
Hoover Tower in a most ingenious |
manner. The archives of the Paris }
office of the imperial Russian
secret police comprising a ma.s- j
sive bulk of some 5,000 pounds of
files, photographs, index-cards,
books and other materials, are
perhaps a good example.
These materials were secretly
removed from the premises of
the Russian Embassy in Paris
when the French government rec
ognized the Soviet government in
1924 and turned over the embassy
building to Ihe Bolsheviks. The
last pre-Soviet ambassador re
fused to turn over this historically
invaluable material to the Com
munists and offered it to Mr.
Hoover.
The ambassador's condition was
that the Hoover Institution would
not divulge the possession of this
material before his death, as he
had assured the French authori
ties that the material was de
stroyed. He lived another thirty
years, and the secret was faith
fully kept until 1957, the date of
his death. After his death the
secret police archives was resur
rected and with it all the skeletons
of its secret agents.
Closely related to the material
on the Soviet Union is the excel
lent collection on communism. It
covers the history, development
and present state of the move

merit". Its international aspects as
well as developments in each East
European country are documented
by a wealth of publications of ihe
Communist International <1919-
1943). the Cominform (1947-
1956*, international front organ
izations (Red Trade International,
Young Communist International,
etc.Â». and ihc Communist Parties
in East European countries, in
cluding the Soviet Union. Ma
terial on communism in the re
maining parts of the world is
included in other area collections.
Publications of anti-Communist
organizations complement, this
collection.
Prospective users of these
treasures of scholarship should
realize, however, that at least 75

per cent of all printed and manu
script materials on these coun
tries in the Hoover Institution is
in the native languages of these
nations. Despite this language
barrier, live East European col
lections r?nk first in use among
all Hoover Institution area col
lections.
The material on Russia partic
ularly attracts many scholars and
students to tlie Farm from other
campuses in this country and
from abroad. George Herman,
Professor Vernadsky, E. 11. Carr
and many other prominent au
thors of works oil Russian his
tory have made extensive use of
this collection.
The pre-eminence of the East
European area in current world

affairs emphasizes the impor
tance of the East European col
lections in the Hoover Institution
Their importance and use will cer
tainly grow in the near future.
