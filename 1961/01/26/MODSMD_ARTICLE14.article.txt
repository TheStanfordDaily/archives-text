Big Ski Weekend on Tap
IUGIIT NOW MANY Stanford students are getting their hoots,
parkas, stretch-pants, skis and poles together for the Farm's annual
trek to the snow the Stanford Winter Carnival.
This year's event promises to be as exciting as last year with bet
ter skiing facilities at ihe Olympic Village in Squaw Valley, scene of
last year's Winter Olympics.
One of the feature attractions at the Carnival this year will be
the open slalom race with its men and women, novice and advanced
divisions Saturday afternoon.
SKI KXCOM MilMBKK Bill Moffett informs us that the race will
consist of 25 gates and be directed by the ski team. Trophies will be
given out at the Snow Ball to be held that night at the California
Sports Center at Squaw which will incidently feature the Limelight
ers a currently popular folk-singing group from the City.
Perhaps now we should lake a look at the organizers of Saturday's
race the Stanford Ski Team. This group of avid skiers participates
for the school without any aid from the Athletic Department and
skis .just for the enjoyment of competition with neighboring schools
and such ski powerhouses as Den-

ver and Nevada universities.
TIIK TKAM IS composed of
John Beaupre and Moffett who
both ski in the Northwest when
not at Stanford, specializing in the
Alpine, or downhill, and slalom
events; Dutch Bansbach, a jumper
and Page Edwards, cross-country,
from Colorado; Kjell Hagberg,
from Norway, who skies in all
four events; Roger Crist, Don
Newman and Mike Hammer, all
Alpine specialists, and Pete Wit
ter, cross-country, who all ski
here in the Sierras.
The team usually plans to com
pete in four to six big races each
Winter quarter and always holds
its own among California schools.
Their first race was the North
ern California Inter-Collegiate In
vitational, Jan. 14, where the
team finished fourth.

Moffett led Stanford skiers with a second in the downhill event.
Newman, who has competed in NCAA competition grabbed a fourth
in the slalom; and Bansbaeh, an impressive finisher in the Junior
Nationals, came in third in jumping competition.
The team plans to be at lull strength for coming up races: the
Far West tournament at the Donner Ski ranch Feb. 4: the big Reno
Ski Carnival—where nearly all the powerful college ski teams will
compete the following weekend; and the Stanford-sponsored Ties
sider Cup races at Squaw Valley Feb. 25.
THIS WEEKEND, however, most of the members will be going
up to Squaw with the rest of us to enjoy tlie Winter Carnival.
Besides the race—which will be held 011 the Papoose chair run,
scene of the slalom events in the Olympics skating, swimming and
sleigh ride facilities will be open to all those lucky people up in the
valley.
Lucky is right because tickets for lodging at the Village went
quickly before Keg Day closed this quarter and the additional spaces
at Tahoe Vista- some fifteen minutes from Squaw wont soon after
wards.
This does not mean that only 650 students will be there this week
end because many will show for the festivities who have made other
arrangements for places to stay around the valley skiing area.
THE CARNIVAL COMMITTEE is encouraging all living groups
who are planning to attend in numbers, to enter the Saturday races
as a unit so that the top four finishers in a living group will be given
credit.
There Will Be Snow
Of course the big worry this season is lack of snow, for our good
weather has cut down the snow at all skiing resorts in the Sierras
and certainly most of them could use three or four more feet.
However, we have been informed that there is enough snow for
good skiing so to all lodge skiers—beware, because this might not
be too good an alibi to keep you off the slopes, away from your
skiing friends.
A SPECIAL HAND should go to the Ski Club ex-com who have
done a great job in organizing the festivities. Bob Mathewson, John
Steinhauser, Carol Langford, Pam Kertz and Fred Hodder all have
done a lot to make this Carnival a success.
So tomorrow should see a lot of skis on racks on cars moving out
of the Farm 1o the mountains where the sports conversation changes
from baskets and scores to waxes and Christies as Stanford goes to

Squaw

scene of the slalom events in the Olympics skating, swimming and
sleigh ride facilities will be open to all those lucky people up in the
valley.
Lucky is right because tickets for lodging at the Village went
quickly before Keg Day closed this quarter and the additional spaces
at Tahoe Vista- some fifteen minutes from Squaw wont soon after
wards.
This does not mean that only 650 students will be there this week
end because many will show for the festivities who have made other
arrangements for places to stay around the valley skiing area.
THE CARNIVAL COMMITTEE is encouraging all living groups
who are planning to attend in numbers, to enter the Saturday races
as a unit so that the top four finishers in a living group will be given
credit.
There Will Be Snow
Of course the big worry this season is lack of snow, for our good
weather has cut down the snow at all skiing resorts in the Sierras
and certainly most of them could use three or four more feet.
However, we have been informed that there is enough snow for
good skiing so to all lodge skiers—beware, because this might not
be too good an alibi to keep you off the slopes, away from your
skiing friends.
A SPECIAL HAND should go to the Ski Club ex-com who have
done a great job in organizing the festivities. Bob Mathewson, John
Steinhauser, Carol Langford, Pam Kertz and Fred Hodder all have
done a lot to make this Carnival a success.
So tomorrow should see a lot of skis on racks on cars moving out
of the Farm 1o the mountains where the sports conversation changes
from baskets and scores to waxes and Christies as Stanford goes to

Squaw

IUGIIT NOW MANY Stanford students are getting their hoots,
parkas, stretch-pants, skis and poles together for the Farm's annual
trek to the snow the Stanford Winter Carnival.
This year's event promises to be as exciting as last year with bet
ter skiing facilities at ihe Olympic Village in Squaw Valley, scene of
last year's Winter Olympics.
One of the feature attractions at the Carnival this year will be
the open slalom race with its men and women, novice and advanced
divisions Saturday afternoon.
SKI KXCOM MilMBKK Bill Moffett informs us that the race will
consist of 25 gates and be directed by the ski team. Trophies will be
given out at the Snow Ball to be held that night at the California
Sports Center at Squaw which will incidently feature the Limelight
ers a currently popular folk-singing group from the City.
Perhaps now we should lake a look at the organizers of Saturday's
race the Stanford Ski Team. This group of avid skiers participates
for the school without any aid from the Athletic Department and
skis .just for the enjoyment of competition with neighboring schools
and such ski powerhouses as Den-

ver and Nevada universities.
TIIK TKAM IS composed of
John Beaupre and Moffett who
both ski in the Northwest when
not at Stanford, specializing in the
Alpine, or downhill, and slalom
events; Dutch Bansbach, a jumper
and Page Edwards, cross-country,
from Colorado; Kjell Hagberg,
from Norway, who skies in all
four events; Roger Crist, Don
Newman and Mike Hammer, all
Alpine specialists, and Pete Wit
ter, cross-country, who all ski
here in the Sierras.
The team usually plans to com
pete in four to six big races each
Winter quarter and always holds
its own among California schools.
Their first race was the North
ern California Inter-Collegiate In
vitational, Jan. 14, where the
team finished fourth.

Moffett led Stanford skiers with a second in the downhill event.
Newman, who has competed in NCAA competition grabbed a fourth
in the slalom; and Bansbaeh, an impressive finisher in the Junior
Nationals, came in third in jumping competition.
The team plans to be at lull strength for coming up races: the
Far West tournament at the Donner Ski ranch Feb. 4: the big Reno
Ski Carnival—where nearly all the powerful college ski teams will
compete the following weekend; and the Stanford-sponsored Ties
sider Cup races at Squaw Valley Feb. 25.

for the school without any aid from the Athletic Department and
skis .just for the enjoyment of competition with neighboring schools
and such ski powerhouses as Den-

ver and Nevada universities.
TIIK TKAM IS composed of
John Beaupre and Moffett who
both ski in the Northwest when
not at Stanford, specializing in the
Alpine, or downhill, and slalom
events; Dutch Bansbach, a jumper
and Page Edwards, cross-country,
from Colorado; Kjell Hagberg,
from Norway, who skies in all
four events; Roger Crist, Don
Newman and Mike Hammer, all
Alpine specialists, and Pete Wit
ter, cross-country, who all ski
here in the Sierras.
The team usually plans to com
pete in four to six big races each
Winter quarter and always holds
its own among California schools.
Their first race was the North
ern California Inter-Collegiate In
vitational, Jan. 14, where the
team finished fourth.

Moffett led Stanford skiers with a second in the downhill event.
Newman, who has competed in NCAA competition grabbed a fourth
in the slalom; and Bansbaeh, an impressive finisher in the Junior
Nationals, came in third in jumping competition.
The team plans to be at lull strength for coming up races: the
Far West tournament at the Donner Ski ranch Feb. 4: the big Reno
Ski Carnival—where nearly all the powerful college ski teams will
compete the following weekend; and the Stanford-sponsored Ties
sider Cup races at Squaw Valley Feb. 25.
THIS WEEKEND, however, most of the members will be going
up to Squaw with the rest of us to enjoy tlie Winter Carnival.
Besides the race—which will be held 011 the Papoose chair run,
scene of the slalom events in the Olympics skating, swimming and
sleigh ride facilities will be open to all those lucky people up in the
valley.
Lucky is right because tickets for lodging at the Village went
quickly before Keg Day closed this quarter and the additional spaces
at Tahoe Vista- some fifteen minutes from Squaw wont soon after
wards.
This does not mean that only 650 students will be there this week
end because many will show for the festivities who have made other
arrangements for places to stay around the valley skiing area.
THE CARNIVAL COMMITTEE is encouraging all living groups
who are planning to attend in numbers, to enter the Saturday races
as a unit so that the top four finishers in a living group will be given
credit.
There Will Be Snow
Of course the big worry this season is lack of snow, for our good
weather has cut down the snow at all skiing resorts in the Sierras
and certainly most of them could use three or four more feet.
However, we have been informed that there is enough snow for
good skiing so to all lodge skiers—beware, because this might not
be too good an alibi to keep you off the slopes, away from your
skiing friends.
A SPECIAL HAND should go to the Ski Club ex-com who have
done a great job in organizing the festivities. Bob Mathewson, John
Steinhauser, Carol Langford, Pam Kertz and Fred Hodder all have
done a lot to make this Carnival a success.
So tomorrow should see a lot of skis on racks on cars moving out
of the Farm 1o the mountains where the sports conversation changes
from baskets and scores to waxes and Christies as Stanford goes to

Squaw
