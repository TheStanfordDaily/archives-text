# Bay Area Is Subject Of Current Art Show
## 
### 
The Bay Area is the subject of two current exhibits at the Art
Gallery: a collection of oils by Michele Cascella, and a series of photo
graphs entitled "Man's Impact on the Bay Area," by David Abegast
and Robert Tetlow.
Cascella appeared here last week in connection with a showing

of a color film of his paintings. I
Pie is now visiting this country as
an artist-in-residence at Montalvo,
the San Francisco Art Associa
tion's art center in Saratoga. His I
home is in Portofino, Italy.
HIS PAINTINGS reflect the!
span of his travels: Italy, France
and the West Coast. Three scenes
in this collection are from the
immediate area, two from Palo
Alto, and one of Ocean Beach in
San Francisco.
The same view of Ocean Beach
is the subject of one of the photo
graphs by Arbegast and Tetlow.
| Arbegast is a landscape architect
: in Berkeley, and Tetlow is an as
sistant professor in the Depart
ment of Landscape Architecture
at Cal.
Their photographs are meant to ;
demonstrate that "the landscape
I of the region of San Francisco,
| modeled and stamped by the wind,
| the sea, and the heavings of the
j earth in storm and sun, has a new !
! master."
The collection is divided into !
I sections entitled: "We need land I
—for living, for travel, for recre-1
I ation, and for dying;" "The open'
land is fast disappearing;" "The
Water's Edge;" and"The Hills
and Homes."
ASIDE FROM articulating the
j vast changes that have overcome
|the area from building homes,
| factories, roads, and wharves, and
■ from earthquakes and erosion,
! the photographs are works of art
in themselves.
Abegast and Tetlow have com
bined natural elements of sun-1
; light, mist, fog, and clouds with
| man-made forms of concrete j
bridges, highways, high-power j
lines, retaining walls, picket
fences, and fire-alarm boxes in
dramatic compositions.
Both exhibits are powerful in ,
themselves. Cascella's style is not;
entirely classic, not entirely post
impressionist, but extremely vital. 1
full of "happiness and optimism."
The juxtaposition of the work of
such a painter to that of the,
| Arbegast-Tetlow camera makes a j
j sharp contrast. This is especially
| evident in their interpretations of
Ocean Beach.

Ocean Beach.
The Bay Area is the subject of two current exhibits at the Art
Gallery: a collection of oils by Michele Cascella, and a series of photo
graphs entitled "Man's Impact on the Bay Area," by David Abegast
and Robert Tetlow.
Cascella appeared here last week in connection with a showing

of a color film of his paintings. I
Pie is now visiting this country as
an artist-in-residence at Montalvo,
the San Francisco Art Associa
tion's art center in Saratoga. His I
home is in Portofino, Italy.
HIS PAINTINGS reflect the!
span of his travels: Italy, France
and the West Coast. Three scenes
in this collection are from the
immediate area, two from Palo
Alto, and one of Ocean Beach in
San Francisco.
The same view of Ocean Beach
is the subject of one of the photo
graphs by Arbegast and Tetlow.
| Arbegast is a landscape architect
: in Berkeley, and Tetlow is an as
sistant professor in the Depart
ment of Landscape Architecture
at Cal.
Their photographs are meant to ;
demonstrate that "the landscape
I of the region of San Francisco,
| modeled and stamped by the wind,
| the sea, and the heavings of the
j earth in storm and sun, has a new !
! master."
The collection is divided into !
I sections entitled: "We need land I
—for living, for travel, for recre-1
I ation, and for dying;" "The open'
land is fast disappearing;" "The
Water's Edge;" and"The Hills
and Homes."
ASIDE FROM articulating the
j vast changes that have overcome
|the area from building homes,
| factories, roads, and wharves, and
■ from earthquakes and erosion,
! the photographs are works of art
in themselves.
Abegast and Tetlow have com
bined natural elements of sun-1
; light, mist, fog, and clouds with
| man-made forms of concrete j
bridges, highways, high-power j
lines, retaining walls, picket
fences, and fire-alarm boxes in
dramatic compositions.
Both exhibits are powerful in ,
themselves. Cascella's style is not;
entirely classic, not entirely post
impressionist, but extremely vital. 1
full of "happiness and optimism."
The juxtaposition of the work of
such a painter to that of the,
| Arbegast-Tetlow camera makes a j
j sharp contrast. This is especially
