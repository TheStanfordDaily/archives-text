# Stanford â€™Is More Responsible' In World, National Obligations
## 
### JUDY SEABORG 
Stanford, as well as other major
universities in the United States,
has "moved out it its ivory tower
. . . and become more serious,
more responsive, and more re
sponsible" in regards to its obli
gations and contributions to the
nation and to the world, agreed a
panel consisting of Deans Philip
H. Rhinelander and I. James
Quillen, Philosophy Professor
John Mothershead, and Dr. Robert
J. Wert, vice-provost, last night
in Cubberley Auditorium.
The discussion, "Stanford Uni
versity and National Purpose,"
was the final event in the Politi
cal Union's "Focus" program,
which has been carried out this
week.
DR. WERT commented upon
the changes in the nation and in
the University since World War
11. Organized research, of which
there was little before the war, is
extensive at Stanford and "con
tributes directly to the defense ]
effort and therefore to national
purpose."
Professor Mothershead sug
gested that national purpose
consisted of extending freedom
into the world and teaching other
peoples to help themselves. "The
role of Stanford," he said, is to
produce men who are not inter
changeable in the world and who
who are not tranquillized."
DEAN QUILLEN felt that "ed
ucation is a major instrument in
tho development of the individual
and the service of the nation." He
felt that Stanford was making
great contributions in the field of
languages with its language lab,
overseas campuses, intensive de
partmental study, and co-opera
tion with foreign universities such
as the University of Tokyo. He
added that Stanford and other
major universities, "have become
centers of study for foreign stu
dents."
DKAN KHINELANDER, dean
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, discussed the contribu
butions of the generalist, who is j
essential to American society "be-1
cause our purpose must lie leader
ship in the world without domina
tion."
The panelists agreed thai Stan
ford's aim must be to prepare iis j
students not only to adjust to
society, but to make a creative
contribution to it.

PANEL DISCUSSES STANFORD AND NATIONAL PURPOSES
Professor John Mothershead. Vice-Provost Robert Wert and Deans Philip Rhinelander and
Isaac Quillen are participants on panel.
Stanford, as well as other major
universities in the United States,
has "moved out it its ivory tower
. . . and become more serious,
more responsive, and more re
sponsible" in regards to its obli
gations and contributions to the
nation and to the world, agreed a
panel consisting of Deans Philip
H. Rhinelander and I. James
Quillen, Philosophy Professor
John Mothershead, and Dr. Robert
J. Wert, vice-provost, last night
in Cubberley Auditorium.
The discussion, "Stanford Uni
versity and National Purpose,"
was the final event in the Politi
cal Union's "Focus" program,
which has been carried out this
week.
DR. WERT commented upon
the changes in the nation and in
the University since World War
11. Organized research, of which
there was little before the war, is
extensive at Stanford and "con
tributes directly to the defense ]
effort and therefore to national
purpose."
Professor Mothershead sug
gested that national purpose
consisted of extending freedom
into the world and teaching other
peoples to help themselves. "The
role of Stanford," he said, is to
produce men who are not inter
changeable in the world and who
who are not tranquillized."
DEAN QUILLEN felt that "ed
ucation is a major instrument in
tho development of the individual
and the service of the nation." He
felt that Stanford was making
great contributions in the field of
languages with its language lab,
overseas campuses, intensive de
partmental study, and co-opera
