# U.S. Airmen Released After Russian Captivity
## 
### 
AMSTERDAM (UPI) â€” Two American airmen held captive by
the Russians since their R847 reconnaissance plane was shot down
last July 1 have been released and are on their way back home.
Capts. John R. McKone and Freeman B. Olmstead arrived in Am
sterdam yesterday from Moscow following their release from seven

months in a Soviet prison.
The RB-47 pilots changed planes
to a U.S. Air Force Constellation
and left 20 hours later for the
United States.
The men were freed by Russia
in a conciliatory gesture to the
Ken 11 ed y administration after
being held since last July, when
their plane was shot down over
the Barents Sea.
THE KBIT WAS shot down over
the Barents Sea after taking off
on its mission from England. The
Russians claimed the piano was
over Soviet, territory, and the
United States said it was over in
ternational waters.
At the time, the Russians indi
cated that both men would go on
trial, similar to U2 pilot Francis
Gary Powers who was sentenced
to 10 years detention.
But when no trial was held,
there was speculation that Khru
shchev might be holding it up pur
posely in order to extend an olive
branch to the Kennedy Admin
istration by announcing their re
lease.
There were also indications that
the Russians were finding more
legal difficulties involved in the
case of Olmstead and McKone
than they en c o un tore d with
Powers.
THE RELEASE of the men was
announced in Washington and
Moscow. Tass, the official Soviet
news agency, said they were
freed after being relieved from
"criminal liability."
President Kennedy told a news
conference there would be no re
sumption of U.S. reconnaissance
flights over the Soviet Union.
Asked if the release of the U.S.
fliers would mean any change in
prospects for a meeting between
him and Khrushchev, Kennedy
Therefore there are no plans
for a meeting with Mr. Khru
shchev.
