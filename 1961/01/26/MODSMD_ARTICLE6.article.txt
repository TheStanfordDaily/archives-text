# Gilby Praises Christian Unity
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Rev. Tomas Gilby, 0.P., believes
that there is no reason why all
Christians cannot agree in their
fundamental faith. "If our foun
dations are the same, it dosen't
matter how the building goes up."
he said yesterday afternoon in
Cubberley Auditorium.
"By Christian unity I do not
mean unity be one monolithic
state," he explained. "1 mean a
unity based first on love, then
on faith, and then on doctrine.
For heaven's sake I hope it is
not a unity of discipline."
"LKT'S HOI'E I his movement
tow a r d convcrsation between
Christians will continue," Father
Gilby said in speaking about the
recent meeting between the Pope
and the Archbishop of Canter
bury.
The Dominican priest has defi
nite ideas about the approach
which should be taken toward
Christian unity. "The happiest re
sults come when people are speak
ing from their strength. Other
wise you gel a good mannered
compromise," he said.
FATHER GILBY believes I haf
what is really needed is that "Re
ligious men of good will and harsh
convictions should talk together."
The Student Council of Re
ligious Affairs sponsored Father
Gilby's talk, which was titled
"The Roman Catholic Church and
Christian Unity." It was espe
cially appropriate for yesterday,
which was I lie last day of the
Week of Prayer for Christian
Unity.
