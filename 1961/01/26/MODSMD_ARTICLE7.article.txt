# Alpha Tau Omega Defies National
## Chapter Will Go Local If Charter Suspended 
### MAYNARD PARKER Managing Editor 
Copyright January 26, 1961, by The Stanford Daily
The Stanford chapter of Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity will face
possible revocation of its charter by the national organization as a
result of its pledging four Jewish men in last spring's rush, The
Daily learned yesterday.
The national, in a closed alumni hearing set for Saturday after
noon at Rickey's Studio Inn, will

charge the chapter with a viola
tion of the fraternity's l-eligion
and race clause plus other con
stitutional failures.
DEAN OF MEN William G.
Craig said lhat he "would back
the chapter all of the way."
Craig noted that if the ATO's
depledged the three sophomores
and one junior he could take dis
ciplinary action as a violation of
a March, 1957 University ruling
against racial and religious dis
crimination clauses in fraternity
charters.
Craig made clear that the ad
ministration has not pressured
the chapter because of this ruling.
"The stand was made by the
ATO," he said.
Caught in the middle, ATO
President Mike Kavanaugh said.
"The chances are that we will
probably lose our charter because
we don't intend to depledge these
men."
KAVANAUGH said the chapter
will go local if the national sus
pends them.
He emphasized "that ATO has
in no way been pressured or
pushed by the administration into
taking this stand."
"Alpha Tau Omega has and will
continue in the future to choose
men on the basis of personal at
tributes because we feel they will
be an asset, to the fraternity, re
gardless of race, color, or creed,"
he said.
He acknowledged that the local
has received many letters of sup
port for their case from other
ATO chapters.
THE ATO NATIONAL, in simi
lar action of December, 1959. re
voked the charter of the Dart
mouth College chapter over the
religious cause.
Craig warned that the national
officers may "drop the Jewish
charge and kick-out the local with
some trumped-up charge over
some ritualistic matter.
"If the publicity becomes too
great, the national may be forced
into this tactic," he said.
He also cited three other Stan
ford fraternities with religious
and/or racial clauses that "will
have to get rid of it."
They are Delta Tau Delta,
Sigma Chi and Kappa Alpha.
ACTION LEADING to the hear
ing began this summer when ATO
High Council Chairman Hubert
Garrecht issued an ultimatum to
the chapter to depledge three
Jewish men which they had
pledged in spring rush and one
Jewish carry-over pledge.
The chapter refused in a series
of letters and in personal talks
with fraternity field representa
tives.
The national then charged the
chapter, in a Jan. 4 letter by High
Council Secretary R. Ernest Brod
crick which was sent to all alumni
active members of the chapter,
with four specific charges:
It "Refusal to depledge four
men who failed to meet the fra
ternity membership requirements.
2> "Repeatedly pledged and ini
tiated men without disclosure to
Province Chief those not qualified
under Constitution and Laws.
31 "Complete chapter indiffer
ence toward compliance with the
Fraternity's m ember ship and
other constitutional requirements,
4> "Failure to report 19 men
initiated Nov. 2. 1958, until Jan.
22. 1959, with a final adjustment
and correction being received i
Feb. 2. 1959. bui were nul reported
until Oct. 16, 1959." '

The Stanford chapter of Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity will face
possible revocation of its charter by the national organization as a
result of its pledging four Jewish men in last spring's rush, The
Daily learned yesterday.
The national, in a closed alumni hearing set for Saturday after
noon at Rickey's Studio Inn, will

charge the chapter with a viola
tion of the fraternity's l-eligion
and race clause plus other con
stitutional failures.
DEAN OF MEN William G.
Craig said lhat he "would back
the chapter all of the way."
Craig noted that if the ATO's
depledged the three sophomores
and one junior he could take dis
ciplinary action as a violation of
a March, 1957 University ruling
against racial and religious dis
crimination clauses in fraternity
charters.
Craig made clear that the ad
ministration has not pressured
the chapter because of this ruling.
"The stand was made by the
ATO," he said.
Caught in the middle, ATO
President Mike Kavanaugh said.
"The chances are that we will
probably lose our charter because
we don't intend to depledge these
men."
KAVANAUGH said the chapter
will go local if the national sus
pends them.
He emphasized "that ATO has
in no way been pressured or
pushed by the administration into
taking this stand."
"Alpha Tau Omega has and will
continue in the future to choose
men on the basis of personal at
tributes because we feel they will
be an asset, to the fraternity, re
gardless of race, color, or creed,"
he said.
He acknowledged that the local
has received many letters of sup
port for their case from other
ATO chapters.
THE ATO NATIONAL, in simi
lar action of December, 1959. re
voked the charter of the Dart
mouth College chapter over the
religious cause.
Craig warned that the national
officers may "drop the Jewish
charge and kick-out the local with
some trumped-up charge over
some ritualistic matter.
