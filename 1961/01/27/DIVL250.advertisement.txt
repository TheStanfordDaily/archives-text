The John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science at General Dynamics* General Atomic Division
in San Diego, California, is a modern center of research and development, where new ideas and techniques ara
vigorously pursued. Here, strong engineering and development activities are matched with broad basic theoret*
ical and experimental research to create an ideal environment for productive efforts in the nuclear field.
Here, advanced work is underway on the High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), which promises to be a
major short cut to the nation's goal of economic nuclear power. The prototype HTGR plant will be constructed
by 1963 for Philadelphia Electric Company and High Temperature Reactor Development Associates, Inc.
Here, engineers and scientists work in a creative atmosphere on other advanced programs, Including the MGCf?
gas-cooled reactor and closed-cycle gas turbine system for merchant ship propulsion •• • TRIGA reactors for
training, research, and isotope production, which are now being installed on five continents • • • small nuclear
power systems.. • test reactors ... nuclear power for space vehicles • •«thermoelectricity •• • controlled ther
monuclear reactions.
Rapid expansion of these programs has led to increased engineering activity and created Openings for men, pre*
ferably at the graduate level, who seek a high degree of individual responsibility coUpted with unusual opportunities
to demonstrate their initiative and ability.
Nuclear Engineers, Metallurgists, Ceramists, Mathematicians • Programmers, and Experimental and Theoretical
physicists are invited to consider opportunities now existing in varied program areas. Please contact thcr pla e«
tnent office to arrange an appointment with the General Atomic representative Who Will ba at yQUT Campus on
