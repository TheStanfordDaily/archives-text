# INTERVIEW REFUSED
## President to Greet Released U.S. Fliers 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI> President Kennedy decided yesterday to
personally welcome home the two U.S. airmen whose release from
a Russian prison could signal a change for the better in the cold
war climate.
At the same time, the White House banned interviews with the

j men, Capts. John R. McKone and
' Freeman B. Olmstead, when they
i arrive here today for a snow-
I storm-delayed reunion with their
; wives. Press Secretary Pierre
| Salinger said this was a State De
■ partment decision "in the best in
j terests" of U.S.-Soviet relations.
This was in line with Kennedy's
news c on 112 e r ence statement
Wednesday that their freedom re
! moved a "serious obstacle" to bet
. ter relations with Russia. It ap
: parently underscored a U.S. de
■ termination not to endanger what
ever chance there may be of a
| cold war thaw.
ItUT EVEN while McKone and
Olmstead rested overnight in
, Goose Bay. Labrador, there were
j the beginnings of a storm on
' Capitol Hill over whether the
men were released in any kind of
secret "deal" with the Soviets.
Sen. Styles Bridges. R-N.11.,
Chairman of the GOP Policy Com
mittee. told the Senate that Ken-
I nedy "didn't make it clear
whether there was anything of
i fered Russia—or promised in re
turn." He urged that Kennedy
clear up the question because it
j "seriously concerns" the nation.
When the Russians confirmed
1 McCone's and Olmstead's release,
they noted that a ban on U2 spy
plane flights had been continued
by Kennedy. Asked at his news
conference if there had been any
"deal," the President replied it
"is a fact" he had extended the
ban continued on U2 flights.
OTHER SENATORS said Rus
sia should not receive credit for
releasing the men since they were
shot down originally in an unpro
voked attack over the Barents Sea
international waters.
An Air Force officer accom
panying them said both men
I "looked well but were pretty dead
beat and fatigued from the excite-
I ment." In fact, he said, they were
jso excited about their freedom
i that they couldn't eat on the
: plane when they left Amsterdam.
In a related development, the
i State Department announced that
Russia had sent a note Wednes
day disclaiming any knowledge
about 11 crewmembers of an Air
Force Cl3O which was shot down
! in 1948 over Soviet Armenia.
OF THE 17 men aboard that
plane, the Russians have returned
I six bodies. A recent East German
I magazine article indicated the
other 11 were still alive, and the
J U.S. government asked the So
viets for "clarification" of the
! report.
State Department spokesman
Lincoln White said the Russian
j note continued to deny any knowl
i edge of the missing men.
