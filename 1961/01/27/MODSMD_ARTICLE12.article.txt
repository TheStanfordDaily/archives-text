(Editor's Note: This is the third

the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace. Today's
article is on the Western Euro
pean Collection.)
BY AGNES F. PETERSON
Curator, Western
European Collection
This collection covers fourteen
c o un t r ie s: France, Germany
(both East and West), the Bene
lux countries, Italy, Spain and
Portugal, the Scandinavian coun
tries and Finland, Austria and
Switzerland, as well as a number
of supra-national organizations,
such as the European Commun
ity, the Council of Europe, the
Nordic Council and NATO.
Historically the oldest and larg
est collection is the one on Ger
many. It starts in 1870 and ex
tends through Empire, World
War I, Revolution, Weimar Re
public and the Nazi State to cur
rent events in both East and West
Germany.
The period of World War T is
particularly well covered from
official to private memoir. Mate
rials on the German revolution
are comprehensive, as is the sec
tion on the National Socialist
state from 1933-1945. Law and
statutes, party directives, official
publications, supplemented by
newspapers, p e r i o d i c a 1 s, and
memoirs reveal an inside view of
Nazi Germany in peace and war.
The Library is fortunate in hav
ing the original wartime diaries
of the mass propagandist, Josef
Goebbels, which show that he by
no means fooled himself. A fasci
nating sidelight on the personal
ity of Heinrich Himmler, the chief
of the Gestapo, can be gained
from six recently acquired diary
notebooks kept by Himmler as
a boy and young man, in which
are recorded with fussy and meti
culous care his visits to church
and his dates with young Munich
ladies.
To round out its collection, the
Library recently obtained 150
reels of microfilms covering the
entire files of the Nazi Party
Main Archives. In them may be
found, in addition to records go
ing back to the party's early years
of tribulation after World War I,
some of Hitler's personal papers,
such as his family tree and repro
ductions of his watercolors and
sketches.
The aftermath of this period
of violence can also be followed
in detail in the Library's docu
mentation of denazification and
Allied military occupation. For
present-day Germany interest cen
ters on the East-West controversy
and the growth of two widely
divergent political, economic and

social systems within a previously
unified country. The "Hoover Li
brary Collection Survey No. 2."
prepared by Mrs. 11. K. Boenin
ger, gives a thorough and much
more complete guide.
The next largest and important
collect ion is the one on France.
The periods of World War I and
II are well covcred in newspapers,
periodicals, underground publica
tions, memoirs, and court records.
Particularly noteworthy is a
collection of French underground
materials containing directives to
receive airdrops, etc. Since the
Fr en c h authorities themselves
could not locate all the original
documents, they requested per
mission to micro-film iho entire
collection for their use.
To fill the most serious gaps
in the French collection of the
1920's and 30's, we are in the
process of acquiring on micro
film, with the generous help of
the Stanford History Department,
files of important newspapers
(such as the Socialist "Le Popu
late") and weeklies (Candide,
Gringiore). Current political de
velopments, particularly the Al
gerian conflict, are also covered.
Strong points in the Italian col
lection are documents on the Fas
cist regime and material from the
underground movements, particu
larly the partisans in Northern
Italy. This interesting material
formed the basis for a study by
Charles Delzell: "Mussolini's Ene
mies, the Anti-F a s c is t Resist
ance." Spain is represented by a
large, varied and valuable collec
tion 011 all aspects of the Spanish
Civil War.
Interest in Belgium and, by ex
tension, in the Benelux countries,
has its roots in Mr. Hoover's early
relief rehabilitation work in that
country, and events are followed
closely. The main emphasis is on
government documents, under
ground publications in World War
I and II (for instance the Library
has a complete file of "La Libre
Belgique"), and Belgium's partici
pation in the European Commun
ity. There is also a special col
lection on the Royal Crisis in 19-48.
Hitherto unexploited and newly
acquirer! source material offers
research possibilities in nearly all
areas. The following list is by no
means exhaustive and is meant
only to suggest a few topics: The
growth of the European Commun
ity; comparison of various under
ground movements; early Nazi
party history; a re-examination
of the Spanish Civil War; four
power occupation of Austria; par
ty history of the Mouvement Re
publicain Populaire; French poli
cies in Algeria; re-evaluation of
the German reunification prob
lem.

tends through Empire, World
War I, Revolution, Weimar Re
public and the Nazi State to cur
rent events in both East and West
Germany.
The period of World War T is
particularly well covered from
official to private memoir. Mate
rials on the German revolution
are comprehensive, as is the sec
tion on the National Socialist
state from 1933-1945. Law and
statutes, party directives, official
publications, supplemented by
newspapers, p e r i o d i c a 1 s, and
memoirs reveal an inside view of
Nazi Germany in peace and war.
The Library is fortunate in hav
ing the original wartime diaries
of the mass propagandist, Josef
Goebbels, which show that he by
no means fooled himself. A fasci
nating sidelight on the personal
ity of Heinrich Himmler, the chief
of the Gestapo, can be gained
from six recently acquired diary
notebooks kept by Himmler as
a boy and young man, in which
are recorded with fussy and meti
culous care his visits to church
and his dates with young Munich
ladies.
To round out its collection, the
Library recently obtained 150
reels of microfilms covering the
entire files of the Nazi Party
Main Archives. In them may be
found, in addition to records go
ing back to the party's early years
of tribulation after World War I,
some of Hitler's personal papers,
such as his family tree and repro
ductions of his watercolors and
sketches.
The aftermath of this period
of violence can also be followed
in detail in the Library's docu
mentation of denazification and
Allied military occupation. For
present-day Germany interest cen
ters on the East-West controversy
and the growth of two widely
divergent political, economic and

social systems within a previously
unified country. The "Hoover Li
brary Collection Survey No. 2."
prepared by Mrs. 11. K. Boenin
ger, gives a thorough and much
more complete guide.
The next largest and important
collect ion is the one on France.
The periods of World War I and
II are well covcred in newspapers,
periodicals, underground publica
tions, memoirs, and court records.
Particularly noteworthy is a
collection of French underground
materials containing directives to
receive airdrops, etc. Since the
Fr en c h authorities themselves
could not locate all the original
documents, they requested per
mission to micro-film iho entire
collection for their use.
To fill the most serious gaps
in the French collection of the
1920's and 30's, we are in the
process of acquiring on micro
film, with the generous help of
the Stanford History Department,
files of important newspapers
(such as the Socialist "Le Popu
late") and weeklies (Candide,
Gringiore). Current political de
velopments, particularly the Al
gerian conflict, are also covered.
Strong points in the Italian col
lection are documents on the Fas
cist regime and material from the
underground movements, particu
larly the partisans in Northern
Italy. This interesting material
formed the basis for a study by
Charles Delzell: "Mussolini's Ene
mies, the Anti-F a s c is t Resist
ance." Spain is represented by a
large, varied and valuable collec
tion 011 all aspects of the Spanish
Civil War.
Interest in Belgium and, by ex
tension, in the Benelux countries,
has its roots in Mr. Hoover's early
relief rehabilitation work in that
country, and events are followed
closely. The main emphasis is on
government documents, under
ground publications in World War
I and II (for instance the Library
has a complete file of "La Libre
Belgique"), and Belgium's partici
pation in the European Commun
ity. There is also a special col
lection on the Royal Crisis in 19-48.
Hitherto unexploited and newly
acquirer! source material offers
research possibilities in nearly all
areas. The following list is by no
means exhaustive and is meant
only to suggest a few topics: The
growth of the European Commun
ity; comparison of various under
ground movements; early Nazi
party history; a re-examination
of the Spanish Civil War; four
power occupation of Austria; par
ty history of the Mouvement Re
publicain Populaire; French poli
cies in Algeria; re-evaluation of
the German reunification prob
lem.

no means fooled himself. A fasci
nating sidelight on the personal
ity of Heinrich Himmler, the chief
of the Gestapo, can be gained
from six recently acquired diary
notebooks kept by Himmler as
a boy and young man, in which
are recorded with fussy and meti
culous care his visits to church
and his dates with young Munich
ladies.
To round out its collection, the
Library recently obtained 150
reels of microfilms covering the
entire files of the Nazi Party
Main Archives. In them may be
found, in addition to records go
ing back to the party's early years
of tribulation after World War I,
some of Hitler's personal papers,
such as his family tree and repro
ductions of his watercolors and
sketches.
The aftermath of this period
of violence can also be followed
in detail in the Library's docu
mentation of denazification and
Allied military occupation. For
present-day Germany interest cen
ters on the East-West controversy
and the growth of two widely
divergent political, economic and

social systems within a previously
unified country. The "Hoover Li
brary Collection Survey No. 2."
prepared by Mrs. 11. K. Boenin
ger, gives a thorough and much
more complete guide.
The next largest and important
collect ion is the one on France.
The periods of World War I and
II are well covcred in newspapers,
periodicals, underground publica
tions, memoirs, and court records.
Particularly noteworthy is a
collection of French underground
materials containing directives to
receive airdrops, etc. Since the
Fr en c h authorities themselves
could not locate all the original
documents, they requested per
mission to micro-film iho entire
collection for their use.
To fill the most serious gaps
in the French collection of the
1920's and 30's, we are in the
process of acquiring on micro
film, with the generous help of
the Stanford History Department,
files of important newspapers
(such as the Socialist "Le Popu
late") and weeklies (Candide,
Gringiore). Current political de
velopments, particularly the Al
gerian conflict, are also covered.
Strong points in the Italian col
lection are documents on the Fas
cist regime and material from the
underground movements, particu
larly the partisans in Northern
Italy. This interesting material
formed the basis for a study by
Charles Delzell: "Mussolini's Ene
mies, the Anti-F a s c is t Resist
ance." Spain is represented by a
large, varied and valuable collec
tion 011 all aspects of the Spanish
Civil War.
Interest in Belgium and, by ex
tension, in the Benelux countries,
has its roots in Mr. Hoover's early
relief rehabilitation work in that
country, and events are followed
closely. The main emphasis is on
government documents, under
ground publications in World War
I and II (for instance the Library
has a complete file of "La Libre
Belgique"), and Belgium's partici
pation in the European Commun
ity. There is also a special col
lection on the Royal Crisis in 19-48.
Hitherto unexploited and newly
acquirer! source material offers
research possibilities in nearly all
areas. The following list is by no
means exhaustive and is meant
only to suggest a few topics: The
growth of the European Commun
ity; comparison of various under
ground movements; early Nazi
party history; a re-examination
of the Spanish Civil War; four
power occupation of Austria; par
ty history of the Mouvement Re
publicain Populaire; French poli
cies in Algeria; re-evaluation of
the German reunification prob
lem.

European Collection
This collection covers fourteen
c o un t r ie s: France, Germany
(both East and West), the Bene
lux countries, Italy, Spain and
Portugal, the Scandinavian coun
tries and Finland, Austria and
Switzerland, as well as a number
of supra-national organizations,
such as the European Commun
ity, the Council of Europe, the
Nordic Council and NATO.
Historically the oldest and larg
est collection is the one on Ger
many. It starts in 1870 and ex
tends through Empire, World
War I, Revolution, Weimar Re
public and the Nazi State to cur
rent events in both East and West
Germany.
The period of World War T is
particularly well covered from
official to private memoir. Mate
rials on the German revolution
are comprehensive, as is the sec
tion on the National Socialist
state from 1933-1945. Law and
statutes, party directives, official
publications, supplemented by
newspapers, p e r i o d i c a 1 s, and
memoirs reveal an inside view of
Nazi Germany in peace and war.
The Library is fortunate in hav
ing the original wartime diaries
of the mass propagandist, Josef
Goebbels, which show that he by
