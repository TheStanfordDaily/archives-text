Editor, the Daily: •
What ails Ihe Chappie?
The lastest issue (which some
body dared to put on sale re
cently) is lousy. Really lousy. I
moan LOUSY. No spark in it (de
spite the pretensions of the fiery
cover), no verve (the Old Boy
sounds like the Old Mare), no
spice (you call those things
jokes?), no—nothing. Just a bale
of bland blah blowing behind a
billowy and bloated banality.
What ails the Chappie?
One: The Chaparral is supposed
to be the Stanford humor maga
zine. It isn't. Why? There's no
humor in it. (Which is obvious
to you and me—but we've got to
make it crystal clear to those
hammer and coffin boys.)
Two: The Chaparral has too
much advertising. Do you realize
that you paid (you didn't?—you
were lucky!) forty cents for
eleven pages entirely devoted to
advertising; plus nine pages in
which two-thirds of the page is
devoted to advertising; plus ads
on the inside front and back cov
ers; plus advertising on the out
side cover.
To put it simply (again, we
have to pamper these Chappie

112 people) you and T are paying a
penny a page for what?-- for
twenty pages of advertising.
Heck, we can pet better ads, more
of 'em, with music and talking
and animation, on TV and for
free, too!
To put it more simply (or gross
ly, for our Chappie friends), you
and I are only getting half of
our money's worth. It'd be toler
: able, or at least different, if the
, ads were funny. Then we wouldn't
I get so sick of seeing the same
l old ads month after month. But
the ads are NOT funny. And whal
is worse, the Chappies haven't
even attempted to make them
funny. Not even "sick-funny," like
they used to he. This sad deteri
oration augurs ill for the gloomy
and all-too-distant future.
Let's face it: the Old Boy is
dead. Expired. Given up the ghost.
Probably the best thing lhat could
, happen to the Old Thing would
| be to fadfe away, gentle-like,
without a trace. Then the only
thing we'd miss would be the bad
taste. A happier memory would
remain. And the Old Boy would
not have to suffer the indignity
of the current issue of The Stan
ford Chaparral.
