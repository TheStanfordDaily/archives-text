of Cal Poly. Murphy was hindered
throughout most of the match
by a bloody nose. The win turned
out to be the last of the night for
Cal Poly.
In tho 167-lb. division Stanford's
Frank Medio won a decision from
Ilalley Herbert. Redle almost
pinned Herbert in the second
period but Herbert prolonged the
match by wiggling out of bounds.
The closeness of the meet is
shown by the fact that had Redle
managed to get tho pin Stanford
would have picked up the two
points necessary to tie.
STANFORD finished out the
night with two pins. In the 177-lb.
division Dick Denny pinned John
Lillis in the third period.
Heavyweight Dun can Ross
wrestled an outstanding match
and pinned Bill Graham of Cal
Poly with only 1:08 gone in the
first period to finish out the meet.
