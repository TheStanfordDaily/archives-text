## Pirate Ship May Sail to Showdown 
### 
SAN JUAN. Puerto Rico (UPIi
Food and water is being rationed
on the hijacked liner Santa Maria
but the 42 Americans among the
620 hostage passengers are well,
a radio message from the ship
said yesterday.
The rebel captain of the Santa
Maria was sailing resolutely to
ward Africa and a possible show
down with the Portuguese gov
ernment despite pleas by the U.S.
Navy that he discharge the pas
sengers at a South American port.
THE SHIP was being followed
by the nuclear submarine Seawolf
which expects to make a mid-
Atlantic rendezvous to m or r o w
night and was being tracked night
and day by Navy planes. U.S. sub
marines were converging on it
from Puerto Rico and Africa.
A message yesterday from
five Americans to the Columbia
Broadcasting System was the first
hint of any privation among the
passengers. Previous radiograms
1o relatives said only they were
safe and well. The ship had been
thought to have enough food and
fuel for 20 more days.
U.S. NAVY headquarters in San
Juan reported last night the ship's
course was unchanged â€” it was
sailing straight toward the big
Portuguese colony of Angola on
the southern coast of Africa.
The leader of the men who cap
turcd the Santa Maria. Henrique
Galavo, might expect a sympa
thetic reception in Angola. He
once was the Portuguese army's
inspector there. He was relieved
of his post after he made a report
criticizing the government.
In Sao Paulo, Brazil, Portuguese
rebel leader Gen. Nymberto Del
gado cabled President Kennedy to
"request that even the simple U.S.
Navy surveillance of the Santa
Maria be canceled because it de
stroys the necessary secrecy of
the ship's movements."
(DEEGAOO, defeated candidate
for the Portuguese presidency,
made his plea to Kennedy as "an
exiled colleague, former NATO
representative, air and military
attache in Washington, and old
friend." >
Adm. Robert L. Dennison, com
mander-in-chief of the U.S. Atlan
tic Fleet at Norfolk, Va.. sent a
plea to the rebel leader, Portu
guese ex-Capt. Henrique Galvao
who seized the ship early Sunday
in the Caribbean in a 10 minute
"revolution."
"Request you proceed any port
northern South America you
choose to discharge passengers,"
the admiral -said. "Please advise
port selected and time arrival.
Will attempt to arrange confer
once aboard Santa Maria as you
request."
