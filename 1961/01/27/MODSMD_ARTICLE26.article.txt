activity at Sala Phou Khoun.
A Laotian military officer said
the government might drop para
troops behind the Pathet Lao de
fenders of Sala Phou Khoun to
cut them off from retreating to
the Plain of Jars. This also would
cut off their supplies, still being
flown in to the plain by Russian
aircraft.
THE PILOT reported a convoy
of 20 trucks heading toward Sala
Phou Khoun from the plain.
The government drive north
ward from Vientiane toward Lu
ang Prabang, 140 miles to the
north, was stalled briefly for lack
of supplies. But American civi
lian pilots bringing in supplies re
sumed landing at Vang Vieng, 65
miles north of Vientiane.
