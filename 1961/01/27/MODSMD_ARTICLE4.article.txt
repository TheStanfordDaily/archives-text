## Library Hours To Be Extended In February 
### 
An experimental change in elos-;
ing hours for the Main Library
and Western Civilization Library
will go into effect Feb. 6 for the
duration of winter quarter, it was
announced at last night's Legisla
ture meeting.
Starting that Monday, the Re-j
serve Book Room, Humanities I
Room, Social Sciences Room and
the loan desk and stacks will stay !
open until 11 p.m., Sunday
through Friday.
THE Civ libe will remain open
to 10:15 p.m. Sunday through
Friday under the new hours. That
library also will not close until
,"5:30 p.m. Saturday, an extension
of its current 9 a.m.-noon Satur
day hours.
Under the change, the entire
Main Library building will lock
its doors at 5 p.m. Saturday. Pres
ently, the RBR stays open until
10 p.m. Saturday.
The change effects closing
hours only. The paging service
for the stacks and the fine-paying j
services of the Main Library will j
not, however, be available after
10 p.m.
THE MOVE came after a LAS
SU committee had looked into the
closing hours. A resolution adopt
ed at last week's LASSU meeting
authorized Women's .Row Repre
sentative Mary Griffing, who
worked closely with library offi
cials on the matter, to ask for ex
tension of RBR and Civ libe
hours.
Miss Griffing consulted the li
brarians, who came up with the
planâ€”made possible through sav-1
ings in funds for staff salaries
which, for various reasons, will
not be needed.
Results of the experiment will
be studied during spring vacation
to determine whether to continue
the new policy. Miss Griffing said i
library officials emphasized that j
misuse of facilities or books un
der the new hours will mean aj
return to the old.
