a discussion held at Women's
Clubhouse last night on "The
Jews in the Russian Revolution."

The Honorable Alexander Ke
rensky. Prime Minister of Russia
in the eventful summer of 1917.
answered questions by Mazour
and director of Stanford Hillel
and contemporary Jewish scholar,
Dr. Howard M. Sachar.
INTRODUCING the topic of
anti-Semitism was a query to Ke
rensky by Sachar. "Is Russia's
present anti-Semitism artificial,
or is this racism inherent to the
Russian people?"
"A state or nation, as such has
no right to make a distinction be
tween citizens. They must have
equal rights in soiial, economical,
political, and religious matters.
This was the feeling held not only
by the radicals in Russia during
my period in the Dnma. hut the
honest conservatives as well," Ke
rensky replied forcibly.
"We believed the state must be
equal for all. Only in count l ies
where this important policy exist;

| is the difference between absolute
monarchy and democracy made.
If it doesn't recognize the rights
of human beings as such, it can
form nothing but a •society based
upon hate. All people, nations,
and races must have the same
lights."
DR. MAZOUR closed the topic
of anti-Semitism by stating, "An
ti-Semitism is largely begun by
government circles for political
reasons. Anti-Semitism is not
deep; it is sporadic.
Mazour quest ioned Kerensky as
to how the Jewish question was
raised and dealt with during his
j legislative service. "Russia had
just begun its movement for a
j complete Democratic regime. I
j and my friends the liberals be-
I came the government and ordered
the cancellation of all restriction
: of the Jewish people: social, eco
nomical, political, religious. They
■ then had the right to become offi
cers and make a military career.
Only a minority in the state
Duma (legislative body) were an
! ti-Semitic," he said.
In reply to the question that
revolution was essentially Jewish,
Kerensky said, "that it was part
of the movement that had been
| going on from the 1 Sth century
' all over the woi Id. The ideas were
liberal, not socialist. Participat
ing were some Jews, some Poles,
but mainly Russians."

and director of Stanford Hillel
and contemporary Jewish scholar,
Dr. Howard M. Sachar.
INTRODUCING the topic of
anti-Semitism was a query to Ke
rensky by Sachar. "Is Russia's
present anti-Semitism artificial,
or is this racism inherent to the
Russian people?"
"A state or nation, as such has
no right to make a distinction be
tween citizens. They must have
equal rights in soiial, economical,
political, and religious matters.
This was the feeling held not only
by the radicals in Russia during
my period in the Dnma. hut the
honest conservatives as well," Ke
rensky replied forcibly.
"We believed the state must be
equal for all. Only in count l ies
where this important policy exist;

| is the difference between absolute
monarchy and democracy made.
If it doesn't recognize the rights
of human beings as such, it can
form nothing but a •society based
upon hate. All people, nations,
