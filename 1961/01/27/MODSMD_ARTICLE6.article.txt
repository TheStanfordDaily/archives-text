# Legislature Backs Up ATO Fight
## 
### JERRY RANKIN 
Stanford's student legislature
last night voiced its firm support
of Alpha Tan Omega fraternity in
its anti-discrimination battle with
the ATO national office.
LASSU unanimously adopted
this resolution: "Resolved: That
the ASSU Legislature hereby
commend and declare its support
for . . . ATO . . . for its refusal to
discriminate against Stanford stu
dents because of their race, re
ligion or creed."
THE motion was introduced by
Wilbur Representative Barry Car
tel', who said he felt it was neces
sary for LASSU to voice its back
ing of the embattled fraternity.
No one voted against the resolu
tion, all agreeing it was "right"
for LASSU to support the anti
discrimination fight. There was
little discussion on the motion.
ASSU President Larry Royse
and Men's Row Representative
Tony Moiso did, however, point
out that the three Stanford fra
ternities whose national constitu
tions still retain discriminatory
clauses could be hurt by any
"fast" action on the part of stu
dents trying to eliminate such
clauses in the Sigma Chi. Delta
Tau Delta and Kappa Alpha na
tional constitutions.
ROYSE and Moiso both de
clared they are against discrimi
nation. but that things cannot be
changed overnight, and that it
probably will be a few years be
fore discriminatory parts in those
fraternities' national documents
can be changed.
A committee of freshmen was
formed this month to investigate
discrimination in Stanford frater
nities, and Moiso said any undue
or hasty action on their part could
put the three houses "in a bind
with the national fraternity."
In a connected matter. Legisla
ture adopted a resolution com
mending the University and Dean
of Students H. Donald YVinbigler
for their prompt response in add
ing a nondiscrimination clause to
forms used by landlords who list
their rentals at the Housing Of
fice.
The motion also commended
"the courage of those students
who" brought the matter to the
University's attention last week.
IN other action. LASSU tabled
a proposed constitution for a
"Young Americans for Freedom"
group which wants to be allowed
to form on campus.
Purpose of the group, which is
admittedly conservative, would be
to serve as a focus point for stu
dents with conservative views.
Bob Turk, who will step in as
president of the organization if i1
is approved by LASSU, said the
YAF would not be presenting pro
grams, but would serve primarily
to help its members with trans
portation to talks, meeting places,
and so on.
Ill 1 ] said he doubted the group
would become "student-wide," or
that it should be placed under Po
litical Union, as Union Represent
ative Nancy Sherwood suggested.
Daily Editor Barry Greenberg
also advised putting such a group
under Poli Union, since, he said,
it fitted in with Poli Union's pur
pose as defined in the ASSU con
stitution.
ASSU Financial Manager Todd
Stewart finally moved to table the
motion and send it to the By-laws
and Rules Committee for study.
If the committee completes its
study in time, the matter will
come up again at next week's Leg
islature meeting.

stitution.
ASSU Financial Manager Todd
Stewart finally moved to table the
motion and send it to the By-laws
and Rules Committee for study.
If the committee completes its
study in time, the matter will
come up again at next week's Leg
islature meeting.
Stanford's student legislature
last night voiced its firm support
of Alpha Tan Omega fraternity in
its anti-discrimination battle with
the ATO national office.
LASSU unanimously adopted
this resolution: "Resolved: That
the ASSU Legislature hereby
commend and declare its support
for . . . ATO . . . for its refusal to
discriminate against Stanford stu
dents because of their race, re
ligion or creed."
THE motion was introduced by
Wilbur Representative Barry Car
tel', who said he felt it was neces
sary for LASSU to voice its back
ing of the embattled fraternity.
No one voted against the resolu
tion, all agreeing it was "right"
for LASSU to support the anti
discrimination fight. There was
little discussion on the motion.
ASSU President Larry Royse
and Men's Row Representative
Tony Moiso did, however, point
out that the three Stanford fra
ternities whose national constitu
tions still retain discriminatory
clauses could be hurt by any
"fast" action on the part of stu
dents trying to eliminate such
clauses in the Sigma Chi. Delta
Tau Delta and Kappa Alpha na
tional constitutions.
ROYSE and Moiso both de
clared they are against discrimi
nation. but that things cannot be
changed overnight, and that it
probably will be a few years be
fore discriminatory parts in those
fraternities' national documents
can be changed.
A committee of freshmen was
formed this month to investigate
discrimination in Stanford frater
nities, and Moiso said any undue
or hasty action on their part could
put the three houses "in a bind
with the national fraternity."
In a connected matter. Legisla
ture adopted a resolution com
mending the University and Dean
of Students H. Donald YVinbigler
for their prompt response in add
ing a nondiscrimination clause to
forms used by landlords who list
their rentals at the Housing Of
fice.
The motion also commended
"the courage of those students
who" brought the matter to the
University's attention last week.
IN other action. LASSU tabled
a proposed constitution for a
"Young Americans for Freedom"
group which wants to be allowed
to form on campus.
Purpose of the group, which is
admittedly conservative, would be
to serve as a focus point for stu
dents with conservative views.
Bob Turk, who will step in as
president of the organization if i1
is approved by LASSU, said the
YAF would not be presenting pro
grams, but would serve primarily
to help its members with trans
portation to talks, meeting places,
and so on.
Ill 1 ] said he doubted the group
would become "student-wide," or
that it should be placed under Po
litical Union, as Union Represent
ative Nancy Sherwood suggested.
Daily Editor Barry Greenberg
also advised putting such a group
under Poli Union, since, he said,
it fitted in with Poli Union's pur
pose as defined in the ASSU con
stitution.
