# Mosk, LASSU, IFC Support Local √ÅTO's
## President Sterling Also Preparing Statement 
### MAYNARD PARKER GREGG HOPKINS 
California Attorney General Stanley Mosk, LASSU and IFG Presi
dent S tender Sweeney stepped into a dispute between the Stanford
chapter of Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity and the national organiza
tion over the pledging of four Jewish students yesterday.
A spokesman for President Wallace Sterling said the president

also was preparing a statement
for Saturday, which would prob
ably favor the local chapter's
stand.
MOSK wrote the chapter a let
ter of moral support and urged
the chapter 1o take legal action.
He said he would file a brief as
friend of the court.
However, ATO President Mike
Kavanaugh said: "we have been
told by Frank Williams, Assistant
; California Attorney General that
!we have no legal grounds for
i court action against the national
fraternity.
"We appreciate Mosk's offer,
I but plan no legal action," he said.
If the charter is revoked Mosk
! promised to investigate ATO chap
iters on California state college
! campuses to see if their charters
| were in violation of the law
j against racial discrimination.
ATO HAS chapters at UC, San
Jose State, and UCLA in addition
| to USC and Occidental, both pri
! vatc schools.
At the same time Mosk sent a
letter to the Board of Trustees of
California state colleges urging
that fraternities be forced to re
move racial discrimination from
their charters.
Such clauses, he told newsmen,
violate "the public policy of the
state and the 14th amendment to
the constitution."
If the fraternities should fail to
remove the clauses, all recogni
tion by the colleges should be
withdrawn from the chapters.
IN SEPARATE action the
1 ASSU's Legislature unanimously
! passed a resolution in which the
| "ASSU Legislature commend and
! declare its support of the Stan
j ford chapter of ATO" in its stand.
Inter-fraternity Council Presi
j dent Stender Sweeney promised
that "we'll do everything we can
to aid them, come what may."
"We try in every way to dis
courage discrimination in any liv
ing group on campus, and we are
100 per cent behind the ATO chap
ter's courageous stand," he said.
The members of the local chap
ter seemed somewhat surprised
by the reaction to their stand
I which Mosk termed as "your con
tinued fight to uphold our demo
j cratic philosophy."
"We aren't trying to start a
i crusade," Kavanaugh said.
He reiterated "our position is
j one of choosing our members be
i cause they would be an asset to
the house. And when choosing
members we do not consider their
j religious beliefs.
As it stands now, Kavanaugh
j said, "we will probably lose our
charter" when the High Council
hears charges against the chapter
at closed active-alumni hearing to
morrow afternoon at 3 p.m. at
Rickey's Studio Inn.
The chapter, through a letter by
the chapter Secretary William
Karl Mygdal, asked all members
and alumni to support the chap
ter in its stand.
Presidents of Cal and San Jose
Alpha Tau Omega chapters
| seemed unconcerned and noncom
i mital after State Attorney Gen-
J eral Stanley Mosk told the State
j College Board of Trustees yester
day to force fraternities to re
| move discrimination from their
const it lit ions.
"This is the Stanford chapter's
' problem," said Todd Bart hold,
Cal ATO president. "We have
| until 1964 to eliminate the clause
objected to." "The problem has
never come up here," a San Jose
spokesman said, "it's well known
that our membership is restricted
to white Christians.
Membership restriction. Mosk
said, is "contrary to both State
and Federal Constitutions. The
[charter will cither be revised or
the local chapters will lose rccog-
I nit ion by stale schools."
