# White Clause Houses Talk

### 
Presidents of the Stanford Sig
ma Chi, Kappa Alpha and Delta
Tau Delta chapters, cited by Dean
of Men William G. Craig as hav
ing religious and/or racial dis
crimination clauses in their con
stitution. explained their positions
to The Daily yesterday.
Sigma Chi President Sam Vick
ers told The Daily that his house
presently has Jewish members,
but the chapter is now bound by
the "white clause" in its national
constitution. "This chapter is defi
nitely against discrimination of
any kind," Vickers said, "and an
effort will be made, as in the past,
to repeal the white clause at next
summer's gen oral fraternity
meeting."
Dick Mickley, Kappa Alpha
president, said his chapter is
"working to get rid" of the KA
clause, and said there is "a good
chance" that the next convention
will remove it, as pressure from
chapters all over the country be
comes greater.
A misinterpretation of the na
tional Delta Tau Delta constitu
tion by the Stanford administra
tion was charged by local presi
dent Bob Harrison. In 1958, he
said. Stanford Delts led the suc
cessful fight in their national con
vention for removal of a clause
denying membership to non-Cau
casians and non-Christians. The
only vestige in the constitution,
he said, is a phrase which stipu
lates "Christian standards of
morality."
