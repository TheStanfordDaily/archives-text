### PETER DUIGNAN Curator, Africa Collection 
(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth in a series of eight articles
on the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace. Today's
article is on the Institution's
Africa Collection.)

The Africa Collection started
in 1919 when the Eelgium Govern
ment presented to Mr. Hoover of
ficial documents and reports per
taining to the Belgian Congo and
Ruanda-Urundi. At the same time
an agent of the Provisional Ger
man Government gave a number
of maps and documents on Ger
man Africa. After establishment
of the Hoover War Library this
Africa base was supplemented by
reports of the League of Nations
Mandates Commissions and offi
cial gazettes of colonial powers.
Some materials were bought in
the 1940's to help in the writing of
two doctoral dissertations, but it
was not until Mrs. Ruth Perry
was appointed the first Curator of
the Africa Collection in 1956 that
a relatively extensive acquisition
program was undertaken. Mrs.
Perry's two trips to Africa—in
1956 and 1958—brought a great
many items frojn British West
Africa. During the past two years
intensive buying has significantly
increased the size of the Africa
Collection.
The Collection is limited to the
period from 1870 to the present,
to the fields of history, politics,
government, and economics, and
to Africa south of Sahara. Ap
proximately ten thousand books,
several hundred bound volumes of
government documents, and sev
eral thousand unbound items,
make up the African section of
the Library.
There are no specific limitations
on language coverage, but the
bulk of the material is in English
and French, with significant hold
ings in German, Portuguese, and
Russian. Since its general collec
tions are very strong for countries
of Western Europe, the Hoover
Institution maintains a good as
sortment of government publica
tions relating to the overseas tei'-
ritories. Pamphlets, newspapers,
magazines, and journals published
in Western Europe and dealing
with colonial Africa are also nu
merous.
Besides subscribing to the de
bates, gazettes, and various de
partmental reports for most Afri
can states, the Institution has a
valuable assortment of older gov
ernment documents. The Li
brary's holdings in this respect
are most extensive for the Gold
Coast, the Belgian Congo. Ruanda-
Urundi, South Africa, the Rho
desias, and some states of French
Africa.
Over 200 serials and 29 news
papers are received currently. An
other 75 journals and 30 news
papers will presently be added.
Although Hoover and Food Re
search have excellent Africa col

lections, it would be difficult to
build a sound African research
library without the support of
other University Libraries and de
partments. An effort has been
made, therefore, to stimulate Uni
versity interest and to coordinate
acquisitions. For example, Pro
fessor Merryman, Law Librarian,
recently agreed to accept custody
of several hundred volumes of
African legal material from
Hoover Institution. The Law Li
brary will henceforth assume re
sponsibility for maintaining and
expanding this important re
source. Many departments have
agreed to set aside some money to
purchase lw>oks about Africa. And
>lr. Grieder, acting director of the
University Library, has coop
erated generously in helping to
improve the African holdings.
The Hoover Institution cer
tainly can provide an excellent
base for future work on Africa.
We plan to expand acquisitions
and research in this important
field. By building on the already
considerable strength of the West
ern European Collections and the
University's British Documents
Collection, we hope to undertake
scholarly studies of the modern
period of European domination of
Africa. To further this goal, the
Institution has started microfilm
ing the "Confidential Prints" of
the British Foreign and Colonial
Offices relating lo Africa from
1870 to the limits imposed by the
fifty-year secrecy rule. These
prints constitute the most valu
able single source relating to
African affairs. Their possession
can make the Hoover Institution
the center of historical research
on British Africa from 1870 to
1910. Later, it is hoped to obtain
similar material relating to
French, Belgian, and German
Africa.
To cover the contemporary Af
rican scene will be more difficult.
Such a research library normally
takes about a generation to build.
As a start, we shall subscribe to
all important African newspapers,
journals, and magazines, and
search for African political and
trade-union literature.
For the present, four research
projects are planned: a history of
African* nationalism in Southern
Rhodesia from 1890 to 1960; a his
tory of the Nationalist Party in
South Africa; Communist inter
est in Black Africa; and, German
colonial rule in Togoland.
In order to call attention to the
wealth of African materials here
at Stanford two bibliographic sur
veys are in preparation. An an
notated, selected bibliography con
cerning Portugal and Portuguese
Africa will be done in cooperation
with the Food Research Institute,
under the direction of the rioted
British economic historian, R. J.
Hammond. The second survey will
be a guide to Hoover sources deal
ing with German colonial policy
and administration.
