Secretary Rusk's statement that
the Administration will "use free
ly the diplomatic channel" has na
turally enough raised the question
whether this means that the pub
lic will come to know and under
stand less of what is going on. The
question is a perennial one in a
democratic society. For true nego
tiation is impossible if it has to
be done publicly and yet a free
people cannot be left in the dark.
As Mr. Rusk says,"The value of
the diplomatic channel depends
on its privacy." But the public has
the right and the need to know
what is being done.
The problem can be stated so
that it sounds insoluble. But as
a matter of fact it is not at all im
possible, although it requires the
gifts of leadership, for a compe
tent government to keep the pub
lic well informed without destroy
ing the privacy which is essential
to diplomatic negotiations. It can
be done by periodic talks, one
might almost say lectures, given
by the President and the Secre
tary of State explaining the situa
tion and how it got to he what it
is, and what are the difficulties
and the issues which have to be
dealt with.
This is what Churchill did In
his great war speeches. Il*Â» rallied
men not only by the eloquence
and beauty of his words but even
more, I venture to believe, by con
vincing them that on the issues of
life and death they were in the
know. Not many can be so elo
quent as Churchill. Rut the Demo
cratic leaders can tell the story.
There is no need for Mr. Lincoln
White, for example, to tell the
newspapers what Mr. Khrushchev
said to Mr. Thompson when they
met at the Kremlin, or what Mr.
Macmillan said to Mr. Kennedy in
a message passed on by the Am
bassador. The indispensable pri

vacy of diplomatic intercourse
can be preserved if the leaders
know how to talk informatively to
the iH'ople on the issues of policy.
To talk informatively is in the
main to narrate the history, and
to be very sparing of pious gen
eralities and of the old stereotype
of exhortation and defiance. For
if the leaders will interest and do
not bore the public, there will be
; less interest in keyholes and in
eavesdropping and leaks.
Quiet diplomacy must not be
identified with withdrawal from
the public view, with the with
holding of knowledge, with lock
ing the door and pulling down the
blinds. In a democratic society
quiet diplomacy is possible and
can be fruitful only if at the same
time there is an increase of com
munication on foreign affairs be
tween the Chief Executive and
the public.
Moreover, it can l>e said, I
think, (hat diplomatic intercourse
can lw kept quiet, and private only
if it becomes routine and common
place. Mr. Khrushchev's inter
view with Ambassador Thompson
is not a true example of quiet di
plomacy. For the meeting is not
quiet when it is announced to the
1 whole world, and the proof that it
was not quiet is that there are
leaks about it all over the place.
There will not be effective quiet
diplomacy until in Moscow and
in Washington diplomatic meet
ings are so habitual thai they are
not public events.
Let us hope that we shall get
to this. For the great questions
which have eventually to be ne
gotiated cannot be resolved by
arm's- length pronunciamentos.
They can be resolved only if inti
mate and informal talks open the
way for formal negotiations.
