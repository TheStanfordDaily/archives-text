Editor, The Daily:
| Recently we have heard of an
I outstanding young humorist on
our campus, and would like to en
list your help in finding him. A
Mr. W. R. Webb, who is perhaps
doing advanced research in the
Creative Writing Department
but they have no record of him.
Is there some way you could at
tract his attention?
Word has reached us that he
specializes in the parody of com
plaint letters and literary criti
cism, but we have only been able
to find one extant work by the
man: a poorly done parody of a
bitch-letter which was rejected by
our Managing Editor. But rumor
has it that he is interested in
working for the Chappie and we
need people badly.
The need for interested workers
has become more urgent as the
academic pressure increases. Peo
ple are less and less willing to
take a few hours off. The letter
grade frustration is being felt in
every extracurricular activity on
j campus, fear of failure is becom
ing the dominant campus tone.
Students are taking things seri
ously—too seriously. Few can see
the humor in Stanford and laugh
at their plight; those who can see
it generally keep quiet, feeling
that they are the "Lone Ranger."
We Chappies have tried to find
these individuals. Perhaps we
haven't tried hard enough. For
the record, we need writers, car
toonists, artists and idea-men
(and women).
The OLD BOY takes this op
portunity to thank those whose
acclaim and purchase of a Chapar
ral made the last two issues of
our magazine such a success.
With the rise of Labor Unionism
there has been less chance for
student publication surviv a 1.
Printing costs have risen steadily.
The Chaparral, for instance, costs
42 cents per copy from the Stan
ford University Press.
We sell it for 40 cents per copy
and absorb the loss through our
advertising. It is a hard fact of
the economic world that a 2-cent
loss on a series of sales impales
I a publication. Sequoia has had to
face this problem. The Daily
would also, if it weren't paid for
out of your tuition. If you want a
campus humor magazine, you will
have to support it and contribute
to it.
We Chappies would like to hear
more about what the students
want in a magazine. We en
courage letters to the Editor of
the Chappie, Box 7256, or to The
Daily for the general reader. We
are interested in ideas and sug
gested improvements.
The requests for vicarious sex
ual gratification in terms of
"Nude Queen Shols" or "sexy
stories," have little to do with
humor. We usually disregard such
pleas. Erotic realism in stories,
I such as in a forthcoming article
I by Mike Datisman of the Deke
j House, is, however, in good taste
and humorous.
To this extent—the illumination
of humorous idiosyncrasies in the
sexual relations of real people—
we are willing to include sex in
the magazine. We leave jokes
about the performance of sex to
the grade-school bathroom walls.

Now that the University has
made its philosophy known for
once and for all in regard to racial
discrimination (in the recent
statement of the policy of the
rental registry office), perhaps it
can devote some thought to a
very real policy of discrimination
which it itself practices. I refer,
of course, to its refusal to rent
University student apartments to
those of us who have children to
house, but no mates.
I have previously lived, sans
mate, in both Tulane and LSU's
apartment projects, and the offi
cials in both of these institutions
seemed to have felt that there
were no special problems con
cerned. I have also been assured
by both Pennsylvania State Uni
versity and Florida State Univer
sity that I would be acceptable in
their projects. In fact, Stanford
is the only university I know
which has made this peculiar
ruling.
It seems to me that those of us
in this category face enough prob
lems in trying to educate our
selves and raise our children ade
quately, without having more ob
stacles deliberately constructed
for us. Instead of sympathy and
encouragement from presumably
enlightened powers, we find the
opposite. Surely an institution of
Stanford's stature can do better
than this.

Editor, The Daily:
It is common knowledge that
the Stanford chapter of the Alpha
Tail Omega Fraternity has lost
its charter because Ihe Stanford
chapter has failed to comply with
the discriminatory provision of
the national charter.
Realizing the strong propensity
that the Stanford Daily has for
| fighting for "would be" progres
sive movements, I feel that the
Stanford Daily will zealously sup
j port the actions of the local chap
| ier as opposed to Ihe national fra

ternity. Therefore, as a matter of
conscience, I feel obligated to
state my position.
First let me make it clear that
I am against a while, Christian
clause in any national fraternity
charter, or, for that matter, dis
crimination in any form. The
question at stake is not a question
of discrimination; it is a question
of the right of personal contract
and the right of association.
The members of the local chap
ter of Alpha Tail Omega estab
lished a personal contract with
the national fraternity when they
pledged. At this time they knew
the national charter had a dis
criminatory c 1 a us e, and they
promised it their good will and
full support.
Now they seem to find the
above mentioned clause in con
flict with their consciences. They,
therefore, AS INDIVIDUALS,
have an obligation to relinquish
their membership in the national
fraternity. With respect to the
contract with the national fratern
ity, which they created by pledg
ing, they were bound by honor 1o
keep the local chapter within the
limits and provisions of the na
tional charter.
The right of association, being
God-given, seems to be self-evi
dent. We exercise it in choosing
childhood friends, high school
sweethearts, social, political, and
religious affiliations. If we limit
in any circumstances, we are as
suming the right to limit it in all
circumstances. No man has this
right.
God-given rights are the es
sence of the American way of
life. Personal contracts are the
bulwarks of American society.

Following is a list of "the most
important suggestions concerning
the method of proctoring exami
nations" from a large Eastern
university:
1. Proctors should be in the
room assigned at least 15 minutes
before the examination begins so
that when the hour arrives exami
nation papers can be distributed
quickly and proctors will already

have been assigned to their desig
nated stations in the room. They
should observe cases of certain
groups who come early and sit
together, forming individual
cliques.
2. As students arrive for the
examination, they should be in
stinct ed to leave all books, papers,
notebooks, or any other material
of this sort at some point in the
room selected in advance for that
purpose. No student should be
permited to have this material at
his seat in the room.
3. Have as few public announce
ments as possible. When neces
sary they should be marie by the
instructor in charge.
4. If a student wants to leave
the room he should have a proctor
with him.
5. After the examination be
gins, a proctor should be assigned
to each door leading into the room
so that students arriving late may
receive their examination papers
immediately.
6. Each proctor, assigned to a
definite part of the room, should
move about in such a way that he
will at all times have a view of
the group under his supervision.
7. When a student asks a ques
tion regarding the examination,
the proctor should signal the per
son in charge of the examination
who should make all interpreta
tions and answer all questions
pertaining to the examination.
8. At the conclusion of the ex
amination, each exit from the
room should be covered by a proc
tor who will see that no one
leaves the room without leaving
an examination paper unless he
has made proper explanation
therefore to the instructor in
charge.
9. If the proctor has reason to
suspect that cheating is taking

place but is not in a position to
prove it, the proctor should im
mediately move the person or per
sons whom he thinks responsible.
It should be explained to the stu
dent under these circumstances
that he is being moved for his
own protection. The proctor
should remember that proof is not
needed but suspicion alone is
enough in a case of this kind.
10. When no evidence of cheat
ing has developed, it is advisable
to have the proctor appear, not
as a policeman, but as a servant,
because if you are looking for
trouble you will get it. There are
a number of services proctors
can render.
11. If you suspect cheating, but
have no evidence, one of the best
formulas to use is to speak to the
persons suspected on some pre

text, note the names involved, and
check the papers as they are
turned in for likenesses.
12. When a proctor observes a
student cribbing in any way what
soever. he must be absolutely sure
of his facts before making an ac
cusation of any kind. It' the crib
involves a piece of paper he
should request the student to
hand it to him at once. Act quick
ly so that the student will not
have an opportunity to get the
crib into a pocket or pocket-book,
as would bo the case if the proc
tor went to call someone else.
13. All cases of cribbing should
be reported to the instructor and
a further report should be made
by the proctor to the Registrar
who will refer the case to ihe
Scholarship Comm ill ee,

Students are taking things seri

We Chappies would like to hear

Now that the University has
made its philosophy known for
once and for all in regard to racial
discrimination (in the recent
statement of the policy of the
rental registry office), perhaps it
can devote some thought to a
very real policy of discrimination
which it itself practices. I refer,
of course, to its refusal to rent
University student apartments to
those of us who have children to
house, but no mates.
I have previously lived, sans
mate, in both Tulane and LSU's
apartment projects, and the offi
cials in both of these institutions
seemed to have felt that there
were no special problems con
cerned. I have also been assured
by both Pennsylvania State Uni
versity and Florida State Univer
sity that I would be acceptable in
their projects. In fact, Stanford
is the only university I know
which has made this peculiar
ruling.
It seems to me that those of us
in this category face enough prob
lems in trying to educate our
selves and raise our children ade
quately, without having more ob
stacles deliberately constructed
for us. Instead of sympathy and
encouragement from presumably
enlightened powers, we find the
opposite. Surely an institution of
Stanford's stature can do better
than this.

It is common knowledge that
the Stanford chapter of the Alpha
Tail Omega Fraternity has lost
its charter because Ihe Stanford
chapter has failed to comply with
the discriminatory provision of
the national charter.
Realizing the strong propensity
that the Stanford Daily has for
| fighting for "would be" progres
sive movements, I feel that the
Stanford Daily will zealously sup
j port the actions of the local chap
| ier as opposed to Ihe national fra

ternity. Therefore, as a matter of
conscience, I feel obligated to
state my position.
First let me make it clear that
I am against a while, Christian
clause in any national fraternity
charter, or, for that matter, dis
crimination in any form. The
question at stake is not a question
of discrimination; it is a question
of the right of personal contract
and the right of association.
The members of the local chap
ter of Alpha Tail Omega estab
lished a personal contract with
the national fraternity when they
pledged. At this time they knew
the national charter had a dis
criminatory c 1 a us e, and they
promised it their good will and
full support.
Now they seem to find the
above mentioned clause in con
flict with their consciences. They,
therefore, AS INDIVIDUALS,
have an obligation to relinquish
their membership in the national
fraternity. With respect to the
contract with the national fratern
ity, which they created by pledg
ing, they were bound by honor 1o
keep the local chapter within the
limits and provisions of the na
tional charter.
The right of association, being
God-given, seems to be self-evi
dent. We exercise it in choosing
childhood friends, high school
sweethearts, social, political, and
religious affiliations. If we limit
in any circumstances, we are as
suming the right to limit it in all
circumstances. No man has this
right.
God-given rights are the es
sence of the American way of
life. Personal contracts are the
bulwarks of American society.

Following is a list of "the most
important suggestions concerning
the method of proctoring exami
nations" from a large Eastern
university:
1. Proctors should be in the
room assigned at least 15 minutes
before the examination begins so
that when the hour arrives exami
nation papers can be distributed
quickly and proctors will already

have been assigned to their desig
nated stations in the room. They
should observe cases of certain
groups who come early and sit
together, forming individual
cliques.
2. As students arrive for the
examination, they should be in
stinct ed to leave all books, papers,
notebooks, or any other material
of this sort at some point in the
room selected in advance for that
purpose. No student should be
permited to have this material at
his seat in the room.
3. Have as few public announce
ments as possible. When neces
sary they should be marie by the
instructor in charge.
4. If a student wants to leave
the room he should have a proctor
with him.
5. After the examination be
gins, a proctor should be assigned
to each door leading into the room
so that students arriving late may
receive their examination papers
immediately.
6. Each proctor, assigned to a
definite part of the room, should
move about in such a way that he
will at all times have a view of
the group under his supervision.
7. When a student asks a ques
tion regarding the examination,
the proctor should signal the per
son in charge of the examination
who should make all interpreta
tions and answer all questions
pertaining to the examination.
8. At the conclusion of the ex
amination, each exit from the
room should be covered by a proc
tor who will see that no one
leaves the room without leaving
an examination paper unless he
has made proper explanation
therefore to the instructor in
charge.
9. If the proctor has reason to
suspect that cheating is taking

place but is not in a position to
prove it, the proctor should im
mediately move the person or per
sons whom he thinks responsible.
It should be explained to the stu
dent under these circumstances
that he is being moved for his
own protection. The proctor
should remember that proof is not
needed but suspicion alone is
enough in a case of this kind.
10. When no evidence of cheat
ing has developed, it is advisable
to have the proctor appear, not
as a policeman, but as a servant,
because if you are looking for
trouble you will get it. There are
a number of services proctors
can render.
11. If you suspect cheating, but
have no evidence, one of the best
formulas to use is to speak to the
persons suspected on some pre

text, note the names involved, and
check the papers as they are
turned in for likenesses.
12. When a proctor observes a
student cribbing in any way what
soever. he must be absolutely sure
of his facts before making an ac
cusation of any kind. It' the crib
involves a piece of paper he
should request the student to
hand it to him at once. Act quick
ly so that the student will not
have an opportunity to get the
crib into a pocket or pocket-book,
as would bo the case if the proc
tor went to call someone else.
13. All cases of cribbing should
be reported to the instructor and
a further report should be made
by the proctor to the Registrar
who will refer the case to ihe
Scholarship Comm ill ee,

Now that the University has
made its philosophy known for
once and for all in regard to racial
discrimination (in the recent
statement of the policy of the
rental registry office), perhaps it
can devote some thought to a
very real policy of discrimination
which it itself practices. I refer,
of course, to its refusal to rent
University student apartments to
those of us who have children to
house, but no mates.
I have previously lived, sans
mate, in both Tulane and LSU's
apartment projects, and the offi
cials in both of these institutions
seemed to have felt that there
were no special problems con
cerned. I have also been assured
by both Pennsylvania State Uni
versity and Florida State Univer
sity that I would be acceptable in
their projects. In fact, Stanford
is the only university I know
which has made this peculiar
ruling.
It seems to me that those of us
in this category face enough prob
lems in trying to educate our
selves and raise our children ade
quately, without having more ob
stacles deliberately constructed
for us. Instead of sympathy and
encouragement from presumably
enlightened powers, we find the
opposite. Surely an institution of
Stanford's stature can do better
than this.

It is common knowledge that
the Stanford chapter of the Alpha
Tail Omega Fraternity has lost
its charter because Ihe Stanford
chapter has failed to comply with
the discriminatory provision of
the national charter.
Realizing the strong propensity
that the Stanford Daily has for
| fighting for "would be" progres
sive movements, I feel that the
Stanford Daily will zealously sup
j port the actions of the local chap
| ier as opposed to Ihe national fra

ternity. Therefore, as a matter of
conscience, I feel obligated to
state my position.
First let me make it clear that
I am against a while, Christian
clause in any national fraternity
charter, or, for that matter, dis
crimination in any form. The
question at stake is not a question
of discrimination; it is a question
of the right of personal contract
and the right of association.
The members of the local chap
ter of Alpha Tail Omega estab
lished a personal contract with
the national fraternity when they
pledged. At this time they knew
the national charter had a dis
criminatory c 1 a us e, and they
promised it their good will and
full support.
Now they seem to find the
above mentioned clause in con
flict with their consciences. They,
therefore, AS INDIVIDUALS,
have an obligation to relinquish
their membership in the national
fraternity. With respect to the
contract with the national fratern
ity, which they created by pledg
ing, they were bound by honor 1o
keep the local chapter within the
limits and provisions of the na
tional charter.
The right of association, being
God-given, seems to be self-evi
dent. We exercise it in choosing
childhood friends, high school
sweethearts, social, political, and
religious affiliations. If we limit
in any circumstances, we are as
suming the right to limit it in all
circumstances. No man has this
right.
God-given rights are the es
sence of the American way of
life. Personal contracts are the
bulwarks of American society.

Following is a list of "the most
important suggestions concerning
the method of proctoring exami
nations" from a large Eastern
university:
1. Proctors should be in the
room assigned at least 15 minutes
before the examination begins so
that when the hour arrives exami
nation papers can be distributed
quickly and proctors will already

have been assigned to their desig
nated stations in the room. They
should observe cases of certain
groups who come early and sit
together, forming individual
cliques.
2. As students arrive for the
examination, they should be in
stinct ed to leave all books, papers,
notebooks, or any other material
of this sort at some point in the
room selected in advance for that
purpose. No student should be
permited to have this material at
his seat in the room.
3. Have as few public announce
ments as possible. When neces
sary they should be marie by the
instructor in charge.
4. If a student wants to leave
the room he should have a proctor
with him.
5. After the examination be
gins, a proctor should be assigned
to each door leading into the room
so that students arriving late may
receive their examination papers
immediately.
6. Each proctor, assigned to a
definite part of the room, should
move about in such a way that he
will at all times have a view of
the group under his supervision.
7. When a student asks a ques
tion regarding the examination,
the proctor should signal the per
son in charge of the examination
who should make all interpreta
tions and answer all questions
pertaining to the examination.
8. At the conclusion of the ex
amination, each exit from the
room should be covered by a proc
tor who will see that no one
leaves the room without leaving
an examination paper unless he
has made proper explanation
therefore to the instructor in
charge.
9. If the proctor has reason to
suspect that cheating is taking

place but is not in a position to
prove it, the proctor should im
mediately move the person or per
sons whom he thinks responsible.
It should be explained to the stu
dent under these circumstances
that he is being moved for his
own protection. The proctor
should remember that proof is not
needed but suspicion alone is
enough in a case of this kind.
10. When no evidence of cheat
ing has developed, it is advisable
to have the proctor appear, not
as a policeman, but as a servant,
because if you are looking for
trouble you will get it. There are
a number of services proctors
can render.
11. If you suspect cheating, but
have no evidence, one of the best
formulas to use is to speak to the
persons suspected on some pre

text, note the names involved, and
check the papers as they are
turned in for likenesses.
12. When a proctor observes a
student cribbing in any way what
soever. he must be absolutely sure
of his facts before making an ac
cusation of any kind. It' the crib
involves a piece of paper he
should request the student to
hand it to him at once. Act quick
ly so that the student will not
have an opportunity to get the
crib into a pocket or pocket-book,
as would bo the case if the proc
tor went to call someone else.
13. All cases of cribbing should
be reported to the instructor and
a further report should be made
by the proctor to the Registrar
who will refer the case to ihe
Scholarship Comm ill ee,

Now that the University has
made its philosophy known for
once and for all in regard to racial
discrimination (in the recent
statement of the policy of the
rental registry office), perhaps it
can devote some thought to a
very real policy of discrimination
which it itself practices. I refer,
of course, to its refusal to rent
University student apartments to
those of us who have children to
house, but no mates.
I have previously lived, sans
mate, in both Tulane and LSU's
apartment projects, and the offi
cials in both of these institutions
seemed to have felt that there
were no special problems con
cerned. I have also been assured
by both Pennsylvania State Uni
versity and Florida State Univer
sity that I would be acceptable in
their projects. In fact, Stanford
is the only university I know
which has made this peculiar
ruling.
It seems to me that those of us
in this category face enough prob
lems in trying to educate our
selves and raise our children ade
quately, without having more ob
stacles deliberately constructed
for us. Instead of sympathy and
encouragement from presumably
enlightened powers, we find the
opposite. Surely an institution of
Stanford's stature can do better
than this.

It is common knowledge that
the Stanford chapter of the Alpha
Tail Omega Fraternity has lost
its charter because Ihe Stanford
chapter has failed to comply with
the discriminatory provision of
the national charter.
Realizing the strong propensity
that the Stanford Daily has for
| fighting for "would be" progres
sive movements, I feel that the
Stanford Daily will zealously sup
j port the actions of the local chap
| ier as opposed to Ihe national fra

ternity. Therefore, as a matter of
conscience, I feel obligated to
state my position.
First let me make it clear that
I am against a while, Christian
clause in any national fraternity
charter, or, for that matter, dis
crimination in any form. The
question at stake is not a question
of discrimination; it is a question
of the right of personal contract
and the right of association.
The members of the local chap
ter of Alpha Tail Omega estab
lished a personal contract with
the national fraternity when they
pledged. At this time they knew
the national charter had a dis
criminatory c 1 a us e, and they
promised it their good will and
full support.
Now they seem to find the
above mentioned clause in con
flict with their consciences. They,
therefore, AS INDIVIDUALS,
have an obligation to relinquish
their membership in the national
fraternity. With respect to the
contract with the national fratern
ity, which they created by pledg
ing, they were bound by honor 1o
keep the local chapter within the
limits and provisions of the na
tional charter.
The right of association, being
God-given, seems to be self-evi
dent. We exercise it in choosing
childhood friends, high school
sweethearts, social, political, and
religious affiliations. If we limit
in any circumstances, we are as
suming the right to limit it in all
circumstances. No man has this
right.
God-given rights are the es
sence of the American way of
life. Personal contracts are the
bulwarks of American society.

Following is a list of "the most
important suggestions concerning
the method of proctoring exami
nations" from a large Eastern
university:
1. Proctors should be in the
room assigned at least 15 minutes
before the examination begins so
that when the hour arrives exami
nation papers can be distributed
quickly and proctors will already

have been assigned to their desig
nated stations in the room. They
should observe cases of certain
groups who come early and sit
together, forming individual
cliques.
2. As students arrive for the
examination, they should be in
stinct ed to leave all books, papers,
notebooks, or any other material
of this sort at some point in the
room selected in advance for that
purpose. No student should be
permited to have this material at
his seat in the room.
3. Have as few public announce
ments as possible. When neces
sary they should be marie by the
instructor in charge.
4. If a student wants to leave
the room he should have a proctor
with him.
5. After the examination be
gins, a proctor should be assigned
to each door leading into the room
so that students arriving late may
receive their examination papers
immediately.
6. Each proctor, assigned to a
definite part of the room, should
move about in such a way that he
will at all times have a view of
the group under his supervision.
7. When a student asks a ques
tion regarding the examination,
the proctor should signal the per
son in charge of the examination
who should make all interpreta
tions and answer all questions
pertaining to the examination.
8. At the conclusion of the ex
amination, each exit from the
room should be covered by a proc
tor who will see that no one
leaves the room without leaving
an examination paper unless he
has made proper explanation
therefore to the instructor in
charge.
9. If the proctor has reason to
suspect that cheating is taking

place but is not in a position to
prove it, the proctor should im
mediately move the person or per
sons whom he thinks responsible.
It should be explained to the stu
dent under these circumstances
that he is being moved for his
own protection. The proctor
should remember that proof is not
needed but suspicion alone is
enough in a case of this kind.
10. When no evidence of cheat
ing has developed, it is advisable
to have the proctor appear, not
as a policeman, but as a servant,
because if you are looking for
trouble you will get it. There are
a number of services proctors
can render.
11. If you suspect cheating, but
have no evidence, one of the best
formulas to use is to speak to the
persons suspected on some pre

text, note the names involved, and
check the papers as they are
turned in for likenesses.
12. When a proctor observes a
student cribbing in any way what
soever. he must be absolutely sure
of his facts before making an ac
cusation of any kind. It' the crib
involves a piece of paper he
should request the student to
hand it to him at once. Act quick
ly so that the student will not
have an opportunity to get the
crib into a pocket or pocket-book,
as would bo the case if the proc
tor went to call someone else.
13. All cases of cribbing should
be reported to the instructor and
a further report should be made
by the proctor to the Registrar
who will refer the case to ihe
Scholarship Comm ill ee,

| Recently we have heard of an
I outstanding young humorist on
our campus, and would like to en
list your help in finding him. A
Mr. W. R. Webb, who is perhaps
doing advanced research in the
Creative Writing Department
but they have no record of him.
Is there some way you could at
tract his attention?
Word has reached us that he
specializes in the parody of com
plaint letters and literary criti
cism, but we have only been able
to find one extant work by the
man: a poorly done parody of a
bitch-letter which was rejected by
our Managing Editor. But rumor
has it that he is interested in
working for the Chappie and we
need people badly.
The need for interested workers
has become more urgent as the
academic pressure increases. Peo
ple are less and less willing to
take a few hours off. The letter
grade frustration is being felt in
every extracurricular activity on
j campus, fear of failure is becom
ing the dominant campus tone.
Students are taking things seri
ously—too seriously. Few can see
the humor in Stanford and laugh
at their plight; those who can see
it generally keep quiet, feeling
that they are the "Lone Ranger."
We Chappies have tried to find
these individuals. Perhaps we
haven't tried hard enough. For
the record, we need writers, car
toonists, artists and idea-men
(and women).
The OLD BOY takes this op
portunity to thank those whose
acclaim and purchase of a Chapar
ral made the last two issues of
our magazine such a success.
With the rise of Labor Unionism
there has been less chance for
student publication surviv a 1.
Printing costs have risen steadily.
The Chaparral, for instance, costs
42 cents per copy from the Stan
ford University Press.
We sell it for 40 cents per copy
and absorb the loss through our
advertising. It is a hard fact of
the economic world that a 2-cent
loss on a series of sales impales
I a publication. Sequoia has had to
face this problem. The Daily
would also, if it weren't paid for
out of your tuition. If you want a
campus humor magazine, you will
have to support it and contribute
to it.
We Chappies would like to hear
more about what the students
want in a magazine. We en
courage letters to the Editor of
the Chappie, Box 7256, or to The
Daily for the general reader. We
are interested in ideas and sug
gested improvements.
The requests for vicarious sex
ual gratification in terms of
"Nude Queen Shols" or "sexy
stories," have little to do with
humor. We usually disregard such
pleas. Erotic realism in stories,
I such as in a forthcoming article
I by Mike Datisman of the Deke
j House, is, however, in good taste
and humorous.
To this extent—the illumination
of humorous idiosyncrasies in the
sexual relations of real people—
we are willing to include sex in

It is common knowledge that
the Stanford chapter of the Alpha
Tail Omega Fraternity has lost
its charter because Ihe Stanford
chapter has failed to comply with
the discriminatory provision of
the national charter.
Realizing the strong propensity
that the Stanford Daily has for
| fighting for "would be" progres
sive movements, I feel that the
Stanford Daily will zealously sup
j port the actions of the local chap
| ier as opposed to Ihe national fra

ternity. Therefore, as a matter of
conscience, I feel obligated to
state my position.
First let me make it clear that
I am against a while, Christian
clause in any national fraternity
charter, or, for that matter, dis
crimination in any form. The
question at stake is not a question
of discrimination; it is a question
of the right of personal contract
and the right of association.
The members of the local chap
ter of Alpha Tail Omega estab
lished a personal contract with
the national fraternity when they
pledged. At this time they knew
the national charter had a dis
criminatory c 1 a us e, and they
promised it their good will and
full support.
Now they seem to find the
above mentioned clause in con
flict with their consciences. They,
therefore, AS INDIVIDUALS,
have an obligation to relinquish
their membership in the national
fraternity. With respect to the
contract with the national fratern
ity, which they created by pledg
ing, they were bound by honor 1o
keep the local chapter within the
limits and provisions of the na
tional charter.
The right of association, being
God-given, seems to be self-evi
dent. We exercise it in choosing
childhood friends, high school
sweethearts, social, political, and
religious affiliations. If we limit
in any circumstances, we are as
suming the right to limit it in all
circumstances. No man has this
right.
God-given rights are the es
sence of the American way of
life. Personal contracts are the
bulwarks of American society.

Following is a list of "the most
important suggestions concerning
the method of proctoring exami
nations" from a large Eastern
university:
1. Proctors should be in the
room assigned at least 15 minutes
before the examination begins so
that when the hour arrives exami
nation papers can be distributed
quickly and proctors will already

have been assigned to their desig
nated stations in the room. They
should observe cases of certain
groups who come early and sit
together, forming individual
cliques.
2. As students arrive for the
examination, they should be in
stinct ed to leave all books, papers,
notebooks, or any other material
of this sort at some point in the
room selected in advance for that
purpose. No student should be
permited to have this material at
his seat in the room.
3. Have as few public announce
ments as possible. When neces
sary they should be marie by the
instructor in charge.
4. If a student wants to leave
the room he should have a proctor
with him.
5. After the examination be
gins, a proctor should be assigned
to each door leading into the room
so that students arriving late may
receive their examination papers
immediately.
6. Each proctor, assigned to a
definite part of the room, should
move about in such a way that he
will at all times have a view of
the group under his supervision.
7. When a student asks a ques
tion regarding the examination,
the proctor should signal the per
son in charge of the examination
who should make all interpreta
tions and answer all questions
pertaining to the examination.
8. At the conclusion of the ex
amination, each exit from the
room should be covered by a proc
tor who will see that no one
leaves the room without leaving
an examination paper unless he
has made proper explanation
therefore to the instructor in
charge.
9. If the proctor has reason to
suspect that cheating is taking

place but is not in a position to
prove it, the proctor should im
mediately move the person or per
sons whom he thinks responsible.
It should be explained to the stu
dent under these circumstances
that he is being moved for his
own protection. The proctor
should remember that proof is not
needed but suspicion alone is
enough in a case of this kind.
10. When no evidence of cheat
ing has developed, it is advisable
to have the proctor appear, not
as a policeman, but as a servant,
because if you are looking for
trouble you will get it. There are
a number of services proctors
can render.
11. If you suspect cheating, but
have no evidence, one of the best
formulas to use is to speak to the
persons suspected on some pre

text, note the names involved, and
check the papers as they are
turned in for likenesses.
12. When a proctor observes a
student cribbing in any way what
soever. he must be absolutely sure
of his facts before making an ac
cusation of any kind. It' the crib
involves a piece of paper he
should request the student to
hand it to him at once. Act quick
ly so that the student will not
have an opportunity to get the
crib into a pocket or pocket-book,
as would bo the case if the proc
tor went to call someone else.
13. All cases of cribbing should
be reported to the instructor and
a further report should be made
by the proctor to the Registrar
who will refer the case to ihe
Scholarship Comm ill ee,

| Recently we have heard of an
I outstanding young humorist on
our campus, and would like to en
list your help in finding him. A
Mr. W. R. Webb, who is perhaps
doing advanced research in the
Creative Writing Department
but they have no record of him.
Is there some way you could at
tract his attention?
Word has reached us that he
specializes in the parody of com
plaint letters and literary criti
cism, but we have only been able
to find one extant work by the
man: a poorly done parody of a
bitch-letter which was rejected by
our Managing Editor. But rumor
has it that he is interested in
working for the Chappie and we
need people badly.
The need for interested workers
has become more urgent as the
academic pressure increases. Peo
ple are less and less willing to
take a few hours off. The letter
grade frustration is being felt in
every extracurricular activity on
j campus, fear of failure is becom
ing the dominant campus tone.
Students are taking things seri
ously—too seriously. Few can see
the humor in Stanford and laugh
at their plight; those who can see
it generally keep quiet, feeling
that they are the "Lone Ranger."
We Chappies have tried to find
these individuals. Perhaps we
haven't tried hard enough. For
the record, we need writers, car
toonists, artists and idea-men
(and women).
The OLD BOY takes this op
portunity to thank those whose
acclaim and purchase of a Chapar
ral made the last two issues of
our magazine such a success.
With the rise of Labor Unionism
there has been less chance for
student publication surviv a 1.
Printing costs have risen steadily.
The Chaparral, for instance, costs
42 cents per copy from the Stan
ford University Press.
We sell it for 40 cents per copy
and absorb the loss through our
advertising. It is a hard fact of
the economic world that a 2-cent
loss on a series of sales impales
I a publication. Sequoia has had to
face this problem. The Daily
would also, if it weren't paid for
out of your tuition. If you want a
campus humor magazine, you will
have to support it and contribute
to it.
We Chappies would like to hear
more about what the students
want in a magazine. We en
courage letters to the Editor of
the Chappie, Box 7256, or to The
Daily for the general reader. We
are interested in ideas and sug
gested improvements.
The requests for vicarious sex
ual gratification in terms of
"Nude Queen Shols" or "sexy
stories," have little to do with
humor. We usually disregard such
pleas. Erotic realism in stories,
I such as in a forthcoming article
I by Mike Datisman of the Deke
j House, is, however, in good taste
and humorous.
To this extent—the illumination
of humorous idiosyncrasies in the
sexual relations of real people—
we are willing to include sex in
the magazine. We leave jokes
about the performance of sex to
the grade-school bathroom walls.

Now that the University has
made its philosophy known for
once and for all in regard to racial
discrimination (in the recent
statement of the policy of the
rental registry office), perhaps it
can devote some thought to a
very real policy of discrimination
which it itself practices. I refer,
of course, to its refusal to rent
University student apartments to
those of us who have children to
house, but no mates.
I have previously lived, sans
mate, in both Tulane and LSU's
apartment projects, and the offi
cials in both of these institutions
seemed to have felt that there
were no special problems con
cerned. I have also been assured
by both Pennsylvania State Uni
versity and Florida State Univer
sity that I would be acceptable in
their projects. In fact, Stanford
is the only university I know
which has made this peculiar
ruling.

charter, or, for that matter, dis
crimination in any form. The
question at stake is not a question
of discrimination; it is a question
of the right of personal contract
and the right of association.
The members of the local chap
ter of Alpha Tail Omega estab
lished a personal contract with
the national fraternity when they
pledged. At this time they knew
the national charter had a dis
criminatory c 1 a us e, and they
promised it their good will and
full support.
Now they seem to find the
above mentioned clause in con
flict with their consciences. They,
therefore, AS INDIVIDUALS,
have an obligation to relinquish
their membership in the national
fraternity. With respect to the
contract with the national fratern
ity, which they created by pledg
ing, they were bound by honor 1o
keep the local chapter within the
limits and provisions of the na
tional charter.
The right of association, being
God-given, seems to be self-evi
dent. We exercise it in choosing
childhood friends, high school
sweethearts, social, political, and
religious affiliations. If we limit
in any circumstances, we are as
suming the right to limit it in all
circumstances. No man has this
right.
God-given rights are the es
sence of the American way of
life. Personal contracts are the
bulwarks of American society.

Editor, The Daily:
Following is a list of "the most
important suggestions concerning
the method of proctoring exami
nations" from a large Eastern
university:
1. Proctors should be in the
room assigned at least 15 minutes
before the examination begins so
that when the hour arrives exami
nation papers can be distributed
quickly and proctors will already

have been assigned to their desig
nated stations in the room. They
should observe cases of certain
groups who come early and sit
together, forming individual
cliques.
2. As students arrive for the
examination, they should be in
stinct ed to leave all books, papers,
notebooks, or any other material
of this sort at some point in the
room selected in advance for that
purpose. No student should be
permited to have this material at
his seat in the room.
3. Have as few public announce
ments as possible. When neces
sary they should be marie by the
instructor in charge.
4. If a student wants to leave
the room he should have a proctor
with him.
5. After the examination be
gins, a proctor should be assigned
to each door leading into the room
so that students arriving late may
receive their examination papers
immediately.
6. Each proctor, assigned to a
definite part of the room, should
move about in such a way that he
will at all times have a view of
the group under his supervision.
7. When a student asks a ques
tion regarding the examination,
the proctor should signal the per
son in charge of the examination
who should make all interpreta
tions and answer all questions
pertaining to the examination.
8. At the conclusion of the ex
amination, each exit from the
room should be covered by a proc
tor who will see that no one
leaves the room without leaving
an examination paper unless he
has made proper explanation
therefore to the instructor in
charge.
9. If the proctor has reason to
suspect that cheating is taking

place but is not in a position to
prove it, the proctor should im
mediately move the person or per
sons whom he thinks responsible.
It should be explained to the stu
dent under these circumstances
that he is being moved for his
own protection. The proctor
should remember that proof is not
needed but suspicion alone is
enough in a case of this kind.
10. When no evidence of cheat
ing has developed, it is advisable
to have the proctor appear, not
as a policeman, but as a servant,
because if you are looking for
trouble you will get it. There are
a number of services proctors
can render.
11. If you suspect cheating, but
have no evidence, one of the best
formulas to use is to speak to the
persons suspected on some pre

text, note the names involved, and
check the papers as they are
turned in for likenesses.
12. When a proctor observes a
student cribbing in any way what
soever. he must be absolutely sure
of his facts before making an ac
cusation of any kind. It' the crib
involves a piece of paper he
should request the student to
hand it to him at once. Act quick
ly so that the student will not
have an opportunity to get the
crib into a pocket or pocket-book,
as would bo the case if the proc
tor went to call someone else.
13. All cases of cribbing should
be reported to the instructor and
a further report should be made
by the proctor to the Registrar
who will refer the case to ihe
Scholarship Comm ill ee,
