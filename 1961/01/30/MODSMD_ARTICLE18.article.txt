# Stanford Fighters Whip Cal Poly
## Boxers Score Close Decision For First Win 
### PETE CRAWFORD 
Stanford's boxing team won
their first dual meet of the season
by defeating Cal Poly 4 1 •» to 3 la.
The score, however, was not in
dicative of the meet as most of
the Card fighters won their
matches easily. The Tribe for
feited two matches.
At 12.1 Steve Morris handily
won every round against Jerrold
Gebbie of Cal Poly and gained a
unanimous decision. Gebbie was
unable to take advantage of his
longer reach and in the first and
thirds rounds was repeatedly
tagged by Morris.
IK IF TOMPKINS at 139 fol
lowed up Morris's victory by scor
ing a TKO over Frank Godinez
of Cal Poly in the third round.
Tompkins used superior experi
ence and speed to register the
TKO with a hard straight right.
At 147 Chuck Keller of Stanford
defeated the Mustangs' Clayton
Oilar. Keller was somewhat handi
capped by his lack of experience,
but after a mediocre first round
he decisively won the second and
third in a strong finish.
The big surprise of the evening
took place when the Indians'
Bruce Bellows was TKO'd by
Bob Gow of Cal Poly in the 156
weight division. Bellow s was
forced into the ropes and was un
able to out slug the stronger Cal
Poly boxer.
TALTON RAY of Stanford
drew with the visitors' Bob La-
Bell in the light heavyweight di

vision. Tall on forced Ihe fight in
all three rounds and landed the
heavier punches, and it seemed as
t hough he had easily won the de
cision.
In Ihe heavyweight division
Rothman beat Oscar Axum by
a decision in an exhibition match.
Axum appeared to win the first
round, but Rothman's savage

body attack took its toll in the
second and third as Axum re
peatedly held in an effort to
avoid further punishment.
Stanford's next home meet will
feature Chico State College on
Feb. 18. The Indians will be out
for revenge as Chico was ihe
only opponent to beat them last
year.
