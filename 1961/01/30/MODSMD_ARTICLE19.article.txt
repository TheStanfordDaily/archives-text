# WIN THIRD IN ROW
## Reid Kicks Indian Ruggers To 6-3 Win Over 'O' Club 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford's rugby team won their third straight as the Card ruggers squeezed out a tight 6-3 win
over the San Francisco Olympic Club on the Indian rugby field Saturday.
Kyrk Reid accounted for all of the Tribe's scoring by hooting two penalty kicks for six points.
The first half of the contest was marked, as was the entire game, by stiff defensive action. The
Olympic Clubbers were able 1o control the ball enough to stop the Indians' fast backs from scor-

ing, but couldn't move the ball
through (he tough Card forwards.
WITH SEVEN minutes gone in
Ihe first period, the Tribe had a
chance Jo score three points on a
penalty kick, but Reid's boot fell
short, and no further point
making opportunities came until
Reid got another chance to boost
the Cards into a three-point lead
with only two minutes left in the
half. This time the kick was per
fect, splitting the uprights from
45 yards out.
The second stanza was marked
by some brilliant Stanford run
ning, most of it done by center
: U Rick MoMillen.
One time McMillen took a long
pass from a lineout and raced 3."5
yards before the Winged "O" de
fense caught up.
TIIE INDIANS' best chance for
a try came when fullback Rod
Sears fielded a punt about ten
yards from his end zone and
sprinted through the San Fran
ciscans to the midfield stripe
where he flipped the ball back to
McMillen, who advanced to with
in 15 yards of pavdirt before hav
ing to pass off to Tim Hansel, who
was finally stopped only five
yards short of scoring.
Another time the Indians got to
within a yard of scoring territory,
but were unable to push it over.
Action shifted to the other end
of the field as the Olympic Club
bers got two penalty kicks within
minutes of each other, the second
of which was good, being booted
25 yards by the visitors' Dave
Marselli.
TIIE SURE-FOOTED Reid
brought the Tribe back into tho
front again when he banged
through a 25-yard penalty kick
after earlier missing another 25
yarder.
The San Franciscans got one
last chance to tie up the contest
with a penalty boot, but it was
wide, and shortly after the Cards
had won their third straight.
The Stanford scrum, facing
their stiffest opposition of the
year, more than held their own
against the taller and more ex
perienced Olympic Club, and it
was their hard-nosed play which
kept the visitors from dominating
the contest.
Card mentor Pete Kmetovie
was extremely happy with his
team's play, especially that of the
scrum, and named front ranker
Dick Hall, second ranker Troy
Barbee, and breakaway Jack Me-
Cullough as outstanding.
AMONG TIIE backs, McMillen
was the stickout, also drawing
praise from Kmetovie.
