RECIFE, Brazil tUPD — The rebels aboard the hijacked Portuguese liner Santa Maria yesterday
received word the incoming Brazilian administration will welcome tbem as friends and guarantee them
and the ship refuge in a northern port tomorrow.
The vessel slowed its speedy dash across the Atlantic toward a landfall, and all signs pointed to a
landing tomorrow either at Recife or Salvador, 400 miles down the coast, to disembark the 620 cap-

I tive passengers, including 42'
| Americans.
IT WAS LAST sighted 30 miles j
I off Recife, headed south at slow ;
speed.
Portugal's answer to this was a j
I vow to capture the ship, by force j
if necessary, after the passengers •
112 have been removed,
ii
I Portuguese strongman Premier j
j Antonio de Oliveira Salazar's em-1
' bassy in Brazil registered a for
j mal protest against "excessive j
; liberty" for anti-Salazar exile lead
|er Humberto Delgado, master->
mind of the ship seizure one week |
j ago last night.
U.S. NAVY vessels, including j
j the atomic submarine Seawolf,
maintained vigil to protect the
i lives of the passengers at the
: mercy of swashbuckling rebel
j Henrique Galvao and a band of
| 70 Portuguese and Spaniards.
The Brazilian navy base at
Recife planned to send the cor
vette Ipiranga to rendezvous with
the Santa Maria off northern
Brazil, where it has been circling, i
The U.S. Navy also had plans
to send the destroyer Wilson to
j a rendezvous.
U.S. Caribbean Sea Frontier!
. Commander Rear Adm. Allen
Smith Jr., flew from Belem,
I Brazil, to Recife to help negotiate
with the rebels and to try to win
! speedy removal of the passengers.
THE NEWSPAPER Diario De
| Noticias in Rio de Janeiro quoted
i incoming President Janio Quadros .
i as saying he would give the ship
| "all guarantees."
The unpredictable Quadros, sue
l eeeding President Juscelino Ku
: bitschek, will take office for four
' years tomorrow.
Me had returned to Brazil only j
| last week from a European tour j
'which included a lengthy visit to
; Lisbon.
i"I think the ship will arrive in j
Recife or Salvador after I take
office Feb. 1," the paper quoted
Quadros as saying. It said he
called rebel leader Galvao "an old
j friend.
"I will not deliver the Santa j
j Maria to Portugal. And if the ship
i comes to Brazil I will give her all
i guarantees."
THIS WOULD be a blow to Por
tugal. The Santa Maria, built in
1953, is a multi-million dollar ves
sel and a mainstay of the Portu
guese maritime service.

for Miami, the final port of call

planes flew to Recife to use the
Northern Brazilian port as a base
! for tracking the ship.
