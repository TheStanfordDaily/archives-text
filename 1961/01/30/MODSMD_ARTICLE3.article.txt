# Hoover Named To New Post
## 
### 
Former President Herbert Hoo
ver and three long-time Stanford
trustees recently have been elec
ted to the status of trustees eme
ritus.
Hoover, former State Supreme
Court Justice Homer R. Spcnce,
James B. Black, chairman of the
board of Pacific Gas and Electric
Co., and Ira S. Lillick, San Fran
cisco attorney, all submitted their
resignations at the board's Jan.
19 meeting in Los Angeles.
THE RESIGNATIONS were ac
cepted but the board immediately
acted to make the four trustees
emeritus.
Emeritus members of the Board
of Trustees continue to serve the
board on committees, but no
longer cast votes with the board.
The emeritus trustees are eligible
to vote on the board committees,
however.
HOOVER'S 49-year term is the
second longest in board history.
The record is held by Timothy
Hopkins, who served 51 years.
The Board of Trustees was
formed in 1885.
Lillick will continue to serve as
secretary and treasurer in an eme
ritus capacity. He has been a
member of the Board of Trustees
since 1923.
It is traditional that long-time
trustees of Stanford make way
for younger men.
