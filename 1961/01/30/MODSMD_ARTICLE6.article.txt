# No Decision on ATO Case; Hearing 'Disappoints' Frat
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Stanford's embattled Alpha Tau Omega fraternity emerged from a healing before national officers
Saturday still retaining its national charter but "unhappy to learn" that its case will be judged solely
on a transcript of the proceedings.
Chapter President Mike Kavanaugh, in a statement released last night, said "it is imperative thai
the decision" on whether the local chapter will loose its national charter for pledging four Jews be

made by March 15, "since rushing
begins soon after."
THE STATEMENT declared,
however, that "whatever the de
cision of (he (national) High
Council, this chapter will continue
to choose men solely for their in
dividual merits."
Kavanaugh also said "a great
many encouraging statements of
support from well-wishers make
it hard for us to believe that the
national officers can long con
tinue to ignore a rising tide of
opinion that demands an end to
the restrictive membership
clauses of the kind found in this
and other fraternities."
NO DECISION on the matter
was made Saturday. This will
come sometime in the next few
months when the five-man ATO
national council will meet, re
view the transcript of the hearing
and presumably make its deci
sion.
Kavanaugh's statement noted
the local Beta Psi chapter was
"surprised and disappointed that
contrary to our original be
liefs, this was not a meeting of
the entire High Council"and that
only one member of the council,
its chairman, Hubert Garrecht of
Memphis, Tenn., was present.
The statement said "this made
any decisive action impossible
and . . . changed the entire nature
of the meeting itself. We were
unhappy to learn that this case
will be judged from a transcript
of the proceedings. . . .
"THIS transcript, we feel, may
not communicate the diverse and
extensive nature of our support,"
Kavanaugh's statement declared.
He said "The alumni of Beta
Psi arc practically unanimous in
their active support of our stand."
Of more than 400 alumni con
tacted, more than 100 replied, he
said. Of those at the hearing, "less
than 10 were critical of the stand
we had made.
"Also, the presidents of several
western universities expressed to
us their wholehearted endorse
ment of our position."
He said the local was "grati
fied" by the presentation to it
Saturday of a petition signed by
more than 500 Stanford freshmen
"upholding the principles to which
Bela Psi adheres."
THE STATEMENT noted that
"If, for some reason, and we can
not imagine what it might be, the
decision is delayed beyond March
15, we hope it is forthcoming be
fore the summer months, en
abling our reorganization," before
the ATOs break up for vacation.
At Saturday's hearing, Garrecht
said he had "no idea" when a de
cision on (he case would be made,
but that it would be a while. He
conducted the hearing, he said,
with "an open mind" and was
just trying to find out the facts
and take the testimony back to
the national council.
Gerald K. Johnson, grand
worthy master of the national
who also was present, explained
the restrictive clause in the na
tional constitution, saying, "We
don't exclude Jews if they cm
brace the Christian faith."
