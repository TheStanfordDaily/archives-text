# THURSDAY EVENING
## Encina Diners Hit by Mild Food Poisoning 
### 
Only the bad memory remained yesterday for almost 100 stu
dents who were stricken by mild food poisoning following a meal at
Encina Dining Hall Thursday evening.
Almost all of the diners, mostly graduate students, were reported
recovered and back in class Friday morning.
Exact cause of the food poisoning has not been determined, but

University health officials sus
pect that string beans served for
dinner may have been spoiled.
THE ENCINA outbreak was the
second major incident of the kind
at Stanford within five days.
Twenty-nine girls, hashers and
the cook at Durand House fell ill
Jan. 21 as a result of eating
spoiled short-ribs.
A â€¢spokesman for the Santa
Clara County Health Department
said that about one-fifth of the
students who ate the Encina meal
were affected.
Five health service physicians
treated stricken students at Mari
posa and the Oaks (graduate
women's houses on campus),
Stanford Village, Crothers Hall
and Crothers Memorial Hall be
tween 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Many of
the students also went to the
Stanford-Palo Alto Hospital for
treatment.
Delay of more than an hour in
treating the stricken students was
caused by a new switchboard op
erator who was not familiar with
procedure in such emergencies.
Although widespread, the at
tack was relatively mild and was
quickly controlled, a University
spokesman said.
DINNER AT Encina Thursday
night included pork chops, mashed
potatoes, string beans, fruit cup
and sherbet. Because three Indian
students who are vegetarians
also fell sick, the cause has been
narrowed to the mashed potatoes
and the string beans.
Hal Wilson, University health
; officer, is conducting an investi
gation to determine the exact
j cause. Results of the tests will
be known in about five days.
