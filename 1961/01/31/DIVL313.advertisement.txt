TO DISCUSS CARTERS IN
Scientific Computer Programming
WITH STL REPRESENTATIVES, ON-CAMPUS
February 2, 3, 1961
Challenging new problems in the areas of aerodynamics,
celestial mechanics, tracking and trajectory analysis, sys
tems simulation, and test evaluation require individuals
with more than the usual inclination toward, and qualifi
cations in, computer-oriented mathematics.
Space Technology Laboratories' Computation and Data
Reduction Center, located in Southern California, is one
of the nation's largest and most advanced computational
facilities. Its staff members daily utilize two IBM 7090's
and sophisticated data reduction systems to solve problems
arising in the Air Force ballistic missile program and
and space flight studies.
STL offers opportunity for:,association with a superior
technical staff headed by progressive management; partici
pation in unusually challenging computation and data
reduction problems; professional growth; and for advance
ment within a stimulating and creative environment.
