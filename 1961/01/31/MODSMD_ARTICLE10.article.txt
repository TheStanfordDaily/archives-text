# JFK Sees Nation Facing Two-Year Economic Slump
## Gloom Marks State of Union 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Presi
dent Kennedy said yesterday the
nation is facing a two-year eco
nomic slump and world problems
so staggering that time for their
solution could bo running out. He
warned that "while hoping for the
best, we should prepare ourselves
for the worst."
But while predicting that "the
news will be worse before it is
better," he said his administration
is outlining a vigorous course of
action to deal both with domestic
problems and international crises.
In a blunt and often black re
port on the state of the union,
Kennedy told Congress:
"I SPEAK today in an hour of
national peril and national oppor
tunity.
"Before my term has ended, we
shall have to test anew whether a
nation organized and governed
such as ours can endure. The out
come is by no means certain. The
answers are by no means clear.
All of us—the administration, this
Congress, this nation—must forge
those answers."
In his review of international
problems he said: "Each day the
crises multiply. Each day their
solution grows more difficult.
Each day we draw nearer the
hour of maximum danger, as wea
pons spread and hostile forces
grow stronger.
"I FEEL I must inform the con
gress that our analyses over the
last ten days make it clear that
in each of these principal areas of
crisis—the tide of events has been
running out and time has not
been our friend."
He said that "no man, entering
upon this office, regardless of his
party, regardless of his previous
service in Washington, could fail
to be staggered upon learning -
even in this brief 10-day period —
the harsh enormity of the trials
through which we must pass in
the next four years."
To fight this, Kennedy came up
with a series of proposals ranging
from measures to counteract the
recession to plans for the prompt
acceleration of the whole U.S. mis
sile program and the polaris sub
marine programs.
"We cannot escape our dangers
—neither must we let them drive
us to panic or narrow isolation.
". . . Life in 1961 will not be
easy. Wishing it, predicting it,
even asking for it, will not make
it so. There will be further set
backs before the tide is turned.
But turn it must. The hopes of
all mankind rest upon us. . .
TIIE SOBER world picture out
lined by President Kennedy re
ceived a congressional reception
ranging from unstinted Demo
cratic praise to Republican cries
of indignation.
Democrats wore nearly unani
mous in approving what Kennedy
said. Republicans, for the most
part, were against it. Some were
aghast.
Chairman Styles Bridges of the
Senate GOP Policy Committee,
fast becoming one of Kennedy's
most vocal critics, called it "a
classic example of the gloom and
doom philosophy" and a disserv
ice to the nation.

Senate GOP Policy Committee,

most vocal critics, called it "a
classic example of the gloom and

WASHINGTON (UPI) Presi
dent Kennedy said yesterday the
nation is facing a two-year eco
nomic slump and world problems
so staggering that time for their
solution could bo running out. He
warned that "while hoping for the
best, we should prepare ourselves
for the worst."
But while predicting that "the
news will be worse before it is
better," he said his administration
is outlining a vigorous course of
action to deal both with domestic
problems and international crises.
In a blunt and often black re
port on the state of the union,
Kennedy told Congress:
"I SPEAK today in an hour of
national peril and national oppor
tunity.
"Before my term has ended, we
shall have to test anew whether a
nation organized and governed
such as ours can endure. The out
come is by no means certain. The
answers are by no means clear.
All of us—the administration, this
Congress, this nation—must forge
those answers."
In his review of international
problems he said: "Each day the
crises multiply. Each day their
solution grows more difficult.
Each day we draw nearer the
hour of maximum danger, as wea
pons spread and hostile forces
grow stronger.
"I FEEL I must inform the con
gress that our analyses over the
last ten days make it clear that
in each of these principal areas of
crisis—the tide of events has been
running out and time has not
been our friend."
He said that "no man, entering
upon this office, regardless of his
party, regardless of his previous
service in Washington, could fail
to be staggered upon learning -
even in this brief 10-day period —
the harsh enormity of the trials
through which we must pass in
the next four years."
To fight this, Kennedy came up
with a series of proposals ranging
from measures to counteract the
recession to plans for the prompt
acceleration of the whole U.S. mis
sile program and the polaris sub
marine programs.
"We cannot escape our dangers
—neither must we let them drive
us to panic or narrow isolation.
". . . Life in 1961 will not be
easy. Wishing it, predicting it,
even asking for it, will not make
it so. There will be further set
backs before the tide is turned.
But turn it must. The hopes of
all mankind rest upon us. . .
