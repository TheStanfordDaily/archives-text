The present conflict of Stanford's chapter of ATO with tlieir
national has brought to the fore one of llie main reasons that
fraternities in many parts of lite country are fighting for tlieir
very survival.
Although discriminations of ability, personality and social
class exist in almost every phase of life, the American people
are slowly coming to realize that discrimination of race or religion
is inconsistent with the ideals of freedom and liberty which this
country so proudly preaches to the world.
The danger to fraternities is evident in such unfortunate com
ments as were reported in yesterday's Daily. The quote of ATO's
worthy master, "We don't exclude Jews —if they embrace the
Christian faith," shows a remarkable ignorance or naivete and
seems to imply that there is only one religion which reflects the
principles of ATO, whatever (hey may he.
And Mr. Delano's assertion that the right of discrimination
among race and religion in association is a God-given right and
part of the American way of life is as frightening as it is disgust
ing. Both of these men apparently hold the assumption that
fraternalism cannot exist among different colors and creeds—a
sad tenet in an America that is proclaiming a desire for friend
ship and equality to the rest of the world which is, in large
majority, non-white and non-Christian.
If there is a place for fraternities on university campuses their
survival will be assured only if they decry the anachronism of
racial and religious discrimination and practice the fraternal
spirit which they profess,
