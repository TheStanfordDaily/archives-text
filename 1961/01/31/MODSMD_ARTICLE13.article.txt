# Communist Stratagem
## 
### MARSHALL BROWN HR Political Analyst 
In November. 1960, the eighty
one Communist; parties of the
World met in Moscow; from this
meeting emerged a "Second Com
munist Manifesto:" a statement
of the historical situation in the
world today; the position of the
Communists with regard to this
situation; and the intentions of
the Communists to alter it.
According to this Manifesto, the
world power balance has shifted
in favor of socialism; world war
is now no longer necessary to
establish a world Socialist system.
Thus, the only correct basis for
relations among states with dif
ferent social systems is peaceful
coexistence.
However, peaceful coexistence
and the renunciation of the inevit
ability of world war does not im
ply the renunciation of the class
struggle; Communists may seize
power by peaceful or non-peaceful
means, depending upon the local
circumstances.
This duality of means has been
reflected in the traditional bifur
cation of the foreign policy of the
Soviet Union: seeking on one level
diplomatic respectability; and on
the other, world revolution, the
latter often operating secretly.
Recent Communist activities in
Latin America indicate that the
great emphasis is on diplomatic
respectability; apparently the So
viet policy-makers have concluded
that, in the long run, this tactic
will best serve the interests of the
world revolutionary movement.
In the November Manifesto it
was stated explicitly that "the
Communist parties have always
been against the export of revolu
tion" and that "the choice of so
cial systems is the inalienable
right of the people of each coun
try." In accord wilh these declara
tions the strategy of the Soviet
Union in the Western Hemisphere
is the ideological neutralization of
Latin America—as the first step
in the eventual transition to so
cialism.
Lenin could not emphasize
enough the importance of using
the appropriate tactics for each
revolutionary situation; in pro
moting the neutralization of the
Latin American countries —rather
than fostering violent revolu
tion —the Communists seem, in
deed, to be exploiting to the ut
most the ebb stage of the revo
lutionary tide; once this neutral
ization has been accomplished,
th*n the tide will begin to turn,
and with this change will flow in
the triumph of socialism.
The basic tactic employed by

the Soviet Union at present in
Latin America is what might be
termed "image manipulation."
The Communists are seeking to
undermine United States influ
ence and prestige by building up
distrust and hostility towards
America through "exposure" of
Yankee imperialism; they are
simultaneously endeavoring to
create a favorable image of the
USSR and the rest of the Commu
nist bloc—an image of power,
progress and benevolence.
However, the efforts of the
Communist bloc to create friendly,
if not influential, relations with
the Latin American governments
necessarily restricts their ability
to actively direct or participate in
revolutionary activities in these
Countries; thus the revolutionary
tactics are primarily consigned to
the "social reformers in Havana"
who, while serving as an ideal
front for the clandestine branch
of Soviet foreign policy, can ex
port a revolution to the masses
without directly involving the
Communist bloc.
In keeping with the November
Manifesto —which demanded that
the Communist and social-demo
cratic forces take joint action 011
a national and international scale
—the local Communist parties are
trying to build a posture of re
spectability, endeavoring to blend
into the political, social and eco
nomic life of their respective
countries.
The local Communist parties,
the tactical support for the stra
tegic offense, have instructions to
infillrate and control labor or
ganizations, student associations,
professional groups, press associ
ations, and other groups influ
ential in molding public opinion.
The present membership of the
Latin American Communist par
ties is estimate to range between
210,000 and 230,000, a considerable
decrease from the estimated 500,-
000 members in 1947. From such
facts it becomes evident that the
present policy is not to build or
to attract mass membership, but
rather to maintain compact, dedi
cated and well-trained cadres who
are able to manipulate the atti
tude of the people towards the
Soviet Union and the U.S.
However, it should be stressed
that this policy of ideological neu
tralization is not an absolute com
mitment, but rather only what
appears most expedient under
present conditions. If this policy
fails to achieve the desired ends,
the United States can well expect
to see a shift in emphasis in Latin
America— a retreat for respecti
ve diplomacy and a turn toward
1 revolutionary agitation.

In November. 1960, the eighty
one Communist; parties of the
World met in Moscow; from this
meeting emerged a "Second Com
munist Manifesto:" a statement
of the historical situation in the
world today; the position of the
Communists with regard to this
situation; and the intentions of
the Communists to alter it.
According to this Manifesto, the
world power balance has shifted
in favor of socialism; world war
is now no longer necessary to
establish a world Socialist system.
Thus, the only correct basis for
relations among states with dif
ferent social systems is peaceful
coexistence.
However, peaceful coexistence
and the renunciation of the inevit
ability of world war does not im
ply the renunciation of the class
struggle; Communists may seize
power by peaceful or non-peaceful
means, depending upon the local
circumstances.
This duality of means has been
reflected in the traditional bifur
cation of the foreign policy of the
Soviet Union: seeking on one level
diplomatic respectability; and on
the other, world revolution, the
latter often operating secretly.
Recent Communist activities in
Latin America indicate that the
great emphasis is on diplomatic
respectability; apparently the So
viet policy-makers have concluded
that, in the long run, this tactic
will best serve the interests of the
world revolutionary movement.
In the November Manifesto it
was stated explicitly that "the
Communist parties have always
been against the export of revolu
tion" and that "the choice of so
cial systems is the inalienable
right of the people of each coun
try." In accord wilh these declara
tions the strategy of the Soviet
Union in the Western Hemisphere
is the ideological neutralization of
Latin America—as the first step
in the eventual transition to so
cialism.
Lenin could not emphasize
enough the importance of using
the appropriate tactics for each
revolutionary situation; in pro
moting the neutralization of the
Latin American countries —rather
than fostering violent revolu
tion —the Communists seem, in
deed, to be exploiting to the ut
most the ebb stage of the revo
lutionary tide; once this neutral
ization has been accomplished,
th*n the tide will begin to turn,
and with this change will flow in
the triumph of socialism.
The basic tactic employed by

the Soviet Union at present in
Latin America is what might be
termed "image manipulation."
The Communists are seeking to
undermine United States influ
ence and prestige by building up
distrust and hostility towards
America through "exposure" of
Yankee imperialism; they are
simultaneously endeavoring to
create a favorable image of the
USSR and the rest of the Commu
nist bloc—an image of power,
progress and benevolence.
However, the efforts of the
Communist bloc to create friendly,
if not influential, relations with
the Latin American governments
necessarily restricts their ability
to actively direct or participate in
revolutionary activities in these
Countries; thus the revolutionary
tactics are primarily consigned to
the "social reformers in Havana"
who, while serving as an ideal
front for the clandestine branch
of Soviet foreign policy, can ex
port a revolution to the masses
without directly involving the
Communist bloc.
In keeping with the November
Manifesto —which demanded that
the Communist and social-demo
cratic forces take joint action 011
a national and international scale
—the local Communist parties are
trying to build a posture of re
spectability, endeavoring to blend
into the political, social and eco
nomic life of their respective
countries.
The local Communist parties,
the tactical support for the stra
tegic offense, have instructions to
infillrate and control labor or
ganizations, student associations,
professional groups, press associ
ations, and other groups influ
ential in molding public opinion.
The present membership of the
Latin American Communist par
ties is estimate to range between
210,000 and 230,000, a considerable
decrease from the estimated 500,-
000 members in 1947. From such
facts it becomes evident that the
present policy is not to build or
to attract mass membership, but
rather to maintain compact, dedi
cated and well-trained cadres who
are able to manipulate the atti
tude of the people towards the
Soviet Union and the U.S.
However, it should be stressed
that this policy of ideological neu
tralization is not an absolute com
mitment, but rather only what
appears most expedient under
present conditions. If this policy
fails to achieve the desired ends,
the United States can well expect

The present membership of the
Latin American Communist par
ties is estimate to range between
210,000 and 230,000, a considerable
decrease from the estimated 500,-
000 members in 1947. From such
facts it becomes evident that the
present policy is not to build or
to attract mass membership, but
rather to maintain compact, dedi
cated and well-trained cadres who
are able to manipulate the atti
tude of the people towards the
Soviet Union and the U.S.
However, it should be stressed
that this policy of ideological neu
tralization is not an absolute com
mitment, but rather only what
appears most expedient under
present conditions. If this policy
fails to achieve the desired ends,
the United States can well expect
to see a shift in emphasis in Latin
America— a retreat for respecti

In November. 1960, the eighty
one Communist; parties of the
World met in Moscow; from this
meeting emerged a "Second Com
munist Manifesto:" a statement
of the historical situation in the
world today; the position of the
Communists with regard to this
situation; and the intentions of
the Communists to alter it.
According to this Manifesto, the
world power balance has shifted
in favor of socialism; world war
is now no longer necessary to
establish a world Socialist system.
Thus, the only correct basis for
relations among states with dif
ferent social systems is peaceful
coexistence.
However, peaceful coexistence
and the renunciation of the inevit
ability of world war does not im
ply the renunciation of the class
struggle; Communists may seize
power by peaceful or non-peaceful
means, depending upon the local
circumstances.
This duality of means has been
reflected in the traditional bifur
cation of the foreign policy of the
Soviet Union: seeking on one level
diplomatic respectability; and on
the other, world revolution, the
latter often operating secretly.
Recent Communist activities in
Latin America indicate that the
great emphasis is on diplomatic
respectability; apparently the So
viet policy-makers have concluded
that, in the long run, this tactic
will best serve the interests of the
world revolutionary movement.
In the November Manifesto it
was stated explicitly that "the
Communist parties have always
been against the export of revolu
tion" and that "the choice of so
cial systems is the inalienable
right of the people of each coun
try." In accord wilh these declara
tions the strategy of the Soviet
Union in the Western Hemisphere
is the ideological neutralization of
Latin America—as the first step
in the eventual transition to so
cialism.
Lenin could not emphasize
enough the importance of using
the appropriate tactics for each
revolutionary situation; in pro
moting the neutralization of the
Latin American countries —rather
than fostering violent revolu
tion —the Communists seem, in
deed, to be exploiting to the ut
most the ebb stage of the revo
lutionary tide; once this neutral
ization has been accomplished,
th*n the tide will begin to turn,
and with this change will flow in
the triumph of socialism.
The basic tactic employed by

the Soviet Union at present in
Latin America is what might be
termed "image manipulation."
The Communists are seeking to
undermine United States influ
ence and prestige by building up
distrust and hostility towards
America through "exposure" of
Yankee imperialism; they are
simultaneously endeavoring to
create a favorable image of the
USSR and the rest of the Commu
nist bloc—an image of power,
progress and benevolence.
However, the efforts of the
Communist bloc to create friendly,
if not influential, relations with
the Latin American governments
necessarily restricts their ability
to actively direct or participate in
revolutionary activities in these
Countries; thus the revolutionary
tactics are primarily consigned to
the "social reformers in Havana"
who, while serving as an ideal
front for the clandestine branch
of Soviet foreign policy, can ex
port a revolution to the masses
without directly involving the
Communist bloc.
In keeping with the November
Manifesto —which demanded that
the Communist and social-demo
cratic forces take joint action 011
a national and international scale
—the local Communist parties are
trying to build a posture of re
spectability, endeavoring to blend
into the political, social and eco
nomic life of their respective
countries.
