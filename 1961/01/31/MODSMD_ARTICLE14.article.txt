### EUGENE WU Curator, Chinese Collection 
(Editor's Note: This is the fifth
in a series of articles on the
Hoover Institution on War, Revo
lution, and Peace. Today's article
is about the Chinese Collection.)

The Chinese Collection of Ihe
Hoover Institution specializes in
sources for ihe study of modern
history, modern literature, and
the social sciences, with major at
tention to the growth of political
movements and the processes of
social and economic change. The
Chinese Collection also includes
the excellent, if relative small,
working collection in the fields
of traditional Chinese history,
philosophy, and literature for
merly housed in the Stanford
University Library.
The vast majority of Chinese
language materials in the Hoover
Institution are primary and docu
mentary in nature. At present this
collection has an estimated total
of 50,000 titles in approximately
60,000 volumes. Materials on
China in other languages, includ
ing Russian and Japanese, total
about 5,150 titles. The Chinese
Collection also has a periodicals
collection of approximately 3,000
titles of varying frequency and
670 newspaper titles covering the
period since 1900.
As a result of restrictions im
posed on the export of printed ma
terials by the Chinese Communist
government acquisitions of cur
rent China Mainland publications
have become increasingly diffi
cult. The Chinese Collection is
currently checking in 24 periodi
cals from the Mainland as against
62 in 1960 and 160 in 1959, and 2
newspapers as against 8 last year.
However, the Hoover Institu
tion's collection of Chinese Com
munist source materials is unique.
There are the Harold Isaacs Col
lection, the Nym Wales (Mrs.
Edgar Snow) Collection, and the
Vice President Chen Cheng Col
lection. Together they provide an
excellent and rare coverage of
the history of Chinese Commu
nism from the founding of the
Party in 1921 to the eve of the
Japanese invasion in 1937. The
Isaacs Collection includes some of
the only copies of CCP's under
ground publications during the
early 1930'5.
The Vice President Chen Cheng
Collection consists of captured
Communist documents dealing
exclusively with the "Chinese So
viet Republic," 1931-1934. This
collection was microfilmed re
cently for the Hoover Institution.
It is the first time this group of
highly important source mate
rials, in most cases the only

copies, have been made available
to Western scholars for research.
The Nym Wales Collection in
cludes the originals of a number
of hitherto unknown CCP policy
documents, unique files of party
journals, etc., of the early Yenan
period immediately following the
Long March in 1934 and before
the Chinese-Japanese War in 1937.
To augment the above men
tioned materials there are thou
sands of important Individual
items including Mao Tse-tung's
writings, Party proclamations,
etc., as well as a generous supply
of intelligence reference materials
compiled by the Nationalist Gov
ernment on Taiwan and declassi
fied for the Hoover Institution for
research purposes.
The Hoover Institution has a
rich collection of materials on
the Kuomintang also. We have,
perhaps, the only complete file in
the Western World of the early
organ of the Kuomintang, the
"Min-li pao," 1910-13. All of Dr.
Sun Yet-sen's writings, speeches,
etc., as well as those by Chiang
Kai-shek, are in the Institution's
collection.
Bulletins or gazettes on the eco
nomic and political conditions on
the island of Taiwan issued by
various government organs are
also available in the Chinese Col
lection. They constitute the most
important collection of documents
for study of both the Nationalist
government on Taiwan and the
Taiwan Provincial Administra
tion.
In addition to political move
ments, materials relating to eco
nomic, social, and cultural de
velopments of 20th Century China
are abundantly available for study
in the Chinese Collection.
Other types of source materials,
such as diaries and personal pa
pers, are also entrusted to our
care. The Hoover Institution is
in possession of the late General
Joseph Stilwell's diaries; and the
diaries of the late Professor Hu
bert G. Kchenck which cover the
years while he was on General
Mac Arthur's staff in SCAP and,
later, Director of the EC A pro
gram in Taiwan.

The Chinese Collection of Ihe
Hoover Institution specializes in
sources for ihe study of modern
history, modern literature, and
the social sciences, with major at
tention to the growth of political
movements and the processes of
social and economic change. The
Chinese Collection also includes
the excellent, if relative small,
working collection in the fields
of traditional Chinese history,
philosophy, and literature for
merly housed in the Stanford
University Library.
The vast majority of Chinese
language materials in the Hoover
Institution are primary and docu
mentary in nature. At present this
collection has an estimated total
of 50,000 titles in approximately
60,000 volumes. Materials on
China in other languages, includ
ing Russian and Japanese, total
about 5,150 titles. The Chinese
Collection also has a periodicals
collection of approximately 3,000
titles of varying frequency and
670 newspaper titles covering the
period since 1900.
As a result of restrictions im
posed on the export of printed ma
terials by the Chinese Communist
government acquisitions of cur
rent China Mainland publications
have become increasingly diffi
cult. The Chinese Collection is
currently checking in 24 periodi
cals from the Mainland as against
62 in 1960 and 160 in 1959, and 2
newspapers as against 8 last year.
However, the Hoover Institu
tion's collection of Chinese Com
munist source materials is unique.
There are the Harold Isaacs Col
lection, the Nym Wales (Mrs.
Edgar Snow) Collection, and the
Vice President Chen Cheng Col
lection. Together they provide an
excellent and rare coverage of
the history of Chinese Commu
nism from the founding of the
Party in 1921 to the eve of the
Japanese invasion in 1937. The
Isaacs Collection includes some of
the only copies of CCP's under
ground publications during the
early 1930'5.
The Vice President Chen Cheng
Collection consists of captured
Communist documents dealing
exclusively with the "Chinese So
viet Republic," 1931-1934. This
collection was microfilmed re
cently for the Hoover Institution.
It is the first time this group of
highly important source mate
rials, in most cases the only

copies, have been made available
to Western scholars for research.
The Nym Wales Collection in
cludes the originals of a number
of hitherto unknown CCP policy
documents, unique files of party
journals, etc., of the early Yenan
period immediately following the
Long March in 1934 and before
the Chinese-Japanese War in 1937.
To augment the above men
tioned materials there are thou
sands of important Individual
items including Mao Tse-tung's
writings, Party proclamations,
etc., as well as a generous supply
of intelligence reference materials
compiled by the Nationalist Gov
ernment on Taiwan and declassi
fied for the Hoover Institution for
research purposes.
The Hoover Institution has a
rich collection of materials on
the Kuomintang also. We have,
perhaps, the only complete file in
the Western World of the early
organ of the Kuomintang, the
"Min-li pao," 1910-13. All of Dr.
Sun Yet-sen's writings, speeches,
etc., as well as those by Chiang
Kai-shek, are in the Institution's
collection.
Bulletins or gazettes on the eco
nomic and political conditions on
the island of Taiwan issued by
various government organs are
also available in the Chinese Col
lection. They constitute the most
important collection of documents
for study of both the Nationalist
government on Taiwan and the
Taiwan Provincial Administra
tion.
In addition to political move
ments, materials relating to eco
nomic, social, and cultural de
velopments of 20th Century China
are abundantly available for study
in the Chinese Collection.
Other types of source materials,
such as diaries and personal pa
pers, are also entrusted to our
care. The Hoover Institution is
in possession of the late General
Joseph Stilwell's diaries; and the
diaries of the late Professor Hu
bert G. Kchenck which cover the
years while he was on General
Mac Arthur's staff in SCAP and,
later, Director of the EC A pro

in possession of the late General
Joseph Stilwell's diaries; and the
diaries of the late Professor Hu
bert G. Kchenck which cover the
years while he was on General
Mac Arthur's staff in SCAP and,
later, Director of the EC A pro

The Chinese Collection of Ihe
Hoover Institution specializes in
sources for ihe study of modern
history, modern literature, and
the social sciences, with major at
tention to the growth of political
movements and the processes of
social and economic change. The
Chinese Collection also includes
the excellent, if relative small,
working collection in the fields
of traditional Chinese history,
philosophy, and literature for
merly housed in the Stanford
University Library.
The vast majority of Chinese
language materials in the Hoover
Institution are primary and docu
mentary in nature. At present this
collection has an estimated total
of 50,000 titles in approximately
60,000 volumes. Materials on
China in other languages, includ
ing Russian and Japanese, total
about 5,150 titles. The Chinese
Collection also has a periodicals
collection of approximately 3,000
titles of varying frequency and
670 newspaper titles covering the
period since 1900.
As a result of restrictions im
posed on the export of printed ma
terials by the Chinese Communist
government acquisitions of cur
rent China Mainland publications
have become increasingly diffi
cult. The Chinese Collection is
currently checking in 24 periodi
cals from the Mainland as against
62 in 1960 and 160 in 1959, and 2
newspapers as against 8 last year.
However, the Hoover Institu
tion's collection of Chinese Com
munist source materials is unique.
There are the Harold Isaacs Col
lection, the Nym Wales (Mrs.
Edgar Snow) Collection, and the
Vice President Chen Cheng Col
lection. Together they provide an
excellent and rare coverage of
the history of Chinese Commu
nism from the founding of the
Party in 1921 to the eve of the
Japanese invasion in 1937. The
Isaacs Collection includes some of
the only copies of CCP's under
ground publications during the
early 1930'5.
The Vice President Chen Cheng
Collection consists of captured
Communist documents dealing
exclusively with the "Chinese So
viet Republic," 1931-1934. This
collection was microfilmed re
cently for the Hoover Institution.
It is the first time this group of
highly important source mate
rials, in most cases the only

copies, have been made available
to Western scholars for research.
The Nym Wales Collection in
cludes the originals of a number
of hitherto unknown CCP policy
documents, unique files of party
journals, etc., of the early Yenan
period immediately following the
Long March in 1934 and before
the Chinese-Japanese War in 1937.
To augment the above men
tioned materials there are thou
sands of important Individual
items including Mao Tse-tung's
writings, Party proclamations,
etc., as well as a generous supply
of intelligence reference materials
compiled by the Nationalist Gov
ernment on Taiwan and declassi
fied for the Hoover Institution for
research purposes.
The Hoover Institution has a
rich collection of materials on
the Kuomintang also. We have,
perhaps, the only complete file in
the Western World of the early
organ of the Kuomintang, the
"Min-li pao," 1910-13. All of Dr.
Sun Yet-sen's writings, speeches,
etc., as well as those by Chiang
Kai-shek, are in the Institution's
collection.
Bulletins or gazettes on the eco
nomic and political conditions on
the island of Taiwan issued by
various government organs are
also available in the Chinese Col
lection. They constitute the most
important collection of documents
for study of both the Nationalist
government on Taiwan and the
Taiwan Provincial Administra
tion.
In addition to political move
ments, materials relating to eco
nomic, social, and cultural de
velopments of 20th Century China
are abundantly available for study
in the Chinese Collection.
Other types of source materials,
such as diaries and personal pa
pers, are also entrusted to our
care. The Hoover Institution is
in possession of the late General
Joseph Stilwell's diaries; and the
diaries of the late Professor Hu
bert G. Kchenck which cover the
years while he was on General
