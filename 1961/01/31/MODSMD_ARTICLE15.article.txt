Editor, The Daily:
In answer to the letters of Men
ehem E. Yaari and A. Soudack
on Jan. 24, Mssrs. WTYL&S fool
that, we should clarify our posi
tion concerning Ihe Eichmann
case. In no way do we condonc
Eichmann for his actions. We con
demn his atrocities and fully
agree with Mr. Yaari and Mr.
Soudack that he should have been
apprehended and brought to trial.
However, we object to the way in
which Eichmann was captured
and question the legal right of
Israel to try him.
If Eichmann had been turned
over to Argentine authorities for
either trial or deportation, few
objections could be raised. How
ever. we do not believe that Is
rael, the United States or any
other nation has the right to send
a secret police force into a second
nation for the purpose of arrest
ing or kidnapping a citizen or
resident of that second nation un
less such a system of extraterri
toriality has been mutually agreed
upon. If restrictions upon extra
territoriality are not observed, no
one would be safe from the retri
butions of a foreign power which
he might have antagonized.
Furthermore, we question the
legal right of Israel to place Eich
mann on trial at all. Ho should
either be tried in Germany, the
country in which his crimes were
committed, or before an interna
tional tribunal. If Eichmann's
crimes were committed in Ger
many, against German citizens,
his atrocities are purely a German
domestic affair. In this case, Eich
mann should be tried in a German
court since Israel has no jurisdic
tion over Germany's internal af
fairs and since the present State
of Israel did not exist at the time
the crimes were committed.
However, if Eichmann executed
citizens of other countries as well
as Germans, he is guilty of com
mitting an international crime, a
"war crime," a "crime against
humanity." Such "war crimes"
have been considered by an inter
national court such as those at
Nuremburg and Tokyo and have
not been entrusted to any single
nation. We see no reason why the
Eichmann case should be an ex
ception to these precedents.
Finally, we question the fair
ness of an Israeli trial. If the
State of Israel has been willing to
overlook international law and
violate the territorial integrity of
Argentina in order to capture
Eichmann. what is to deter it from
performing another act of over
sight in order to convict him?
