! Editor, The Daily:
In answer 1o questions raised
by a recent news story in The
Daily, the members of the Stan
ford Chapter of the Delta Tau
Delta Fraternity wish to state
emphatically that this fraternity
does not engage in discrimina
tion, whether on the basis of race,
religion, or national origin, In its
membership procedures.
The stand of this house is sup
ported and justified by the na
tional constitution of the fratern
ity. This constitution contains no
provisions intended to lead to dis
crimination of any kind.
Until two years ago the consti
tution of the fraternity did con
tain restrictive clauses. The Stan
ford Chapter, which for many
years had ignored these clauses
by pledging and initiating both
non-whites and Jews, led an ac
tive fight against the discrimina
tory clause at the fraternity na
tional convention in 1959.
Subsequently the objectionable
restrictions were removed from
the fraternity constitution. It was
the present members of this house
who led the vigorous effort which

resulted in this successful conclu
sion.
We wish to go on record as sup
porting and encouraging chapters
of other fraternities whose na
tional constitutions contain dis
criminatory clauses.
Members of Stanford
Chapter Delta Tau Delta
Editor, The Daily:
A recent news story stated that
the Delta Tau Delta constitution
contained a discriminatory clause.
A letter received from the nation
al secretary this weekend states
that "Delta Tau Delta member
ship qualifications do not discrim
inate against any candidate for
membership on the grounds of
race, color, creed or national
origin."

We are pleased to he able to
correct the earlier misinterpre
tation of the clause.
