# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION
## 
### Ken Dery 
A 25-year-old Negro came down out of the far Northwest last
Saturday as the leading scorer in the nation. He left after a short
skirmish with the University of Sail Francisco Dons with the same
distinction.
Frank Burgess, a fi-1 senior guard for the Oonzaga Bulldogs of
Spokane. Wash., blew into town last weekend with a 32.3 points per
game average. He had just finished taking apart the Cal Aggies with
a 52-point burst two nights earlier and the rave notices seemed
infinite.
Coach Ilank Anderson had already rated him publicly as "the
best player to come out of the area since Elgin Baylor" and believes
he has enough ability to follow the ex-Seattle ace into the pro game.
Smooth Frank finished fifth nationally in scoring last year with
7r>l points good for a 2S.S average. Both of these were new Bulldog
records. His scoring was not against easy clubs, either. He hit for
30 against Bradley, 32 against Creighton and Manhattan, and in two
meetings with Seattle he hit for 2H and 36 points.
AS IF HIS BILLING of "The Lethal Scorer" and the journey
to the city of the cable cars were not enough the contest with the

defense-minded Dons was to be
carried on that often-times cruel
ico nod as t television.
There were many eyes glued to
many luminous tubes as Burgess
stood near the center circle almost
dreamily nonchalant as the ref
eree steeped in to start the pro
ceedings. What followed is hard
to describe but probably the best
example can be given by a situ
ation that took place with the
twelve self-appointed critics who
watched the game with me.
As the battle started there were
catcalls coming from every corner
of the room: Fire it up Burgess;
Hit it Gunner; You're on TV Bur
gess, belter start shooting (there
were other interesting comments
that wouldn't pass the censor
which have been omitted).
LET ME tell you— fire it up he
did. His first shot came after he

had circled the entire USF team and had shaken the number of de
fenders clinging to his number 43 down to two. It was a forced jump 1
shot that had the critics raising the roof in protest as it swished
cleanly through the net. Hard to believe how lucky anyone could
be was the quick consensus of opinion; an opinion that probably !
was heard back in Spokane.
Shot number two was another jump shot, this time from the deep i
right-hand corner. It almost tore the net down as it exploded through.
Still catcalls but a little less emphatic.
Shot number three occurred when Frank had a defender waving
a frantic hand in his face about 30 feet from the treasured goal. A|
quick flick sent a soft two-handed set shot high into the stratosphere. |
It went in as if directed by radar and there was no more disbelief—i
now everybody was calling for Burgess to shoot just to see what
new miracles he could perform.
The cool gliding backcourter hit them from every angle—behind
his head, hooking on the run, flips from behind a twisting shoulder.
It got to the point that if lie missed an occasional shot there was
something wrong with the basket or he had been fouled and the of
ficials had missed the glaring infraction.
Fantastic Frank went on to hit 14 field goals out of 22 attempts
for a staggering 63.6 per cent from the field. He threw in six flawless
charity tosses to end the festivities with 34 markers. His first half ex
hibition had been eight fielders in ten attempts, with only one "easy
one" in the total.
Meanwhile back at the ranch the Dons had eeked out the hard
fought contest by the slim margin of 64-62. You see Burgess doesn't
have much of a team to complement his individual heroics. In fact
Frank hardly ever saw a friendly screen and usually had to slid all
over ihe hardwood to make his own openings.
Whether the career of Frank Burgess goes on after this season
ends only time will tell. Although his defense looked adequate he
didn't throw any brilliant passes and lost the ball a couple of times
on a steal and a traveling violation.
Kut man-oli-man with that touch of velvet he could bring an ocean
of tears —to friendly forces as well as enemy.
The Incomparable Cousy
Tn another TV roundball bonanza those loyal to the pros as well
as to Ihe simon-pures were treated to a delightful bit of wizardry
Sunday morning featuring Boh Cousy & Company, a magician with
an eleven-man traveling act.
THIS SPECTACULAR was so exquisitely staged that straight-man
and sometimes coach Red Aurbach wasn't even called upon to add his
customary antics.
In case you have missed the drift the reference is to the Boston
Celtics who trounced arch-rival Philadelphia (of Wilt the Stilt fame)
by ihe score of 128 to 115. The score doesn't even begin to tell the
story for the fabulous Celts let down in the last period after flying
through the first three with a 35-point lead.
Cousy in the first period was blindingly brilliant as he proved to
all viewers why many have called him the best player in the history
of the sport.
lie scored 18 big points in the hectic first stanza and witli the aid
of Kill Russell had the Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain so bamboozled
lie looked like lie was watching a tennis match.
Cousy dug deep into his patented bag of tricks and came up with
the devastating variety of moves that have left the world's best
standing red-faced. He stole passes, ran the Celtics' legendary fast
break, scored from way out on looping one-handed sets, drove straight
up the middle, passed off as only he can and even threw in a hook i
from underneath.
But the one move that has filled Boston Garden to capacity so
many times the behind the back pass to himself and then the easy
layin after the defender has been completely faked out of position -
was the one you go away remembering. There is still time to see
Cooz for he never seems to show his age just ask the fans in Boston.
Oh No—Baker and Kasso
Another item that probably was overlooked by many last week
was a tiny little wire story that carried a byline from Corvallis, Ore.
In two or three short sentences it got across the point that staid,
soft-spoken Oregon State football coach Tom Prothro had made a
change in next year's strategy. After many successful seasons em
ploying the single wing formation as their main offensive pattern,
ihe Beavers will switch to the T. For those who did not see Stanford
battle the lightning-bolt charges of junior tailback Don Kasso and
ihe swan-like movements of sophomore tailback Terry Baker as
he swept either end you don't know what is coming when both boys
will be able to play at the same time. Jack Curtice knows.
All Star Game Fixing?
There was also another item that more than just whispered by
last week. Dick Young, a sports writer, came out with an expose
charging that the great offensive shows in Ihe All-Star football
games and in the Pro-Bowl game are fixed that way.
That the games are fixed is nonsense, but it is true (and Phila- j
delphia Eagles' ex-coach Buck Shaw admits it) that there is no red- !
dogging or blitzing in on the quarterback because "the offensive
team has had only a few workouts together."
The whole story has not been presented by the accused bill if Ibis
no 'red-dogging' policy is true —(his writer thinks it should be
changed. Those defensive backs have enough trouble already trying
to slop flie greal passing-receiving combinations.

Shot number two was another jump shot, this time from the deep i
right-hand corner. It almost tore the net down as it exploded through.
Still catcalls but a little less emphatic.
Shot number three occurred when Frank had a defender waving
a frantic hand in his face about 30 feet from the treasured goal. A|
quick flick sent a soft two-handed set shot high into the stratosphere. |
It went in as if directed by radar and there was no more disbelief—i
now everybody was calling for Burgess to shoot just to see what
new miracles he could perform.
The cool gliding backcourter hit them from every angle—behind
his head, hooking on the run, flips from behind a twisting shoulder.
It got to the point that if lie missed an occasional shot there was
something wrong with the basket or he had been fouled and the of
ficials had missed the glaring infraction.
Fantastic Frank went on to hit 14 field goals out of 22 attempts
for a staggering 63.6 per cent from the field. He threw in six flawless
charity tosses to end the festivities with 34 markers. His first half ex
hibition had been eight fielders in ten attempts, with only one "easy
one" in the total.
Meanwhile back at the ranch the Dons had eeked out the hard
fought contest by the slim margin of 64-62. You see Burgess doesn't
have much of a team to complement his individual heroics. In fact
Frank hardly ever saw a friendly screen and usually had to slid all
over ihe hardwood to make his own openings.
Whether the career of Frank Burgess goes on after this season
ends only time will tell. Although his defense looked adequate he
didn't throw any brilliant passes and lost the ball a couple of times
on a steal and a traveling violation.
Kut man-oli-man with that touch of velvet he could bring an ocean
of tears —to friendly forces as well as enemy.
The Incomparable Cousy
Tn another TV roundball bonanza those loyal to the pros as well
as to Ihe simon-pures were treated to a delightful bit of wizardry
Sunday morning featuring Boh Cousy & Company, a magician with
an eleven-man traveling act.
THIS SPECTACULAR was so exquisitely staged that straight-man
and sometimes coach Red Aurbach wasn't even called upon to add his
customary antics.
In case you have missed the drift the reference is to the Boston
Celtics who trounced arch-rival Philadelphia (of Wilt the Stilt fame)
by ihe score of 128 to 115. The score doesn't even begin to tell the
story for the fabulous Celts let down in the last period after flying
through the first three with a 35-point lead.
Cousy in the first period was blindingly brilliant as he proved to
all viewers why many have called him the best player in the history
of the sport.
lie scored 18 big points in the hectic first stanza and witli the aid
of Kill Russell had the Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain so bamboozled
lie looked like lie was watching a tennis match.
Cousy dug deep into his patented bag of tricks and came up with
the devastating variety of moves that have left the world's best
standing red-faced. He stole passes, ran the Celtics' legendary fast
break, scored from way out on looping one-handed sets, drove straight
up the middle, passed off as only he can and even threw in a hook i
from underneath.
But the one move that has filled Boston Garden to capacity so
many times the behind the back pass to himself and then the easy
layin after the defender has been completely faked out of position -
was the one you go away remembering. There is still time to see
Cooz for he never seems to show his age just ask the fans in Boston.
Oh No—Baker and Kasso
Another item that probably was overlooked by many last week
was a tiny little wire story that carried a byline from Corvallis, Ore.
In two or three short sentences it got across the point that staid,
soft-spoken Oregon State football coach Tom Prothro had made a
change in next year's strategy. After many successful seasons em
ploying the single wing formation as their main offensive pattern,
ihe Beavers will switch to the T. For those who did not see Stanford
battle the lightning-bolt charges of junior tailback Don Kasso and
ihe swan-like movements of sophomore tailback Terry Baker as
he swept either end you don't know what is coming when both boys
will be able to play at the same time. Jack Curtice knows.
All Star Game Fixing?
There was also another item that more than just whispered by
last week. Dick Young, a sports writer, came out with an expose
charging that the great offensive shows in Ihe All-Star football
games and in the Pro-Bowl game are fixed that way.
That the games are fixed is nonsense, but it is true (and Phila- j
delphia Eagles' ex-coach Buck Shaw admits it) that there is no red- !
dogging or blitzing in on the quarterback because "the offensive
team has had only a few workouts together."
The whole story has not been presented by the accused bill if Ibis
no 'red-dogging' policy is true —(his writer thinks it should be
changed. Those defensive backs have enough trouble already trying
to slop flie greal passing-receiving combinations.


FRANK BURGESS
A Touch of Velvet
A 25-year-old Negro came down out of the far Northwest last
Saturday as the leading scorer in the nation. He left after a short
skirmish with the University of Sail Francisco Dons with the same
distinction.
Frank Burgess, a fi-1 senior guard for the Oonzaga Bulldogs of
Spokane. Wash., blew into town last weekend with a 32.3 points per
game average. He had just finished taking apart the Cal Aggies with
a 52-point burst two nights earlier and the rave notices seemed
infinite.
Coach Ilank Anderson had already rated him publicly as "the
best player to come out of the area since Elgin Baylor" and believes
he has enough ability to follow the ex-Seattle ace into the pro game.
Smooth Frank finished fifth nationally in scoring last year with
7r>l points good for a 2S.S average. Both of these were new Bulldog
records. His scoring was not against easy clubs, either. He hit for
30 against Bradley, 32 against Creighton and Manhattan, and in two
meetings with Seattle he hit for 2H and 36 points.
AS IF HIS BILLING of "The Lethal Scorer" and the journey
to the city of the cable cars were not enough the contest with the

defense-minded Dons was to be
carried on that often-times cruel
ico nod as t television.
There were many eyes glued to
many luminous tubes as Burgess
stood near the center circle almost
dreamily nonchalant as the ref
eree steeped in to start the pro
ceedings. What followed is hard
to describe but probably the best
example can be given by a situ
ation that took place with the
twelve self-appointed critics who
watched the game with me.
As the battle started there were
catcalls coming from every corner
of the room: Fire it up Burgess;
Hit it Gunner; You're on TV Bur
gess, belter start shooting (there
were other interesting comments
that wouldn't pass the censor
which have been omitted).
LET ME tell you— fire it up he
did. His first shot came after he

had circled the entire USF team and had shaken the number of de
fenders clinging to his number 43 down to two. It was a forced jump 1
shot that had the critics raising the roof in protest as it swished
cleanly through the net. Hard to believe how lucky anyone could
be was the quick consensus of opinion; an opinion that probably !
was heard back in Spokane.
Shot number two was another jump shot, this time from the deep i
right-hand corner. It almost tore the net down as it exploded through.

by ihe score of 128 to 115. The score doesn't even begin to tell the
story for the fabulous Celts let down in the last period after flying
through the first three with a 35-point lead.
Cousy in the first period was blindingly brilliant as he proved to
all viewers why many have called him the best player in the history
of the sport.
lie scored 18 big points in the hectic first stanza and witli the aid
of Kill Russell had the Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain so bamboozled
lie looked like lie was watching a tennis match.
Cousy dug deep into his patented bag of tricks and came up with
the devastating variety of moves that have left the world's best
standing red-faced. He stole passes, ran the Celtics' legendary fast
break, scored from way out on looping one-handed sets, drove straight
up the middle, passed off as only he can and even threw in a hook i
from underneath.
But the one move that has filled Boston Garden to capacity so
many times the behind the back pass to himself and then the easy
layin after the defender has been completely faked out of position -
was the one you go away remembering. There is still time to see
Cooz for he never seems to show his age just ask the fans in Boston.
Oh No—Baker and Kasso
Another item that probably was overlooked by many last week
was a tiny little wire story that carried a byline from Corvallis, Ore.
In two or three short sentences it got across the point that staid,
soft-spoken Oregon State football coach Tom Prothro had made a
change in next year's strategy. After many successful seasons em
ploying the single wing formation as their main offensive pattern,
ihe Beavers will switch to the T. For those who did not see Stanford
battle the lightning-bolt charges of junior tailback Don Kasso and
ihe swan-like movements of sophomore tailback Terry Baker as
he swept either end you don't know what is coming when both boys
will be able to play at the same time. Jack Curtice knows.
All Star Game Fixing?
There was also another item that more than just whispered by
last week. Dick Young, a sports writer, came out with an expose
charging that the great offensive shows in Ihe All-Star football
games and in the Pro-Bowl game are fixed that way.
That the games are fixed is nonsense, but it is true (and Phila- j
delphia Eagles' ex-coach Buck Shaw admits it) that there is no red- !
dogging or blitzing in on the quarterback because "the offensive
team has had only a few workouts together."
The whole story has not been presented by the accused bill if Ibis
no 'red-dogging' policy is true —(his writer thinks it should be
changed. Those defensive backs have enough trouble already trying
to slop flie greal passing-receiving combinations.


FRANK BURGESS
A Touch of Velvet
A 25-year-old Negro came down out of the far Northwest last
Saturday as the leading scorer in the nation. He left after a short
skirmish with the University of Sail Francisco Dons with the same
distinction.
Frank Burgess, a fi-1 senior guard for the Oonzaga Bulldogs of
Spokane. Wash., blew into town last weekend with a 32.3 points per
game average. He had just finished taking apart the Cal Aggies with
a 52-point burst two nights earlier and the rave notices seemed
infinite.
Coach Ilank Anderson had already rated him publicly as "the
best player to come out of the area since Elgin Baylor" and believes
he has enough ability to follow the ex-Seattle ace into the pro game.
Smooth Frank finished fifth nationally in scoring last year with
7r>l points good for a 2S.S average. Both of these were new Bulldog
records. His scoring was not against easy clubs, either. He hit for
30 against Bradley, 32 against Creighton and Manhattan, and in two
meetings with Seattle he hit for 2H and 36 points.
AS IF HIS BILLING of "The Lethal Scorer" and the journey
to the city of the cable cars were not enough the contest with the

defense-minded Dons was to be
carried on that often-times cruel
ico nod as t television.
There were many eyes glued to
many luminous tubes as Burgess
stood near the center circle almost
dreamily nonchalant as the ref
eree steeped in to start the pro
ceedings. What followed is hard
to describe but probably the best
example can be given by a situ
ation that took place with the
twelve self-appointed critics who
watched the game with me.
As the battle started there were
catcalls coming from every corner
of the room: Fire it up Burgess;
Hit it Gunner; You're on TV Bur
gess, belter start shooting (there
were other interesting comments
that wouldn't pass the censor
which have been omitted).
LET ME tell you— fire it up he
did. His first shot came after he

had circled the entire USF team and had shaken the number of de
fenders clinging to his number 43 down to two. It was a forced jump 1
shot that had the critics raising the roof in protest as it swished
cleanly through the net. Hard to believe how lucky anyone could
be was the quick consensus of opinion; an opinion that probably !
was heard back in Spokane.
Shot number two was another jump shot, this time from the deep i
right-hand corner. It almost tore the net down as it exploded through.
Still catcalls but a little less emphatic.
Shot number three occurred when Frank had a defender waving
a frantic hand in his face about 30 feet from the treasured goal. A|
quick flick sent a soft two-handed set shot high into the stratosphere. |
It went in as if directed by radar and there was no more disbelief—i
now everybody was calling for Burgess to shoot just to see what
new miracles he could perform.
The cool gliding backcourter hit them from every angle—behind
his head, hooking on the run, flips from behind a twisting shoulder.
It got to the point that if lie missed an occasional shot there was
something wrong with the basket or he had been fouled and the of
ficials had missed the glaring infraction.
Fantastic Frank went on to hit 14 field goals out of 22 attempts
for a staggering 63.6 per cent from the field. He threw in six flawless
charity tosses to end the festivities with 34 markers. His first half ex
hibition had been eight fielders in ten attempts, with only one "easy
one" in the total.
Meanwhile back at the ranch the Dons had eeked out the hard
fought contest by the slim margin of 64-62. You see Burgess doesn't
have much of a team to complement his individual heroics. In fact
Frank hardly ever saw a friendly screen and usually had to slid all
over ihe hardwood to make his own openings.
Whether the career of Frank Burgess goes on after this season
ends only time will tell. Although his defense looked adequate he
didn't throw any brilliant passes and lost the ball a couple of times
on a steal and a traveling violation.
Kut man-oli-man with that touch of velvet he could bring an ocean
of tears —to friendly forces as well as enemy.
The Incomparable Cousy
Tn another TV roundball bonanza those loyal to the pros as well
as to Ihe simon-pures were treated to a delightful bit of wizardry
Sunday morning featuring Boh Cousy & Company, a magician with
an eleven-man traveling act.
THIS SPECTACULAR was so exquisitely staged that straight-man
and sometimes coach Red Aurbach wasn't even called upon to add his
customary antics.

FRANK BURGESS
A Touch of Velvet
A 25-year-old Negro came down out of the far Northwest last
Saturday as the leading scorer in the nation. He left after a short
skirmish with the University of Sail Francisco Dons with the same
distinction.
Frank Burgess, a fi-1 senior guard for the Oonzaga Bulldogs of
Spokane. Wash., blew into town last weekend with a 32.3 points per
game average. He had just finished taking apart the Cal Aggies with
a 52-point burst two nights earlier and the rave notices seemed
infinite.
Coach Ilank Anderson had already rated him publicly as "the
best player to come out of the area since Elgin Baylor" and believes
he has enough ability to follow the ex-Seattle ace into the pro game.
Smooth Frank finished fifth nationally in scoring last year with
7r>l points good for a 2S.S average. Both of these were new Bulldog
records. His scoring was not against easy clubs, either. He hit for
30 against Bradley, 32 against Creighton and Manhattan, and in two
meetings with Seattle he hit for 2H and 36 points.
AS IF HIS BILLING of "The Lethal Scorer" and the journey
to the city of the cable cars were not enough the contest with the

defense-minded Dons was to be
carried on that often-times cruel
ico nod as t television.
There were many eyes glued to
many luminous tubes as Burgess
stood near the center circle almost
dreamily nonchalant as the ref
eree steeped in to start the pro
ceedings. What followed is hard
to describe but probably the best
example can be given by a situ
ation that took place with the
twelve self-appointed critics who
watched the game with me.
As the battle started there were
catcalls coming from every corner
of the room: Fire it up Burgess;
Hit it Gunner; You're on TV Bur
gess, belter start shooting (there
were other interesting comments
that wouldn't pass the censor
which have been omitted).
LET ME tell you— fire it up he
did. His first shot came after he

had circled the entire USF team and had shaken the number of de
fenders clinging to his number 43 down to two. It was a forced jump 1
shot that had the critics raising the roof in protest as it swished
cleanly through the net. Hard to believe how lucky anyone could
be was the quick consensus of opinion; an opinion that probably !
was heard back in Spokane.
Shot number two was another jump shot, this time from the deep i
right-hand corner. It almost tore the net down as it exploded through.
Still catcalls but a little less emphatic.
Shot number three occurred when Frank had a defender waving
a frantic hand in his face about 30 feet from the treasured goal. A|
quick flick sent a soft two-handed set shot high into the stratosphere. |
It went in as if directed by radar and there was no more disbelief—i
now everybody was calling for Burgess to shoot just to see what
new miracles he could perform.
The cool gliding backcourter hit them from every angle—behind
his head, hooking on the run, flips from behind a twisting shoulder.
It got to the point that if lie missed an occasional shot there was
something wrong with the basket or he had been fouled and the of
ficials had missed the glaring infraction.
Fantastic Frank went on to hit 14 field goals out of 22 attempts
for a staggering 63.6 per cent from the field. He threw in six flawless
charity tosses to end the festivities with 34 markers. His first half ex
hibition had been eight fielders in ten attempts, with only one "easy
one" in the total.
Meanwhile back at the ranch the Dons had eeked out the hard
fought contest by the slim margin of 64-62. You see Burgess doesn't
have much of a team to complement his individual heroics. In fact
Frank hardly ever saw a friendly screen and usually had to slid all
over ihe hardwood to make his own openings.
Whether the career of Frank Burgess goes on after this season
ends only time will tell. Although his defense looked adequate he
didn't throw any brilliant passes and lost the ball a couple of times
on a steal and a traveling violation.
Kut man-oli-man with that touch of velvet he could bring an ocean
of tears —to friendly forces as well as enemy.
The Incomparable Cousy
Tn another TV roundball bonanza those loyal to the pros as well
as to Ihe simon-pures were treated to a delightful bit of wizardry
Sunday morning featuring Boh Cousy & Company, a magician with
an eleven-man traveling act.
THIS SPECTACULAR was so exquisitely staged that straight-man
and sometimes coach Red Aurbach wasn't even called upon to add his
customary antics.
In case you have missed the drift the reference is to the Boston
Celtics who trounced arch-rival Philadelphia (of Wilt the Stilt fame)
by ihe score of 128 to 115. The score doesn't even begin to tell the
story for the fabulous Celts let down in the last period after flying
through the first three with a 35-point lead.
Cousy in the first period was blindingly brilliant as he proved to
all viewers why many have called him the best player in the history
of the sport.
lie scored 18 big points in the hectic first stanza and witli the aid
of Kill Russell had the Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain so bamboozled
lie looked like lie was watching a tennis match.
Cousy dug deep into his patented bag of tricks and came up with
the devastating variety of moves that have left the world's best
standing red-faced. He stole passes, ran the Celtics' legendary fast
break, scored from way out on looping one-handed sets, drove straight
up the middle, passed off as only he can and even threw in a hook i
from underneath.
But the one move that has filled Boston Garden to capacity so
many times the behind the back pass to himself and then the easy
layin after the defender has been completely faked out of position -
was the one you go away remembering. There is still time to see
Cooz for he never seems to show his age just ask the fans in Boston.
Oh No—Baker and Kasso
Another item that probably was overlooked by many last week
was a tiny little wire story that carried a byline from Corvallis, Ore.
In two or three short sentences it got across the point that staid,
soft-spoken Oregon State football coach Tom Prothro had made a
change in next year's strategy. After many successful seasons em
ploying the single wing formation as their main offensive pattern,
ihe Beavers will switch to the T. For those who did not see Stanford
battle the lightning-bolt charges of junior tailback Don Kasso and
ihe swan-like movements of sophomore tailback Terry Baker as
he swept either end you don't know what is coming when both boys
will be able to play at the same time. Jack Curtice knows.
All Star Game Fixing?
There was also another item that more than just whispered by
last week. Dick Young, a sports writer, came out with an expose
charging that the great offensive shows in Ihe All-Star football
games and in the Pro-Bowl game are fixed that way.
That the games are fixed is nonsense, but it is true (and Phila- j
delphia Eagles' ex-coach Buck Shaw admits it) that there is no red- !
dogging or blitzing in on the quarterback because "the offensive
team has had only a few workouts together."
