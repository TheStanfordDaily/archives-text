## Wrestlers Host Moffett Field Daily Sports 
### BILL BLACK 
The Stanford wrestling team
plays host tonight to Moffett
Field at 7:30 in the Encina Gym.
Coach McKenna says that the

team is somewhat of an unknown
quality but he feels lhat Stan
ford should win the meet.
MOFFETT FIELDS best wres
tler is James Nelson. He will be
wrestling in the 137 lb. division
and will face Art Snoke of Stan
ford.
Another outstanding wrestler
from Moffett Field is Rip Rohrer.
He will bo in the 167 lb. division
and will meel either Frank Redle
or Scott Romney. Redle usually
wrestles in this division and is

i undefeated for the season but]
may be put out of action for the 1
match by a back injury.
j The rest of Stanford's lineup
I will probably remain unchanged
I from the last home meet, al
i though there is a possibility that
j Pete Barnhisel will replace Phil
Murphy in the 157 lb. class.
DUNCAN KOSS will be out
weighed by almost twenty pounds
I in the heavyweight division but!
proved that he can handle out-1
i sized opponents last Thursday
against Cal Poly when he pinned i
his opponent in the first period,
although outweighed by a similar
margin.
McKenna also announced that
a meet has .just been scheduled
with UCLA for February 23.
In other wrestling action over
the weekend the Stanford JV
frosh team lost a close 10-14 de
cision to Cabrillo College. How
ever. several Card wrestlers won
their matches and showed prom

ise of developing into good var
sity material.
SCOTT ROMNEY pinned his
opponent in the 117 class and may
get his chance at varsity compe
tition tomorrow night if Redle is
unable to wrestle.
In the 167 lb. class .Ton Kay won
a close 12-10 decision in what Me-
Kenna describes as one of the
best matches of ihe year. Don
Beuhler won a 7-3 decision in the
191 lb. division.
In Ihe heavyweight division
Marshall Howard of Stanford won
a 7-0 decision from last year's j
Northern California high school |
champion. Howard almost pinner!
his opponent in the closing sec
onds of the match. If he had been
able to get the pin before time
ran out the meet would have
ended in a tie, since five points
are given for a pin and only three
for a win by decision in comput
ing Hie team score.

MOFFETT FIELDS best wres
tler is James Nelson. He will be
wrestling in the 137 lb. division
and will face Art Snoke of Stan
ford.
Another outstanding wrestler
from Moffett Field is Rip Rohrer.

and will meel either Frank Redle
or Scott Romney. Redle usually
wrestles in this division and is

i undefeated for the season but]
may be put out of action for the 1
match by a back injury.

i though there is a possibility that
j Pete Barnhisel will replace Phil
Murphy in the 157 lb. class.
DUNCAN KOSS will be out
weighed by almost twenty pounds
I in the heavyweight division but!
proved that he can handle out-1
