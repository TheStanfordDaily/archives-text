# Cuba Tries Americans For 'Crimes' Against State
## 
### 
HAVANA (UPI) — A military court trying six Americans on
charges of crimes against the Cuban state yesterday was expected
to return its verdict at any moment.
Government sources said the sentences would be handed down
bv the five-man army court before the day was over. The six could

be sentenced to a firing squad
death if convicted, but it was
widely believed that although the
Americans would be found guilty
the court would limit itself to pri
son terms or possibly deportation.
WAITING in cells at La Ca
bana Fortress for the verdict were
Donald J. Green, 28, of Gastonia,
N.C.; Leonard L. Schmidt, 21, of
Chicago; George R. Beck, 24, of
Norton. Mass.; Tommy L. Baker,
28. of Dot ban, Ala.; James R.
Bean, 34, of Cedar Falls, N.C., and
Alfred E. Gibson, 32, of Durham,
N.C.
The Americans stood trial for
three hours last Saturday at the
Cabana courtroom across the bay
from Havana. Court-appointed de
fense attorney appealed for their
acquittal, or deportation. Army
prosecutors demanding the death
penalty, however, accused them
of being "bloodthirsty" U.S. mili
tary service veterans in the em
ploy of "counter-revolutionaries."
The men were accused of sail
ing to Cuba aboard a Florida
based yacht with arms to join
rebel guerrilla bands in Western
Cuba. However, the Americans
told the court they were en route
to South America when they were
blown off-course in a storm and
forced into Havana harbor.
SWISS embassy officials who
have been handling American af
fairs in Cuba since the Washing
ton break in relations, said Sun
day the prisoners "seemed well
although so m o w h a t apprehen
sive." The Fidel Castro regime
late last year executed three
American soldiers-of-fortune ac
cused similarly of crimes against
the state.
The government press mean
while disclosed that another 10
Cubans, including two women,
had been sentenced to stiff prison
terms for counter-revolutionary
activities. Army courts handed
down sentences ranging from nine
to 20 years imprisonment.
The convictions brought to
more than 60 the number of per
sons tried for anti-Castro acts in
the past few weeks. At least 10
persons have been executed as
enemies of the state this year.

acquittal, or deportation. Army
prosecutors demanding the death

The men were accused of sail

rebel guerrilla bands in Western
Cuba. However, the Americans
told the court they were en route
to South America when they were
blown off-course in a storm and
forced into Havana harbor.

American soldiers-of-fortune ac

the state.
The government press mean
while disclosed that another 10
Cubans, including two women,
had been sentenced to stiff prison
terms for counter-revolutionary
activities. Army courts handed
down sentences ranging from nine
to 20 years imprisonment.
The convictions brought to
more than 60 the number of per
sons tried for anti-Castro acts in
the past few weeks. At least 10
persons have been executed as
enemies of the state this year.
HAVANA (UPI) — A military court trying six Americans on
charges of crimes against the Cuban state yesterday was expected
to return its verdict at any moment.
Government sources said the sentences would be handed down
bv the five-man army court before the day was over. The six could

be sentenced to a firing squad
death if convicted, but it was
widely believed that although the
Americans would be found guilty
the court would limit itself to pri
son terms or possibly deportation.
WAITING in cells at La Ca
bana Fortress for the verdict were
Donald J. Green, 28, of Gastonia,
N.C.; Leonard L. Schmidt, 21, of
Chicago; George R. Beck, 24, of
Norton. Mass.; Tommy L. Baker,
28. of Dot ban, Ala.; James R.
Bean, 34, of Cedar Falls, N.C., and
