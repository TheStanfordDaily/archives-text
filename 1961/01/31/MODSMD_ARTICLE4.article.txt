# Police Plan Crackdown on Reckless Bikes
## 
### 
Stanford policemen "may
have to start giving tickets to
bicyclists who ride at night
without lights and who bar
rel through stop-signs," ac
cording to Police Chief Gor
don Davis. He commented
further that a $5 fine accom
panies a ticket for disregard
ing stop-signs.
For the students' safety,
Chief Davis urges bicyclists
to apply fluorescent strips to
their bicycles and to install
headlights, which are being
sold at the bookstore. Any
student who operates his bi
cycle without a headlight
breaks tho law just as if he
ran a stop-sign.
