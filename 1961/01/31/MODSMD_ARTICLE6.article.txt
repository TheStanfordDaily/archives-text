LISBON (UPD — Diplomats said
yesterday a serious diplomatic
crisis will result if Brazil's incom
ing president gives asylum to
the rebels who hijacked the Por
tugliest liner Santa Maria.
The Portuguese government
received with relief yesterday a
formal promise by the outgoing
Brazilian administration to intern
rebel commander Henrique Gal
vao and his band and restore the
hijacked liner to Portugal if they
pul into a Brazilian port.
BUT OFFICIALS waited ner
vously to see whether today's
presidential changeover in Brazil
which will bring President-elect
Janio Quadros to power will also
result in an about-face in Brazil's
policy toward the shipboard rebels.
A Brazilian newspaper report
Sunday quoted Quadros as saying
that Galvao is an "old friend" and
will be given political asylum af
ter today's presidential inaugura
tion.
Later dispatches reporting that
Quadros had refused to confirm
this report caused Portuguese of
ficials to express obvious relief.
The feeling here was that Sun
day night's note expressed Bra
zil's official policy and that a sud
den post - inauguration switch
would be almost unbelievable.
BUT GALVAO apparently has
secured the help of Carlos La
cerda, governor of the Brazilian
state of Guanabara and Quadros'
right-hand man. •
In response to an appeal from
Galvao, Lacerda sent him the fol
lowing message:
"President Janio (Quadros) de
clared to the press that he would
assure the disembarkation of pas
sengers . . . and that the ship
would remain in your power . . .
although these declarations to the
press have not been confirmed of
ficially, I can tell you that they
really represent the thinking of
the new president."
While diplomatic speculation
continued Rear Adm. Allen E.
Smith, commander of the Carib
bean Sea Frontier, was aboard the
destroyer Gearing,. steaming to
ward the Santa Maria, as two
other U.S. navy destroyers and
the Brazilian corvette Ypiranga
circled the big liner, some 40 miles
northeast of Recife.
