"'Waltz'," said Dr. Loper. di
rector, "is one of Anouilh's more
popular plays in this country.
One of its more unusual qualities
is thai it manages to get a farce

forward, improbable level, using
improbable events to show the
serious problems of loneliness
and compromise in Ihc day-to-day
life of General St. Pe."

the same name, and as the same
type of figure in Anouilh's more
serious play, "Ardele" ("Cry of
the Peacock"). In "Waltz" he is
a romantic character whose one
memorable experience is falling
in love with a woman at a ball.
Richard Risso, a graduate stu
dent in the drama department
with several years acting experi
ence, plays the General. His wife
is played by Lisa Lauterer. whose
theatrical experience includes di
recting the first opera ever pre

sets, and Paul Landry, the light

design was-manufacturing a win

were designed by Irene Griffin.
