RECIFE, Brazil (UPI) - Rebel
Capt Henrique Galvao promised
yesterday in a radio message to
sail the hijacked Portuguese liner
Santa Maria into Recife today but
Brazil maintained silence last
night and tire 620 captive passen
gers were reported "very nervous
and apprehensive."
U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Allen
Smith, Jr., boarded the liner for
three hours yesterday and talked
with Galvao. He said Galvao still
hoped to land in Recife today but
was filled with uncertainty be
cause he did not know what type
of welcome he would receive.
"Wtt TAI.KIOD with quite a few
passengers aboard the Santa
Maria and they were very nervous
and apprehensive, living on hopes
and promises," Smith told a news
conference last night aboard the
destroyer U.S.S. Gearing, one of
three circling the liner at ;i dis
tance oi a quarter of a mile.

Smith told Dennison the morale
of the passengers was only "fair."
He said they showed no indica
tion of distress but that all ex
pressed the strongest disappoint
ment because Galvao told them
time and again they would soon
be freed.
"However, the passengers be
lieve Galvao has not kept his
word," Dennison said.
Till; NAVY apparently was rul
ing out the possibility of transfer
ring the passengers to other ves
sels at sea unless this became a
necessity. Smith said the sea con
ditions themselves were favor
able fairly good weather but
lhat ground swells would make
the operation perilous.
Dennison was asked what the
Navy would do if the Santa Maria
refused to enter port and put back
to sea.
"That question cannot *be an
swered until or unless he makes
such a move," he said.
