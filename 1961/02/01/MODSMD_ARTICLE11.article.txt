# Grad School Tourney Draws Yo-Yo Fanatics
## 
### MARCIA LOER 
Another athletic first was added to Stanford's athletic history
last night with the advent of the first annual Crother's Memorial
Yo-Yo Tournament.
A capacity crowd of 50 watched four of the school's top contenders
in a gruelling marathon of skill and endurance.
The four contestants, Mike Swlontek. Tom Humphrey, Steu Steckel

and Ray Schenk, who are candi
dates in their spare time for
Master's and Doctor's degrees,
vied with each other for points in
difficult feats of skill.
The event opened with such
standard tricks as walk the dog,
over the falls and loop-the-loop
and climaxed with individual ex
hibitions of co-ordination and
dexerity.
First prize of a yo-yo string
went to Tom Humphrey for a
triple around-the-world which
ning were a duo doing a combi
wound up in his shirt pocket.
Other major events of the eve
nation of stunts in unison and
tricks executed while doing the
Cha-Cha-Cha and Charleston.
The evening which was inspired
by childhood reminiscences culmi
nated several weeks of intense
preparation.
The Crother's Mem youngsters
challenged any undergraduate
comers willing to face them.
