# Rayburn Rules Committee Plan Approved by Five Vote Margin
## Three Members Added to Body 
### 
WASHINGTON, (UPI) — The
I House handed President Kennedy
his first big congressional victory
yesterday by smashing a conserv
j ative Rules Committee roadblock
! that could have blocked action on
| key parts of his legislative pro
gram.
I
By a slim five-vote margin, the
tense House approved 217-212 a
proposal by Speaker Sam Ray
i burn, D-Tex., to liberalize Iho
j powerful committee by increasing
! its membership from 12 to 15. The
action meant that Rayburn should
| now control the group 8 to 7.
THE VOTE was a triumph for
Kennedy who was said to feel that:
his international prestige as well
as his program was at stake.
Aides said he believed his ability
to deal with Russia would have
been impaired by a defeat in Con
j gress now.
The outcome also preserved the
prestige of Rayburn, who threw
his full strength into the battle
against Rep. Howard W. Smith,
D-Va.. chairman of the Rules Com
mittee and a wily old political pro.
Smith headed a southern Demo
j cratic-Republican coalition which
j in the past has pigeonholed wel
i fare bills similar to those Kennedy
! will submit.
ON THE SHOWDOWN vote be
fore packed galleries, 22 Republi
cans broke with their party lead
ers to join 195 Democrats in sup
port of the Rayburn plan. Sixty
-1 four Democrats, all from southern
j and border states, defied Rayburn
and joined 148 Republicans in op
posing it.
While the Kennedy-Ray burn
forces carried the day, their nar
row victory margin may signal a
tough road ahead on the House
floor for administration bills
dealing with such issues as aid to
education, minimum wage and
medical care for the aged.
Rayburn now will name two ad
ditional Democrats to the com
mittee. One is expected to be a
western liberal and the other a
moderate Southerner. The third
| additional member will be a Re
publican chosen by the conserva
■ tive GOP leadership.
I THIS SHOULD mean the end
of the power of the coalition of
two Republicans and four Demo
crats which has forced 6-6 com
mittee deadlocks on previous wel
fare bills.
} Rayburn said the issue was
! simple, whether the House was to
be assured a chance to consider
the Kennedy legislative program,
or whether it was going to be
bottled up in the Rules Commit
tee. He also replied tartly to
i Smith's charge that he planned to
"pack" or "stack" the committee.
Smith, fighting to the last,
pledged before the vote that he
would not try to bai 4 floor votes
on five bills which Kennedy had
placed on his immediate priority
i list education, housing, mini
mum wage, aid to depressed areas
and medical care.

By a slim five-vote margin, the
tense House approved 217-212 a
proposal by Speaker Sam Ray
i burn, D-Tex., to liberalize Iho
j powerful committee by increasing
! its membership from 12 to 15. The
action meant that Rayburn should
| now control the group 8 to 7.
THE VOTE was a triumph for
Kennedy who was said to feel that:
his international prestige as well
as his program was at stake.
Aides said he believed his ability
to deal with Russia would have
been impaired by a defeat in Con
j gress now.
The outcome also preserved the
prestige of Rayburn, who threw
his full strength into the battle
against Rep. Howard W. Smith,
D-Va.. chairman of the Rules Com
mittee and a wily old political pro.
Smith headed a southern Demo
j cratic-Republican coalition which
j in the past has pigeonholed wel
i fare bills similar to those Kennedy
! will submit.

fore packed galleries, 22 Republi
cans broke with their party lead
ers to join 195 Democrats in sup
port of the Rayburn plan. Sixty

and joined 148 Republicans in op
posing it.
While the Kennedy-Ray burn
forces carried the day, their nar
row victory margin may signal a
tough road ahead on the House
floor for administration bills
dealing with such issues as aid to
education, minimum wage and
medical care for the aged.
Rayburn now will name two ad
ditional Democrats to the com
mittee. One is expected to be a
western liberal and the other a
moderate Southerner. The third

publican chosen by the conserva

I THIS SHOULD mean the end
of the power of the coalition of
two Republicans and four Demo
crats which has forced 6-6 com
mittee deadlocks on previous wel
fare bills.
} Rayburn said the issue was
! simple, whether the House was to
be assured a chance to consider
the Kennedy legislative program,
or whether it was going to be
bottled up in the Rules Commit
tee. He also replied tartly to
i Smith's charge that he planned to
"pack" or "stack" the committee.
Smith, fighting to the last,
pledged before the vote that he
would not try to bai 4 floor votes
on five bills which Kennedy had
placed on his immediate priority
