(Editor's Note: This is the sixth
in a series ol eight articles on the
Hoover Institution on War, Revo
lution, and Peace. Today's article
is about the Japanese Collection.)

Tvvo months after Japan signed
the unconditional surrender agree
ment abroad the U.S.S. Missouri
in Tokyo Bay in September, 194."),
the Tokyo Office of the Hoover
Institution was established under
the informal supervision of the
late Professor Hubert G. Schenck,
who was then chief of the Natural
Resources Section, Supremo Com
mander for the Allied Powers in
Japan.
In November, 1947, the Hoover
Library Advisory Committee, con
sisting of Col. Schenck and sev
eral Stanford people, was created
to advise and assist the work of
the Tokyo Office. Beside the mem
bers of the Advisory Committee, a
number of individuals, including
Professors Thomas C. Smith and
Harold H. Fisher, provided guid
ance with respect to the acquisi
tions program, which was to col
lect materials pertaining to Jap
anese political, economic, social
and cultural conditions dating
from the late Tokugawa period
(1840) and other Far Eastern af
fairs, particularly on China and
Manchuria.
Throughout this period, many
staff members of Allied Head
quarters assisted the Tokyo Of
fice and contributed important
documents concerning occupation
policy toward Japan. Also the
Tokyo Office established three
agencies throughout Japan in
order to secure valuable materials
of a fugitive nature.
The Japanese Collection com
prises some 40,000 books, 1,400
periodical titles (about 140 cur
rent) and 300 newspaper titles
(about 20 current) all in Japa
nese. Western language holdings
on Japan in the Hoover Institu
tion, including Russian, number
over 4,000 volumes. In addition to
its Japanese language materials,
the Japanese Collection also holds
some contemporary Korean lan
guage works.
Among major problems docu
mented in the Hoover Institution's
collection on Japan is that relat

ing 1o the broad question of mod
ernization, including its economic
and political aspects. Since Japan
was able to modernize early in
its modern history, in contrast to
other Asian countries which were
unsuccessful in this endeavor
until recently, American scholars
have in recent years become par
ticularly interested in the story
of Japan's success.
Within the Japanese Collection
there are several special collec
tions which are of interest. Among
these are photo-copies of Japanese
archival materials on Korea, com
prising some 500 folders of docu
ments originating in the Japanese
Legation in Seoul (.1894-1905), and
the Japanese Residency-General
in Korea (1906-1910),
These documents are useful for
the study of the history of .Japa
nese penetration into Korea, Since
the original documents, which
were stored in the Japanese Gov
ernment-General's Office in Seoul,
were burned at the end of the
war, only two copies remain—
those in the Hoover Institution
and those in Seoul. The latter
were partially destroyed during
the Korean War.
Another special collection con
sists of documents relating to
General Araki, who was a leading
member of the pre-war military
clique and who was tried as a
Class A war criminal by the In
ternational Military Tribunal for
the Far East. These documents,
which consist of his diary, person
al letters addressed to him, and
secret documents of the Japanese
Imperial General Staff, tell the
history of the rise of Japanese
militarism.
Since many Japanese scholars
circles visiter the Hoover Insti
tution in recent years, Japanese
and leading figures of various
journalism, TV and radio stations
have given wide publicity to its
activities. Thus, the Hoover In
stitution can easily acquire many
valuable and restricted materials
through gift and exchange pro
grams with various Japanese in
stitutions and government agen
cies.
In the Hoover Institution all
these resources are utilized for
the study of current Japanese
problems and their historical
background.

the Tokyo Office of the Hoover

In November, 1947, the Hoover
Library Advisory Committee, con

to advise and assist the work of
the Tokyo Office. Beside the mem
bers of the Advisory Committee, a
number of individuals, including
Professors Thomas C. Smith and
Harold H. Fisher, provided guid

lect materials pertaining to Jap
anese political, economic, social
and cultural conditions dating
from the late Tokugawa period
(1840) and other Far Eastern af
fairs, particularly on China and
Manchuria.
Throughout this period, many
staff members of Allied Head
quarters assisted the Tokyo Of

documents concerning occupation
policy toward Japan. Also the
Tokyo Office established three
agencies throughout Japan in

periodical titles (about 140 cur

other Asian countries which were
unsuccessful in this endeavor
until recently, American scholars

on Japan in the Hoover Institu
tion, including Russian, number
over 4,000 volumes. In addition to
its Japanese language materials,
the Japanese Collection also holds
some contemporary Korean lan
guage works.
Among major problems docu
mented in the Hoover Institution's
collection on Japan is that relat

ing 1o the broad question of mod
ernization, including its economic
and political aspects. Since Japan
was able to modernize early in
its modern history, in contrast to
other Asian countries which were
unsuccessful in this endeavor
until recently, American scholars
have in recent years become par
ticularly interested in the story
of Japan's success.
Within the Japanese Collection
there are several special collec
tions which are of interest. Among
these are photo-copies of Japanese
archival materials on Korea, com
prising some 500 folders of docu
ments originating in the Japanese
Legation in Seoul (.1894-1905), and
the Japanese Residency-General
in Korea (1906-1910),
These documents are useful for
the study of the history of .Japa
nese penetration into Korea, Since
the original documents, which
were stored in the Japanese Gov
ernment-General's Office in Seoul,
were burned at the end of the
war, only two copies remain—
those in the Hoover Institution
and those in Seoul. The latter
were partially destroyed during
the Korean War.
Another special collection con
sists of documents relating to
General Araki, who was a leading
member of the pre-war military
clique and who was tried as a
Class A war criminal by the In
ternational Military Tribunal for
the Far East. These documents,
which consist of his diary, person
al letters addressed to him, and
secret documents of the Japanese
Imperial General Staff, tell the
history of the rise of Japanese
militarism.
Since many Japanese scholars
circles visiter the Hoover Insti
tution in recent years, Japanese
and leading figures of various
journalism, TV and radio stations
have given wide publicity to its
activities. Thus, the Hoover In
stitution can easily acquire many
valuable and restricted materials
through gift and exchange pro
grams with various Japanese in
stitutions and government agen
cies.
In the Hoover Institution all
these resources are utilized for
the study of current Japanese
problems and their historical
background.
