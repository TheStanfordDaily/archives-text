The President's message is a
report on conditions at home and
abroad as the new Administration
finds them to be when it takes of
fice. The report differs sharply
fr om that of his predecessor. "The
American economy," says the
President, "is in trouble." The
problems which confront us
around the world are staggering
in their "harsh enormity." For
"the tide of events has been run
ning out and time has not been
our friend."
The crucial question is whether
the President can convince our
people that the trouble is real and
that he is not crying wolf. For the
great majority of Americans are
well off and the dangers abroad
present no immediate threat to
their comfort and tranquility. The
great tasks which the President
proposes to undertake at home
are concerned with conditions and
problems that are not immedi
ately visible to everyone, such as
the misery of the unemployed at
home or our declining power and
influence abroad. These are con
ditions which have to be seen with
the eye of the mind and the imagi
nation and felt with a compassion
ate heart. They do not seem im
portant, they do not seem real,
to those who do not realize them
—as for example the coalition in
the House of Representatives
which is conspiring—the Halleck-
Smith conspiracy is the right
name for it—to prevent the House
from acting on the Administra
tion's program.
In his message the President
spoke first of domestic affairs,
which includes the problem of the
balance of payments. This is the
true order of things. For while
our problems at home "pale when
placed beside" our problems
abroad, it is only by dealing ef
fectively with our problems at
home tiiat we can acquire the re
sources to deal with our problems
abroad.
The core of the problem at
home is that during the past seven
years the American economy has
been throttled down to a sluggish
pace. For the past few months we
have been in the third recession
of this decade. Indeed this reces
sion comes upon us after we had
failed to make a good recovery

from the previous recession of
1958. And during the whole period
since the end of the Korean war,
the growth of our economy has
been so retarded that it is the
slowest of ihe advanced industrial
economies of the non-Communist
world.
Recession imposed upon slug
gishness means not only unem
ployment and idle plant capacity
and all the rest. It means also a
chronic inability to meet our pub
lic needs at home and abroad.
This is the central problem which
must be resolved, and it would be
an intolerable injury to the na
tional interest if the Halleck*
Smith conspiracy were able to
prevent its being attacked.
As compared with the discus
sion of the domestic economy, the
passages devoted to foreign af
fairs are less informative, and in
deed more uncertain. This is due,
I believe, to the fact that while
the domestic section is founded
upon a well-known ami well-tried
modern economic philosophy,
there exists as yet no comparable
statement of American foreign
policy in the new world situation
—of Russian nuclear parity, of the
prospect achievement by China
and others of nuclear power, of
the emergence of new nations out
of their colonial past, of the
spread of what has been called
the revolution of rising expecta
tions to the Western hemisphere.
The intellectual apparatus of
our foreign policy is still that of
Acheson and Dulles and, applied
by men not of the first order of
ability to the great, conflict of
power and influence with the So
viet Union, the apparatus is serv
ing us badly. In the domestic field
the Kennedy administration is
able to draw upon a mature body
of doctrine. In foreign affairs it
has an obsolescent body of doc
trine with which to face the world,
and it has before it the task of re
studying, and revision, and re
educating before the hand-me
downs and the leftovers from
other times are discarded.
There is no need to doubt that
Ihis will be done. For while the
message shows that it has not
yet been done, there are all the
signs of a great will to do it.
