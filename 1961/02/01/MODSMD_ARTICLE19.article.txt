i Editor, The Daily:
Because of misrepresentations
| in the public report of the Encina
j food poisoning incident, we feel
!it is our duty to report what
I really occurred at Crothers and
! Crothers Memorial last Thursday
! evening.
About 8:30 p.m. several resi
dents told the R.A. that they were
jin extreme pain and suffering
! from nausea. The R.A. called the
j clinic and reported Ihe symptoms
j to the doctor on duty. Over the
j telephone the doctor diagnosed
i the trouble as "virus flu" and said
|to give them aspirin and send
them to bed. By 9:30 about 20
more residents complained of the
"virus flu" and the R.A. again
called the doctor but with the
same result. By 10 p.m. approxi
mately 30 more residents were
suffering, again the doctor was
phoned and again he refused to
come.
After the fifth call with over
80 cases reported, the doctor on
duty was finally convinced of the
seriousness of the situation and
agreed to come. Despite the doc
tor's assurance no one arrived
and per emergency instructions,
the R.A.'s attempted to reach Dr.
Houck, Director of Health Service.
The clinic switchboard operator
did refuse to let them talk to Dr.
Houck and did refuse to give Ihe
doctor's number, but this was not
the reason for the delay as re
ported, for the R.A.'s did contact
Dr. Houck. Dr. Houck assured
them that everything was all right
and refused 1o call in another doc-
I tor or appear personally.
j With still no doctor, the R.A.'s
phoned Deans Craig and Winbig
' ler hut discovered that they were
out of town. Mi*. Wert, Vice
! Provost, was called and only then
j did the residents receive the co
' operation and emergency help
that was needed. At 11:45, over
three hours after the first cases
had been reported, the first doc
tor arrived. Had this been a more
virulent type of food poisoning
such as botulism, there could haVe
been injuries with serious after
effects or even fatalities before
, medical aid arrived. Even though,
fortunately, this did riot occur, the
fact remains that 80 residents,
suffering and in pain, were kept
waiting for over three hours with
out any medical attention what
soever.
