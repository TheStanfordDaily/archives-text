# COWLEY LOOKS TO FUTURE
## ‘Novel To Be Central In American Literature’ 
### JUDY SEABORG 
"Literature is a dangerous field for prophecy." said Malcolm
Cowley last night to an overflow crowd in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
as he discussed the conditions which are producing America's future
writers, and his opinions of the type of writers these will be and the
literature they will produce.
"The world of letters."he said, "is partly ruled by tradition, which

changes very slowly, and partly
by fashion, which changes over
night." Although the novel will
"continue to be the central form
in American literature," it will be
concerned with the group or with
individuals' adjustment to the
group due to the increased popu
lation of the next ,"50 years.
THE NOVEL will be written
with greater technical skill and
may in many cases resemble non
fiction. Poetry will "stop being
elusive, become more direct, even
brutal."
Many of America's writers, the
critic felt, are in the nation's col
leges, and are developing their
potential in spite of a decline in
general in t he nation's educational
system, over-emphasis on group
adjustment. and the disappear
ance of "the old-maid school
teacher," who was a former
source of literary encouragement.
"Genius and simple ability." he
said, "are hard to suppress."
NEVER BEFORE, stated Cow
ley, have young aspiring writers
had greater opportunities to de
velop their ability while being
supported by "tax-exempt institu
tions which have replaced private
patronage." and never have young
writers found their works in such
demand. A great pitfall, however,
is that a young writer may be
come involved either too much or
too little in the world when he is
beginning.
"The new period will be a bril
liant one," said Cowley, "the be
ginning of an extremely rich
period of literature; but it is hard
to perceive what kind."
