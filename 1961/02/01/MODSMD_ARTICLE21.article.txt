Pay ton Jordan is a coach who takes his job seriously. His sport
is track and when he isn't on the cinders advising the Stanford run
ners, he's busy planning meet*, arranging schedules and generally
promoting and defending track.
His efforts, both promoting and coaching, are responsible for
much of the sport's success. Last summer Jordan got the 1960 U.S.
Olympic Track and Field Tryouts to be held on the Stanford campus
and the meet was one of the best in the history of the tryouts.
TIIK SI'KING BFFOKK the tryouts, Payton guided the Stanford
cindermen to a relay grand slam victories in the Modesto, West
Coast, Drake and Coliseum relays a feat equalled in previous years
only by Kansas and Texas. Last year the Stanford team was also
rated sixth in the naljon in dual competition.
And so when a man does so much for a sport, it's discouraging
to read the type of criticism of track that appeared in a recent issue
of Sports Illustrated. For those who didn't read it, the article, by
lined by ex-"amateur" sprinter Mike Agostini, dealt with infringe
ments of amateur track rules.
Mike, who hailed out of Trinidad and spent most of his running
days roaming the world, listed the numerous occasions on which he
accepted more than tho legal minimum, which, he adds in the SI piece,
". . . is repeated a thousandfold wherever athletes entertain Hie
public . .
THAT, IF \VK CAN value Mike's word more than in his amateur
days, means that track is just about the most corrupt pastime around.
There are many people ready to disagree with Agostini, including
Coach Jordan.
"True, there are abuses in track," explains the Card mentor, "but
they involve only a small percentage of the performers. Most of the
flagrant violations are committed by live or six of ihe top stars.
"In 21 years of competing and coaching I have seen only one case
of a possible abuse that was when a runner accepted a prize that
might possibly have been worth more than the allowed $35 value.
"CORNELIUS WARMERDA.M, the national pole vaulting cham
pion in 1940 was one of the most amateur amateurs I've ever known.
He wouldn't think of accepting anything extra. I traveled with Jesse
Owens and other of the top runners of the day, and as far as I know
none of them was making anything.
"The boys on our team are never allowed to accept anything above
expenses and the regular prizes, and none of them has ever com
plained."
Ernie Cunliffe. one of Jordan's outstanding runners on the 1960
team and now a Stanford graduate student, is currently running in
winter indoor meets. Cunliffe. who turned in a 1:47:3 880 outdoors
last season, ran his first indoor race in Boston early this month and
since has competed at Los Angeles and New York.
SAYS ERNIE, "I didn't see anyone getting any more than Ihey
were supposed to get. I received travel expenses and room and board.
Prizes were a sweater at Los Angeles, value about $20; a clock at Bos
ton. about $25 and a small travel clock at the New York meet which
was worlh around $6."
Besides the three mentioned prizep, Ernie won a three-year trophy
at New York. He doesn't get to keep it however; it will become per
manent possession of whoever wins it twice during the three years
that it is offered. If no one does that, the trophy goes to the runner
who recorded the fastest winning time—and right now that's Cun
liffe who chalked up a record 2:47:9 in the 1,000 yards.
Not Getting Rich
CUNLIFFE ISN'T getting rich running in amateur track meets.
He's running for the fun of competing, just as Jordan did in his
days as a runner and just as thousands of other athletes have done.
Some of what Agostini charges is true, but it is not widespread.
Further, Jordan feels that while the abuses are not common enough
to warrant the black eye given the sport by the SI article, they can
and ought to be stopped.
If the AAU is actually an effective governing body they certainly
can handle the problem. When it's common knowledge among
coaches, competitors and meet officials that an athlete is accepting
more remuneration than amateur rules stipulate, it shouldn't be too
hard for ihe AAU to get the same information and bar the athlete
from future meets.
AGOSTINI ENDS his article with a plea for relaxing amateur
rules: "After all, track and field is big business. The crowds don't
flock in to take a look at the officials. It is the man streaking down
the track who fires the spectator's imagination and brings him to
the arena. Top entertainers in other pursuits get paid for their
drawing power and are not constantly threatened with the stigma of
'professionalism' or suspension.
"This is my plea. Clean up athletics by cleaning up first the laws
that make men sinners. . . ."
What Mike proposes is a new way of thinking that will justify
his actions, the actions of a small minority. Such proposals would
certainly end amateur track as we know it. One wonders if values
have changed so much since the days of Warmerdam and Owens. Is
the only reason for running today—something that was pure fun
in the past—only to make money?
THERE AKK MANY examples Cunliffe and most of his fellow

alhletes — that competitors still
run for Iho joy of winning and
even just taking part.
Keep the amateur rules then.
Keep them strict; allow expenses
only and nominal prizes. And if
track and field is big business, as
Agnostini contends, theif should
be a ready demand for full-fledged,
out-in-the-open professionals. We
assume Agnostini will become one
of these.
