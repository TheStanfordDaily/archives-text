1961: YEAH OF DFXISION
Well sir. hero wf :iro in 1901, which shows every sign of being
quite ;i distinguished year. First oft, it is 11 le only year since
1951 which begins and ends with the Figure 1. Of course, when
it conies to Figure l's, 1901, though distinguished, can hardly
compare with 1911, which, most people agree, had not just two,
hut thru Figure l's! This, I'll wager, is m record that will stand
for at least two hundred years!
1911 was, incidentally, notable for many other things. It
was, for example, the year in which the New ork (liants played
the Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series. As we all know,
the New York (Jiants have since moved to San Francisco and
the Philadelphia Athletics to Kansas City. Therei<a movement
afoot at present to move Chicago to Phoenix —the city, not the
baseball team. Phoenix, in turn, would of course move to
Chicago. It is felt that the change would be broadening for
residents of both cities. Many Chicago folks, for example, have
never seen an iguana. Many Phoenix folks, on the other hand,
have never seen a frostbite.
There are. of course, certain difficulties attending a municipal
shift of this size. For instance, to move Chicago you also have
to move Lake Michigan. This, in itself, presents no great prob
lem, what with modern scientific advances like electronics and
the French cuff. But if you will look at your map, you will find
that hake Michigan is connected to all the other (Ireat Fakes,
which in turn are connected to the St. Lawrence Seaway, which

in turn is connected to the Atlantic Ocean, You start dragging
Lake Michigan to Phoenix and. willy-nilly, you'll he dragging
all that other stuff too. This would make our Rrilish allies
terribly cross, and 1 can't say as 1 blanie them. 1 mean, put
yourself in their place. What if, for example, you were a British
workingnmn who had been saving and scrimping all year for a
summer holiday at Brighton Beach, and then wlien you got to
Brighton Beach lln re wasn't any on an? There you'd he with your
inner tvlx and snorkel and nothing to do all day hut dance the
l.amheth Walk. This, you may he sure, would not make you
1 appeal most earnestly to the residents of Chicago and
Phoenix to reconsider. I know it's no howl of cherries going
through life without ever seeing an iguana or a frostbite, hut I
iisk you Ohicagoans, Phoenicians is it too big a price to pay
for preserving the unity of the free world? I am sure that if
you search your hearts you will make the right decision, for
all of n~ whether we live in frostbitten ('hicago, iguana-ridden
Phoenix, or narrow-lapelled New Haven are first and foremost
Americans!
But 1 digress. We. were speaking of 10(11, our new year. And
new it is! There is, for one thing, new pleasure in Marlboro
('igarettes. I low can there be new pleasure in Marl bonis w hen
that fine, flavorful blend, that clean easy dryw filter, have not
been altered? The answer is simple: each time you light a
Marlboro, it is like tlk* first time. The flavor is such that age
cannot wither nor custom stale. Marlboro never palls, never
jades, never dwindles into dull routine. Each pack, each
cigarette, each puff, makes you glad all over again that you are
a Marlboro smoker!
So, Marlboro* in hand, let us march confidently into 1P(»1,
May good fortune attend our ventures! May happinc-- reign!
May ( hicago and Phoenix >oon recover from their disappoint
ment and join our bright cavalcade into a brave tomorrow!
