## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD President Kennedy yesterday summoned
Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson home from Russia for top-level
talks on future U.S. policy toward Russia. He also announced that
the envoy would be assigned to the Soviet capital indefinitely.
The White House said the President and Secretary of State Dean

Rusk wanted to consult with
Thompson on "all aspects of So
viet-American relations." He is
expected to arrive in this country
about Feb. 8.
THOMPSON held a long talk
with Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev the weekend before last.
Their meeting resulted in the re
lease of two U.S. airmen who had
been imprisoned by the Russians
since their plane was shot down
by Soviet fighters on July 1.
Thompson's return will give
him a chance to report in person
on his talk with the Soviet leader.
Kennedy said in announcing the
airmen's release that the Russian
action had removed a major obsta
cle to improved U.S.-Soviet rela
tions.
Thompson's return was an
nounced as W. Averell Harriman,
Kennedy's choice for special roving
ambassador, was telling the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit lee
that he believes Khrushchev
wants to avoid a major war.
lIAKRIMAN said recent talks
with Khrushchev convinced him
that the Russian leader knows
his country would be devastated
by a nuclear war "and does not
want to see the major develop
ments of the Soviet Union de
stroyed."
White House Press Secretary
Pierre Salinger said he had no in
formation on whether Kennedy
might meet with Khrushchev if
the Soviet Premier attends the
United Nations General Assembly
meeting in New York in March.
