# Chimpanzee Survives Space Trip

### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(UPI> A highly-trained chimp
named "Ham" rocketed 155 miles
into space and 420 miles out over
the Atlantic yesterday and was
recovered alive and well in a suc
cessful prelude to manned space
flight.
The elaborate capsule contain
ing the three-and-a-half year old
j chimp was plucked from the sea
by a helicopter just two hours and
57 minutes after it was launched
from Cape Canaveral. It was
hoisted aboard the LSD Donner.
"HAM," true to his name, stop
ped out and shook hands with
waiting veterinarian Ma.j. R. E.
Benson.
Shortly after the chimp took off
: on his trail-bla/.ing flight scien
i tists on the West Coast sent a
new "Watchdog" satellite into
orbit from Point Arguello, Calif.
The satellite was designed to
keep the free world's eye on all
i parts of the globe, including So
■ viet Russia.
The 37-pound chimp was
j launched down the Atlantic Mis
' sile Range in Propect Mercury
I space craft by a souped-up Red
stone rocket which sent it 40
miles higher and 130 miles farther
than planned.
A DESTROYER, the Ellison,
was the first vessel to sight the
! space cabin, floating on its side
j about 175 miles northeast of
I Grand Bahama Island.
Two sailors were put overboard
| and attached a line to the capsule,
i which was then righted in the
water and lifted aboard the ac
: companying ship, the Donner, by
| the Marine helicopter.
In the hoisting process the cap
j sule's heavy plastic shield, which
; guards the space cabin against
heat during re-entry into the at
mosphere, fell away. It apparently
had been weakened by the impact.
