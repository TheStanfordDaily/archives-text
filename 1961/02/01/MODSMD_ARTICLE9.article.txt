PARIS <UPI> — Belgian states
; man Paul-Henri Spaak resigned
yesterday as NATO Secretary -
j General in a move expected to
l clear the way for a broad reform
of the Western Alliance.
Spaak's decision to quit and re
turn to Belgian politics was an
nounced in a terse communique
from NATO's permanent Paris
headquarters which said the for
mer Belgian Socialist premier
asked to be released "by the be
ginning of March."
In recent months he had been
under criticism by powerful forces
who maintained the organization
of the alliance needed a face-lift
ing because the era when a weak
I Western Europe faced an immedi
ate Communist threat had passed.
