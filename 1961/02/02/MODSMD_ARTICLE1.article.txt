# STATE OF UNION
## Professors Remark on Message 
### LINDA HESS 
Descriptions of President Ken
nedy's State of the Union message
ranged from "good" to "extraor
dinary," with no averse comments
from four Stanford professors in
the schools of Political Science,
History, and Law.
Kennedy, whose message em
phasized the domestic problems,
international crises, and demands
for sacrifice facing America in
the coming years, was met with
a chorus of criticism by Republi
cans throughout the country.
GOP Senator Styles Bridges la
belled the speech a disservice to
the nation, and other Washington
Republicans were equally vocal in
their censure of the President.
THERE SEEMED to be less
dissension among the four profes
sors interviewed by the Daily.
They unanimously praised Ken
nedy for his realistic grasp of the
situation and his straightforward
presentation to the nation.
Robert Walker, Executive Head
of the Political Science Dept.,
called the message "a good speech
for its purpose, which was to set
the tone for the administration
and its policies." In reference to
accusations that Kennedy was ov
erly pessimistic, Walker com
mented. "He simply stated the
situation as it is, and the situation
is bad. I don't think there was
anything pessimistic about it. He
is facing up to problems, espe
cially domestic problems, more
realistically than his predecessors
did."
GRAHAM STUART, Professor
Emeritus in Political Science and
specialist in international law and
diplomacy, also spoke favorably
of Kennedy's address. Stuart,
whose book on American diplo
macy is used as a standard hand
book by U.S. foreign service offi
cers, had this to say about Ken
nedy's foreign policy: "In foreign
service he's made a number of
forward steps. He has realized
the importance of career diplo
mats, and he has wisely decided
that summit conferences are not
as effective as normal diplomatic
channels. I like his appointments,
particularly Sec. of State Dean
Rusk. . .
Stuart observed that Kennedy's
pessimism may have been some
what exaggerated, but he justi
fied this possibility on the
grounds that "he was trying to
impress the American people with
just what they're up against."
OTIS PEASE, Associate Profes
sor of History, noted two signifi
cant aspects of the presidential
address, one directed chiefly at
the general public, the other di
rected at the legislators: "First,
lie was probably being exceeding
ly fiank in trying to make the
public as aware as possible of the
difficulties a departure from the
previous administration." Second,
he was telling the Congress that
if they didn't support him in his
proposed change of the House
Rules Committee, they could be
accused of "failure to support him
in a grave hour."
Another favorable evaluation
was made by Carl Spaeth. Dean
of the Law School: "I think that
President Kennedy showed an ex
traordinary grasp of a wide
range of problems in government
. . . he's calling his shots as he
sees them."

Rusk. . .
Stuart observed that Kennedy's
pessimism may have been some
what exaggerated, but he justi
fied this possibility on the
grounds that "he was trying to
impress the American people with
just what they're up against."
OTIS PEASE, Associate Profes
sor of History, noted two signifi
cant aspects of the presidential
address, one directed chiefly at
the general public, the other di
rected at the legislators: "First,
lie was probably being exceeding
ly fiank in trying to make the
public as aware as possible of the
difficulties a departure from the
previous administration." Second,
he was telling the Congress that
if they didn't support him in his
proposed change of the House
Rules Committee, they could be
accused of "failure to support him
in a grave hour."
Another favorable evaluation
was made by Carl Spaeth. Dean
of the Law School: "I think that
President Kennedy showed an ex
traordinary grasp of a wide
range of problems in government
. . . he's calling his shots as he
sees them."
Descriptions of President Ken
nedy's State of the Union message
ranged from "good" to "extraor
dinary," with no averse comments
from four Stanford professors in
the schools of Political Science,
History, and Law.
Kennedy, whose message em
phasized the domestic problems,
international crises, and demands
for sacrifice facing America in
the coming years, was met with
a chorus of criticism by Republi
cans throughout the country.
GOP Senator Styles Bridges la
belled the speech a disservice to
the nation, and other Washington
Republicans were equally vocal in
their censure of the President.
THERE SEEMED to be less
dissension among the four profes
sors interviewed by the Daily.
They unanimously praised Ken
nedy for his realistic grasp of the
situation and his straightforward
presentation to the nation.
Robert Walker, Executive Head
of the Political Science Dept.,
called the message "a good speech
for its purpose, which was to set
the tone for the administration
and its policies." In reference to
accusations that Kennedy was ov
erly pessimistic, Walker com
mented. "He simply stated the
situation as it is, and the situation
is bad. I don't think there was
anything pessimistic about it. He
is facing up to problems, espe
cially domestic problems, more
realistically than his predecessors
did."
GRAHAM STUART, Professor
Emeritus in Political Science and
specialist in international law and
diplomacy, also spoke favorably
of Kennedy's address. Stuart,
whose book on American diplo
macy is used as a standard hand
book by U.S. foreign service offi
cers, had this to say about Ken
nedy's foreign policy: "In foreign
service he's made a number of
forward steps. He has realized
the importance of career diplo
mats, and he has wisely decided
that summit conferences are not
as effective as normal diplomatic
channels. I like his appointments,
particularly Sec. of State Dean
Rusk. . .
