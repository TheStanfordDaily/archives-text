RECIFE, Brazil (UPIi - Captive passengers aboard the hijacked
Portuguese cruise ship Santa Maria shouted last night to passing
boats that their Portuguese rebel captors would land them today,
just before their fresh water supply gives out.
Shortage of food and water aboard the broiling-hot vessel, the

threat of mutiny by tlie crew and
growing official impatience over
l-ebel demands for guarantees
that they can keep the ship
pointed to a final settlement yes
terday of the 12-day buccaneering
odyssey from the Spanish Main
to this tropic Brazilian port just
south of the equator.
The rebels of the Santa Maria
are holding their ship out from
land and tension among the crew
men and passengers aboard is ris
ing. The passengers said they are
coming ashore today but Galvao
still is trying to get guarantees
from Bra/.il that he will be able
to keep the ship.
New Brazilian President Janio
Quadros sent a message to Hen
rique Galvao just before mid
night last night via "official chan
nels," according to the presiden
tial secretary in Brasilia.
ADVICES in Rio De Janeiro
said Quadros .who has granted
the rebels asylum if they want it,
might also lot them leave Recife
unmolested with the ship if the
passengers and all crewmen de
siring to disembark are first put
ashore.
The U.S. Navy declared last
night tho ship was in Brazilian
waters and it said it was with
drawing from the chase, leaving
the fate of the liner, and its 620
passengers .including 42 Ameri
cans, up to Brazil.
A Brazilian navy spokesman in
sisted tho vessel still was in in
ternational waters.
THK SANTA Maria .which be
came the scene of a floating revo
lution when seized by opponents
of the Portuguese government,
was at the mouth of Recife har
bor, three miles off shore. Most
estimates placed it inside Brazil
ian waters.
This was the situation on the
12th day since the 70-man band
under Galvao seized t he ship at
gunpoint to strike a blow against
Portuguese Premier Antonio De
Oliveria Salazar:
The rebels demanded possession
of the ship as well as asylum.
Brazilian officials said there
was "anguish" aboard. Nerves
were near breaking.
Crewmen whispered to visiting
Brazilian officials that they
planned mutiny. A number said
they would jump overboard.
There were reports some crew
! men were armed and would attack
j the rebels in a "counter-revolt"
aboard.
Signs of wear and tear appeared
[on the soot-stained slacks and the
rust-streaked hull of the once
gay liner. j
