### NICHOLAS HEER Curator, Middle East Collection 
(Editor's Note: This is the sev
en! Ii in a series of eight articles
on the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace. Today's
article is about the Middle East
Collection.)

The Middle East Collection
deals primarily with the political
developments from the middle of
the nineteenth century to the
present. The collection is divided
into three language divisions:
Turkish, Arabic and Persian .
The Turkish Collection, amount
ing to about 6,500 volumes, has
the most complete documentation.
It is, in fact, one of the finest
Turkish Collections in the United
States and has attracted a number
of Turkish scholars to Stanford.
The Arabic Collection, contain
ing approximately 7,000 volumes,
is not as complete in its documen
tation as the Turkish, since it
covers a much larger area (Mo
rocco to Iraq and Saudi Arabia).
The Persian Collection is much
smaller than either of the other
two (400 volumes), but contains
much important material dealing
with (he modern history of Iran,
such as many of the publications
of the Communist (Tudeh) Party.
In addition to these three col
lections, there is a large amount
of Western language material
published bolh in the Middle East
and in the West, which is incor
porated into the general collec
tions of the Hoover Institution.
Additions to the Middle East
Collection continue to be made
regularly. Acquisitions of new
books in Arabic and Turkish
amount to approximately 600 vol
umes yearly. In addition to these
the Library currently subscribes
to 65 magazines and 25 news
papers from the Middle East and
North Africa.
The Turkish Collection: It cov
ers chiefly about 1875 to the pres
ent. A large proportion was ac
quired through the purchase in
1952 of the private library of
Saadet Dageviren, which formed
the nucleus around which the re
mainder of the collection has been
developed. The Turkish Collection
is especially fine for the period of
the Constitutional Sultanate (1908-
22), but both the preceding period
and that of the Republic are well
documented. Also documented are
a number of problems connected
with foreign relations, social or
ganization, religion, capitulations,
minorities, education.
The Arabic Collection: Unlike
the Turkish and Persian Collec

lions, the Arabic Collection in
cludes materials dealing; with the
medieval period (600 to 1500) as
well as the modern period (1800 to
present).
In 1949 the Institution pur
chased the J. Hey worth-Dunne
collection, which contained a fine
collection of medieval historical
and literary texts as well as many
texts in the field of religion and
philosophy and a fine collection of
Arabic folklore.
Materials dealing with the mod
ern period can be roughly divided
into three main categories:
1) Materials documenting polit
ical movements In the Arab world
Included here is material on rail-
Islamic and Islamic reform and
the revolutionary movements such
as those of Jamal al-l)in al-Af
ghani Muhammad 'Ahduh and the
Moslems Brotherhood; almost
complete documentation for the
Arab nationalist movement from
the first World War to the pres
ent; extensive material on local
nationalist movements such as
Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian
nationalism; various Communist
Party publications; material on
the revolutions in Egypt (1952)
and in Iraq (1958), etc.
2) Government publications. In
cluded in this category are the of
ficial gazettes of the NAR, Leb
anon, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain and Morocco.
Also included are collections of
laws, parliamentary debates, con
stitutions, treaties, etc.; propa
ganda of various sorts for both
home and foreign consumption;
publications of government min
istries; material published by the
Arab League and various Pan-
Arab conferences; publications of
provisional governments (i.e., Al
geria) and governments in exile
(i.e., Oman).
3) Materials dealing with the
modernization of the area. Under
this category is included material
on industrialization, agricultural
reform, education, oil, legal re
form, etc.
The Persian Collection: For a
number of years no Persian acqui
sitions have been made due to a
limited budget. Material of par
ticular significance includes some
100 volumes and pamphlets pub
lished by the Tudeh (Communist )
Party of Persia. The collection
also includes a complete file
(1906-48) of the legislation of the
Parliament containing all laws
and treaties of the Persian gov
ernment during this period, and
documentation for Azerbaijanian
and Kurdish revolutionary activ
ities in 1945-46.

Included here is material on rail-
Islamic and Islamic reform and
the revolutionary movements such
as those of Jamal al-l)in al-Af
ghani Muhammad 'Ahduh and the
Moslems Brotherhood; almost
complete documentation for the
Arab nationalist movement from
the first World War to the pres
ent; extensive material on local
nationalist movements such as
Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian
nationalism; various Communist
Party publications; material on
the revolutions in Egypt (1952)
and in Iraq (1958), etc.
2) Government publications. In
cluded in this category are the of
ficial gazettes of the NAR, Leb
anon, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain and Morocco.
Also included are collections of
laws, parliamentary debates, con
stitutions, treaties, etc.; propa
ganda of various sorts for both
home and foreign consumption;
publications of government min
istries; material published by the
Arab League and various Pan-
Arab conferences; publications of

3) Materials dealing with the
modernization of the area. Under
this category is included material
on industrialization, agricultural
reform, education, oil, legal re
form, etc.
The Persian Collection: For a
number of years no Persian acqui
sitions have been made due to a
limited budget. Material of par
ticular significance includes some
100 volumes and pamphlets pub
lished by the Tudeh (Communist )
Party of Persia. The collection
also includes a complete file
(1906-48) of the legislation of the
Parliament containing all laws

ernment during this period, and
documentation for Azerbaijanian
and Kurdish revolutionary activ
ities in 1945-46.

Collection.)

The Middle East Collection
deals primarily with the political
developments from the middle of
the nineteenth century to the
present. The collection is divided
into three language divisions:
Turkish, Arabic and Persian .
The Turkish Collection, amount
ing to about 6,500 volumes, has
the most complete documentation.
It is, in fact, one of the finest
Turkish Collections in the United
States and has attracted a number
of Turkish scholars to Stanford.
The Arabic Collection, contain
ing approximately 7,000 volumes,
is not as complete in its documen
tation as the Turkish, since it
covers a much larger area (Mo
rocco to Iraq and Saudi Arabia).
The Persian Collection is much
smaller than either of the other
two (400 volumes), but contains
much important material dealing
with (he modern history of Iran,
such as many of the publications
of the Communist (Tudeh) Party.
In addition to these three col
lections, there is a large amount
of Western language material
published bolh in the Middle East
and in the West, which is incor
porated into the general collec
tions of the Hoover Institution.
Additions to the Middle East
Collection continue to be made
regularly. Acquisitions of new
books in Arabic and Turkish
amount to approximately 600 vol
umes yearly. In addition to these
the Library currently subscribes
to 65 magazines and 25 news
papers from the Middle East and
North Africa.
The Turkish Collection: It cov
ers chiefly about 1875 to the pres
ent. A large proportion was ac
quired through the purchase in
1952 of the private library of
Saadet Dageviren, which formed
the nucleus around which the re
mainder of the collection has been
developed. The Turkish Collection
is especially fine for the period of
the Constitutional Sultanate (1908-
22), but both the preceding period
and that of the Republic are well
documented. Also documented are
a number of problems connected
with foreign relations, social or
ganization, religion, capitulations,
minorities, education.
The Arabic Collection: Unlike
the Turkish and Persian Collec

lions, the Arabic Collection in
cludes materials dealing; with the
medieval period (600 to 1500) as
well as the modern period (1800 to
present).
In 1949 the Institution pur
chased the J. Hey worth-Dunne
collection, which contained a fine
collection of medieval historical
and literary texts as well as many
texts in the field of religion and
philosophy and a fine collection of
Arabic folklore.

ern period can be roughly divided
into three main categories:

lections, there is a large amount
of Western language material
published bolh in the Middle East
and in the West, which is incor
porated into the general collec
tions of the Hoover Institution.
Additions to the Middle East
Collection continue to be made
regularly. Acquisitions of new
books in Arabic and Turkish
amount to approximately 600 vol
umes yearly. In addition to these
the Library currently subscribes
to 65 magazines and 25 news
papers from the Middle East and
North Africa.
The Turkish Collection: It cov
ers chiefly about 1875 to the pres
ent. A large proportion was ac
quired through the purchase in
1952 of the private library of
Saadet Dageviren, which formed
the nucleus around which the re
mainder of the collection has been
developed. The Turkish Collection
is especially fine for the period of
the Constitutional Sultanate (1908-
22), but both the preceding period
and that of the Republic are well
documented. Also documented are
a number of problems connected
with foreign relations, social or
ganization, religion, capitulations,
minorities, education.
The Arabic Collection: Unlike
the Turkish and Persian Collec

lions, the Arabic Collection in
cludes materials dealing; with the
medieval period (600 to 1500) as
well as the modern period (1800 to
present).
In 1949 the Institution pur
chased the J. Hey worth-Dunne
collection, which contained a fine
collection of medieval historical
and literary texts as well as many
texts in the field of religion and
philosophy and a fine collection of
Arabic folklore.
Materials dealing with the mod
ern period can be roughly divided
into three main categories:
1) Materials documenting polit
ical movements In the Arab world
Included here is material on rail-
Islamic and Islamic reform and
the revolutionary movements such
as those of Jamal al-l)in al-Af
ghani Muhammad 'Ahduh and the
Moslems Brotherhood; almost
complete documentation for the
Arab nationalist movement from
the first World War to the pres
ent; extensive material on local
nationalist movements such as
Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian
nationalism; various Communist
Party publications; material on
the revolutions in Egypt (1952)
and in Iraq (1958), etc.
2) Government publications. In
cluded in this category are the of
ficial gazettes of the NAR, Leb
anon, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain and Morocco.
Also included are collections of
laws, parliamentary debates, con
stitutions, treaties, etc.; propa
ganda of various sorts for both
home and foreign consumption;
publications of government min
istries; material published by the
Arab League and various Pan-
Arab conferences; publications of
provisional governments (i.e., Al
geria) and governments in exile
(i.e., Oman).
3) Materials dealing with the
modernization of the area. Under
this category is included material
on industrialization, agricultural
reform, education, oil, legal re
form, etc.
The Persian Collection: For a
number of years no Persian acqui
sitions have been made due to a
limited budget. Material of par
ticular significance includes some
100 volumes and pamphlets pub
lished by the Tudeh (Communist )
Party of Persia. The collection
also includes a complete file
(1906-48) of the legislation of the
Parliament containing all laws
and treaties of the Persian gov
ernment during this period, and
documentation for Azerbaijanian
and Kurdish revolutionary activ
ities in 1945-46.

The Middle East Collection
deals primarily with the political
developments from the middle of
the nineteenth century to the
present. The collection is divided
into three language divisions:
Turkish, Arabic and Persian .
The Turkish Collection, amount
ing to about 6,500 volumes, has
the most complete documentation.
It is, in fact, one of the finest
Turkish Collections in the United
States and has attracted a number
of Turkish scholars to Stanford.
The Arabic Collection, contain
ing approximately 7,000 volumes,
is not as complete in its documen
tation as the Turkish, since it
covers a much larger area (Mo
rocco to Iraq and Saudi Arabia).
The Persian Collection is much
smaller than either of the other
two (400 volumes), but contains
much important material dealing
with (he modern history of Iran,
such as many of the publications
of the Communist (Tudeh) Party.
In addition to these three col
lections, there is a large amount
of Western language material
published bolh in the Middle East
and in the West, which is incor
