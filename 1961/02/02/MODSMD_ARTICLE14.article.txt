The Old Boy screams in agony j
when someone dares to state the I
obvious; the Chaparral isn't
funny any more. Stanford is prob
ably the only major U.S. college
regularly publishing a parody on
college humor magazines. All the
ingredients are there: bold-line
drawings, roceptioned photos, im
probable story titles—but some
how the humor is missing.
Chappie's dilemma is apparent
to anyone who's over tried writing
for that mag: A small in-group of
lavish self-admirers is firmly in |
editorial control. IF you hang
around the shack long enough,
and IF you laugh at the right
jokes at the right times, and IF
you're willing to write official
Chaparral jokes in official Chap
arral style, why then you too can
be a campus humor king.
A word of advice to the Old
Boy: wearing a peaked hat and j
shooting down critics won't cure l
Chappie's tired blood. Kick out
the palace guard and let Stan
ford's natural good humor flow
back into the magazine.

it "is not a question of discrimi
nation; it is the question of the
right of personal contract and
the right of association." Exactly.
Why. then, does ho suggest that
the Beta Psi chapter lose its
charter for believing in his ideas?
He is apparently torn between
his loyalties to The American
Way and the national fraternity.
If ho chooses to side with the na
tional, he is then in violation of
his pledge against discriminating
against the Beta Psi chapter.
lie is refusing them the Ameri
can right of association. If Mr.
Delano wishes to call the right to
boot the Beta Psi chapter God
given. he has arbitrarily made a
decision that belongs to a power
somewhat above his level.

The Old Boy screams in agony j
when someone dares to state the I
obvious; the Chaparral isn't
funny any more. Stanford is prob
ably the only major U.S. college
regularly publishing a parody on
college humor magazines. All the
ingredients are there: bold-line
drawings, roceptioned photos, im
probable story titles—but some
how the humor is missing.
Chappie's dilemma is apparent
to anyone who's over tried writing
for that mag: A small in-group of
lavish self-admirers is firmly in |
editorial control. IF you hang
around the shack long enough,
and IF you laugh at the right
jokes at the right times, and IF
you're willing to write official
Chaparral jokes in official Chap
arral style, why then you too can
be a campus humor king.
A word of advice to the Old
Boy: wearing a peaked hat and j
shooting down critics won't cure l
Chappie's tired blood. Kick out
the palace guard and let Stan
ford's natural good humor flow
