Editor, The Daily:
The visit of the Honorable
Barry M. Goldwater to our cam
pus undoubtedly will evoke specu
lations concerning his chances for
becoming the Republican Presi
dential nominee in 3964. Here,
then, is one theory.
It is generally believed that Ihe
President in power usually has
an advantage at the polls when
his own re-election is at stake.
Surely Vice President Nixon and
Governor Rockefeller are aware
of such a possible advantage.
Moreover, as Senator Margaret
Chase Smith recently observed, a
tendency toward a middle-of-the
road approach to national prob
lems may cause President Ken
nedy to bo less vulnerable to Re
publican attacks in 1961 than had
earlier been thought. There is al
ways the chance, too however
slight, that Kennedy might turn
out to be a strong and popular
President.
Nixon and Rockefeller are both
comparatively young men; either
can easily afford to wait until
1968 when Kennedy is constitu
tionally out of the way. Mean
while, an understudy must be
found for the 1964 performance.
Conveniently there is Senator
Goldwater whose services to his
party are certainly deserving of
recognition, if not true gratitude.
Nixon cannot afford to be de
feated twice, and Rockefeller, pre
sumably, would prefer not to be
defeated once.
Thus the future looks promis
ing as far as the nomination is
concerned. Should Senator Gold
water indicate a willingness to
accept the nomination in '64, he
might find it more than welcome
by his two ostensibly chief rivals.
If the theory is right, one could
look forward eagerly to the '64
debates!
