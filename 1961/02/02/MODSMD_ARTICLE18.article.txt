The purpose of this will bo to present tho results of the San
Francisco Chronicle's football poll which was reprinted in The
Daily last week. W'c feel that we ought to back into this and do all
the necessary hedging on just what the results ol the poll mean first
and then offer the numbers for your inspection.
The poll was filled out by 254 people. It presents, we feel, a good
cross-section of University opinion. A large number of ballots was
received from the faculty and administration, many were brought
in or mailed individually from all over campus and many more were
brought and mailed in bunches from the Row (including tho ballots
from 11 like-minded gals al Roth Mouse, all of which were marked
out identically down to the last erasure by whoever it. was who de
rided to make them all the same).
The poll was, as some people were kind enough to point out, in
ferior in some respects, Suit we found the major delect to he the dif
ficulty in tabulating Ihe results. We took pains <o correct this diffi
culty as best we could, and in (lie process came up Willi our own
tabulation method. 11 may or may not he the best, but it makes some
kind of sense out of the tiling.
The major problem came in tabulating the fourth question, which
was the most important. The question asked if you favored de
emphasis of football at Stanford and gave four examples of that
much-abused word. Some people checked more than one kind. For
instance they said that they would favor cutting football back to an
intra-mural sport AND that they would favor getting rid of football
entirely. Other people checked two or more of the other possibilities.
Now it seems to us that either you favor Ihe intra-mural kind of
football OR you favor getting rid of it completely. But you can't
really favor both. Obviously the people that checked more than one
item meant that they thought either of their choices better than the
current situation.
Kut we quite arbitrarily decided Ihat it would he a good thing
to see how many people want ANY kind of a change in Stanford's
present level of football, so when a ballot came in indicating more
than one kind of change desired, we put the mark in the most ex
treme change. Thus if a ballot was marked for both intra-mural foot
ball and abolition of football, the mark was put only in abolition.
Thus, we can add up all the tallies of section 4 and come up with the
number of people who think Stanford ought to change, in some way
or another, its emphasis on football.
Time for a Change?
Having hedged to this extent, then, here are the results of the poll.
Starting with question 4. Would you favor cutting football back
to the level of an intra-mural sport? Two people said yes. Again,
more than two people checked this square, but they also checked the
one for abandoning football entirely.
Would you favor low-pressure football for Stanford and Cal such
as Santa Clara and USF have? Twenty-eight said yes. Would you
favor Ivy League standards? The largest number of those wanting
a change checked this one. 58. Do you favor abandoning football en
tirely? Twenty-eight said yes.
Adding these up we have 101 out of 25-1 people wanting some
kind of a change in Stanford's level of football.
The rest of ihe poll looks like this:
3. It is said that rigid admission stand- Yes No No Opinion
aids at Stanford and the University of
California have excluded top athletes
and sapped the quality of their foot
ball teams:
a. Do you agree with this statement? 131 TG 21.
b. Do you think high-quality football
can be expected from teams made
up of high-quality students? 130 01 8
c. Do you think high admission re
quirements are primarily respon
sible for Stanford's winless 1960
season? 50 1 ."0 10
d. For California's poor season? 23 138 50
2. Intercollegiate football competition is
said by some to he beneficial to par
ticipating students, by others to be vi
ciously over-emphasized:
a. Do you believe it fosters character
and sportsmanship and encourages
success in life? 133 00 21
b. Do you think it interferes unduly
with academic work? 83 132 5
c. Do you consider that at Stanford
and UC the football system has en
couraged under-the-table deals, hy
pocrisy and professionalism? 45 141 23
d. Do you favor special financial as
sistance for deserving athletes? 105 115 8
3. All college sports depend in part on
football receipts for their support:
a. Do you believe intercollegiate sports
should be forced to be self-support
ing without subsidy from the Uni
versity? 53 100 0
b. As an alumnus or alumna do you
attend football games as frequently
when your team is losing as when
it is winning? 00 23 55
c. Arc you willing to pay as much to
see a college football game as a
pro game? 125 51 10
Enough of polls. We'll send the results to the Chronicle and let
them figure it all out.
Time for a Change
Beginning Monday a new regime takes over The Daily and Ken
Dery will move into the creaky old swivel chair behind the Sports
Desk. His credentials need no checking into as Dery lias tied the
world's record for taking the shortest time to become Daily sports
editor: one year after joining the sports staff. We wish him luck and
as much of a ball with this job as we've had.

Enough of polls. We'll send the results to the Chronicle and let
them figure it all out.
Time for a Change
Beginning Monday a new regime takes over The Daily and Ken
Dery will move into the creaky old swivel chair behind the Sports
Desk. His credentials need no checking into as Dery lias tied the
world's record for taking the shortest time to become Daily sports
editor: one year after joining the sports staff. We wish him luck and
as much of a ball with this job as we've had.

The purpose of this will bo to present tho results of the San
Francisco Chronicle's football poll which was reprinted in The
Daily last week. W'c feel that we ought to back into this and do all
the necessary hedging on just what the results ol the poll mean first
and then offer the numbers for your inspection.
The poll was filled out by 254 people. It presents, we feel, a good
cross-section of University opinion. A large number of ballots was
received from the faculty and administration, many were brought
in or mailed individually from all over campus and many more were
brought and mailed in bunches from the Row (including tho ballots
from 11 like-minded gals al Roth Mouse, all of which were marked
out identically down to the last erasure by whoever it. was who de
rided to make them all the same).
The poll was, as some people were kind enough to point out, in
ferior in some respects, Suit we found the major delect to he the dif
ficulty in tabulating Ihe results. We took pains <o correct this diffi
culty as best we could, and in (lie process came up Willi our own
tabulation method. 11 may or may not he the best, but it makes some
kind of sense out of the tiling.
The major problem came in tabulating the fourth question, which
was the most important. The question asked if you favored de
emphasis of football at Stanford and gave four examples of that
much-abused word. Some people checked more than one kind. For
instance they said that they would favor cutting football back to an
intra-mural sport AND that they would favor getting rid of football
entirely. Other people checked two or more of the other possibilities.
Now it seems to us that either you favor Ihe intra-mural kind of
football OR you favor getting rid of it completely. But you can't
really favor both. Obviously the people that checked more than one
item meant that they thought either of their choices better than the
current situation.
Kut we quite arbitrarily decided Ihat it would he a good thing
to see how many people want ANY kind of a change in Stanford's
present level of football, so when a ballot came in indicating more
than one kind of change desired, we put the mark in the most ex
treme change. Thus if a ballot was marked for both intra-mural foot
ball and abolition of football, the mark was put only in abolition.
Thus, we can add up all the tallies of section 4 and come up with the
number of people who think Stanford ought to change, in some way
or another, its emphasis on football.
Time for a Change?
Having hedged to this extent, then, here are the results of the poll.
Starting with question 4. Would you favor cutting football back
to the level of an intra-mural sport? Two people said yes. Again,
more than two people checked this square, but they also checked the
one for abandoning football entirely.
Would you favor low-pressure football for Stanford and Cal such
as Santa Clara and USF have? Twenty-eight said yes. Would you
favor Ivy League standards? The largest number of those wanting
a change checked this one. 58. Do you favor abandoning football en
tirely? Twenty-eight said yes.
Adding these up we have 101 out of 25-1 people wanting some
kind of a change in Stanford's level of football.
The rest of ihe poll looks like this:
3. It is said that rigid admission stand- Yes No No Opinion
aids at Stanford and the University of
California have excluded top athletes
and sapped the quality of their foot
ball teams:
a. Do you agree with this statement? 131 TG 21.
b. Do you think high-quality football
can be expected from teams made
up of high-quality students? 130 01 8
c. Do you think high admission re
quirements are primarily respon
sible for Stanford's winless 1960
season? 50 1 ."0 10
d. For California's poor season? 23 138 50
2. Intercollegiate football competition is
said by some to he beneficial to par
ticipating students, by others to be vi
ciously over-emphasized:
a. Do you believe it fosters character
and sportsmanship and encourages
success in life? 133 00 21

Having hedged to this extent, then, here are the results of the poll.
Starting with question 4. Would you favor cutting football back
to the level of an intra-mural sport? Two people said yes. Again,
more than two people checked this square, but they also checked the
one for abandoning football entirely.
Would you favor low-pressure football for Stanford and Cal such
as Santa Clara and USF have? Twenty-eight said yes. Would you
favor Ivy League standards? The largest number of those wanting
a change checked this one. 58. Do you favor abandoning football en
tirely? Twenty-eight said yes.
Adding these up we have 101 out of 25-1 people wanting some
kind of a change in Stanford's level of football.
The rest of ihe poll looks like this:
3. It is said that rigid admission stand- Yes No No Opinion
aids at Stanford and the University of
California have excluded top athletes
and sapped the quality of their foot
ball teams:
a. Do you agree with this statement? 131 TG 21.
b. Do you think high-quality football
can be expected from teams made
up of high-quality students? 130 01 8
c. Do you think high admission re
quirements are primarily respon
sible for Stanford's winless 1960
season? 50 1 ."0 10
d. For California's poor season? 23 138 50
2. Intercollegiate football competition is
said by some to he beneficial to par
ticipating students, by others to be vi
ciously over-emphasized:
a. Do you believe it fosters character
and sportsmanship and encourages
success in life? 133 00 21
b. Do you think it interferes unduly
with academic work? 83 132 5
c. Do you consider that at Stanford
and UC the football system has en
couraged under-the-table deals, hy
pocrisy and professionalism? 45 141 23
d. Do you favor special financial as
sistance for deserving athletes? 105 115 8
3. All college sports depend in part on
football receipts for their support:
a. Do you believe intercollegiate sports
should be forced to be self-support
ing without subsidy from the Uni
versity? 53 100 0
b. As an alumnus or alumna do you
attend football games as frequently
when your team is losing as when
it is winning? 00 23 55
c. Arc you willing to pay as much to
see a college football game as a
pro game? 125 51 10
Enough of polls. We'll send the results to the Chronicle and let
them figure it all out.
Time for a Change
Beginning Monday a new regime takes over The Daily and Ken
Dery will move into the creaky old swivel chair behind the Sports
Desk. His credentials need no checking into as Dery lias tied the
world's record for taking the shortest time to become Daily sports
editor: one year after joining the sports staff. We wish him luck and
as much of a ball with this job as we've had.

The purpose of this will bo to present tho results of the San
Francisco Chronicle's football poll which was reprinted in The
Daily last week. W'c feel that we ought to back into this and do all
the necessary hedging on just what the results ol the poll mean first
and then offer the numbers for your inspection.
The poll was filled out by 254 people. It presents, we feel, a good
cross-section of University opinion. A large number of ballots was
received from the faculty and administration, many were brought
in or mailed individually from all over campus and many more were
brought and mailed in bunches from the Row (including tho ballots
from 11 like-minded gals al Roth Mouse, all of which were marked
out identically down to the last erasure by whoever it. was who de
rided to make them all the same).
The poll was, as some people were kind enough to point out, in
ferior in some respects, Suit we found the major delect to he the dif
ficulty in tabulating Ihe results. We took pains <o correct this diffi
culty as best we could, and in (lie process came up Willi our own
tabulation method. 11 may or may not he the best, but it makes some
kind of sense out of the tiling.
The major problem came in tabulating the fourth question, which
was the most important. The question asked if you favored de
emphasis of football at Stanford and gave four examples of that
much-abused word. Some people checked more than one kind. For
instance they said that they would favor cutting football back to an
intra-mural sport AND that they would favor getting rid of football
entirely. Other people checked two or more of the other possibilities.
Now it seems to us that either you favor Ihe intra-mural kind of
football OR you favor getting rid of it completely. But you can't
really favor both. Obviously the people that checked more than one
item meant that they thought either of their choices better than the
current situation.
Kut we quite arbitrarily decided Ihat it would he a good thing
to see how many people want ANY kind of a change in Stanford's
present level of football, so when a ballot came in indicating more
than one kind of change desired, we put the mark in the most ex
treme change. Thus if a ballot was marked for both intra-mural foot
ball and abolition of football, the mark was put only in abolition.
Thus, we can add up all the tallies of section 4 and come up with the
number of people who think Stanford ought to change, in some way
or another, its emphasis on football.
