# Socialist Editor Blasts News Coverage in U.S.
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
"The American press is failing to give the public the truth about
the Cold War," James Aronson, editor of the National Guardian, a
Socialist weekly, charged last night.
"We are miserably ill informed . . . or misinformed," and whether
it is deliberate or from negligence, "it is a criminal offense," he said.

Mass communications are vital in
forming intelligent opinions, and
if we make the wrong decisions
"we stand in danger of blowing
ourselves up," Aronson said.
"Freedom of the press" in this
country involves a basic accept
ance of the fact that our way of
life is good and all other ways are
evil," he said. He said America's
media of mass communications
under the protection of the First
Amendment have become a privi
leged class and the dominant pro
tector of the power elite in this
country.
THE PRIOSS practically echoes
government policy or anticipates
government action, according to
Aronson.
Aronson said his impression of
newspapermen covering Khrush
chev's tour of the United States
was men who had brainwashed
themselves. While Aronson felt
hope for an end to the cold war,
newsmen seemed to be interested
in maintaining Ihe cold war, he
said. Aronson charged the coun
ter-attack shown in the press with
producing the U-2 incident, the
summit breakdown, and the Cu
ban crisis.
ARONSON said the press mis
represented Khrushchev's propo
sal for disarmament. Aronson
considered the proposal serious
and practical.
Ho also called reporting of the
Cuban situation a "masterpiece of
distortion in American .journal
ism." Newspapers reported the
privations of Cubans and gauged
resistance to Castro, but they
never asked the man on I he street
what he thought, inspected the
new building projects, or wrote of
the new union leadership replac
ing the corrupt leadership under
Batista, he said.
He charged newspapers with
failing to print the facts about
Castro's high intellectual and po
litical standing, saying that Cas
tro is a Doctor of Laws.
ARONSON criticized Iho press
for its treatment of deposed
Congo Premier Lumumba, who
had greatly impressed American
leaders before he came to power,
according to Aronson.
While admitting he is a severe
critic of the press, Aronson said,
"Don't get me wrong; I love
journalism." He resigned from
the New York Times 12 years ago
to found the Manchester Guar
dian, an independent radical pub
lication to serve as a severe critic
of American policies. His paper
has taken stands against the
Korean War and the House Com
mittee on Un-American Activities.
Aronson said wire services stick
closer to the facts than by-line
reporters for biy newspapers, but
that the press associations arc
also given to printing unverified
news.
