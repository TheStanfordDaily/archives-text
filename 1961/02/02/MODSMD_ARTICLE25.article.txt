# Card Cagers Head North After Layoff
## 
### 
COACH Howie Dallmar's Sinn
ford Indians, idle last weekend,
head into the Northwest Friday
and Saturday nights meeting
Washington an d Washington
Stale University.
Saturday night's opponents, the
Cougars of WSU, seem to be a
fairly tough outfit.
The fine sophomore team of
1959-60 has returned intact and
all inideations show that last sea
son's 13-13 mark will be improved.
TIIRKK of last year's starters
are back. Forwards Charlie Sells
and Dwighl Damon and guard
Terry Ball are just juniors but
very experienced.
The success of this Cougar team
depends whether or not Coach
Marv Harshman can find replace
ments for John Maras at center
and Doyle Wilson at guard.

Ernie Woods, a part-time regu
lar at guard, and Larry Carlson,
a 6-.") forward up from the frosh,
are the best bets to add the need
ed support and have shown prom
ise iti earlier games.
Neil Dirom, a 6-7 squad member
from last season, .and Jim Lem
ery, G-G frosh center, also could
prove valuable.
Til 10 Cougars have adequate
size, shooting and experience;
they have been hurting defen
sively though.
Forwards Sells and Damon have
provided most of the scoring
punch thus far. Damon, G--4 20.1,
can play either in the front or
back court and last season was
the fourth best scorer on the var
sity. A fine floor man and a pow
erful rebounder he is looked to
when the going gets rough.
Sells at G-G averaged 12.4 points

per game last winter and grabbed
253 rebounds in 21 games.
from Seattle is G-2 and
a marvelous shooter. He set a
new WSU single game scoring
I record last winter with 37 points
1 in a game against Montana State
iat Bozeman. He is also a fine
floor general and leads the fast
break. He is probably the key
man in the Cougar atlaek.
