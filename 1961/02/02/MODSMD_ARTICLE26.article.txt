# House Presidents Probe Fundamental Standard
## 
### FRANCES FISHER 
Monday night 37 living group presidents met to discuss two ques
tions about the Fundamental Standard: what is it and is it necessary?
Fundamental Standard Commission Chairman Bob Linneman
opened the meeting by stating that "of course the Fundamental
Standard has faults, but the question we must discuss is: Is there

benefit to be derived from the
Standard?"
IN DISCUSSING how the
Standard can be defined, Linne
man stressed that it remains un
codified because its purpose is not
to lay down specific rules but to
help students to think for them
selves.
Linneman explained five areas
of the Fundamental Standard
which have been defined, pointing
out that these specifics do not
limit the Standard to those areas,
but only act as guides in particu
larly troublesome areas.
Those five areas fall under the
following headings:
1 • Academic: The honor code
defines the conduct expected in
the academic field.
2) Library: Students are ex
pected not to deface or steal li
brary materials or make them
unavailable to others.
31 Women's Social Regulations:
Women's Council defines this area
of conduct.
4. iDrama productions and pub
lications are expected to be in
good taste.
51 Liquor: Students are ex
pected to observe the University
ruling of no liquor on campus and
to act according to the "common
ethical code of educated persons."
ELUCIDATING on the liquor
clause of the Standard, Linneman
stated that the degree of drinking
and the common sense used are
the important elements in judging
complienco with the Fundamental
Standard,
During the discussion, a repre
sentative from Stern mentioned
the advantages of having judicial
councils within t he dorms, saying
that such councils seem to bring
the concept of the Fundamental
Standard nearer to the living
groups and therefore nearer to
individual students.
Eric Blitz, member of Men's
Council, commented that councils
within living groups tend to lack
the serious atmosphere which is
essential to a judicial council. He
stated that a general standard
cannot be applied when many
small councils exist.

out that these specifics do not
limit the Standard to those areas,
but only act as guides in particu
larly troublesome areas.
Those five areas fall under the
following headings:
1 • Academic: The honor code
defines the conduct expected in
the academic field.
2) Library: Students are ex
pected not to deface or steal li
brary materials or make them
unavailable to others.
31 Women's Social Regulations:
Women's Council defines this area
of conduct.
4. iDrama productions and pub
lications are expected to be in
good taste.
51 Liquor: Students are ex
pected to observe the University
ruling of no liquor on campus and
to act according to the "common
ethical code of educated persons."
ELUCIDATING on the liquor
clause of the Standard, Linneman
stated that the degree of drinking
and the common sense used are
the important elements in judging
complienco with the Fundamental
Standard,
During the discussion, a repre
sentative from Stern mentioned
the advantages of having judicial
councils within t he dorms, saying
that such councils seem to bring
the concept of the Fundamental
Standard nearer to the living
groups and therefore nearer to
individual students.
Eric Blitz, member of Men's
Council, commented that councils
within living groups tend to lack
the serious atmosphere which is
essential to a judicial council. He
stated that a general standard
cannot be applied when many
small councils exist.
