## 
### 
VIENTIANE, Laos (UPi)
Twin government columns sup
ported by rocket-firing planes
yesterday captured the important
road junction of Sala Phou Khoun
from the Communists.
The victory cleared the way for
a government assault on the
Plain of Jars and also opened the
highway between the administra
tive and royal capitals of Laos.
Sala Phou Khoun is 3.") miles
southeast of (he royal capital of
Luang Prabang and 100 miles
north of Vientiane. Road No. 7,
sometimes known as the Queen
Astrid Road, leads eastward from
there to the plain 50 miles away
where Soviet airlifts continue.
One governemnt column drove
north from Vientiane and the
other south from Luang Prabang.
They met at Sala Phou Khoun
yesterday but apparently failed
to trap the 1,000-man rebel force
there.
