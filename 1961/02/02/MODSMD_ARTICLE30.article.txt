# SIRO Collects Books For Chung Chi College
## 
### 
Over 700 textbooks collected by
SIRO from drives and donations
went to Chung Chi College in
Hong Kong last quarter. This
interdenominational College of

Liberal Arts and Sciences was 1
founded in 1951 to meet the edu
cational needs of Chinese refu
gees from the mainland.
Professor Shau Wing Chan,
Executive Head of the Depart
ment of Asian Languages, advised
lIR of the college's need for Eng
lish-language textbooks. Through
student drives and donations from
the University and other area
libraries, SIRO was able to send
over TOO volumes at the unvier
sity and secondary level, as well
as technical publications.

The Hong Kong government do
nated this site in 1953, when the
college found its original facilities
overtaxed by the heavy influx of
students.
After fund-raising, the buildings
and landscaping were finally com
pleted in 1958. The college will
be one of the components for a
Chinese university now being con- j
sidered for Hong Kong, Dr. Chan
pointed out.
Instruction is given in both Chi
nese (Canton and Kuo-yu i and j
English. Chung Chi is one of
many new schools recently estab
lished in Hong Kong to meet the
demand for Christian, Chinese
higher-education institutions in'
the Colong Area.
