CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla
( UPI i A new American in
tercontinental rocket, the
solid fueled Minuteman, was
placed on the firing line yes
terday without previous flight
tests and roared 4,200 miles
down the Atlantic test range
to find its target.
The Minuteman is a com
pact. highly mobile vehicle de
signed for fast firing from
railroad flat cars and under
ground silos. It can be pro
duced at relatively "budget"
prices.
Because it burns a solid
fuel it requires none of the
complicated plumbing and
g r o un d support equipment
needed to get liquid ICBM's
like Atlas and Titan off the
ground.
