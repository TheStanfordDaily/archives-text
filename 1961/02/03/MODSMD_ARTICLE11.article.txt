## Industrial Age Will Sabotage Marx Doctrine 
### NILS WESSELL 
Alexander Kerensky, pri m o
minister of Russia's Provisional
Government in 1917, declared last
night that the same technology
which created the industrial pro
letariat is now killing that class.
He cited automation as a pri
mary reason for the extinction
of the oppressed working class
which Marx believed would over
throw the bourgeoisie.
HE EMPHASIZED that, even
in the United States where capi
talism remains strong, labor
unions have gained political ascen
dancy. "Oftentimes, the AFL-CIO
is far more powerful, politically,
than the Association of American
Manufacturers," Kerensky re
marked.
Time and economic conditions,
he believes, have made Marx's
doctrine obsolete.
In the process of answering
various questions addressed to
him in the Rinconada lounge,
Kerensky defined his personal
credo in politics and philosophy.
"I believe in the autonomy of the
personality and the intangible
right of all men to live in a state
of political and religious free
dom.
"THE MARXISTS say that if a
man has a right to kill 100 million
animals, a man may exterminate
the whole bourgeois class for the
benefit of the proletariat. Marx
ists believe that they must do
away with the ideal of morality
since the bourgeoisie use it to
oppress the working class."
When asked about the failure of
the United States 1o support Hun
gary physically during its 1936
revolution, Kerensky commented
j that the Hungarians lost faith in
j the "sincerity" of the United
j States. Hungarians expected to
get from the United States more
powerful help than mere words.
