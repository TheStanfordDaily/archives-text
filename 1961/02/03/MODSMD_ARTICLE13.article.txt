A student asked me recently if T believed America could pos
sibly hope to defeat Communism without resorting to war. Her
reasoning was that the Communists are gaining day by day, thai
Americans seem unable to comprehend the imminent danger and
that before we know it, the Communists will have forced us into
a position of either dying for our freedom or of reconciling our
selves to slavery.
This student and many more like her are one step away from
giving up, the very attitude the Communists are trying to engen
der. Communism tries to destroy the will to oppose. Subjugation
is a simple matter when people feel there is no way to avoid it.
The sad part is that more and more American students are
finding more and more justification for their pessimism and fatal
ism. They read about a new Communist gain almost every day.
They also read about a U.S. diplomatic setback almost every day.
Why shouldn't they sink into cynicism and disgust?
There are at least two reasons. First of all, as mentioned above,
psychological surrender is just what the Communists want. Sec
ondly, the threat of Communism should act as a stimulant rather
than as a depressant. Our generation has a purpose —to defeat
(without recourse to atomic war) a movement antithetical to our
ideals. This does not mean that our purpose is negative, that our
only purpose is to destroy. On the contrary, the threat of subju
gation gives us the chance to re-examine our society. \\ by is it
that Communism is appealing to millions while democracy is not?
Js it not possible that we are no longer practicing the democracy
we preach?
We tell the world that wc stand for equality and liberty, and
yet we practice segregation. Most of the people in this world are
non-white. What do they think when we talk about equality and
liberty and then they observe the South?
We talk about freedom of inquiry and yet we have such a
body as the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which
crucifies anyone who dares to maintain a philosophy not identi
fied with their own.
The United States is still the greatest country in which to live,
but it is not as great as it could be. It contains some un-democratic
features and it is these on which the Communists capitalize. There
is no reason for the existence of these un-democratic features other
than the people don't seem to care enough to abolish them.
But "people"" means the generation before us. We are new
"people" and we can possess a new spirit. Even if Communism
never existed. v\e should understand our task. \\ e should make
America not the closest facsimile to true democracv, but true de
mocrats itself. If we clean up our own backyard, then I would
venture to say that Communism will wither on the \ine. But it is
going to take a herculean effort to clean up our own backyard.
There are [tiles of dirt and dead leaves lying all around and we
cannot see the rich topsoil beneath. Neither can the peoples of
the world.
This is my last editorial as editor of The Daily and 1 thought
1 could best utilize it if I spent a little time trying to sum up the
purpose of my editorial policy. As the leaders of tomorrow, it is
incumbent upon us to prove to the world that our system is fair
and just. But before we can prove it to the world we have to prove
it to ourselves. That is why I have stressed the importance of
thinking about-our society, of taking nothing for granted, of
opposing any concept or institution which you deem un-demo
cratic. The underdeveloped world has not \et turned its back on
us. It is up to our generation to make sure it does not.

ondly, the threat of Communism should act as a stimulant rather
than as a depressant. Our generation has a purpose —to defeat
(without recourse to atomic war) a movement antithetical to our
ideals. This does not mean that our purpose is negative, that our
only purpose is to destroy. On the contrary, the threat of subju
gation gives us the chance to re-examine our society. \\ by is it
that Communism is appealing to millions while democracy is not?

we preach?
We tell the world that wc stand for equality and liberty, and
yet we practice segregation. Most of the people in this world are
non-white. What do they think when we talk about equality and
liberty and then they observe the South?
We talk about freedom of inquiry and yet we have such a
body as the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which
crucifies anyone who dares to maintain a philosophy not identi

The United States is still the greatest country in which to live,
but it is not as great as it could be. It contains some un-democratic
features and it is these on which the Communists capitalize. There
is no reason for the existence of these un-democratic features other
than the people don't seem to care enough to abolish them.
But "people"" means the generation before us. We are new
"people" and we can possess a new spirit. Even if Communism
never existed. v\e should understand our task. \\ e should make
America not the closest facsimile to true democracv, but true de
mocrats itself. If we clean up our own backyard, then I would
venture to say that Communism will wither on the \ine. But it is
going to take a herculean effort to clean up our own backyard.
There are [tiles of dirt and dead leaves lying all around and we
cannot see the rich topsoil beneath. Neither can the peoples of

This is my last editorial as editor of The Daily and 1 thought
1 could best utilize it if I spent a little time trying to sum up the
purpose of my editorial policy. As the leaders of tomorrow, it is
incumbent upon us to prove to the world that our system is fair
and just. But before we can prove it to the world we have to prove
it to ourselves. That is why I have stressed the importance of
thinking about-our society, of taking nothing for granted, of
opposing any concept or institution which you deem un-demo
cratic. The underdeveloped world has not \et turned its back on
us. It is up to our generation to make sure it does not.

A student asked me recently if T believed America could pos
sibly hope to defeat Communism without resorting to war. Her
reasoning was that the Communists are gaining day by day, thai
Americans seem unable to comprehend the imminent danger and
that before we know it, the Communists will have forced us into
a position of either dying for our freedom or of reconciling our
selves to slavery.
This student and many more like her are one step away from
giving up, the very attitude the Communists are trying to engen
der. Communism tries to destroy the will to oppose. Subjugation
is a simple matter when people feel there is no way to avoid it.
The sad part is that more and more American students are
finding more and more justification for their pessimism and fatal
ism. They read about a new Communist gain almost every day.
They also read about a U.S. diplomatic setback almost every day.
Why shouldn't they sink into cynicism and disgust?
There are at least two reasons. First of all, as mentioned above,
psychological surrender is just what the Communists want. Sec
ondly, the threat of Communism should act as a stimulant rather
than as a depressant. Our generation has a purpose —to defeat
(without recourse to atomic war) a movement antithetical to our
ideals. This does not mean that our purpose is negative, that our
