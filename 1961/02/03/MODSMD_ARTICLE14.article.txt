HAS THE OLD ROY DIED?
Two worn-out old men, with a
total of seven "black cancelled
years" in the military service,
their youth shattered by "these
frustrating years," returned to
their beloved Farm, founded in a
fit of maternal overproteclion,
only to be "deprived of the girls
they love, material goods they
want, and stability they need."
Since our youth has been com
pletely wasted away, the only joy
in life left us, as our eyes fail
and our backs bend under piles of
problem sets and papers, was the
assurance of a humor-filled Chap
pie as we eagerly awaited its next
issue.
Now a vital question has en
tered our senile minds. Has the
Old Boy gone into Deepfreeze
with the eminent Dr. W. G.
Wonka?
WHERE IN HELL ARE THE
OLD PROFESSORS ?
Is this pseudo-clown, who pur
ports to solve the problem of mili
tary obligations, an example of
one "of the more energetic, intel
ligent, and therefore the more
valuable men of our society?"
(Barf, Monthly.)
We thought we were old—the
Old Boy must be dead. Anyone
who pays forty cents for the next
Chappie will have to be out of his
mind. AND THE SAD FEATURE
IS THAT IT WONT EVEN LINE
OUR GARBAGE CANS.
Two Unworthy grand masters
Peter Mellini
Gene Roger
Editor, the Daily:
In the recent controversy over
the Eichmann case the argument
has been mainly concerned with

the "legality" of Israel's moves
and with the "fairness" of an
Israeli trial. In my opinion the
main point of the case is being
lost in this discussion.
Every rational person must
grant that it is illegal for one na
tion to kidnap a citizen or resi
dent of another slate; likewise, it
is physically impossible to expect
Jews to give a vicious Nazi, guilty
of heinous crimes, a "fair" trial.
However: "laws should be made
to suit the majority of instances;
and they are not framed accord
ing to what may possibly happen
in an individual case." (St. Thomas
Aquinas, "Treatise on Law.") The
resulting responsibility of men in
reinterpreting and, in extreme
cases, in ignoring old laws lays
on human beings grave responsi
bilities. At time we must, use our
reason and our hearts rather than
the laws of our forefathers. Is a
starving man a criminal if he
steals a loaf of bread? Argentina
was actively sympathetic to Nazi
Germany. Can we rely on them
for justice to Nazis?
Eichmann's crimes were against
the Germans, against the Jews
AND against, humanity. Where
are we to find an "impartial"
judge? And even if there was
some non-human to whom we
could have recourse for a "fair"
trial: Eichmann has not denied
his actions; he has claimed that
he was forced into them. I sub
mit that all men are responsible
for their actions: we cannot lay
the burden on our parents or so
ciety or pressures from above,
but must realize that as rational
beings we are answerable for our
deeds.

the Eichmann case the argument
has been mainly concerned with

the "legality" of Israel's moves
and with the "fairness" of an
Israeli trial. In my opinion the
main point of the case is being
lost in this discussion.
Every rational person must
grant that it is illegal for one na
tion to kidnap a citizen or resi
dent of another slate; likewise, it
is physically impossible to expect
Jews to give a vicious Nazi, guilty
of heinous crimes, a "fair" trial.
However: "laws should be made
to suit the majority of instances;
and they are not framed accord
ing to what may possibly happen
in an individual case." (St. Thomas
Aquinas, "Treatise on Law.") The
resulting responsibility of men in
reinterpreting and, in extreme
cases, in ignoring old laws lays
on human beings grave responsi
bilities. At time we must, use our
reason and our hearts rather than
the laws of our forefathers. Is a
starving man a criminal if he
steals a loaf of bread? Argentina
was actively sympathetic to Nazi
Germany. Can we rely on them
for justice to Nazis?
Eichmann's crimes were against
the Germans, against the Jews
AND against, humanity. Where
are we to find an "impartial"
judge? And even if there was
some non-human to whom we
could have recourse for a "fair"
trial: Eichmann has not denied
his actions; he has claimed that
he was forced into them. I sub
mit that all men are responsible
for their actions: we cannot lay
the burden on our parents or so
ciety or pressures from above,
but must realize that as rational
beings we are answerable for our
deeds.

HAS THE OLD ROY DIED?
Two worn-out old men, with a
total of seven "black cancelled
years" in the military service,
their youth shattered by "these
frustrating years," returned to
their beloved Farm, founded in a
fit of maternal overproteclion,
only to be "deprived of the girls
they love, material goods they
want, and stability they need."
Since our youth has been com
pletely wasted away, the only joy
in life left us, as our eyes fail
and our backs bend under piles of
problem sets and papers, was the
assurance of a humor-filled Chap
pie as we eagerly awaited its next
issue.
Now a vital question has en
tered our senile minds. Has the
Old Boy gone into Deepfreeze
with the eminent Dr. W. G.
Wonka?
WHERE IN HELL ARE THE
OLD PROFESSORS ?
Is this pseudo-clown, who pur
ports to solve the problem of mili
tary obligations, an example of
one "of the more energetic, intel
ligent, and therefore the more
valuable men of our society?"
(Barf, Monthly.)
We thought we were old—the
Old Boy must be dead. Anyone
who pays forty cents for the next
Chappie will have to be out of his
mind. AND THE SAD FEATURE
IS THAT IT WONT EVEN LINE
OUR GARBAGE CANS.
