### PHILIP T. McLEAN Librarian 
(Editor's Note: This is the last
in st series of eight articles on the
Hoover Institution on War, Revo
lution, and Peace.)

The Hoover Tower, which
houses the Hoover Library was
completed in (he summer of 1941,
and was dedicated on June 21,
1941, as the culminating event in
Stanford's week-long 50th anni
versary celebration.
From its founding in 1919 until
the fall of 1911, the Library occu
pied one stack-floor of the Univer
sity Library, and the room now
used as the Engineering Library
Reading Room. During the spring
and summer of 1941 Hie Hoover
Library collections were moved to
the new building, and now occupy
the basement and ground floors of
the building and twelve stack
floors within the Tower.
The previous articles in this se
ries have described the character
and extent of the special area col
lections in the Hoover Institution.
For these areas, the Library has
directed its efforts toward acquir
ing and organizing many catego
ries of printed materials: Parlia
mentary records, official gazettes,
government departmental reports,
periodicals, newspapers, hooks,
pamphlets, broadsides and manu
scripts, almost all of which exist
in the indigenous languages of the
areas concerned.
The staff is composed of people
of various nationalities, since lin
guistic skills are essential in ac
quiring, organizing and servicing
such materials. For all processes
relating to Western language ma
terials, the Library's organization
is similar to that of a college or
university library, with an Ac
quisitions Department, a Catalog
ing Department, a Reference and
Circulation Department, and a
Serials Department.
The chief public areas of the
Library are the Public Catalog,
the Circulation Desk and the Ref
erence Room, all to the left of the
Tower Lobby. The basement area
beneath the Reference Room
houses the Library's newspaper
collection, with a special newspa
per Reading Room, where back
file and current newspaper titles
may be consulted.
The Public Catalog records all
books, pamphlets and most mono
graphic documents in Western
languages, with entries for au
thor, title and subjects of the
work. These catalogs are supple
mented by auxiliary catalogs in
the Reference Room in which the
Library's periodical, newspaper
and documentary collections are
recorded.
Within the Tower the four
lower stack floors house the West
ern language materials represent
ed in the Dictionary Catalog.
These materials constitute the col
lections most comomnly used, es
pecially by students and general
readers.
The fifth to the ninth stack
floors house collections of docu
ments, periodicals and organiza
tional publications in Western
languages, complementing the
cataloged collections. Because of
very limited access to the stack
areas by elevator, the Library's
stacks are not open to the public.

Materials desired by readers are
brought from the stack at four
intervals during the day: at 9 and
11 a.m., and at 1 and 3 p.m., and
held at the Circulation Desk until
requested by readers.
The Library's resources serve
a variety of users. They are the
basis of the wide variety of re
search projects conducted by the
Hoover Institution, as described
in earlier articles in this series.
The Library's resources have
; formed the basis for 2(5 volumes
published since 1936 in the "Hoo
ver Library I'iiblications" series.
All these volumes are docu-1
mented by the Library's holdings
or are translations of documents
within the Library. Certain of
these studies have been written
by members of the Stanford Uni-:
versify faculty. One of the earlier
publications is Professor David:
Harris' "Diplomatic History of the :
| Balkan Crises of 1875-1K78," while
I one of the most recent is "Soviet
! Russia and the East, 1920-1927; a
Documentary Survey," whose co
author is Professor Robert C.
North.
A documentary study on the
Tsarist era in Russian history,
published in 1939, lists J. E. Wal
lace Sterling as one of its joint
I editors. The Library holdings
have been widely used in the work
of the "Conflict Project," a study
sponsored by Stanford's Interna
tional Studies Committee, on the
nature of conflict in international;
relations.
The purpose of the Library has'
been to acquire and maintain out
standing; collections bearing' on
the history of the two world wars,
and the resulting' economic and
social problems of the twentieth
century. By utilization of' its re
sources, Stanford students and
faculty members, visiting stu
dents and scholars, and research
staffs can study the causes and
the character of today's political
tensions, and, it is to be hoped,
reach corrective and constructive
conclusions.

work. These catalogs are supple
mented by auxiliary catalogs in
the Reference Room in which the
Library's periodical, newspaper
and documentary collections are
recorded.
Within the Tower the four
lower stack floors house the West
ern language materials represent
ed in the Dictionary Catalog.
These materials constitute the col

pecially by students and general
readers.
The fifth to the ninth stack
floors house collections of docu

languages, complementing the
cataloged collections. Because of
very limited access to the stack
areas by elevator, the Library's
stacks are not open to the public.

Materials desired by readers are
brought from the stack at four
intervals during the day: at 9 and
11 a.m., and at 1 and 3 p.m., and
held at the Circulation Desk until
requested by readers.
The Library's resources serve
a variety of users. They are the

published since 1936 in the "Hoo

All these volumes are docu-1
mented by the Library's holdings
or are translations of documents
within the Library. Certain of
these studies have been written
by members of the Stanford Uni-:

publications is Professor David:
Harris' "Diplomatic History of the :

A documentary study on the
Tsarist era in Russian history,
published in 1939, lists J. E. Wal

The Hoover Tower, which
houses the Hoover Library was
completed in (he summer of 1941,
and was dedicated on June 21,

From its founding in 1919 until

pied one stack-floor of the Univer

in the indigenous languages of the
areas concerned.
The staff is composed of people
of various nationalities, since lin
guistic skills are essential in ac

such materials. For all processes
relating to Western language ma

is similar to that of a college or

The purpose of the Library has'
been to acquire and maintain out
standing; collections bearing' on

The Hoover Tower, which
houses the Hoover Library was
completed in (he summer of 1941,
and was dedicated on June 21,
1941, as the culminating event in
Stanford's week-long 50th anni
versary celebration.
From its founding in 1919 until
the fall of 1911, the Library occu
pied one stack-floor of the Univer
sity Library, and the room now
used as the Engineering Library
Reading Room. During the spring
and summer of 1941 Hie Hoover
Library collections were moved to
the new building, and now occupy
the basement and ground floors of
the building and twelve stack
floors within the Tower.
The previous articles in this se
ries have described the character
and extent of the special area col
lections in the Hoover Institution.
For these areas, the Library has
directed its efforts toward acquir
ing and organizing many catego
ries of printed materials: Parlia
mentary records, official gazettes,
government departmental reports,
periodicals, newspapers, hooks,
pamphlets, broadsides and manu
scripts, almost all of which exist
in the indigenous languages of the
areas concerned.
The staff is composed of people
of various nationalities, since lin
guistic skills are essential in ac
quiring, organizing and servicing
such materials. For all processes
relating to Western language ma
terials, the Library's organization
is similar to that of a college or
university library, with an Ac
quisitions Department, a Catalog
ing Department, a Reference and
Circulation Department, and a
Serials Department.
The chief public areas of the
Library are the Public Catalog,
the Circulation Desk and the Ref
erence Room, all to the left of the
Tower Lobby. The basement area
beneath the Reference Room
houses the Library's newspaper
collection, with a special newspa
per Reading Room, where back
file and current newspaper titles
may be consulted.
The Public Catalog records all
books, pamphlets and most mono
graphic documents in Western
languages, with entries for au
thor, title and subjects of the
work. These catalogs are supple
mented by auxiliary catalogs in
the Reference Room in which the
Library's periodical, newspaper
and documentary collections are
recorded.
Within the Tower the four
lower stack floors house the West
ern language materials represent
ed in the Dictionary Catalog.
These materials constitute the col
lections most comomnly used, es
pecially by students and general
readers.
The fifth to the ninth stack
floors house collections of docu
ments, periodicals and organiza
tional publications in Western
languages, complementing the
cataloged collections. Because of
very limited access to the stack
areas by elevator, the Library's
stacks are not open to the public.

Materials desired by readers are
brought from the stack at four
intervals during the day: at 9 and
11 a.m., and at 1 and 3 p.m., and
held at the Circulation Desk until
requested by readers.
The Library's resources serve
a variety of users. They are the
basis of the wide variety of re
search projects conducted by the
Hoover Institution, as described
in earlier articles in this series.
The Library's resources have
; formed the basis for 2(5 volumes
published since 1936 in the "Hoo
ver Library I'iiblications" series.
All these volumes are docu-1
mented by the Library's holdings
or are translations of documents
within the Library. Certain of
these studies have been written
by members of the Stanford Uni-:
versify faculty. One of the earlier
publications is Professor David:
Harris' "Diplomatic History of the :
| Balkan Crises of 1875-1K78," while
I one of the most recent is "Soviet
! Russia and the East, 1920-1927; a
Documentary Survey," whose co
author is Professor Robert C.
North.
A documentary study on the
Tsarist era in Russian history,
published in 1939, lists J. E. Wal
lace Sterling as one of its joint
I editors. The Library holdings
have been widely used in the work
of the "Conflict Project," a study
sponsored by Stanford's Interna
tional Studies Committee, on the
nature of conflict in international;
relations.
