Kill tor, the Daily:
Mi-. Sherman's comments on
the Chaparral reveal a common
delusion about Ihat magazine:
that sometime in the dear dead
past, probably JUST the year be
fore you were freshmen, the
Chappie was tremendously and
invariably funny.
A glance through the files will
reveal the sad truth—Chaparral
has had lean years and fat years,
but SELDOM more than two good
issues in any one year. And these
are usually the last two, The Par
ody and Crash Comics.
Objectively, this year's maga
zine rates near the top in make
up. photography, art-work and en
joyable advertising (please note,
I'm NOT the Old Boy). If, in
spite of all this, you feel the Chap
pies are batting zero for four in
the humor department, well, re
member, the football team. The
boys deserve at least a little more
rope.
It seems safe to assume that
there has ALWAYS been a Chap
arral "In-Group." Maybe 1 his
year's in-group is less funny than
its predecessors, in which case
those of us who have tried turn
ing baser metals into gold extend
our sympathies to the Editor. I
personally plan to continue ex
tending 40 cents an issue, just to
be on the safe side.

Editor, the Daily:
We dislike seeing campus archi
tecture defaced and our honor as
Stanford students insulted each
time we pass the Stanford Book
store. The policy of requiring stu
dents to leave their belongings on
unguarded and unsightly shelves
before passing through the moni

tored porlals of a store which
their purchases helped to finance
is inconsistent both with the prin-,
ciples of the honor code and the
philosophy of the bookstore.
Such a procedure would be un
acceptable in any permissive kin
| dergarten. Any store in Palo Alto,
lacking a comparable monopoly of
a consumer population, would
promptly go out of business if
they instituted such a policy.
The admonishments w hi c h
greet each student as he enters do
more to undermine respect for
Ihe honor code than a dozen stu
dents cheating on examinations.
The crudely lettered signs and
littered shelves are a disgrace.
Coming next; a ten-foot high
banner across the handsome
facade of the library, hastily let
tered with phosphorescent paint
on a piece of used canvas, admon
ishing all students to please leave
their books neatly stacked on the

front steps so that the librarian:
may more readily catch prosper
t tive young thieves.

Mi-. Sherman's comments on
the Chaparral reveal a common
delusion about Ihat magazine:
that sometime in the dear dead
past, probably JUST the year be
fore you were freshmen, the
Chappie was tremendously and
invariably funny.
A glance through the files will
reveal the sad truth—Chaparral
has had lean years and fat years,
but SELDOM more than two good
issues in any one year. And these
are usually the last two, The Par
ody and Crash Comics.
Objectively, this year's maga
zine rates near the top in make
up. photography, art-work and en
joyable advertising (please note,
I'm NOT the Old Boy). If, in
spite of all this, you feel the Chap
pies are batting zero for four in
the humor department, well, re
member, the football team. The
boys deserve at least a little more
rope.
It seems safe to assume that
there has ALWAYS been a Chap
arral "In-Group." Maybe 1 his
year's in-group is less funny than
its predecessors, in which case
those of us who have tried turn
ing baser metals into gold extend
our sympathies to the Editor. I
personally plan to continue ex
tending 40 cents an issue, just to
be on the safe side.

We dislike seeing campus archi
tecture defaced and our honor as
Stanford students insulted each
time we pass the Stanford Book
store. The policy of requiring stu
dents to leave their belongings on
unguarded and unsightly shelves
before passing through the moni

tored porlals of a store which
their purchases helped to finance
is inconsistent both with the prin-,
ciples of the honor code and the
philosophy of the bookstore.
Such a procedure would be un
acceptable in any permissive kin
