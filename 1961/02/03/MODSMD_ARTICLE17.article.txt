# WEEKEND HOOP
## Cards Bill Huskies, Cougars Daily Sports 
### 
If past records are any indica
tion, tonight's AAWU basketball
game between Stanford and Uni
versity of Washington on the
Huskies' home court should be a
real cliff-hanger.
TONIGHT'S fray marks the
third meeting of the two rivals
and the fourth league game for
the Cards. In their two previous
meetings the northlanders and

the Indians played on even terms;
Stanford won the first, taking a
61-58 decision in overtime, and
then Washington squeaked out
the second, 51-49.
Coach Howie Dallmar's crew
holds a two-win and one-loss rec
ord in Big Five action, good for
runnerup spot behind USC's per
fect four-win, no-loss mark. The
Cards will need a win over the
Huskies to remain in the race.
Top scorer for the host Seattle
five is Bill Hanson who hit for
29 points in the first Indian-Hus
kie encounter. Sophomore Ed Cor
ell twined 15 in the second game
to lead the winning attack and
he is currently the league's sec
ond best rebounder. Senior guard
Clint Names is second high point
maker for Washington and he
also provides dependable back
court leadership.
FOR Stanford forward John
Windsor has a scoring average
of over 14 counters per game
while seniors John Hendry and
Bub Bowling have both hit for
about nine points per outing.
Do n Clemetson, sophomore
guard, and Mike Ledgerwood, 6-7
junior center, round out the start
ing lineup along with Windsor,
Hendry and Bowl in g. Darrell
Sutherland, Phil Kelly, Rich Hos
ley and Doug Clemetson provide
the bench strength.
Tomorrow night the Indian
quint travels to Pullman for a
single game against tho Washing
ton State Cougars and this one
could be a carbon copy of the
Seattle action. Stanford has
played WSU once previously this
season and the Cougars barely
pulled it out, 51-50.
CHARLIE SELLS, 6-6 junior
foi'w a r d, leads the Pullman
squad's front line in both re
bounding and scoring. Top back
court man on Coach Marv Harsh
man's contingent is Terry Ball, a
6-2 guard and a big scoring
threat.
