# ROMANTIC DIVERSIONS
## Players to Open Jean Anouilh's Waltz of the Toreadors Tonight 
### 
A romantic general, whose one
memorable experience is falling
in love with a girl at a ball, will
be diverted, dismayed and sub
dued tonight in Memorial Audi
torium when the Stanford Play
ers open their production of Jean
Anouilh's comedy, "The Waltz of
the Toreadors."
The general's diversions come
in the forms of several pretty
maids and a dressmaker, in addi
tion to his first love who appears
unexpectedly.
THE SITUATION is further
complicated by his wife, who
feigns illness in order to hold her
husband, and his good friend and
doctor whose long consultations
with the general's wife prove to
be more than medical in scope.
Taking the role of General St.
Pe will be Richard Risso. Risso's
theatrical background includes
both directing and acting with
the Oregon Shakespearean Festi
val for which he directed "Rich
aid II" and played the title role
in "Julius Caesar" last year.
His shrewish but lovely wife
will be played by Lisa Lauterer,
a graduate student in the Drama
Department, who has appeared in
many recent Stanford Players'
productions.
THE PART of Mile, de St. Eu
verte, the general's first love, will
be taken by Margaret Landry.
Now a director at the Los Altos
Creative Workshop, Miss Landry
received the Best Actress Award
at the University of California at
Santa Barbara in 1946 and 1948.
Gaston, the general's priggish
young secretary who wakes up to
the pleasures of love in the last
act of the play, will be played by
Douglass Johnson. A Stanford
senior, Johnson recently had lead
ing roles in the Stanford Players'
"Much Ado About Nothing" last
quarter and Ram's Head's "Kis
met" last year.

Steven Gilborn, who was seen
in the Players' production of "A
Touch of the Poet" last Novem
ber, is cast as Dr. Bonfant.
THE GENERAL'S two. very
plain, boring daughters will be
played by Jean Guthrie and Mar
garet Covvles. Pauline Peotter
will appear as the dressmaker
Mme. Dupont-Fredaine. Others
in the cast are Michael Ambrose,
Jan Howells and Georgia Ryther.
Directing the play is Dr. Robert
Loper who recently returned to
Stanford after spending a year
directing and doing research in
England, Canada and Oregon.
Last summer he directed "The

Taming of the Shrew" at the Ore
gon Shakespearean Festival and,
last fall, the San Francisco Ac
tor's Workshop presentation of
"The Alchemist," which is still
playing in the city.
SET IN France at the begin
ning of this century, "Waltz" is
being costumed by Irene Griffin,
with stage settings by Richard
Hay and lighting by Paul Landry.
The play will continue Saturday
night and Friday and Saturday of
next week; curtain time is 8:30
p.m. Tickets for the production
are priced at $1.25, $1.50, $2 and
$2.50, on sale at the Memorial Au
