victory over the San Jose Rugbv

Club, and a narrow 6-3 squeaker
over the Olympic Club for a throe
win and no-loss mark.
Card coach Pete Kmetovic ex
pressed the opinion that the Tribe
has looked very sharp in their
workouts and should have little
1 rouble with the Ramblers if they
don't pet cocky and overconfident.
All the Indians are healthy with
the exception of Jack McCul
lough, who caught a cleat in his
head in a practice workout, but
lie is expected to be okay for the
Rambler tilt.
The Tribe ruggers will be con
siderably strengthened by the
addition of Mac Wylie and Jim
Epstein. Both have been working
out regularly and should soon be
ready for extensive duty.
