# Pooh Gives New Hope
## 
### 
Contributing to the current
Pooh renaissance in the U.S., sev
eral Stanford students have re
cently formed the Pooh Society.
Its charter meeting will be held
today at an undisclosed off cam
pus residence.
William June, one of the found
ers. stated that "many students
find, after having taken History
10. 11 and 12. that Thomism offers
little comfort, or that Calvinism
is basically immoral. They turn,
then, to the literature of Antoine
St. Exupery or to Peanuts to find
solace.
"The Pooh Society feels," he
said, "that in the works of our be
loved A.A.. Milne an optimistic an
swer may be found to the absurd
ity of life."
The Pooh Society will be dedi
cated to finding that answer.
Readings will be given from the
Collected Works. Students will
engage in research for the pur
poses of close analysis, criticism,
and explication of obscure refer
ences. Professors will be invited
to lecture on Pooh.
Both the wisdom and enjoy
ment inherent in Pooh will be
emphasized through the singing
of Pooh songs and through color
ing book â€¢sessions.
Pro tern officers of the Pooh
Society are J. Todd Stewart,
Christopher Robin; Barry Green
berg, Perpetual Heffalump; Paula
Rinta, Piglet; Stephen Freidberg,
Eeyore; Pal Falk, Trigger; and
Joel Meister, Pooh Bear.
