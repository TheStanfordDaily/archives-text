# Legislature Debates Election Alterations
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Associate Editor 
Legislature last night took under consideration and partially ap
proved a number of important changes in ASSU election procedure.
Most important of the recommended alterations was the proposal
to seat a representative of the campus' 2,296 married students on
LASSU. as a regular elected member. No action was taken however,

that resolution being sent back to
the Traditions and Services Com
mittee, from which it came, for
further study.
THE RESOLUTION called for
the student to be a resident of
Escondido Village.
Another change submitted, but
returned to TS, was a proposal
"that there continue to be two
representatives from the School
of Humanities and Sciences (on
LASSU), but that one . . . be ma
joring in one of the sciences and
the other be majoring in one of
the humanities." The two repre
sentatives in the past have been
largely from the sciences.
This resolution would, as sub
mitted, require a by-laws change
in the ASSU constitution, and the
one proposing a married rep
would require a student body
vote, since it would require a con
stitutional change.
LASSU ALSO passed a resolu
tion which set up additional poll
ing places at Encina and the
Physics Tank; set aside an issue
of The Daily for campaign pub
licity; informing the students
ASSU offices through circulars;
called for small rallies in living
groups.
Legislature, which had to strug
gle for 15 minutes to got enough
regular and substitute members
for a quorum, also adopted a reso
lution noting "that there will be
no electioneering in classrooms
and lecture halls."
The group also became involved
in a debate on raising the flick
price this Sunday to 40 cents, with
the 20-cent hike going to the
Winter Drive. It did, however, ap
prove the boost.
