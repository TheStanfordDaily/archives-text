# Goldwater Says U.S. Must Stress Power
## 
### ROSS HERMANN 
United States foreign policy must be based on power and its proper application, said Senator Barry
Goldwater, speaking to a capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium yesterday.
The senator, the acknowledged leader of political conservatism, said that throughout history the
country that has dominated the popular means of transportation has been the world power. Me cited
England and its mastery of the sea as an example.
The United States, he said, is now master of the air and can use this power to preserve the peace.

"In order to preserve the peace I
we must preserve our power."
Therefore, he concluded, a policy
of disarmament would be disas
trous to the nation.
He said that a policy of power
might mean going to the brink of
war and returning, as former See-!
retary of State John Foster Dulles
advocated. But he felt tlie results
would be peace in which Russia, I
pushed to ihe wall, would back j
down. He also proposed that this
country expand U-2 operations
into a constant world surveillance.'
THE SENATOR said that such
a policy could have prevented j
World War II if this country had J
possessed the power at the time.
Goldwater's foreign policy
statements, which were inter- !
rupted by cheers from the audi
ence, came as part of a general '
discussion of political conserva- i
tism.
He said that the liberalism of J
today which favors centralized!
federal government is not the tra- !
flit ional liberalism but rather is
reactionary and radical. He pre-1
dieted that the modern conserva
tives will be recorded in history j
in the face of threats from big
government.
He said, however, that the un- i
fortunate thing about the con- j
servatives is that during the last j
30 years they have failed to artic- j
ulate their position and have been
backed into a situation where
they have been associated with
the status quo and obstructionism.
THE BASIC, tenet of conserva
tism, he said, is based upon the j
known values of history, among !
them individual freedom and hu- j
man dignity.
Discussing his approach to edu
cation, Goldwater said that the!
nation needs not greater volume
but greater quality. He proposed
increased income tax deductions
to allow more money to be spent
by the individual and by local gov
ernment agencies. He said that
federal education is unconstitu
tional because the states have
never ceded their authority, which j
is guaranteed in the Constitution.!
Asked about the United Na-j
tions, Goldwater said he would j
favor United States withdrawal
from that body if Communist
China is admitted. Ho did not
think, however, that live entry of,
Red China is likely. In line with
this thinking, he said that recog
nition should be withdrawn from j
all Communist nations, including j
Russia. This would have the ef- j
feet, he felt, of giving confidence
to the wobbling countries of the 1
world.
IN RESPONSE to another ques-;
tion, Goldwater defended the
House Un-American Activities!
Committee as being necessary in
keeping Congress and the people
well informed concerning the ac
tivities of Communists in this I
country.
Asked how to cut down on gov
ernment spending without hamp
ering defense efforts, Goldwater;
said that the agricultural supports j
program should be discontinued
and that large reductions could
be made in certain areas of vet
erans payments.
In concluding his remarks,
Goldwater said that freedom j
comes from God, not government,
and that the sole purpose of the |
state is the protection of personal
liberties.

Goldwater said that freedom j
comes from God, not government,
and that the sole purpose of the |
state is the protection of personal
liberties.
United States foreign policy must be based on power and its proper application, said Senator Barry
Goldwater, speaking to a capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium yesterday.
The senator, the acknowledged leader of political conservatism, said that throughout history the
country that has dominated the popular means of transportation has been the world power. Me cited
England and its mastery of the sea as an example.
The United States, he said, is now master of the air and can use this power to preserve the peace.

"In order to preserve the peace I
we must preserve our power."
Therefore, he concluded, a policy
of disarmament would be disas
trous to the nation.
He said that a policy of power
might mean going to the brink of
war and returning, as former See-!
retary of State John Foster Dulles
advocated. But he felt tlie results
would be peace in which Russia, I
pushed to ihe wall, would back j
down. He also proposed that this
country expand U-2 operations
into a constant world surveillance.'
THE SENATOR said that such
a policy could have prevented j
World War II if this country had J
possessed the power at the time.
Goldwater's foreign policy
statements, which were inter- !
rupted by cheers from the audi
ence, came as part of a general '
discussion of political conserva- i
tism.
He said that the liberalism of J
today which favors centralized!
federal government is not the tra- !
flit ional liberalism but rather is
reactionary and radical. He pre-1
dieted that the modern conserva
tives will be recorded in history j
in the face of threats from big
government.
He said, however, that the un- i
fortunate thing about the con- j
servatives is that during the last j
30 years they have failed to artic- j
ulate their position and have been
backed into a situation where
they have been associated with
the status quo and obstructionism.
THE BASIC, tenet of conserva
tism, he said, is based upon the j
known values of history, among !
them individual freedom and hu- j
man dignity.
Discussing his approach to edu
cation, Goldwater said that the!
nation needs not greater volume
but greater quality. He proposed
increased income tax deductions
to allow more money to be spent
by the individual and by local gov
ernment agencies. He said that
federal education is unconstitu
tional because the states have
never ceded their authority, which j
is guaranteed in the Constitution.!
Asked about the United Na-j
tions, Goldwater said he would j
favor United States withdrawal
from that body if Communist
China is admitted. Ho did not
think, however, that live entry of,
Red China is likely. In line with
this thinking, he said that recog
nition should be withdrawn from j
all Communist nations, including j
Russia. This would have the ef- j
feet, he felt, of giving confidence
to the wobbling countries of the 1
world.
IN RESPONSE to another ques-;
tion, Goldwater defended the
House Un-American Activities!
Committee as being necessary in
keeping Congress and the people
well informed concerning the ac
tivities of Communists in this I
country.
Asked how to cut down on gov
ernment spending without hamp
ering defense efforts, Goldwater;
said that the agricultural supports j
program should be discontinued
and that large reductions could
be made in certain areas of vet
erans payments.
In concluding his remarks,
Goldwater said that freedom j
comes from God, not government,
