# SANTA MARIA
## Floating Revolution' Over; Passengers OK 
### 
RECIFE, Bra/.il (UPIt Portuguese rebel leader Henrique Galvao
yesterday put ashore the eaptive passengers and crew of the liner
Santa Maria following a night of mutiny, riot and bloodshed and
prepared to surrender the ship in the collapse of his 12-day floating
revolution.
Naval •sources said the ship would be returned to its owners tomor-

row and Galvao would be granted
political asylum in Brazil.
Galvao told a shipboard news
conference that the ship is in the
hands of Brazilian authorities and
cannot leave port. He said even if
it were free to go he could 7iot sail
it away because only four of his
rebel crew know anything about
navigation.
REPRESENTATIVES of the
Portuguese shipping firm which
owns the $16.6 million vessel re
ported even the ship's captain,
Mario Sinoes Maia, had left—
technically the last man of the
crew to quit the vessel—leaving
only Galvao, his men and 50 Bra
zilian marines aboard.
The reliever ship owners said
they would honor the 620 passen
gers' tickets, taking Portuguese
and Spaniards home by ship, with
plane or ship accomdations to
Miami to be provided for the 42
American passengers.
IT HAD started in a burst of
gunfire off the Spanish Main Jan.
22. It ended in melodrama, with
fighting on the ship, men jump
ing overboard, crowds cheering
in the streets, and gall and worm
wood for 66-year-old Galvao, wear
ing epaulets of black and gold
on his shirt and, according to pas
sengers, marks of black and blue
on his skin.
HE HAD failed to topple the
strongman Portuguese govern
ment of Premier Antonio dc Oli
veira Salazar.
Brazilian Admiral Dias Fernan
dez told Rear Adm. Allen Smith
Jr. of the U.S. Navy ,that he
hoped Galvao formally would
turn over control of the Santa
Maria to him by 11 a.m. today.
The end of the one of the
strangest voyages in navigation
history came soon after the crew
turned on Galvao during the night
as the ship stood at anchor off
shore. In the melee the rebel chief
was reported hurled through a
window.
