# JFK Tells Economic Program
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI > — Presi
dent Kennedy yesterday pre
sented to Congress a sweeping
list of employment, housing and
monetary programs designed to
restore "vigor and vitality" to
the American economy.
If they do not produce the de
sired results in the first quarter
of the year, he said, "I shall sub
mit further proposals to the Con
gress within the next 75 days.
"THE NATION cannot— and
will not —be satisfied with eco
nomic decline and slack," he said
in his first economic message to
the 87th Congress and the nation.
Kennedy called for immediate
action to aid distressed areas, in
crease and expand the minimum
wage, temporarily extend unem
ployment compensation, step up
distribution of food to the needy,
and make money for housing and
urban renewal more readily avail
able.
He also asked for improvements
in the old-age survivors and disa
bility insurance program and for
the award of more defense con
tracts in sections with big labor
surpluses.
At a briefing on the report, a
White House adviser said the cost
of Kennedy's proposed new pro
grams had not been carefully esti
mated, but that the total figure
"certainly would be under $5 bil
lion."
"REALISTIC aims for 1961 are
to reverse the downtrend in our
economy." he said, "to narrow
the gap of unused potential, to
abate the waste and misery of
unemployment, and at the same
time to maintain reasonable sta
bility of the price level.
"For 1962 and 1963 our pro
grams must aim at expanding
American productive capacity at
a rate that shows the world the
vigor and vitality of a free
economy.
Kennedy said, as he did in his
State of (he Union message, that
the programs he proposes will not
in themselves lead to an unbal
anced budget. Neither will his ad
ministration contribute to infla
tion, he added, but it will use the
"powerful tools of fiscal and
monetary policy" to halt any spon
taneous trend in that direction.
CITING A serious increase in
unemployment since early last
summer, the President asked Con
gress to temporarily extend the
duration of the jobless benefits
to nn overall federal-state maxi
mum of 39 weeks. Where states |
already provide benefits beyond |
ihe current period of 26 weeks, j
he said, the federal money would
free state funds to increase the
amounts of such benefits.
Kennedy also urged reforms in
the permanent federal-state unem
ployment insurance program. He j
said detailed recommendations
along this line will be submitted!
to Congress by the end c»l March.
