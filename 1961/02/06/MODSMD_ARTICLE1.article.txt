from four to six lanes after the
State Division of Highways
awards bids in March, University
officials have announced.
Stanford's iamous "mile of
roses" growing on a wire fence
along the highway between Palm
Drive and Stanford Avenue will
bo moved back to allow for the
addition of one traffic lane and
one parking lane.
THE widening will be on a 2.7-
mile section of El Camino from
University to Matadero Avenues
in Palo Alto. Two miles of the
strip along the west side of the
highway, totaling 4.8 acres, will
be purchased from Stanford.
Stanford will pay its share of
the costs of curbs, gutters, drains
and street lights necessary where
they arc not already installed
along University frontage.
The Shell service station at
Galvez and El Camino near the
Stadium, a landmark for nearly
30 years, will be permanently re
moved.
Under the state's master plan
El Camino Real will become 104
feet wide with a 16-foot divider
strip to be landscaped and lighted
by the City of Palo Alto.
BREAKS IN the curb and the
divider will align with gates in
the Stanford fence to allow for
expediting of football parking
traffic.
Alongside the widened highway
the wire fence on which the "mile
of roses" climbs will be relocated,
but the roses themselves may not
be replanted. Instead they may be
replaced with climbing vines or
some other form of landscaping.
The present "mile" of roses ac
tually extends for a mile and a
quarter and contains Paul Scarlet
roses planted in 1947 for decora
tion.
The state has allocated $850,000
in its 1961-62 highways budget to
finance the El Camino Real proj
ect. The work is due to be com
pleted before the onset of the
1961-62 rainy season.
