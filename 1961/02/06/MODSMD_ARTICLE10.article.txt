# Segregation Ends at Miami U.
## 
### 
CORAL GABLES, Fla. (UPD - No Ne
groes are wailing today to storm the doors
of the University of Miami, which h;is opened
its enrollment books to all qualified students
"regardless of race, creed or color."
For one thing, it costs $450 a semester to
attend Miami, largest private university in
,the Southeast. And registration for the cur
rent term's second semester, which starts
today, is just about complete, officials said.
TIIK UNANIMOUS integration vote of
the university board of trustees last Tuesday
caught everyone by surprise. Attending the
closed meeting were 25 of the 33 board mem
bers who hold votes.
Observers said there was little discussion,
that the board apparently felt "such action
was inevitable and just decided to do it now."
The University Hurricane, student news
paper, took a poll of students last semester
and advocated integration.
BUT KO.'Mtl) members apparently had
more hard reasons than student sentiment
for the move. Miami for years has been at
tempting to build a reputation as ihc "uni
versity of the Americas" and the fact that it
now will admit any qualified stu lent regard

less of color should strengthen ihe school's
appeal to Latin Americans who frown on
Dixie's segregation customs.
University trustees are noted for looking
at school needs in terms of money. A Miami
banker offered the integration resolution and
it was apparent the university has its eye on
federal grants.
Miami, despite its enrollment of nearly
10.000 students a year, has had its financial
troubles like many other universities in the
past few years.
"TIIKKK HAVIO been indications from
Washington that the new administration may
open up with more funds for higher educa
tion. but possibly with strings against segre
gation attached," a university spokesman ob
served.
Athletic Director Jack Harding said he
first heard the university had been integrated
when he saw a newspaper report, and had
m;ide no plans concerning Negro athletes.
Football Coach Andy Gustafson also was
sin prised.
"M\ recruiting for next fall has been com
pleted," <aid (iiistafson, "hut I sure wouldn't
turn down a chance to talk with at) Larnie

Davis."
DAVIS, A NKGKO, was an All-American
halfback at Syracuse University last fall.
University officials fell that the first
Negro students probably would register for
the summer session and most likely
would be such students as teachers seeking
to add to their education in the graduate
school. Such Negro students have attended
summer graduate school sessions before at
Miami.
The undergraduate students on campus
were surprised by the trustees' action, too,
but reaction was mild.
"People are people no matter what their
color," said George Gill. 2(3. a freshman.
"IT DOKSN'T bother me," said Patricia
Manion. 17. a freshman.
"I think it's the right thing, actually," said
Frank Lloyd. 23. a senior. "It's smart of the
University of Miami to get the jump on other
schools i?i the South."
"It's wonderful," said Ellen Blumin. 18. a
freshman. "It shows we're progressing."
"I think it was Inevitable." said Susan
Nettman. a freshman. "Whether students like
ii or not 1 think isn't a serious question."
