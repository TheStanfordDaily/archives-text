# Liberty, Not Technology Provides Main Defense
## 
### 
As we enter the second month of the Kennedy administration
it will be well for all of us to etch in our memories the words of
Abraham Lincoln: "Our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty
as the heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere." Not all our
accelerated research, not all our expenditures on missiles and satel-1
lites can make our defenses more than a brute struggle for survival
unless we simultaneously preserve the spirit of freedom.
We cannot buy or defend with money the essence of Western
civilization, nor can we induce men, by money alone, to give their
best for its preservation. No crash program can produce a lefferson,
a Lincoln, an Einstein.
Whatever Russia may claim to have, she does not claim to fur
nish the necessary atmosphere for freedom. Yet, Russia has achieved
since the end of World War 11, results which are leading to a drastic
re-evaluation of United States policy.
Perhaps this paradox is caused by the fact that the Russians ;
and their imported scientists have not created new basic ideas but
have built on old ones. The qualities that produce changes in human
life are not carried on in slavery. No doubt, the Soviets will send
a man into space. They have the technique and the technicians to
do such things and so do we. But it is doubtful that totalitarianism
will ever produce another humanist like Tolstoy.
To preserve the fertile atmosphere, liberty, citizens in the free
world must guard against the gradual exchange of freedom for
greater security.
Many of us who have had jobs have lost the freedom of spend
ing our entire income—the income tax has taken care of that. We
men have lost the freedom of deciding what to do with some years
of our lives—the draft has taken care of that. Many of the future
businessmen and scientists studying at this University may lose
the freedom to appreciate the beauties of nature, to learn, and to 1
understand mankind, because they must develop the tools of war. !
Our society is not as free as it was a half century ago.
Nevertheless, our essential freedom gives us an advantage over
every dictatorship. It may be difficult to visualize freedom when,
like the atmosphere, it is all around us. It is indeed a treasure noted
in its absence. But it will be well for all of us in the coming months
to reflect on our freedom and resolve not to be deceived by those
who say we cannot be free and still defend ourselves.
For the opposite is true: our defense will always be weakened
by any encroachments on those basic liberties which make our '
way unique.
