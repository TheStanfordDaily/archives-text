## President Now Controls American Political Center 
### 
When we tr*' to read the mean
ing of the vote about enlarging
the Committee on Rules of the
House, we must bear in mind that
it took place at the very begin
ning of the Kennedy administra
tion. The Kennedy program on
which the House will have to act
has not yet been published, in
deed a great deal of it has not
yet been worked out in legislative
form. All that was before the
House was the Democratic plat
form, campaign speeches of both
parties, the inaugural address,
and Last Monday's message. These
are general statements of purpose
and policy but they do not con
tain specifications about the laws
that will be asked for or the
money that will be needed. The

task force re
ports, while they
provide insight
into the thinking
of Kennedy's ad
visors, are not
Administra
tion legislative
proposals.
Thus, the ac
tion in the House
was a reflection
of what has gone

before. The vote was close as the
election was close. This vote does
not necessarily, or even probably,
anticipate the future which is
likely to be very different when
President Kennedy has begun to
act, and 1o make decisions, and
to propose not merely policies but
programs and measures. Presum
ably when he is being the leader
and not merely talking about
leadership, he will continue to
grow stronger. Indeed he is al
ready considerably stronger in his
popular support thai he was on
election day.
ONE CAN, therefore, easily ex
aggerate the significance of the
vote. There is. however, no doubt
of its practical importance. In ef
fect, the House transferred to
Speaker Rayburn from Rep. How
ard W. Smith the power to deter
mint what shall be the business
of the House of Representatives.
But while the Democrats have
won the contest, the Republican
Partv, it can fairly be said, has

1 been saved much trouble and em
barrassment. It has been saved
from being identified as the party
of extremist reaction and obstruc
tion.
This would have been embar
rassing because Sen. Thurston
j Morton, the chairman of the Re
publican National Committee, rea
lizes that "President Kennedy has
perempted the center." Had the
I Smith-Halleck coalition won the
! contest on Tuesday, the Rcpubli
, can Party would have been un-
I able to challenge President Ken
. nedy's command of the center.
THE CENTER in American po
' litical life is an enormous major
ity of the people, and the party
; which controls the center is vir
-1 tually unbeatable. The Republi
cans controlled it mo-st of the
time from the Civil War to the
Taft-Roosevelt schism of 1912.
J The Democrats controlled il from
; the great depression to the
Korean War. Eisenhower had a
; chance to lake command of it and
to inaugurate a new Republican
[ era. But he did not know how to
! go about it. But this young man
Kennedy understands perfectly
the meaning of the center. He in
tends to lead it, and he knows
how to go about doing it.
He has only to resolve the ap-
I prehensions of the Democrats
who left the party on the religious
issue, and to draw to his Admin
istration a large part of the Rock
efeller Republicans. There is no
deep doctrinal or ideological dif
ference between the Kennedy
Demcrats and Republicans like
1 Rockefeller and Dillon and Case
! and Cooper.
Barring a catastrophe such as
I war, or an accident like a panic
1 or a scandal, a combination of the
| center is almost impossible 1o
beat. A victory of the Smith-
Halleck coalition would have
made life very difficult for the
Rockefeller Republicans and
would have promoted greatly the
formation by President Kennedy
of a combination of the center.
So we can say that while it had
a close shave on Tuesday, the
| Republican Party did escape a
i victory which would have been
much worst than the defeat.

When we tr*' to read the mean
ing of the vote about enlarging
the Committee on Rules of the
House, we must bear in mind that
it took place at the very begin
ning of the Kennedy administra
tion. The Kennedy program on
which the House will have to act
has not yet been published, in
deed a great deal of it has not
yet been worked out in legislative
form. All that was before the
House was the Democratic plat
form, campaign speeches of both
parties, the inaugural address,
and Last Monday's message. These
are general statements of purpose
and policy but they do not con
tain specifications about the laws
that will be asked for or the
money that will be needed. The

task force re
ports, while they
provide insight
into the thinking
of Kennedy's ad
visors, are not
Administra
tion legislative
proposals.
Thus, the ac
tion in the House
was a reflection
of what has gone

before. The vote was close as the
election was close. This vote does
not necessarily, or even probably,
anticipate the future which is
likely to be very different when
President Kennedy has begun to
act, and 1o make decisions, and
to propose not merely policies but
programs and measures. Presum
ably when he is being the leader
and not merely talking about
leadership, he will continue to
grow stronger. Indeed he is al
ready considerably stronger in his
popular support thai he was on
election day.
ONE CAN, therefore, easily ex
aggerate the significance of the
vote. There is. however, no doubt
of its practical importance. In ef
fect, the House transferred to
Speaker Rayburn from Rep. How
ard W. Smith the power to deter
mint what shall be the business
of the House of Representatives.
But while the Democrats have
won the contest, the Republican
Partv, it can fairly be said, has

1 been saved much trouble and em
barrassment. It has been saved
from being identified as the party
of extremist reaction and obstruc
tion.
This would have been embar
rassing because Sen. Thurston
j Morton, the chairman of the Re
publican National Committee, rea
lizes that "President Kennedy has
perempted the center." Had the
I Smith-Halleck coalition won the

and not merely talking about
leadership, he will continue to
grow stronger. Indeed he is al
ready considerably stronger in his
popular support thai he was on
election day.
ONE CAN, therefore, easily ex
aggerate the significance of the
vote. There is. however, no doubt
of its practical importance. In ef
fect, the House transferred to
Speaker Rayburn from Rep. How
ard W. Smith the power to deter
mint what shall be the business
of the House of Representatives.
But while the Democrats have
won the contest, the Republican
Partv, it can fairly be said, has

1 been saved much trouble and em
barrassment. It has been saved
from being identified as the party
of extremist reaction and obstruc
tion.
This would have been embar
rassing because Sen. Thurston
j Morton, the chairman of the Re
publican National Committee, rea
lizes that "President Kennedy has
perempted the center." Had the
I Smith-Halleck coalition won the
! contest on Tuesday, the Rcpubli
, can Party would have been un-
I able to challenge President Ken
. nedy's command of the center.
THE CENTER in American po
' litical life is an enormous major
ity of the people, and the party
; which controls the center is vir
-1 tually unbeatable. The Republi
cans controlled it mo-st of the
time from the Civil War to the
Taft-Roosevelt schism of 1912.
J The Democrats controlled il from
; the great depression to the
Korean War. Eisenhower had a
; chance to lake command of it and
to inaugurate a new Republican
[ era. But he did not know how to
! go about it. But this young man
Kennedy understands perfectly
the meaning of the center. He in
tends to lead it, and he knows
how to go about doing it.
He has only to resolve the ap-
I prehensions of the Democrats
who left the party on the religious
issue, and to draw to his Admin
istration a large part of the Rock
efeller Republicans. There is no
deep doctrinal or ideological dif
ference between the Kennedy
Demcrats and Republicans like
1 Rockefeller and Dillon and Case
! and Cooper.
Barring a catastrophe such as
I war, or an accident like a panic
1 or a scandal, a combination of the
| center is almost impossible 1o
beat. A victory of the Smith-
Halleck coalition would have
made life very difficult for the
Rockefeller Republicans and
would have promoted greatly the
formation by President Kennedy
of a combination of the center.
So we can say that while it had
a close shave on Tuesday, the
| Republican Party did escape a
i victory which would have been
much worst than the defeat.
