# "I DIDN'T WANT TO BE STOCKPILED"

When Loren Gergens was working for his
B.S. degree in Business Administration at the
University of Denver, he had definite ideas about
the kind of job he wanted to land. He was de
termined to profit from the experience of several
of his friends who had accepted promising jobs
only to find themselves in "manpower pools" —
waiting to be pulled into a responsible position.
"I didn't want to be stockpiled," Loren says.
"That's no way to start."
As a senior, Loren talked to twelve companies
and joined The Mountain States Telephone &
Telegraph Company, an associated company of
the Bell Telephone System.
From his first day challenges were thrown at
him thick and fast. First, he supervised a group
of service representatives who handle the com
munications needs of telephone customers. Then

ho served as manager of several telephone busi
ness offices. In these jobs Loren had to prove
himself on the firing line, make right decisions
and carry them through. He knew his next jump
depended on only one man—Loren (lergens.
Tn July, 19(50, he was made Sales Manager
in Boulder, Colorado.
"I'm on the ground floor of a newly created
telephone marketing organization. And I can tell
you things are going to move fast!" Loren says.
"It's rough at times, but hard work is fun when
you know you're going somewhere—in a busi
ness where there's somewhere to go."
If you're interested in a job in which you can
be your own prime mover—a job in which you're
given a chance to show what you can do, right from ■
the start—you'll want to visit your Placement Office
for literature and additional information.

"Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intelli
