end losing to Washington 71-47 1
and Washington State 83-63.

Huskies gave the boys from j

three meetings of the teams and I
dropped Stanford's Big Five rec
ord to 2-2.
With Bill Hanson, their 0-8 con-;
tor, contributing 21 points Wash
ington led all the way and the
Cards never got any closer than
nine points in the second half.
THE KICV to the contest was

fense that continually picked up!
sloppy Indian passes.

ford scoring with 12 points fol-1
lowed by co-captain John Hendry
with 10.
Stanford hit only 2G per cent of
its field goal tries in the first half
and 33 per cent for the full route
while Washington scored at a

SATURDAY night's clash with
the Cougars was more of the'
same as the Pullman quintet
started fast and then held its lead.
Stanford managed to close the
deficit to four points at the half
36-32 but Ihe Indians couldn't
overhaul the Cougars who kept:
the pressure on with their good I
sh noting.
Darell Sutherland, Card sopho
more, led a second-half rally that
moved the Indians to within eight
points at 60-52 with eight minutes
left but the Cougars didn't crack.
Sutherland finished with 19
points to lead both teams. For- 1
ward John Windsor meshed 12
and swing man Phil Kelly counted
14 for the Tribe.
