lime margin as compared to the
17-0 bulge they held at the end

ous meeting. The Cards won the

scrum which easily dominated the

difficulty in gelling the ball out
to the backs, and but for this the
score might ha v e been even
higher.
Kmotovic named Sieve Pursell,
Jon Brandin, and Tom McDonald
as outstanding among (he for
wards and citod scrum half Bobby
Price, Rick McMillen. and Stan
Lindskog as stickouts in Ihe back
