# Dose Leads Fresh Win
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team rallied from deficits of up
to 10 points to win a close one
from the Santa Clara frosh 67-64
Friday night at Santa Clara.
HIGH SCORING Card center
Tom Dose was brilliant in lead
ing his mates from behind in the
second half. He popped 38 points.
Santa Clara led at the half 36-30
mainly on ihe hot shooting of 6-6
forward Dick Garibaldi. Garibaldi
had 10 points in the opening
stanza.
With 10 minutes left in Ihe
game and Santa Clara leading by
10 points. Garibaldi fouled out.
THIS seemed to touch off a
spark for ihe Indians and they
staged a vicious come-from-behind
rally.
With Dose in charge of the
heavy firing, Coach Bill Turner's
boys made il all Ihe way back
and held on to win.
Dose made 15 of 27 shots from
the floor and added 8 charity
tosses for his 38 markers. Lew
Shupe added 13 for the Cards.
Since records are not kept on
freshman sports it is not positive,
but to the best of everyone's
knowledge who is close to the
Stanford sports scene Dose's 38
points is the single game record.
