# Waltz Called One of Farm's Most Polished Productions
## 
### MARY LOU McKINLEY 
Willi a talented cast, an outstanding performance by experienced actor Hichard Hisso and lh<
fine direction of Robert Loper, jean Anouilh s "The Waltz of the Toreadors" i- clearh one of tin
most polished shows ever produced bv the Stanford Players.
The play, as savage and philosophical in parts as it is farcical in others, opened Frida\ in Mem
orial Auditorium. It will continue this Frida\ and Saturdav nights.

As General St. Pe, who, in his
own words, has beneath his uni
form "the heart of an aged young
ster," Risso is superb.
CI.EA R L Y communicating
every emotion, both vocally and
visually, which is appropriate to
and creates the character, Risso's
performance is p e r 112 e c t 1 y con
trolled at all times, whether he
is reflecting to himself or trying
to get his swords down from the
wall in a frenzy.
This control, coupled with an
ability to pause at just the right
time to make a point, either comic
or serious, and movements which
convey the general whenever he
appears, create a character who
is cohesive and believable
throughout.
Some of the most philosophical
lines in the play are spoken by
the general's sympathetic friend.
Dr. Bonfant. Well played by Stev
en Gilborn who has an excellent
speaking voice, the character was
designed as a foil for the general
and primary figure in the play
but appears almost too all-know
ing and unrealistic at times.
Lisa Lauterer as the general's
shrewish wife also gives a good
performance. The stage setting is
a distracting element in the scene
between her and the general, how
ever, with a bright pink bed can
opy which tends to draw the eye
away from the performers and
hinder audience concentration.
PLAYING the general's young
secretary Gaston, Douglas John
son again displays his fine sense
of timing for comedy plus a new
polish and confidence which pro
duces a fine characterization. The
scene between him and the gen
eral in tho first part of Act Two
is one of the best in the produc
tion.
Another finished portrayal is
given by Margaret Landry as the
general's romantic dream whom
he met IT years ago, Mile, de St.
Euverte.
Michael Addison takes the role
of Father Ambrose with skill and
control and does not produce an
exaggeration which the character
could easily become.
ADDING to the play are Jean
Guthrie and Margaret Cowles as
the general's two silly daughters,
Jane Hovvells and Georgia Ryther
as the maids and Pauline Peotter
as the dressmaker Mme. Dupont-
Fredaine.
Director Loper has compliment
ed his cast's abilities with well
paced movement which adds to
the show's interest throughout.
The scenery, however, is too
massive and, while realistic and
suitable to the play in this re
spect. is too del ailed to permit
easy, steady concentration on the
stage action and play itself.
Tickets for "The Waltz of the
Toreadors" are on sale at Memo
rial Auditorium Box Office, priced
at $1.12.". $!.,")(I, $2 and $2.50.

Willi a talented cast, an outstanding performance by experienced actor Hichard Hisso and lh<
fine direction of Robert Loper, jean Anouilh s "The Waltz of the Toreadors" i- clearh one of tin
most polished shows ever produced bv the Stanford Players.
The play, as savage and philosophical in parts as it is farcical in others, opened Frida\ in Mem
orial Auditorium. It will continue this Frida\ and Saturdav nights.

As General St. Pe, who, in his
own words, has beneath his uni
form "the heart of an aged young
ster," Risso is superb.
CI.EA R L Y communicating
every emotion, both vocally and
visually, which is appropriate to
and creates the character, Risso's
performance is p e r 112 e c t 1 y con
trolled at all times, whether he
is reflecting to himself or trying
to get his swords down from the
wall in a frenzy.
This control, coupled with an
ability to pause at just the right
time to make a point, either comic
or serious, and movements which
convey the general whenever he
appears, create a character who
is cohesive and believable
throughout.
Some of the most philosophical
lines in the play are spoken by
the general's sympathetic friend.
Dr. Bonfant. Well played by Stev
en Gilborn who has an excellent
speaking voice, the character was
designed as a foil for the general
and primary figure in the play
but appears almost too all-know
ing and unrealistic at times.
Lisa Lauterer as the general's
shrewish wife also gives a good
performance. The stage setting is
a distracting element in the scene
between her and the general, how
ever, with a bright pink bed can
opy which tends to draw the eye
away from the performers and
hinder audience concentration.
PLAYING the general's young
secretary Gaston, Douglas John
son again displays his fine sense
of timing for comedy plus a new
polish and confidence which pro
duces a fine characterization. The
scene between him and the gen
eral in tho first part of Act Two
is one of the best in the produc
tion.
Another finished portrayal is
given by Margaret Landry as the
general's romantic dream whom
he met IT years ago, Mile, de St.
Euverte.
Michael Addison takes the role
of Father Ambrose with skill and
control and does not produce an
exaggeration which the character
could easily become.
ADDING to the play are Jean
Guthrie and Margaret Cowles as
the general's two silly daughters,
Jane Hovvells and Georgia Ryther
as the maids and Pauline Peotter
as the dressmaker Mme. Dupont-
Fredaine.
Director Loper has compliment
ed his cast's abilities with well
paced movement which adds to
the show's interest throughout.
The scenery, however, is too
massive and, while realistic and
suitable to the play in this re
spect. is too del ailed to permit
easy, steady concentration on the
stage action and play itself.
