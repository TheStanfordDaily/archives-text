# Kerensky Corrects Error in Daily Story
## 
### 
Alexander Kerensky, prime
minister of Russia's provisional
government in 1917 and now
working at the Hoover Library,
was incorrectly quoted in part of
a story run in Friday's Daily.
Kerensky notes the article was
"an excellent one and" reported
"the occasion correctly, except for
the paragraph before the last one"
which read:
"The Marxists say that if a man
has a right to kill 100 million ani
mals, a man may exterminate the
whole bourgeois class for the ben
efit of the proletariat. Marxists
believe that they must do away
with the ideal of morality since
the bourgeoisie use it to oppress
the working class."
HK CLARIFIED the mistake in
the following letter to the editor:
"First, I never in my life main
tained that Marxists thought they
had to abandon the ideal of moral
ity.
"What I did say during my dis
cussion . . . was as follows: In the
spring of 1919, Lenin said in a con
versation with some foreigners
visiting in Moscow: 'If the capi
talist governments for the sake of
their imperialistic aims killed dur
ing the war 11911-18» many mil
lions of human beings, we, for the

sake of our aims to liberate all
the working classes from eco
nomic slavery have the right to
many dozens of million of men.'
"And from his point of view
Lenin was right because, accord
ing to the teachings of Marx, mor
ality is only the product of class
interest sand 1 hat bourgeois
morals is only a weapon in the
hands of the capitalists class to
exploit and subjugate the labor
class.
"SECOND, speaking of the very
popular purely scientific and ma
terialistic explanation of human
beings in the 19th century, I said
that all the incredible atrocities
committed after the first war by
the Communists in Russia and
Hitlerites in Germany were a logi
cal consequence of complete ne
gation of the dignity of man and
his spiritual qualities and the be
lief that man is an animal in no
way differing from the rest of the
organic world.
"The final deduction from this
materialistic philosophy is a prac
tical idea that to achieve their
social and political aims the party
has the right to exterminate, if
necessary, an endless number of
human beings, just as other ani
mals must be exterminated."

believe that they must do away
with the ideal of morality since
the bourgeoisie use it to oppress
the working class."
HK CLARIFIED the mistake in
the following letter to the editor:
"First, I never in my life main
tained that Marxists thought they
had to abandon the ideal of moral
ity.
"What I did say during my dis
cussion . . . was as follows: In the
spring of 1919, Lenin said in a con
versation with some foreigners
visiting in Moscow: 'If the capi
talist governments for the sake of
their imperialistic aims killed dur
ing the war 11911-18» many mil
lions of human beings, we, for the

sake of our aims to liberate all
the working classes from eco
nomic slavery have the right to
many dozens of million of men.'
"And from his point of view
Lenin was right because, accord
ing to the teachings of Marx, mor
ality is only the product of class
interest sand 1 hat bourgeois
morals is only a weapon in the
hands of the capitalists class to
exploit and subjugate the labor
class.
"SECOND, speaking of the very
popular purely scientific and ma
terialistic explanation of human
beings in the 19th century, I said
that all the incredible atrocities
committed after the first war by
the Communists in Russia and
Hitlerites in Germany were a logi
cal consequence of complete ne
gation of the dignity of man and
his spiritual qualities and the be
lief that man is an animal in no
way differing from the rest of the
organic world.
"The final deduction from this
materialistic philosophy is a prac
tical idea that to achieve their
social and political aims the party
has the right to exterminate, if
necessary, an endless number of
human beings, just as other ani
mals must be exterminated."
Alexander Kerensky, prime
minister of Russia's provisional
government in 1917 and now
working at the Hoover Library,
was incorrectly quoted in part of
a story run in Friday's Daily.
Kerensky notes the article was
"an excellent one and" reported
"the occasion correctly, except for
the paragraph before the last one"
which read:
"The Marxists say that if a man
has a right to kill 100 million ani
mals, a man may exterminate the
whole bourgeois class for the ben
efit of the proletariat. Marxists
believe that they must do away
with the ideal of morality since
the bourgeoisie use it to oppress
the working class."
