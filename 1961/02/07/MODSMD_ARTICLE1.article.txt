# Gold Plan Sent to Congress by JFK
## 
### 
W ASH I \CTON il IM) â€” President Kennedy sought vigorous
congressional action yesterday to end the drain of U.S. gold re
serves and dollars In curbing American spending abroad and
stepping up efforts to woo foreign customers and investors.
One feature of his broad-scale program was a recommendation

that (he amount of duty-free pur-1
chases an American tourist can j
bring into the country every six I
months be cut from $500 to $100. j
KKNNKDY also asked Congress
in a special message to prevent j
the abuse of foreign "tax havens" i
by some American firms. He said.
he has ordered the treasury to de
cide whether U.S. tax laws might '
be partially responsible for driv
ing out "undue amounts" of I
American capital.
In all, he recommended more
than a score of actions to stem the
10-year-old flow of U.S. funds
abroad and to keep the dollar "as j
good as gold." His proposals were i
both short-range and long-range;
they involved action both by the
White House and Congress.
They ranged from a new gov-:
ernment program to encourage J
people of other nations to travel
in this country to complex inter-1
national investment and banking
moves both here and abroad. Ken
nedy strongly urged throughout i
that U.S. industry and labor make
every effort to compete more!
strongly with foreign sellers in |
the world market.
HE EMPHASIZED the need for
cooperation on the part of free j
world allied governments and j
American servicemen and their [
families abroad.
Kennedy's program was well re-1
ceived by Republicans as well as ,
Democrats.
Senate Republican leader:
Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois told |
the Senate the message "is by all ,
odds, one of the most important j
. . . that will come to Congress." i
He said he did not know "how ef
feetive" the President's proposed
remedies might be and said:!
"Every one of them is going to I
have very careful scrutiny."
REP. JOHN. W. Byrnes, R-Wis., !
chairman of the House GOP Pol-!
icy Committee, said the cutback
in the American tourist duty al- j
lowance was "probably advisable." |
Russell E. Singer, executive
vice president of the American
Automobile Association, said the!
step would probably "have little [
effect on U.S. tourist traffic I
abroad." He said a one-month sur
vey last year showed that only
one out of every 10 returning j
Americans exceeded the."300 1
limit.
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, D-Ark.. I
praised the fact that Kennedy re
jected any return to high tariff j
"protectionism" and called for in
creased exports of U.S. farm!
products.
CHAIRMAN A. Willis Robert
son, D-Va., of the Senate Banking j
Committee, said the proposals
would bo "helpful" but should be
backed up by curbs on foreign aid
and other spending.
A Republican, Rep. Harold C.
Ostertag, of New York introduced |
a bill to create a new travel of
fice in the Commerce Committee j
one of the stops favored by Ken- j
nedy to encourage travel to this j
country by foreigners.
Kennedy's message on gold and !
the dollar drain was the third he
has submitted to Congress since:
entering the office.
