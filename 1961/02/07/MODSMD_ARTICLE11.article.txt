.1. MARTINET, curator of prints
and drawings for the Municipal

Museums of Amsterdam, says of

where. this century lias witnessed
the evolution of the print from the
radius of action as a free and in
dependent work of art.

the 20th century in common, is the
product of a unique individual,
who has not simply tried to com
ply with the market. We in Hol

ticipate too in the artists' pleas
ures of creation."
