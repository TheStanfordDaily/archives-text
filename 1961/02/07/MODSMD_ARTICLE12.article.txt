# Rusk Asks New UN Plan To Bring Peace to Congo
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Secretary of State Dean Kusk called
yesterday lor a new Lnited Nations plan which would restore
order to the Congo and remove it from the East-West battleground.
At liis first news conference since taking office, lie said the
l.nited Stales and other nations were consulting to see if the U.\.

operation in The Congo could be I
strengthened so peace and order|
could be restored.
AS PART of the plan, Rusk i
! suggested international supervi-j
sion of arms shipments into The I
Congo. He said similar interna
tional controls should be estab
lished to prevent illicit arms
deliveries to the southeast Asian
trouble spot of Laos.
"We would hope that it would
be possible," he said, "to save
some of these parts of the world,
that are primarily interested in
the development of their own re
sources and the well-being of their
own people, from being caught up
in the turbulence of some of the
larger problems outside."
Rusk also warned Americans
i
not to expect a cold war thaw
simply because Russia has shown
signs of being reasonable towards
President Kennedy's administra
tion. He said Soviet actions to
wards both the Congo and Laos
were among the tests of the new
Russian attitude.
HL ALSO proposed a major co
operative effort to build the econ
omies and strengthen the demo
cratic institutions of Latin Amer
ica. Without mentioning specific
steps to deal with the "tragedy"
of Cuba, he said the United States
is prepared to cooperate actively
with the other American states
"to end tyranny, whether of the
left or right."

On other points, he said the
Kennedy administration is study
ing the thorny problem of how to
b ring Communist China into
world disarmament negotiations.
Eisenhower administration offi
cials also had made it clear that
the Red Chinese would have to be
brought into any disarmament
schemes.
Rusk said it would not be easy
to achieve world nuclear disarma
ment. unless all nuclear powers
were included in an international
treaty.
HE ANNOUNCED that Arthur
H. Dean, one-time law partner of
I John Foster Dulles and a former
U.S. representative to the talks
for the end of the Korean War.
would be the principal U.S. nego
tiator when talks resume at
Geneva March 21 on nuclear test
ban.
Whether the United States re
sumes test* will depend on prog
ress at Geneva, he said.
The secretary outlined the U.S.
attitude toward The Congo in a
prepared statement. He said that
"In recent days we have been con
sulting with the secretary-general
(Dag Hammarskjold) and a num
ber of member governments to
learn whether the present man
date of the United Nations can be
clarified or strengthened in the
hope that peace and order might
return to The Congo."
Although Rusk did not mention i
details, the plan was reported to j
call for big power agreement to j
support the United Nations in the j
"neutralization" of the five war
ring military forces in The Congo
and the freeing of all political
prisoners, including Russian
backed former Premier Patrice
Lumumba.
ALSO IT would establish a coa
lition government representing as
many as possible of the country's
warring elements. It also would
set up a federation government in
which individual provinces would
have considerable autonomy.
Rusk flatly refused to comment
when asked if the United States
favored the release of Lumumba.
On Capitol Hill, Chairman J.
William Fulbright of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee told
reporters that "any coalition that j
includes Lumumba would be very
dangerous" because of his orienta
tion towards the Soviet bloc, j

WASHINGTON (UPD—Secretary of State Dean Kusk called
yesterday lor a new Lnited Nations plan which would restore
order to the Congo and remove it from the East-West battleground.
At liis first news conference since taking office, lie said the
l.nited Stales and other nations were consulting to see if the U.\.

operation in The Congo could be I
strengthened so peace and order|
could be restored.
AS PART of the plan, Rusk i
! suggested international supervi-j
sion of arms shipments into The I
Congo. He said similar interna
tional controls should be estab
lished to prevent illicit arms
deliveries to the southeast Asian
trouble spot of Laos.
"We would hope that it would
be possible," he said, "to save
some of these parts of the world,
that are primarily interested in
the development of their own re
sources and the well-being of their
own people, from being caught up
in the turbulence of some of the
larger problems outside."
Rusk also warned Americans
i
not to expect a cold war thaw
simply because Russia has shown
signs of being reasonable towards
President Kennedy's administra
tion. He said Soviet actions to
wards both the Congo and Laos
were among the tests of the new
Russian attitude.
HL ALSO proposed a major co
operative effort to build the econ
omies and strengthen the demo
cratic institutions of Latin Amer
ica. Without mentioning specific
steps to deal with the "tragedy"
of Cuba, he said the United States
is prepared to cooperate actively
with the other American states
"to end tyranny, whether of the
left or right."
