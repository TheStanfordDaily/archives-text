# Peace Negotiations; Backed With Power
## 
### 
Senator Barry Goldwater's speech here last Friday was a finely
articulated statement of arch-conservative ideals in the field of in
ternational relations.
Mr. Goldwater stated that "In order to preserve the peace we
must preserve our power." He pointed to the historical example of
England as a country whose mastery of the sea meant a mastery
of the world. And therefore he urged a return to U-2 overflights
while warning that disarmament would be disastrous.
This is not advice we should disregard. Nor should we disregard
the advice from the far left of disarmament at any costs. Rather we
should realize the "tunneled vision" of both positions and combine
them into one of a strengthened and dynamic world position for
the United States.
Both East and West have in their possession weapons of self
destruction on a scale never known before to civilization. With
such a condition in being we must not only build our military
establishment into the strongest in the world but also work to make
sure its research is abreast of the latest developments in the making
of war. We cannot afford to tempt an aggressor with a posture of
weakness. Only when our military establishment is strong without
doubt can we be sure that these destructive weapons will never
be employed.
Yet, this does not mean, 4 as Mr. Goldwater believes, that we
should continue U-2 overflights. Nor does it mean that we should
shy from the disarmament table. With both East and West holding
weapons of self-destruction in a balance of terror we must falter
towards some definite proposals for the inspection, limitation and
control of armaments. Let both Soviets and Americans, as President
Kennedy has said, "bring the absolute power to destroy other na
tions under the absolute control of all nations. Let both sides join
to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors."
We should remember that the talons of the Eagle of the United
States hold both olive branches and arrows. Let us put forth the
olive branch—holding the arrows in ready reserve.
