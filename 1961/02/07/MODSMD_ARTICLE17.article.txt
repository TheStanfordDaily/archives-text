# Winter Charity Drive Enters Second Day
## 
### 
As the annual Winter Charity Drive moves into its second day
we urge students to look at its goals—and then, if they see fit,
to give.
The money from the week-long campaign, ably directed by
Cardinals Board under the direction of Joanie Cowell and Dave
Kelly, will be turned over to the United Fund, Heart Association
and Negro Scholarship Fund.
Everyone knows the work of the Heart Association in finding
new ways to prevent heart disease and in helping heart victims.
And too most of us are familiar with the many subsidiary organiza
tions which the United Fund underwrites.
The Negro Scholarship Fund helps Negro high school students
from throughout the country to find colleges and universities of
their choice. The Fund contacts the students as they enter high
school and finds Negroes who possess the capabilities of univer
sity work, but for reasons of poverty or slum conditions would not
normally enroll in a pre-college curriculum. It helps these students
into a pre-college study-plan and in their senior year to select a
compatible college.
The Cardinals Board has used its imagination in finding ways
for us to give in both the Winter Drive's Flick and the Ugly Man
Contest which begins today.
We urge you to look at the goals of Winter Drives. Collections
will be made in the living groups.
