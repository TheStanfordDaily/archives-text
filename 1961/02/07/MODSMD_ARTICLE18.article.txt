President Kennedy's decision to halt the live televising of his
press conferences comes as no surprise.
Over-exposure was not the acknowledged reason, but it was
certainly important.
President Eisenhower permitted his conferences to be filmed,
and little of what he said actually got on TV. As a result, when
he wanted to go before the people and enlist public opinion for
some cause, he got the full attention of the TV-viewing audience.
If Mr. Kennedy continued on live TV once a week or so, the
edge would be off any additional talks, no matter how big the
advance build-up.
Even at the second conference the interest seemed to have
waned. It's just as well if they are ended.
