## It's a Long, Long Way to Palo Alto 
### 
Our neighbors 11»f» Dallons have sent their young son Eric to a
private prep school in an idyllic valley somewhere near Santa
Barbara to harden his head for Stanford.
He is an only child and so, of course, they are beginning to
notice his absence in many subtle ways.

FOR ONE thing, the water
level of the Dalton swimming
pool has gone clown. Eric himself
displaced about IIT lb. dead
weight. He was a a permanent
fixture in the pool. The Daltons
even went to the trouble of devis
ing a floating Iray to feed him
egg sandwiches during hot spells.
His mother got a nice tan just
waiting on him.
The reason they sent him away
to prep .school is that Stanford has
raised its requirements since Dal
ton went there and they have to
give the boy extra thrusts.
THE DALTONS obviously miss
the lad, but he warms their hearts
by writing now and then, when
he needs something.
Mrs. Dalton rushed over the
other morning to show us one of
his first communications. It was
addressed "Occupant." Eric ap
parently didn't want to let on to
the other boys in school that he
had a mother and father. At his
age parents are regarded as a so

rial stigma.
In the letter itself, however, he
recognized the relationship, be
ginning with the salutation, "Dear
Folks."
Then he went at once to the
heart of his problem.
"Didn't you get my letter ask
ing for the stuff?" he wrote. "So
far you haven't mentioned it.
Maybe by the time you get this
it will be here. I don't want to
seem ungrateful, but I'm getting
desperate."
"What is it the boy wants?" I
asked Mrs. Dalton. "Maybe it's
something we could help with.
Pencils? Notebooks? Slide rule?" j
"Read on," she said. "Read on." |
"In case you didn't get my other
letter." he wrote, "here's what I
would like you to send me.
"Fizzies (lot's of them). Gum
(not too much). Tang (one jar).
Cookies (one package). The ones
you sent up before are all gone.
They were good.
"I WILL. BE pretty well set if
'you could send me these things.
You probably already have. I
! have about a B average. Ou est
lepetit grateau?"
"What's that mean," I asked.
"Ou est le petit grateau?"
"Isn't that wonderful?" said his
mother. "He's learning French al- 1
ready. It means where are the j
little cookies, I think."
"Big deal," I said. "Apparently
he hasn't learned that the pos-1
sessive apostrophe doesn't belong
in the word lots, in reference to
Fizzies, whatever they are."
"THEY'RE LITTLE things that
go with the Tang," she explained.
"That's instant orange juice."
"It's none of my business," I
told Mrs. Dalton, "but it seems to
me you're indulging the boy. Let j
him deny himself for a change,
learn how to live with austerity." !
"Listen," my wife said. She had
been fishing through her memen
tos and had a yellowed scrap of
paper with the bold letterhead of
the 4th Division, U.S. Marine
Corps. Apparently it was some lit
tle something I had written her
during World War 11, in a mo
ment of weakness.
"Ou est le petit grateau?" she
read. "Us men are getting desper
ate."
