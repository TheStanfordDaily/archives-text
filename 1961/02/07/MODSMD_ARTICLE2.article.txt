schools participating.
SAYLER and Best will return

week, according to forensics direc

journey to Harvard for a debate
in return for the Crimson's visit
ing Stanford last month.

at the Virginia tourney.
They debated against the Uni

ON THEIR trip to the cold part
of the country Sayler and Best
won all of the debates at stops
they made en route to Virginia,
such as Princeton and Columbia.
At Princeton, the Stanford team
took the affirmative on the medi

Princeton team by a vote of the
audience.
