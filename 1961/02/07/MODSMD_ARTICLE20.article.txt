## Let's Throw A Big Nazi Rally in N.Y. 
### 
What this country needs is a
good 5-cent Nazi rally.
George Rockwell, leader of the
"American Nazi Party" wants to
hold one — in New York's Union
Square — on the fourth of July.
Just like anyone else who wants
to hold a rally, Rockwell con
tacted the New York Police Com
missioner for a permit, making
formal application with Ihe De
partment of Parks. The Square
is open for use by anyone—Com
munists included, and Commu
nists have used it.
BUT ROCKWELL was turned
down. He appealed his case, and
was mobbed in the courtroom.

Mayo r Robert J
Wagner listened
to the protests of
Negro, Jewish
and "liberal" or
ganizations and
spoke of the
I "limits of free
! dom," making an
(exception to
Rockwell.
Communists
are permitted to

.speak in Union Square (but have
given up the practice as the place
attracts pigeon-feeders and small
- children only). None of the Jewish
and Negro organizations have
protested the Communist rallies.
Mayor Wagner listened to the
organizations in banning Rock
well, therefore the Jews are Com
munists, and Wagner is their
dupe. The reasoning mind finds
this highly false logic, but in the
; hands of anti-Semite Rockwell, it's
j dynamite.
1)11) ROCKWELL want to
speak in Union Square? Of course
not. The American Jewish Com
mittee estimates he has twenty
five supporters. Who would listen
to him? What Rockwell wanted,
and what Rockwell got, was to bo
banned from making his speech.
This is now a good piece of propa
ganda. "Common Sense," an anti-
Semitic magazine, recognized this
in an article entitled "Free Speech
in New York Only for Commu
nists."
Would a New York Rally have
turned the city into a screaming
mob? Hardly, with the population
consisting of Puerto Ricans, Ne
groes, Catholics and Jews. By op
posing Rockwell, aid is being
given to the very totalitarianism
we oppose.
A new development has now
come up in the case. The San
Francisco Examiner of Feb. 3
commented editorially on Rock
well's application for a passport to
Australia, stating he ". . . should
be denied a passport, if that, is
possible . . . And if a passport has
to be granted the Australians . . .
(should) withold a visa."
NO, SAN Francisco Examiner,
it isn't possible to withold a pass
port because we don't like a man.
There are several solutions to the
problem: a) we could execute him
for his beliefs, using Sacco-Van
zetti as a precedent; b) we could
form a sub-committee of HUAC
to investigate Nazi activities in
order to bring all professors who
belong to the American Civil Lib
erties Union (who is backing
Rockwell's right for a permit > to
the light of exposure; or c) we
could let him speak to the pigeons
and crack-pots he would draw,
and prove, not only that America
is a democracy, but that Lincoln
Rockwell couldn't draw a crowd.
When little Hitler returns to
court in New York, I hope he re
receives the same right as any
i other nut to stand on a soapbox.
We'll survive and come out
j healthier—but Lincoln Rockwell
I won't.

are permitted to

given up the practice as the place
attracts pigeon-feeders and small

Mayor Wagner listened to the

well, therefore the Jews are Com

1)11) ROCKWELL want to
speak in Union Square? Of course
not. The American Jewish Com
mittee estimates he has twenty
five supporters. Who would listen
to him? What Rockwell wanted,
and what Rockwell got, was to bo
banned from making his speech.
This is now a good piece of propa
ganda. "Common Sense," an anti-
Semitic magazine, recognized this
in an article entitled "Free Speech
in New York Only for Commu
nists."
Would a New York Rally have
turned the city into a screaming
mob? Hardly, with the population
consisting of Puerto Ricans, Ne
groes, Catholics and Jews. By op
posing Rockwell, aid is being
given to the very totalitarianism
we oppose.
A new development has now
come up in the case. The San
Francisco Examiner of Feb. 3
commented editorially on Rock
well's application for a passport to
Australia, stating he ". . . should
be denied a passport, if that, is
possible . . . And if a passport has
to be granted the Australians . . .
(should) withold a visa."
NO, SAN Francisco Examiner,
it isn't possible to withold a pass
port because we don't like a man.
There are several solutions to the
problem: a) we could execute him
for his beliefs, using Sacco-Van
zetti as a precedent; b) we could
form a sub-committee of HUAC
to investigate Nazi activities in
order to bring all professors who
belong to the American Civil Lib
erties Union (who is backing
Rockwell's right for a permit > to
the light of exposure; or c) we
could let him speak to the pigeons
and crack-pots he would draw,
and prove, not only that America
is a democracy, but that Lincoln
Rockwell couldn't draw a crowd.
When little Hitler returns to
court in New York, I hope he re
receives the same right as any
i other nut to stand on a soapbox.
We'll survive and come out

What this country needs is a
good 5-cent Nazi rally.
George Rockwell, leader of the
"American Nazi Party" wants to
hold one — in New York's Union
Square — on the fourth of July.
Just like anyone else who wants
to hold a rally, Rockwell con
tacted the New York Police Com
missioner for a permit, making
formal application with Ihe De
partment of Parks. The Square
is open for use by anyone—Com
munists included, and Commu
nists have used it.
BUT ROCKWELL was turned
down. He appealed his case, and
was mobbed in the courtroom.
