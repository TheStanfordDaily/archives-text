# Induction Age Rises With Available Manpower
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) — About
1,420,000 American boys will cele
brate their 18th birthdays in 1961.
Each of them will go through
the modern "manhood riiual" of
registering for the draft.
But—barring some interna
tional cataclysm that requires an
all-out U.S. mobilization not one
of them will actually be drafted
into the armed forces for at least
four years.
The present average of induc
tion is 23. The age may vary from
one local board to another by as
much as two or Ihree months.
In filling their quotas, draft
boards tap the oldest men avail
able in the pool of eligibles. If the
manpower pool is growing as it
is and will continue to do—the
age at which men get summoned
tends to grow steadily higher.
Previous experience indicates
that approximately half of this
year's crop of 18-year-olds will be

mentally and physically quali
fied for military service.
But the number of men enter
ing the armed forces by induction
or voluntary enlistment will be
only about 500,000.
Scratch another ."50,000 for mis
cellaneous exemptions and defer
ments, and you have a net incre
ment of about 150,000 a year for
the manpower pool.
Does this mean that a young
man who sits it out has a good

chance of avoiding the draft al
together?
The official answer is that "vir
tually no non-fathers, qualified
and available for service, are
likely to escape their service obli
gation" during the next few years.
Under current selective service
regulations, fathers automatically
go into a special category, to be
drafted only if the pool of eligi
ble non-fathers has been ex
hausted.
