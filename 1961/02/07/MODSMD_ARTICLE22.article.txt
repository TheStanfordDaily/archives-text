A myriad of adjectives has been used to describe the slate ot
Terns uid its people—mammoth, proud, triumphant, conceited. One
word that should always be listed up near the top is determined.
For many years now the inhabitants of such great metropolises
as Dallas and Houston have been smarting under the Eastern-im
j>')s< (1 judgment that Texas could not support major league sports.
When Los Angeles and San Francisco broke the coast-to-coast travel
barrier and were granted major league baseball franchises a few
vears a.u'o, the Texans proclaimed war..
With l()-gallon hats tilled roughly and cries of "Remember Ihe
Alamo" ringing in the background the light was on.
NOT FEARING probable financial losses last year, the Longhorn
state finally obtained major league franchises- two in football and
one in baseball for 1962.
The article below show-s more of the progress our Southern neigh
bors are making. The proposal passed last Tuesday.
HOUSTON HJPI) A fantastic dream of the sportsminded since
long before the great sports arenas of Rome were built is in sight
for Houston in Ihe city's proposed all-weather, domed stadium.
Next Home of a 'Beat Cal' Banner?
The $22,000,000 structure, which now needs only the approval]
of voters of the county in a special bond issue election to be held on
Tuesday, has been referred to as an attraction that might rival the
Eiffel Tower of Paris.
OTHERS HAVE spoken of it as a sort of added wonder of the
nation, alongside Yosemite National Park, or the Grand Canyon.
The proposed air-conditioned edifice is scheduled for completion
by April, 19(52, in time for Houston's National League baseball
squad to begin play as the first major league team in the Southwest.
The stadium will lie the first structure of its kind in the world.
A close look at some of its attractions reveals why it is referred
to by some as another wonder of the world. The structure will cover
nine and one-half acres of land with its 55,000 seats and playing field
completely roofed over.
GONE WILL BE the old plague of the baseball world—"post
poned. on account of rain."
The roof will be of translucent plastic to admit light during day
time hours and to admit the necessary sun rays to grow grass. The
clear span dome roof will be 642 feet with the outside diameter 712
feet. There will be no supporting columns to obstruct views.
The height of the roof above Ihe playing field will be 202 feet, or
tall enough to house an 18-story building. The entire stadium will be
air-conditioned with 5,000 tons cooling capacity and circulating 2,000,-
000 cubic-feet of air each minute.
Housed in the stadium will be offices of the Houston Sports As
sociation, the owners of the National League franchise; the offices
of the Houston Oilers of the American Football League; and the
offices of the County Stadium management.
SPACIOUS PRESS accommodations with separate press box lo
cat ions for football and baseball will be included. There also will be
TV and radio control rooms, workrooms, darkrooms, interviewing
rooms and a snack bar in the press section.
For the fans, there will be a cafeteria, a gourmet-type restaurant
for "delux dining" with tables overlooking the playing field similar
to clubs found at race tracks, and snack bars and rest rooms at each
seating level.
There also will be separate locker room facilities for both pro
fessional and non-professional football and baseball teams; dressing
rooms for entertainers, ushers, etc., and first aid stations.
For football, the usual dirt areas on a baseball diamond will be
sodded over to form an all grass playing field. Seating can be ar
ranged to accommodate any type of sport or meeting from rodeos
to national political conventions.
A Press of a Button
To convert from baseball to football seating, a press of a button
v. ii! move stands of 10,000 seats around on steel rails until they paral
lel the football sidelines.
The stadium is so designed that spectators will enter at about
the mid-level of seating and proceed either up or down on wide, low-

'.rarliont ramps.
The radius point of all rows of
Renting on ihc six levels is second ,
b.iso on the baseball diamond.
This means that 1he seats in the
centerfield stands will be just as
close to the center of action as
some of the best seats back of
home plate. All seats will face the
renter of the playing area, and
every seat will have a chairback.
There will be other features,
and to name them all would take
much more space. But this in a
nutshell is some of the spectacular
statistics of what will he the
world's i irst domed, all-weather
sports arena.

HOUSTON HJPI) A fantastic dream of the sportsminded since
long before the great sports arenas of Rome were built is in sight
for Houston in Ihe city's proposed all-weather, domed stadium.
Next Home of a 'Beat Cal' Banner?
The $22,000,000 structure, which now needs only the approval]
of voters of the county in a special bond issue election to be held on
Tuesday, has been referred to as an attraction that might rival the
Eiffel Tower of Paris.
OTHERS HAVE spoken of it as a sort of added wonder of the
nation, alongside Yosemite National Park, or the Grand Canyon.
The proposed air-conditioned edifice is scheduled for completion
by April, 19(52, in time for Houston's National League baseball
squad to begin play as the first major league team in the Southwest.
The stadium will lie the first structure of its kind in the world.
A close look at some of its attractions reveals why it is referred
to by some as another wonder of the world. The structure will cover
nine and one-half acres of land with its 55,000 seats and playing field
completely roofed over.
GONE WILL BE the old plague of the baseball world—"post
poned. on account of rain."
The roof will be of translucent plastic to admit light during day
time hours and to admit the necessary sun rays to grow grass. The
clear span dome roof will be 642 feet with the outside diameter 712
feet. There will be no supporting columns to obstruct views.
The height of the roof above Ihe playing field will be 202 feet, or
tall enough to house an 18-story building. The entire stadium will be
air-conditioned with 5,000 tons cooling capacity and circulating 2,000,-
000 cubic-feet of air each minute.
Housed in the stadium will be offices of the Houston Sports As
sociation, the owners of the National League franchise; the offices
of the Houston Oilers of the American Football League; and the
offices of the County Stadium management.
SPACIOUS PRESS accommodations with separate press box lo
cat ions for football and baseball will be included. There also will be
TV and radio control rooms, workrooms, darkrooms, interviewing
rooms and a snack bar in the press section.
For the fans, there will be a cafeteria, a gourmet-type restaurant
for "delux dining" with tables overlooking the playing field similar
to clubs found at race tracks, and snack bars and rest rooms at each
seating level.
There also will be separate locker room facilities for both pro
fessional and non-professional football and baseball teams; dressing
rooms for entertainers, ushers, etc., and first aid stations.
For football, the usual dirt areas on a baseball diamond will be
sodded over to form an all grass playing field. Seating can be ar
ranged to accommodate any type of sport or meeting from rodeos
to national political conventions.
A Press of a Button
To convert from baseball to football seating, a press of a button
v. ii! move stands of 10,000 seats around on steel rails until they paral

The stadium is so designed that spectators will enter at about
the mid-level of seating and proceed either up or down on wide, low-

HOUSTON HJPI) A fantastic dream of the sportsminded since
long before the great sports arenas of Rome were built is in sight
for Houston in Ihe city's proposed all-weather, domed stadium.
Next Home of a 'Beat Cal' Banner?
The $22,000,000 structure, which now needs only the approval]
of voters of the county in a special bond issue election to be held on
Tuesday, has been referred to as an attraction that might rival the
Eiffel Tower of Paris.
OTHERS HAVE spoken of it as a sort of added wonder of the
nation, alongside Yosemite National Park, or the Grand Canyon.
The proposed air-conditioned edifice is scheduled for completion
by April, 19(52, in time for Houston's National League baseball
squad to begin play as the first major league team in the Southwest.
The stadium will lie the first structure of its kind in the world.
A close look at some of its attractions reveals why it is referred
to by some as another wonder of the world. The structure will cover
nine and one-half acres of land with its 55,000 seats and playing field
completely roofed over.
GONE WILL BE the old plague of the baseball world—"post
poned. on account of rain."
The roof will be of translucent plastic to admit light during day
time hours and to admit the necessary sun rays to grow grass. The
clear span dome roof will be 642 feet with the outside diameter 712
feet. There will be no supporting columns to obstruct views.
The height of the roof above Ihe playing field will be 202 feet, or
tall enough to house an 18-story building. The entire stadium will be
air-conditioned with 5,000 tons cooling capacity and circulating 2,000,-
000 cubic-feet of air each minute.
Housed in the stadium will be offices of the Houston Sports As
sociation, the owners of the National League franchise; the offices
of the Houston Oilers of the American Football League; and the
offices of the County Stadium management.
SPACIOUS PRESS accommodations with separate press box lo
cat ions for football and baseball will be included. There also will be
TV and radio control rooms, workrooms, darkrooms, interviewing
rooms and a snack bar in the press section.
For the fans, there will be a cafeteria, a gourmet-type restaurant
for "delux dining" with tables overlooking the playing field similar
to clubs found at race tracks, and snack bars and rest rooms at each
seating level.
There also will be separate locker room facilities for both pro
fessional and non-professional football and baseball teams; dressing
rooms for entertainers, ushers, etc., and first aid stations.
For football, the usual dirt areas on a baseball diamond will be
sodded over to form an all grass playing field. Seating can be ar
ranged to accommodate any type of sport or meeting from rodeos
to national political conventions.
