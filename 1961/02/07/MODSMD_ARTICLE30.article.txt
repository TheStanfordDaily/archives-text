# Stone Rubbings Show at Museum
## 
### 
An exhibit of "stone rubbings"
taken from the sandstone reliefs
at Angkor Wat will be extended
through Feb. 26 at the Stanford
Museum.
The rubbings were made by a
process comparable to transfer
ring the design of a coin to paper
by rubbing it with pencil, under
the supervision of the Cultural
Center of Angkor, Cambodia.
Angkor Wat is the great tem
ple of the ancient Khymer Em
pire, a culture which dominated
the Indochinese peninsula from
the 9th to 13th centuries.
It was abandoned in the 1.400'5,
rediscovered in 1861, and restored
in large part by French scholars, i
The Museum is open daily from
1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free.
