# Class Criticism By Students at Oxford Halted
## 
### 
LONDON (UPD — Oxford
University —to the probable
relief of college professors all
over the world — last week
clamped down on a student
magazine's plan to review
lectures as critically as if
they were films or books.
The words "censored by the
protectors" appeared on an
otherwise blank page of the
undergraduate magazine Isis
for which student critics had
prepared commentaries on
three of the week's lessons.
The proctors — university
officials acted quickly after
Isis earlier had published re
views of five lectures, two of
which were harshly panned
and one of which was criti
cized more mildly. The other
two got what might be called
good notices.
The editor of Isis, Paul
Foot, 23, son of Sir Hugh
Foot, former governor of Cy
prus, said lie started the re
views because there are too
many lectures, the standard is
far too low and teachers tend
to become careless just as
actors or writers might do if
there were no critics to goad
them.
