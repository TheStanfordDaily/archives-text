William G. Craig and Stern fac
ulty resident Wilfred H. Stone.
"The initiative for this discus
sion came from the freshman men
themselves," stated Wilbur head
sponsor Rich Hawkins.
"The same committee that in
vestigated discrimination in the
fraternity houses decided that
freshmen should have a chance to
hear all sides of the question dis
cussed at once and have a chance
to ask questions of the faculty.
Freshmen have to evaluate their
goals in college and then make a
decision as to where to live," he
added.
The discussion this evening is in
conjunction with the eating club
open houses Thursday and Fri
day this week and Greek Week
open houses at the fraternities
next week.
