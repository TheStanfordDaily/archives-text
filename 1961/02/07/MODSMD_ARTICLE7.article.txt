# Storm Hits Panhandle
## 
### UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
A new storm got stuck over the
Texas-Oklahoma Panhandle last
night, sparing the winter-weary
Eastern Seaboard from another
full-blown onslaught of ice and
snow.
Snow w ami ng Â« remained
posted, however, for New York
and other cities struggling to
break loose from some of the
heaviest snows in decades.
WEATHERMEN also foresaw
the possibility of a new eastward
driving snowstorm if a storm sys
tem in the western Gulf of Mexico
gets together with a low pressure
system over the southwest.
The latest storm threatened
new misery for the East when it
plastered parts of Kansas with
up to eight inches of snow and
laid down an ice coating south of
a line stretching east of Kansas
City. The storm couldn't get mov
ing, however, and was still poster
ing the Panhandle country with
moderate snows last night.
Warnings of up to seven inches
of snow in the Middle West were
revised.
EASTERNERS still kept an un
easy eye on the weather map.
Even though New York's fore
cast was for only light snows,
Golhamites remembered that the
prelude to the weekend near
blizzard was a forecast of just
four inches,
The great cities of the Atlantic
Seaboard were just beginning to
dig out from snows which were
blamed foi more than 100 death.;.
