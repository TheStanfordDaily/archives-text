## U.S. Should Lead And Follow Arabs 
### LINDA HESS 
"'America ma\ expect lu recapture respect and friendship from
Africa and Asia, hut not subservience. America ma\ expect to
lead. Imt must he prepared at times t«> follow. America ina\ ex
pect kinship, hut not alliance . .
These were the words of Fayez A. Sa\e«;h, visiting professor of

political science, who last night
addressed a large audience at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Describing the Arab world as
an accurate "yardstick of the
image America is projecting
abroad." Sayegh outlined the evo
lution of Arab nationalism and
the implications of Arab neutral
ism in the cold war.
THE PEOPLE of Africa and
Asia are "heartened by the spec
tacle of Americans being con
cerned at long last with what the
rest of the world things of them,"
but they tend to view most West
ern proposals with a suspicious
eye. The basis for this mistrust of
Western goals and methods is to
be found in a four-step evolution
which the Arab world has ex
perienced since" (he beginning of
the cold war.
In 1947 the East was of little or
no concern to the Arab mind. The
West, on the other hand, "was
present as a political force which
had done the Arab world much
harm in the past 40 years," he
said.
Since the end of World War I
England and France had "occu
pied and dismembered" the Arab
world. In addition, England had
"posed a new threat to Arab na
tionalism in the form of the Bal
four Declaration," Sayegh said.
America, by endorsing the dec
laration and fostering interna
tional Zionism, fell heir to the ill
will that had been building against
England for many years.
THE NEXT step in the progres
sion of Arab nationalism came in
1951. when the West presented
Egypt with the proposed Middle
East Treaty Organization. For a
number of years, British army oc
cupation had been a bone of con
tention between Egypt and Eng
land.
Now the West was proposing a
military alliance in the form of
METO which would firmly bind
the Arabs to a Western defense.
All this meant to the Egyptians
was a 'Ve-christening" of the
British troops under the banner
of METO. They had no desire for
such an alliance, he «aid.
The next decisive step came
with the advent of the Eisen
hower administration in 1952, ac
cording to Sayegh. Dulles' foreign
policy aroused a wave of antago
nism in the Middle East, and faced
with a "whoever isn't with me is
against me" attitude on the part
of Dulles, and deprived of U.S.
"aid and trade" because of then
refusal to join the Western pact,
the Arabs reacted by accepting
Soviet aid, he said.
IT IS AT THIS point that the
Arab world's "pragmatic neutral
ism" stands today, Sayegh said,
and described it as a more "se
date," but an unquestionably firm
stand, whose implications in the
world of the cold war arc broad
and significant. .
First, the Arab stand has
strengthened the importance of
Second, it has underlined the
necessity of refortifying the
United Nations, eliminating such
barriers to effective action as sec
ond-class members and the secur
ity council veto, promoting uni
versal membership, and increas
ing the U.N.'s power to enforce
its decisions, he said.
Third, Arab neutralism is a
symbol of opposition to those
"unnatural pacts" which are
aimed at increasing military se
curity, but inevitably result in
"creating maximum insecurity for
all."
FINALLY, and most impor
tantly in the eyes of Sayegh, Arab
neutralism presents a continuous
challenge to the United States, as
the leader of the Western World.
"America once represented uni
versal values and ideals, but she
turned her back on them. The
image she presented to the world
came to be one committed to
colonialism and status quo. and
opposed t<> revolution and national
sovereignty." Sayegh claimed.
Today America seems to be re
examining its policies in the light
of world opinion, Sayegh said, ex
pressing encouragement form
early indications of the new Ken
nedy administration. But. he
warned, America should not ex
peel miracles.
