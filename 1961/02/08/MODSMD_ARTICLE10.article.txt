# Vance Packard Speaks Today At Mem Aud
## 
### 
Vance Packard, author of three
best sellers in the last three
years, will speak on "The Chang
ing Character of the American
Peopleâ€”What Are the Waste-
Makers Doing to Us" tonight at
7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Packard's three best selling
books are "Hidden Persuaders,"
which explains the manipulation
of the American mind by psycho
logical advertising, "Status Seek
ers," which is an exploration of
class behavior and structure in
American society, and"The
Waste Makers."
TIIE range of opinion about
his books is shown by these two
comments about "The Status
Seekers." The Atlantic Monthly
says. "Unfortunately Mr. Pack
ard has handled a subject that
calls for subtlety and sophistica
tion in the manner of an Inno
cent who has just discovered the
prevalence of sin."
The opposite view is taken by
the reviewer of the New Repub
lic, who writes "I would like to
enter a strong vote of approval
for this work ... it documents
the pervasiveness of stratifica
tion in American Society."
TICKETS for Packard's speech
are on sale at Memorial Hall Box
Office. The price is $1.50 for the
general public and 75 cents for
students.
