# JFK Asks $1.25 Minimum Wage In Next 3 Years
## Plan to Cover More Workers 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPH Pits
| ident Kennedy asked Congress yes
terday to raise the $l-an-hour fed
eral minimum wage to $1.25 over
the next three years and extend
it to additional workers to pre
vent growth of an "under-privi
leged and under-paid class."
He favored a scries of annual
revisions in the wage level so em
ployers could more easily adjust
to the pay boosts. In the first
year, the proposed bill would pro
vide wage increases of $578 mil
lion for about 2.7 million workers.
THE PRESIDENT'S proposal
called for raising the wage floor
to $1.15 an hour this year for the
24 million workers already cov
ered. This would go up to $1.20 the
second year and then to $1.25.
The President also asked that
coverage be extended to 4.3 mil
lion workers, mostly in big retail
and service establishments. They
would start with a $l-an-hour
minimum wage, go up to $1.05 the
•second year, $1.15 the third year
and then to $1.25.
Chairman Adam Clayton
Powell, D-N.Y., of the House
Labor Committee said he hoped
Congress could complete action on
the bill by Easter. He named a
subcommittee headed by Rep.
James Roosevelt, D-Calif.. who in
troduced the Administration
measure, to open hearings Feb. 17.
THE SENATE last year ap
proved a 25-cent increase in the
wage floor and the House a 15-
cent boost. The legislation died
when Senate and House con
ferees were unable to agree on a
compromise.
The higher minimum. Kennedy
said in a message to House
Speaker Sam Rayburn, would be
achieved by a series of annual
rises "to which employment can
readily adjust itself."
"OUR NATION can ill-afford
1o tolerate the growth of an un
derprivileged and underpaid
class," the letter said.
'Substandard wages lead neces
sarily to substandard living con
ditions, hardships, and distress.
"SINCE THE last increase in
the minimum wage both living
costs and productivity have in
creased to such an extent that
the proposed bill merely reflects
an adjustment to keep pace with
Ihese factors."
The draft bill to amend the
Fair Labor Standards Act spells
out the minimum wage proposals
Kennedy recommended in his
anti-recession and economic policy
message to Congress on Feb. 2.
A NUMBER of business organ
izations are already gearing for
a fight against minimum wage ex
pansion. particularly the remov
ing of present coverage exemp
tions.
The proposed bill is rumored to
pattern closely Kennedy's plan
which failed last year.
