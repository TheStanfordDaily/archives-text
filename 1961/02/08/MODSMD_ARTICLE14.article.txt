# GOP Congressmen Can Lead Party
## 
### 
It is reassuring to note that the 22 Republican Congressmen
who sided with Democrat Sam in last week's fight over
the Rules Committee vote will not be punished for giving the
Speaker the margin of victory in a close 217 to 212 vote.
Republican House Whip Leslie C. Arends stated that the Re
publican leadership had no plan to purge the 22 from their present
committee assignments or to deny them the assignments they want.
This is good news since most of these 22 were newer Republi
can representatives, including five freshman members.
They perhaps signify a breakaway from the Smith-Halleck oppo
sition block of Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans whose
tactics of blanket opposition of the Kennedy program could, in the
long run, send the Republican party into a long-run minority exile.
We are not doubting the sincerity of those conservatives of both
parties who actually feared a "packing" of the Rules Committee
similar to Franklin Roosevelt's ill-fated Supreme Court bill. What
we do oppose is the leading of the Republican party on a path of
blind obstructionism to the whole Kennedy platform by the reac
tionary section of the House Democrats under the leadership of
Rules Committee Chairman Howard Smith of Virginia.
The Republican party must criticize tfas Kennedy program. It is
not only its right, but its duty as the minority party. But let us
make this criticism a selective one, judging each item on the slate
of the new administration on its own merits, rather than on the
grounds that it is just "another Kennedy proposal."
To follow the Southern Democrats down a path of blind oppo
sition will only have two results. The liberal Rockefeller-Dillon-
Case type of Republicans will gradualy forsake the Repubican
party for the Democratic, for ideoogical differences between this
brand of Republicanism and the Kennedy program are not great.
The Republican conservatives will then be left dry on the sands
of the minority beach.
The 22 Republicans who sided with the administration on the
rules vote point towards a higher guality, more intelligent opposi
tion. We hope other Republican leaders both inside and outside
Congress will follow their lead.
