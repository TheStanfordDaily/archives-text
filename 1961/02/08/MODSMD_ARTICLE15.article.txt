John F. Kennedy's task as United States President is, to make a
colossal understatement, difficult. President Janio Quadros' task in
Brazil is at least as difficult.
The United States is having a recession; Brazil is in the throes
of a runaway inflation. The American budget, gold reserves, ex
ternal debt and labor problems are all worrisome. In Brazil these
same problems are staggering.
The parallels cannot be carried too far because Brazil is not the
United States and Brazilians are not North Americans. Brazil, in
fact, defies classification, just as she has defied all the rules of
orthodox economy and thus far got away with it. President Kubits
chek, whose term has ended, believed in the more physical law of
momentum—keep going fast enough and you will not be pulled
down by gravity. Thus, he built the new capital of Brasilia in a
place that did not exist on the map with resources that he conjured
up out of the printing presses. Industrialization took a similarly
dizzy course. In agriculture, those who grew coffee were rewarded,
so that this year's coffee crop would supply the world—except that
the world will not buy it. Otherwise the farmer and the rural laborer
is in distress. So is the urban proletariat in the slums of Rio de
Janeiro, Sao Paulo and other cities.
It has been a grand and glorious spree, made possible by the
fact that Brazil was endowed by Providence with a generally fertile
soil, fabulous mineral wealth and a wonderful race of people who
can live on air, optimism and promises.
The day of reckoning has been left to Janio da Silva Quadros,
who now takes over. He is an extraordinary person with extraor
dinary gifts. As The Times correspondent Tad Szulc wrote, Janio
Quadros set out to be all things to all men, and if any Brazilian
can be that successfully, it will be he. Thus far, he has kept his
cards close to his chest. No one knows what he is going to do or
how he will do it, but there are great intelligence and great ability
in the new President. With such a man, Brazilians have reason to
hope. Certainly, he takes office with the best wishes of all of us,
for himself and for his remarkable country, which is a traditional
friend of the United States.

cards close to his chest. No one knows what he is going to do or
how he will do it, but there are great intelligence and great ability
in the new President. With such a man, Brazilians have reason to
hope. Certainly, he takes office with the best wishes of all of us,
for himself and for his remarkable country, which is a traditional
friend of the United States.
The New York Times
John F. Kennedy's task as United States President is, to make a
colossal understatement, difficult. President Janio Quadros' task in
Brazil is at least as difficult.
The United States is having a recession; Brazil is in the throes
of a runaway inflation. The American budget, gold reserves, ex
ternal debt and labor problems are all worrisome. In Brazil these
same problems are staggering.
The parallels cannot be carried too far because Brazil is not the
United States and Brazilians are not North Americans. Brazil, in
fact, defies classification, just as she has defied all the rules of
orthodox economy and thus far got away with it. President Kubits
chek, whose term has ended, believed in the more physical law of
momentum—keep going fast enough and you will not be pulled
down by gravity. Thus, he built the new capital of Brasilia in a
place that did not exist on the map with resources that he conjured
up out of the printing presses. Industrialization took a similarly
dizzy course. In agriculture, those who grew coffee were rewarded,
so that this year's coffee crop would supply the world—except that
the world will not buy it. Otherwise the farmer and the rural laborer
is in distress. So is the urban proletariat in the slums of Rio de
Janeiro, Sao Paulo and other cities.
It has been a grand and glorious spree, made possible by the
fact that Brazil was endowed by Providence with a generally fertile
soil, fabulous mineral wealth and a wonderful race of people who
can live on air, optimism and promises.
The day of reckoning has been left to Janio da Silva Quadros,
who now takes over. He is an extraordinary person with extraor
dinary gifts. As The Times correspondent Tad Szulc wrote, Janio
Quadros set out to be all things to all men, and if any Brazilian
can be that successfully, it will be he. Thus far, he has kept his
cards close to his chest. No one knows what he is going to do or
how he will do it, but there are great intelligence and great ability
in the new President. With such a man, Brazilians have reason to
hope. Certainly, he takes office with the best wishes of all of us,
for himself and for his remarkable country, which is a traditional
friend of the United States.
