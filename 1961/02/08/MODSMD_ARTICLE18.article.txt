## Active Students Replace Former Apathy Rioters 
### KEEM STASSEN 
The apathy riot is gone for
good. It used to he that students
at Wesleyan University in Con
necticut talked about publicly
protesting apathy by standing on
street corners with their hands in
their pockets and their mouths
shut. This they termed an "Apa
thy Riot."
Lately the apathy riot has been
replaced by countless student
groups that are interested in
something, although that some
thing often is not what older
apathy protesters had in mind.

Harold Taylor,
former president
of Sarah Law
ren c e College,
critically
summed up the
present attitude
of the older gen
erations for the
New York Time*
on Jan. 29.
"VVE II AV E
treated our stu-

dents as adolescent members of
their generation unready for the
responsibilities of citizenship and
political involvement.
"We have thought of education
as a system of taking courses in
a congenial and bland environ
ment. The public has then felt
free to criticize the students for
not working harder, for not be
lieving more, for not showing the
Russians that our system is
better.
"On the other hand, whenever
the students on our campuses
have bccome involved in political
and social issues, we have been
anxious that they might be sub
verted by unseen hands, or that a
visiting speaker might corrupt
them with a single radical talk."
FRENCH students have never
had an apathy problem. They are
the classical examples of perpet
ual movement and riot. The
French student when he saw "Op
eration Abolition" in Cubberley
Auditorium is typical of the
French opinion of American stu
dents. "I had to laugh, it was so
funny," he explained. "You Amer
icans just don't know how to con
duct a real riot."
He is right, but we are learning.
In our own awkward American
way we are learning to protest
lunch counter segregation, the
loyalty oath in the National De
fense Education Act, the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee, compulsory ROTC. the United
States penal system, withdrawal
of recognition from Cuba, and the
nuclear arms policy.
American students are learning
to do more than protest. Theiv is
large and growing support for
Kennedy, Nixon, Stevenson, and
Goldwater. ;is well as larire sin-

I dent protest against each of Ihese
1 men. The Youth Peace Corps
plan has already stimulated the
imagination and Ihe action of stu
denls across the country. Harvard
I had 3.1 D applications for 20 teach
; ing posts in Nigeria.
LAST VKAR a student group
at Yale formed Challenge, an or
ganization with the purpose of j
presenting seminars, study
groups, and weekend colloquia,
addressed by informed national
and international figures. This
sounds like a combination of Stan
ford's weekend hostels and the]
Political Union's Focus weeks.
Student, apathy is dying, but it
is not yet dead. The University
of Washington Daily lamented
the small attendence at a recent
International Roundtable presen
tation "which was designed to in
form concerned American stu
dents."
A LETTER to the Editor of
Übyssey, the paper of the Univer
sity of British Columbia, ex
pressed the sentiments of Ihe
frustrated apathetic student. "Do
you no! realize that apathy is the
very soul of freedom? Do you not
recognize that by refusing us Ihe
inherent freedom of motion, be
we dormant, dull, or sluggish, you
impose on us a regimentation far
more restraining than any police]
state?"
A later editorial in the ÜbyssPy
expressed a more prevalent stu
dent opinion. "To hell with your
grey flannel brains, sir. May you
continue to live on tranquilizers.
Three cheers for idealism, I say."
The apathy riot is dead. Let's
hope that it is not replaced by the
over-enthused and under-educated |
student, but by the concerned and
informed one.

The apathy riot is gone for
good. It used to he that students
at Wesleyan University in Con
necticut talked about publicly
protesting apathy by standing on
street corners with their hands in
their pockets and their mouths
shut. This they termed an "Apa
thy Riot."
Lately the apathy riot has been
replaced by countless student
groups that are interested in
something, although that some
thing often is not what older
apathy protesters had in mind.

Harold Taylor,
former president
of Sarah Law
ren c e College,
critically
summed up the
present attitude
of the older gen
erations for the
New York Time*
on Jan. 29.
"VVE II AV E
treated our stu-

dents as adolescent members of
their generation unready for the
responsibilities of citizenship and
political involvement.
"We have thought of education
as a system of taking courses in
a congenial and bland environ
ment. The public has then felt
free to criticize the students for
not working harder, for not be
lieving more, for not showing the
Russians that our system is
better.
"On the other hand, whenever
the students on our campuses
have bccome involved in political
and social issues, we have been
anxious that they might be sub
verted by unseen hands, or that a
visiting speaker might corrupt
them with a single radical talk."
FRENCH students have never
had an apathy problem. They are
the classical examples of perpet
ual movement and riot. The
French student when he saw "Op
eration Abolition" in Cubberley
Auditorium is typical of the
French opinion of American stu
dents. "I had to laugh, it was so
funny," he explained. "You Amer
icans just don't know how to con
duct a real riot."
He is right, but we are learning.
In our own awkward American
way we are learning to protest
lunch counter segregation, the
loyalty oath in the National De
fense Education Act, the House
Un-American Activities Commit
tee, compulsory ROTC. the United
States penal system, withdrawal
of recognition from Cuba, and the
nuclear arms policy.
American students are learning
to do more than protest. Theiv is
large and growing support for
Kennedy, Nixon, Stevenson, and
Goldwater. ;is well as larire sin-

I dent protest against each of Ihese
1 men. The Youth Peace Corps
plan has already stimulated the
imagination and Ihe action of stu
denls across the country. Harvard
I had 3.1 D applications for 20 teach
; ing posts in Nigeria.
LAST VKAR a student group
at Yale formed Challenge, an or
ganization with the purpose of j
presenting seminars, study
groups, and weekend colloquia,
addressed by informed national
and international figures. This
sounds like a combination of Stan
ford's weekend hostels and the]
Political Union's Focus weeks.
Student, apathy is dying, but it
is not yet dead. The University
of Washington Daily lamented
the small attendence at a recent
International Roundtable presen
tation "which was designed to in
form concerned American stu
dents."
A LETTER to the Editor of
Übyssey, the paper of the Univer
sity of British Columbia, ex
pressed the sentiments of Ihe
frustrated apathetic student. "Do
you no! realize that apathy is the
very soul of freedom? Do you not
recognize that by refusing us Ihe
inherent freedom of motion, be
we dormant, dull, or sluggish, you
impose on us a regimentation far
more restraining than any police]
state?"
A later editorial in the ÜbyssPy
expressed a more prevalent stu
dent opinion. "To hell with your
grey flannel brains, sir. May you
continue to live on tranquilizers.
Three cheers for idealism, I say."
The apathy riot is dead. Let's
hope that it is not replaced by the
over-enthused and under-educated |
