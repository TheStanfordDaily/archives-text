Up the Bay
Every afternoon 7!5 Stanford students pile into their cars, head
for the Redwood City Yacht Harbor 10 miles up the Bay, and so begin
a ritual that is repeated almost every day oi' the school year.
The To students are members of the Stanford crew; their daily
business is two hours of grueling workouts, part of a long, hard
preparation for a season that doesn't begin until early in April.
As crew captain Jon Loreen puts it, "We've been working on the
fundamentals of rowing from 4:30 until 6:30, six days a week, ever
since the first day of the quarter. Right now we have over eight
boats in the water, three and a half varsity crews and five frosh."

This is one of the largest turn
outs that Loreen, a four-year vet
eran on the team, can remember.
During Fall quarter the three
and a fraction varsity boats spent
more time on fundamentals, giv
ing the oarsmen a six-month
jump on the regular season.
THE REASON for all the prep
aration is in the sport itself. Row
ing is a matter of precision. All
eight oars must go into the water
at the same instant each oars
man must pull smoothly and
evenly to keep the 60-foot, rail
thin shell in perfect balance and
moving as quickly as possible.
The difference between a winning
and a losing crew can be the
width of an oar blade and that
difference is the result of just a
little added practice in the fall
and winter.
Rowing is one of the most pop-

ular collegiate sports among Eastern schools and also at Cal and
Washington on the West Coast. Crew is respected because of its tra
dition and because it retains a true amateur spirit, even when more
and more college sports are falling into the patterns of big busi
ness. Publicity agents, athletic directors and executive-type coaches
lure the paying fans who make major sports a financial success, but
crew still relies on student help.
At Stanford rowing is considered a minor, non-official sport. The
University contributes some money to the crew association's funds,
but not nearly enough to cover equipment costs or meet expenses.
Crew members usually pay their own traveling expenses and drive
their own cars to away races.
CREW ALUMNI chip in occasionally to ease the finances and it
was the old grads' donations that made the new boathouse at the
Redwood City headquarters possible. Still, it's always touch and
go to keep ahead of the problems.
''Last year for instance, against Cal," says Loreen, "we launched
from the mud. the dock was in such bad shape. At the moment it's
just bai-ely holding together. We hate to put any money in-it though,
because the channel i* going to be dredged and we may not get our
old location back."
Ciew faces a twofold battle: keeping ahead of the bills and trying
to stay ahead of the competitors. The first problem is handled by
the studentsâ€”the second is mainly in the hands of varsity Coach
Phil Waters.
Waters, who received an AB in French and a MS in physical edu
cation from Stanford, handles the Cards' coaching duties free of
.'-harge. Phil got his rowing experience as a member of the 1955
Stanford crew and previously coached the frosh boats, a job now
held by Conn Findlay.
Top Oarsman
FINDLAY IS ONE of the nation's top oarsmen, learning with
Stanford coxswain Kent Mitchell for a bronze medal in the Olympics
;it Rome last summer and winning a gold medal in the same event
in Melbourne in the 1956 Olympic Games.
In the past years the crew has usually done well enough against
most of the other boats on the coast. Stanford has always dominated
the Harbach Cup Regattas, a competition with USC and UCLA that
was organized in 1956 and runs until 1965.
The regatta works on a point system. Eight points are given to
the winner of the varsity race while second and third place finishes
are worth seven and six points, respectively. Freshman and JV races
are scored six, five and four on the same basis. After 10 years the
school with the highest total wins the Harbach Cup and the Cards
are currently more than 10 points ahead of either of the Southern
outfits.
AGAINST CAL AND Washington, though, the local powerhouses,
the Stanford eight has found the going a bit rougher. Stanford gen
erally finds themselves trailing the Husky and Bear rowers, some
times by embarrassingly large margins, and, the local crew has only ;
occassionally been able to dominate the national scene.
That doesn't stop the crew, however. They've got a big turnout 1
and this could be the season their fortunes change.
