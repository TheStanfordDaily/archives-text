Illustrated below is the membership pin of a brand-new national
fraternity called Signa Phi Nothing. To join Signa Phi Nothing
and got this hideous membership pin absolutely free, simply
take a pair of scissors and cut out the illustration and paste it
to your dickey.
Let me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining
Signa Phi Nothing. The only thing 1 recommend in this column
is Marlboro cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes a
filtered cigarette with an unfiltered taste, who yearns to settle
back and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, whose heart is quickened
by a choice of soft pack or flip-top box and who gets paid every
week for writing this column.
It is difficult to think of any reason why you should join
Signa Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by
nature; if you are one such 1 must toll you there arc any number
of better organizations than Signa Phi Nothing for you to join—
the -Mafia, for example.
Put if you should join Signa Phi Nothing, lot me give you
several warnings. First off, it is the only fraternity that admits
girls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new member im
mediately goes active. Perhaps "inactive" is a more accurate
term; there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, no sports,
no games, no dues, no grip, and no house.
The only thing Signa Phi Nothing has that other fraternities
have is a fraternity hymn, In fact, two hymns were submitted

to a rcccnt mooting of the national board of directors (hoilc of
whom attended). The first hymn goes:
Ilolchci, boop-boop-a-doop,
Mother's making blubber soup.
The second hymn is considerably longer:
A Guernsey's a cotu,
A road is a lane,
When you're eating chow,
Remember the viein!
Fending the next meeting of the national board of directors,
which will never be held, members arc authorized to sing either
hymn. Or, for that matter, Stardust.
Perhaps you arc asking why there should be such a fraternity
as Signa Phi Nothing. 1 will give you an answer—an answer
with which you cannot possibly disagree: <Signu Plii Nothing
Jills a well-needed gap.
Are you suffering from mental health? fs logic distorting
your thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth?
Are your long-cherished misapprehensions retreating before a
sea of facts? In short, has education caught up with you?
If so, congratulations. liut tell the truth—wouldn't you like
to make an occasional visit back to the good old days w hen you
were not so wise and composed and industrious—when you
were, in fact, nuttier than a fruitcake?
If you pine for those old familiar miasms, those dear, dead
vapors, join Higtia Phi Nothing and renew, for a fleeting
moment, your acquaintance with futility. We promise nothing,
and, by George, we deliver itl &mi M „ Bh uin..»

"THE SLOW RUSH"
Illustrated below is the membership pin of a brand-new national
fraternity called Signa Phi Nothing. To join Signa Phi Nothing
and got this hideous membership pin absolutely free, simply
take a pair of scissors and cut out the illustration and paste it
to your dickey.
Let me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining
Signa Phi Nothing. The only thing 1 recommend in this column
is Marlboro cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes a
filtered cigarette with an unfiltered taste, who yearns to settle
back and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, whose heart is quickened
by a choice of soft pack or flip-top box and who gets paid every
week for writing this column.
It is difficult to think of any reason why you should join
Signa Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by
nature; if you are one such 1 must toll you there arc any number
of better organizations than Signa Phi Nothing for you to join—
the -Mafia, for example.
Put if you should join Signa Phi Nothing, lot me give you
several warnings. First off, it is the only fraternity that admits
girls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new member im
mediately goes active. Perhaps "inactive" is a more accurate
term; there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, no sports,
no games, no dues, no grip, and no house.
The only thing Signa Phi Nothing has that other fraternities
have is a fraternity hymn, In fact, two hymns were submitted

to a rcccnt mooting of the national board of directors (hoilc of
whom attended). The first hymn goes:
Ilolchci, boop-boop-a-doop,
Mother's making blubber soup.
The second hymn is considerably longer:
A Guernsey's a cotu,
A road is a lane,
When you're eating chow,
Remember the viein!
Fending the next meeting of the national board of directors,
which will never be held, members arc authorized to sing either
hymn. Or, for that matter, Stardust.
Perhaps you arc asking why there should be such a fraternity
as Signa Phi Nothing. 1 will give you an answer—an answer
with which you cannot possibly disagree: <Signu Plii Nothing
Jills a well-needed gap.
Are you suffering from mental health? fs logic distorting
your thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth?
Are your long-cherished misapprehensions retreating before a
sea of facts? In short, has education caught up with you?
If so, congratulations. liut tell the truth—wouldn't you like
to make an occasional visit back to the good old days w hen you
were not so wise and composed and industrious—when you
were, in fact, nuttier than a fruitcake?
If you pine for those old familiar miasms, those dear, dead
vapors, join Higtia Phi Nothing and renew, for a fleeting
moment, your acquaintance with futility. We promise nothing,
and, by George, we deliver itl &mi M „ Bh uin..»
