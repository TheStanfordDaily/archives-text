# TONIGHT
## Students Who Visited Cuba to Hold Panel 
### 
Stanford and UC students who
visited Cuba shortly before the
break in diplomatic relations will
describe their experiences and
answer questions from the audi
ence in a panel discussion tonight
at 7:30 in the Physics Lecture
Hall. Slides taken by the students
will be shown before the panel
discusses its impressions of the
Cuban Revolutions.
With the break in diplomatic
relations last January came a
disruption in all direct communi
cation with the Cuban Revolu
tion. Shortly before the break
the students visited Cuba. Al- j
though most of them stayed less'
than a month they were able to
travel through much of Cuba and
witness many of the changes!
wrought by the revolution.
Joel Meister, '62. is chairman of '
the conference division of lIR
which planned the event. "Since j
direct communication with Cuba I
is now restricted." he said, "these j
recent observations are valuable
in gaining a clearer understand
ing of what is going on there."
Thomas F. Mayer, graduate
student, is assisting Meister with
arrangements.
Moderator will be Richard R.
White, med student. Stanford |
panelists will be Patrick B. Lu- ;
cas, '62, Keith Holleuffer, '62 and
Robert B. Hutchinson, '64.
