## Raul Castro Hurls Attack On Priests 
### 
| HAVANA (UPI) â€” Cuban De
i fense Minister Raul Castro said
j last night that a Catholic priest
I
I was wounded and captured as he
tried to blow up an ammunition
dump at the Managua Military
I Camp.
Castro, in a bitter attack on the
: Roman Catholic Church, said the
incident took place some months
ago. But he tempered his state
ments with a promise of "pa
tience" in dealing with the Church.
HE CHARGED that other
priests have transported or placed
bombs and that churches have
hidden deposits of dynamite and
printed counter - revolutionary
propaganda.
"But tell me of a single case
where we have acted," he said,
, aliiiough he added soldiers some-
I times had to "protect" priests
j from the angry populace.
"Don't worry, henchmen in cas*
j socks, we are going to look for
j more patience."
| Castro, addressing a rally of
pro-government students, said the
captured priest was treated for a
foot wound and the affair was
quieted.
Castro said Church officials
were informed of the incident and
asked that the priest be turned
i over to them for transfer out of
Cuba, which was done.
IN WHAT was interpreted as a
new and serious warning to the
; Church, Castro added: "As minis
: ter of the armed forces, I must in
form you (the Church) that our
generosity has reached its in
calculable limits. We have fin-
I ished with the imperialists and we
I have 112 in is h e d with the rural
| guards, and we haven't meddled
with the priests."
Castro, his shirt soaked by the
rain which fell throughout most
of his speech, repeated the gov
ernment charge that the Catholic
Church instigated the student
strike now gaining momentum in
the nation's schools.
The student rally he addressed
was called to counteract the strike
move. Most of his audience were
pro-government "young rebels."
