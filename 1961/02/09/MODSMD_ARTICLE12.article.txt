"I was overwhelmed by my welcome," was the
way Patrick Lucas summarized the feelings of the
five Bay Area students who visited Cuba to a near
capacity audience in the Physics Lecture Hall last
night.
His remark came after another visitor, Paul
Blumberg, of University of California, showed
slides demonstrating the remarkable building prog
ress made in Cuba since the revolution.
ALSO DISCUSSING their experiences and an
swering questions on the political, social and eco
nocim situation where Bob Hutchinson and Keith
Holleneffer of Stanford, and Robert Scheer of Cal.
They pointed out that before the revolution,
only a third of the children of school age were in
schools which were mostly over-crowded and inac
cessible to children in remote areas.
Over 10.()()() schools have been built since. In
Orlente Province, a school city under construction
has a capacity for 20,000 of the children from re
mote areas.
1961 has been designated the year of education.
Last \ear was the year of agrarian reform. Blum
berg showed slides of a huge New Year's Eve cele

bration by Castro and lO.bOO school teachers now
teaching in schools in remote areas. Not only chil
dren. but illiterate adults as well attend these
schools.
ALL T1IK visitors noted the presence of Cas
tro's slogans everywhere on beach umbrellas,
buildings, billboards, street banners, and rural
homes. Such sayings as "The Fatherland or Die."
"Be Alert," and "We will win," are especially
popular.
At an 11-hour parade on Jan. 2 celebrating the
aniversary of the revolution, a huge model of the
misguided missile from Cape Canaveral which
killed a cow in Oriente was brought out. The ac
companying banner read: "A Little Message for
the Cow-Killers from the Pentagon."
The students mentioned other revolutionary
reforms: the reduction of rents to one-half, and
their application to ownership; the construction of
huge housing developments, complete with thea
ters, recreation areas and hospitals, in Havana and
all over the island.
FOR Tin: most part, all available resources are
being exploited. All arable land is being used, and
most of the building materials come from the
island itself.
