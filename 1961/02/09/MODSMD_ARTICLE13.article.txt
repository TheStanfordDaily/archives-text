LAKE FOREST 111. ( UPI > - A
Jewish student was dropped from
a national fraternity at Lake
Forest College because of his "re
ligious background," a school of
ficial said yesterday.
DEAN OF Students Howard
I-loogesteger said the youth was
pledged to Phi Delta Theta last
November, but was depledged
around the first of the year by the
fraternity's national council.
However, Schiller still lives in
the fraternity house, the dean
said, as a social member.
Newly elected Stanford Phi Delt
President Jim Sherman, declined
to make a statement to The Daily
I last night. "I'd like some time to
i think it over and talk about it
| with the house," he said .
i The boy, David C. Schiller of
Chicago, refused to comment. His
mother, Edith, said he took the
action voluntarily.
"These are my friends," Schil
ler said, "and I don't want to say
anything about it."
William Graham Cole, president
of the college, expressed concern
over the incident.
A statement by a student-fac
ulty-trustee-alumni group, which
met with Cole, said the local chap
ter of Phi Delta Theta pledged
Schiller in the "hope that the mat
ter would be approved by the na
tion council . . . but this was not
! allowed.
"PRESIDENT Cole commended
the initial interest of the chapter
and expressed the hope that
the day will come soon when a
j group of students w ill take addi
i tional steps to permit them to
' choose their own members on a
campus," the statement said.
Hoogesteger said school offi
cials learned of the depledging
j only a few days ago.
