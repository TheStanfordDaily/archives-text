# Fraternities Entertain Foreigners
## 
### 
The Class of 1964 will shortly
make its first informal survey of'
Stanford fraternities. The recent
disavowal by the local ATO's of
the "Christian" clause in their
charter, conformance to which is
demanded by the national, indi
cates one of the several ways in
which Stanford fraternities are
raising their own stature in the
eyes of the campus.
In another area, however, three
fraternities, as well as five eating
clubs, three row houses, and three
University women's residences
and Madera at Wilbur have under
taken an equally important and
valuable project. Each week these
living groups entertain one or
more foreign students for dinner.
In several instances the occasional
invitation to a meal has developed
into a standing invitation to par
ticipate in all the living group's
activities. In other words, living
group "adopts" a foreign student.
Several living group s, having
adopted a foreign student, are
continuing to invite other foreign
students to meals on a regular
basis.
The point of this letter is to
indicate one aspect of residence
life, with special regard to fra
ternities. that is normally unmen
tioned during rushing. Most, fra
ternities have at one time or an
other had an ASSU scholar living
in. But the program described
here has not emanated from any
formally organized body; it is
rather a response to a recognition
by several undergraduates of the
benefits of association between
students of differing nationalities.
Not all fr&ternities have shown
sustained interest in having for
eign students as regular dinner
guests and as participants in
other house activities. Those
which have—Phi Kappa Sigma,
Sigma Nu, and Theta Chi—have
been inceasingly enthusiastic!
about the concept of bringing for
eign students into the living group
as important and valuable mem
bers. The popularity of the Over
seas Centers has certainly con
tributed to this spirit.
Not everyone is interested in
international affairs, and many
are indifferent to meeting foreign
students. But for frosh who do
have an interest in extending their
acquaintanceship with foreign
students, the possibilities for
meeting foreign students through i
membership in a fraternity are -
great. If one is curious about the 1
international interests of any j
given house, one need merely ask j
an active during rushing. The pur- :
pose of rushing is to familiarize!
the uninitiated with the ways and !
means of fraternity life, and one
of these is certainly association 1
with contemporaries from other
lands.
We hope this facet of fraternity ;
life will not be overlooked by the ,
frosh. We also hope that the suc
cess of the program will spread
to more and more of Stanford's i
fraternities.

formally organized body; it is
rather a response to a recognition
by several undergraduates of the
benefits of association between
students of differing nationalities.
Not all fr&ternities have shown
sustained interest in having for
eign students as regular dinner
guests and as participants in
other house activities. Those
which have—Phi Kappa Sigma,
Sigma Nu, and Theta Chi—have
been inceasingly enthusiastic!
about the concept of bringing for
eign students into the living group
as important and valuable mem
bers. The popularity of the Over
seas Centers has certainly con
tributed to this spirit.
Not everyone is interested in
international affairs, and many
are indifferent to meeting foreign
students. But for frosh who do
have an interest in extending their
acquaintanceship with foreign
students, the possibilities for
meeting foreign students through i
membership in a fraternity are -
great. If one is curious about the 1
international interests of any j
given house, one need merely ask j
an active during rushing. The pur- :
pose of rushing is to familiarize!
the uninitiated with the ways and !
means of fraternity life, and one
of these is certainly association 1
with contemporaries from other
lands.
We hope this facet of fraternity ;
life will not be overlooked by the ,
frosh. We also hope that the suc
cess of the program will spread
to more and more of Stanford's i
fraternities.

The Class of 1964 will shortly
make its first informal survey of'
Stanford fraternities. The recent
disavowal by the local ATO's of
the "Christian" clause in their
charter, conformance to which is
demanded by the national, indi
cates one of the several ways in
which Stanford fraternities are
raising their own stature in the
eyes of the campus.
In another area, however, three
fraternities, as well as five eating
clubs, three row houses, and three
University women's residences
and Madera at Wilbur have under
taken an equally important and
valuable project. Each week these
living groups entertain one or
more foreign students for dinner.
In several instances the occasional
invitation to a meal has developed
into a standing invitation to par
ticipate in all the living group's
activities. In other words, living
group "adopts" a foreign student.
Several living group s, having
adopted a foreign student, are
continuing to invite other foreign
students to meals on a regular
basis.
The point of this letter is to
indicate one aspect of residence
life, with special regard to fra
ternities. that is normally unmen
tioned during rushing. Most, fra
ternities have at one time or an
other had an ASSU scholar living
in. But the program described
here has not emanated from any
formally organized body; it is
rather a response to a recognition
by several undergraduates of the
benefits of association between
