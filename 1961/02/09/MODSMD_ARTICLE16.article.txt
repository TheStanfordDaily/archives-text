# Urges Building Of Bomb Cellar For Stanford
## 
### 
The Associated Press reports
that a New Mexico town has built
a 600 pupil elementary school
underground and stocked it with
enough food to supply all 2,200
pupils of the district for two
weeks.
I suggest that the tunnel for
the Project-M accelerator be made
large enough to shelter the Stan
ford student body (admission by
reg. card only). Actually, it is
very unlikely that there would be
sufficient warning of an attack
for more than a few people to
reach the shelter in time. To be
safe, the whole University should
go underground, including the
football stadium.
After Stanford has been taken
care of. we can put other valuable
projects underground, i.e., Lock
heed, Sylvania, Rossoti's, and last,
UC. All America will go under
ground, and people will be paid a
bonus for doing essential work
above ground (such as farming).
If this does not appeal to you,
let President Kennedy know that
you are for disarmament with in
spection and against furnishing
NATO with nuclear weapons. If
we furnish NATO with nuclear
weapons, Russia will probably
furnish Cuba with them. If the
present arms race continues, war
is inevitable, whether it is started
intentionally or accidentally.
In a nuclear war the winner
will be neither Communism nor
Democracy; it will be Cannibal
ism.
