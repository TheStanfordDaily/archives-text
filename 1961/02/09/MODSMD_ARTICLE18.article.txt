# DISCRIMINATION CLAUSE
## Issue Centers Around Right of Association 
### 
First let me lhank both you
and your staff for correctly print
ing rny letter. All words which
I capitalized were printed as such
and all quotation marks were in
serted as I had them. I appreciate
this courtesy.
With respect to my letter 1
have noticed the three articles in
the Stanford Daily and T would
like to answer them. The articles
being the letters from Peter Sloss
and Lin Jensen and Ihe editorial
"Is There a place?"
Mr. Sloss asks in his letter,
"Why, then, does he suggest that
the Beta Psi Chapter lose its
charter for believing In his
ideas?" If I left 1 his impression
I apologize. I do not suggest that
Beta Psi lose its charter for be
lieving in my ideas. I do suggest
that Beta Psi lose its charter for
breaking the rules of the consti
tution of the national fraternity
which they had promised to up
hold.
The editorial, "Is There a
Place?", and Lin Jensen's letter
are, I feel, well-founded construc
tive criticism. My presentation of
the Right of Association was in
adequate. I shall now try 1o
clarify it.
As Americans we chose our
companions. The way we chose
them is left entirely up to each
of us as individuals. Some ppople
chose their friends because of
race, creed, or color; others use
such things as personal merit,
but in all cases the criterion is
left up to the individual. I wanl
this criterion left up to Ihe indi
vidual this is his God-given

right. With regard to those who
use such artificial things as race,
color, or creed, I feel they are
wrong. As an American I am ob
ligated to try to correct them by
Education NOT BY BREAK
ING MY PROMISE. I cannot
deny anyone the right to chose
their own standards for personal
association.
I hope that T have adequately
expressed ihe difference between
the Right of Association and dis
crimination. Discrimination is a
misuse of the Right of Associa
tion, but this does not mean the
right of association because it
was misused should be denied
anymore than we should deny
freedom of speech because some
one misused it.

the Beta Psi Chapter lose its
charter for believing In his
ideas?" If I left 1 his impression
I apologize. I do not suggest that
Beta Psi lose its charter for be
lieving in my ideas. I do suggest
that Beta Psi lose its charter for
breaking the rules of the consti
tution of the national fraternity
which they had promised to up
hold.
The editorial, "Is There a
Place?", and Lin Jensen's letter
are, I feel, well-founded construc
tive criticism. My presentation of
the Right of Association was in
adequate. I shall now try 1o
clarify it.
As Americans we chose our
companions. The way we chose
them is left entirely up to each
of us as individuals. Some ppople
chose their friends because of
race, creed, or color; others use
such things as personal merit,
but in all cases the criterion is
left up to the individual. I wanl
this criterion left up to Ihe indi
vidual this is his God-given

right. With regard to those who
use such artificial things as race,
color, or creed, I feel they are
wrong. As an American I am ob
ligated to try to correct them by
Education NOT BY BREAK
ING MY PROMISE. I cannot
deny anyone the right to chose
their own standards for personal
association.
I hope that T have adequately
expressed ihe difference between
the Right of Association and dis
crimination. Discrimination is a
misuse of the Right of Associa
tion, but this does not mean the
right of association because it
was misused should be denied
anymore than we should deny
freedom of speech because some
one misused it.

First let me lhank both you
and your staff for correctly print
ing rny letter. All words which
I capitalized were printed as such
and all quotation marks were in
serted as I had them. I appreciate
this courtesy.
With respect to my letter 1
have noticed the three articles in
the Stanford Daily and T would
like to answer them. The articles
being the letters from Peter Sloss
and Lin Jensen and Ihe editorial
"Is There a place?"
Mr. Sloss asks in his letter,
"Why, then, does he suggest that
the Beta Psi Chapter lose its
charter for believing In his
ideas?" If I left 1 his impression
I apologize. I do not suggest that
Beta Psi lose its charter for be
lieving in my ideas. I do suggest
that Beta Psi lose its charter for
breaking the rules of the consti
tution of the national fraternity
which they had promised to up
hold.
