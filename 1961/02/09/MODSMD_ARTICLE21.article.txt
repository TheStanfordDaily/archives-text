# Clarifies Nazi Rally
## 
### 
Miss Strelitz (Let's Throw a
Big Nazi Rally" I missed the point
of Mayor Wagner's refusal to al
low American Nazi leader Rock
well to conduct a rally in New
York. Neither he nor anyone else
involved seriously fears that such
a rally would turn "the city into
a screaming mob" of pro-Nazis.
Although it is perhaps well to re
member, in 1 his era of preoccupa
tion with communism, that the
American Nazi Party was able to
command a large following in its
rallies in Madison Square Garden
and elsewhere before WW 11. Cer
tainly the abominations commit
ted by the Nazis served to abro
gate enthusiasm for their "prin
ciples" here and to make anti-
Semitism far less fashionable
than than it was before the 1930'5;
still, we must recognize that a
certain degree of sub-surface sym
pathy for those "principles" exists
today even here. Thus the circula
tion of "Common Sense" is not
limited to Rockwell and his "2.1
supporters," and there is a dan
ger to our liberties although far
less clear and present from the
Right as well as from the Left.

The real reason for live refusal, j
however, was pointed out in Miss
Streiitz's last paragraph: "We'll
survive . . . but . . . Rockwell
won't." Being a eity with a popu
lation composed so greatly of as
sorted minority groups, New York
is hardly the healthiest place for
Rockwell to preach his gospel of
hate in public. He and his "storm
troopers" were mobbed the last
time they tried to conduct a rally
and were rescued by the local
police; his chances for survival in
New York, where Ihe memory of
Nazi atrocities is more firmly
fixed, could be assured only by
substantial and active police pro- j
tection. For Rockwell's own phys
ical safety (concern for which is
highly ironic in light of what he
suggests be done to those who j
disagree with him), and to pre
vent an almost certain riot, ihe
refusal to let ihe American
Fuhrer speak in Union Square is
justified.
Mr. Justice Holmes once said
that "most stringent protection of
free speech would not protect a
man in falsely shouting 'fire' in
a theater and causing a panic."

Nor, I submit, would it protect
t he "right" of a Nazi to conduct a
rally where the memory of his
predecessors' activities would be

substantially certain to provoke a
disturbance of the peace and phys
ical violence.
