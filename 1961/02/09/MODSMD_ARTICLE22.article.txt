# LEAGUE LEADERS INVADE FARM
## John Rudometkin Paces SC Daily Sports 
### KEN DERY Sports Editor 
The Trojans of USC, led byjiigh
scoring center John Rudometkin,
invade the Pavilion Friday night
hoping to increase their lead in
the AAWU basketball race.
Currenlly atop the Big Five
heap with a ."3-1 record and listed
sixth in this week's UPI rankings
the Trojans stand 15-3 overall.
WIIION THK season opened
there were few if any who thought
USC could even approach what
they have done. There were no
returning senior lettermen.
But the talented 6-6, 205-pound
Rudometkin has made fools of
the experts.
Showing tremendous potential
last year as a sophomore "Rudo,"
as he is known, led the Trojans in
almost all departments scoring,
most field goals, most free throws
and rebounds.
SO FAR this season the sensa
tion from Santa Maria has rock
eted into national prominence
through his points per game
average of 24.7 10th best in the
count ry.
In a fantastic display last week
end against cross-town rival
UCLA, John pumped in 64 points
in the two-game stand to leave
him just 19 markers shy of the
Trojan single season scoring rec
ord of 463 points set by Danny
Rogers in 1957.
But USC is not just a one-man
team. The starting forwards are
Verne Ashby and Ken Stanley
while handling the backcourt
chores are Chris Appol and Neil
Edwards.
APPKfi IS 6-2 and was truly
outstanding as a freshman two
years ago averaging 21 points
per game. Injuries slowed him
down last season but he has come
into his own and is the Trojans
second leading scorer with an 11.9
average.
Edwards (6-2) is scoring at a
9.8 clip and is one of the sharpest
shooting marksman the Trojans
have seen in quite awhile.
With Appel he gives the South

landers one of the strongest back
court combinations in the West.
Ken Stanley, at forward, has
developed very rapidly this sea
son and currenlly is the team's
third leading point producer. At
6-5 he is big but very agile.

, ROUNDING OUT the starting
five is Verne Ashby. Drawing a
i starting assignment for the first
time since early in the season last
Saturday, Ashby obliged with a
tremendous floor and backboard
game and contributed 13 points.

years ago averaging 21 points
per game. Injuries slowed him
down last season but he has come
into his own and is the Trojans
second leading scorer with an 11.9
average.
Edwards (6-2) is scoring at a
9.8 clip and is one of the sharpest
shooting marksman the Trojans
have seen in quite awhile.
With Appel he gives the South

landers one of the strongest back
court combinations in the West.
Ken Stanley, at forward, has
developed very rapidly this sea
son and currenlly is the team's
third leading point producer. At
6-5 he is big but very agile.

, ROUNDING OUT the starting
five is Verne Ashby. Drawing a
i starting assignment for the first
time since early in the season last
Saturday, Ashby obliged with a
tremendous floor and backboard
game and contributed 13 points.


TROJAN CENTER JOHN RUDOMETKIN

The Trojans of USC, led byjiigh
scoring center John Rudometkin,
invade the Pavilion Friday night
hoping to increase their lead in
the AAWU basketball race.
Currenlly atop the Big Five
heap with a ."3-1 record and listed
sixth in this week's UPI rankings
the Trojans stand 15-3 overall.
WIIION THK season opened
there were few if any who thought
USC could even approach what
they have done. There were no
returning senior lettermen.
But the talented 6-6, 205-pound
Rudometkin has made fools of
the experts.
Showing tremendous potential
last year as a sophomore "Rudo,"
as he is known, led the Trojans in
almost all departments scoring,
most field goals, most free throws
and rebounds.
SO FAR this season the sensa
tion from Santa Maria has rock
eted into national prominence
through his points per game
average of 24.7 10th best in the
count ry.
In a fantastic display last week
end against cross-town rival
UCLA, John pumped in 64 points
in the two-game stand to leave
him just 19 markers shy of the
Trojan single season scoring rec
ord of 463 points set by Danny
Rogers in 1957.
But USC is not just a one-man
team. The starting forwards are
Verne Ashby and Ken Stanley
while handling the backcourt
chores are Chris Appol and Neil
Edwards.
APPKfi IS 6-2 and was truly
outstanding as a freshman two
