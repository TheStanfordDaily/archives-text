league standing, but their poor
offensive and defensive showing
dropped the home team in every
one of the Big Five statistical
categories.

spot in team defense with a 57-
points per game average while
Stanford dropped to second place
by allowing one counter per game
more than the Bears.

game, 20 counters behind first

and free throws the locals dropped

worst department; the Reds are
solidly entrenched in the cellar,
pulling down 140 loose balls to
162 for the opponents.
ON THE individual side of the
ledger John Rudometkin has been
outstanding. The Southern Cal
center has scored 25.7 points per
game, more than seven points

Hanson of Washington.

among the league's top five in all
other categories free throws, re

has scored on .492 of his attempts
from the field. .857 of his tries
from the foul line and has gar
nered 64 rebounds.

Ledgerwood has been the most
effective Stanford rebounder,
gaining fourth ranking with 31
