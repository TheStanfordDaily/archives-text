# Papoose Hoopers Host Santa Rosa, San Jose
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford's Papoose roundball
ers will be looking to add another
pair of victories to their string of 1
successes when they take on
tough San Jose State and Santa !
Rosa Junior College Friday and
Saturday night in the Pavilion.
Tin; srAKTA\s have handed
Stanford one of their two season's
losses, 55-44, down at San Jose.'
Coach Bill Turner lays much of
the blame for the loss on Stanford
center Tom Dose's illness, and
the Indians will be trying to prove
that the defeat was a fluke.
Stanford will open with Ihe.
•same starting lineup that faced,
the Spartans two weeks ago. Lew
Shupe and Bob Ewing are at
guards. Shupe is one of the small
est basket bailers in ihe area at
5-9, and Ewing, 5-10, isn't much
taller. Shupe has been a leader all
season and has proved that he
can score from the outside.
Ewing replaced John Kennedy,
in the starting lineup after the
latter suffered an ankle injury.
Since Kennedy is three inches
taller than Ewing he will be
missed in' the starting lineup, as
Stanford can ill afford to lose the
little height they have at guard.
AT THE forwards are Rich j
Gritschke, 6-3, and 1 Toll is Moore,
j 6-4. Both have been outstanding j
i on defense and offense, helping to
make up for their lack of height
! with tremendous drive and spirit.
Tom Dose will start at center.
| Dose, at 6-7' is the only really
• tall man on the Frosh team. He
has been scoring at a clip of 20
points a game and hauling down
12 rebounds per contest. Twice he
has scored over 30 points in a
game, including 38 against Santa
; Clara. His 38-point effort is a
Stanford frosh record, breaking
the old record of 34 points, set by
Hank Luisetti in 1935 and tied by
Dose against St. Mary's earlier
this year.
San Jose has a tall team, with
no one in the starting lineup
under 6-2. At center is Harry Ed
wards, who stopped Dose with
four shots in ihe team's first en
j counter. Edwards resembles a
J marble pillar, at 6-8, 245. As a side
light. San Jose track fans have
been alerted that Edwards will be
the man to displace Dallas Long,
Bill Neider and Parry O'Brien as
I the next shot-put champion. SJS
track mentor Bud Winter thinks
I Edwards will top 70 feet.
THE OTHER starters are Mel
Simpson (6-5) and Bob Nye (6-6)
' at forwards, and Tom Nichols
' (6-4> and Craig Carpenter (6-2).
I San Jose Stale has a fine 9-2 rec
i ord, including a victory over
i Stanford, and decisions over Cal
and Santa Clara.
Saturday's opponent, Santa
Rosa, shouldn't be quite so tough
i as San Jose, but they are rated as

a very good ciub. They have two
outstanding prospects on their
starting five, conter John Paxton
and guard John Carnegie. Despite
their good rating, they were
dumped by San Mateo Jt\ 72-57,
in their last outing.

points a game and hauling down
12 rebounds per contest. Twice he
has scored over 30 points in a
game, including 38 against Santa

Stanford frosh record, breaking
the old record of 34 points, set by
Hank Luisetti in 1935 and tied by
Dose against St. Mary's earlier
this year.
San Jose has a tall team, with
no one in the starting lineup
under 6-2. At center is Harry Ed
wards, who stopped Dose with
four shots in ihe team's first en
j counter. Edwards resembles a
J marble pillar, at 6-8, 245. As a side
light. San Jose track fans have
been alerted that Edwards will be
the man to displace Dallas Long,
Bill Neider and Parry O'Brien as
I the next shot-put champion. SJS
track mentor Bud Winter thinks
I Edwards will top 70 feet.
THE OTHER starters are Mel
Simpson (6-5) and Bob Nye (6-6)
' at forwards, and Tom Nichols

I San Jose Stale has a fine 9-2 rec

Saturday's opponent, Santa
Rosa, shouldn't be quite so tough
i as San Jose, but they are rated as

a very good ciub. They have two
outstanding prospects on their
starting five, conter John Paxton
and guard John Carnegie. Despite
their good rating, they were
dumped by San Mateo Jt\ 72-57,
in their last outing.

Coach Bill Turner lays much of

center Tom Dose's illness, and
the Indians will be trying to prove
that the defeat was a fluke.
Stanford will open with Ihe.
•same starting lineup that faced,
the Spartans two weeks ago. Lew
Shupe and Bob Ewing are at
guards. Shupe is one of the small
est basket bailers in ihe area at
5-9, and Ewing, 5-10, isn't much
taller. Shupe has been a leader all
season and has proved that he
can score from the outside.
Ewing replaced John Kennedy,
in the starting lineup after the
latter suffered an ankle injury.
Since Kennedy is three inches
taller than Ewing he will be
missed in' the starting lineup, as
Stanford can ill afford to lose the
little height they have at guard.
AT THE forwards are Rich j
Gritschke, 6-3, and 1 Toll is Moore,

i on defense and offense, helping to
make up for their lack of height
