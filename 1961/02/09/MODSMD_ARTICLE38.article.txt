### 
WASHINGTON i I I'll— President keiinedv \esterda\ ruled out
nntil ut leu«t April the possibility of using tax cuts as an itllli
recession weapon. He advocated instead that (iongress enact
quickly the emergency proposals he lias recommended.
Tax cut legislation, said the President, could eost the Treasurv

from four to five billion dollars
and perhaps "limit our ability to
go ahead with other programs
which in the long run may be
more useful."
He summarized: "If you have a
tax cut, it may last six months—
if the Congress should grant it—
and you lose five billion dollars
which is put back into the econ
omy and expanded. With five bil
lion or three billion dollars de
voted to education or health or
international security, you can
produce a longer-range result."
The President emphasized that
he and his advisers would take an
otlier look at the economy in
April and "make a judgment at
that time" on whether an upturn
is in prospect for the spring or
summer.
In the meantime, he said. Con
gress should act on the proposals
he has marie for liberalizing job
less insurance payments, more aid
for depressed areas and increased
social security benefits.
The Joint Congressional Eco

lic hearings tomorrow on Ken

tions.
