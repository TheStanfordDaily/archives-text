### 
WASHINGTON (UPIt — The
Defense Department is investi
gating: whether there is a missile
gap which gives Russia a poten
tially dangerous lead over the
United States, President Kennedy
said yesterday.
The President also told his news
conference there is no evidence
the Soviets have placed a man in
orbit in their newly-launched
seven-ton •satellite.
KENNEDY added that the first
U.S. astronaut will not be hurled
into orbit until he has an excellent
chance for survival, "even if we
should come in second in putting
a man in space.
"We are very concerned that
we do not put a man in space in
order to gain some additional
prestige, and have a man take a
disproportionate risk." he said.
THE COMMENT on the missile
gap was in reply to a newsman's
statement that Defense Secretary
Robert S. McNamara was respon
sible for published reports saying
no such gap exists between the
United States and Russia.
Kenedy said, "It would be pre
mature to reach a judgment as to
whether there is a gap or not a
gap."
IF THE NATION is in danger,
he added, "I think it is important
that we know about it." He said
that if this should prove the case,
eh will advise Congress and rec
ommend "what needs to be done."
Earlier, Senate GOP leader
Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois said
the reports vindicated Eisen
hower.
