## 
### 
"Waltz of the Toreadors,"
which has been termed one of
the Stanford Players' finest
productions in recent years,
will continue its limited run
today, tomorrow and Satur
day.
The play, described as both
savage and farcical, opened
last Friday in Memorial Au
ditorium. Tickets are on sale
at Memorial Auditorium Box
Office, priced at $1.25, $2, and
$2.50.
