Vance I aekard explained to a capacity audience in Memorial
Auditorinni las! night. "This is a result of I lie fact that we are
being deliberate!) and systematically encouraged to be hedonist*."
In his criticism of conunerciaJ materialism in the United States,

| tlie noted author said that "there
is a danger that the American will
i become homogenized,, hypnotized,
standardized, and sterilized."
PACKARD EXPLAINED num
. erous methods the advertising and
I the business worlds use to encour-
I age the American consumer to
I buy more.
Foremost of these is the "itch
i for newness" which Madison Avc
; nue men try to create in each in
dividual. "Advertising men call
I themselves 'merchants of discon
| tent,' " Packard reported.
"MANUI A< TUHEKS produce
merchandise that will break down
just about the time you have paid
your last installment," according
to the best-selling author. This is
one kind of "planned obsoles
; cence." Another example is wo
men's ever changing clothes
styles.
Impulsiveness, a craving for
the instant product, and an urge
to throw things away are all de
liberately encouraged, Packard
warned. "Tomorrow even our
lives will be disposable," he said.
THE TEENAGE MARKET is
one of the fastest growing fields
of advertising because "youth are
more easily manipulated, more re
ceptive to new ideas, and are
forming patterns for life," Pack
ard explained.
"For example, hundreds of
thousands of brassieres were
sold to nine and ten year old
youngsters last year. This is one
of the most remarkable market
achievements of our time," he
stated.
BANKERS ARE part of the
campaign to make Americans
spend more money on what we
! do not need. "People are encour
j aged to make a habit of living
I beyond their means. Buying on
j the never-never teaches people to
be less critical and more free with
money," Packard declared.
The sociologist also deplored
the exploitation of our holidays.
"I saw a Valentine's Day sign out
side a New York store that said
'How do I love thee, let me show
you how.' Under the sign was a
display of mink coats and ladies'
lingerie."
PACKARD'S talk ended on a
positive note. "The question we
face is essentially a spiritual one:
What kind of life are we going
to build with all the resources we
have?" he asked.
j "We ought to think through the
impact of all this materialism on
our life. We ought to develop a
philosophy of life which does not
have self-indulgence as its goal,"
Packard concluded.
Packard described his Stanford
audience as the "largest and most
distinguished" he has ever ad
dressed.

THE TEENAGE MARKET is
one of the fastest growing fields
of advertising because "youth are
more easily manipulated, more re
ceptive to new ideas, and are
forming patterns for life," Pack
ard explained.
"For example, hundreds of
thousands of brassieres were
sold to nine and ten year old
youngsters last year. This is one
of the most remarkable market
achievements of our time," he
stated.
BANKERS ARE part of the
campaign to make Americans
spend more money on what we
! do not need. "People are encour
j aged to make a habit of living
I beyond their means. Buying on
j the never-never teaches people to
be less critical and more free with
money," Packard declared.
The sociologist also deplored
the exploitation of our holidays.
"I saw a Valentine's Day sign out
side a New York store that said
'How do I love thee, let me show
you how.' Under the sign was a
display of mink coats and ladies'
lingerie."
PACKARD'S talk ended on a
positive note. "The question we
face is essentially a spiritual one:
What kind of life are we going
to build with all the resources we
have?" he asked.
j "We ought to think through the
impact of all this materialism on
our life. We ought to develop a
philosophy of life which does not
have self-indulgence as its goal,"
Packard concluded.
Packard described his Stanford
audience as the "largest and most
distinguished" he has ever ad
dressed.
