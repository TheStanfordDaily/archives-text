In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
