## The 						Pressures on College Girls Today

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.

dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned

Perhaps for the first time in

is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop

other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog

havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.

in authority, partly by the desire

Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of

can encourage self-acceptance and

can add to the meaningfulness of

And the choice of new members

last a lifetime.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment

not too quickly flag.

confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,

Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low

actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on

failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac

source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their

We should recognize them for

young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.

ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.

however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.

be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is

Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective

super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex

well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.

They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.
Intellectual Strike
The reaction of drepression is
not confined to young freshmen,
however, nor is it necessarily re
lated to difficulties associated
with study.
The student may be in the grad
uate school, already past the first
flush of youth, and perhaps a lit
tle triste or- weary from the
steady grind and worried by con
stant competition with a most
gifted, accomplished, and brilliant
galaxy of colleagues.
At such times there may be a
kind of tacit rebellion, an intellec
tual sit-down strike, so to speak,
when the mind seems to refuse to
do more work.
Any one of many circumstances |
can bring this about—impending
orals, a thesis due or overdue, an
unhappy love relationship, or dis
quieting news from home. Even
conspicuous success can bring on
this reaction in some individuals.!
Of course, the common-sense at
titude would be to quit for a
while, to do something else, to
have some fun and then come
back with renewed vigor. But this
seldom occurs to them, partly be
cause they have already lost some !
resilience and resourcefulness.
Work Until 111
The thought of absenting them
selves from work is far- too peril-1
ous. Instead, these students pre
fer to whip the tired horse. They
stay up later and get up earlier,
and they worry about all the
ground they still have to cover.
Sometimes fate takes over.They
come down with the flu or "a;
virus," or' they develop infectious i
mononucleosis. This seems a wel
come and respectable respite, but
it usually leaves them more ex
hausted than the illness itself
could account for - , and still un
able to work.
Many other devices are automa-1
tieally resorted to as defensive
maneuvers against the underlying !
depression. Instead of doing extra
work, the student may stay in
bed in the mornings and sleep
until noon, thereby missing her :
lectures or even hour exams.
Her academic plight goes from
bad to worse, her depression and !
feelings of guilt increase, and her!
self-esteem continues to plummet.
She may adopt a kind of cynical.!
super-sophisticated, and super
cilious attitude toward the whole
academic community and cease to
be a functioning part of it.
Eat in Defense
These, together with the other
defenses I shall mention, are i
maladaptive, in the sense that
they are unrealistic and make'
matters worse rather than better.
Another common defense;
among young girls has to do with
their eating habits. They try to
allay their uneasiness and anxi
ety by eating too much.
Some of them will stuff them
selves with bread and butter at
mealtime; others will fill up on i
ice cream and candy between j
meals; still others become night;
feeders and ransack the kitchen I
when they should be asleep.
This extra feeding, which has
little to do with hunger, may be
episodic around examination time;
it may have become a kind of
chronic addiction.
Of course, it feeds as well the!
lowered self-esteem, puts an end
to dating, and becomes a new
source of discouragement. This
phenomenon is seen almost exclu
sively in girls, seldom in boys.
Sex Not Discussed
The relations between college
boys and girls are a tender sub
ject. seldom discussed between
the generations.
The contemporary sexual morals
of young people are so different
from those which goverened their
parents' or teachers' lives that a
common meeting ground between
them scarcely exists. (It is possi
ble that the parents have forgot
ten some of the details of their
own past experiences.)
Girls seldom, if ever, discuss
their sexual experiences with their j
parents, and when they do—un-|
less they are facing a crisis—one I
cannot escape the impression that j
the parent-child relationship is a
little unhealthy.
To be sure, girls often come to
college with standards handed to
them by their mothers and tacitly
upheld by their fathers. Letting a
boy kiss you good night, for ex
ample. is all right, but preferably
not on the first date.
Mere is where conflict often be
gins. If the gir l is standoffish and
stiff, the chances are she will not ,
see the boy again.
Boy Takes Over
But this is just what she wants
I to lores tall unless lie is a "jerk," '

and so, par tly to secure her aim
and partly because she is moved
and flattered she accepts his
kisses, and soon after she has not
already learned, she is taught to
"kiss back."
From this point on, the boy
takes over, unless he himself is
very timid. He tries to impose his
standards and rationalizations on
her.
He tries to convince her that it
is both more hottest and far
healthier to have intercourse than
to pet. He may be right.
In any case, he is usually as
idealistic as she is and not just
out for fun or experience, but he
is eager to prove himself.
Since, by this time, she has been
aroused -the more so because the
boy is usually serious—and is. as
the modern cliche has it, "emo
tionally involved," she may ac
cede to his wishes, often, to be
sure, with serious misgivings and
with a feeling of guilt. ("My
mother would die if she knew."
The chances are that her mother
wouldn't "die" at all; she might be
quite understanding. It is fathers
who need to be protected against
the facts of life.)
Intimacy Promoted
The present arrangement in co
educational or quais-coeducational
institutions facilitates these inti
macies. Boys and girls are pretty
constantly together in the class
room, in the library, at dances,
at parties, at rehearsals. They
drink Martinis and gin and tonics
together*. They light each other's
cigarettes.
And they study together, often
in the boy's room, and sometimes
they end up in bed. Roommates
are an inconvenience but seldom
a real hindrance. Much that is
unspoken is understood. The girl
and boy become each other's prop
erty. At a dance they dance to
gether' all evening. To pursue an
other boy's date is to commit the
unpardonable act of "bird-dog
ging." This is not acceptable be
havior 1 .
Girls, as well, impose their pro
prietary rights on their dates.
Promiscuity is not a manifesta
tion of sexual freedom, but rather
a symptom of a diseordered per -
sonality.
The foregoing description is of
one kind of behavior, but: of one
only. It is difficult to generalize
here, and not too satisfactory to
try to create stereotypes. None of
them is fixed or unvarying.
Boys Immature
Behavior changes in response to
outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.

In our culture, women still seem to regard
themselves as inferior. Perhaps it is a genuine
feeling of their own, or perhaps it is imposed
upon them by men. The new freedom has not
done away with it not the vote, nor trousers,
nor cigarettes, nor even standards of sexual be
havior thut are somewhat similar to men's
standards.
Indeed, all of these indexes of equality with
men appear often as an uncertain effort to deny
the confusion of roles in which modern society
has placed women.
Although the formal college curriculum does
not recognize a difference between male and
female students, this does not mean that their
needs are identical far from it.
1 know t hat to generalize here is risky busi
ness and that what I shall say may be only par

tially true. But it seems obvious enough that
as a boy approaches graduation he will have
his eye out for a job or a career, and a girl will
have hers on marriage.
Working Wives
This does not mean that college boys are in
different to finding a wife or that gills are un
concerned about earning money soon after
graduation. The many early collegiate mar
riages in which young wives today contribute
to the family income—if, indeed, they do not
pay for most of their husbands' graduate tuition
—would belie any such not ion.
Whether they are gainfully employed or not,
however, or whether or not they have decided to
go to graduate school and perhaps prepare
themselves for one of the professions architec
ture, business, city planning, engineering, medi
cine, the ministry, law, scientific research, social
work, teaching, or others (all are now open to
women) they usually are interested, first and

foremost, in finding a mate.
They do not shout this from the housetops.
They often spend a good deal of their time and
energy in trying to conceal it from themselves
and from others.
There are exceptions, of course, among them
some few dedicated female scholars who put
their work ahead of everything else—often, to
be sure, at great cost.
But this is not true of the run of the mill.
Mostly Marriage
For them, marriage is the paramount goal
and the presiding wish. Sometimes they are
willing to postpone it until they have achieved
more proximal goals—this degree or that job,
for example—but it is pretty constantly in the
back of their minds.
In some women's colleges as many as 50 per
cent of the senior class continue their formal
education in graduate school.
Many of these young women prepare them

selves for the professions or continue their stu
dies for various motives other than a clear in
terest in scholarship: to postpone the evil day
of going out into the world; to raise their mar
ket value in getting jobs; to remain in the
relatively protected environment of an institu
tion of learning; to continue to meet interesting
people.
"People," it should be said, is the current
euphemism for men. (One must not call the
devil by his name.) We know that the motive
behind study may have a determining influence
both on the quality of the work and on the
enthusiasm with which it is undertaken.
When motives are too mixed they may result
in confusion, conflict, and dissatisfaction.
Husbands and Classes, Too
Graduate work in itself, however, need no
longer be a deterrent to marriage. Many young
women combine the two ventures with surpris
ing skill and apparent equanimity.

The median age of girls when they marry is
now about twenty, and the preoccupation with
marriage becomes fairly persistent when this
age is past.
One can observe this frequently among grad
uate students.
Today a young lady ol twenty-one who is still
single is apt to think of herself as an old maid.
She prefers, however, to see herself as well set
tled with the man of her choice, or of her
dreams, who loves and cherishes her and by
whom she will eventually have about four
children.
Once she has met him, she often appears to
care little about how much money they will
have, what side of the tracks he was born on,
his social or ethnic background, or his religion.
Love is what counts, or at least what seems to
be love. And she thinks she wants a man whom
she can look up to, who has been exposed to
at least an equivalent formal education and is
perhaps a little better in his stu
dies than she is.
This makes her feel more se
cure.
How Security?
One hears a great deal about
security. It has become the golden
calf of today. When one stops to
analyze what is meant by it, one
soon learns that it has little to do
with jobs, with income, or with
social status, but is a subjective
feeling derived usually from a
certain sense of approbation and
depending more on self-approba
tion than on anything else.
This is the rock on which many
young college women founder. To
have the affection and esteem of a
young man whom they admire
seems to many the safest bul
wark against their self-doubt and
their feelings of insufficiency.
But the young man is often
very young, far Jess ready for a
real, rewarding, and growing rela
tionship than is the girl. And so
the bulwark often turns out to be
but a slender reed, at least from
the point of view of her needs.
Naturally enough, this may
lead to trouble. The single most
frequently encountered emotional
disturbance among these young
women is depression. Sometimes
it is so sweeping that little seems
left of the normally functioning
personality, and there may then
be a real risk of suicide.
Depressed College Girls
Fortunately, this is relatively
rare. What is common, however,
in the college girl is a loss of zest,
a feeling of apathy or fatigue,
and an apparent need for extra
hours of sleep, a very much low
ered self-esteem, with sensitivity
to other people's opinions and re
actions, and, above all. an inabil
ity to get work done.
To hand in written material on
lime means somehow to commit
oneself, to expose oneself to com
ment and criticism before which
failing spirits falter. Often the
printed page seems to lack mean
ing; attention, concentration, and
comprehension are at a low level.
Instead, there is brooding, day
dreaming. mounting dissatisfac
tion with self, and a feeling of
guilt because of time and oppor
tunities wasted — guilt tinctured
with anxiety: "What will happen
to me?" "Will my scholarship be
renewed?" "1 mustn't let my par
ents down; sending me to college
has been a great sacrifice for
them."
Identity Crisis-Normal
This phenomenon, in greater or
lesser degree, is sufficiently com
mon to be called "normal." I have
called it a depression; I do not in
sist on this as a clinical diagnosis.
It has been described by some as
an identity crisis, by others as
adolescent turmoil.
Behind it there are, of course,
feelings of inadequacy, self-ab
sorption, worry, and accompany
ing anxiety. The significant facts
are the lowered self-esteem and
the diminution in zest, energy,
and capacity to function in a cre
ative way.
The depression seems to bo a
kind of declaration of dependence,
of helplessness, and a muted cry
for help as well.
And it occurs at some time and
in varying intensity in practically
every girl during her career at
college.
Now, the student who experi
ences this need not be severely
neurotic, nor are these manifesta
tions necessarily evidence of any
profound or abnormal emotional
disturbance.
Frosh Adjustment
They may simply represent—in
a freshman, for example — the
first response of a sensitive, naive
adolescent to a new, frighteningly
complicated, and sophisticated en
vironment.
After all. some of these girls
are only sixteen or barely seven
teen. They may have come from
small towns, and they may be the
first ones from their high schools
to be accepted in one of the major
women's colleges. All eyes arc on
them, and their parents are inor
dinately proud. The girls feel that
they are in heaven at last.
But they soon find the atmos
phere rarefied and the air heady.
They may never before have had
to work hard, even in order to
lead their classes. They are asked
to write a paper not on the char
acter of Silas Marner or on the
most interesting experience they
had during their summer vaca
tions (in many high schools they
are not given any written assign
ments), but, for example, on "The
Relation of Leonardo's Writing to
His Painting and to Fifteenth-cen
tury Ait. in General."
Themes-Impossible
After chewing their pencils for
a while and twirling a lock of hair,
they finally brazen it out and go
to the library. Even after they
have mastered the indexing sys
tem. they are appalled by the
number of cards under the head
ing "Leonardo," and they find
nothing whatever orr the assigned
topic.
Perhaps for the first time in
their lives they are forced to read
actively instead of passively and
to do some quiet, hard thinking.
This is not only a strange experi
ence but almost akin to physical
pain.
And so there is a flight into so

lace: a little chat with the girl in
the next room, who may have
been to one of those progressive
schools where this kind of assign
ment was familial- enough; or per
haps their neighbor attended a
high-powered, exclusive board
ing school and has gained so
much poise and self-assurance
that nothing appears to daunt her.
Or - maybe our young freshman
is the daughter of a trustee and
her mother was the college hero
ine of her day—not only Phi Beta
Kappa, but the belle of the ball as
well. This puts additional pressure
on the student, who develops an
egregious need to make good in
spite of the awareness of her own
ineptitude.

outer impacts and inner needs and
to those morals and conventions
which the girl brings with her
from school.
There are, of course, "popular"
girls who have a different date
every night and like to keep lots
of boys on the string; idealistic,
old-fashioned girls, perhaps with
a religious upbringing, who want
to keep themselves pure for the
great love to come; shy, imma
ture girls who do not date; and
girls who manage to make them
selves so unattractive by over
eating or by their slovenly dress
that they are seldom approached
by boys.
The boys themselves are often
strikingly immature, adolescent,
and dependent, and get much com
fort and support from the steady
affection of motherly young
women.
Self-esteem Loss
One gets the impression that
the relationship between the sexes
is still in an experimental phase,
that it is motivated partly by
idealism, partly by a spirit of re
bellion against parents or others
in authority, partly by the desire
of young people to find out about
themselves, partly by loneliness,
partly by a kind of new conven
tionality and a wish not to miss
anything, but above all, for the
girls, by the feeling of approba
tion which the steady attention of
one boy gives them.
When he does not call up for
two days, the girl's world begins
to totter.
The demands are often unequal
and at variance. By the time the
girl has said "yes" to herself arrd
has stilled her doubts and her
feeling of guilt, the boy may be
on the way out of the relationship.
This leads to quarreling and a
loss of dignity and self-esteem in
the girl. She may feel bereft, or
"all empty inside." When she is
then asked to do a paper on "lam
bulos' Sun-state and Its Relation
to the Pergamene Revolt under
Aristonicos in 133 8.C.," she may
well be dismayed as she stares,
with a blank mind, at a blarrk
piece of paper.
Work Affected
It seems to me that educators
have at least the responsibility of
looking facts in the face. If they
relax parietal rules sufficiently to
permit girls to go to boy's rooms
and remain there until late, their
they should realize what the con
sequences are likely to be.
They should realize, too, that
these pressures on gir ls, even the
most resilient and well balanced
of them, will at times interfere
with their work.
It is all very well to say that
this is part of life and that they
must learn to take things in their
stride. We seem to forget that
life is fuller and moves faster for
them than it did for us at their
age. They have more "experi
ences" in a week than most of us
had in a year.

Mistakes Costly
Dean Briggs of Harvard used
to say that college is a place to
make mistakes, but mistakes to
day are far costlier than they
once were.
The price of academic failure,
or even mediocre performance,
may be great. It means that fur
ther graduate study is probably
barred or that good jobs are not
easily come by.
The price of mistakes in rela
tions with the opposite sex can be
high indeed, sometimes nearly
ruinous.
Young girls, one must remem
ber, are vulnerable, sensitive,
idealistic, often introspective and
emotional, inclined to think ill of
themselves and to compare them
selves, to their own disadvantage,
wilh men, whose good opinion
means so much to them.
Concern for Chaos
We should recognize them for
what they are, as wonderful
young women in their own right,
and build up this positive picture.
I have been greatly impressed
with their candor and frankness,
with their willingness to avow
their feelings and to cut through
much conventional cant and none
sense.
Many of them have a gift for
understanding themselves and
others and a need to talk out some
of their perplexities and to find
some ethical and aesthetic pattern
for their lives.
They are distressed by the
formless chaos that surrounds
them and sometimes recognize
this for what it is, as evil. They
know intuitively that the unex
amined life is not worth living.
They are, of course, concerned
with themselves and revel in
their won freedom, but they are
willing to prepare Ihemselves
emotionally, at least, for the
eventual task of child rearing,
which they appear to do with so
much competence and even joy.
A college which disregards their
essential nature is doing only part
of its job.
Need to Talk
If it wants girls to get the best
out of their courses of instruc
tions. then provision must be
made for some easement and for
some time for discussion with in
telligent and reasonably mature
adults who are not too quick to
give advice but are willing to
listen.
I recall a young girl saying to
me once that she could do her
work all right, but it didn't leave
her time to grow up.
Young people need time for this
and time to talk and to give ex

pression to some of their perplex
ities. I realize that we have not
found the ideal way to success in
this enterprise, that each college
will have to follow the plan that
fits its own tradition.
Everyone concerned with young
people must l)e concerned with
this aspect of their development.
If not, what passes for education
ma> be only a kind of "intellec
tual conditioning," without depth
of meaning, or hope for the fu
ture.
Encourage Sense of Identity
I have no wish to end this arti
cle on a negative note, nor to
leave the reader with the impres
sion that nothing can be accomp
lished either by way of preventing
these emotional disturbances in
young college women or of deal
ing with them once they have
arisen.
Exactly the reverse is true.
There is probably no segment of
the population which appears to
be more amenable to treatment
than just this group of intelligent,
sensitive, idealistic young women
with their futures before them.
We have no sure formula to
prevent the kind of depression 1
have described in this article.
We do not know how to instill j
humor where none exists. But we
can encourage self-acceptance and
a sense of identity; and. unless the
student has been too much dam
aged in childhood by a lack of
trust, we can provide an atmos
phere, even a rigorously competi- j
tive one, in which courage does |
not too quickly flag.
Inspiration Vital
There is much to be said for j
confrontation with more mature;
persons, not only in the faculty
but in the student body, too,!
where the inclusion of some older
men and women, who are com
pleting unfinished college work,
can add to the meaningfulness of
study.
And the choice of new members

of a faculty should be made with
an eye to their concern for stu
dents as well as for their crea
tive scholarship. When the two
are combined, the stage is well
set. There is a salutary effect also
in good talk, not only of the bull
session kind, but talk with sophis
ticated, critical persons who are
concerned with the human situa
tion.
Out of this can come compelling
and charismatic ideas, which may
last a lifetime.
Nothing we can do for this gen
eration or the next can be more
important, than to help these
young women toward a clearer
image of themselves. This will
give them the self-esteem they
need and the vigor to lead satisfy
ing and creative lives.
