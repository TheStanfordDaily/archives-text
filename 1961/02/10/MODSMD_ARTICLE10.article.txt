# JFK Urges Medical Plan Under Social Security
## Aid Would Cover 14.2 Million, Provide for Better Facilities 
### 
WASHINGTON (I Pi) President Kenneth asked a sharply
divided Gongress yesterday lo make good on his campaign pledge
to provide more than SL billion a year in medical aid U> ihe elderh
through the Social Security system.
I lie, pay-as-you-go health plan "is not a program of socialized

medicine," he told Congress in a
special message asking for en
actment of one of his pet projects.
Officials said it would cover
14.2 million persons past their
65th birthday a« of Jan. 1, 1963. It
would mean a $1.5 billion a year
increase in social security taxes
on workers and their employers.
IX ADDITION, Kennedy called
for a series of other measures de
signed to help reduce the rate of
infant mortality, protect children
as they grow up and give every
one more doctors and better hos
pitals.
He proposed federal scholar
ships to increase the supply of
doctors and dentists, and grants to
improve community nursing and
hospital services. He said there
should be aid to medical and
dental schools, and more medical
research.
But most controversial by far
was his proposal to use the exist
ing social security system to fi
nance medical care of the elderly.
It was headed for a major con
gressional battle.
HESOUGHT enactment of such
a program after winning the Dem
ocratic nomination last summer,
but lost out to the Eisenhower
backed plan under which the
states may join the federal gov
ernment in a program limited to
the needy elderly.
Even Democrats in Congress
who applauded Kennedy's request
predicted it faced rough going.
Sen. Quentin N. Burdick, D-N.D.,
a member of the public
committee, endorsed the program
but said he had no illusion it
would sail through.
