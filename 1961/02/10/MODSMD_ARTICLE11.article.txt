# New Congolese Gov't Replaces Military Rule
## 
### 
LEOPOLDVILLE, The Congo
HJPl—President Joseph Kasavu
bu yesterday named a pro-west
ern, pro-Belgium provisional gov
ernment to replace the Congo's
military regime and pledged a
fight 1o the death against foreign
intervention, including action by
the United Nations.
Maj. Gen. Joseph Mobutu, who
imprisoned ex - premier Patrice
Lumumba, remained in charge of
the Congolese army. He was re
ported moving up the Congo
River with troop reinforcements.
His forces were said to have cap
tured Soviet-built trucks for a
new invasion of Oriental Prov
ince, the pro-Lumumba strong
hold.
KASAVUBU named Joseph
Ileo, former senate president, as
premier of the provisional gov
ernment. He said Ileo wou 1 d
assume office immediately and
rule until the Congolese parlia
ment could be reconvened.
No date was set for the recall
of the parliament which was
"neutralized" along with all po
litical parties when Mobutu
seized power last fall at the
height of the Kasavubu-Lumumba
power struggle and set up his
college of commissioners.
Kasavubu did not name a min
ister for defense or a minister of
justice. The president obviously
is convinced that Mobutu, com
mander-in-chief of the army,
should remain in control of the
armed forces for the time being
to keep it strictly out of politics.
OBSERVERS said the justice
post probably will not be filled
until parliament is reconvened.
The minister selected probably
will be called on to draw up
charges against Lumumba and
other "traitors."
With the exception of Cyrille
Andoula, who broke with Lumum
ba because of his pro-Communist
policies, there are no former Lu
mumbists in the new government.
Kasavubu said he will nominate
a second vice premier and that
"this post is reserved from some
one from Katanga." It was specu
lated the post might go to Presi
dent Moise Tshombe of the break
away province in southeastern
Congo, also an ardent foe of
Lumumba.
Kasavubu formed the govern
ment by constitutional decree
the same power he employed to
oust Lumumba as premier and
later to install the Mobutu
selected commission.
THE PRESIDENT praised the
commission, many of whose
younger members interrupted
their studies to return and help
save the Congo when they were
needed, he said.
In making the move known in
a radio broadcast, Kasavubu said
the cabinet will be submitted for
approval to the political round
table conference meeting in Leo
poldville. He took the step, he
said, in compliance with the
wishes of the conference.
Kasavubu denounced support
ers of Lumumba who control Ori
ental and Kivu Provinces and the
north of Katanga.
And in an apparent warning to
the United Nations. Kasavubu
stressed the government "will
jealously safeguard the independ
ence and sovereignty of our young
republic."
IN AN OIIYIOUS reference to
United Nations Secretary-General
Dag Hammarskjold's suggestion
that rival forces be disarmed, Kas
avubu said:

LEOPOLDVILLE, The Congo
HJPl—President Joseph Kasavu
bu yesterday named a pro-west
ern, pro-Belgium provisional gov
ernment to replace the Congo's
military regime and pledged a
fight 1o the death against foreign
intervention, including action by
the United Nations.
Maj. Gen. Joseph Mobutu, who
imprisoned ex - premier Patrice
Lumumba, remained in charge of
the Congolese army. He was re
ported moving up the Congo
River with troop reinforcements.
His forces were said to have cap
tured Soviet-built trucks for a
new invasion of Oriental Prov
ince, the pro-Lumumba strong
hold.
KASAVUBU named Joseph
Ileo, former senate president, as
premier of the provisional gov
ernment. He said Ileo wou 1 d
assume office immediately and
rule until the Congolese parlia
ment could be reconvened.
No date was set for the recall
of the parliament which was
"neutralized" along with all po
litical parties when Mobutu
seized power last fall at the
height of the Kasavubu-Lumumba
power struggle and set up his
college of commissioners.
Kasavubu did not name a min
ister for defense or a minister of
justice. The president obviously
is convinced that Mobutu, com
mander-in-chief of the army,
should remain in control of the
armed forces for the time being
to keep it strictly out of politics.
OBSERVERS said the justice
post probably will not be filled
until parliament is reconvened.
The minister selected probably
will be called on to draw up
charges against Lumumba and
other "traitors."
With the exception of Cyrille
Andoula, who broke with Lumum
ba because of his pro-Communist
policies, there are no former Lu
mumbists in the new government.
Kasavubu said he will nominate
a second vice premier and that
"this post is reserved from some
one from Katanga." It was specu
lated the post might go to Presi
dent Moise Tshombe of the break
away province in southeastern
Congo, also an ardent foe of
Lumumba.
Kasavubu formed the govern
ment by constitutional decree
the same power he employed to
oust Lumumba as premier and
later to install the Mobutu
selected commission.
THE PRESIDENT praised the
commission, many of whose
younger members interrupted
their studies to return and help
save the Congo when they were
needed, he said.
In making the move known in
a radio broadcast, Kasavubu said
the cabinet will be submitted for
approval to the political round
table conference meeting in Leo
poldville. He took the step, he
said, in compliance with the
wishes of the conference.
Kasavubu denounced support
ers of Lumumba who control Ori
ental and Kivu Provinces and the
north of Katanga.
And in an apparent warning to
the United Nations. Kasavubu
stressed the government "will
jealously safeguard the independ
ence and sovereignty of our young
republic."
