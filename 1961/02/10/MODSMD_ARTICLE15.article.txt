## Administration Taking Wide-ranging Measures to Check Outflow of Gold 
### 
While the gold speculators have
for the time being been dis
couraged by the firm pledges and
declarations to defend the dollar,
it is evident from the President's
message that all this is on the
surface and not in the substance
of the problem.
The problem has been posed for
11 years, since 1950, and it will
take some years to solve it. Since
1950 we have run an average net

deficit in our in
national trans
actions of nearly
two bi 11 ion s a
year. Over the
whole period this
I has amounted to
'a deficit of 21 bil
lions. In foreign
[capital invest
iment, in mili
f tary expendi
tures abroad, and

in foreign economic aid, we have
paid out about 21 billion more
than we earned in the world. By
doing this we provided the re
serves on which the post-war
monetary system of the free econ
omies rests.
DURING most of these years,
for all practical purposes in all
of them until 1958, the foreigners
who held the dollars were satis
fied to hold most of them, and
not to cash them into gold, as they
had every right to do. But in the
past three years not only have
our deficits sharply increased, but
our creditors have been demand
ing gold.
The demand for gold signified
that foreign bankers, corpora
tions, and private investors had
come to think that it was more
profitable to move their funds
out of the United States and that
it might be safer. In effect they
were saying that the United
States could not go on forever,
or much longer, running a balance
of payments deficit of three to
four billion dollars a year.
Nor can it. And that is why the
Administration is now attacking
the problem of the deficit by a
wide array of measures. The Pies
ident's message contain proposals
to provide attractive short term
interest rates for foreigners while
avoiding a rise in long term in
terest rates for American public
and private investment. The range

of these measures extends to far
reaching plans, which will take
time to realize, to improve the
competitive position of American
industry.
THE BASIC premise of the Ad
ministration policy is that under
lying the speculative movements
away from, and for the moment
back to, the dollar, there is a
basic deficit which without effec
tive measures to reduce it, will
average around two billions or
more a year. This basic deficit
cannot be dealt with, as can the
specula! iv e, by psychological
means, by pledges, warnings, and
the like, or even by adjusting in
terest rates.
The basic deficit arises out of
our over-all foreign policy—out
of our military
aborad, out of our desire to en
courage American foreign invest
ment, out of economic aid to for
eign countries.
Some may think that the basic
deficit could be overcome by stop
ping all foreign military and eco
nomic aid, or by instituting ex
change controls. But such a revo
lutionary policy would be impos
sible in the world as it is today.
The Administration has taken a
firm decision that it will defend
the convertibility of the dollar at
$35 an ounce for gold, that it will
maintain, and probably even en
large, our foreign economic aid,
and that it will not resort to the
restrictionist measures which
weaker countries without our
banking responsibilities use when
they have an international deficit.
THIS DECISION to stand upon
an expansionist or liberal foreign
policy has with it a corollary—
which is indicated but not spelled
out in the President's message -
that the liberal policy requires in
ternational cooperation among
the advanced industrial countries.
Alone and by ourselves we can
not maintain a liberal economic
foreign policy if Ihe countries
which are now running a surplus
in their balance of payments as
against our' deficit, do not co
operate. The surplus countries
are Japan, Italy, the Netherlands,
and above all West Germany.
There is no question of our ask
ing them to help us. The very sug
gestion is odious in view of the
fact that, the United States is in-

comparably the richest country in
the world. The American case is
simply Ihis. Beginning with the
Marshall Plan, this country, which
then had an enormous surplus,
has deliberately and as a matter
of national and international pol
icy run a deficit in order to over
come the dollar shortage abroad.
This policy made possible the re
covery of Japan and Western
Europe.
Now the time has come when
continuing American deficits are
not only not needed but a posi
tive danger to the stability of the
international monetary system.
What is needed now is that the
surplus countries, 112 orem os t
among them West Germany, take
measures of their own to bring
the international balance of pay
ments into equilibrium. Once the
Senate has approved Unit ed
States membership in the Organi
zation for Economic Cooperation
and Development, we should, as
the President indicates in his mes
sage, argue for a new principle. It
is that the surplus countries,
principally West Germany, should
not accumulate reserves out of the
deficits run by countries like the
United States, which spend so
much abroad for the common de
fense and for the less developed
countries.
IN THK OECD, and privately,
we shall be persuading the West
Germans that, having acquired a
very large surplus, they have an
international duty to behave like
a responsible creditor country.
Little of their surplus is now
used for foreign aid or investment
abroad. The West German inter
est rates, which attract the gold,
are among the highest in Western
Europe. The West German wage
rates, in relation to their produc
tivity, make them over-competi
tive in the international export
markets. Furthermore, their for
eign assistance is being given
largely in the form of very liberal
export credits. The President
made no mention of the German
problem in his message. But the
German problem is very much in
the minds of all serious students
of the problem of international
payments.
Presumably, if not immediately
then after the coming German
election, the Germans will move
into line and play according to the
rules of the game in the world of
free economy. Those rules imply
a special obligation on surplus
countries. For not to observe
these rules woi. Id precipitate
eventually a serious international
monetary crisis.

While the gold speculators have
for the time being been dis
couraged by the firm pledges and
declarations to defend the dollar,
it is evident from the President's
message that all this is on the
surface and not in the substance
of the problem.
The problem has been posed for
11 years, since 1950, and it will
take some years to solve it. Since
1950 we have run an average net

deficit in our in
national trans
actions of nearly
two bi 11 ion s a
year. Over the
whole period this
I has amounted to
'a deficit of 21 bil
lions. In foreign
[capital invest
iment, in mili
f tary expendi
tures abroad, and

in foreign economic aid, we have
paid out about 21 billion more
than we earned in the world. By
doing this we provided the re
serves on which the post-war
monetary system of the free econ
omies rests.
DURING most of these years,
for all practical purposes in all
of them until 1958, the foreigners
who held the dollars were satis
fied to hold most of them, and
not to cash them into gold, as they
had every right to do. But in the
past three years not only have
our deficits sharply increased, but
our creditors have been demand
ing gold.
The demand for gold signified
that foreign bankers, corpora
tions, and private investors had
come to think that it was more
profitable to move their funds
out of the United States and that
it might be safer. In effect they
were saying that the United
States could not go on forever,
or much longer, running a balance
of payments deficit of three to
four billion dollars a year.
Nor can it. And that is why the
Administration is now attacking
the problem of the deficit by a
wide array of measures. The Pies
ident's message contain proposals
to provide attractive short term
interest rates for foreigners while
avoiding a rise in long term in
terest rates for American public
and private investment. The range

of these measures extends to far
reaching plans, which will take
time to realize, to improve the
competitive position of American
industry.
THE BASIC premise of the Ad
ministration policy is that under
lying the speculative movements
away from, and for the moment
back to, the dollar, there is a
basic deficit which without effec
tive measures to reduce it, will
average around two billions or
more a year. This basic deficit
cannot be dealt with, as can the
specula! iv e, by psychological
means, by pledges, warnings, and
the like, or even by adjusting in
terest rates.
The basic deficit arises out of
our over-all foreign policy—out
of our military
aborad, out of our desire to en
courage American foreign invest
ment, out of economic aid to for
eign countries.
Some may think that the basic
deficit could be overcome by stop
ping all foreign military and eco
nomic aid, or by instituting ex
change controls. But such a revo
lutionary policy would be impos
sible in the world as it is today.
The Administration has taken a
firm decision that it will defend
the convertibility of the dollar at
$35 an ounce for gold, that it will
maintain, and probably even en
large, our foreign economic aid,
and that it will not resort to the
restrictionist measures which
weaker countries without our
banking responsibilities use when
they have an international deficit.
THIS DECISION to stand upon
an expansionist or liberal foreign
policy has with it a corollary—
which is indicated but not spelled
out in the President's message -
that the liberal policy requires in
ternational cooperation among
the advanced industrial countries.
Alone and by ourselves we can
not maintain a liberal economic
foreign policy if Ihe countries
which are now running a surplus
in their balance of payments as
against our' deficit, do not co
operate. The surplus countries
are Japan, Italy, the Netherlands,
and above all West Germany.
There is no question of our ask
ing them to help us. The very sug
gestion is odious in view of the
fact that, the United States is in-

comparably the richest country in
the world. The American case is
simply Ihis. Beginning with the
Marshall Plan, this country, which
then had an enormous surplus,
has deliberately and as a matter
of national and international pol
icy run a deficit in order to over
come the dollar shortage abroad.
This policy made possible the re
covery of Japan and Western
Europe.
Now the time has come when
continuing American deficits are
not only not needed but a posi
tive danger to the stability of the
international monetary system.
What is needed now is that the
surplus countries, 112 orem os t
among them West Germany, take
measures of their own to bring
the international balance of pay
ments into equilibrium. Once the
Senate has approved Unit ed
States membership in the Organi
zation for Economic Cooperation
and Development, we should, as
the President indicates in his mes
sage, argue for a new principle. It
is that the surplus countries,
principally West Germany, should
not accumulate reserves out of the
deficits run by countries like the
United States, which spend so
much abroad for the common de
fense and for the less developed
countries.
IN THK OECD, and privately,
we shall be persuading the West
Germans that, having acquired a
very large surplus, they have an
international duty to behave like
a responsible creditor country.
Little of their surplus is now
used for foreign aid or investment
abroad. The West German inter

are among the highest in Western

not only not needed but a posi
tive danger to the stability of the
international monetary system.
What is needed now is that the
surplus countries, 112 orem os t
among them West Germany, take
measures of their own to bring
the international balance of pay
ments into equilibrium. Once the
Senate has approved Unit ed
States membership in the Organi
zation for Economic Cooperation
and Development, we should, as
the President indicates in his mes
sage, argue for a new principle. It
is that the surplus countries,
principally West Germany, should
not accumulate reserves out of the
deficits run by countries like the
United States, which spend so
much abroad for the common de
fense and for the less developed
countries.
IN THK OECD, and privately,
we shall be persuading the West
Germans that, having acquired a
very large surplus, they have an
international duty to behave like
a responsible creditor country.
Little of their surplus is now
used for foreign aid or investment
abroad. The West German inter
est rates, which attract the gold,
are among the highest in Western
Europe. The West German wage
rates, in relation to their produc
tivity, make them over-competi
tive in the international export
markets. Furthermore, their for
eign assistance is being given
largely in the form of very liberal
export credits. The President
made no mention of the German
problem in his message. But the
German problem is very much in
the minds of all serious students
of the problem of international
payments.
Presumably, if not immediately
then after the coming German
election, the Germans will move
into line and play according to the
rules of the game in the world of
free economy. Those rules imply
a special obligation on surplus
countries. For not to observe
these rules woi. Id precipitate
eventually a serious international
monetary crisis.

While the gold speculators have
for the time being been dis
couraged by the firm pledges and
declarations to defend the dollar,
it is evident from the President's
message that all this is on the
surface and not in the substance
of the problem.
The problem has been posed for
11 years, since 1950, and it will
take some years to solve it. Since
1950 we have run an average net

deficit in our in
national trans
actions of nearly
two bi 11 ion s a
year. Over the
whole period this
I has amounted to
'a deficit of 21 bil
lions. In foreign
[capital invest
iment, in mili
f tary expendi
tures abroad, and

in foreign economic aid, we have
paid out about 21 billion more
than we earned in the world. By
doing this we provided the re
serves on which the post-war
monetary system of the free econ
omies rests.
DURING most of these years,
for all practical purposes in all
of them until 1958, the foreigners
who held the dollars were satis
fied to hold most of them, and
not to cash them into gold, as they
had every right to do. But in the
past three years not only have
our deficits sharply increased, but
our creditors have been demand
ing gold.
The demand for gold signified
that foreign bankers, corpora
tions, and private investors had
come to think that it was more
profitable to move their funds
out of the United States and that
it might be safer. In effect they
were saying that the United
States could not go on forever,
or much longer, running a balance
of payments deficit of three to
four billion dollars a year.
Nor can it. And that is why the
Administration is now attacking
the problem of the deficit by a
wide array of measures. The Pies
ident's message contain proposals
to provide attractive short term
interest rates for foreigners while
avoiding a rise in long term in
terest rates for American public
and private investment. The range

of these measures extends to far
reaching plans, which will take
time to realize, to improve the
competitive position of American
industry.
THE BASIC premise of the Ad
ministration policy is that under
lying the speculative movements
away from, and for the moment
back to, the dollar, there is a
basic deficit which without effec
tive measures to reduce it, will
average around two billions or
more a year. This basic deficit
cannot be dealt with, as can the
specula! iv e, by psychological
means, by pledges, warnings, and
the like, or even by adjusting in
terest rates.
The basic deficit arises out of
our over-all foreign policy—out
of our military
aborad, out of our desire to en
courage American foreign invest
ment, out of economic aid to for
eign countries.
Some may think that the basic
deficit could be overcome by stop
ping all foreign military and eco
nomic aid, or by instituting ex
change controls. But such a revo
lutionary policy would be impos
sible in the world as it is today.
The Administration has taken a
firm decision that it will defend
the convertibility of the dollar at
$35 an ounce for gold, that it will
maintain, and probably even en
large, our foreign economic aid,
and that it will not resort to the
restrictionist measures which
weaker countries without our
banking responsibilities use when
they have an international deficit.
THIS DECISION to stand upon
an expansionist or liberal foreign
policy has with it a corollary—
which is indicated but not spelled
out in the President's message -
that the liberal policy requires in
ternational cooperation among
the advanced industrial countries.
Alone and by ourselves we can
not maintain a liberal economic
foreign policy if Ihe countries
which are now running a surplus
in their balance of payments as
against our' deficit, do not co
operate. The surplus countries
are Japan, Italy, the Netherlands,
and above all West Germany.
There is no question of our ask
ing them to help us. The very sug
gestion is odious in view of the
fact that, the United States is in-

comparably the richest country in
the world. The American case is
simply Ihis. Beginning with the
Marshall Plan, this country, which
then had an enormous surplus,
has deliberately and as a matter
of national and international pol
icy run a deficit in order to over
come the dollar shortage abroad.
This policy made possible the re
covery of Japan and Western
Europe.
Now the time has come when
continuing American deficits are
not only not needed but a posi
tive danger to the stability of the
international monetary system.
What is needed now is that the

that the liberal policy requires in
ternational cooperation among
the advanced industrial countries.
Alone and by ourselves we can
not maintain a liberal economic
foreign policy if Ihe countries
which are now running a surplus
in their balance of payments as
against our' deficit, do not co
operate. The surplus countries
are Japan, Italy, the Netherlands,
and above all West Germany.
There is no question of our ask
ing them to help us. The very sug
gestion is odious in view of the
fact that, the United States is in-

comparably the richest country in
the world. The American case is
simply Ihis. Beginning with the
Marshall Plan, this country, which
then had an enormous surplus,
has deliberately and as a matter
of national and international pol
icy run a deficit in order to over
come the dollar shortage abroad.
This policy made possible the re
covery of Japan and Western
Europe.
Now the time has come when
continuing American deficits are
not only not needed but a posi
tive danger to the stability of the
international monetary system.
What is needed now is that the
surplus countries, 112 orem os t
among them West Germany, take
measures of their own to bring
the international balance of pay
ments into equilibrium. Once the
Senate has approved Unit ed
States membership in the Organi
zation for Economic Cooperation
and Development, we should, as
the President indicates in his mes
sage, argue for a new principle. It
is that the surplus countries,
principally West Germany, should
not accumulate reserves out of the
deficits run by countries like the
United States, which spend so
much abroad for the common de
fense and for the less developed
countries.
IN THK OECD, and privately,
we shall be persuading the West
Germans that, having acquired a
very large surplus, they have an
international duty to behave like
a responsible creditor country.
Little of their surplus is now
used for foreign aid or investment
abroad. The West German inter
est rates, which attract the gold,
are among the highest in Western
Europe. The West German wage
rates, in relation to their produc
tivity, make them over-competi
tive in the international export
markets. Furthermore, their for
eign assistance is being given
largely in the form of very liberal
export credits. The President
made no mention of the German
problem in his message. But the
German problem is very much in
the minds of all serious students
of the problem of international
payments.
Presumably, if not immediately
then after the coming German
election, the Germans will move
into line and play according to the
rules of the game in the world of
free economy. Those rules imply
a special obligation on surplus
countries. For not to observe
these rules woi. Id precipitate
eventually a serious international
monetary crisis.

While the gold speculators have
for the time being been dis
couraged by the firm pledges and
declarations to defend the dollar,
it is evident from the President's
message that all this is on the
surface and not in the substance
of the problem.
The problem has been posed for
11 years, since 1950, and it will
take some years to solve it. Since
1950 we have run an average net

deficit in our in
national trans
actions of nearly
two bi 11 ion s a
year. Over the
whole period this
I has amounted to
'a deficit of 21 bil
lions. In foreign
[capital invest
iment, in mili
f tary expendi
tures abroad, and

in foreign economic aid, we have
paid out about 21 billion more
than we earned in the world. By
doing this we provided the re
serves on which the post-war
monetary system of the free econ
omies rests.
DURING most of these years,
for all practical purposes in all
of them until 1958, the foreigners
who held the dollars were satis
fied to hold most of them, and
not to cash them into gold, as they
had every right to do. But in the
past three years not only have
our deficits sharply increased, but
our creditors have been demand
ing gold.
The demand for gold signified
that foreign bankers, corpora
tions, and private investors had
come to think that it was more
profitable to move their funds
out of the United States and that
it might be safer. In effect they
were saying that the United
States could not go on forever,
or much longer, running a balance
of payments deficit of three to
four billion dollars a year.
Nor can it. And that is why the
Administration is now attacking
the problem of the deficit by a
wide array of measures. The Pies
ident's message contain proposals
to provide attractive short term
interest rates for foreigners while
avoiding a rise in long term in
terest rates for American public
and private investment. The range

of these measures extends to far
reaching plans, which will take
time to realize, to improve the
competitive position of American
industry.
THE BASIC premise of the Ad
ministration policy is that under
lying the speculative movements
away from, and for the moment
back to, the dollar, there is a
basic deficit which without effec
tive measures to reduce it, will
average around two billions or
more a year. This basic deficit
cannot be dealt with, as can the
specula! iv e, by psychological
means, by pledges, warnings, and
the like, or even by adjusting in
terest rates.
The basic deficit arises out of
our over-all foreign policy—out
of our military
aborad, out of our desire to en
courage American foreign invest
ment, out of economic aid to for
eign countries.
Some may think that the basic
deficit could be overcome by stop
ping all foreign military and eco
nomic aid, or by instituting ex
change controls. But such a revo
lutionary policy would be impos
sible in the world as it is today.
The Administration has taken a
firm decision that it will defend
the convertibility of the dollar at
$35 an ounce for gold, that it will
maintain, and probably even en
large, our foreign economic aid,
and that it will not resort to the
restrictionist measures which
weaker countries without our
banking responsibilities use when
they have an international deficit.
THIS DECISION to stand upon
an expansionist or liberal foreign
policy has with it a corollary—
which is indicated but not spelled
out in the President's message -
that the liberal policy requires in
ternational cooperation among
the advanced industrial countries.
Alone and by ourselves we can
not maintain a liberal economic
foreign policy if Ihe countries
which are now running a surplus
in their balance of payments as
against our' deficit, do not co
operate. The surplus countries
are Japan, Italy, the Netherlands,
and above all West Germany.
