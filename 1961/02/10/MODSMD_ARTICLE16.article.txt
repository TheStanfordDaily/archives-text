## S.F.'s Mayor Christopher And City Hall Riots 
### 
San Francisco Mayor George i
Christopher, perhaps feeling that, i
after all, it's his city and he has
an opinion, too, has jumped feet j
first into the controversy about j
the House Un-American Activities
Committee's film on last May's
City Hall riots.
Earlier this week on Fulton'
Lewis Jr.'s radio program Chris
topher said, "They (the films) are
true. They are authentic. They
tell the truth."
THE MAYOR'S statement goes I
| on in this vein and bears a strik-;
1 ing resemblance to many of the:
; things said in the film, most of
! which are untrue. If one wished
; to be so bold, he could even sug- 1
| gest that Christopher is a "dupe"
of the committee and Fulton
1 Lewis Jr. (who's son is an inves
tigator for the Committee and
j the narrator of the films).
Among other things, the mayor J
1 is quoted as saying that the stu
dents were led by Communists I
and that the Communists used
/every tactic to incite the riot.
"Agitators" and "Communists"
i prompted the students who were
ordered to move o u t si d e, the j
mayor said. "S t u d en t s were
warned many times."
FINALLY, the mayor seems to !
have swallowed whole Ihe Com
mittee's line that a warning was i
given before the firehoses were j
turned on and that the students J
were dupes. Seemingly the fact j
that not a soul has been found!
who can recall any such warning
and that none of the students ar
rested at the hearings have ex

i pressed a feeling that they were
! duped or were even in the wrong,
impresses the mayor.
It is almost inconceivable that
, he honestly believes the things
that he was quoted as saying for
the benefit of Lewis' audience.
Another interesting facet of
' the mayor's statements lies in
the treatment of them in the San
; Francisco Chronicle. "The facts
have a way of get ling even,"
| Herb Caen said recently and Mel
! Wax, in his job of reporting
I Christopher's statements, cer
! tainly let ihe facts gel even with
the mayor.
IN HE M E M B E H I N C, that
Christopher was not at City Hall
| or even in San Francisco at the
time of the riots, Wax gives the
lie to Christopher's statement
that he saw "most of the events
i described."
By pointing out that no charges
were brought against anyone for
trying to "remove a gun" from a
I police officer, as Christopher
charged and that the student
charged with beating an officer
over the head with a nightstick
| has pleaded innocent, Wax helps
j regain some of the badly-needed
I perspective that the mayor seems
i to have lost.
It is difficult to figure out just
: what the mayor's game is. Maybe
â–  he feels that keeping his name
' on the front page of his city's
newspapers by prohibiting minors
i from jazz clubs and by pretend
ing to be a friend of the HUAC
will get him elected governor of
the state. We doubt it.
