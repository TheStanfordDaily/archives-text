Chappie Errors
The laugh is on the "Chappie!"
That stalwart defender of a free
press and free enterprise was to
have carried an ad for us in its
current issue lampooning the mil
itary. The issue appeared but the
ad did not. Not having heard a
word from the editors or the ad
men of the "Old Boy," you can
imagine my surprise yesterday
when I looked through a copy
for the ad.
i Immediately T telephoned the
i "Chappie" office to find out what
; had gone wrong. The young man
; who answered my call gulped
I slightly when I asked if he knew
! about the missing item. He did.
| The editors, he explained, had
I overruled the advertising depart
â–  ment, and had decided that the
: ad should not appear. It was, ac
cording to my informant, too
rrvuch "on the editorial side." "Do
you mean," I asked, "that it was
too strong for them?" He as
sented.
He went on to explain limply
that the editors felt that since tlie
"Chappie" is a university-con
nected periodical, they had a re
sponsibility, etc. . . . "Did you
know," I rejoined, "that this same
|ad has appeared already in the
DAILY?" He gasped. "In fact," I
continued, "it has been in .the
j DAILY twice. Will you tell your
editors that they lack the courage
already shown by the 1 DAILY." He
thanked me for my call, and, I
| like to think, then dashed off to
I carrv the tidings to those mem

hers of the "uncommitted genera
tion," the Chappie editors.
Thorugh acts of self-censorship
now, (hey are preparing them
selves well for their organization
man jobs in the future.
One things disturbs mo. Since a
member of the "Chappie" staff
had come to me more than two
months ago to ask mo to run this
particular ad in this issue,
mightn't I have expected the fear
less editors to have had the cour
tesy to communicate with me be
fore publication of this issue,
rather than have me discover the
deletion after the event?
Ah well, in the future all of my
advertising will go to the "Daily."
