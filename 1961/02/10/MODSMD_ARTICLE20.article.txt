WASHINGTON (UPl)â€”Union
leader Walter P. Reuther chal
lenged the American Medical As
sociation lasl night to stop "fight
ing ideological windmills" and
join in working out a compro
mise medical care program for
the aged.
The United Auto Workers pres
ident advanced the proposal in
the face of a charge by AMA
spokesman Edward R. Annis, a
Miami, Fla., surgeon, that Presi
dent Kennedy's plan to link medi
cal care to Social Security would
impose an unfair burden on ordi
nary taxpayers.
ANNIS, chairman of the legis
lative committee of the Florida
State Medical Association, said
physicians were concerned over
the plight of Americans 65 and
over well before politicians real
ized that the elderly have 16 mil- j
lion votes.

Reuther, who said this country
will be judged "not by what we
have but what we do with what
we have," said the Social Security
approach was the best way for
workers to insure themselves
against the medical needs of old
age.
HE CHALLENGED the medi
cal association to join forces with
the AFL-CIO, of which he is a
vice president, and work out a
compromise plan which also
would cover the four million
aged that Annis said would be
excluded under the Kennedy pro
posal. He said their benefits could
be financed out of general tax
revenues.
