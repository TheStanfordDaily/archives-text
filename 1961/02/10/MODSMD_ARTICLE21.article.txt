The weekend delay afforded
more time for private consulta
tions between U.S. Ambassador
Adlai E. Stevenson and Soviet
Ambassador Valerian A. Zorin,
who was predicating possible
East-West cooperation on a com
plete restoration of leftist Pa
trice Lumumba.
MOISi; TKIIOMBE, leader of
secessionist Katanga Province,
served notice, in a lelter to Ham
marskjold released yesterday,
that he would not consent to the
disarming of forces loyal to him
and warned that it would be
"practically impossible" to dis
arm Lumumba's jungle fighters.
Thomas Kanxa, an envoy from
Lumumba who arrived last week
end, told newsmen the price of
any peace in the Congo was the
release of the leftist leader. Once
Lumumba is released, Kan/.a
said, his forces will lay down
arms if he tells them to do so.
But, Kan/.a predicted, pro-West
ern president Joseph Kasavubu
will be unable to obtain such co
operation from the major forces
under Congolese strongman Maj.
Gen. Joseph D. Mobutu.
Kanxa, radiating confidence,
announced plans to set up head
quarters in New York on a long
term lease, even though he is not
recognized by the United Nations
as a delegate.
THE SECURITY Council de
bated Hammarskjold's neutrali
zation plan last Tuesday and then
adjourned indefinitely, ail hough
Zorin wanted a meeting to be
held today.
British Ambassador Sir Pat
rick Dean, Council President for
February, set the meeting for 11

ticipating in the debate, giving
the crowded Council table—de
signed for the 11 regular mem
bers and not more than a half
dozen participating non-members
the appearance of a rump ses
sion of the General Assembly.
Senegal, the latest country to
request the right to speak, asked
Dean to have the Council defer
any decision on the Congo until
the adjourned session of the Gen
eral Assembly resumes on Mar. 7.
