VIENTIANE. Laos (UPI)
Royal Laotian government Troops
pushing toward the strategic
Plaines Dos Jarres are within two
miles of the Communist rebel
stronghold, the Ministry of Na
tional Defense announced yester
day.
Ministry official Maj. Ekarat
said government forces have re
captured the village of Latuang,
two miles from the Plaines Dps
Jarres.
lIK SAID another government
column under Colonel Sanani
kone. pushing from the recently
captured Sala Phou Khoun road
junction, was about to occupy
Phou Soung village, 10 miles from
the junelion and leading toward
Xieng Khouang, another rebel
base.
"We are moving slowly due to
numerous land mines planted by
retreating enemy forces," Ekarat
said.
MEANWHILE Laotian Infor
mation Minister Bouavan Nora
sing said 5,000 troops from Com
munist North Viet Nam and their
Russian advisers were waging a
"campaign of terror" against
rebellious villagers in the Xieng
Khouang area.
There was no way to confirm
the report. Earlier claims that
Vietminh battalions from North
Viet Nam had intervened in Laos
were admit led by the govern
ment to be fabrications to impress
upon the Laotian people that fact
they had friends abroad who
would come to their aid.
Bouavan said the 15 Vietminh
battalions had sol fire to entire
villages and destroyed homes and
buildings as revenge against Lao
tians who rose up against the
rebel invaders who now hold the
Plain of Jars.
THE CLAIMS were much the
same as accusations by the clan
destine Pat hot Lao Radio which
daily accused American soldiers
of burning Laotian villages.
Loyal guerrillas in Communist
held Sam Nona Province in the
north are harrassing the Red
forces across the border from
Dienbienphu.
IT WAS learned, meanwhile,
that United Nations Secretary-
Cieneral Dag Ilammarskjold pro
posed the formation of a coalition
government to end the civil war
in Laos. It presumably would in
clude Prince Souvannn Phoumn.
the Premier who fled to Cambodia
when right-wing forces ap
proached Vientiane last December.
