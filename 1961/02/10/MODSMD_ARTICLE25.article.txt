# Senators Comment on Missile Gap
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Sen.
Stuart Symington accused the
Eisenhower administration yes
terday of deliberately withholding
facts about the "missile gap"
from President Kennedy during
last year's political campaign.
The Missouri Democrat made
his charge during Senate debate
over the controversy stirred up
by a private briefing given by De
fence Secretary Robert S. Mc-
Namara which led to newspaper
stories saying no such gap existed
between the United slates and
Russia.
Senate Republican leader Ever
ett M. Dirksen of Illinois said "the
people certainly are entitled to
know" if this is Defense Depart
ment thinking.
Kennedy told a news conference
yesterday that a study of the
"gap" has not been completed and
it was therefore too early to say
if one existed.
In the House, COP leader
Charles A. Halleck of Indiana said
he couldn't quarrel with the Pres
ident's statement that any new
evaluation of the missile situation
would be "premature."
But lie said "I only wish that
in the campaign Mr. Kennedy had
taken the same position of pre
matureness rather than constant
ly downgrading the military pos
ture of the United States."
Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-
Wash., an expert on air power,
said it was essential to define the
term "missile gap." He said the
Russians clearly now have more
operational intercontinental bal
listic missiles than the United
States, but "we do have a missile
deterrent."
