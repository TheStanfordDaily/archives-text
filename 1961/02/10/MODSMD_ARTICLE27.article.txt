# Titan on Target

The Air Eorce early yesterday
fired a Titan missile with an elec
tronic blinker "eye" 5,000 miles
over the Atlantic Ocean in a pre
cision test of its accuracy.
After it had flown about two

minutes, the missile dropped its
booster stage into the ocean and
ignited its upper section. This
triggered a special blinked light
which flashed at twice-a-second
intervals for 1 about one minute.
The flash unit, powered by a
small battery and rated at 22 mil
lion candlepower, left specks of

light as brilliant as the planet
Venus flashes which were re
corded by special ballistic camera.
By analyzing the intervals be
tween the dots and their position
to the stars, "extremely precise
information can be obtained on
, speed and location of the Titan at
i any given instant," scientists said.
