# UCLA, SC Make the Scene For a Little Basketball Action
## 
### 
A weekend ol haskelhall calculated to produce cold chills up
and down the collective spines of the wearers of the Ked is on lap
Ihi s weekend as the nation's munher 8 and number 12 teams in
tlii' form of I S(! ami I (lI.A rcspecti\el\, snarl their \va\ into the
Pavilion lor Rig l i\e contests with Stanford's luckless Indians.

Starting time tor both encoun
ters is at S p.m.
Southern Cal provides tonight's
fun and it would take the most
incurable die-hard to put down
money on Stanford's chances.
I.FI) BY their high-scoring cen
tr John Rudometkin, the boys
from Figueroa Tech have taken
a commanding lead in the cur
rent AAWU basketball race and
spoi l a 15-3 season's mark.
Rudometkin's average of 24.7
points per game makes him the
10th best scorer in the nation and
the 6-6 junior is presently only
19 points shy of the Trojan's
single season record of 463
points.
Behind Rudometkin there is a
balanced attack with forwards
Vein Ashby and Ken Stanley and
guards Chris Appel and Neil Ed
wards.
I'CI-A. though somewhat more

believable, will still provide all
the opposition deemed necessary.
Presently possessing a 13-4 mark,
the Westwoodcrs are second to
their cross-town rivals in the
league race and also have several
hot shooters.
The hottest of these is Ron
Lawson, a (5-1 sophomore, who is
hitting at the rate of 15.2 points
per outing these days from a for
ward spot.
Gary Cunningham, a 6-5 junior
forward, is averaging 14.1 points
per game and holds down the
other forward spot. John Berbe
rieh, the Bruins' 6 8 center, leads
the team in rebounds.
Guards Johnny Green and Bill
Ellis round out the Bruins' stall
ing five.
STANFORD coach Ilowie Dall
mar has no last-minute changes
planned and should go with Ihe
usual starting five consisting of
Mike Ledgerwood at center, John
Windsor and John Hendry at for
wards and Bub Bowling and Don
Clemetson at Hie guards.
The Indians haven't won in
their last three outings, and to
keep from making it five in a
row they'll have to come up with
something in the way of an up
set.
