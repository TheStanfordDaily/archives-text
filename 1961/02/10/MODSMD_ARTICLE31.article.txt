# Wrestlers Host Treasure Is.
## 
### 
The Stanford wrestlers will be
trying to make it two in a row
when they meet Treasure Island
Naval Base tonight in the Encina
Gym at 7:30 p.m.
A victory would even out the
season's win-loss mark at 3-3.
The team has had a ten day lay
off and should be in excellent
shape for the match.
Coacli Jack McKenna had little
advance knowledge on Treasure
Island but said that they had one
returning wrestler, Bob Kleve.
Kleve will meet Frank Redle in
the 167 lit. division in what should
be an excellent match.
The only change in the regular

lineup will be in the 157 lb. divi
sion where Phil Murphy will re
place Pete Barnhisel.
John Flaherty, who pinned his
opponent last week, will be wres
tling in the 130 lb. division.
On Saturday afternoon there
will be a JV-Frosh meet with
Fresno City College at 4:00 p.m.
in Encina Gym. McKenna rates
Fresno as one of the strongest
junior college teams in the area.
In their last meet the Cards
Frosh-JV team lost a very close
decision to Cabrillo College and
they should be up for this meet.
The meet will be the last of the
season for the JV-Frosh team.
