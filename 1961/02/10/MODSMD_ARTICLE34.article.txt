## 
### WARREN SCHLOAT 
The v a rs i t y and freshman
swimming teams, coached by Jim
Gaughran, go into action tomor
row against the Santa Clara
Swim Club at two o'clock in the
Men's pool.
Centered about last Saturday's
winning nucleus of John Jurgen
sen, Tom Redfern, Mike Zeller,
and Paul Uait, ihe Card varsity
will be seeking their second win
of the season in what Jim Gaugh
ran calls "a real tough meet."
TIIK SANTA Clara Swim Club,
led by world record holder Steve
Clark, draws its members chiefly
from the high school swimming
stars in surrounding areas.
Clark, a senior at Los Altos I
high school, is the world record
holder in the 100 yard freestyle
with a time of 48.4. He will be
swimming in the 50 and 100 yard
freestyle events and one of the !
relays.
Along with Clark, Coach George j
Haines has Jerry Maeedo, an
outstanding middle distance free- j
styler.
."MAKCKDO narrowly missed a !
nip to Rome when he finished I
third in the 400 meter Olympic
trials. At this distance, which is
140 yards by American stand-!
ards, Marcedo recently swam a
â€¢1.28. This is a half a minute j
faster than last Saturday's win
ning time.
For the Card Frosh tomorrow I
is the opener of a nine meet :
schedule that includes some of
the leading high school and col
lege teams in the area.
