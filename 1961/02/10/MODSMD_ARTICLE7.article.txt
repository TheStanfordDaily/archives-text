# Married Vote Nixed By LASSU
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
Legislature, lacking a two
thirds affirmative majority, last
night refused to put the question
of LASSU representation for
married students on the spring
election ballot.
The group also granted a con
stitution to the conservative
"Young Americans for Freedom"
group and refused a $200 alloca
tion which would have enabled
the Institute of International Re
lations to purchase two pages of
Monday's Daily for a photo-word
report on the trip taken through
the South over Christmas vaca
tion by African students studying
at Stanford and other Bay Area
schools.
ON THK election matter, pro
ponents of married student rep
resentation on LASSU could mus
ter only 11 votes to put the mat
ter up to the vote of the student
body at spring election.
This was not close to the neces
sary two-thirds vote needed to
place the subject—which would
require a constitutional amend
ment—on the ballot. Six mem
bers voted against the motion.
Stern representative Charles
Lofgren said there was no point
in placing a married student rep
on LASSU. since they have ade
quate representation through iho
several graduate reps already on
Legislature.
Other LASSU members pointed
out that the sizable number of
married students includes both
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents, and that married students
could contribute to LASSU.
THK PROPOSED IIR supple
ment, which has been partially
worked on the past few weeks,
but which has not had copy writ
ten for it, would have cost $200
to enable the IIR to buy two pages
in The Daily.
The money was to have come
from funds given to Averill Har
riman, but returned by him, for
his appearance here last year.
The supplement Monday would
have come the same day as an IIR
open meeting planned to acquaint
students with the trip and the Af
ricans' feelings about it.
The vote on the apropriation
was close, but the "Nayes" had
the edge over the "Ayes."
"THK YOUNG Americans for
Freedom" group was granted ap
proval of its constitution on the
pledge that it would not interfere
with Political Union programs
and responsibilities.
Off-campus representative Tom
Reilly said he thought the body
would lie small, non-activist and
devoted mainly to discussion and
research among its members on
matters of interest to them.
