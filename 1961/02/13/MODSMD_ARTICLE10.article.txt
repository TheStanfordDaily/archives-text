# 120 Faculty Homesites Available Next Month
## 
### 
Stanford will open up another
75 acres of campus land next
month for faculty ami stall
homesites.
A drawing March 9 will deter
mine who gets first choice of the
120 lots in the new subdivision,
and the first 25 will make their
selections. A second meeting
March 14 is expected to complete
the selections.
About 700 eligible University
personnel associate professors
or higher and designated staff
officers — will be notified of the
drawings by letter.
I) E VELOP M 10 N T work on
streets, underground utilities, sew
ers and a three-acre hilltop park
for the area will begin about next
Monday.
A contract for the initial work
has been awarded to Sondgroth
Bros. Construction Co. of Mt.
View. Target date for completion
and the start of home-building is
Aug. 31.
Overall planning of the devel
opment was done by Stanford's
Planning Office.
Known as "Pine Hill No. 2,"
the new subdivision will extend
from the Pine Hill No. 1 residen
tial area southward to Foothill
Boulevard. The area is bounded
on the east by Stanford Avenue
and on the west by faculty homes
along Frenchman's Road.
BESIDES the three-acre hilltop
park, four acres of greenbelt will
border the development along
Stanford Avenue and Foothill
Road. All existing healthy trees
will be preserved.
Streets will follow contours of
the hilly terrain and grading will
be kept at a minimum. Cul-de-sacs
with planted islands are part of

a design intended to discourage
through traffic.
Many lots will have views over
looking Palo Alto, the bay and
the foothills. Lot sizes vary from
about 12,000 to 20,000 square feet.
PINE HILL No. 2 has been de
scribed as "one of the finest sub
divisions to come thrugh our of
fice" by Robert Sturdivant, asso
ciate planner of the Santa Clara
County Planning Department.
Stanford's development costs,
including landscaping and screen
planting in buffer and park areas
as well as for utilities, sewers,
streets, engineering fees and other
expenses, are expected to total
about $600,000.
Those eligible will sign 80-year
leases on their homesites and pay
$102 to $198 annual ground rent,
since the Founding Grant does
not permit University land to be
sold.
Homeowners must pay their
share of the development costs,
however, which will run $2,600 to
$7,600 per lot. Long-term Univer
sity financing also is available
to them.

including landscaping and screen
planting in buffer and park areas
as well as for utilities, sewers,
streets, engineering fees and other
expenses, are expected to total
about $600,000.
Those eligible will sign 80-year
leases on their homesites and pay
$102 to $198 annual ground rent,
since the Founding Grant does
not permit University land to be
sold.
Homeowners must pay their
share of the development costs,
however, which will run $2,600 to
$7,600 per lot. Long-term Univer
sity financing also is available
to them.
Stanford will open up another
75 acres of campus land next
month for faculty ami stall
homesites.
A drawing March 9 will deter
mine who gets first choice of the
120 lots in the new subdivision,
and the first 25 will make their
selections. A second meeting
March 14 is expected to complete
the selections.
About 700 eligible University
personnel associate professors
or higher and designated staff
officers — will be notified of the
drawings by letter.
I) E VELOP M 10 N T work on
streets, underground utilities, sew

A contract for the initial work
has been awarded to Sondgroth
Bros. Construction Co. of Mt.

and the start of home-building is

Known as "Pine Hill No. 2,"
the new subdivision will extend
from the Pine Hill No. 1 residen
tial area southward to Foothill
Boulevard. The area is bounded
on the east by Stanford Avenue
and on the west by faculty homes
along Frenchman's Road.
BESIDES the three-acre hilltop
park, four acres of greenbelt will
border the development along
Stanford Avenue and Foothill
Road. All existing healthy trees
will be preserved.

the hilly terrain and grading will
be kept at a minimum. Cul-de-sacs

a design intended to discourage
through traffic.
Many lots will have views over
looking Palo Alto, the bay and
the foothills. Lot sizes vary from
about 12,000 to 20,000 square feet.
