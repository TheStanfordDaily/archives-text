# Packard Clouds Consumer Picture

### 
Vance Packard, the self-described "reporter of the American
Way of Life." spoke out last \\ ednesday night against what lit'
termed "a revolution of self-indulgence" in the American con
sumer.
In doing so, he again identified himself as a literate person
who has slill not become aware of tin* Industrial Revolution. For
Mr. Packard in his talk uncovered the plot of American manufac
turers to make mone\ by selling non-essential "waste" products to
the gullible consumer.
We will not quarrel with Mr. Packard by stating that there is
no "waste-making," to use his term, in American industry. One
only has to turn on the television to view the excited, super-slick
and often questionable advertising of the pitchman. The stories of
fraud in the repairman fields also perpetuate the claim of waste
in industry.
Mr. Packard's error is that he has enlarged these specifics to
paint a villainous general picture of industry. He attacks the
"planned obsolescence" of manufacturers where merchandise is
designed to break down after a certain short period from poor
construction, forcing the consumer to buy a newer model. What
he forgets in this criticism is that an automobile, an electric range
or a television set are complex machines of many operating parts.
It is rather short-sighted to believe that a brand-new television set
is equal to one that is five years old. We cannot compare these
products of the twentieth century with the pot-bellied stove of the
eighteenth. \ et Mr. Packard refuses to believe that model changes
are only the outward signs of inward improvements.
He also strikes out at the advertising-created desires of con
sumers for products they truly neither need nor desire. He some
what sarcastically hails as "the most remarkable market achieve
ment of our time" the selling of thousands of brassiers to nine- and
ten-year-old girls. \\ 1 iilt- here we may agree with Mr. Packard that
a number of impressionable girls might have been hoaxed by ad
\ertising, we cannot agree with his assumption that all created de
sires are therefore hoaxes. One hundred years ago we did not have
radios, automobiles, motion pietures or instant coffee. We could
probabb do without them today. Yet we cannot class these im
provements upon our life as wasteful, but rather as definite im
provements.
In short, Mr. Packard has indiscriminately lowered a blast at
the motives of American manufacturers while calling for a return
to a pioneer philosophy of life. In attempting to make the issue a
clear one for the consumer he has succeeded in making the buver's
application of a standard of quality more difficult.

the motives of American manufacturers while calling for a return
to a pioneer philosophy of life. In attempting to make the issue a
clear one for the consumer he has succeeded in making the buver's
application of a standard of quality more difficult.
Vance Packard, the self-described "reporter of the American
Way of Life." spoke out last \\ ednesday night against what lit'
termed "a revolution of self-indulgence" in the American con
sumer.
In doing so, he again identified himself as a literate person
who has slill not become aware of tin* Industrial Revolution. For
Mr. Packard in his talk uncovered the plot of American manufac
turers to make mone\ by selling non-essential "waste" products to
the gullible consumer.
We will not quarrel with Mr. Packard by stating that there is
no "waste-making," to use his term, in American industry. One
only has to turn on the television to view the excited, super-slick
and often questionable advertising of the pitchman. The stories of
fraud in the repairman fields also perpetuate the claim of waste
in industry.
Mr. Packard's error is that he has enlarged these specifics to
paint a villainous general picture of industry. He attacks the
"planned obsolescence" of manufacturers where merchandise is
designed to break down after a certain short period from poor
construction, forcing the consumer to buy a newer model. What
he forgets in this criticism is that an automobile, an electric range
or a television set are complex machines of many operating parts.
It is rather short-sighted to believe that a brand-new television set
is equal to one that is five years old. We cannot compare these
products of the twentieth century with the pot-bellied stove of the
eighteenth. \ et Mr. Packard refuses to believe that model changes
are only the outward signs of inward improvements.
He also strikes out at the advertising-created desires of con
sumers for products they truly neither need nor desire. He some
what sarcastically hails as "the most remarkable market achieve
ment of our time" the selling of thousands of brassiers to nine- and
ten-year-old girls. \\ 1 iilt- here we may agree with Mr. Packard that
a number of impressionable girls might have been hoaxed by ad
\ertising, we cannot agree with his assumption that all created de
sires are therefore hoaxes. One hundred years ago we did not have
radios, automobiles, motion pietures or instant coffee. We could
probabb do without them today. Yet we cannot class these im
provements upon our life as wasteful, but rather as definite im
provements.
In short, Mr. Packard has indiscriminately lowered a blast at
the motives of American manufacturers while calling for a return
to a pioneer philosophy of life. In attempting to make the issue a
clear one for the consumer he has succeeded in making the buver's
application of a standard of quality more difficult.
