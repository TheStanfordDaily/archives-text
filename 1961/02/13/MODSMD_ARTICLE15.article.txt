## LASSU Can Look Ridiculous—And Did 
### 
Stanford's student legislature
(I.,ASSU) can look pretty ridicu
lous at times, but its members
really outdid themselves at last
Thursday's meeting.
Lack of space in the news story
precluded our mentioning a few
facts of the meeting which—even
without the editorializing we're
going to do--put the 18 or so
members who were present in a
deservedly unfortunate light.
What riled us most about this
particular meeting was the amaz
ingly routine, offhand manner in
which tho group refused, by a
close but decisive voice vote, to
grant lIR the permission to use
$200 of its own money to put out
a two-page supplement in today's
Daily.
THE supplement would have
told, in words and pictures, the
story of the trip taken through
the deep South during Christmas
vacation by African students at
tending Stanford and other Bay
Area colleges, accompanied by a
few white Stanford students.
lIR has $500 in a fund in Dean
Winhigler's office which comes
from the honorarium given to
Averell Ilarriman when he spoke
here last year, but returned by
him.
The lIR justifiably thought it
had a pretty good case in asking
LASSU to let it use the money for
The Daily supplement, since Dean
Winbigler had no objection to that
use of the funds, and since lIR
felt Stanford students would show
a definite interest in such a re
port.
THE DAILY offered ITR a siza
ble reduction in ad rates and prob
ably would have sustained a slight
loss on the deal—but it, too,
thought the project was well
worth the money.
LASSU's objections took differ
ent shapes. ASSU Vice President
Sandy McCarty said she thought
the subject had been covered ade
quately in discussion groups
around cammis. She aonarcntlv

did not realize that a majority of
tho living groups have NOT had
discussions on the subject.
Ed Cutter, administrative as
sistant to ASSU President Larry
Royse, said he didn't think the
money was coming out of the "ap
propriate" fund. Apparently he
was willing to forego publication
of the supplement because lIR
wanted to commit the horrible
mistake of taking the money out
of what he thought was the
wrong place.
TWO OR three other members
noted that $200 was a lot of
money and presumably voted j
against allowing lIR use of its
own money because of this.
Unfortunately, none of the pro-1
ponents of the matter bothered to I
point out that the project was un i
questionably worthy of $200 and!
that Stanford students undoubted-1
ly would be interested in tho j
story and pictures of something
they seldom, if ever, come in con
tact with, but something which is
a pressing problem to any U.S.
citizen.
We feel that the benefits to be
derived from the supplementi
more than outweigh the $200 cost, i
or the fact that LASSU feels lIR
wanted to tap the wrong fund forj
the monev.
PERHAPS if LASSU members
who voted against the motion had
lived in the South or been on thei
Christmas trip and seen the dig
nity and civil rights of U.S. citi-1
zons trampled on every day, the
outcome of the vote would havej
been different.
Luckily, the ITR members work-'
ing on the project feel it is worth j
so much that they raised the $200;
out of their own pockets and the
supplement is in today's paper]
for the benefit of Stanford stu-l
dents no thanks to LASSU.
All one can hope is that on the;
next important Legislature vote, j
those members who voted against |
the supplement will stop for a
minute and do a little thinking.

(I.,ASSU) can look pretty ridicu
lous at times, but its members
really outdid themselves at last
Thursday's meeting.
Lack of space in the news story
precluded our mentioning a few
facts of the meeting which—even
without the editorializing we're
going to do--put the 18 or so
members who were present in a
deservedly unfortunate light.
What riled us most about this
particular meeting was the amaz
ingly routine, offhand manner in
which tho group refused, by a
close but decisive voice vote, to
grant lIR the permission to use
$200 of its own money to put out
a two-page supplement in today's
Daily.
THE supplement would have
told, in words and pictures, the
story of the trip taken through
the deep South during Christmas
vacation by African students at
tending Stanford and other Bay
Area colleges, accompanied by a
few white Stanford students.
lIR has $500 in a fund in Dean
Winhigler's office which comes
from the honorarium given to
Averell Ilarriman when he spoke
here last year, but returned by
him.
The lIR justifiably thought it
had a pretty good case in asking
LASSU to let it use the money for
The Daily supplement, since Dean
Winbigler had no objection to that
use of the funds, and since lIR
felt Stanford students would show
a definite interest in such a re
port.
THE DAILY offered ITR a siza
ble reduction in ad rates and prob
ably would have sustained a slight
loss on the deal—but it, too,
thought the project was well
worth the money.
LASSU's objections took differ
ent shapes. ASSU Vice President
Sandy McCarty said she thought
the subject had been covered ade
quately in discussion groups
around cammis. She aonarcntlv

did not realize that a majority of
tho living groups have NOT had
discussions on the subject.
Ed Cutter, administrative as
sistant to ASSU President Larry
Royse, said he didn't think the
money was coming out of the "ap
propriate" fund. Apparently he
was willing to forego publication
of the supplement because lIR
wanted to commit the horrible
mistake of taking the money out
of what he thought was the
wrong place.
TWO OR three other members
noted that $200 was a lot of
money and presumably voted j
against allowing lIR use of its
own money because of this.
Unfortunately, none of the pro-1
ponents of the matter bothered to I
point out that the project was un i
questionably worthy of $200 and!
that Stanford students undoubted-1
ly would be interested in tho j
story and pictures of something
they seldom, if ever, come in con
tact with, but something which is
a pressing problem to any U.S.
citizen.
We feel that the benefits to be
derived from the supplementi
more than outweigh the $200 cost, i
or the fact that LASSU feels lIR
wanted to tap the wrong fund forj
the monev.
PERHAPS if LASSU members
who voted against the motion had
lived in the South or been on thei
Christmas trip and seen the dig
nity and civil rights of U.S. citi-1
zons trampled on every day, the
outcome of the vote would havej
been different.
Luckily, the ITR members work-'
ing on the project feel it is worth j
so much that they raised the $200;
out of their own pockets and the
supplement is in today's paper]
for the benefit of Stanford stu-l
dents no thanks to LASSU.
All one can hope is that on the;

the supplement will stop for a
