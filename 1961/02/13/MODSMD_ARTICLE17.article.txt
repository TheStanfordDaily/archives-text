## Report From IIR's Africa Desk: The Southern Tour 
### 
During Stanford University's Christmas va
cation period—December 16 to January 3 six
African and three American students made an
intensive study tour of the American South.
The purpose of the tour is well contained in
a sentence from a letter soliciting funds: "If
African students in the United States are to re
turn to positions of leadership in their respec
tive countries with a sympathetic understand
ing of America, they must obtain a thorough
knowledge of not only the principles but also
the problems of the United States."
THE TOUR itself was suggested by two Af
ricans at Stanford as a means whereby they
could gain direct contact with a domestic prob
lem of international consequence.
The Africans from Stanford on the tour
were: James Maina, Kenya; Lewis Chikwendu,
Nigeria; Michael Ero, Nigeria; and Fred Sav
age, Sierra Leone. The Africans from San Fran
cisco State College were: Henry Chege, Kenya;
and Prince Bamikole Decker, Liberia. The Afri
can students were accompanied by Elon Gilbert,
David Koff, and Arthur Spiegel of the Africa
Desk.
The tour was sponsored by the Africa Desk
and was made possible through financial con

tributions l'rom individuals, foundations, and
churches in the San Francisco Bay Area.
TODAY'S REPORT is a summary of the trip
and its consequences. The itinerary which fol
lows contains approximately one-half of the
contacts made in the South, and the comments
from the participating students and from
Southerners are drawn from a large number
of reports and letters.

the South.

During Stanford University's Christmas va
cation period—December 16 to January 3 six
African and three American students made an
intensive study tour of the American South.
The purpose of the tour is well contained in
a sentence from a letter soliciting funds: "If
African students in the United States are to re
turn to positions of leadership in their respec
tive countries with a sympathetic understand
ing of America, they must obtain a thorough
knowledge of not only the principles but also
the problems of the United States."
THE TOUR itself was suggested by two Af
ricans at Stanford as a means whereby they
could gain direct contact with a domestic prob
lem of international consequence.
The Africans from Stanford on the tour
were: James Maina, Kenya; Lewis Chikwendu,
Nigeria; Michael Ero, Nigeria; and Fred Sav
age, Sierra Leone. The Africans from San Fran
cisco State College were: Henry Chege, Kenya;
and Prince Bamikole Decker, Liberia. The Afri
can students were accompanied by Elon Gilbert,
David Koff, and Arthur Spiegel of the Africa
Desk.
The tour was sponsored by the Africa Desk
and was made possible through financial con

tributions l'rom individuals, foundations, and
churches in the San Francisco Bay Area.
TODAY'S REPORT is a summary of the trip
and its consequences. The itinerary which fol
lows contains approximately one-half of the
contacts made in the South, and the comments
from the participating students and from
Southerners are drawn from a large number
of reports and letters.
The African and American students will pre
sent an open meeting on the tour this evening
at 7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium and will an
swer questions regarding their experiences in
the South.
The following is a partial resume of the tour:

During Stanford University's Christmas va
cation period—December 16 to January 3 six
African and three American students made an
intensive study tour of the American South.
The purpose of the tour is well contained in
a sentence from a letter soliciting funds: "If
African students in the United States are to re
turn to positions of leadership in their respec
tive countries with a sympathetic understand
ing of America, they must obtain a thorough
knowledge of not only the principles but also
the problems of the United States."
THE TOUR itself was suggested by two Af
ricans at Stanford as a means whereby they
could gain direct contact with a domestic prob
lem of international consequence.
The Africans from Stanford on the tour
were: James Maina, Kenya; Lewis Chikwendu,
Nigeria; Michael Ero, Nigeria; and Fred Sav
age, Sierra Leone. The Africans from San Fran
cisco State College were: Henry Chege, Kenya;
and Prince Bamikole Decker, Liberia. The Afri
can students were accompanied by Elon Gilbert,
David Koff, and Arthur Spiegel of the Africa
Desk.
The tour was sponsored by the Africa Desk
and was made possible through financial con

tributions l'rom individuals, foundations, and
churches in the San Francisco Bay Area.
TODAY'S REPORT is a summary of the trip
and its consequences. The itinerary which fol
lows contains approximately one-half of the
contacts made in the South, and the comments
from the participating students and from
Southerners are drawn from a large number
of reports and letters.
The African and American students will pre
sent an open meeting on the tour this evening
at 7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium and will an
swer questions regarding their experiences in
the South.
