(Fred Savage, of Sierra Leone, is a graduate student in Political
Science at Stanford. He took his A.15. in Political Science at Lincoln
University, Pennsylvania, where ho was editor of the Lincolnian, the
university newspaper.)
On the whole the trip to the deep South was highly educational

for me. It is true I could not help
feeling bitter, for a moment, after
I was refused service at the cof
fee shop in New Orleans Inter
national Airport Terminal or ex
press some resentment when
whites scowled or made remarks
at our integrated group as we
went by.
I DEPLOKE southern political
leadership which exploits explo
sive racial problems; I am still
shocked at the attitude of the so
called southern Christian Chur
ches in their acceptance and sup
port of racial discrimination.
Most southern white "liberals"
are lukewarm over race equality,
but there are some who are con
vinced of the unequal syslems
and play leading roles in bring
ing the two peoples together in
spite of the sanctions surround
ing such action.
THE SOUTH must be dragged
up by its heelsâ€”even if this
means a strain on the nature of
the federation; even if it means
that some whites have to openly
espouse the "liberal" cause.
