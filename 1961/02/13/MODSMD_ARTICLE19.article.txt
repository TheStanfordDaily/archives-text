# Tour Praised By Atlantans
## 
### 
(The following comments on the
tour are from John Yungblut of
the Atlanta Friends Society.)
. . . Let me once again commend
the courage and the initiative it
has taken for you to organize and
follow-through on your initial
plan to provide these African stu
dents, in the company of some of
their American fellows, a tour of
the South at this crucial juncture.
Though you must have met
elsewhere with as much counsel
in the direction of postponing
such a trip, as you encountered
in your contacts with people in
Atlanta, you persisted until the
venture became a reality. I'm sure
that you've not regretted that
decision. . . .
