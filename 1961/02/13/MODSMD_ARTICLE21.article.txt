The tour of the American South
was a significant educational ex
perience. The itinerary empha
sized the complexity of segrega
tion. We visited areas represent
ing all levels of Negro develop
ment from the squalid Negro of
Montgomery and the Southern
rural areas to the prosperity of
the Negro in Atlanta.
By interviewing businessmen,
labor leaders, politicians, educa
tors, students, sharecroppers and
ministers we began to understand
the variety of ways in which seg
regation is manifested.
MORE IMPORTANT than the
educational experience was the
value of the tour in terms of Af
rican-American relations. Before
our departure, it was easy for any
member of the group to condemn
the United States as a nation
apostate to the ideals set forth
by its Constitution and advertised
by U.S.I.A. programs in Africa.
Although propaganda depicting
race discrimination in America is
never wholly effective in Africa,
it is frequently substantiated by
our newspapers and magazines.
WE LEFT for the South antici
pating overt hostilit ity and a pos
sibility of physical violence. As
one African prophesied, "We shall j
not be welcome anywhere. We I
shall be met with anger or locks." I

Contrary to our expectations,
we suffered only minor forms of
segregation. We could not eat in
white restaurants or ride in white
taxicabs. However, we dined in
homes of white people, attended
integrated cocktail parties, par
ticipated in integrated discussions
in public meeting halls, and gave
programs in exclusively white
churches. Our treatment by some
Southern whites was convincing
proof that a significant number
would like to accept individuals
on their personal merit.
OUR FINAL reflection was that
while circumstances of the South
ern Negro are often depressing,
prospects for the future are en
couraging. We concluded that the
enforcement of federal laws and
United States moral judgment
will be increasingly uncompromis
ing in the South, that legal and
moral sanction for integration
will stimulate the emergence of
the liberal element which will
allow the Negro a higher level of
aspiration and achievement, and
Negro activities such as the non
violent movement will continue
to produce a gradual elimination
of discrimination. These optimis
tic conclusions and our apprecia
tion of the complexity of the seg
regation problem enabled each
member of the group to view the
i United States with a more patient
understanding. (For the continu
ing results of the tour see "South
ern Tour Members Work on Pro-
