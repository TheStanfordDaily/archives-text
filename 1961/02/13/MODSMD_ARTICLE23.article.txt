# Results of Tour Told To Kenyan in South
## 
### 
(The following excerpt is from a letter to Eliud YVahome, a Kenya
student whom the group met at Philander Smith College, Little Rock.)
Dear Eliud:
. . . You asked whether our study tour would have any effect on
the segregation problem in the South. We think that indirectly it will

| have some effect, in a number
of ways. First, we acted as sort
I of a communications channel for
some people, in that we were
able to tell people who are work
ing for integration in New Or
leans what others in Little Rock
were doing on the same problem,
and so on through the South.
Further, in Montgomery, Ala
bama, we had an unprecedented
interracial meeting with mem
bers of the Chamber of Com
merce--an event which might
open doors to further interracial
meetings of the same nature.
LASTLY, simply by our trav
eling and living together as a
mixed group, Africans and Amer
icans, we were a living symbol to
many Southerners that people of
different races can live together
as brothers.
You asked also whether we
think Negroes could have done
more to combat segregation. It is
difficult to make a general state
ment, for some Negroes have
done little or nothing to help
themselves, while others have
faced social and economic de
struction, even death, to further
their rights.
ON THE WHOLE, however,
we believe that no Negro wants
segregation, and that when given
the opportunity he will strike out
against it. It is true that the
Negro has only recently realized
his power as an economic group,
but we saw in Atlanta, Georgia,
a boycott of white-owned stores
in which more than 93 r / of At
lanta Negroes took partâ€”and this
was during the Christmas season.
THE .SIT-IN demonstrations
are another example of a group
movement among Negroes, one
which demands courage and con
viction to carry out.
Certainly, there is always a
place for more effort in a move
ment to win true equality, and in
this sense we could say that, even
though Negroes have done much,
they must continue to do even
more.
Reverend S. S. Seay, the spir
itual leader of Negroes in Mont
gomery. Alabama, told us he be
lieved that if a person works hard
enough and long enough to ac
complish what In 1 thinks is right.
Providence will provide a place
for him, and grant him success.
THIS IS the challenge and the
task confronting oppressed
peoples everywhere- it is a life
long battle.
You asked whether we think
the segregation problem will be
solved by the States or by the
Federal Government. We believe
that at the present time the Gov
ernments of the States in the
South will do as little as possible
to solve the problem of segre
gation.
Thus, for the next decade or
I two, the Federal Government will

have to use all its moral and
legal sanction to enforce politi
cal, economic, and educational
equality in the South.
PERHAPS then will the Slates
realize that history is working
again-.sl them, and then will they
assume their rightful burden of
securing for Negroes First Class
citizenship. In the meantime, it
remains to the Negroes them
selves, and to a handful of liberal
whites, to lead the Southern
States out of their present state
of irresponsibility . . .
Our best regards to all our
friends at Philander Smith,
Sincerely,
For the touring students,
David Koff
