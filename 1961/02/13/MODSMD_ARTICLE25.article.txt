a Ph.D. in International Agricul
tural Economics :it Stanford. He
is president of the Kenya Students
Organization and of the All-Afri
can Students Union in the Bay
Area.)
When we were welcomed into
Little Rock by Mayor Knoop, 1
started feeling less disheartened
about the South than my intuition
had suggested.
1 asked Mayor Knoop to single
out the most important lesson
that he had learned from the his
toric Little Rock crisis of 1957.
According to him. the importance
of preserving law and order was
assuredly the biggest lesson. Sub
consciously. I guess, I must have
felt assured that we weren't going
to be stoned by street mobs and
riotous rabble-rousers.
1 was further encouraged by
the understanding and integrity
of Mrs. D. Terry and Mrs. Byron
House, both founders of the Little
Rock Women's Emergency Com
mittee. Mrs. Terry expressed her
conviction by saying that "This
segregation is as dead as a corpse
and all we are trying to do is to
bury the body."
MY RAY of hope was better
focused by a brilliant speech
made by Rev. Ralph Abernathy
of Montgomery. Alabama. While
denouncing the Southern tradi
tionalists as "the Southern Phar
aohs." he called upon the
"Ph.D.'s" and the "No D's" to join
the army of freedom in the Great
Democracy. Rev. Abernathy was
and is one of the driving forces
backing up Rev. Martin Luther
King, Jr. In him there are great
hopes.
At times my "ray of hope"
faded. For instance, I was deeply
disappointed by the leadership of
Gov. Orval Faubus. He is nothing
more than a shrewd political op
portunist. I was also dismayed by
the bigotry of the segregationists.
Congressman Amis Guthridge re
fused to see us, saying, "I do not
believe in integrated meetings."
AND SO, as we interviewed
more mayors, police superintend
ents, church ministers, editors,
lawyer s, sharecroppers an d
staunch segregationists the same
pattern was displayed. That is,
while my hopes were strength
ened by the leadership of such
people as the Rev. Martin L. King
Jr., they were frequently blotted
out by the heresy of the "South
ern Pharaohs" and the deplorable
conditions of the sharecroppers.
On the whole I am hopeful. I
am of the opinion that more
Southerners will see the folly of
some of their "white" leaders.
I HOPE that the impact of the
southern liberal movements will
continue to increase as more
whites discover that they cannot
hold back the clock any longer.
Lastly, my best hopes lie in what
Rev. King calls "The New Negro."
More Negroes are getting sick
and tired of the "Old Order" and
they are determined to change it.
Their potential is great and their
momentum will continue to in
crease as more and more Negroes
"join the army of freedom in the
Great Democracy."
