uted a story on the tour for the

I was very impressed with the
thoroughness of your southern
tour. Obviously, no one can learn
all there is to know about Ihe
South's segregation problem or
any other regional problem in a
two-week lour.
But I can't conceive of a sched
ule that would come closer to that
ideal than the one followed by
your group. And I do believe lhat
when Ihe group had completed
this schedule, its members had a j
greater understanding of segrega- j
lion than do most of the people
who live with it.
