# Tour Valuable' Say Southern Newsmen

### 
(The following are comments!
by Roy Reed of the Arkansas Ga
zette about the Southern Tour's
visit to Little Rock.)
It was good for tlie liberals
here. We need all the encourage
ment we can get. But more than
that, talking with people like the
gentlemen from Africa makes us
re-examine our consciences, which
grow ineffective and lax.
We tend to forget during the
periods of calm that our problem
is unsolved. Our problem is a long
way from solution when a man
like Amis Guthridge can com
mand serious public attention by
childishly refusing to meet a for
eign guest.
YOUR TOUR, of course, was
valuable in other ways. It was a
boost for the Negroes here, par
ticularly those fortunate enough
to meet you and your friends. 11
was at least a small prod to the
"moderates," people like the ma
jority of the School Board mem
bers.
Many, many residents of Little
Rock, including some of the most
influential and powerful, profess
to believe that the integration
problem is dead, that token inte
gration is the answer for all time.
ANSWERING questions like
those asked in your meeting with
the School Board must shake
their complacency, no matter how
much they try to evade the ques
tions and avoid thinking about
them.

Rouge State-Times and Morning
Advocate.)
. . . Certainly for those of us
who are Interested and sympa
thetic to your purpose, it is a
pleasant and enlightening experi
ence to meet with and talk with
students from other countries and
particularly with those in pro
grams like yours. Only in such
programs, I think, is there any
hope for broader thinking and
understanding. The weakness, I
would say, is in reaching people
who are already concerned and
sympathetic. Those who should
he exposed to such visits and who
just might be persuaded to drop
some of their prejudices, are the
ones who never attend meetings
sponsored by such groups as the
American Friends Service Com
mittee, A. C. L. tJ. and others. 1
firmly believe such an effort is
worth the try and on this basis
would certainly encourage such
trips as yours. And even those
who wouldn't think of attending
such a meeting might be reached
in newspaper articles and this is
a gain. They might squirm a bit
to see a mixed group traveling to
gether. But it is good that they
squirm a bit. It just might leave
a vulnerable opening for some
later effort.
