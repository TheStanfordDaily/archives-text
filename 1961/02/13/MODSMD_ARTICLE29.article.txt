## The 						Africa Desk—A Response to The Challenge 
### 
TIN: AFRIC A DESK
The articles on this page give a picture of
ihe Africa Desk by describing its successes,
activities and plans for t ho future. This how
ever leaves the very crucial question: Why is
there an Africa Desk?
It is practically a cliche on the University
campus today to suggest that students have
exchanged the idealism of their heritage for

ihe materialism so abundant in our present
society. Indeed one of the most frightening
facts of ihe United States today is that youth
has lost its idealism.
The heavy demands of our institutional so
ciety regulate students to narrow channels of
achievement and the horizons of creative and
meaningful activity often appear lost to the
individual.

The challenge of conquering and settling
America, and of building a great nation con
sumed the energies of our forefathers and from \
depression and war our fathers rose to mate
rial and international success. But today, de
spite the increased demands of our studies and
further opportunity for educational experience,
there is in the student an energy unburned, a
desire unsatisfied.
The Africa Desk was created bv idealism and •

idealism supplies its energy. In its programs
the Africa Desk is opening new channels for
student expression. It invites an idealism, the
intention of which is not to abandon the practi
cal consideration of our society but to demand
instead the application of our academic careers
that we may utilize a discipline of mind and
method, a particular knowledge and an acute
sense of judgment in a commitment to social
action.

The new direction for our latent idealism is
in a living commitment to each opportunity
which challenges us. It is a commitment to
need and is manifest not only in the field c£
international relations, but in domestic issues
and human relations.
11 is in this new direction which the Africa
Desk aims, and it is this direction which the
students of our generation must find to re
vitalize our lives and our nation.
