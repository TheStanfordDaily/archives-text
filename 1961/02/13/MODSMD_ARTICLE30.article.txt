# TEACHERS IN AFRICA
## IIR Job Placement Program Established 
### 
Africa's appeal came to the Stanford Institute of International
Relations in no field more strongly than in the plea for education.
It was in answer to this call tliat the African Desk initiated its i
Graduate Placement Program earl\ last fall. Additional eneoiir- j
agement was jii\cii when a member of President Kennedy's pro-

posed Peace Corps Task Force
heard of our work, and asked the
Africa Desk to report all its find
ings of opportunities currently
available for American Univer
sity graduates to work in Africa.
HUNDREDS OF letters seek
ing information of the number
and location of job opportunities
were sent to political, economic
and educational leaders in vari
ous parts of the world. Ties are
being established with the gov
ernments of many African states
as well as with existing programs
of job placement in the United
States such as the Yale and Co
lumbia programs and the Afri
can-American Institute in Wash
ington, D.C.
The response from these
sources has been enthusiastic.
Encouraging reports have been
received informing us of the need
for more qualified teachers at the
high school and university levels
to teach basic courses in English,
History, Geography, and most of
all the sciences.
VVK WlO RIO given further im
petus by the willingness of some
African states to waive their re
quirement of a Masters degree
for Stanford students to teach
high school as they have done for
Harvard and Yale.
In addition we have learned
that transportation to and from
job locations is available upon
signing a two-year contract. For
those unable to complete a full
two-year schedule, Stanford is ar
ranging a replacement system by
which benefits can still be re
ceived after one year. Housing is
usually provided either free of
charge by the host government or
at a nominal cost. In case the
teacher is married and has chil
dren, travel and living expenses
will be provided for his wife and
children.
The cost of living is such that
high school teachers in Africa
are able to live on a comparative
ly higher plane than here in the
United States. Applicants, how
ever, are counseled that profit
should be no motivation in seek
ing positions since it will be diffi
cult to save much money during
the period of teaching.
At a preliminary meeting for
interested persons last week the
enthusiastic response of students
at Stanford was demonstrated.
Over ninety application blanks
were turned in showing a re
markably qualified group of stu
dents sincerely interested in the
possibilities of teaching in Af
rica. From these, a committee
will select those showing highest
promise for placement in Africa.
The selected individuals will be
offered instruction in various
problems in Africa as well as as
pects of United States' policy
toward Africa of particular rele
vance to their work.

for Stanford students to teach
high school as they have done for
Harvard and Yale.
In addition we have learned
that transportation to and from
job locations is available upon
signing a two-year contract. For
those unable to complete a full
two-year schedule, Stanford is ar
ranging a replacement system by
which benefits can still be re
ceived after one year. Housing is
usually provided either free of
charge by the host government or
at a nominal cost. In case the
teacher is married and has chil
dren, travel and living expenses
will be provided for his wife and
children.
The cost of living is such that
high school teachers in Africa
are able to live on a comparative
ly higher plane than here in the
United States. Applicants, how
ever, are counseled that profit
should be no motivation in seek
ing positions since it will be diffi
cult to save much money during
the period of teaching.
At a preliminary meeting for
interested persons last week the
enthusiastic response of students
at Stanford was demonstrated.
Over ninety application blanks
were turned in showing a re
markably qualified group of stu
dents sincerely interested in the
possibilities of teaching in Af
rica. From these, a committee
will select those showing highest
promise for placement in Africa.
The selected individuals will be
offered instruction in various
problems in Africa as well as as
pects of United States' policy
toward Africa of particular rele
vance to their work.
Africa's appeal came to the Stanford Institute of International
Relations in no field more strongly than in the plea for education.
It was in answer to this call tliat the African Desk initiated its i
Graduate Placement Program earl\ last fall. Additional eneoiir- j
agement was jii\cii when a member of President Kennedy's pro-

posed Peace Corps Task Force
heard of our work, and asked the
Africa Desk to report all its find
ings of opportunities currently
available for American Univer
sity graduates to work in Africa.
HUNDREDS OF letters seek
ing information of the number
and location of job opportunities
were sent to political, economic
and educational leaders in vari
ous parts of the world. Ties are
being established with the gov
ernments of many African states
as well as with existing programs
of job placement in the United
States such as the Yale and Co
lumbia programs and the Afri
can-American Institute in Wash
ington, D.C.
The response from these
sources has been enthusiastic.
Encouraging reports have been
received informing us of the need
for more qualified teachers at the
high school and university levels
to teach basic courses in English,
History, Geography, and most of
all the sciences.
VVK WlO RIO given further im
petus by the willingness of some
African states to waive their re
quirement of a Masters degree
for Stanford students to teach
high school as they have done for
Harvard and Yale.
