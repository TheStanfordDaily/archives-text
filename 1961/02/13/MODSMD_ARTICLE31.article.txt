# Biz Students Plan Nigerian Work Project
## 
### 
Nigeria is the destination of a
j ten-member student team from
j the Stanford Graduate School of
I Business. The group will be par
ticipating in a summer work
project presently being planned
by the Stanford International
Business Club in conjunction
with the Africa Desk.
The proposed project will in
volve a research survey of inter
est to the Nigerian government.
Though the exact topic of the
study has not yet been decided
upon, it will be chosen by the
Nigerian Government probably
in an area relating to opportuni
ties for U.S. investment in Ni
geria. A study of the distribution
channels in Nigeria has also been
suggested as a possible topic.
Details of the project are now
being worked out between the
club, headed by David Korten,
and J. B. Daramola. the Nigerian
Permanent Secretary of Com
merce and Industry, who was re
sponsible for the invitation to
•send approximately ten gradu
ate business students to Nigeria.
I Final plans are contingent up
lon securing financial backing
for the project. Active efforts in
! this regard have been undertaken
j by both the Nigerian Ministry and
I the International Business Club.
| These efforts are being directed
I to various foundations and cor
porations.
The team is to be chosen from
a group of nearly forty appli
cants. All applicants have com
pleted at least one year at Stan
ford's MBA program and several
will receive their Master's de
grees this June. The group rep
resents a wide range of under
| graduate degrees in technical,
social science and humanities
fields. Many of them also have
extensive business, scientific and
military experience.
The final selection of partici
| pants will be based on the appro-
J priateness of the project to their
| vocational goals, academic rec
ord. potential contribution of
thoir past experience to the suc
cess of the project, and general
interest and motivation.
The project is scheduled to be
gin during Spring quarter when
the students chosen for the team
will participate in a special semi
nar given by Dr. William Jones
of the Food Research Institute
dealing with current research on
African economic problems. In
addition, the team members will
work through the Business
School to study the specific eco
nomic problems of Nigeria, gain
a general orientation to living in
Nigeria, and develop the research
techniques which they will use
in their field study.
About June 19, the team will
depart for Nigeria. Current plans
call for also sending a member
of the faculty of the Business
School who will direct the field
work.

I Final plans are contingent up
lon securing financial backing
for the project. Active efforts in
! this regard have been undertaken
j by both the Nigerian Ministry and
I the International Business Club.
| These efforts are being directed
I to various foundations and cor
porations.
The team is to be chosen from
a group of nearly forty appli
cants. All applicants have com
pleted at least one year at Stan
ford's MBA program and several
will receive their Master's de
grees this June. The group rep
resents a wide range of under
| graduate degrees in technical,
social science and humanities
fields. Many of them also have
extensive business, scientific and
military experience.
The final selection of partici
| pants will be based on the appro-
J priateness of the project to their
| vocational goals, academic rec
ord. potential contribution of
thoir past experience to the suc
cess of the project, and general
interest and motivation.
The project is scheduled to be
gin during Spring quarter when
the students chosen for the team
will participate in a special semi
nar given by Dr. William Jones
of the Food Research Institute
dealing with current research on
African economic problems. In
addition, the team members will
work through the Business
School to study the specific eco
nomic problems of Nigeria, gain
a general orientation to living in
Nigeria, and develop the research
techniques which they will use
in their field study.
About June 19, the team will
depart for Nigeria. Current plans
call for also sending a member
of the faculty of the Business
School who will direct the field
work.
Nigeria is the destination of a
j ten-member student team from
j the Stanford Graduate School of
I Business. The group will be par
ticipating in a summer work
project presently being planned
by the Stanford International
Business Club in conjunction
with the Africa Desk.
The proposed project will in
volve a research survey of inter
est to the Nigerian government.
Though the exact topic of the
study has not yet been decided
upon, it will be chosen by the
Nigerian Government probably
in an area relating to opportuni
ties for U.S. investment in Ni
geria. A study of the distribution
channels in Nigeria has also been
suggested as a possible topic.
Details of the project are now
being worked out between the
club, headed by David Korten,
and J. B. Daramola. the Nigerian
Permanent Secretary of Com
merce and Industry, who was re
sponsible for the invitation to
•send approximately ten gradu
ate business students to Nigeria.
