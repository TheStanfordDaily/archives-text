### 
(The following is the letter re
ceived from UN Secretary-Gen
eral Dag Hammarskjold.)
Thank you for your letter of
22 November informing me of
the new steps being taken by the
Institute of International Rela
tions of Stanford University
which reflect the growing inter
est of Stanford students in Af
rica.
I find all such developments
encouraging, for the problems
and affairs of Africa are of uni
versal concern and they must be
very much on the minds and in
the understanding of all of us in
the years ahead.
May I wish you full success
with your new program.
Sincerely yours.
Dag Hammarskjold
Secretarv-Oeneral

from a letter received from Ken
yan Tom Mboya.)
I am not only willing but very
anxious to make any contribu
tion and provide any assistance
that I can in your programme. I
am impressed by the exchange
programme which you discussed
in the enclosed leaflet and if
there is anything I can do di
rectly, you can rest assured it
will be done. You are no doubt
aware of my own keenness to
help in a student programme and
the part I have played in the re
cent students' airlift and conse
quently I would not hesitate to
bo associated with your pro
gramme.
Yours sincerely,
T. J. Mboya, M.L.C.
