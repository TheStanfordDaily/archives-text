# African Universities Welcome Exchange
## 
### 
Although only 12 years old.
the University College at Ibadan
in Nigeria, with its generous en
dowments of both stall and fa
cilities, looks forward to rapid
expansion, in meeting the higher
academic needs of the three re
gions of Nigeria.
With 1,114 students and an im
pressive expansion rate of almost
ten percent per year, Ibadan
promises to be one of the most
important universities in Africa.
An excerpt from the Univer
sity College reply to the Stan
ford exchange proposal said:
"In principle, the proposal is
most welcome to us. Our own
students will be delighted to have
students from your University
while they themselves will be too
pleased to avail themselves of a
similar opportunity to be received
at Stanford . . . We would like
to know what financial arrange
ments are being made for your
students and our students who
may be travelling on this pro
gramme."
Makerere College, the Univer
sity of East Africa, which was
founded in 1922, and reconstitut
ed in 1934 as an inter-territorial
institution, intended to develop
into a University of East Africa.
Like Ibadan, Makerere enjoys a
special relationship with the Uni
versity of London.
The 880 students come from 98
different peoples, and include
some 50 Asians and Europeans.
Makerere College replied in
part:
"S t u d en t exchanges of the
type suggested can be very valu
able though it is not always easy
to establish and maintain at reg
ular yearly intervals . . . |The
President of our Student Guild |
has now submitted to me two
names and I am taking up with
their academic advisors the ques
tion of the suitability of either of
these candidates for the scholar
ship."
The University College of Rho
desia and Nyasaland received its
charter in 1955, and first took in
students in March 1957. It is built
on a site of 474 acres, and the
building program has so far in
cluded faculties for arts, science,
agriculture and education, ad
ministrative block, lecture the
atre, three residence halls, and a
library planned for 350,000 vol
umes and 250 readers.
Walter Adams, Principal of the
University College of Rhodesia
and Nyasaland, said in his re
ply:
"I have discussed the suggested
exchange with the officers of our
Students' Union who welcome the
proposal and hope lhat we may
be able to share in it. There are,
however, some practical difficul
ties which may prove to be seri
ous. . . . (However) we are very
interested and would like to see
(the exchange) achieved in prac
tice."
University College of Ghana:
A prospectus has not yet been
received from the University Col
lege of Ghana, but a spokesman
for the institution replied in a
letter that "I nm happy to inform
you that tlie* College has agreed
in principle to implement the sug
gested s t u d cut- exchange pro

gramme as adumbrated in your
letter."
Four African universities have
responded favorably to the Afri
can Desk's inquires concerning a
student exchange program.
The four universities are the
University College of Ibadan Ni
geria, IVlakerere College of East
Africa, the University College of
Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and the
University College of Ghana.
The Africa Desk hopes to ex
change one student with each of
ihese universities during the 1961-
62 school vear.
