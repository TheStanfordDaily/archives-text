University and high school text

colleges were contacted. Letters
were sent to book publishing
firms and the State Board of Ed
ucation requesting surplus or dis
continued books.
As the drive progressed, the
African Desk learned some Afri
can countries are in need of pri
mary school books, or non-text
books. The drive was broadened.
Near the middle of spring quar
ter, the African Desk hopes to
ship 100,000 books of all kinds to
Africa.
TO DATE the African Desk has
collected 15,000 books from col
leges, high schools, book publish

the near future the African Desk
plans to contact colleges and uni

an effort to ship 100,000 books by

close of spring quarter, but the
African Desk hopes that the way
will have been opened for con
tinued shipment of books to
