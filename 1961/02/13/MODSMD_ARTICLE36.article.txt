Several members of the
Africa Desk under the direc
tion of Mr. Peter Duignan,
Curator of Hoover Institute's
Africa Collection, are index
ing the extensive collection of
Africa-related periodicals re
ceived by the Stanford li
braries.
The result of this work will

Africa Index, published by
the Hoover Institute under
the name ol the lIR. The In

favorable reception, however,
