# IIR SPONSORS PROGRAM
## Desk Promotes Better Understanding of Africa 
### 
In response to a growing stu
dent interest in Africa and to a
desire to encourage more ra
j tional understanding of the rap
idly changing situations in the
continent, the Africa Desk has
initiated a series of formal ad
dresses by notable personalities
associated with Africa and a sup
plementary program of smaller
discussion groups within the va
rious campus residences.
The emphasis throughout has
been to stimulate and maintain a
continuing interest in Africa
among the student body rather
than to deal solely with events of
timely but passing interest.
THK PROGRAM has also
served to make more extensive
use of the numerous individuals,
students, faculty, etc.. in the Bay
Area and visitors to the Stanford
campus who are knowledgeable
about Africa.
During the autumn quarter
19G0, major all-campus presenta
tions included the following:
1) An address by Mr. Odero-
Jowi, professor of economics at
the African Labor College in
Uganda and member of the UN
Economic Commission for Af
rica, on the subject "The Ele
ments of African Nationalist
Movements."
2) A panel discussion on "The
Role of the United Nations in
Africa" whose participants were
Dr. Bruce Johnston of the Stan
ford Food Research Institute,
Mr. Fred Savage of Sierra Leone,
and Mr. Jean Pierre Dutry of
Belgium.
31 The African Forum—"Mul
tiracialism in Africa" which in
cluded an opening address by Mr.
Geoffry Pardy management con
sultant and member of the Cen
tral African Party in Southern
Rhodesia; a panel discussion by
representatives of the various
races and countries of East, Cen
tral and South Africa; and dis
cussion groups on specific sub
jects-social. political, and eco
nomic.
PROGRAMS during winter
quarter began with the visit of
Reverend William S. Coffin,
Chaplin of Yale University, and
group leader in last summer's
Crossroads Africa program. Rev
erend Coffin made a very inspir
ing appeal for students to teach
in secondary schools in Africa.
Following the all campus pres
entation on the African student's
tour of the Southern United
States, the African Desk has ar
ranged for an address by Sir Ar
den Clarke, former Governor-
General of Ghana, on April 11
of this year. Finances permit
ling, other programs include
| Colonel Beuchner to speak "on
j "The Myth of African National
' ism." and Mr. Nigel Haseltine of
; the Food and Agricultural Or
ganization of the United Nations.

PARTICULAR stress has been
laid upon the smaller group dis
cussions as a manifestation of
the desire of several students to
gain a more systematic and thor
ough knowledge of Africa. Bi
weekly dinner discussions were
organized in several residences at
their request and guest experts
are provided for every meeting.
The eight African students at
tending Stanford have been the
most valuable and constant par
ticipants in this program. Then
presence and interest has been in
i formative and efficacious in stim
ulating understanding and friend
ship.
MOST outstanding of group dis
cussions was the International
Center's Tuesday lunch program.
Under the direction of Mr. Fred
Ziegler, foreign student advisor,
and Jim Maina, Stanford student
from Kenya, the 15 participants
discussed a wide range of topics
related to Africa including colo
nialism, communism and econ
omy.
The program was invaluably
supplemented by faculty from
Stanford and visitors to the cam
pus from Africa including Mr.
Ngobi, political leader from
Uganda and the editor of the Af
rique Novelle, a prominent news
paper in West Africa.
VISITORS to Stanford from Af
rica have attended various living
group discussions whenever pos
sible. We have been fortunate to
have among our guests Mr. and
Mrs. Smuts, rector of the Univer
sity of Pretoria in South Africa,
Mr. Patrick Alton, foreign cor
respondent for 16 English-speak
ing newspapers in South and Cen
tral Africa, Mr. Richard Lake of
the Provincional Education Office
in Kenya, and others from Ni
geria and Angola.
Requests for programs have
have also come from numerous
sources in the San Francisco area.
Presentations on a variety of sub
jects have been made to the
YWCA adult education class in
Palo Alto, the night class on Af
rica at the Menlo-Atherton High
School, etc., and numerous talks
have been given to groups re
porting upon the African students
tour in the South.
PART OF the success of the ex
change program will depend upon
the opportunities the African stu
dents attending Stanford have to
make their stay in America a full,
and valuable one.
Toward this end, the African
Desk approached the African stu
dents at Stanford to discover
ways and means by which these
students might be aided in gain
ing experience in and knowledge
about their respective special in
terests and about American life
in general.

sult was the African students

PROGRAMS during winter
quarter began with the visit of
Reverend William S. Coffin,
Chaplin of Yale University, and
group leader in last summer's
Crossroads Africa program. Rev
erend Coffin made a very inspir
ing appeal for students to teach
in secondary schools in Africa.
Following the all campus pres
entation on the African student's
tour of the Southern United
States, the African Desk has ar
ranged for an address by Sir Ar
den Clarke, former Governor-
General of Ghana, on April 11
of this year. Finances permit
ling, other programs include
| Colonel Beuchner to speak "on
j "The Myth of African National
' ism." and Mr. Nigel Haseltine of
; the Food and Agricultural Or
ganization of the United Nations.

PARTICULAR stress has been
laid upon the smaller group dis
cussions as a manifestation of
the desire of several students to
gain a more systematic and thor
ough knowledge of Africa. Bi
weekly dinner discussions were
organized in several residences at
their request and guest experts
are provided for every meeting.
The eight African students at
tending Stanford have been the
most valuable and constant par
ticipants in this program. Then
presence and interest has been in
i formative and efficacious in stim
ulating understanding and friend
ship.
MOST outstanding of group dis
cussions was the International
Center's Tuesday lunch program.
Under the direction of Mr. Fred
Ziegler, foreign student advisor,
and Jim Maina, Stanford student
from Kenya, the 15 participants
discussed a wide range of topics
related to Africa including colo
nialism, communism and econ
omy.
The program was invaluably
supplemented by faculty from
Stanford and visitors to the cam
pus from Africa including Mr.
Ngobi, political leader from
Uganda and the editor of the Af
rique Novelle, a prominent news
paper in West Africa.
VISITORS to Stanford from Af
rica have attended various living
group discussions whenever pos
sible. We have been fortunate to
have among our guests Mr. and
Mrs. Smuts, rector of the Univer
sity of Pretoria in South Africa,
Mr. Patrick Alton, foreign cor
respondent for 16 English-speak
ing newspapers in South and Cen
tral Africa, Mr. Richard Lake of
the Provincional Education Office
in Kenya, and others from Ni
geria and Angola.
Requests for programs have
have also come from numerous
sources in the San Francisco area.
Presentations on a variety of sub
jects have been made to the
YWCA adult education class in
Palo Alto, the night class on Af
rica at the Menlo-Atherton High
School, etc., and numerous talks
have been given to groups re
porting upon the African students
tour in the South.
PART OF the success of the ex
change program will depend upon
the opportunities the African stu
dents attending Stanford have to
make their stay in America a full,
and valuable one.
Toward this end, the African
Desk approached the African stu
dents at Stanford to discover
ways and means by which these
students might be aided in gain
ing experience in and knowledge
about their respective special in
terests and about American life
in general.
The most outstanding single re
sult was the African students
tour of the South.
In response to a growing stu
dent interest in Africa and to a
desire to encourage more ra
j tional understanding of the rap
idly changing situations in the
continent, the Africa Desk has
initiated a series of formal ad
dresses by notable personalities
associated with Africa and a sup
plementary program of smaller
discussion groups within the va
rious campus residences.
The emphasis throughout has
been to stimulate and maintain a
continuing interest in Africa
among the student body rather
than to deal solely with events of
timely but passing interest.
THK PROGRAM has also
served to make more extensive
use of the numerous individuals,
students, faculty, etc.. in the Bay
Area and visitors to the Stanford
campus who are knowledgeable
about Africa.
During the autumn quarter
19G0, major all-campus presenta
tions included the following:

Uganda and the editor of the Af
rique Novelle, a prominent news
paper in West Africa.
VISITORS to Stanford from Af
rica have attended various living
group discussions whenever pos
sible. We have been fortunate to
have among our guests Mr. and
Mrs. Smuts, rector of the Univer
sity of Pretoria in South Africa,
Mr. Patrick Alton, foreign cor
respondent for 16 English-speak
ing newspapers in South and Cen
tral Africa, Mr. Richard Lake of
the Provincional Education Office
in Kenya, and others from Ni
geria and Angola.
Requests for programs have
have also come from numerous
sources in the San Francisco area.
Presentations on a variety of sub
jects have been made to the
YWCA adult education class in
Palo Alto, the night class on Af
rica at the Menlo-Atherton High
School, etc., and numerous talks
have been given to groups re
porting upon the African students
tour in the South.
PART OF the success of the ex
change program will depend upon
the opportunities the African stu
dents attending Stanford have to
make their stay in America a full,
and valuable one.
Toward this end, the African
Desk approached the African stu
dents at Stanford to discover
ways and means by which these
students might be aided in gain
ing experience in and knowledge
about their respective special in
terests and about American life
in general.
The most outstanding single re
sult was the African students
tour of the South.
In response to a growing stu
dent interest in Africa and to a
desire to encourage more ra
j tional understanding of the rap
idly changing situations in the
continent, the Africa Desk has
initiated a series of formal ad
dresses by notable personalities
associated with Africa and a sup
plementary program of smaller
discussion groups within the va
rious campus residences.
The emphasis throughout has
been to stimulate and maintain a
continuing interest in Africa
among the student body rather
than to deal solely with events of
timely but passing interest.
THK PROGRAM has also
served to make more extensive
use of the numerous individuals,
students, faculty, etc.. in the Bay
Area and visitors to the Stanford
campus who are knowledgeable
about Africa.
During the autumn quarter
19G0, major all-campus presenta
tions included the following:
1) An address by Mr. Odero-
Jowi, professor of economics at
the African Labor College in
Uganda and member of the UN
Economic Commission for Af
rica, on the subject "The Ele
ments of African Nationalist
Movements."
2) A panel discussion on "The
Role of the United Nations in
Africa" whose participants were
Dr. Bruce Johnston of the Stan
ford Food Research Institute,
Mr. Fred Savage of Sierra Leone,
and Mr. Jean Pierre Dutry of
Belgium.
31 The African Forum—"Mul
tiracialism in Africa" which in
cluded an opening address by Mr.
Geoffry Pardy management con

tral African Party in Southern
Rhodesia; a panel discussion by
representatives of the various
races and countries of East, Cen
tral and South Africa; and dis
cussion groups on specific sub
jects-social. political, and eco
nomic.
PROGRAMS during winter
quarter began with the visit of
Reverend William S. Coffin,
Chaplin of Yale University, and
group leader in last summer's
Crossroads Africa program. Rev
erend Coffin made a very inspir
ing appeal for students to teach
in secondary schools in Africa.
Following the all campus pres
entation on the African student's
tour of the Southern United
States, the African Desk has ar
ranged for an address by Sir Ar
den Clarke, former Governor-

of this year. Finances permit
ling, other programs include
| Colonel Beuchner to speak "on
j "The Myth of African National
' ism." and Mr. Nigel Haseltine of
; the Food and Agricultural Or
ganization of the United Nations.

PARTICULAR stress has been
laid upon the smaller group dis
cussions as a manifestation of
the desire of several students to
gain a more systematic and thor
ough knowledge of Africa. Bi
weekly dinner discussions were
organized in several residences at
their request and guest experts
are provided for every meeting.
The eight African students at
tending Stanford have been the
most valuable and constant par
ticipants in this program. Then
presence and interest has been in
i formative and efficacious in stim
ulating understanding and friend
ship.
MOST outstanding of group dis
cussions was the International
Center's Tuesday lunch program.
Under the direction of Mr. Fred
Ziegler, foreign student advisor,
and Jim Maina, Stanford student
from Kenya, the 15 participants
discussed a wide range of topics
related to Africa including colo
nialism, communism and econ
omy.
The program was invaluably
supplemented by faculty from
Stanford and visitors to the cam
pus from Africa including Mr.
Ngobi, political leader from
Uganda and the editor of the Af
