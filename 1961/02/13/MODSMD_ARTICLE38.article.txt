# SU-Africa Student Exchanges Planned
## 
### 
i
The Africa Desk is arranging
a new program of student ex
changes with six universities in
English speaking Africa to begin
in the fall of 1961. The program
will provide not only a unique
opportunity for education, but
also the context for mutual un
derstanding and respect between
the United States and the emer
gent nation of Africa.
Six highly qualified Stanford

undergraduates will study at Af
rican colleges, and a student from
each African college will study
here. To this dae, Makerere Col
lege, the University of East Af
rica, the University College of
Ghana, the University College
Ibadan, Nigeria, and University
College of Rhodesia and Nyasa
land have all l-eplied to our pro
posals for the exchange.
Officials of these colleges have
given sanction to the project and
Student Guilds have expressed
their interest.
Acting promptly, Makerere
College has already begun the
selection of their candidate for
the exchange, and all colleges are
working on the administrative de
tails of the project. Financing for
the exchange is presently being
sought and tiie success of the
program depends ultimately on
the success of solicitation for
funds.
African Student at Stanford
African exchange students, in
addition to a regular academic
schedule, will be invited to share
the work of the Africa Desk and
to participate in programs of lec
ture, discussion and social con
tact to increase American knowl
edge of Africa. (See Home Edu
cation.) Further, opportunities
will be available to the student
for increasing his own knowledge
| of American life through study
trips and work projects. (See

| Southern Tour and Host Com
mittee. ) The African students
will ho primarily graduates he
cause of difficulties in accredit
ing American courses in a Brit
ish educational system and will
be selected to make full use of
the broad but flexible program.
Stanford Exchange Students
Preliminary Selection
Thirteen Stanford undergradu
ates were selected from over fifty
applicants for the exchange proj
ect in an initial screening process.
A committee composed of a Dean
of Men, a Dean of Women, a
faculty member and both Afri
can and American students grad
ed the applicants on academic
ability, maturity, and manifest
objectives and interest in Africa.
Preference was given the ex
ceptional younger students who
would return to Stanford to bring
their stimulation and experiences
to the Africa Desk program;
every student will return to Stan
ford for at least one quarter after
his year in Africa to share his
knowledge and experience with
the campus.
Training and Final Selection
A demanding three-part train
ing program conducted by facul
ty members is designed to pre
pare Stanford students for living
and for intelligent study in Afri
ca, and for answering questions
about the United States.
Each student will enroll in a
special interdepartmental course
arranged for Spring Quarter by
Dr. Jones of Stanford's Food Re
search Institute. Regular reading
and discussion will be supple
mented by presentation of cur
rent research papers by leading
African scholars in the San Fran
cisco area. In addition, possibili
ties for a summary course of the
basic facts and concepts Ameri
can economics, history, political
science, an dforeign policyâ€”is be
ing explored. The State Depart
ment has offered assistance to
this proposal through a briefing
in U.S. foreign policy in Africa.
Finally, a smaller seminar has
been started which deals with
less sophisticated material in
Africa, the selected students will
focus on their own particular
country in Africa and will orient
their study to their own academic
discipline.
The course is supervised by
Mr. Peter Duignan. Africa Cura
tor for Hoover Institute. The fac
ulty-student committee will make
final selections in early spring
from performances in this pro
gram, which has already begun.
Accredidation for the training
program will be sought through
Stanford.
Stanford Students in Africa
Stanford students will be ex
pected to engage in a broad pro
gram of social and cultural con
tact in addition to maintaining a
full academic load. Present plans
include: participation in univer
sity life in Africa plus periodical
reports on current events for
Stanford; independent research
outside the college environment
for preparation of a study paper
on a topic prearranged with the
student's Stanford advisor for
presentation on return. Accredi
dation channels will be estab
lished before the initial exchange.
Cultural Exchange
In an effort to stimulate com
munication between Stanford and
African universities, a subscrip
tion to the Stanford Daily has
been sent to each college.
(Contributions Nceded
Substantial contributions of
funds are necessary to the realiza
tion of the African exchange pro
gram. Several charitable founda
tions arc being asked to contrib
ute a major portion of the funds
required. Although the amount
which might be contributed by
foundations cannot be predicted,
several have indicated a disposi
tion ot lend financial support to
student exchange and to pro
grams 1o promote friendly rela
tions between the United States
and the peoples of Africa. Com
mitments from these foundations
have not been obtained, but their
enthusiastic endorsement of the
African program at Stanford pro
vides cause for restrained opti
mism.
It will be necessary to obtain a
significant portion of the neces
sary funds from interested groups
and individuals. All money con
tributed is administered by the
University. Contributions may be
made directly to the University
and are deductible from taxable
! income in the same manner as
| other charitable contributions.
