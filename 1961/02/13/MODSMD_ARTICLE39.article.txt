# Stanford Cagers Lose-Win
## Hot-Shooting Redmen Down Bruins, 79-65 
### ART ROBINSON 
The hottest shooting bunch of
Stanford Indian basketballers to
come along in a coon's age put
on a dazzling scoring show as the
Card cagers out-offensed the
UCLA Bruins Saturday night in
the Pavilion by 79-65.
Big junior forward John Wind
sor had tho best night of his ca
reer, canning a fabulous 30 points,
mostly on long jump shots and
driving hooks, to pace the produc
tion.
T H IN G S started out with a
bang when the hot-handed Indians
sank their first eight shots from
the field. Don Clcmetson com
menced action with a 20-footer
from the corner, and by the time
Windsor dropped in his second
jump shot the Cards were out to
a fast 16-7 lead with only five
minutes gone.
It was not always so easy for
the Tribe cagers. though; they
had to fight all the way. After
holding a 10-point margin, 19-9, a
third of the way through the first
half, Stanford allowed the relent
less Bruins to close to within four
markers, 28-32, on two close in
fielders by jumping-jack forward
Ron Lawson, a free toss by big
John Berberich, and a sweet 15-
foot jumper from the corner by
Johnny Green.
But the Indians extended their
margin to 36-30 on a free throw
by John Hendry and a three
point play by Windsor.
AFTER the intermission, the
Cards extended their lead to 56-

In action over the weekend, the
Stanford frosh cagers drubbed the
San Jose State freshmen, 69-38, on
Friday and bounced Santa Hosa
77-5!), on Saturday. See tomor
row's Daily for stories on these
contests.

41 with seven minutes gone as
Windsor hit a hot streak and
canned a quick 13 counters.
Then the Uclans slowly pulled
back until, with four and a half
minutes left, the Redmen's mar
gin was cut to 69-65 on two free
throws by forward Gary Cunning
ham and a 20-foot set shot by
Brian Kniff.
But the local disciples of the
roundball came up with ten digits,
mostly on free throws, while hold
ing the Uclans to none for the
rest of the contest to garner the
win.
Center Mike Ledgerwood sank
two charity tosses. Clemetson hit
two more, Phil Kelley made a
neat five-footer off a fast break,
Windsor hit two from the foul
line, and Kelley canned a 15-foot
jumper from the side with sec

onds left to give the Tribe its
final margin.
TIIE WIN over the Bruins
marked the first victory for the
Cards since they turned back the
Washington Huskies in a 61-58
overtime thriller three weeks ago,
and brought Stanford into a tie
with the Uclans for third place
in the Big Five with identical 3-3
marks.
USC is resting in the top spot
with a 6-1 mark; Washington is
in second, having won five of
nine; UCLA and Stanford are
3-3; and California has a 0-6 rec
ord.
It was also the first time the
Tribe has defeated UCLA in two
years. The last Card win over the
Bruins came almost two years
ago to the day when Stanford
took a 69-61 decision in the Pa
vilion.
Windsor was the night's top
point-maker, stuffing in 30 count
ers. The big forward hit on 12
of 19 field goal tries and convert
ed 6 out of 8 free tosses to ac
count for his score-and-a-half of
points.
WINDSOR was tough on the
boards, too, grabbing 10 loose
balls to tie with Ledgerwood for
ball retrieving honors.
Clemetson had four fielders and
seven free throws for a total of
15 points to grab the second spot
among Card scorers. Hendry
tanked 11 markers, and Bub

Bowling eight to help the Tribe
cause.
Stanford shot a torrid 27 for
55 (.491) from the field and a less
spectacular .7:18 from the free
throw line (25x33). UCLA put
the ball through the hoop at as
nearly a good rate. .419 on 26 of
62 field goal attempts, but hit a
miserable .565 (13x23) on free
throws to help lose the game.
For the Bruins, Lawson ac
counted for 22 points on nine field
goals and four charity throws.
The UCLA flash also picked up
10 rebounds to top Bruin board
hounds.

FORWARD JOHN WINDSOR SCORINC 2 OF HIS 30 POINTS
The big junior drives for a layin past John Berberich
The hottest shooting bunch of
Stanford Indian basketballers to
come along in a coon's age put
on a dazzling scoring show as the
Card cagers out-offensed the
UCLA Bruins Saturday night in
the Pavilion by 79-65.
Big junior forward John Wind
sor had tho best night of his ca
reer, canning a fabulous 30 points,
mostly on long jump shots and
driving hooks, to pace the produc
tion.
T H IN G S started out with a
bang when the hot-handed Indians
sank their first eight shots from
the field. Don Clcmetson com
menced action with a 20-footer
from the corner, and by the time
Windsor dropped in his second
jump shot the Cards were out to
a fast 16-7 lead with only five
minutes gone.
It was not always so easy for
the Tribe cagers. though; they
had to fight all the way. After
holding a 10-point margin, 19-9, a
third of the way through the first
half, Stanford allowed the relent
less Bruins to close to within four
markers, 28-32, on two close in
fielders by jumping-jack forward
Ron Lawson, a free toss by big
John Berberich, and a sweet 15-
foot jumper from the corner by
Johnny Green.
But the Indians extended their
margin to 36-30 on a free throw
by John Hendry and a three
point play by Windsor.
AFTER the intermission, the
Cards extended their lead to 56-

In action over the weekend, the
Stanford frosh cagers drubbed the
San Jose State freshmen, 69-38, on
Friday and bounced Santa Hosa
77-5!), on Saturday. See tomor
row's Daily for stories on these
contests.

41 with seven minutes gone as
Windsor hit a hot streak and
canned a quick 13 counters.
Then the Uclans slowly pulled
back until, with four and a half
minutes left, the Redmen's mar
gin was cut to 69-65 on two free
throws by forward Gary Cunning
ham and a 20-foot set shot by
Brian Kniff.
But the local disciples of the
roundball came up with ten digits,
mostly on free throws, while hold
ing the Uclans to none for the
rest of the contest to garner the
win.
Center Mike Ledgerwood sank
two charity tosses. Clemetson hit
two more, Phil Kelley made a
neat five-footer off a fast break,
Windsor hit two from the foul
line, and Kelley canned a 15-foot
jumper from the side with sec

onds left to give the Tribe its
final margin.
TIIE WIN over the Bruins
marked the first victory for the
Cards since they turned back the
Washington Huskies in a 61-58
overtime thriller three weeks ago,
and brought Stanford into a tie
with the Uclans for third place
in the Big Five with identical 3-3
marks.
USC is resting in the top spot
with a 6-1 mark; Washington is
in second, having won five of
nine; UCLA and Stanford are
3-3; and California has a 0-6 rec
ord.
It was also the first time the
Tribe has defeated UCLA in two
years. The last Card win over the
Bruins came almost two years
ago to the day when Stanford
took a 69-61 decision in the Pa
vilion.
Windsor was the night's top
point-maker, stuffing in 30 count
ers. The big forward hit on 12
of 19 field goal tries and convert
ed 6 out of 8 free tosses to ac
count for his score-and-a-half of
points.
WINDSOR was tough on the
boards, too, grabbing 10 loose
balls to tie with Ledgerwood for
ball retrieving honors.
Clemetson had four fielders and
seven free throws for a total of
15 points to grab the second spot
among Card scorers. Hendry
tanked 11 markers, and Bub

cause.

FORWARD JOHN WINDSOR SCORINC 2 OF HIS 30 POINTS
The big junior drives for a layin past John Berberich
The hottest shooting bunch of
Stanford Indian basketballers to
come along in a coon's age put
on a dazzling scoring show as the
Card cagers out-offensed the
UCLA Bruins Saturday night in
the Pavilion by 79-65.
Big junior forward John Wind
sor had tho best night of his ca
reer, canning a fabulous 30 points,
mostly on long jump shots and
driving hooks, to pace the produc
tion.
T H IN G S started out with a
bang when the hot-handed Indians
sank their first eight shots from
the field. Don Clcmetson com
menced action with a 20-footer
from the corner, and by the time
Windsor dropped in his second
jump shot the Cards were out to
a fast 16-7 lead with only five
minutes gone.
It was not always so easy for
the Tribe cagers. though; they
had to fight all the way. After
holding a 10-point margin, 19-9, a
third of the way through the first
half, Stanford allowed the relent
less Bruins to close to within four
markers, 28-32, on two close in
fielders by jumping-jack forward
Ron Lawson, a free toss by big
John Berberich, and a sweet 15-
foot jumper from the corner by
Johnny Green.
But the Indians extended their
margin to 36-30 on a free throw
by John Hendry and a three
point play by Windsor.
AFTER the intermission, the
Cards extended their lead to 56-

In action over the weekend, the
Stanford frosh cagers drubbed the
San Jose State freshmen, 69-38, on
Friday and bounced Santa Hosa
77-5!), on Saturday. See tomor
row's Daily for stories on these
contests.

41 with seven minutes gone as
Windsor hit a hot streak and
canned a quick 13 counters.
Then the Uclans slowly pulled
back until, with four and a half
minutes left, the Redmen's mar
gin was cut to 69-65 on two free
throws by forward Gary Cunning
ham and a 20-foot set shot by
Brian Kniff.
But the local disciples of the
roundball came up with ten digits,
mostly on free throws, while hold
ing the Uclans to none for the
rest of the contest to garner the
win.
Center Mike Ledgerwood sank
two charity tosses. Clemetson hit
two more, Phil Kelley made a
neat five-footer off a fast break,
Windsor hit two from the foul
line, and Kelley canned a 15-foot
jumper from the side with sec

onds left to give the Tribe its
final margin.
TIIE WIN over the Bruins
marked the first victory for the
Cards since they turned back the
Washington Huskies in a 61-58
overtime thriller three weeks ago,
and brought Stanford into a tie
with the Uclans for third place
in the Big Five with identical 3-3
marks.
USC is resting in the top spot
with a 6-1 mark; Washington is
in second, having won five of
nine; UCLA and Stanford are
3-3; and California has a 0-6 rec
ord.
It was also the first time the
Tribe has defeated UCLA in two
years. The last Card win over the
Bruins came almost two years
ago to the day when Stanford
took a 69-61 decision in the Pa
vilion.
Windsor was the night's top
point-maker, stuffing in 30 count
ers. The big forward hit on 12
of 19 field goal tries and convert
ed 6 out of 8 free tosses to ac
count for his score-and-a-half of
points.
WINDSOR was tough on the
boards, too, grabbing 10 loose
balls to tie with Ledgerwood for
ball retrieving honors.
Clemetson had four fielders and
seven free throws for a total of
15 points to grab the second spot
among Card scorers. Hendry
tanked 11 markers, and Bub

Bowling eight to help the Tribe
cause.
Stanford shot a torrid 27 for
55 (.491) from the field and a less
spectacular .7:18 from the free
throw line (25x33). UCLA put
the ball through the hoop at as
nearly a good rate. .419 on 26 of
62 field goal attempts, but hit a
miserable .565 (13x23) on free
throws to help lose the game.
For the Bruins, Lawson ac
counted for 22 points on nine field
goals and four charity throws.
The UCLA flash also picked up
10 rebounds to top Bruin board
hounds.
