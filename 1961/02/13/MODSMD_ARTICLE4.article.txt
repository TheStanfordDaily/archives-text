# Drama Report: Public Asking For More Plays
## 
### MARY LOU McKINLEY SONYA MICHEL 
From a "complete lack of ar
tistic culture," the American
people are at last beginning to
appreciate theater. Jack Lem
mou told <Jele«rah> t<» the North
west Drama Conference here over
the weekend.
"It is the spread of theater
throughout the country that
counts," he continued, "not Broad
way."
ALONG these lines, John Kerr,
speaking at the Conference lunch
eon Friday, said that, as the best
theater facilities are not on Broad
way but "in the sticks." univer
sities and communities should
rise to challenge to provide good
theater and stimulated public in
terest in it.
Morever, Delmer Daves of War
ner Bros. Studios concurred with
Lemmon in saying that colleges
are a good place and perhaps the

only place for the young actor to
gain confidence and experience.
II is also the duty of the univer
sity theater to be a "leader in ex
perimentation" and encourage
new playwrights, Robert Loper,
Stanford professor of speech and
drama, said in a discussion Fri
day afternoon.
FORD Foundation playwrights
Mark Harris and Herbert Gold
and Actors Workshop director
Herbert Blau underscored this
point. Gold said that "there are
very few even half-way interest
ing playwrights in the United
States today."
And "if any place can get away
from warmed-over Broadway, it
should l)e the university theater,"
Harris added.
Glenn Hughs of the University
of Washington, stuck up for
Broadway, however, and said that
"any theater with a public fol
lowing has to limit the number of
new plays it produces." Another
panelist agreed, saying that the
playwright and the theater have
the responsibility of pleasing the
community, not themselves.
BUT, HARRIS answered, "does
a university have to have a public
following?" It is "intolerable"
that college theater should per
petuate the "myth" of Broadway,
Blau added.
Chairman Theodore Shank
pointed out that only five and one
half per cent of college produc
tions in 1951) were originals, and
therefore, colleges must, in the
future, "give the young play
wright a chance to sec his plays
presented."
"Drama people have a respon
sibility to theater literature, but
new thealers should also be equal
to new drama." he said.
CLIFFORD Foliage, technical
director at University of Cali
fornia at Davis, pointed "lit the
problem of finding new plays to
make full use of advanced tech
nical facilities.
