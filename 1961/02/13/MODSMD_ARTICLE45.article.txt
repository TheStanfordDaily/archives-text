# Rebounds Give Troy 63-57 Win Over Tribe
## 
### KEN DERY Sports Editor 
Stanford's varsity cagers stayed
with the Trojans of USC in every
thing but those all-important re
bounds and were beaten 63-57 in
the Pavilion Friday night.
Led by the great board strength
of high-scroing junior John Rudo
metkin and lightning fast forward
Verne Ashby, the Southlanders
out rebounded the Tribe, 51-34.
Rudometkin with 19 grabs and
Ashby with 15 captures cleared
the boards as often as the entire
Stanford team.
Tin: GAME was marked by
sloppy ball handling and count
less fouls, but il was closely con
tested, and for a short but ex
citing eight minutes it look like
Coach Howie Dallmar's boys had
come up with one of their inspired
performances.
But after relinquishing the lead
midway through the first half the
Indians were continually down
about seven points.
With 10 minutes remaining in
the contest, Trojan captain Ken
Stanley fouled out and the Cards
gave everything in a last ditch ef
fort.
CENTER MIKE Ledgerwood
hit a sweeping left-handed hook
and John Windsor counted on a
long jumper to close the gap to
â€¢49-44 in favor of Troy.
However USC was up to the
challenge, and a drive by guard
Chris Appel and a scoop shot by
the talented Rudometkin ran the
Trojans out of reach.
Stanford stayed close to USC in
the shooting department, hitting
at 37 per cent while the Trojans
shot at a 41 per cent clip. The
story is told in the rebounding
statistics.
Rudometkin meshed 22 points
to erase the Trojan single season
scoring record held by Danny
Rogers.
