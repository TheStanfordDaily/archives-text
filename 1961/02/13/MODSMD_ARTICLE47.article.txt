# Indian Ruggers Romp To Fifth Win by 19-0
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
The Stanford rugby team scored
16 points in the second half to
send the Cards to a 19-0 romp
over the Universities' Alumni on
the Tribe rugby field Saturday.
In a preliminary contest, the
Indian JV's scored an 11-0 win
over the San Jose Rugby Club.
Friday, the JV's pasted the Santa
Clara Broncos in a match at Santa
Clara.
KYRK REID was the Stanford
stickout. Reid socked three pen
alty kicks and two conversions to
account for 13 of the Cards' count
ers. Two of the big hooker's boots
were long ones, about 40 and 45
yards, and the other was a 30-
yarder against a stiff wind.
The first half saw both teams
engaging in tough defensive play.
Neither side could mount a scor
ing drive, although Stanford got
close at times.
The Cards had three chances to
score on penalty kicks before Reid
broke the scoring ice with his 30-
yard boot about 10 minutes before
the half, but the treacherous wind
blew them short or wide. One
time Reid kicked one to the light
of the goal, the wind appeared
to blow it right through the up
rights, and then knocked it wide.
STANFORD opened its second
half scoring splurge when Chuck
Cobb raced 30 yards and punted

down to about 10 yards in front
jof the goal whore center :: t Rick
i McMillen came up with the ball
and rushed into the end zone for
a try. Roid added the conversion
I to boost the Indians to a 8-0 mar
! gin.
| The final score of tlie day came
after Reid booted two more pen
ally kicks. Tim Hansel stopped a
University-men scoring threat by
i taking the ball and racing through
the visitors 25 yards to just short
of the midl'ield stripe where he
was forced to pass off to Reid.
Reid lumbered for ten more yards
and flipped over to Cobb, who out
footed the visitors' defense 50
yards for the try.
Reid converted, and the Cards
had breezed to their fifth win of
the season.
FOK Til 10 Universities' Alumni,
their best scoring chance came on
a 20-yard penalty kick attempt,
but it was wide, and the Univer
sityites suffered their first white
washing of the vear.
Card coach Pete K m e to vi c
praised Reid's kicking and the
J running of Hansel and Cobb.
Kmelovic also cited lock Tom Mc-
Donald and breakaway Steve Pur
sell for their work in the scrum.
The next outing for the Card
ruggers will lie against St. Mary's
on the Stanford rugby field at 3
p.m. Wednesday.
