sputnik carrying a 1.415-pound
piggy-back spaceship which was
detached on command from earth
and sent on an interplanetary
flight to Venus with a Soviet flag
in its nose.
The formal Tass News Agency
announcement was made when

the spaceship was nearly 100,000
miles from earth on a three-month
space voyage that \Vill give man
his first contact wilh the other
planets, if all goes well.
It was an unprecedented shot,
made three years ahead of a
planned U.S. planet probe and it
won cheers from Western scien
tists as a "fantastic demonstra
tion of rocketry."
(IN WASHINGTON, the White
House said President Kennedy
was informed of the shot Satur

hours ahead of Washington.)

Tass gave no details of the sput
nik carrier itself, except to say it
was "heavy" and was blasted
from earth by an "improved
stage" rocket.
There was no word on how t lie
spaceship was triggered and re
moved from the sputnik and an
gled on a course toward Venus,
tens of millions of miles away, to
plant the Soviet emblem, symbol
of world communism.
