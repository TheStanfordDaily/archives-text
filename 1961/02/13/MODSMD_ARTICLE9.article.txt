# Soviet Spaceship Bound for Venus; Russ Flag Aboard
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPIt Russia yes
terday orbited a new "heavy"
sputnik carrying a 1.415-pound
piggy-back spaceship which was
detached on command from earth
and sent on an interplanetary
flight to Venus with a Soviet flag
in its nose.
The formal Tass News Agency
announcement was made when

the spaceship was nearly 100,000
miles from earth on a three-month
space voyage that \Vill give man
his first contact wilh the other
planets, if all goes well.
It was an unprecedented shot,
made three years ahead of a
planned U.S. planet probe and it
won cheers from Western scien
tists as a "fantastic demonstra
tion of rocketry."
(IN WASHINGTON, the White
House said President Kennedy
was informed of the shot Satur
day night. Moscow time is eight
hours ahead of Washington.)

Tass gave no details of the sput
nik carrier itself, except to say it
was "heavy" and was blasted
from earth by an "improved
stage" rocket.
There was no word on how t lie
spaceship was triggered and re
moved from the sputnik and an
gled on a course toward Venus,
tens of millions of miles away, to
plant the Soviet emblem, symbol
of world communism.
IILJ<;II L. DRYDEN, deputy ad
ministrator of the National Aero
nautics and Space Administration,
said in a statement that "we have
known for some time that the
U.S.S.R. has the booster capability
to launch a mission to Venus."
He said the technique of launch
ing from a "parking orbit," —the
piggy-back method used by the
Russians — frequently has been
discussed in general scientific lit
erature.
"We will follow with interest
the progress of this experiment
and we hope that the scientific
data obtained will bo made avail
able promptly to the scientific
community." Dryden said.
ACCORDING to a "space hand
book" published in 1959 by the
House Space Committee, the most
favorable date for launching a
rocket towards Venus this year
would have been Jan. 13.
Ho w ever, according to the
handbook, the ''penalty'' for
launching after this date would
merely be a slight increase in the
launching velocity.
The minimum velocity for a
rocket on a course that would
reach Venus in 150 days would be
38,000 feet per second. According
to a table provided by the com
mittee, the velocity for a launch
30 days after the most favorable
date would still be less than 40,000
feet per second.
THE HANDBOOK said that to
reach Venus, a rocket must be
fired in a direction opposite to the
earth's motion.
It added that "if the vehicle is

launched 'backward' or against
the earth's velocity, it will assume
an independent velocity less than
that of the earth, and move on an
orbit so that it could reach the
inner planets (those closer to the
sun) Venus and Mercury."
Last March 11, the United
States launched a 94.8-pound "sun
satellite" that came within 7 mil
lion miles of the orbit of Venus.
At the time U.S. scientists empha
sized that the experiment was not

designed to reach the planet nor
to conduct a "probe" of its en
virons.
THIS SATELLITE, known as
Pioneer V, sent back radio signals
from a point 22.5 million miles
from earth.
There has been speculation for
some time that the Russians had
the rocket power to try a probe to
Venus. Their boosters are much
heavier than anything the United
States has.

handbook, the ''penalty'' for

The minimum velocity for a
rocket on a course that would
reach Venus in 150 days would be
38,000 feet per second. According
to a table provided by the com

30 days after the most favorable
date would still be less than 40,000
feet per second.
THE HANDBOOK said that to
reach Venus, a rocket must be
fired in a direction opposite to the
earth's motion.
It added that "if the vehicle is

launched 'backward' or against
the earth's velocity, it will assume
an independent velocity less than
that of the earth, and move on an
orbit so that it could reach the
inner planets (those closer to the
sun) Venus and Mercury."
Last March 11, the United

At the time U.S. scientists empha

designed to reach the planet nor
to conduct a "probe" of its en

THIS SATELLITE, known as
Pioneer V, sent back radio signals
from a point 22.5 million miles
