Savings up to $120 on automobile !
| insurance is now common for mar- j
ried men under 25 years of age
{ with the California Casualty In- j
demnity Exchange.
"Married men in this age bracket
are generally paying excessive pre- j
miums for the degree of risk in
volved," says George M. Campbell, '
Campus Representative for the Ex- J
| change.
"We believe that a married man
with family responsibilities is a !
j more careful driver, and causes j
fewer accidents," said Campbell.
"Therefore, he is entitled to rates 1
for mature drivers."
For example: A married man, age
22 with Bodily Injury Liability
$10/20,000, Property Damage
$5,000 and Medical $500 pays ,
about $157 a year with most in- |
surance companies. With Califor
j nia Casualty he would pay about
$80 less $16 dividend, or a net of
$64 (based on current 20 per cent
dividend). Thus he saves about j
$93 with the Exchange, (Other
I coverages with comparable sav
| i n 9 5 )-
Campbell declared that even un-
I married men and women with good
I driving records may save over 20 j
! per cent.
