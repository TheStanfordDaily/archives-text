Tonight, freshmen men will make the rounds of fraternilx open

houses from 7 to 9. Stanford's 24
national fraternities are hosting
at 23 houses on The Row, plus
Bowman Alumni House where
; Phi Gamma Delta will set up tem
porary headquarters. Open houses
will continue tomorrow night, as

the third annual IFC Greek Week
progresses.
ARROYO through Madera men
will visit Lower Row houses to
night, and all others go to Upper
Row. Tomorrow the situation will
be reversed, with Arroyo-Madera
going to Upper Row and others to
Lower.
By winning the two divisions of
the Chariot Race, Alpha Sig and
Theta Delt each earned 10 points
toward their candidate's winning
the title of Greek Week Queen.
Second place in each division gets
7 points, third 5 and fourth 3.
Each fraternity which entered a
chariot will receive 10 points.
THE ALPHA SIG chariot,
pulled by varsity trackmen Rich
Parker and Sheridan Downey and
carrying Alpha Sig Greek Week
Queen candidate Pat Benbough,
was timed at 18.3 seconds for the
175-yard course laid out on Cam-
pus Drive in front of Florence
Moore Hall.
Sigma Chi was second in 20 sec-
onds. with the AKL chariot third
and the Kappa Sigma entry last
of the four finalists.
THE THETA DELT creation
featured house queen candidate
I Andi Maharam reclining in a suds
filled bathtub under a blue satin
canopy. Her tub was borne on a
massive base which covered four
Theta Delts who provided loco-
motion.
The winning chariot had a dra
matic sequence in which curtains
momentarily enclosed the bath
tub and were opened to reveal
Theta Delt Chip Wright in the tub
with Miss Maharam. Her protec
tors, the chariot drivers, evicted
him and she was safe for the rest
of the race.
CLOSE BEHIND the Theta Delt
entry in novelty competition were
the Phi Sig "Flying Saucer," the
Phi Psi "Keg Roller," and the
, Beta International Harvester com
bine, each complete with queen
candidate.
Several chariots were plagued
with mechanical failures in the
prelims. The Kappa Alpha appara-
tus collapsed in mid-race, leaving,
. Lana Caffey seated on the pave
ment. A spectator standing on the
race course caused the Phi Kappa
Sigma chariot, a minature In
dianapolis car, to careen into a
group of bystanders crowding
onto the track.
Spectators messed up the finish
of the finals, too, when they
forced chariots to pull up sudden
ly just past the finish line, spill-
the AKL and Kappa Sig
queens, but doing no serious dam-
age.
