# JFK's Chickens Home to Roost
## 
### 
A "backgrounding conference" on the state of the nation's
defense situation, conducted by Secretary of Defense Robert Mc-
Namara for Defense Department reporters, has caused some em
barrassing moments for the Kennedy administration.
Mr. McNamara, in last Monday's conference, stated that a study
showed that the predicted "missile gap" had not yet developed.
This statement proved rather disconcerting to President Kennedy
in light of the President's campaign statement on August 26 that
"the missile lag looms larger and larger." No doubt the wide dis
parity between these two statements brought about the release
from Press Secretary Pierre Salinger that "No such study has been
completed. No such finding has been made in any such study.
The stories, therefore, are inaccurate." The next day Mr. Salinger
substituted "premature" for "inaccurate."
Obviously we find some differences of opinion between the
President and his chief adviser on defense matters. Mr. McNamara
evidently believes, as did Mr. Eisenhower, that the nine opera
tional Atlas missiles, along with two missile-armed Polaris subma
rines, each containing sixteen medium range ballistic missiles, are
enough to deter the Soviets. In other words there is no "destruc
tive" missile gap, although no one will argue, with a Russian
spaceship bound for Venus, that there is a power gap.
After the statements for Mr. Kennedy by Mr. Salinger it is un
clear exactly where the President does stand. We can only hope
that he will find a perch for his election chickens to come home
to roost and to begin to make responsible decisions in the vital
area of our country's defense needs.
