# Cossack Cyclers Again a Problem
## 
### 
The problem of the Cossack bicycle rider has again reached
epidemic proportions on this campus.
Part of the problem stems from the fact the University has
closed more of the campus to autos each year. This fall the area
in front of Union was added to the mall area. Part of the problem
can be traced to the rising expense of car upkeep and, thus, the
car's partial replacement by the bicycle as a means of campus
transportation.
Most of the problem, however, can be placed at the foot of
the rider himself. Generally, he is both discourteous and unre
spectful of the law. One can find proof of this in the Safety Office's
record of accidents resulting from students plummeting over the
handlebars after a guick stop or in an unwary professor knocked
down by a speeding bicycler. We do not have to look at a written
record to find proof of this situation. Anyone who has driven a car
on campus always will remember the near-miss of a bicycle which
whizzed by from out of nowhere.
Police Chief Gordon Davis has repeatedly warned bicycle riders
to obey stop signs and use hand signals. These warnings have
apparently had no effect. It is now time for Chief Davis to stop
issuing warnings and start issuing citations.
A motor officer giving citations for one week at busier inter
sections would do more than a hundred warnings to alleviate
the situation. And it might save a life.
