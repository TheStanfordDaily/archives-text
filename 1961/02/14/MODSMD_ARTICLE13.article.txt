## Kennedy Diplomats Less Distinguished 
### 
With notable exceptions the
Kennedy diplomatic appointments
have seemed 1o experienced ob
servers more conventional and
less distinguished than Ihe do
mestic appointments. There.must
he a number of interesting reasons
for this, not least among Ihem
that the field of choice has been
much narrower. Our foreign serv
ice has not yet recovered fully
from the devastation of the Mc-
Carthy era and from the sacrifices
imposed upon it and the fears en
gendered among it by the appease-

iment in the Dul
les period of the
radical e x t rem
ists of the right.
Furthermore.it
has been quite
normal and pos
sible for the lead
ing domestic ap
pointees to have
j: fruitful public
careers outside
the government

service. Rut there is not much, ex
cept to do some teaching and writ
ing and to work for a foundation,

which a man interested in foreign
affairs can do when his party is
out of power. The President has
been able to go inlo the law
schools and the departments of
government and economics to find
men with experience in public af
fairs who have enriched their
knowledge while being out of of
fice.
NEVERTHELESS, it must be
said, that there are no fat cats
selected for the big posts. There
are, however, one or more cases
of personal favoritism, there are
several cases of men chosen for
one job to get them out of a more
critical job. But we do not yet
know the full storv of the Ken
nedy diplomatic appointments.
For what is going to be done to
staff the embassies at the second
and third levels will make a very
big difference in the end.
This is especially important in
France. There is no disguising the
fact that in view of Gen. De
Gaulle's known distaste for the
company of generals, the choice
of Gen. Gavin is a strange one.
But having just read the relevant
portions of Gen. Gavin's book, I
can see why this appointment, un
promising at first glance, could
possibly turn out to have been a
good one. This is because the most
critical issue in Franco-American
affairs is to reach an understand
ing about how to modernize and
reform the largely obsolescent
strategical doctrine of NATO.
Gen. Gavin does not, I am told,
speak much French, certainly not
the kind of French which would
enable him to negotiate in Frcneh
with Gen. De Gaulle. What is
more. Gen. De Gaulle, who can be
aimiable in English, is the kind
of Frenchman, the kind of literary
Frenchman, who feels that the
truth is best stated, perhaps can
be stated only, with the precision
and the elegance of the French
language.
Nevertheless, these two gen
erals have a common language in
that both possess what is so rare
in tlie armed services, truly in
quiring and original minds. Both
are insiders in ihe military pro
fession with brilliant military ex
perience. But they are not con
ventional and conformists, and
they are not over impressed by
the big brass. It is not impossible
that between them they may work
out for NATO that new military
doctrine which it so sorely needs.
BUT IF GEN. Gavin is to do

what he is especially qualified to
do in Paris, the Embassy will
have 1o be greatly strengthened to
handle oilier business.
Preeminent among the notably
good appointments are those of
Mr. David Bruce to London and
Mr. George Kennon to Belgrade.
Mr. Bruce has been Ambassador
to France, 1o Germany, and to the
Goal and Steel Community, and
ihere is no other American with a
comparable knowledge of the cru
cial problem of Europe. That
problems is iho schism of Western
Europe between the Inner Six and
the Outer Seven. The closing of
that schism is a primary Ameri
can interest in Europe, fully as
important as, perhaps even more
important than, the rejuvenation I
of NATO.
The return of George Kennon
brings back into government serv
ice a most perceptive. learned, and
distinguished mind. It was a bril
liant idea in the State Department
to send Mr. Kennon to Yugo
slavia. For there is no better
place, not even in Moscow itself,
to observe what is so very impor
tant and so little known the for
eign policy of Iho Soviet Union
within the Communist orbit, with
China of course, but also with the
smaller Communist states.
THE C HOIC E of Kenneth Gal
braith for India is excellent, pro
vided he can be spared in Wash
ington. And so too, it seems to
men, is the choice of Ellsworth

Rnnker for Brazil. In Italy and in
India, where he has served, he has
been extremely successful in his
c] u ie t, old-fashioned, American
way.
Then, very high marks are de
served for the choice of Prof. Roi
schauer for Japan. For with his
knowledge not only of the Japa
nese language but of Japanese his
tory and culture, he should be
able to make a kind of contact

| with the Japanese which has not
been achieved by any of his prede
cessors.
'The decision to keep Llewellyn
Thompson in Moscow and Walter
Dow ling in Bonn is, in view of all
that is pending, a wise one. Wo
have no more competent diplomat
I ban Thompson, none more expert
in the art. of quiet diplomacy
which the President and Secretary
Rusk believe in.

With notable exceptions the
Kennedy diplomatic appointments
have seemed 1o experienced ob
servers more conventional and
less distinguished than Ihe do
mestic appointments. There.must
he a number of interesting reasons
for this, not least among Ihem
that the field of choice has been
much narrower. Our foreign serv
ice has not yet recovered fully
from the devastation of the Mc-
Carthy era and from the sacrifices
imposed upon it and the fears en
gendered among it by the appease-

iment in the Dul
les period of the
radical e x t rem
ists of the right.
Furthermore.it
has been quite
normal and pos
sible for the lead
ing domestic ap
pointees to have
j: fruitful public
careers outside
the government

service. Rut there is not much, ex
cept to do some teaching and writ
ing and to work for a foundation,

which a man interested in foreign
affairs can do when his party is
out of power. The President has
been able to go inlo the law
schools and the departments of
government and economics to find
men with experience in public af
fairs who have enriched their
knowledge while being out of of
fice.
NEVERTHELESS, it must be
said, that there are no fat cats
selected for the big posts. There
are, however, one or more cases
of personal favoritism, there are
several cases of men chosen for
one job to get them out of a more
critical job. But we do not yet
know the full storv of the Ken
nedy diplomatic appointments.
For what is going to be done to
staff the embassies at the second
and third levels will make a very
big difference in the end.
This is especially important in
France. There is no disguising the
fact that in view of Gen. De
Gaulle's known distaste for the
company of generals, the choice
of Gen. Gavin is a strange one.
But having just read the relevant
portions of Gen. Gavin's book, I
can see why this appointment, un
promising at first glance, could
possibly turn out to have been a
good one. This is because the most
critical issue in Franco-American
affairs is to reach an understand
ing about how to modernize and
reform the largely obsolescent
strategical doctrine of NATO.
Gen. Gavin does not, I am told,
speak much French, certainly not
the kind of French which would
enable him to negotiate in Frcneh
with Gen. De Gaulle. What is
more. Gen. De Gaulle, who can be
aimiable in English, is the kind
of Frenchman, the kind of literary
Frenchman, who feels that the
truth is best stated, perhaps can
be stated only, with the precision
and the elegance of the French
language.
Nevertheless, these two gen
erals have a common language in
that both possess what is so rare
in tlie armed services, truly in
quiring and original minds. Both
are insiders in ihe military pro
fession with brilliant military ex
perience. But they are not con
ventional and conformists, and
they are not over impressed by
the big brass. It is not impossible
that between them they may work
out for NATO that new military
doctrine which it so sorely needs.
BUT IF GEN. Gavin is to do

what he is especially qualified to
do in Paris, the Embassy will
have 1o be greatly strengthened to
handle oilier business.
Preeminent among the notably
good appointments are those of
Mr. David Bruce to London and
Mr. George Kennon to Belgrade.
Mr. Bruce has been Ambassador
to France, 1o Germany, and to the
Goal and Steel Community, and
ihere is no other American with a
comparable knowledge of the cru
cial problem of Europe. That
problems is iho schism of Western
Europe between the Inner Six and
the Outer Seven. The closing of
that schism is a primary Ameri
can interest in Europe, fully as
important as, perhaps even more
important than, the rejuvenation I
of NATO.

speak much French, certainly not
the kind of French which would
enable him to negotiate in Frcneh
with Gen. De Gaulle. What is
more. Gen. De Gaulle, who can be
aimiable in English, is the kind
of Frenchman, the kind of literary
Frenchman, who feels that the
truth is best stated, perhaps can
be stated only, with the precision
and the elegance of the French
language.
Nevertheless, these two gen
erals have a common language in
that both possess what is so rare
in tlie armed services, truly in
quiring and original minds. Both
are insiders in ihe military pro
fession with brilliant military ex
perience. But they are not con
ventional and conformists, and
they are not over impressed by
the big brass. It is not impossible
that between them they may work
out for NATO that new military
doctrine which it so sorely needs.
BUT IF GEN. Gavin is to do

what he is especially qualified to
do in Paris, the Embassy will
have 1o be greatly strengthened to
handle oilier business.
Preeminent among the notably
good appointments are those of
Mr. David Bruce to London and
Mr. George Kennon to Belgrade.
Mr. Bruce has been Ambassador
to France, 1o Germany, and to the
Goal and Steel Community, and
ihere is no other American with a
comparable knowledge of the cru
cial problem of Europe. That
problems is iho schism of Western
Europe between the Inner Six and
the Outer Seven. The closing of
that schism is a primary Ameri
can interest in Europe, fully as
important as, perhaps even more
important than, the rejuvenation I
of NATO.
The return of George Kennon
brings back into government serv
ice a most perceptive. learned, and
distinguished mind. It was a bril
liant idea in the State Department
to send Mr. Kennon to Yugo
slavia. For there is no better
place, not even in Moscow itself,
to observe what is so very impor
tant and so little known the for
eign policy of Iho Soviet Union
within the Communist orbit, with
China of course, but also with the
smaller Communist states.
THE C HOIC E of Kenneth Gal
braith for India is excellent, pro
vided he can be spared in Wash
ington. And so too, it seems to
men, is the choice of Ellsworth

Rnnker for Brazil. In Italy and in
India, where he has served, he has
been extremely successful in his
c] u ie t, old-fashioned, American
way.
Then, very high marks are de
served for the choice of Prof. Roi
schauer for Japan. For with his
knowledge not only of the Japa
nese language but of Japanese his
tory and culture, he should be
able to make a kind of contact

| with the Japanese which has not
been achieved by any of his prede
cessors.
'The decision to keep Llewellyn
Thompson in Moscow and Walter
Dow ling in Bonn is, in view of all
that is pending, a wise one. Wo
have no more competent diplomat
I ban Thompson, none more expert
in the art. of quiet diplomacy
which the President and Secretary

With notable exceptions the
Kennedy diplomatic appointments
have seemed 1o experienced ob
servers more conventional and
less distinguished than Ihe do
mestic appointments. There.must
he a number of interesting reasons
for this, not least among Ihem
that the field of choice has been
much narrower. Our foreign serv
ice has not yet recovered fully
from the devastation of the Mc-
Carthy era and from the sacrifices
imposed upon it and the fears en
gendered among it by the appease-

iment in the Dul
les period of the
radical e x t rem
ists of the right.
Furthermore.it
has been quite
normal and pos
sible for the lead

pointees to have
j: fruitful public
careers outside
the government

service. Rut there is not much, ex
cept to do some teaching and writ
ing and to work for a foundation,

which a man interested in foreign
affairs can do when his party is
out of power. The President has
been able to go inlo the law
schools and the departments of
government and economics to find
men with experience in public af
fairs who have enriched their
knowledge while being out of of
fice.
NEVERTHELESS, it must be
said, that there are no fat cats
selected for the big posts. There
are, however, one or more cases
of personal favoritism, there are
several cases of men chosen for
one job to get them out of a more
critical job. But we do not yet
know the full storv of the Ken
nedy diplomatic appointments.
For what is going to be done to
staff the embassies at the second
and third levels will make a very
big difference in the end.
This is especially important in
France. There is no disguising the
fact that in view of Gen. De
Gaulle's known distaste for the
company of generals, the choice
of Gen. Gavin is a strange one.
But having just read the relevant
portions of Gen. Gavin's book, I
can see why this appointment, un
promising at first glance, could
possibly turn out to have been a
good one. This is because the most
critical issue in Franco-American
affairs is to reach an understand
ing about how to modernize and
reform the largely obsolescent
strategical doctrine of NATO.
