## New Prints At Gallery Reviewed 
### 
Whether prints are merely de
signs, or can be as significant as
paintings is one of the problems
of contemporary art. The 100
Dutch prints currently showing at
the Art Gallery purport to answer
this question affirmatively.
Some of the woodcuts, intaglios,
and lithographs succeed in their
challenge. Others, for reasons of
composition, technique, and sub
ject matter, find more merit as
designs. Still others, striving as
compositions, fail on both counts.
ANOTHER GROUP, metal re
liefs, would seem happier as gen
uine sculpture. In short, the mar-

riages of print
ing media to va
rious purposes
are not always
happy ones.
Two of Ru
dolph Rossem's
color lithographs
fit the first clas
sification. They
are abstracts
well-composed to
fit a rectangular

picture frame, and not to ho j
stamped willy-nilly on sheets of
paper. In "The Bird Market,"
color, rather than line, integrates
the design elements. "The Mira
cle" is cohesive enough to be an
abstract composition, but a third
print of Rossem's, "Taurus," lacks
this quality and stands best as an
abstract design.
Piet Stuyvenberg's abstract con
fusions have a stamped-on look.
They fail to fill their rectangular
borders, and hang uncomfortably
in a void of white background.
Nor are they outstanding as de
signs; the lines are disjoint, the
color heavy.
The metal reliefs of A. C. J.
Livinus have a powerful sculp
tural quality. As designs, the
dark, simple figures make a strik
ing contrast with their white
backgrounds. But their three- di
mensionalism would he even more
•striking in sculpture.
OTHERS in the group are excel
lent as pure designs. Jeanne Gos
ling's linocuts are classical, richly
colored. Hans Post ma's intaglios
show good use of line and color
in Batik-like patterns. None of
these stylized works, however,
could stand as a composition.
Carel Visser's woodcuts bear a
superficial resemblance to Mon
driaan's paintings. But where
Mondriaan disciplined and puri
fied his lines into precise, rectang
ular compositions, Visser is con
tent to imprint his simple designs
in Ihc midst of white back
grounds. Thus his designs have
none of the depth Mondriaan
achieved in two dimensions.
KUNO BRINKS is an artist in
this tradition. His intaglios "Fri
sian Stallions," "Oxen," and "Por-1
trait of Jan Sluyters." are objec
tive and highly-detailed. A. J.
Veldhoen is another artist pri
marily interested in the textures
produced by his lines.
In the same trend, but using
bolder lines and less detail, is
Johan Dijkstra. There is sharp
contrast in his "Artists' Cafe"
and"The Old Loiters." In "Burial
Repast," he uses finer lines and
subtler contrast to produce a mel
ancholy effect.
"The new prints," Martinet
states, "have earned a place on
the walls of modern interiors."
This statement must be clarified.
The prints, in most cases, have |
merit as classical or abstract de- j
signs. But even in their own '
terms, they hardly reach the
standards set for compositions by
Mondriaan. Van Gogh, and other !
outstanding figures in the Dutch

the Art Gallery purport to answer
this question affirmatively.
Some of the woodcuts, intaglios,
and lithographs succeed in their
challenge. Others, for reasons of
composition, technique, and sub
ject matter, find more merit as
designs. Still others, striving as
compositions, fail on both counts.
ANOTHER GROUP, metal re
liefs, would seem happier as gen
uine sculpture. In short, the mar-

riages of print
ing media to va
rious purposes
are not always
happy ones.
Two of Ru
dolph Rossem's
color lithographs
fit the first clas
sification. They
are abstracts
well-composed to
fit a rectangular

picture frame, and not to ho j
stamped willy-nilly on sheets of
paper. In "The Bird Market,"
color, rather than line, integrates
the design elements. "The Mira
cle" is cohesive enough to be an
abstract composition, but a third
print of Rossem's, "Taurus," lacks
this quality and stands best as an
abstract design.
Piet Stuyvenberg's abstract con
fusions have a stamped-on look.
They fail to fill their rectangular
borders, and hang uncomfortably
in a void of white background.
Nor are they outstanding as de
signs; the lines are disjoint, the
color heavy.
The metal reliefs of A. C. J.
Livinus have a powerful sculp
tural quality. As designs, the
dark, simple figures make a strik
ing contrast with their white
backgrounds. But their three- di
mensionalism would he even more
•striking in sculpture.
OTHERS in the group are excel
lent as pure designs. Jeanne Gos
ling's linocuts are classical, richly
colored. Hans Post ma's intaglios
show good use of line and color
in Batik-like patterns. None of
these stylized works, however,
could stand as a composition.
Carel Visser's woodcuts bear a
superficial resemblance to Mon
driaan's paintings. But where
Mondriaan disciplined and puri
fied his lines into precise, rectang
ular compositions, Visser is con
tent to imprint his simple designs
in Ihc midst of white back
grounds. Thus his designs have
none of the depth Mondriaan
achieved in two dimensions.
KUNO BRINKS is an artist in
this tradition. His intaglios "Fri
sian Stallions," "Oxen," and "Por-1
trait of Jan Sluyters." are objec
tive and highly-detailed. A. J.
Veldhoen is another artist pri
marily interested in the textures
produced by his lines.
In the same trend, but using
bolder lines and less detail, is
Johan Dijkstra. There is sharp
contrast in his "Artists' Cafe"
and"The Old Loiters." In "Burial
Repast," he uses finer lines and
subtler contrast to produce a mel
ancholy effect.
"The new prints," Martinet
states, "have earned a place on
the walls of modern interiors."
This statement must be clarified.
The prints, in most cases, have |
merit as classical or abstract de- j
signs. But even in their own '
terms, they hardly reach the
standards set for compositions by
Mondriaan. Van Gogh, and other !
outstanding figures in the Dutch
