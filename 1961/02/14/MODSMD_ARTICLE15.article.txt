### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
At almost every breakfast the Stanford sports fans opens to page
three and drinks in, along with the morning coffee, the latest in foot
ball, basketball, track and baseball. Yet invariably he fails to realize
that he is missing most of the extremely interesting happenings in
other, less-publicized sports around the Bay Area.
KOMK OF the most prominent national sporting media devote
much of their energies to the more exotic pastimes croquet, left
handed ping pong, truffle hunting and others, molding their sub
scribers into well-rounded, sophisticated people. The Stanford fan, on
the other hand, is in a rut, he knows nothing about the more refined
pastimes.
This has been our fault as much as the readers' and so, today, in

this space, we will attempt to rec
tify the oversight by presenting
an account of one of the Penin
sula's most important sporting
events, the Menlo-llillsborough
Dog Show.
Hey, wait — don't go away!
That's what we thought too —
that a dog show would he about
the last thing we'd want to attend
or even read about, but this got to
be very interesting after we really
took a look around.
VVK'D NKYKR actually been to
a dog show — you know, just
the usual biggest dog, longest
tail and muttiest mutt type thing
put on by the firemen back home.
But this was different. Here it
was ieal competition, with none
but Die best dogs entered.
As we said, wo didn't know
much about the whole deal and
so we started with the usual safo.

first step — we wrote to the chairman of the Menlo-Hillsborough af
fair for free tickets. The chairman turned out to he a Mr. Holden and
he must have been sympathetic with our big "educate-the-reader
campaign" because right away, here came the free passes. Ho really
went all out too. for they were officials' tickets and entitled us to in
spect the proceedings first hand.
THIS is A BIG society gathering besides being a sports affair
like tho first home Stanford football game when all the rooters' white
shirts haven't been worn five times already. Since Mr. Holden had
gone all out for us, we figured that all we could do was reciprocate,
and so we went all out too, by dressing in our tan windbreaker and
khakis.
v.
Putting on the Dog
Good thing we did too. because most of the other folks had i-eally
put on the dog; in fact it looked like there was more fur on the audi
ence than on the mutts — sorry, participants.
Maybe you're thinking, "Why doesn't he just tell us what hap
pened and who won and let us drink our coffee?" But that's the
trouble — it's hard to tell if anything is going on at a dog show and
besides half of ihe fun. at least, is just the feeling that we're getting
well-rounded, like we spoke of earlier.
FINALLY, AFTER mingling with the crowd and getting sophis
ticated. we decided it was time to see some real action and so we
looked up Mr. Holden.
Mr. Holden — he was a regular sport and so we decided to call
him Joe (Joe being his first name) obliged again: "Come around
with the judges and mVself and you'll see how we pick the winner."
The whole procession of us started slowly around the hall, stop
ping to inspect each dog. Each judge examined, poked and prodded
and marked down a score.
WE WERE REALLY surprised. None of the dogs barked, fought
or bit the judges. It was nothing like the hometown firemens' con
tests. Here it was entirely one-sided, none of the dogs fought back.
When we went to Stanford football games we could at least count
on an occasional water balloon being thrown, and we were beginning
to get a little bored here, even with the well-roundedness thrown in.
But wo hadn't counted on Mrs. Von Russe.
The Winner: Warf 111
The judges had just awarded best-in-class for poodles to the Black
wells' entry, Warf 111, and gave Mrs. Von Russe's dog second prize
when suddenly Mrs. Von Russe rushed up, and without warning,
struck Mr. Holden over the head with her imported walking stick.
"NO UNf LIPPED MONGREL can beat my dog," Mrs. Von Russe
screamed and with that she hit him again, a solid blow to the lapel.
Mr. Holden was taken by surprise. Mrs. Von Russe struck again,
scoring a glancing hit on the shoulder, but Joe recovered and struck
right back, giving Mrs. Von Russe a sharp whap across the shins
with his judge's pointer.
Here was Ihe action we'd been waiting for. Real hand-to-hand,
give-no-quarter combat. The fight spread; the Blackwells ran to tho
aid of Mr. Holden. The dogs began barking; they even bit some of the
judges.
I NFORTUNATELY WE HAD to leave in order to got back to our
late-afternoon human relations lab and so we bid a hasty farewell to
Joe and left. Before we left though, we made sure that we got more
free tickets for next year's show, ringside tickets, and wondered how
we could have gone so long without experiencing the excitement of
ono of the best of sports.

sula's most important sporting
events, the Menlo-llillsborough
Dog Show.
Hey, wait — don't go away!
That's what we thought too —
that a dog show would he about
the last thing we'd want to attend
or even read about, but this got to
be very interesting after we really
took a look around.
VVK'D NKYKR actually been to
a dog show — you know, just
the usual biggest dog, longest
tail and muttiest mutt type thing
put on by the firemen back home.
But this was different. Here it
was ieal competition, with none
but Die best dogs entered.
As we said, wo didn't know
much about the whole deal and
so we started with the usual safo.

first step — we wrote to the chairman of the Menlo-Hillsborough af
fair for free tickets. The chairman turned out to he a Mr. Holden and
he must have been sympathetic with our big "educate-the-reader
campaign" because right away, here came the free passes. Ho really
went all out too. for they were officials' tickets and entitled us to in
spect the proceedings first hand.
THIS is A BIG society gathering besides being a sports affair
like tho first home Stanford football game when all the rooters' white
shirts haven't been worn five times already. Since Mr. Holden had
gone all out for us, we figured that all we could do was reciprocate,
and so we went all out too, by dressing in our tan windbreaker and
khakis.
v.
Putting on the Dog
Good thing we did too. because most of the other folks had i-eally
put on the dog; in fact it looked like there was more fur on the audi
ence than on the mutts — sorry, participants.
Maybe you're thinking, "Why doesn't he just tell us what hap
pened and who won and let us drink our coffee?" But that's the
trouble — it's hard to tell if anything is going on at a dog show and
besides half of ihe fun. at least, is just the feeling that we're getting
well-rounded, like we spoke of earlier.
FINALLY, AFTER mingling with the crowd and getting sophis
ticated. we decided it was time to see some real action and so we
looked up Mr. Holden.
Mr. Holden — he was a regular sport and so we decided to call
him Joe (Joe being his first name) obliged again: "Come around
with the judges and mVself and you'll see how we pick the winner."
The whole procession of us started slowly around the hall, stop
ping to inspect each dog. Each judge examined, poked and prodded
and marked down a score.
WE WERE REALLY surprised. None of the dogs barked, fought
or bit the judges. It was nothing like the hometown firemens' con
tests. Here it was entirely one-sided, none of the dogs fought back.
When we went to Stanford football games we could at least count
on an occasional water balloon being thrown, and we were beginning
to get a little bored here, even with the well-roundedness thrown in.
But wo hadn't counted on Mrs. Von Russe.
The Winner: Warf 111
The judges had just awarded best-in-class for poodles to the Black
wells' entry, Warf 111, and gave Mrs. Von Russe's dog second prize
when suddenly Mrs. Von Russe rushed up, and without warning,
struck Mr. Holden over the head with her imported walking stick.
"NO UNf LIPPED MONGREL can beat my dog," Mrs. Von Russe
screamed and with that she hit him again, a solid blow to the lapel.
Mr. Holden was taken by surprise. Mrs. Von Russe struck again,
scoring a glancing hit on the shoulder, but Joe recovered and struck
right back, giving Mrs. Von Russe a sharp whap across the shins
with his judge's pointer.
Here was Ihe action we'd been waiting for. Real hand-to-hand,
give-no-quarter combat. The fight spread; the Blackwells ran to tho
aid of Mr. Holden. The dogs began barking; they even bit some of the
judges.
I NFORTUNATELY WE HAD to leave in order to got back to our
late-afternoon human relations lab and so we bid a hasty farewell to
Joe and left. Before we left though, we made sure that we got more
free tickets for next year's show, ringside tickets, and wondered how
we could have gone so long without experiencing the excitement of
ono of the best of sports.

first step — we wrote to the chairman of the Menlo-Hillsborough af
fair for free tickets. The chairman turned out to he a Mr. Holden and
he must have been sympathetic with our big "educate-the-reader
campaign" because right away, here came the free passes. Ho really
went all out too. for they were officials' tickets and entitled us to in
spect the proceedings first hand.
THIS is A BIG society gathering besides being a sports affair
like tho first home Stanford football game when all the rooters' white
shirts haven't been worn five times already. Since Mr. Holden had
gone all out for us, we figured that all we could do was reciprocate,
and so we went all out too, by dressing in our tan windbreaker and
khakis.
v.
Putting on the Dog
Good thing we did too. because most of the other folks had i-eally
put on the dog; in fact it looked like there was more fur on the audi
ence than on the mutts — sorry, participants.
Maybe you're thinking, "Why doesn't he just tell us what hap
pened and who won and let us drink our coffee?" But that's the
trouble — it's hard to tell if anything is going on at a dog show and
besides half of ihe fun. at least, is just the feeling that we're getting
well-rounded, like we spoke of earlier.
FINALLY, AFTER mingling with the crowd and getting sophis
ticated. we decided it was time to see some real action and so we
looked up Mr. Holden.
Mr. Holden — he was a regular sport and so we decided to call
him Joe (Joe being his first name) obliged again: "Come around
with the judges and mVself and you'll see how we pick the winner."
The whole procession of us started slowly around the hall, stop
ping to inspect each dog. Each judge examined, poked and prodded
and marked down a score.
WE WERE REALLY surprised. None of the dogs barked, fought
or bit the judges. It was nothing like the hometown firemens' con
tests. Here it was entirely one-sided, none of the dogs fought back.
When we went to Stanford football games we could at least count
on an occasional water balloon being thrown, and we were beginning
to get a little bored here, even with the well-roundedness thrown in.
But wo hadn't counted on Mrs. Von Russe.
The Winner: Warf 111
The judges had just awarded best-in-class for poodles to the Black
wells' entry, Warf 111, and gave Mrs. Von Russe's dog second prize
when suddenly Mrs. Von Russe rushed up, and without warning,
struck Mr. Holden over the head with her imported walking stick.
"NO UNf LIPPED MONGREL can beat my dog," Mrs. Von Russe
screamed and with that she hit him again, a solid blow to the lapel.
Mr. Holden was taken by surprise. Mrs. Von Russe struck again,
scoring a glancing hit on the shoulder, but Joe recovered and struck
right back, giving Mrs. Von Russe a sharp whap across the shins
with his judge's pointer.
Here was Ihe action we'd been waiting for. Real hand-to-hand,
give-no-quarter combat. The fight spread; the Blackwells ran to tho
aid of Mr. Holden. The dogs began barking; they even bit some of the
judges.
I NFORTUNATELY WE HAD to leave in order to got back to our
late-afternoon human relations lab and so we bid a hasty farewell to
Joe and left. Before we left though, we made sure that we got more
free tickets for next year's show, ringside tickets, and wondered how
we could have gone so long without experiencing the excitement of
ono of the best of sports.


WARF 111
Best in Class
At almost every breakfast the Stanford sports fans opens to page
three and drinks in, along with the morning coffee, the latest in foot
ball, basketball, track and baseball. Yet invariably he fails to realize
that he is missing most of the extremely interesting happenings in
other, less-publicized sports around the Bay Area.
KOMK OF the most prominent national sporting media devote
much of their energies to the more exotic pastimes croquet, left
handed ping pong, truffle hunting and others, molding their sub
scribers into well-rounded, sophisticated people. The Stanford fan, on
the other hand, is in a rut, he knows nothing about the more refined
pastimes.

Dog Show.
Hey, wait — don't go away!

that a dog show would he about
the last thing we'd want to attend

be very interesting after we really
took a look around.

a dog show — you know, just
the usual biggest dog, longest

put on by the firemen back home.
But this was different. Here it
was ieal competition, with none
