# Frosh Win Two Games

### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford's talented Papoose
hoopsters ran their season's rec
ord to 10-2 with a pair of easy vic
tories over San Jose State, 69-38,
and Santa Rosa Junior College,
77-59, last weekend.
The Indians avenged one of
their two season's losses Friday
night. The Spartans had defeated
Stanford 55-44 earlier this season,
but Stanford demonstrated its su
periority by its 69-38 romp.
TOM DOSE, Stanford's 6-7'L>
center led the attack with 14
points and 10 rebounds. He and
Dick Leewenburg shackled big
Harry Edwards, San Jose's high
scoring 6-8 center, with 11 points
and kept him away from the
boards.
Stanford shot 41 per cent from
tho floor and made 81 per cent
on free throws, aside from bat
tling the taller San Jo.seans even
in rebounds.
SATURDAY tho Papooses had
a much tougher time with the
somewhat less talented Santa
Rosans. They had to overcome an
early 9-5 Rose lead to grab a pre
carious 35-32 halftime lead.
Stanford broke away in the sec
ond half quickly to run up a 51-37
lead, at which point the reserves
took over and widened the gap
to the eventual 77-59.
It was Dose, omnipresent under
the basket whenever a loose ball
appeared to need putting into the
nets, who broke Santa Rosa's
back. Dose scored 26 points on
nine field 1 - goals and eight free
throws while 18 re
bounds.
