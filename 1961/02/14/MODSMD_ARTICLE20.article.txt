### JOCK McBAINE 
As the winter intramural sports
program reaches its peak, Direc
tor Elwyn Bugge predicts lhat
the total number of participants
for the year will exceed 4,000.
Bugge, having guided some fif
teen-hundred graduates and un
dergraduates through the fall pro
gram, is now engaged in running
basketball, bowling and ping
pong tournaments as well as pre
paring for the wrestling competi
tion later this month.
LAST quarter, important victor
ies were earned by Phi Kappa
Sigma in football, Theta Chi in
volleyball, and Delta Upsilon in
gymnastics. As the winter pro
gram opened, Rinconada led all
freshman teams with 94 points;
El Campo championed the eating
clubs with 71 and Delta Upsilon
led the total competition with 152
points.
Bugge currently has 100 teams
playing in the basketball tourna
ment. The tournament is divided
into an A league and a B league
with further divisions in each
league. All division winners will
compete in the final rounds for
the championship won last year
by Sigma Chi. Last year's overall
intramural champions, Sigma Chi,
are favored to repeat as basket
ball winners. Others with good
showings in the early rounds are
Kappa Sigma Alpha and Otero.
TilK PIXG-PONG tournament
has reached the round of 16 and
will be completed later this
month. Entries for Ihe wrestling
competition, in which Phi Delta
Theta has already placed 19 en
tries, will close on Feb. 20. Gary
Lofgren, a freshman last year
and now a member of Beta Theta
Pi. will defend his heavyweight
title.
Bugge looks forward to the
completion of tnis quarter's pro
gram. The cumulative scores of
the front runners will be some
indication as to the final results
in June. The big spring program
will probably decide the Univer-

sity championship; it will also to use the University's fine ath
give still more students a chance letics facilities.
