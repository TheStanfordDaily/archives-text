## 
### 
The Stanford winery one ol the Peninsulas
oldest landmarks soon will be converted to house
a bank, an international restaurant and other ten
ants. the University has announced.
Little known to Stanford students, the winery
rests incongruously in a stretch of open field be
tween two gas stations and the modern Stanford-
Pa lo Alto Medical Center near the Stanford Shop
ping Center.
I'KI SDNTIA , the large, rambling, barn-like
structure is being used as an animal breeders' serv- 1
ice facility.
Plans for lite project have been approved by
ihe University, and were okayed by the Palo Alto
Planning Commission and City Council last month.
A SAN FIiAM IS( O architect lire firm will 1
lease the building and four acres around it at the
intersection of Quarry and Welch Roads.
The winery's exterior and planting will remain
about the same, but the interior will be completely
rebuilt in conformity with Palo Alto building codes.
ITS .AIAN'\ broken windows are boarded up.
the outside stone is pock-marked in many places
and weeds grow close around it,
It is not known exactly when Senator Stanford
built the winery after he acquired the property in
IHTti. Although well-equipped, it was not licensed
for commercial, wine production but was used to
proce s :.i apes from the \ineyards on liis Palo
Alto Stock farm now the Stanford campus.
Till, WIN! K\ w.i there \vlu-:i the first stu '

dents enrolled in 1891, and n survived the great
earthquake of 1906 which badly damaged the
rest of the campus unscratched.
It apparently was used in the following years
successively for storage, as a dairy and most re
cently by the breeders.
Till-; "NKW" will find the Wells
Fargo-American Trust Co. on the ground floor of
the main section.
A harmonizing one-story addition will be built
al the north end and back along the single-story
real' wing. The wing and the addition will contain
kitchens and serving areas for about 10 restaura
teurs jointly offering an international cuisine.
RESTAURANT seating for several hundred
people is contemplated, both indoors and in Ihe
winery's courtyard. Facilities for art exhibitions
also are planned.
Another tenant, possibly a brokerage firm, will
occupy the other single-stor> wing which juts to
Ihe road on the oilier end of the main building.
Several other tenants will occupy the main build
ing's second floor.
Space for more than 20(1 cars will be provided
in landscaped parking areas.
