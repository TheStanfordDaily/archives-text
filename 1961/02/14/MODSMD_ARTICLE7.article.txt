# Soviets: ‘Probe May Hit Venus’
## 
### UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
II is too early yet to tell whether
the Soviet rocket speeding towards
the fog-shrouded planet of Venus
will land on her or merely estab
lish an orbit about her, said a
Russian official yesterday.
He pointed out that either of
the two fates is a possibility for
the piggyback "interplanetary sta
tion" when it reaches its objective
some three months from now.
Moscow Planetarium Director
Victor Bazykiu was unwilling to
commit himself as to which is the
more likely.
OTIIMK scientists said the
rocket, carrying a Soviet flag in
its nose and traveling at 25,000
miles an hour, is the first of
many interplanetary communica
tions stations to bo scattered
around space.
The official Tass News Agency
said tonight the Venus rocket "is
continuing its flight along the pre
determined path." Moscow Ra
dio's home service said the ap
paratus inside the rocket is work
ing normally as il approaches a
point 300,000 miles from earth.
IN LONDON, Sir Bernard
Lovell, director of Britain's Jodrell
Banks Observatory, said "The pos
sibilites open to Russia in space
now are almost limitless."
Prof. Vladimir Dobronravov.
quoted by the Tass News Agency,
said the spectacular Venus shot
"had laid the beginning for the
systematic application of a new
method in space exploration.
"THIS NIOW method." lie said,
"is ihe use of automatic inter
planetary stations, fitted out with
radio telemetrie systems for com
municating with the home planet
and playing back the results of
space observations."
