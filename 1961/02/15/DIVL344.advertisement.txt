NEW AUTO INSURANCE
SAVINGS ANNOUNCED
Savings up to $120 on automobile
i insurance is now common for mar- |
ried men under 25 years of age 5
with the California Casualty ln
demnity Exchange.
"Married men in this age bracket
are generally paying excessive pre
miums for the degree of risk in
! volved," says George M. Campbell, I
Campus Representative for the Ex
j change.
"We believe that a married man
with family responsibilities is a
more careful driver, and causss
fewer accidents," said Campbell,
i "Therefore, he is entitled to rates
1 for mature drivers."
For example: A married man, age
22 with Bodily Injury Liability
$10/20,000, Property Damage
$5,000 and Medical $500 pays
about $157 a year with most in
surance companies. With Califor
nia Casualty he would pay about
$80 less $16 dividend, or a net of
$64 (based on current 20 per cent
dividend). Thus he saves about
$93 with the Exchange. (Other
coverages with comparable sav
-1 ings).
j Campbell declared that even un
married men and women with good
driving records may save over 20
per cent.
