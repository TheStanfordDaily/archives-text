dent Gamal Abdel Nasser of the
United Arab Republic has granted
full recognition to the pro-Lu
mumba regime in the Congolese
city of Stanleyville. The Stanley
ville regime is headed by Antoinc
Gizenga, former Vice-Premier in
the former Lumumba govern
ment.
In Leopoldville, Lumumba's
widow marched bare - breasted
through the streets of the Congo
lese capital to show her mourning
for her husband.
Marching with Pauline Lumum
ba were some 100 followers of the
late Premier- the women also
baring their breasts and the men
bowing their heads.
Carrying two white flags, the
mourners marched from the Lu
mumba residence through crowds
lining the streets of the African
section to U.N. headquarters.
Unconfirmed reports reaching
Leopoldville late last night said
two Belgians were shot in the
first reprisals for the death of ex-
Premier Patrice Lumumba.
The reports, which could not be
confirmed by U.N. officials here,
said the Belgians were accosted
in a Luluabourg cafe by Lumum
ba supporters.
They were asked what they
thought of the killing and were
shot when they failed to reply,
the reports said.
