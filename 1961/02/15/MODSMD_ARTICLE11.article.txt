## 
### MARCIA LOER 
Coinniont on the article "The Pressures on Col
lege Girls Today" by Dr. Carl Binger which was
printed in the Daily last week has aroused wide
spread and varied comment among students and
faculty.
Remarks on the article range from "amusing"
and "noi worth reading" to "excellent" and "true
for Stanford in every detail."
IT WAS AN " accurate, insightful and sensitive
discussion of the problem," according to Dr. John
Black, director of the Counseling and Testing Cen
ter. On the subject of depression among college
women he said, "the article points to a real prob
lem. Because it's not as severe or the same for
everyone doesn't mean that it's not a problem."
Dr. Eleanor Maccoby of the Psychology Depart
ment agreed with Dr. Binger that men are an ex
ceedingly important bulwark for a girl's self
esteem but pointed out thai with the lengthening
life span girls now can have time for a career as
well as a home and family.
Miss Elva Brown, Dean of Women, also spoke
along these lines. It is no longer a matter of being
a wife and mother or a career women but rather
a matter of assuming multiple roles. "A woman
has to think in long terms to think ahead when
her children are grown and her time will be free."
IN COMMENTING on Dr. Ringer's statement
that to women graduate school often means only a
further opportunity to meet men. Dr. Lois Sloltz.
Professor Emeritus of the Psychology Department,
brought out that women who wan) to go on have
an obligation to consider the ethics involved in ac-

cepting a fellowship.
On women's use of an education she pointed out
that "we have 1 educated more and more women in
the last hundred years but at the present lime we
are only beginning to extend their role so they can
use their education."
Student comment on tho article was consider
ably varied. It was "amazing how close these
things hil home" according In Ruble President Both
Summers. She disagreed with Dr. Binger's pro
posal that contact with interested adults was the
solution to the problem, however, saying that talk
ing wilh and gaining the understanding of one's
contemporaries was most helpful in alleviating the
depression he spoke of.
FROM LAG ALSO comes the idea that Dr.
Binger didn't go far enough inlo finding a solution.
Giving every person the feeling that they have
something worthwile in themselves was named as
Ihe most important aspect of the problem.
The problem of depression among college
women is as real and immediate according to
Dawn Dyer of Florence Moore. She disagreed,
however, with Dr. Binger's idea that close contact
between the sexes is undesirable. "It's an abnor
mal situation to be separated most of the time and
then thrown together in an intimate situation on a
date."
From Branner comes the most typical reaction
although it can't be generalized to include every
girl in every school, it was thought provoking and
I remarkably accurate article which enabled us to
understand better what most of us go through at
1 one time or another.

Student comment on tho article was consider
ably varied. It was "amazing how close these
things hil home" according In Ruble President Both
Summers. She disagreed with Dr. Binger's pro
posal that contact with interested adults was the
solution to the problem, however, saying that talk
ing wilh and gaining the understanding of one's
contemporaries was most helpful in alleviating the
depression he spoke of.
FROM LAG ALSO comes the idea that Dr.

The problem of depression among college
women is as real and immediate according to
Dawn Dyer of Florence Moore. She disagreed,
however, with Dr. Binger's idea that close contact
between the sexes is undesirable. "It's an abnor
mal situation to be separated most of the time and
then thrown together in an intimate situation on a
date."
From Branner comes the most typical reaction

Coinniont on the article "The Pressures on Col
lege Girls Today" by Dr. Carl Binger which was
printed in the Daily last week has aroused wide
spread and varied comment among students and
faculty.
Remarks on the article range from "amusing"
and "noi worth reading" to "excellent" and "true
for Stanford in every detail."
IT WAS AN " accurate, insightful and sensitive
discussion of the problem," according to Dr. John
Black, director of the Counseling and Testing Cen
ter. On the subject of depression among college
women he said, "the article points to a real prob
lem. Because it's not as severe or the same for
everyone doesn't mean that it's not a problem."
Dr. Eleanor Maccoby of the Psychology Depart
ment agreed with Dr. Binger that men are an ex
ceedingly important bulwark for a girl's self
esteem but pointed out thai with the lengthening
life span girls now can have time for a career as
well as a home and family.
Miss Elva Brown, Dean of Women, also spoke
along these lines. It is no longer a matter of being
a wife and mother or a career women but rather
a matter of assuming multiple roles. "A woman
has to think in long terms to think ahead when
her children are grown and her time will be free."
IN COMMENTING on Dr. Ringer's statement

further opportunity to meet men. Dr. Lois Sloltz.
Professor Emeritus of the Psychology Department,

an obligation to consider the ethics involved in ac-

cepting a fellowship.
On women's use of an education she pointed out
that "we have 1 educated more and more women in
the last hundred years but at the present lime we
are only beginning to extend their role so they can
use their education."
