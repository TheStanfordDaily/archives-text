UNITED NATIONS. N.Y. < UPI)
The Soviet Union last night de
manded that the United Nations
fire Secretary-General Dag Mam
marskjold, withdraw completely
from The Congo, and impose sanc
tions against Belgium for actions
which Russia said led to the mur
der of Patrice Lumumba.
A draft resolution sumbitted for
today's Security Council session
in effect placed before the council
the Russian declaration published
yesterday in Moscow which said
the blood Lumumba, ousted pre
mier of The Congo, was on Ham
marskjold's hands.
The United States and Britain
already have announced their sup
port of the beleaguered Secretary-
General who weathered a Soviet
assult over the world organiza
tion's actions in the crisis torn
African nation last fall.
| Russia's resolution also de-
I manded:
• THE AKICKST of President
Moise Tshombe of Breakaway Ka
tanga Province, where Lumumba
was killed, and of Maj. Gen. Jo
seph Mobutu, both foes of Lu
mumbist factions in The Congo;
• Disarming of all troops under
their command;
• Expulsion of all Belgiansfrom
The Congo.
The resolution would direct that
United Nations operations in The
Congo halt within a month and all
foreign troops be withdrawn "so
as to enable the Congolese people
to decide its own internal affairs."
TODAY'S Security Council ses
sion is expected to be one of the
most explosive in the United Na
tions' 15-year history.
First speaker listed is U.S. Am
bassador Adlai E. Stevenson, who
hinted yesterday that the United
States and other nations might
submit a new Congo peace plan
that contained "some elements"
previously missing.
Russia's resolution was circu
lated by Soviet Ambassador Val
erian Zorin for presentation at
the session.
IT CALLED for sanctions
against Belgium for what it
termed "flagrant violation" of
U.N. declarations on the granting
of independence to colonial coun
tries.
The resolution said that the
Soviet Union "deems it essential
that the sanctions provided under
Article 41 of the U.N. charter
should be applied to Belgium as
to an aggressor, which, by its
action, has created a threat to
international peace and requires
of the states members of the
United Nations the immediate im
plementation of these sanctions."
