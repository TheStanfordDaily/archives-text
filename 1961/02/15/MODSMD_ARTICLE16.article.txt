# Eating Clubs Also Have Advantages
## 
### 
A recent letter in the Daily indi
cated that "the possibilities for
meeting foreign students through
membership in a fraternity are
great" and implied that associa
tion with foreign students is an
attraction peculiarly inherent in
Stanford fraternity lifeâ€”as op
posed to life in other Stanford
living or eating groups. We would
like merely to prevent any distor
tion or misrepresentation of the
facts and to point out to the Frosh
that the possibilities for meeting
foreign students through member
ship in one of Stanford's Eating
Clubs are equally great, if not
greater. The implication that fra
ternities enjoy any particular ad
vantage in this respect is false and
uncalled for.
In addition to many of the fra
ternities, all seven of the Stanford
Eating Clubs are participating
this year in the ASSU Foreign
Scholarship Program and are
hosting ASSU scholars for one or
more quarters. Presently there
are four other ASSU scholars at
the clubs. The Eating Clubs are
also entertaining 13 other foreign
students, both as guests and, in
several cases, as regular members.
One club has recently chosen a
student from Iran as its club pres
ident. We are very satisfied with
the success of the foreign student
program at the clubs and are con
fident that this success will con
tinue.
The attempt in the recent letter
to treat the issue of foreign stu
dents in the context of rushing is
unnecessary and, to be frank, a
bit silly, and it loses sight of the
purposes of the program. We en
join those who have used the for
eign student issue as a rushing
tactic and a partisan appeal to
promote instead the values of in
viting foreign students into living
and eating groups throughout the
campus. We recognize the impor
tance of entertaining foreign stu
dents on the Stanford campus and
the benefits to be derived there
from, both for ourselves and our
foreign guests. We hope that it is
on this basis that moi % e Stanford
groups will be induced to partici
pate in the foreign program.
