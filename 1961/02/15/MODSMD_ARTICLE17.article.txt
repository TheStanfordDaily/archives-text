# Schlick Sees Constructive Thinking

A ray of constructive thinking
came through in your feature
article of Tuesday, Eeb. 7th, and
entitled, "Let's Throw a Big Nazi
Rally in New York." Uene Strelitz
focuses our attention on the fact
that aside from the violence which
is being done to a guaranteed free
dom, namely that of speech, the
authorities in New York have in
actuality provided a boost to the
cause of George Rockwell.
In colorful and expert form, she
points out that his message lacks
facts and is otherwise intellect
ually bankrupt. This will doom
his venom ridden cause to sink of
its own weight.
There are however, certain pro
semitic overtones to her writings
which do not withstand the heat
of the detached scrutiny. They
should be dispelled because they
misinform those unutuored in a
highly esoteric subject. By the
latter, I refer to the complexion
of New York City and the status
of anti-semitism therein.
For instance, 1 quote: "Would
a New York Rally have turned the
city into a screaming mob? Hard
ly, with the population consisting
of Puerto Ricans, Negroes, Cath
olics, and Jews. . . .
Miss Strelitz should realize that
even if limited to the 7 per cent
white Protestant population of
Manhattan, still he could draw a
sizeable crowd. Furthermore,
Manhattan has long been the
gathering point and fun-spot of
suburbia. The implication which
is most objectionable, however, is
that the thought cancer which af
flicts Mr. Rockwell may only be
contagious to the group under
reference.
Quite to the contrary, Father
Coughlin and Joey McWilliams,
have been the most successful
anti-semites of recent vintage to
make their influence felt in New
York. The harassment and ex
pulsion of the latter from New
York was one of the sorriest
abuses of power by city officials
ever to be undertaken. The "Har
lem Day Riots" which he engend
ered are eloquent testimony to Ihe
support which this Catholic rab
ble-rouse, who forgot the teach
ings of his Church, could garner
among the Negroes. The Mayor's
Race Relations Council, and other
enlightened groups, have long
been combatting the hate and
misunderstanding which some
Puerto Ricans and Negroes pro
ject out from their Jewish employ
ers to the Jewish community at
large. Father Tomasiello has also
had his mis informed hate group
operating in New York at times.
"Common Sense," the anti-semitic
magazine which she quotes, is not

owned and edited by a "white
protestant."
Remember, Gerald L. T\. Smith
is out here on the West Coast, and
I know of no counterpart which
he might have in New York City.
What is more vital to all of us,
is to comprehend the message
which leaders of all faiths are try
ing to propagate. The American
Jewish Committee, for one, has
long reminded us that a man's
religious beliefs should not serve
to segregate him from the stream
of common interest, nor to lay
claim to special group privileges.
