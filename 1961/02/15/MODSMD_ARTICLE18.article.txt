## Opinion Page Murry Claims Distortion Of Packard Industry Speech 
### 
In your editorial in Monday's
issue, you accuse Mr. Vance Pack
ard of "clouding the consumer pic
ture" by his assertions regarding
industry's "waste-makers." It ap
pears that you have, in order to
fill some space on your editorial
page, distorted the meaning of
Mr. Packard's remarks to indicate
that he is opposed to progress of
any kind, and advocates a return
to conditions prevailing 300 or
more years ago. Perhaps I'm un
duly dense, but I certainly got no
such impression from Mr. Pack
ard's talk. To me, he appeared to
give a fairly true picture of pres
ent-day conditions, although in a
rather roundabout manner, leav
ing much unsaid.
Basically, he claimed that Amer
ican industry must attarct cus
tomers to stay in business. For
this, various manufacturing and
advertising methods are used.
Sometimes the result is a product
built flimsily to lower its cost and

permit a more competitive selling
price, and at the same time adver
tising which tends to conceal the
product's shortcomings by concen
trating on its good or new fea
tures ("good" and "new" being
put forth with the implication
that they are synonymous). Qual
ity which does not show costs
money and does not help sales
proportionately hence the mod
ern automobile with its paper
thin body which rusts through at
the slightest provocation. This is
not due to its being "a complex
machine of many operating
parts," to quote your editorial, but
is simply a means of cheapening
the product without appearing to
do so.
Another technique he brought
out is the appeal marie to the cus
tomer's physical and mental lazi
ness. As an example, consider the
automatic transmission. In the
case of the amputee there's ample
justification for it. For the rest
of us, it adds unnecessary weight
to the car, increases fuel consump
tion and maintenance costs, and
perhaps contributes to the even
tual weakening of our left legs
and one or two brain cells due to
lack of use. Yet we've allowed
ourselves to become convinced
that we need it, until many of us
actually do.
The automotive field is certain
ly not the only one which illus
trates the trend to boasting sales
by cheapening the product and
encouraging the customer's lazi
ness and desire to "keep up with
the Joneses." A dozen or so years
ago many of the popular light air
planes were built like the prover
bial brick privyâ€”anything short
of an out-and-out crash wouldn't
destroy them. I have flown such
a plane, an old Stinson, extensive
ly around the south Caribbean Is
lands and Venezuela, sometimes
into jungle airstrips marked only
by a row of beer cans. I would
have felt less comfortable trying
this sort of thing with most of
the modern light planes, which
are designed closer to the limit of
necessary strength and instead
provide such amenities as a nose
wheel, adding unnecessary weight
and drag, in exchange for reduced
skill required in ground handling.
Again, this sort of thing sells
planes, so obviously only crack
pots like Packard and Murry will
complain.
As one engineer who favors
function and durability rather
than flashy claims and larger tail
fins, I say bully for Mr. Packard!
Let's hope he continues his efforts
to wake up the public, even if the
public prefers to sleep.
