# Wood Believes Editor's Scope Too Large
## 
### 
Reflect for a moment on the
purposes and potentialities of a
college newspaper. During the
last two weeks, both preceding
and following the change of edi
tors, we have been treated to a
series of would-be world-reform
ing editorials dealing with Free
dom, Peace, the Communist Men
ace, the Duty of the Western
World. Walter Lippmann himself,
appearing on the same page, does
not often attempt to bite off
chunks as large as those which
the editors try to chew, digest, and
assimilate into two or three short
paragraphs. Failing to do so satis
factorily, they are nevertheless
content to present their efforts to
us, in the form in which all
members of the animal kingdom
return indigestible material to
their environment.
The absurdity and futility of
such sermonizing need hardly be
pointed out. The Daily should be
able to assume that its readers
will obtain most of their informa
tion on politics and current events
from the public press, radio, and
other sources outside of the Uni
versity. Inadequate though these
sources may be in this area, a
publication of the Daily's scope
cannot possibly substitute for
them. Consider their existence
and availability, the Daily's prac
tice of devoting considerable space
to Associated Press reports and
editorials on current events seem
not only superfluous, but a little
wasteful, in view of a neglected
task at Stanford with which a stu
dent newspaper might well con
cern itself.
Taking the well-known student
publication of another university
as a model, let us consider an al
ternative approach to college
journalism. First, this newspaper
refrains from all but occasional
comment on world affairs, as
suming, as stated above, that at
its level such comment is usually
unnecessary and unjustified. It
devotes itself instead to promot
ing the cultural and intellectual
tradition of the university com
munity. It encourages mature
journalism, Ihc correct and ef
fective use of the English lan
guage. It features reviews and
criticism of local art and drama,
reporting of community events,
and articles dealing with current
and historical aspects of student
life and university institutions.
It provides, for the undergrad
uate as well as the outsider, some
insight into the many purposes,
programs, and problems of the
university. It provides also, as
any free newspaper should, the
opportunity for individuals to
sound their own views. The voices
heard, however, are more often

those of would-be critics or edu
cators than those of would-be
world-reformers, and their com
ments, though sometimes as ab
surd as those mentioned above,
somehow do not seem quite so out
of place.
One of Mr. Grcenberg's pet
dodges was to assure us that his
paper in no way reflected the
views of the majority of Stanford
students. Might not the Daily be
taken much more seriously if it
were to reflect something more
than the personal viewpoints of
its editors? It would be clearly
impossible for it to mirror the
political opinion of so large a
community, but there would be
no benefit even if this were pos
sible. What it might represent,
with great benefit to Stanford, is
that which makes the university
more than just a group of people
who inhabit a campus, a common
belief in the importance of learn
ing and the value of education. If
Stanford is ever to become Ihe
least bit deserving of ihe nick
name "Harvard of the West," it
will be only when there has come
to exist among the students an in
tellectual tradition which is now
seldom in evidence. An enlight
ened student newspaper could be
instrumental in fostering such a
tradition. It would require much
imagination, reorganization, and
thoughtful work. It might be
worth the effort.

Chandler Interest?
Were Norman Chandler's con
tributions to Stanford rewarded
with the controlling interest in the
Daily?
