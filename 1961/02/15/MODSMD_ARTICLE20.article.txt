# McRae Urges Influence

### 
Leaving a lecture in Profpssor
Buss's Far East class last Mon
day, in which he read an article
describing student opinion and
action, I rcmomherpd all the
chances we have had this past
year to listen to top-notch speak
ers and to discuss in small groups
through the Political Union, lIR,
ICenter, and the "Y" some of the
issues these speakers bring up.
However, most of our opinions
extend to distant places; and we
have little idea of what to do
with them except discuss them
with other students. We hope
vaguely to influence big fish; per
haps we should start on smaller
fish first.
Many students have really
never thought of all the ways in
which they can make their opin
ions felt: letters to influential

people, demonstrations, boycotts,
petitioning, sit-ins or passive re
sistante, to name just a few. Often
people have strong opinions for or
against some of these methods.
I would like to see the campus in
terest in a group to study and dis
cuss both the pros and cons of
these methods, which can move
into some areas of local concern
with a better idea of what can be
done.
I have arranged for a meeting
on Wednesday from 12 to 1 in the
"Y" Lounge, third floor, Women's
Clubhouse. Professor Buss will be
at ihe first meeting to give some
of his thoughts and enthusiasm
on the subject. Bring your own
lunches this time and if we decide
to meet regularly, we will make
arrangements for lunch to be I
served by the "Y." Come!
