# IIR to Blame Says Sterling
## 
### 
I am writing with regard to Mr.
Rankin's article of Feb. 13 on
LASSU. The lIR is grateful for
his concern and for the generous
treatment the Daily has always
accorded us. But in all fairness to
LASSU it must be pointed out
that lIR failed 1o supply the mem
bers of Legislature with sufficient
information. LASSU therefore
had quite reasonable grounds for
reaching a decision against appro
priating money from the Harri
man Fund for the African Desk
supplement.
This coming Thursday the lIR
will ask LASSU to reconsider its
decision. And at that time lIR rep
resentatives will be present with
all the pertinent information and
with positive arguments for the
appropriation. It is our wish that
LASSU not be judged for an ac
tion in which chiefly the lIR is at
fault. I trust that this letter may
serve to exculpate LASSU from
any unfair condemnation.
