# New Products Not Superior
## 
### 
The undersigned do not agree
with your editorial of Monday,
Feb. 13 which accuses Mr. Pack
ard of indiscriminently attacking
manufacturers. Your argument is
based on the assumption that the
new products are far superior to
the ones of five years ago. "ft is
rather short-sighted to believe
that a brand-new television set is
equal to one that is five years
old." This is to some extent true
since five years ago television had
become popular enough so thai
manufacturers could unload any
thing with a new-style cabinet on
the public. The operating features
of the set were designed primarily
to cut cost, and this results in
overworked components which
have undoubtedly failed by now.
However, if we go back 15 years
to when television was in its in
fancy we have a different story.
When RCA pioneered commercial
television they could not afford
maintenance troubles with their
sets, and as a result produced a
conservatively designed set which
has few equals today. Many of
these sets, the 630, are in opera
tion today, having needed little
but occasional alignment, and
they are still in demand by tech
nicians and servicemen who ap
preciate the quality workmanship.
This is just one example of the
lack of improvement with time.
There are certainly plenty of ex
amples in the automotive industry
and many others in different
fields. The point is that we are
tiled of cars that fall apart, of
nylons which run (they can be
made so they won't), of ice boxes
that change style every year, and
television sets where 25 per cent
of the cost is a gadget which turns
it on and off from across the
room. These aren't "outward signs
of inward improvements," they
are simply insurance that there
will be a market next year.
