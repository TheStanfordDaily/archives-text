Sinre when rlo our reps at
LASSU
Prevent us from publishing
things that are new???
If talk about Africa is too-often
heard,
Then space given Greek Week
is far more absurd.
What's this you're calling
representat ion,
When so many students would
give a donation
To a cause they deem worthy,
which you term expensive?
Your lack of perception seems
rather extensive.
When students will think and
plan an act.
It is ironic that they are
attacked
By some valiant leaders of
ASS 17
Who speak for initiative, but
never will do . . .
Anything . . .
Anyway . . .
