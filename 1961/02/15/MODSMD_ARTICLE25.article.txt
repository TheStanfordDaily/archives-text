# The 						Complete Playerâ€”He Can Do It All'
## 
### 
"Paul is iho complete basketball player." Dallmar will tell you.
"He can do it all run, pass, shoot, defend and above all lead his
team. I feel he is one of the best."
Those who saw "the impassive one" work his wonders on the
Farm in 1939, Paul's senior year, will never forget him and the thrills
he created.
NEUMAN WAS iho nexus on a team whose offensive punch was
carried almost totally by the sparkling guard and center Dick Haga.
Defense and ball control were ihe keys in the Cards' plans and Neu
mann and Haga were to handle the offensive chores.
The guy with the perpetual crewcut was something to behold as
he dribbled up court, faked his man into Haga's screen and pumped
that soft jumper from about 2.1 feet.
Hut Paul was the team-player supreme. Even in his last game for
the Tribe as lie stood on the threshold of the "1,000-point club"he
never forgot who he was and what he was playing for. He passed

adroitly from every angle imagi
nable for countless assists and
still scored 21 points to lead the
Stanford win. But he fell two
short of 1,000 markers. That's the
way i! is with Paul. He knows no
other. A good shot comes in sec
ond when an oven better pass can
be thrown.
The thrill of beholding Neu
mann play basketball, however,
lies in the fact that ho must be
watched and reckoned with every
second ho is on the hardwood.
Paul's talents are not truly ap
preciated by the layman for he is
not the flashy headline-stealing
type. Neumann is the classic ball
player. lie is for those who really
know.
He will not bo noticed first
when a box score appears in the

paper. He will not crack any seor- "Driving right, hooking left"
ing records. And he will not be
picked for all-star teams bas-ed mostly on publicity. But he usually
will be regarded as the most valuable man on his team.
THE IKON'V OF NEUMANN'S greatness is the fact that he does
not knock you off your seat the first time you see him. He moves so
effortlessly. He performs almost nonchalantly where others struggle.
He is without doubt one of the smoothese hoopsters in captivity today.
The traumas suffered by those who truly believe in this 22-year-old
stem partly from the fact that Paul is as good without the ball as
he is with it. Sure he can drive. Sure he can jump shoot. Sure he
can pass. But there is more.
When Neumann sets a screen it takes an exceptional defensive
man to fight his way through it and when Neumann guards someone
man-to-man that opponent knows he's been in a ball game.
He possess great speed and moves with such floating deception the
relative speeds of his change of pace can only be described by "fast
and faster."
ALTHOUGH HE IS TINY by today's skyscraper standards the
icey-veined playmaker has all the physical assets requisite for great
ness. He has explosive jumping power and at a mere 6-2 can dunk
with either hand or two-handed with ease. He can play either outside
or in a corner.
Paul has never truly received the acclaim that those close to the
scene know he deserves. When he joined the San Francisco Olympic
Club for tho AAU trials after the Card basketball season had ended in
1959 Paul showed his true potential. Coach Dallmar said "If Paul
can score with those boys I'll know he's ready. He'll have to be good.
He'll hardly ever see the ball." This observer journeyed to the city
of the cable cars to watch what would happen in the cruel world
outside the Pavilion.

can pass. But there is more.
When Neumann sets a screen it takes an exceptional defensive
man to fight his way through it and when Neumann guards someone
man-to-man that opponent knows he's been in a ball game.
He possess great speed and moves with such floating deception the
relative speeds of his change of pace can only be described by "fast
and faster."
ALTHOUGH HE IS TINY by today's skyscraper standards the
icey-veined playmaker has all the physical assets requisite for great
ness. He has explosive jumping power and at a mere 6-2 can dunk
with either hand or two-handed with ease. He can play either outside
or in a corner.
Paul has never truly received the acclaim that those close to the
scene know he deserves. When he joined the San Francisco Olympic
Club for tho AAU trials after the Card basketball season had ended in
1959 Paul showed his true potential. Coach Dallmar said "If Paul
can score with those boys I'll know he's ready. He'll have to be good.
He'll hardly ever see the ball." This observer journeyed to the city
of the cable cars to watch what would happen in the cruel world
outside the Pavilion.


PAUL NEUMANN
"Paul is iho complete basketball player." Dallmar will tell you.
"He can do it all run, pass, shoot, defend and above all lead his
team. I feel he is one of the best."
Those who saw "the impassive one" work his wonders on the
Farm in 1939, Paul's senior year, will never forget him and the thrills
he created.
NEUMAN WAS iho nexus on a team whose offensive punch was
carried almost totally by the sparkling guard and center Dick Haga.
Defense and ball control were ihe keys in the Cards' plans and Neu
mann and Haga were to handle the offensive chores.
The guy with the perpetual crewcut was something to behold as
he dribbled up court, faked his man into Haga's screen and pumped
that soft jumper from about 2.1 feet.
Hut Paul was the team-player supreme. Even in his last game for
the Tribe as lie stood on the threshold of the "1,000-point club"he
never forgot who he was and what he was playing for. He passed

adroitly from every angle imagi
nable for countless assists and
still scored 21 points to lead the
Stanford win. But he fell two
short of 1,000 markers. That's the
way i! is with Paul. He knows no
other. A good shot comes in sec
ond when an oven better pass can
be thrown.
The thrill of beholding Neu
mann play basketball, however,
lies in the fact that ho must be
watched and reckoned with every
second ho is on the hardwood.
Paul's talents are not truly ap
preciated by the layman for he is
not the flashy headline-stealing
type. Neumann is the classic ball
player. lie is for those who really
know.
He will not bo noticed first
when a box score appears in the

paper. He will not crack any seor- "Driving right, hooking left"
ing records. And he will not be
picked for all-star teams bas-ed mostly on publicity. But he usually
will be regarded as the most valuable man on his team.
THE IKON'V OF NEUMANN'S greatness is the fact that he does
not knock you off your seat the first time you see him. He moves so
effortlessly. He performs almost nonchalantly where others struggle.
He is without doubt one of the smoothese hoopsters in captivity today.
The traumas suffered by those who truly believe in this 22-year-old
stem partly from the fact that Paul is as good without the ball as
he is with it. Sure he can drive. Sure he can jump shoot. Sure he
can pass. But there is more.
