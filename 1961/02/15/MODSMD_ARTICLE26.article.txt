# Lions Into Pussy Cats
## 
### 
Paul sat on the bench the entire first half as guard Ron Tomsie
and his running male played a Southern California team about even.
Then they threw Paul to the lions and he turned them into pussy cats.
He hit ."3 of 8 shots from Hie field and added six perfect free throws
as the Winged 'O' won going away. He hit from his wide variety of
shots a jumper, a drive, a hook and even a long two-handed set
but it was his all-around play which stole the show. He stopped his op
ponent cold.
One tragedy that grow directly out of Paul's smooth efficiency
and sometimes deceptively nonchalant style occurred at the Olympic
trials at Denver last summer.
Paul's team was eliminated in the early going and he returned
to San Francisco. A call for help came the same night from the Phil
lips Oilers to return to Denver and help the Oklahomans but Paul was
"a little dubious about going back just to fill out their team." He went

on (in an interview during finals
week last quarter) "I talked to
San Francisco Investor Coach
Jim Walsh and he told me that he
thought I could crack the starting
lineup if 1 left immediately since
the Oilers had three days of prac
tice before they were to meet the
College All-Stars.
"When the day of the game ar
rived I started and drew Jerry
West on defense. I held him to 1
points in the first half on two long
jump shots from the outside.
However I didn't play much after
that first half as we went on to
heat the Armed Forces All-Star
Team and lost to Ohio State.
"Coach Bud Browning liked to
have two small, feeding, running
guards and he looked for the scor
ing up in the front line. I was kind
of disappointed I didn't get to
play more.

Last season the blue-eyed blond led tho San Francisco Investors
of the National Industrial Basketball League. After ihe franchise
folded up he was called by the New York Tuck Tapers of the same
league. Although Paul has also been drafted by the professional Syra
cuse Nationals he decided to join the Tapers because they were will
ing to let him miss 10 games while he finished his education. He now
holds a masters in education from Stanford.
"I knew that I would have to miss 10 games but 1 thought it es
sential to finish my education," he told me. "1 will get to play in 24
games though and I hope I'll be able to help New York."
I queried Paul on what he had planned for the future.
"I'm not quile sure at the moment," he grinned," I guess a lot
of it depends on how well I play with the Tapers.
"Eventually I would like to go into teaching and coaching. My
wife and I will probably make New Roehelle our permanent home.
Possibly I could play and coach. You know Howie Dallmar coached
Perm State and played for the Philadelphia Warriors at the same
time!
Finally I had to ask it: "Do you think you could make it with
Ihe pros?"
A reverently modest Neuman answered: "It's always in the back
of your mind. I'd certainly like to give it a try. And of course there's
only one way If) find out. I'd sure hate to let the opportunity slip by
and someday still be wondering."
It was tlic type of answer I had expected from one who has Hie
respect of all who know him. Those who know him well are ini
placcahle. Neuman is good enough (o play in any league.
