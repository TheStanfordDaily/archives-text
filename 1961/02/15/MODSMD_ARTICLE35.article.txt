I know all of you have important Ihings to do in (lie morning—
like netting down to breakfast before your roommate eats all
I lie marmalade—so you really cannot be blamed for not keeping
up with all the news in the morning papers. In today's column,
therefore, I have prepared a run-up of news highlights from
campuses the country over.
SOUTHERN RESERVE .UNIVERSITY
])r. \\ i I lard Hale Sigaloos, head of the department of anthro
pology at Southern Reserve University, and internationally
known as an authority on primitive peoples, returned yesterday
lrom a four-year scientific expedition to the headwaters of the
Amazon l!iver. Among the many interesting mementos of his
journey is his own head, shrunk to the size of a kumquat. He
r<!used to reveal how 11i> head shrinking was accomplished.
"That's for me to know and you to find out," he said with a
tinv, but saucy grin.
NORTHERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY
Dr. Mandrill (iibbon, head of the department of zoology at
Northern Reserve I Diversity, and known to young and old for
his work 011 primates, announced yesterday that he had re
ceived a grant of SSI UK )l ).<)<)( I for a twelve-year study to deter
mine precisely how much fun there is in a barrel of monkeys.
Whatever the results ol I )r. (libbon's researches, this much
is already known: What's more fun than a barrel of monkevs is

ii i>:ic*.k ol Marlboro. Thorn is zest and cheer in every puff,
delight in every draw, contont and well-being in every fleecy,
flavorful cloudlet. And what's more, this merriest of cigarettes
conies to you both in soft pack and flip-top box wherever cig
arettes are sold at prices that do no violence to the slimmest, of
purses. So why don't you settle back soon and enjoy Marlboro,
the filtered cigarette with the unfiltered taste.
EASTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY
The annual meeting of the American Philological Institute,
held last week at Eastern Reserve University, was enlivened
by the reading ol two divergent monographs concerning the
origins of early Gothic "runes," as letters of primitive alphabets
are called.
I )r. Trisl ram Lathrop Spleen, famed far and wide as the dis
coverer of the High German Consonant Shift, read a paper in
which he traced the origins of the Old Wendish rune "pt"
(pronounced "kralitz") to tlx* middle Lottie rune "gr" (pro
nounced "albert"). < )n the other hand, Dr. Hichard Cummer
bund I'woiikov, who, as the whole world knows, translated
" 1 lie Pajania Game" into Middle Ilifih Bactrian, contended
in his paper that the Old Wendish rune "pt" derives from the
Low Erse rune "mf" (pronounced "gr").
Well, sir the discussion grew so heated that Dr. Twonkoy
finally asked Dr. Spleen il lie would like to step into the gym
nasium and put 011 the gloves. Dr. Spleen accepted the chal
lenge promptly, but the contest was never held because there
were no gloves in the gymnasium that would fit Dr. Twonkoy.
CI he reader is doubtless finding this bard to believe as
Eastern Reserve I diversity is celebrated the length and breadth
of the land for the size ol its glove collection. However, the
reader is asked to remember that Dr. Twonkoy Inis extraor
dinarily small hands and arms. In fact, he spent the last
war working in a small-arms plant, where lie received two
Navy "E" Awards and was widely hailed as a "manly little
