HAVANA (UPI) — Premier
Fidel Castro held out an olive
branch to the United Stales yes
terday, saying he had no desire
to continue hostility towards
Washington and that he hoped
eventually to re-establish friendly
political relations between the two
countries.
But first, he said, the United
States must halt what he de
scribed as its active support of the
foes of his administration.
The Cuban leader charged that
the "Pentagon" and the "Central
Intelligence Agency" are organ
izing daily air-drops of weapons
to anti-Castro guerrilla forces in
the Escambray mountains of cen
tral Cuba and said this was "an
obvious impediment to peaceful
relations."
HE INDICATED the U.S. also
must accept Cuba's close eco
nomic ties with Communist na
tions but said such ties were "to
tally without political commit
ments." Soviet diplomats arc
"Friendly," he said, while U.S. en
voys treat Latin American gov
ernments "like impertinent fore
men."
lie suggested that if President
Kennedy were to demonstrate "by
deeds" that Washington would
not "interfere" in Cuban internal
affairs, Cuba was prepared to "do
its part" to reduce Western hem
isphere tensions.
AGAIN, HOWEVER, Castro
made it plain that he conditioned
a change in the Cuban official at
titude on U.S. action to halt what
he repeatedly alleged to be Wash
ington's "direct military support"
of his adversaires.
