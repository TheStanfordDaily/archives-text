# Congo Solution Is Possible, Bunche Says
## Lumumba Now 'Martyr', UN Official Declares 
### NICK WESSELL 
A solution of the Congo problem is possible, despite the crisis
arising from the murder of Patrice Lumumba, Dr. Halpli Bundle
told a capacity Memorial Auditorium audience yesterday.
Bunclie, United Nations undersecretary for political affairs,
said that though the long-term results of the murder are difficult

to predict, "his death makes him
a martyr."
KEYNOTING the fourth an
nual Institute of International Re
lations Foreign Policy Institute,
Bunche said "But in spite of this
(Lumumba's death i and other dis
couraging fiascos on the interna
tional level, I continue to be opti
mistic that we can avert World
War III."
He predicted, however, that the
death of the former Congo pre
mier would have "widespread and
profound repercussions."
Bunche also lavished praise on
embattled I J.N. Secretary-General
Dag Hammarskjold, saying "I
know of no man more dedicated,
no man of greater integrity and
ability than" Hammarskjold.
"THE PEOPLE of emerging na
tions have no truer friend, no
greater champion of freedom,
dignity and human rights."
In his speech, Bunche warned
that the cold war has now entered
Africa in earnest and that Ameri
cans should condition themselves
to reading of dictatorship, Com
munist inroads and violence on
the continent.
He said that 26 more African
nations will be admitted to the
United Nations in the next five
years. This would give the conti
nent a great new importance, and
Africa will hold the rest of the
world responsible for helping it
develop itself, he declared.
"FOR FOUR centuries the
world has taken much from Af
rica. The descendents of those peo
ple who suffered under subjuga
tion and colonialism have the
right to expect international co
operation to help establish them
selves."
In a subsequent press confer
ence, Bunche was asked if Bel
gium had made a mistake in
granting the Congo independence.
He asserted that Belgium had had
no choice; if she had refused or
delayed, revolt would have been
certain.
Bunche said the Congo's trouble
is attributable to six main factors
which led to the "tragic develop
ments":
• The incredible lack of prepa
ration of the Congolese for inde
pendence.
• Built-in weaknesses because
of conflicts between leaders and
tribes.
• The mutiny of the 25,000
member Congolese army in an ef
fort to get African officers.
• The summoning of Belgian
paratroopers which led to fear
and hysteria among Africans.
• U.N. intervention.
• The anarchy which the U.N.
could not correct.
Bunche explained t hat the
United Nations "operates on
hope" and that he is a "profes
sional optimist."
In this vein, he held "I am firm
ly convinced that the U.N. is the
only means of securing an inde
pendent Africa for the Africans."

lations Foreign Policy Institute,
Bunche said "But in spite of this
(Lumumba's death i and other dis
couraging fiascos on the interna
tional level, I continue to be opti
mistic that we can avert World
War III."
He predicted, however, that the
death of the former Congo pre
mier would have "widespread and
profound repercussions."
Bunche also lavished praise on
embattled I J.N. Secretary-General
Dag Hammarskjold, saying "I
know of no man more dedicated,
no man of greater integrity and
ability than" Hammarskjold.
"THE PEOPLE of emerging na
tions have no truer friend, no
greater champion of freedom,
dignity and human rights."
In his speech, Bunche warned
that the cold war has now entered
Africa in earnest and that Ameri
cans should condition themselves
to reading of dictatorship, Com
munist inroads and violence on
the continent.
He said that 26 more African
nations will be admitted to the
United Nations in the next five
years. This would give the conti
nent a great new importance, and
Africa will hold the rest of the
world responsible for helping it
develop itself, he declared.
"FOR FOUR centuries the
world has taken much from Af
rica. The descendents of those peo
ple who suffered under subjuga
tion and colonialism have the
right to expect international co
operation to help establish them
selves."
In a subsequent press confer
ence, Bunche was asked if Bel
gium had made a mistake in
granting the Congo independence.
He asserted that Belgium had had
no choice; if she had refused or
delayed, revolt would have been
certain.
Bunche said the Congo's trouble
is attributable to six main factors
which led to the "tragic develop
ments":
• The incredible lack of prepa
ration of the Congolese for inde
pendence.
• Built-in weaknesses because
of conflicts between leaders and
tribes.
• The mutiny of the 25,000
member Congolese army in an ef
fort to get African officers.
• The summoning of Belgian
paratroopers which led to fear
and hysteria among Africans.
• U.N. intervention.
• The anarchy which the U.N.
could not correct.
Bunche explained t hat the
United Nations "operates on
hope" and that he is a "profes
sional optimist."
In this vein, he held "I am firm
ly convinced that the U.N. is the
only means of securing an inde
pendent Africa for the Africans."
