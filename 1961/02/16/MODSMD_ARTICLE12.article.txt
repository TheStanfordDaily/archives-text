# No Tears, Sympathy For Mr. Creighton
## 
### 
We can't show much sympathy for the moaning of University
of California ROTC cadet James L, Creighton that he has been
maligned.
Mr. Creighton is the student who picketed against compulsory
ROTC—in his uniform —against the express wishes of the Prof, of
Military Science, Col. J. T. Malloy. Col. Malloy, before the demon
stration, had issued a dictum that "any uniformed cadets taking
part in picketing, might find difficulty in passing the course." Mr.
Creighton picketed and thus flunked the course, although he had
an "A" at mid-term.
The guestion of the right to picket is not the guestion, although
members of the American Civil Liberties Union have been trying
to make it seem so. However, no one will argue the fact that Mr.
Creighton had a perfect right to picket in civilian clothes, since he
then would be acting as a private citizen. What is clearly wrong
is the wearing of a military uniform of the United States Army and
picketing. The wearing of the uniform is a symbol that the wearer
has acguiesced to the obedience that is organic to being a member
of the military. The wearer knows that wherever the uniform is
seen it is viewed as being a part of the United States Armed Forces
and in a larger sense of the United States itself. To desecrate this
uniform by campaigning against it while wearing it shows as much
logic as a policeman in uniform getting drunk in a neighborhood
saloon. The policeman would be immediately dropped from the
force. Mr. Creighton deserved to be dropped from the force, which
is what his "F" signalized.
The much-maligned Mr. Creighton says he will appeal the grade
to UC's Academic Senate. We know that these learned gentlemen
will uphold Col. Malloy's decision.
