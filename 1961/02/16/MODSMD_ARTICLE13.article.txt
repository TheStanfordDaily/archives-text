## Secretary Rusk Should Avoid Personal Diplomacy Trips 
### 
Secretary Rusk is said to be
under considerable pressure to
cross the Pacific in order to at
tend a meeting of SEATO in
Eangkok. Two Asian members of
the South East Asia Treaty Or
ganiation, the Philippines and
Thailand, are dissatisfied, it would
appear, with the unwillingness of
Great Britain and France to hot
up the Loation trouble, and they
are threatening to withdraw from
SEATO. Only Secretary Rusk,
they say, can dissuade them, and
to do this he must go to Bangkok.
No one else can dissuade them.
Only the Secretary of State in per
son.
It will be a pity if so early in the

iday Mr. Rusk al
lows himself to
be lured back
into the dreary
and unprofitable
ways of itinerant
summitry. No
body knows bet
ter than he, no
one has spoken
more cogently
about the weak
nesses of this

kind of diplomacy. It takes the
Secretary of State away from
Washington where he cannot be
spared. It subjects him to a physi
cal and nervous strain which he
should not be asked to bear. It
downgrades the authority of the
American Ambassadors on the
spot, and of the roving ambassa
dor, Gov. Harriman, who may be
needed to represent the United
States to regional negotiations. It
sets a precedent. If the Secretary
must go to SEATO, then in no
time at all he will have to go to
the centers of all the other pacts—
to CENTO, to NATO, to OAS. He
must go also to th'.» neighboring
states whose prestige will be hurt
if he does not visit them. Before
he knows it, he will be visiting
Formosa and Japan and so on and
on.
THIS IS as good a time as any
to turn over a new leaf and to set
new precedents. The Philippines
and Thailand have ambassadors,
able ambassadors, in Washington.
Let them be asked to explain to
their governments why the Secre
tary of State cannot leave Wash
ington when a new Administra
tion is just forming. Let them be
told that the American Ambassa
dors in Bangkok and Manila will
have instructions backed by the
full authority of our government.
Moreover, let us begin to un
tangle the error of high policy,
which has been to treat pacts of
guarantee, like SEATO, as instru
ments which the United States is
trying to sell. The United States
guarantee has been tossed around
very loosely. To an unnecessary
degree we have been profligate
with our guarantees. We have
given the impression to the world
that they are to be regarded as
something we are seeking rather
than as something that, carefully
and frugally, we occasionally give.

In our relations with the great
powers of Western Europe and
the Soviet Union, the firmest be
liever in quiet diplomacy will
agree that, following his meeting
with Mr. Macmillian, it would be
useful if the President had a
chance to talk face to face with
Gen. De Gaulle, with Dr. Ade
nauer, and with Mr. Khrushchev.
The real impartance of face to
face meetings with these men is
not that it is a substitute for quite
negotiation but that it facilitates
quiet negotiation. The heads of
government need to know what
kind of man their ambassadors
are telling them about. They need
to see the man and to hear him,
and not only to try to imagine him
from photographs and cartoons.
But this act of getting acquaint
ed, which is desirable for the new
President, must resolutely be kept
from becoming inflated into sum
mitry. One precaution is to have
it understood that a formal sum
mit meeting is not now in pros
pect. Another precaution is for the
President to avoid travelling
abroad at least until he has fin
ished with his legislative pro
gram. including foreign aid and
defense. This would mean that at
least until next summer face to
face meetings would have to take
place in Washington or in New
York.
MR. KHRUSHCHEV has, it ap
pears, had explained to him the
reasons why the new Administra
tion needs time to form its policy
on the great issues. Time is needed
for study and for debate and for
decision. Time is needed also for
public education. It is not now
possible, for example, to have a
fruitful negotiation about arms
control or about new ways of
guaranteeing the freedom of the
people of West Berlin. In these
matters the air is still too full of
spooks.
If this is understood, it would
be an advantage if Mr. Khru
shchev could visit this country,
let us say in April after Mr. Mac
millan has been here. He might
come to the U.N. and on to Wash
ington. Mr. Khrushchev and Mr.
Kennedy had better get to know
one another since they will be
dealing with one another on such
critical questions. This will be a
demonstration that diplomatic in
tercourse has been restored after
the rupture of last May. If this
strengthens Mr. Khrushchev at
home and among his Communist
allies, we can count that as being
to the general advantage.
One of the prime lessons of the
Eisenhower-Khrushchev dealings
is, I believe, that personal sum
mitry cannot succeed unless in the
interval between the big meetings
there is persistent and imaginat
tive quiet diplomacy. The reason
for the disaster in May is to be
found, it seems to me, in the seven
months of diplomatic drifting and
inadvertence which took place
after Mr. Khrushchev's visit to
Washington.

and not only to try to imagine him
from photographs and cartoons.
But this act of getting acquaint
ed, which is desirable for the new

from becoming inflated into sum
mitry. One precaution is to have
it understood that a formal sum
mit meeting is not now in pros
pect. Another precaution is for the
President to avoid travelling
abroad at least until he has fin
ished with his legislative pro

MR. KHRUSHCHEV has, it ap

public education. It is not now
possible, for example, to have a
fruitful negotiation about arms
control or about new ways of
guaranteeing the freedom of the
people of West Berlin. In these
matters the air is still too full of
spooks.

be an advantage if Mr. Khru

let us say in April after Mr. Mac
millan has been here. He might
come to the U.N. and on to Wash
ington. Mr. Khrushchev and Mr.
Kennedy had better get to know
one another since they will be
dealing with one another on such
critical questions. This will be a
demonstration that diplomatic in
tercourse has been restored after
the rupture of last May. If this
strengthens Mr. Khrushchev at
home and among his Communist
allies, we can count that as being
to the general advantage.
One of the prime lessons of the
Eisenhower-Khrushchev dealings
is, I believe, that personal sum
mitry cannot succeed unless in the

there is persistent and imaginat

for the disaster in May is to be

months of diplomatic drifting and
inadvertence which took place
after Mr. Khrushchev's visit to

Secretary Rusk is said to be
under considerable pressure to
cross the Pacific in order to at
tend a meeting of SEATO in
Eangkok. Two Asian members of
the South East Asia Treaty Or
ganiation, the Philippines and
Thailand, are dissatisfied, it would
appear, with the unwillingness of
Great Britain and France to hot
up the Loation trouble, and they
are threatening to withdraw from
SEATO. Only Secretary Rusk,
they say, can dissuade them, and
to do this he must go to Bangkok.
No one else can dissuade them.
Only the Secretary of State in per
son.
It will be a pity if so early in the

iday Mr. Rusk al
lows himself to
be lured back
into the dreary
and unprofitable
ways of itinerant
summitry. No
body knows bet
ter than he, no
one has spoken
more cogently
about the weak
nesses of this

kind of diplomacy. It takes the
Secretary of State away from
Washington where he cannot be
spared. It subjects him to a physi
cal and nervous strain which he
should not be asked to bear. It
downgrades the authority of the
American Ambassadors on the
spot, and of the roving ambassa
dor, Gov. Harriman, who may be
needed to represent the United
States to regional negotiations. It
sets a precedent. If the Secretary
must go to SEATO, then in no
time at all he will have to go to
the centers of all the other pacts—
to CENTO, to NATO, to OAS. He
must go also to th'.» neighboring
states whose prestige will be hurt
if he does not visit them. Before
he knows it, he will be visiting
Formosa and Japan and so on and
on.
THIS IS as good a time as any
to turn over a new leaf and to set
new precedents. The Philippines
and Thailand have ambassadors,
able ambassadors, in Washington.
Let them be asked to explain to
their governments why the Secre
tary of State cannot leave Wash
ington when a new Administra
tion is just forming. Let them be
told that the American Ambassa
dors in Bangkok and Manila will
have instructions backed by the
full authority of our government.
Moreover, let us begin to un
tangle the error of high policy,
which has been to treat pacts of
guarantee, like SEATO, as instru
ments which the United States is
trying to sell. The United States
guarantee has been tossed around
very loosely. To an unnecessary
degree we have been profligate
with our guarantees. We have
given the impression to the world
that they are to be regarded as
something we are seeking rather
than as something that, carefully
and frugally, we occasionally give.

In our relations with the great
powers of Western Europe and
the Soviet Union, the firmest be
liever in quiet diplomacy will
agree that, following his meeting
with Mr. Macmillian, it would be
useful if the President had a
chance to talk face to face with
Gen. De Gaulle, with Dr. Ade
nauer, and with Mr. Khrushchev.
The real impartance of face to
face meetings with these men is
not that it is a substitute for quite
negotiation but that it facilitates
quiet negotiation. The heads of
government need to know what
kind of man their ambassadors
are telling them about. They need

and not only to try to imagine him

spared. It subjects him to a physi
cal and nervous strain which he
should not be asked to bear. It
downgrades the authority of the
American Ambassadors on the
spot, and of the roving ambassa
dor, Gov. Harriman, who may be
needed to represent the United
States to regional negotiations. It
sets a precedent. If the Secretary
must go to SEATO, then in no
time at all he will have to go to
the centers of all the other pacts—
to CENTO, to NATO, to OAS. He
must go also to th'.» neighboring
states whose prestige will be hurt
if he does not visit them. Before
he knows it, he will be visiting
Formosa and Japan and so on and
on.
THIS IS as good a time as any
to turn over a new leaf and to set
new precedents. The Philippines
and Thailand have ambassadors,
able ambassadors, in Washington.
Let them be asked to explain to
their governments why the Secre
tary of State cannot leave Wash
ington when a new Administra
tion is just forming. Let them be
told that the American Ambassa
dors in Bangkok and Manila will
have instructions backed by the
full authority of our government.
Moreover, let us begin to un
tangle the error of high policy,
which has been to treat pacts of
guarantee, like SEATO, as instru
ments which the United States is
trying to sell. The United States
guarantee has been tossed around
very loosely. To an unnecessary
degree we have been profligate
with our guarantees. We have
given the impression to the world
that they are to be regarded as
something we are seeking rather
than as something that, carefully
and frugally, we occasionally give.

In our relations with the great
powers of Western Europe and
the Soviet Union, the firmest be
liever in quiet diplomacy will
agree that, following his meeting
with Mr. Macmillian, it would be
useful if the President had a
chance to talk face to face with
Gen. De Gaulle, with Dr. Ade
nauer, and with Mr. Khrushchev.
The real impartance of face to
face meetings with these men is
not that it is a substitute for quite
negotiation but that it facilitates
quiet negotiation. The heads of
government need to know what
kind of man their ambassadors
are telling them about. They need
to see the man and to hear him,
and not only to try to imagine him
from photographs and cartoons.
But this act of getting acquaint
ed, which is desirable for the new
President, must resolutely be kept
from becoming inflated into sum
mitry. One precaution is to have
it understood that a formal sum
mit meeting is not now in pros
pect. Another precaution is for the
President to avoid travelling
abroad at least until he has fin
ished with his legislative pro
gram. including foreign aid and
defense. This would mean that at
least until next summer face to
face meetings would have to take
place in Washington or in New
York.
MR. KHRUSHCHEV has, it ap
pears, had explained to him the
reasons why the new Administra
tion needs time to form its policy
on the great issues. Time is needed
for study and for debate and for
decision. Time is needed also for
public education. It is not now
possible, for example, to have a
fruitful negotiation about arms
control or about new ways of
guaranteeing the freedom of the
people of West Berlin. In these
matters the air is still too full of
spooks.
If this is understood, it would
be an advantage if Mr. Khru
shchev could visit this country,
let us say in April after Mr. Mac
millan has been here. He might
come to the U.N. and on to Wash
ington. Mr. Khrushchev and Mr.
Kennedy had better get to know
one another since they will be
dealing with one another on such
critical questions. This will be a
demonstration that diplomatic in
tercourse has been restored after
the rupture of last May. If this
strengthens Mr. Khrushchev at
home and among his Communist
allies, we can count that as being
to the general advantage.
One of the prime lessons of the
Eisenhower-Khrushchev dealings
is, I believe, that personal sum
mitry cannot succeed unless in the
interval between the big meetings
there is persistent and imaginat
tive quiet diplomacy. The reason
for the disaster in May is to be
found, it seems to me, in the seven
months of diplomatic drifting and
inadvertence which took place
after Mr. Khrushchev's visit to
Washington.

Secretary Rusk is said to be
under considerable pressure to
cross the Pacific in order to at
tend a meeting of SEATO in
Eangkok. Two Asian members of
the South East Asia Treaty Or
ganiation, the Philippines and
Thailand, are dissatisfied, it would
appear, with the unwillingness of
Great Britain and France to hot
up the Loation trouble, and they
are threatening to withdraw from
SEATO. Only Secretary Rusk,
they say, can dissuade them, and
to do this he must go to Bangkok.
No one else can dissuade them.
Only the Secretary of State in per
son.
It will be a pity if so early in the

be lured back

and unprofitable
ways of itinerant
summitry. No
