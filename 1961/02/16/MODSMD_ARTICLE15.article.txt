Packard Comedian?
On Wednesday evening the stu
dents of Stanford had a rare op
portunity. In Memorial Audito
rium the Committee on Pub. Ex.
presented one of the foremost hu
morists of our time. Mr. Packard
is a master of humor by mis
quote—and in the use of fact out
of context in order to amuse (Let
it not be said that Stanford stu
dents are so gullible as to miss
lead by this—for surely the over
generalization is seen as pure hu
mor I. I wish to congratulate the
Pub. Ex. Com. on bringing this
later-day Mort Saul to campus.
Would the Chappie were as
funny.
R. R. ANDERSON
Desk Supported
I heartily commend the pioneer
effort of the African Desk on
their trip to the South and their
supplement to the Daily this Mon
day.
It is a shame that LASSU would
not cooperate with them. The
members of the Desk have nobly
undertaken the burden of $200 for
the printing of the supplement. I
think the student body can show
its appreciation by contributing,
and I enclose a small gift to help
pay for the African supplement.
DON LIGHT
HST Kidnap
We were so impressed by the
letters to the editor which ex
plained why Eichmann should be
kidnapped and tried in Israel that
we are willing to aid any Japanese
who wish to kidnap and try Harry
Truman in Japan for having or-!
dered the dropping of the A- :
bombs on Japanese civilians.
