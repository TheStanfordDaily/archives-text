## Frosh Basketball Team Schedules Baby Bears 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford's freshman basketball
; team goes after its 11th and 12th
wins of the season and its fourth
! and fifth in a row when it takes
| on the rugged California Baby
] Bears tomorrow and Saturday
night. Tomorrow's game is at
Stanford starting at 6 o'clock,
while the Saturday game is at
| Harmon Gym at California with
in Berkeley with the tip-off also
at 6 p.m.
CALIFORNIA has inflicted one
of Stanford's two defeats of the
1960-61 season, 64-57 at California.
California started fast, took a safe
half-time lead, and coasted to the
win.
Stanford will open with almost
the same starting lineup that
faced Cal the last game. Tom
I Dose starts at center. Dose, at
6-7'l>, is the big reason for Stan
ford's successful season. After hit
iting a mid-season slump, he has
come back strong to break the
! Stanford freshman scoring record
with a 3cS-point effort.
UK HAS scored 38> 11 and 26
I points in his last three games. He

0- - -
! had a bad night against Cal in
| their previous meeting, scoring
I only 7 points, but he fed off for
I several basket s despite close
' guarding.
At the forwards Hollis Moore
[and either Rich Gritschke or Bob
j Hollman are the starters. Moore
i has been a dependable scorer with
medium-range jump shots, and
has consistently rebounded and
defended well.
Gritschke had been the starter
all season, until he ran into a
case of the flu last week. Hollman
replaced him last weekend and
scored in the double figures both
games.
STANFORD'S guards are Lew
Shupe and Bob Ewing. Despite
their 5-9 and 5-10 height, they
have defended well against men
a full half a foot taller. Shupe is
always in the 8- to 10-point range.
Against this formidable array,
California will send a crew that
averages 6-5'2. Center Bob Wueste
is 6-8, forwards Ed Rucker and
Bill Wilson 6-7 and 6-6 1 - respec
tively, and guards Bruce Ballmer
6-2 and Dennv Lewis 5-11.
