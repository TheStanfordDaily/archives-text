# Cal Card Hoopers Vie This Weekend
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
The Stanford basktball team,
I fresh from a resounding 79-65 win
over the Bruins of UCLA, will be
out to complete a three-game
sweep over the California Bears
when the Tribe cagers take on the
wearers of the Blue and Gold in
a two-game set this weekend, first

I in the Pavilion on Friday and then
i in Harmon Gym at Berkeley on
Saturday.
In their first clash last Jan. 10
at Berkeley, the Indian hoopsters
ran up a 35-20 bulge at intermis
sion time and barely withstood a
second-half Bear surge to eke out
a narrow 53-52 victory.
SINCE THEN Cal has dropped
a decision to UCLA and two more
last weekend to the Washington
Huskies at Seattle which, added
to their earlier losses to USC (2>
and Stanford, gives the Berkeley -
ites a Big Five record of 0-6, good
for the cellar position.
On the basis of their preseason
mark of 8 wins and 2 losses
the Bears were co-favorites with
UCLA for the AAWU hoop crown.
Now it seems the Blue and Gold
will have to fight to stay out of
the bottom spot of the Big Five
standings.
Leading the California attempt
to break into the win column will
J be 6-5 senior Bill McClintock. Mc
j Clintock, a veteran of two NCAA
! basketball tournaments, was an
i all-AAWU choice and made hon
orable mention All-America.
THE BIG forward is a talented
rebounder and currently tops the
Big Five in that department with
67 of a possible 448 rebounds for

a .150 average. MeClintoek is also
the second Bear scorer, garnering
70 counters in six contests on 28
field goals and 14 free tosses for
an 11.7 points per game average.
The second of the Hear cage
pride and joys is guard Earl
Shultz. Shultz, like MeClintoek,
claimed honorable mention All-
America recognition as well as
All-AAWU honors last season.
Shultz, a 6-4 1 1 senior, is the key
stone in the Cal defense, presently
the second best in the Big Five,
allowing only 60 digits per con
test. The veteran performer has
settled down as a scorer 1 his
year and is the top Bear point
maker in league play, averaging
11.8 markers per game on 71
points in six contests.
STARTING at the post position
for the Bears is 0-7 Stan Morrison.
Morrison, a junior with one year's i
experience, has had the dubious:
distinction of following in the
wake of All-America Darrall Im
hoff, but has come along well
and is second best Cal rebounder.
Opening in the other forward
slot is 6-3 senior letterman Dave
Stafford, a good shot and re
bounder. Bobby Wendell, prcvi- j
ously the regular second guard, |
is currently riding the bench.
