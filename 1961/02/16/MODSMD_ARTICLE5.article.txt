# U.S. Skating Team Killed in Jet Crash; 55 Others Die

### 
BUSS ELS (UPI) â€” A Belgian
Sabena jot airliner roared in non
stop from New York yesterday,
made two faltering attempts to
land and nose-dived to earth on a
third try, exploding in flames and
killing 73 persons, including the
entire 18-member United States
figure-skating team.
The approach was so erratic
crash crews already had been
alerted.
The death toll of 61 passengers,
53 of them Americans, and 11
crewmen was the largest ever in
volving a single jet passenger

flight. It was the first major air
disaster of 1961 and the first in
volving a Boeing 707 jet in com
mercial service.
THE 73R1) victim was a one
time bicycle racer who was en
gulfed in flaming wreckage while
picking lettuce in a field.
The skating team, en route to
the world skating championships
in Prague, was led by lovely, 16-
year-old Laurence Owen who was
crowned a queen of the ice only
last Sunday and whose figure
graced the cover of Sports Illu
strated Magazine last week.
Capt. Louis Lambrechts, a war
time Belgian pilot in the British
Royal Air Force and a veteran of
the jet age, made two passes at
the field and had swung around
for a third when disaster struck.
LAMBRECHTS overshot the
three-mile long runway twice and

then as hi.s silver and blue plane
wheeled for another try it cart
wheeled into a perpendicular
bank and plunged straight down,
its landing gear extended.
The passengers, who only an
hour before had been sailing
above the clouds with a grand
stand seat for an eclipse of the
sun, died instantly.
La'mbrechts had lost radio con
tact with the control tower 15
minutes before. He had given no
evidence anything was wrong, but
the sounds of the engines and the
streams of smoke pouring from
the powerful jets brought vil
lagers out to watch death strike.
THEY SAW the plane burn with
a temperature estimated to have
reached 1,000 degrees centigrade,
high enough to boil the aluminum
shell of Ihe plane.
Dying with Laurence were 17
other members of the team, five
coaches, the team manager and
friends and relatives- a total of
34 in the party en route to
Prague. Their deaths plunged the
world of sport into grief and
ended for several years any
American hopes of Olympic skat
ing victories.
Laurence had just won the
North American figure skating
championship at Philadelphia.
Also killer! were her mother, Mrs.
Maribel Vinson Owen, herself nine
times national skating champion,
and her sister, Maribel. 20, who
won the U.S. Senior Champion
ship at Colorado Spring Jan. 27
with Dudley Richards, 28, who
also was killed.
