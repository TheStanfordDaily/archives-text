# Increase UN Power â€”Bunche
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, undersec
retary of the United Nations,
spoke out for more international
aid for underdeveloped countries,
more power for the United Na
tions, more preparation for coun
tries working for independence
and more respect for the dignity
of the African last night.
Bunche was the participant in
a panel discussion before a near
capacity audience in Memorial
Auditorium. President Wallace
Sterling was moderator of the
panel, part of the lIR Foreign
Policy Institute.
OTHER members of the panel
were Dr. Carl B. Spaeth, Dean of
the Stanford School of Law, Dr.
Leonard Marks, assistant dean of
the Graduate School of Business
and Dr. Martin Travis of the Po
litical Science Department.
Bunche said the U.N. now is
faced with the problem of
"whether the United Nations is
going to be a body which can op
erate as well as discuss.
"This problem is a basic factor
in the present ideological con
flict," Bunche continued. "The
majority of the member states
favor giving the United Nations
the power to take action. There
are others who want the United
Nations to discuss, but not to act,"
he explained.
THE AUDIENCE r e s p o nded
with applause when Bunche de
clared "Aid should be given inter
nationally because it is completely
free of suspicion that any strings
might be attached. In Africa the
attitude is almost unanimous in
favor of international aid over
national aid."
"The fundamental lesson to be
learned from the Congo is that
there must be earnest, intensive,
and accelerated preparation in a
country if there is going to be in
dependence," Bunche said.
Bunche cautioned against using
lack of preparedness as a tactic to
delay independence. "People will
always ask 'Are they ready for
independence?' The answer is al
ways no. Yet no nation was ever
ready for independence when they
got it."
