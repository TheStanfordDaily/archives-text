# Model U.S. Senate Rolling
## 
### BARRY GREENBERG 
The campus has been covered this week with
white and green posters which say nothing but
MUSS. What does it mean? MUSS stands for
Model United States Senate, a concept which hope
fully will become reality by fall quarter.
The Model United States Senate is a project
of the Political Union which is now working on
plans for the senate. Basically, MUSS will be an
institution just like the U.S. Senate. It will be
composed of 100 student senators who will debate,
hold committee meetings and pass legislation.
TIIIOKK WILL bo two senators from each state,
but students do not have to represent real senators.
For instance, one of the senators from Arizona
would not have to follow the path of Barry Gold
water. Student senators will also not be required
to vote or argue according to the way states now
vole or argue.
Also, legislation will be original. It is felt that
creating new legislation rather than debating and
voting upon current legislative bills before the
U.S. Senate will be of greater educational value.
AIJi STI DI NTS, regardless of major, are
eligible to be senators. The only requirement is a
desire to participate actively. Knowledge of debas

ing techniques or parliamentary procedure is not
essential. The rationale governing MUSS is that
il can serve as an important educational supple
ment just as does the Model United Nations.
Political Union hopes that once MUSS is estab
lished here, it can be instituted at other Western
universities as well.
The plan for the Model United States Senate is
in its forming stage. Much more "brainstorming"
is needed. One of the plans is to invite nationally
known people to Stanford to speak to the Model
United States Senate. President John F. Kennedy
will be invited.
MUSS IS AN ambitious and exciting movement
and its success depends on the students. A similar
organization was formed at Pr inceton several years
ago and according to Dr. John Bunzel, associate
professor of political science, who was at Princeton
at the time, it was moderately successful. Prince
ton's biggest problem was finding enough students.
The senate started out with approximately 10
senators and slowly built up to the required
number.
Interested students should either call or go to
I he Political Union office located in the Union and
should leave their names, addresses and phone
numbers.

creating new legislation rather than debating and
voting upon current legislative bills before the
U.S. Senate will be of greater educational value.
AIJi STI DI NTS, regardless of major, are
eligible to be senators. The only requirement is a
desire to participate actively. Knowledge of debas

ing techniques or parliamentary procedure is not
essential. The rationale governing MUSS is that
il can serve as an important educational supple
ment just as does the Model United Nations.
Political Union hopes that once MUSS is estab
lished here, it can be instituted at other Western
universities as well.
The plan for the Model United States Senate is
in its forming stage. Much more "brainstorming"
is needed. One of the plans is to invite nationally
known people to Stanford to speak to the Model
United States Senate. President John F. Kennedy
will be invited.
MUSS IS AN ambitious and exciting movement
and its success depends on the students. A similar
organization was formed at Pr inceton several years
ago and according to Dr. John Bunzel, associate
professor of political science, who was at Princeton
at the time, it was moderately successful. Prince
ton's biggest problem was finding enough students.
The senate started out with approximately 10
senators and slowly built up to the required
number.
Interested students should either call or go to
I he Political Union office located in the Union and
should leave their names, addresses and phone
numbers.
The campus has been covered this week with
white and green posters which say nothing but
MUSS. What does it mean? MUSS stands for
Model United States Senate, a concept which hope
fully will become reality by fall quarter.
The Model United States Senate is a project
of the Political Union which is now working on
plans for the senate. Basically, MUSS will be an
institution just like the U.S. Senate. It will be
composed of 100 student senators who will debate,
hold committee meetings and pass legislation.
TIIIOKK WILL bo two senators from each state,
but students do not have to represent real senators.
For instance, one of the senators from Arizona
would not have to follow the path of Barry Gold
water. Student senators will also not be required
to vote or argue according to the way states now
vole or argue.
Also, legislation will be original. It is felt that
creating new legislation rather than debating and
voting upon current legislative bills before the
U.S. Senate will be of greater educational value.
