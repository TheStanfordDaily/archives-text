# U.S. Should Aid Africa Through UN
## 
### 
In his two talks Wednesday, United Nations Undersecretary
Dr. Ralph Bunche, like most diplomats, had little new to say —at
least for public consumption.
However, his belief that "aid should be given internationally
because it is completely free of suspicion that any strings might
be attached," is worth re-emphasis.
This is especially true when we consider the failures of our own
foreign aid program in the new countries of Africa and Asia. To
many nations our aid has simply been the payment for an Air Force
base. Other foreign nationalists have found their own ambitions
thwarted by United States aid and so have criticized the United
States. As British Foreign Secretary Lord Home has said, "Those
who accuse the Americans of being warlike are those who find
the Americans champions of liberty standing astride their path of
ambition."
Let us then remove all taint of strings-attached aid. Let us also
take away the target for the demagogues of these new African
nations.
We can do this by giving aid internationally through the
United Nations. While we would have less control of our money,
since we have only one vote out of many in the Security Council,
the aid would be well-administered by international civil servants
of the caliber and dedication of Dr. Bunche and Mr. Hammarskjold.
In addition the United Nations would become strengthened as an
active, potent force in the keeping of world peace.
But more important to the interests of the United States, these
new African nations, while they might not become pro-Western at
the outset, would be kept out of the Soviet sphere of control. We
would not be looked upon as giving gifts with strings attached.
And the Lumumba-like demagogues would find no fuel for their
tirades.
With these many advantages we hope the foreign affairs com
mittee of both the House and the Senate will take a close look at
a program of internationally administered aid for the new nations
of Africa and Asia. We think the benefits might outweigh the
current low returns we are getting for our foreign aid dollar.
