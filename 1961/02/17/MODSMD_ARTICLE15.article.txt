One day an acorn fell on the head of Henny Penny. And off she
went rushing to tell Cocky Locky, Goosey Lucy and Turkey Lur
key, "The sky is falling! We must rush and tell the king!"
Henny Penny would feel right at home in Washington these
days. Just about everybody seems to be rushing about telling us
that the sky is falling. And that desperation measures are needed
to prop it up.
We haven't tried to keep track of all of them but you can almost
name your subject and you will find that somebody is telling
President Kennedy that if the Government doesn't immediately
whip up a big program and spend hundreds of millions of dollars
—or maybe billions—the western world will go Communistic, our
defense program will collapse in feebleness, children will grow
up in ignorance, old people will die of neglect, industry will stag
nate and we will plunge into a great depression.
Now, it would be a foolish man who pretended all's well with
the world. You need only to read the headlines about Laos or
Cuba or Africa to realize we are still beleaguered in the cold war.
And obviously there is much yet for America to do in improving
education and medical care. And the stockholder who has seen
his dividends cut back or the worker who has found his hours
reduced is well aware that business isn't as booming as it was.
But the burden of these outcries in Washington is not just that
of aspirations unfulfilled or mishaps encountered; the smallest acorn
is a major disaster.
Take these reports on the state of the economy. The operating
rates of some major industries are below their peaks. Unemploy
ment, particularly in a few areas, is up. The stock market has
receded from its record highs. And so on.
All this has been duly noted in the reports to President Ken
nedy. But most of these reports have been so busy crying alarm
they hardly had time to glance at other things. The steel industry,
for example, may be operating at a reduced capacity, but it is still
producing more steel than it was doing only a few years ago. In
autos, in housing and in many other areas the "recession" is not
only from very high levels of business but not very far down from
these peaks. And as a matter of fact, consumer spending in 1960
was at the highs.
The difficulty with mistaking fallen acorns for toppling roofs is
that it leads to panicky courses. Thus most of the economic reports
to the President plunge quickly into recommendations for vast pro
grams of emergency tax cuts, billions of more spending and total
mobilization of Government planning, which is about like curing a
hangnail with an amputation.
The economic area, of course, is not the only one where we
can be lead astray by the propensity—we are almost inclined to
say, our national proclivity—for treating every mishap as a dis
aster. This propensity is reflected almost any time there is a com
mittee report on anything, from foreign policy to education. It isn't
enough just to say that the sky is overcast and that it's raining.
It has to be pictured as a cloudburst.
Of course in the case of Henny Penny, she rushed off in such
a dither to find a short-cut that she wandered into the woods and
was never heard of again. Which always struck us as rather lucky
for both the king and the kingdom.

One day an acorn fell on the head of Henny Penny. And off she
went rushing to tell Cocky Locky, Goosey Lucy and Turkey Lur
key, "The sky is falling! We must rush and tell the king!"
Henny Penny would feel right at home in Washington these
days. Just about everybody seems to be rushing about telling us
that the sky is falling. And that desperation measures are needed
to prop it up.
We haven't tried to keep track of all of them but you can almost
name your subject and you will find that somebody is telling
President Kennedy that if the Government doesn't immediately
whip up a big program and spend hundreds of millions of dollars
—or maybe billions—the western world will go Communistic, our
defense program will collapse in feebleness, children will grow
up in ignorance, old people will die of neglect, industry will stag
nate and we will plunge into a great depression.
Now, it would be a foolish man who pretended all's well with
the world. You need only to read the headlines about Laos or
Cuba or Africa to realize we are still beleaguered in the cold war.
And obviously there is much yet for America to do in improving
education and medical care. And the stockholder who has seen
his dividends cut back or the worker who has found his hours
reduced is well aware that business isn't as booming as it was.
But the burden of these outcries in Washington is not just that
of aspirations unfulfilled or mishaps encountered; the smallest acorn
is a major disaster.
Take these reports on the state of the economy. The operating
rates of some major industries are below their peaks. Unemploy
ment, particularly in a few areas, is up. The stock market has
receded from its record highs. And so on.
All this has been duly noted in the reports to President Ken
nedy. But most of these reports have been so busy crying alarm
they hardly had time to glance at other things. The steel industry,
for example, may be operating at a reduced capacity, but it is still
producing more steel than it was doing only a few years ago. In
autos, in housing and in many other areas the "recession" is not
only from very high levels of business but not very far down from
these peaks. And as a matter of fact, consumer spending in 1960
was at the highs.
The difficulty with mistaking fallen acorns for toppling roofs is
that it leads to panicky courses. Thus most of the economic reports
to the President plunge quickly into recommendations for vast pro
grams of emergency tax cuts, billions of more spending and total
mobilization of Government planning, which is about like curing a
hangnail with an amputation.
The economic area, of course, is not the only one where we
can be lead astray by the propensity—we are almost inclined to
say, our national proclivity—for treating every mishap as a dis
aster. This propensity is reflected almost any time there is a com
mittee report on anything, from foreign policy to education. It isn't
enough just to say that the sky is overcast and that it's raining.
It has to be pictured as a cloudburst.
Of course in the case of Henny Penny, she rushed off in such
a dither to find a short-cut that she wandered into the woods and
was never heard of again. Which always struck us as rather lucky
for both the king and the kingdom.
