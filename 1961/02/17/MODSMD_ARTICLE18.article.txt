## U.N.'s Moderate Stand Fails To Pacify Congo Right, Left 
### 
In the Congo, the U.N. and the
U.S.A. now find themselves in the
middle. They have tried and failed
to pacify the irreconcilables on
the Left and on the Right. On the
Left are the Lumumbists in Ori
ental Province, now led by an au
thentic Communist, Gizenga, and
openly supported by the U.S.S.R.
On the Right is the province of
Katanga led by Tshombe, and sup
ported by Belgium.

The two war
ring extremes
have sever a 1
things in com
mon. Both are
opposed to the
U.N. and both
arc demanding
that the U.N.
troops be with
drawn. They
' want a clearfield

to fight their civil war. Both are
opposed to conciliation and each
believes in a civil war it has the
most to gain. Both hate the peace
makers. Presumably the Left be
lieves that with I he help of the
U.S.S.R. and of the United Arab
Republic and the other Casablan
ca nations it can conquer the
whole Congo. Presumably the
Right believes that with Belgian
support it can at least hold the
rich and crucial province of Ka
tanga, and in the course of time
draw the West, including the
United States, into more and more
active support of its cause.
THE GRIM fact is that among
the Congolese factions which have
arms and some authority there is
none that looks to the U.N. for a
solution. This is true of the Com
munist Gizenga in Stanleyville, of
the Belgian Tshombe in Elizabeth
ville. and of our somnolent Kasa
vubu in Leopoldville.
There is indeed reason to sus
pect, in view of the sequence of
events, that the murder of Lu
mumba was perpetrated when it
began to appear that the Western
powers were agreed 011 proposals
for the pacification of the Congo
including the release of Lumumba.
The men who murdered him
wanted not only to do away with
Lumumba, whose hold on the
masses was growing while he was
in prison. They wanted to estab
lish the idea that the only way to
deal with the Congo is to fight
out the civil war.
AS AGAINST this, there is the
fact that a collapse into interna
tional civil war in the Congo will
involve most of Africa in the cold
war. If that happens, it will be a
lethal blow to the hopes of the
new African states for peaceable
development.
Even if these states are not in
volved in the fighting, the big
powers both East and West will
have little time, energy, or money
for assisting their development
For this reason the vital interest
of the new African -states lies in
preserving the United Nations.
OUR ItKST hope in Africa i.«
staked on this also. For many
reasons including our own Negrr
problem at home, the United
States can make no military inter
vention in Africa without pushing
popular sentiment towards thr
Soviet Union. Only if our actions
in Africa are not military, art

technical and humanitarian, can
we expect our influence to be ac
cepted.
The hold spirits among us who
think otherwise, and would like
us to intervene in the primitive
states of Africa, will have to learn
that Rudyard Kipling and Queen
Victoria are dead, besides which
they were not Americans.
