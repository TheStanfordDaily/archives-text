# British-Scientist Cites Danger If Russia Misuses Solar Rays

### 
LONDON (UPI) — A British
space scientist said yesterday tho
Russians have taken the first step
toward orbiting giant reflectors
capable of concentrating the sun's
cosmic rays on an earthly target
and burning man and matter to a
crisp.
But L. J. Carter, Secretary of
the British Interplanetary Society,
estimated that it would take at
least 15 years before such a fear
some space weapon could be per
fected.
C ARTER WAS commenting on
a statement by Soviet scientist An
Sternfeld lhat recent Russian
space successes proved "beyond

the shadow of doubt" that it now
is possible to place huge space
platforms into orbit.
Sternfeld said this had been
demonstrated by the successful
launching of the 7.1-ton Sputnik
on Feb. 4 and the piggy-back
rocket that hurled tlie Soviet
spaceship toward Venus.
"It's a certainty that the Rus
sians are now thinking about us
ing such a space platform as the
base for a large saucer-shaped
lens or mirror to reflect the sun's
rays to earth," Carter said.
"THIS IS VERY theoretical now
but will first be seen in a modified
form of weather control."
