There won't he any champion
ships decided in Stanford's basket
ball series this weekend but that
won't lessen iho excitement nor
deter some 10.000 fans who will
fill the Pavilion tonight and Har
mon Gym al Berkeley tomorrow
as t hi' ,high flying Indians meet
the AAWU cellar dwelling Cali
fornia Bears.
Stanford pulled out a win in the
two teams' previous encounter
this season and repeats this week
end would establish the local five
as a strong contender for the sec
ond spot in Big Five play.
COACH Howie Dallmar's Stan
ford crew almost upset league
leading IJSC last Friday, getting
edged 63-57,and then they knocked

Friday night between halves
of the varsity basketball game
with ( al. the Stanford yell
leaders will take oil the Bear
yell leader quintet.
Stanford's squad consists
of Tim "Lighti'ingers" Lad
dish, Gorgeous George Tson
gas, Gregarious Gregg Hop
kins, Dirty Dave Kiesel, and
Torrid Terry Foreman.
The Stanford yell leaders
dumped the Cal cheering
squad last year by a 2-0 count
in a hard-fought duel.

off runnerup UCLA, 79-6.1, the
following: night lo move into a
third place lie with the Bruins.
Both squads are 3-3.
Cal, on the other hand, has only
six league games left, including
the Stanford affairs, and since the
Bears are currently 0-6 the once
proud Berkeleyites will have to
win all of their remaining games
in order just to break even.
Adding value to the spectator
dollar are two frays between the
evenly matched Baby Bear and
Papoose quintets beginning at
6:00 before each varsity contest.
Til 10 BliUlO and Gold frosh
downed the Farm yearlings, 64-
57, earlier this year but Stanford
frosh pivot man Tom Dose has
since hit his stride and has scored
78 points in his last three outings,
leading the locals to three straight
wins.
For the Stanford varsity, vet
eran forwards John Windsor and
John Hendry will provide the fire
power. Windsor tossed 30 points
through the nets against UCLA
and moved into fourth place in the |
league scoring race with 84 points
in six outings and a 34 counter
per-game average.
Hendry, the jumping jack, six
font three-incher, is right behind
Windsor with 77 points in half a
dozen frays for a 12.8 average.
Center Mike Led leads

Stanford rebounders with 47
grabs out of a total of 469 lose
balls and a .010 percentage.
SENIOR Bub Bowling and Don
Clemetson round out the local's
starting five, both cagers opening
at the guard positions.
Top scorer for the East Bay
men is 6-4 guard Earl Shultz who

was well known for his defensive
talents last season. He since has
developed a fine shooting touch
and is currently averaging 11.8
counters per fray.
Heralded for All-American hon
ors is senior Bill McClintock. He
is living up to at least part of the
ballyhoo by leading the Big Five
in rebounding, having pulled 67
off the boards.
Bill, a muscular 6-4, 210 pounds,
uses his heft to advantage around
the basket, scoring on tips and
short shots. At the moment he is
the second best Cal pointmaker,
totaling just one less counter than
Shultz in league play.
