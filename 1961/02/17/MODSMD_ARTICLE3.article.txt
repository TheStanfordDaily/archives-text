# Legislature Okays IIR Supplement
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
lIR will bo allowed to use $200
j of its funds to pay The Daily for
; the African Desk •supplement
! printed in the paper last Monday,
j Legislature decided by an 11-7
: vote in a marathon, 3-hour, 15-
minute meeting last night.
LASSU approved the use of the
money, to be drawn from the
j $300 Averell Harriman returned
j to the lIR last year, after lengthy
debate.
AT ITS meeting last week, the
group had refused llR's request
to use the Harriman money. But
lIR guaranteed The Daily pay-
I ment—even if lIR had to dip into
I their own wallets to pay for the
: supplement—and the supplement
j came out Monday.
i Bill Sterling, lIR president, told
LASSU that lIR was at fault for
1 not explaining the purpose of the
i supplement last week, and asked
the group to reconsider and give
lIR the money.
HAN SYYYTER, assistant finan
cial manager, charged that lIR
members "had no real honest in
tent" to pay the money out of
their own pockets if LASSU re
fused to give them the $200 last
night. He said lIR had wanted to
put LASSU "over a barrel" by
publishing the supplement and
then asking for the money.
But many LASSU members held
that the supplement was valuable
to the campus and to lIR and
that lIR had every right to use
its own money to pay for it.
IN OTHER action. LASSU de
bated proposed amendments to
the Political Union part of the
ASSU constitution for an hour
and ten minutes, made three
amendments to the amendments,
and then rejected the proposed
changes for lack of a three
fourths affirmative vote.
It also changed the ASSU by
laws to provide for an elected
representative from the humani
ties graduate students and one
from the mineral sciences or sci
ences.
