# Very unusual
## 
### 
Tory ITA is the first of a series of test reactors
being developed under the Lawrence Radiation
Laboratory's nuclear ramjet program.
A reactor for ramjet propulsion must operate
at high power levels yet be of minimum si/o
and mass. Its design must consider the very high
pressure drop across its length, the stress loads
due to flight maneuvering, and the extremely

high radiation flux level which itself leads to
severe heat transfer and radiation damage prob
lems. Because (he operating temperature exceeds
that at which most conventional structural ma
terials fail, the core itself consists of bundled
tubes of sintered uranium and beryllium oxide
fabricated with central holes for continuous air
passage.

One of many unusual projects at the
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory â€” the only
national laboratory active in virtually all
phases of the atomic energy program.
ON FEBRUARY 24
Lawrence Radiation Laboratory staff members
will be on campus to answer your questions
about a career in nuclear research.
They will interview outstanding:
electronic engineers
physicists
mathematicians
mechanical engineers (MS, Ph 1))
Call your placement office for an appointment.
