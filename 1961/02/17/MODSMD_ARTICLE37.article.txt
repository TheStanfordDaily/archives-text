# Strengthened UN Demanded

### 
WASHINGTON (UPI > â€” Two
1960 Senale delegates to the
United Nations said yesterday the
world organization should be
"strengthened and continued" de
spite its "doubtful" Congo effort
and tho possible early seating of
Red China.
They said in a 28-page report
that 1960 may mark a "turning
point" for the United Nations and
for U.S. participation in it. The
United Nations "faces a financial
crisis in the Congo alone" because
Russia and its satellites have re
fused to share that cost while
sending Communist "trouble-
J makers" into Ihe divided African
country, they said.
Sens. George D. Aiken, R-Vt.,
and Wayne Morse, D-Ore., empha
sized that U.S. policy must be
based upon the assumption that
Communist China could be seated
in the United Nations as early as
next fall "whether we agree or
I not."
