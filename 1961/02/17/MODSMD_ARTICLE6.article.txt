## 
### FRANCES FISHER 
The urgent need for realism in
American foreign policy was
stressed last night by William
Mandel during a question and an
swer session on the Soviet Union.
Mandel. an author, lecturer and
radio commentator who has lived
in the U.S.S..R. in 1931 and 1959,
sprinkled his answers to students'
questions with his personal ex
periences during his visits in the
U.S.S.R.
ASKKI) IF he felt that Ameri
can government policy would
change much with the new ad
ministration, Mandel answered
"Kennedy is a politician who acts
according to problems as they
arise he will not make any seri
ous changes in foreign policy, al
though change is long overdue."
Taking a stand on the current
UN controversy, Mandel asserted
his agreement with Russia's de
sire to set up a three-member So
viet-type presidium to replace the
secretarial generalship now held
by Dag Hammarskjold.
He slated that when Khrush
chev asked for the abandonment
of the secretary generalship, 'ho

was recognizing the need for
change that must come sooner or
later; he was recognizing the fact
that three forces exist the Unit
ed States, the Soviet Union, and
the dominant force the neulrals."
MAN DM, said further that if
the U.S. continues to insist on its

present policy, it will find 1) that
China will go into the U.N. de
spite our opposition and 2) that
the U.S. will have to use its veto
power as Russia has had to use
.it in the past.
Concerning conditions in Rus
sia today, Mandel emphasized the
support which the people give
their government, the trend to
ward greater freedom, and the
people's abhorrence for war "an
abhorrance of which we cannot
possibly conceive since we have
not experienced the kind of trag
edy the Russians experienced dur
ing World War 11.
"THE RUSSIANS claim that
nobody goes to jail for political
convictions, a statement which I
feel is 99 per cent true" Mandel
said, emphasizing the freedom of
thought allowed in Russia.
On the issue of disarmament
Mandel stated that the Russian
people are overwhelmingly in fa
vor of the proposals offered by
their own country. "The reason is
the United States' proposals won't
stand up because our government
is scared of the economic results
of disarmament."
