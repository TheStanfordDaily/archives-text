# Ram's Head to Open Winter Plays Tonight
## 
### SONYA MICHEL 
Winter One-Acts went into final dress rehearsal last night in
preparation for the opening tonight at 8:IS in Memorial Audi
torium.
There was more excitement than usual over the Ram's Head
production which Paul Landry, technical director of the Speech

I — 7
and Drama Department, has
termed "the most complex show
ever presented in the Little The
ater."
Three never-before produced,
student-written plays make up
the program. They are staged in
I tire three-quarter round, with spe
i cial sets and lighting.
THE SETTINGS for the three
plays vary widely in time and
location. "White Mountain Lau
rel," by James D. Lyon, takes
place in the Ozarks during the
Civil War.
Dave Kirk's "When in Rome"
goes back to that city in ancient
times, while Pauline Peotter's
The Leash" is set in modern New
York City. Miss Peotter is also
the director of "White Mountain
Laurel."
James Lyon designed a multi
ple set for his play. Intricate light
ing illuminates one area of the
stage at a time, so that three dif
ferent scenes are combined in
one.
ROBERT Murry is directing
Fred Watkins, Barbara Stevens,
and Dave Kirk in "The Leash."
This stark drama investigates the
j problems of a young man in con-
I temporary society, and their ef
fect on those who love him.
Exaggerated pink marble col
umns set the stage for "When in
Rome," a "comedy of manners."
Judy Shrader is the director of
this classical farce spiced with
modern terminology.
Ben Whitney is producer for
! a 11 three plavs, assisted by Sue j
1 Davidson and David Packard, j
i Judy Levin is acting as assistant
to the directors.
AMONG the problems of Dick'
| Prael, technical director, was the)
I care and feeding of a nameless!
| male cat. one of the principles in
: "The Leash." The rambunctious
feline resisted doses of tranquil
lizers and continually tried to
steal the rehearsal stage.
