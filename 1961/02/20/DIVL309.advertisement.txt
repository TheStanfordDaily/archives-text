NEW AUTO INSURANCE
SAVINGS ANNOUNCED
Savings up to $120 on automobile
insurance are now common for mar
ried men under 25 years of age
with the California Casualty In
demnity Exchange.
j "Married men in this age bracket
are generally paying excessive pre
miums for the degree of risk in
volved," says George M. Campbell, |
Campus Representative for the Ex- |
change.
"We believe that a married man
with family responsibilities is a
more careful driver, and causes
fewer accidents," said Campbell,
j "Therefore, he is entitled to rates
for mature drivers."
I For example: A married man, ago 1
22 with Bodily Injury Liability
j $10/20,000, Property Damage
$5,000 and Medical $500 pays
about $157 a year with most in
; surance companies. With Califor- j
nia Casualty he would pay about
$80 less $16 dividend, or a net of
$64 (based on current 20 per cent
dividend). Thus he saves about
$93 with the Exchange. (Other
coveraqes with comparable sav
! 'rigs).
Campbell declared that even un- |
married men and women with good
driving records may save over 20 j
per cent.
