# A 						'COINCIDENCE OF ERRORS'
## Facts Behind Encina Food Poisoning Scare 
### ROSS HERMANN Night Managing Editor 
(Niglit Managing Editor Ross Hermann
lias spent hours interviewing persons con
cerned with the food poisoning episode in an
attempt to find out what really happened be
hind the scenes. Here is his story as it pieces
together from various accounts.)
Corrective measures have been under
taken to prevent a repeat of the confusion
and panic that resulted three weeks ago when
nearly 100 Encina diners were stricken with
mild food poisoning, Dr. George Houck. direc
tor of the Health Service, and Frederic
Glover, executive assistant to the president,
revealed yesterday.
Administration officials described the
events of the evening as a "coincidence of
errors" arising out of the unfamiliarity of
several persons with emergency procedure
and difficulties in communication.
STRANGELY ENOUGH, it was the cor
rect medical judgment of the doctor on duty
at the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital that com
bined with the unfamiliarity of two resident
assistants with emergency procedure and the
negligence of a new switchboard operator at
the hospital to cause a three-hour delay in
medical attention and thereby a state of
panic among stricken graduate students at
Crothers.
As the incidents of the evening shape up,
it seems that the first food poisoning cases
were from Stanford Village and Crothers and

came personally to the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital about 8:30 p.m. The doctor on duty
diagnosed these cases and determined them
immediately to bo of a mild variety and not
serious.
Shortly after, a call was received at the
hospital from an R.A, in Crothers who im
ported several more eases. The doctor on
duty, having already treated several food
poisoning patients, told them that the out
break of food poisoning was not serious and
gave instructions for simple treatment. On
the basis of his medical judgment, he did not
consider the matter a dire emergency.
ACCORDING TO Phil Maroot, president
of Crothers Hall, 20 more students had fallen
ill by 9:30. By 10 p.m. 30 more were stricken.
Again the doctor was phoned, and he gave
the same instructions. After the fifth call,
according to Maroot, with 80 students ill by
this time, the doctor agreed to send help. Aid
did not come immediately, however, as large
amounts of medicine had to be prepared.
With the frustration of the attempts to
get hell) and with more and more students
pouring into the RA.'s rooms with com
plaints. confusion began to mount.
ABOUT II P.M. when medical attention
was not forthcoming from the hospital, an
RA. in Crothers tried to reach Houck
through the switchboard at the Palo Alto
Clinic, and the operator who was new on the
job refused to put through the call because
it was liouck's day off. Shortly afterwards,

Houck was called at his home. Roused out
of his sleep, he promised to send help immedi
ately and proceeded by alerting Dr. John
Eckert, associate director of the Health Serv
ice, and Dr. John Osborn.
According to Maroot, Houck refused to
call another doctor or appear personally.
Houck has flatly denied this accusation.
After contacting Eckert and Osborn,
Houck remained at his home and directed the
matter by phone, contacting the public health
officer and the News and Publications Office,
as he is required to do in such a situation.
AFTER TALKING to Houck, the frantic
R.A. proceeded to call various administration
officials who happened to be out of town at
a conference. He finally reached Vice Provost
Robert Wert, who promised to get some
action.
Shortly after this call at about 11:30 or
•so, the doctor arrived from the hospital with
the medicine and was already there when
Eckert and Osborn arrived. Once the doctors
began their work the situation was quickly
brought under control, and things were
nearly back to normal when Wert made a
tour of Crothers after midnight.
Despite the delays, at no time during the
evening were the stricken students in any
actual danger, because the doctor on duty at
the hospital had diagnosed early cases cor
rectly and knew from these that the out
break was not serious. His chief mistake was
that he did not realize the psychological ef

fecty of such a mass outbreak, however mild,
or anticipate the panic it might cause.
ALTHOUGH MEDICALLY competent in
his diagnosis, the doctor at the hospital made
two mistakes which account for the greater
part of the delay. According to Houck, the
doctor was so busy on the medical side that
he neglected public relations. His second mis
take was that he did not inform his associates
who could have given him assistance. Out of
a sense of duty, according to Houck, this doc
tor thought ho could and should do the whole
job himself without bothering his colleagues.
As a result of these mistakes, all health
service and hospital doctors have been in
structed to call for assistance when they fall
behind in cases of mass treatment.
BLAME FOR THE delay must also be
given to the two Crothers R.A.'s who were
not familiar with emergency procedure. As
a result, R.A.'s have been reinstructed to
phone Houck immediately in such emergen
cies and if he is not available to phone Eckert
and Osborn.
Switchboard operators at the Palo Alto
Clinic also have been instructed to put
through calls at any time to Houck, Eckert
and Osborn. According to Houck, medical at
tention would have arrived sooner that night
if the operator had not refused to put through
the call to him from Crothers.
Cause of the food poisoning which struck
many residents in Crothers, Crothers Me
morial, Stanford Village, and The Oaks (grad

women's house) has not been determined.
University Health Officer Hal W. Wilson said
that a chemical analysis of samples of food
served at Encina that night produced nega
tive results.
WILSON ADDED that the cause of the
trouble will "probably never be known" and
that cards are being processed by an IBM
machine to determine the "most probable
suspect."
The food poisoning that hit 27 women in
Durand House the week before has been
traced to the organism Clostridium pcrfrin*
gens which gained a foothold in the short
ribs because of improper refrigeration and
the fact that food was cooked Friday night
for consumption Saturday night. In this case,
Houck noted, medical treatment was handled
perfect ly.
IN NEITHER CASE, according to Wilson,
was the commissary from which Stanford
dining halls obtain their food at fault. Also,
food handling techniques at Encina con
formed perfectly to public health standards,
Wilson reports.
To avoid similar situations in the future,
Wilson said, food service employees will be
required to take a four-hour course in food
serving. At the beginning of each quarter,
new hashers will be required to take a one
hour course.
In tomorrow's edition, The Daily will ex
amine the inadequacies of the present health
service facilities and the need for a new in
firmary.

job himself without bothering his colleagues.
As a result of these mistakes, all health
service and hospital doctors have been in
structed to call for assistance when they fall
behind in cases of mass treatment.
BLAME FOR THE delay must also be
given to the two Crothers R.A.'s who were
not familiar with emergency procedure. As
a result, R.A.'s have been reinstructed to
phone Houck immediately in such emergen
cies and if he is not available to phone Eckert
and Osborn.
Switchboard operators at the Palo Alto
Clinic also have been instructed to put
through calls at any time to Houck, Eckert
and Osborn. According to Houck, medical at
tention would have arrived sooner that night
if the operator had not refused to put through
the call to him from Crothers.
Cause of the food poisoning which struck
many residents in Crothers, Crothers Me
morial, Stanford Village, and The Oaks (grad

women's house) has not been determined.
University Health Officer Hal W. Wilson said
that a chemical analysis of samples of food
served at Encina that night produced nega
tive results.
WILSON ADDED that the cause of the
trouble will "probably never be known" and
that cards are being processed by an IBM
machine to determine the "most probable
suspect."
The food poisoning that hit 27 women in
Durand House the week before has been
traced to the organism Clostridium pcrfrin*
gens which gained a foothold in the short
ribs because of improper refrigeration and
the fact that food was cooked Friday night
for consumption Saturday night. In this case,
Houck noted, medical treatment was handled
perfect ly.
IN NEITHER CASE, according to Wilson,
was the commissary from which Stanford
dining halls obtain their food at fault. Also,
food handling techniques at Encina con
formed perfectly to public health standards,
Wilson reports.
To avoid similar situations in the future,
Wilson said, food service employees will be
required to take a four-hour course in food
serving. At the beginning of each quarter,
new hashers will be required to take a one
hour course.
In tomorrow's edition, The Daily will ex
amine the inadequacies of the present health
service facilities and the need for a new in
firmary.
(Niglit Managing Editor Ross Hermann
lias spent hours interviewing persons con
cerned with the food poisoning episode in an
attempt to find out what really happened be
hind the scenes. Here is his story as it pieces
together from various accounts.)
Corrective measures have been under
taken to prevent a repeat of the confusion
and panic that resulted three weeks ago when
nearly 100 Encina diners were stricken with
mild food poisoning, Dr. George Houck. direc
tor of the Health Service, and Frederic
Glover, executive assistant to the president,
revealed yesterday.
Administration officials described the
events of the evening as a "coincidence of
errors" arising out of the unfamiliarity of
several persons with emergency procedure
and difficulties in communication.
STRANGELY ENOUGH, it was the cor
rect medical judgment of the doctor on duty
at the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital that com
bined with the unfamiliarity of two resident
assistants with emergency procedure and the
negligence of a new switchboard operator at
the hospital to cause a three-hour delay in
medical attention and thereby a state of
panic among stricken graduate students at
Crothers.
As the incidents of the evening shape up,
it seems that the first food poisoning cases
were from Stanford Village and Crothers and

came personally to the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital about 8:30 p.m. The doctor on duty
diagnosed these cases and determined them
immediately to bo of a mild variety and not
serious.
Shortly after, a call was received at the
hospital from an R.A, in Crothers who im
ported several more eases. The doctor on
duty, having already treated several food
poisoning patients, told them that the out
break of food poisoning was not serious and
gave instructions for simple treatment. On
the basis of his medical judgment, he did not
consider the matter a dire emergency.
ACCORDING TO Phil Maroot, president
of Crothers Hall, 20 more students had fallen
ill by 9:30. By 10 p.m. 30 more were stricken.
Again the doctor was phoned, and he gave
the same instructions. After the fifth call,
according to Maroot, with 80 students ill by
this time, the doctor agreed to send help. Aid
did not come immediately, however, as large
amounts of medicine had to be prepared.
With the frustration of the attempts to
get hell) and with more and more students
pouring into the RA.'s rooms with com
plaints. confusion began to mount.
ABOUT II P.M. when medical attention
was not forthcoming from the hospital, an
RA. in Crothers tried to reach Houck
through the switchboard at the Palo Alto
Clinic, and the operator who was new on the
job refused to put through the call because
it was liouck's day off. Shortly afterwards,

Houck was called at his home. Roused out
of his sleep, he promised to send help immedi
ately and proceeded by alerting Dr. John
Eckert, associate director of the Health Serv
ice, and Dr. John Osborn.
According to Maroot, Houck refused to
call another doctor or appear personally.
Houck has flatly denied this accusation.
After contacting Eckert and Osborn,
Houck remained at his home and directed the
matter by phone, contacting the public health
officer and the News and Publications Office,
as he is required to do in such a situation.
AFTER TALKING to Houck, the frantic
R.A. proceeded to call various administration
officials who happened to be out of town at
a conference. He finally reached Vice Provost
Robert Wert, who promised to get some
action.
Shortly after this call at about 11:30 or
•so, the doctor arrived from the hospital with
the medicine and was already there when
Eckert and Osborn arrived. Once the doctors
began their work the situation was quickly
brought under control, and things were
nearly back to normal when Wert made a
tour of Crothers after midnight.
Despite the delays, at no time during the
evening were the stricken students in any
actual danger, because the doctor on duty at
the hospital had diagnosed early cases cor
rectly and knew from these that the out
break was not serious. His chief mistake was
that he did not realize the psychological ef

fecty of such a mass outbreak, however mild,
or anticipate the panic it might cause.
ALTHOUGH MEDICALLY competent in
his diagnosis, the doctor at the hospital made
two mistakes which account for the greater
part of the delay. According to Houck, the
doctor was so busy on the medical side that
he neglected public relations. His second mis
take was that he did not inform his associates
who could have given him assistance. Out of
a sense of duty, according to Houck, this doc
tor thought ho could and should do the whole
job himself without bothering his colleagues.
As a result of these mistakes, all health
service and hospital doctors have been in

was not forthcoming from the hospital, an
RA. in Crothers tried to reach Houck
through the switchboard at the Palo Alto
Clinic, and the operator who was new on the
job refused to put through the call because
it was liouck's day off. Shortly afterwards,

Houck was called at his home. Roused out
of his sleep, he promised to send help immedi
ately and proceeded by alerting Dr. John
Eckert, associate director of the Health Serv
ice, and Dr. John Osborn.
According to Maroot, Houck refused to
call another doctor or appear personally.
Houck has flatly denied this accusation.
After contacting Eckert and Osborn,
Houck remained at his home and directed the
matter by phone, contacting the public health
officer and the News and Publications Office,
as he is required to do in such a situation.
AFTER TALKING to Houck, the frantic
R.A. proceeded to call various administration
officials who happened to be out of town at
a conference. He finally reached Vice Provost
Robert Wert, who promised to get some
action.
Shortly after this call at about 11:30 or
•so, the doctor arrived from the hospital with
the medicine and was already there when
Eckert and Osborn arrived. Once the doctors
began their work the situation was quickly
brought under control, and things were
nearly back to normal when Wert made a
tour of Crothers after midnight.
Despite the delays, at no time during the
evening were the stricken students in any
actual danger, because the doctor on duty at
the hospital had diagnosed early cases cor
rectly and knew from these that the out
break was not serious. His chief mistake was
that he did not realize the psychological ef

fecty of such a mass outbreak, however mild,
or anticipate the panic it might cause.
ALTHOUGH MEDICALLY competent in
his diagnosis, the doctor at the hospital made
two mistakes which account for the greater
part of the delay. According to Houck, the
doctor was so busy on the medical side that
he neglected public relations. His second mis
take was that he did not inform his associates
who could have given him assistance. Out of
a sense of duty, according to Houck, this doc
tor thought ho could and should do the whole
job himself without bothering his colleagues.
As a result of these mistakes, all health
service and hospital doctors have been in
structed to call for assistance when they fall
behind in cases of mass treatment.
BLAME FOR THE delay must also be
given to the two Crothers R.A.'s who were
not familiar with emergency procedure. As
a result, R.A.'s have been reinstructed to
phone Houck immediately in such emergen
cies and if he is not available to phone Eckert
and Osborn.
Switchboard operators at the Palo Alto
Clinic also have been instructed to put
through calls at any time to Houck, Eckert
and Osborn. According to Houck, medical at
tention would have arrived sooner that night
if the operator had not refused to put through
the call to him from Crothers.
Cause of the food poisoning which struck
many residents in Crothers, Crothers Me
morial, Stanford Village, and The Oaks (grad

women's house) has not been determined.
University Health Officer Hal W. Wilson said
that a chemical analysis of samples of food
served at Encina that night produced nega
tive results.
WILSON ADDED that the cause of the
trouble will "probably never be known" and
that cards are being processed by an IBM
machine to determine the "most probable
suspect."
The food poisoning that hit 27 women in
Durand House the week before has been
traced to the organism Clostridium pcrfrin*
gens which gained a foothold in the short
ribs because of improper refrigeration and
the fact that food was cooked Friday night
for consumption Saturday night. In this case,
Houck noted, medical treatment was handled
perfect ly.
IN NEITHER CASE, according to Wilson,
was the commissary from which Stanford
dining halls obtain their food at fault. Also,
food handling techniques at Encina con
formed perfectly to public health standards,
Wilson reports.
To avoid similar situations in the future,
Wilson said, food service employees will be
required to take a four-hour course in food
serving. At the beginning of each quarter,
new hashers will be required to take a one
hour course.
In tomorrow's edition, The Daily will ex
amine the inadequacies of the present health
service facilities and the need for a new in
firmary.

lias spent hours interviewing persons con
cerned with the food poisoning episode in an
attempt to find out what really happened be
hind the scenes. Here is his story as it pieces
together from various accounts.)
Corrective measures have been under
taken to prevent a repeat of the confusion
and panic that resulted three weeks ago when
nearly 100 Encina diners were stricken with
mild food poisoning, Dr. George Houck. direc
tor of the Health Service, and Frederic
Glover, executive assistant to the president,
revealed yesterday.
Administration officials described the
events of the evening as a "coincidence of
errors" arising out of the unfamiliarity of
several persons with emergency procedure
and difficulties in communication.
STRANGELY ENOUGH, it was the cor
rect medical judgment of the doctor on duty
at the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital that com
bined with the unfamiliarity of two resident
assistants with emergency procedure and the
negligence of a new switchboard operator at
the hospital to cause a three-hour delay in
medical attention and thereby a state of
panic among stricken graduate students at
Crothers.
As the incidents of the evening shape up,
it seems that the first food poisoning cases
were from Stanford Village and Crothers and

came personally to the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital about 8:30 p.m. The doctor on duty
diagnosed these cases and determined them
immediately to bo of a mild variety and not
serious.
Shortly after, a call was received at the
hospital from an R.A, in Crothers who im
ported several more eases. The doctor on
duty, having already treated several food
poisoning patients, told them that the out
break of food poisoning was not serious and
gave instructions for simple treatment. On
the basis of his medical judgment, he did not
consider the matter a dire emergency.
ACCORDING TO Phil Maroot, president
of Crothers Hall, 20 more students had fallen
ill by 9:30. By 10 p.m. 30 more were stricken.
Again the doctor was phoned, and he gave
the same instructions. After the fifth call,
according to Maroot, with 80 students ill by
this time, the doctor agreed to send help. Aid
did not come immediately, however, as large
amounts of medicine had to be prepared.
With the frustration of the attempts to
get hell) and with more and more students
pouring into the RA.'s rooms with com
plaints. confusion began to mount.

and panic that resulted three weeks ago when
nearly 100 Encina diners were stricken with
mild food poisoning, Dr. George Houck. direc
tor of the Health Service, and Frederic
Glover, executive assistant to the president,
revealed yesterday.
Administration officials described the
events of the evening as a "coincidence of
errors" arising out of the unfamiliarity of
several persons with emergency procedure
and difficulties in communication.
STRANGELY ENOUGH, it was the cor
rect medical judgment of the doctor on duty
at the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital that com
bined with the unfamiliarity of two resident
assistants with emergency procedure and the
negligence of a new switchboard operator at
the hospital to cause a three-hour delay in
medical attention and thereby a state of
panic among stricken graduate students at
Crothers.
As the incidents of the evening shape up,
it seems that the first food poisoning cases
were from Stanford Village and Crothers and

came personally to the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital about 8:30 p.m. The doctor on duty
diagnosed these cases and determined them
immediately to bo of a mild variety and not
serious.
Shortly after, a call was received at the
hospital from an R.A, in Crothers who im
ported several more eases. The doctor on
duty, having already treated several food
poisoning patients, told them that the out
break of food poisoning was not serious and
gave instructions for simple treatment. On
the basis of his medical judgment, he did not
consider the matter a dire emergency.
ACCORDING TO Phil Maroot, president
of Crothers Hall, 20 more students had fallen
ill by 9:30. By 10 p.m. 30 more were stricken.
Again the doctor was phoned, and he gave
the same instructions. After the fifth call,
according to Maroot, with 80 students ill by
this time, the doctor agreed to send help. Aid
did not come immediately, however, as large
amounts of medicine had to be prepared.
With the frustration of the attempts to
get hell) and with more and more students
pouring into the RA.'s rooms with com
plaints. confusion began to mount.
ABOUT II P.M. when medical attention
was not forthcoming from the hospital, an
RA. in Crothers tried to reach Houck
through the switchboard at the Palo Alto
Clinic, and the operator who was new on the
job refused to put through the call because
it was liouck's day off. Shortly afterwards,

Houck was called at his home. Roused out
of his sleep, he promised to send help immedi
ately and proceeded by alerting Dr. John
Eckert, associate director of the Health Serv
ice, and Dr. John Osborn.
According to Maroot, Houck refused to
call another doctor or appear personally.
Houck has flatly denied this accusation.
After contacting Eckert and Osborn,
Houck remained at his home and directed the
matter by phone, contacting the public health
officer and the News and Publications Office,
as he is required to do in such a situation.
AFTER TALKING to Houck, the frantic
R.A. proceeded to call various administration
officials who happened to be out of town at
a conference. He finally reached Vice Provost
Robert Wert, who promised to get some
action.
Shortly after this call at about 11:30 or
•so, the doctor arrived from the hospital with
the medicine and was already there when
Eckert and Osborn arrived. Once the doctors
began their work the situation was quickly
brought under control, and things were
nearly back to normal when Wert made a
tour of Crothers after midnight.
Despite the delays, at no time during the
evening were the stricken students in any
actual danger, because the doctor on duty at
the hospital had diagnosed early cases cor
rectly and knew from these that the out
break was not serious. His chief mistake was
that he did not realize the psychological ef

fecty of such a mass outbreak, however mild,
or anticipate the panic it might cause.
ALTHOUGH MEDICALLY competent in
his diagnosis, the doctor at the hospital made
two mistakes which account for the greater
part of the delay. According to Houck, the
doctor was so busy on the medical side that
he neglected public relations. His second mis
take was that he did not inform his associates
who could have given him assistance. Out of
a sense of duty, according to Houck, this doc
tor thought ho could and should do the whole
job himself without bothering his colleagues.
As a result of these mistakes, all health
service and hospital doctors have been in
structed to call for assistance when they fall
behind in cases of mass treatment.
BLAME FOR THE delay must also be
given to the two Crothers R.A.'s who were
not familiar with emergency procedure. As
a result, R.A.'s have been reinstructed to
phone Houck immediately in such emergen
cies and if he is not available to phone Eckert
and Osborn.
Switchboard operators at the Palo Alto
Clinic also have been instructed to put
through calls at any time to Houck, Eckert
and Osborn. According to Houck, medical at
tention would have arrived sooner that night
if the operator had not refused to put through
the call to him from Crothers.
Cause of the food poisoning which struck
many residents in Crothers, Crothers Me
morial, Stanford Village, and The Oaks (grad

women's house) has not been determined.
University Health Officer Hal W. Wilson said
that a chemical analysis of samples of food
served at Encina that night produced nega
tive results.
WILSON ADDED that the cause of the
trouble will "probably never be known" and
that cards are being processed by an IBM
machine to determine the "most probable
suspect."
The food poisoning that hit 27 women in
Durand House the week before has been
traced to the organism Clostridium pcrfrin*
gens which gained a foothold in the short
ribs because of improper refrigeration and
the fact that food was cooked Friday night
for consumption Saturday night. In this case,
Houck noted, medical treatment was handled
perfect ly.
IN NEITHER CASE, according to Wilson,
was the commissary from which Stanford
dining halls obtain their food at fault. Also,
food handling techniques at Encina con
formed perfectly to public health standards,
Wilson reports.
To avoid similar situations in the future,
Wilson said, food service employees will be
required to take a four-hour course in food
serving. At the beginning of each quarter,
new hashers will be required to take a one
hour course.
In tomorrow's edition, The Daily will ex
amine the inadequacies of the present health
service facilities and the need for a new in
firmary.
