# Pickets Showed Lack of Knowledge

The sincerity of the .African students who picketed the Belgian
Consulate in San Francisco over the death of former Congo Premier
Patrice Lumumba should not be doubted. Their wisdom should.
Mr. Maina Wanjigi, a Stanford graduate student in economics,
rightfully condemned Belgium for its failure to train native leaders
and to find native financing to support the country. Unfortunately,
Mr. Wanjigi tied his case to the dead body of Mr. Lumumba. It is
the same dead body the Soviets have seized upon as part of their
three-pronged offensive to wreck the United Nations, destroy and ,
disrupt the Western Allies, and gain for themselves a sphere of
influence in the African continent. The African students should not:
be fooled by the late Mr. Lumumba as a man of democracy. Rather
he was a demagogue and would-be dictator who was openly sup-1
ported by the Soviets in their bid for a chunk of the Congo. It is
apparent that he was slain only when the United Nations had seem
ingly settled on a plan of peace for the Congo which would have
meant the release of Mr. Lumumba from custody. As Mr. Lipp- j
mann has suggested it is clear that the Soviets backed then by;
Lumumba and now by the Communist-trained Antoine Gizenga, i
and the Belgium-supported Tshombe in the rich Katanga Province,
want to fight a civil war. Both believe they have more to gain in'
this way.
The irony of the Africans picketing is that their sincere effort -
became meshed into a world-wide chain of propaganda riots alleg-!
edly mourning the death of Lumumba, but decidedly anti-Western .
in taste. They have been associated with the Soviet effort to dump i
Secretary General Hammarskjold and with the Soviets sending of
arms and assistance to Gizenga's regime in Stanleyville.
True Mr. Hammarskjold is not a colorful character. Yet what
is needed is not flashy demagogue politicians.
Even worse is the political naivete of the African students and
some full-fledged African leaders, for they are like little boys play
ing with political fire. The best chance for a solution through a
workable compromise lies with Mr. Hammarskjold. Hopefully, he
will provide the solid-thinking needed here.
