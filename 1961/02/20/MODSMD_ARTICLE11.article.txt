## Discrimination Debaters Use ATO's as Example 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Second semester rushing and
Stanford's Alpha Tau Omega
(ATO) fraternity have caused col
umns of comment and controversy
in campus newspapers across the

mntry.
Cal's Daily Cal
ornian reprinted
January 29 edi
irial from the
a n Francisco
Ixaminer. T h-e
ditorial cited
tanford's ATO
icident as proof
hat "Social fra
erni t ie s in

schools for ad
vanced education have outworn
and outlived themselves."
THE DAILY Californian, in
their own editorial on the follow
ing day, stated "We counter with
the opposite viewpoint. Fraterni
ties, when upholding strong Amer
ican principles and ideals, are val
uable instruments in maintaining
the cohesive values within the
lives of our 'anonymous youth.' "
"We would say that Alpha Tau
Omega was speaking for the mod
ern fraternity," the Daily Cal edi
tor continued. "They were say
ing 'Watch out National. We want
to become a brotherhood based on
equality of the individual.'"
No editorial in any of the hun
dreds of student papers which I
have seen has criticized the action
of the Stanford ATO chapter.
Typical of the opinions which
were expressed is that of the Uni
versity of Washington Daily
which said "We think the chapter
merits a small round of applause
for standing up for its convic
tions."
DISCRIMINATION in fraterni
ties is being outlawed or attacked
by state governments, university
administrations, and student pick
ets .The Oregon State Board of
Higher Education set a two-year
deadline last month for college
fraternities and sororities to elimi
nate discriminatory clauses from
their constitutions. Both Dart
mouth and Williams have told the

fraternities on their campuses
they must remove the discrimina
tory clauses from their charters
or go off campus.
At Cornell University, four stu
dents picketed the Sigma Chi
house on the charge that the fra
ternity practiced "overt discrimi
nation." Editorials in the Cornell
Daily Sun supported the pickets
and stated, "The rushing prac
tices of too many of Cornell's fra
ternities reflect the narrowness
and bigotry that a college educa
tion is supposed to dispell."
THE CORNELL Sun also criti
cizes other aspects of rushing at
Cornell's 53 fraternities. "Rushing
is damnably superficial. . . . Fra
ternities do not choose members
the way one would like to select
a friend. There is little time to
discern the inner worth of anyone
who is outwardly unappealing. To
those who are not superficially in
clined, both in fraternities and in
the freshmen dorms, rushing can
be discouraging."
A later editorial in the Cornell
jryewspaper advises each fresh
man to seriously consider the pos
sibility of joining no fraternity.
The stand taken by Stanford's
ATO chapter revived debate on
ATO discrimination at the Uni
versity of Minnesota. The Univer
sity of Minnesota issued a univer
sity statement in 1949 which said,
"The selection of members by stu
dent organizations should be
based upon the congeniality,
merit, and interests of the indi
vidual student."
AFTER a four-month contro
versy, the Senate Committee on
Student Affairs, which is com
posed of students at the univer
sity, voted that ATO is not violat
ing university policy by limiting
its membership to Christians. The
Senate decision was supported by
the Dean of Students, who said,
"In order to eliminate discrimina
tion we are asking every group
tn give up their religious core."
The Minnesota Daily questioned
the reasoning behind the Senate
decision.
Two weeks later the University
of Minnesota read about the Stan-

ford ATO chapter. Several mem
bers of the Senate suggested that
they should reconsider their de
cision. This suggestion was ta
bled until more information
about "the Stanford incident" was
found.
The only information Ihe Sen
ate had was that given by ATO's
national president Gerald John
son and reprinted in the Minne
sota Daily. Johnson stated that
the Stanford chapter has 12 to 1r>
Jewish members already, and
would "soon be composed entirely
of non-Christians."
Race discrimination in frater
nities is disappearing, somewhat
spasmodically, in the United
States. However, as Ralph Bunche
said last Wednesday, "The sphere
of race relations is one field in
which no one does as much as he
could do."

is damnably superficial. . . . Fra
ternities do not choose members
the way one would like to select
a friend. There is little time to
discern the inner worth of anyone
who is outwardly unappealing. To
those who are not superficially in
clined, both in fraternities and in
the freshmen dorms, rushing can
be discouraging."
A later editorial in the Cornell
jryewspaper advises each fresh
man to seriously consider the pos
sibility of joining no fraternity.
The stand taken by Stanford's
ATO chapter revived debate on
ATO discrimination at the Uni
versity of Minnesota. The Univer
sity of Minnesota issued a univer
sity statement in 1949 which said,
"The selection of members by stu
dent organizations should be
based upon the congeniality,
merit, and interests of the indi
vidual student."
AFTER a four-month contro
versy, the Senate Committee on
Student Affairs, which is com
posed of students at the univer
sity, voted that ATO is not violat
ing university policy by limiting
its membership to Christians. The
Senate decision was supported by
the Dean of Students, who said,
"In order to eliminate discrimina
tion we are asking every group
tn give up their religious core."
The Minnesota Daily questioned
the reasoning behind the Senate
decision.
Two weeks later the University
of Minnesota read about the Stan-

ford ATO chapter. Several mem
bers of the Senate suggested that
they should reconsider their de
cision. This suggestion was ta
bled until more information
about "the Stanford incident" was
found.
The only information Ihe Sen
ate had was that given by ATO's
national president Gerald John
son and reprinted in the Minne
sota Daily. Johnson stated that
the Stanford chapter has 12 to 1r>
Jewish members already, and
would "soon be composed entirely
of non-Christians."
Race discrimination in frater
nities is disappearing, somewhat
spasmodically, in the United
States. However, as Ralph Bunche
said last Wednesday, "The sphere
of race relations is one field in
which no one does as much as he
could do."

Second semester rushing and
Stanford's Alpha Tau Omega
(ATO) fraternity have caused col

in campus newspapers across the

Ixaminer. T h-e
ditorial cited
tanford's ATO

schools for ad

and outlived themselves."
THE DAILY Californian, in
their own editorial on the follow

the opposite viewpoint. Fraterni
ties, when upholding strong Amer
ican principles and ideals, are val
uable instruments in maintaining
the cohesive values within the
lives of our 'anonymous youth.' "
"We would say that Alpha Tau
Omega was speaking for the mod
ern fraternity," the Daily Cal edi
tor continued. "They were say
ing 'Watch out National. We want
to become a brotherhood based on
equality of the individual.'"
No editorial in any of the hun
dreds of student papers which I
have seen has criticized the action
of the Stanford ATO chapter.
Typical of the opinions which
were expressed is that of the Uni
versity of Washington Daily
which said "We think the chapter
merits a small round of applause
for standing up for its convic
tions."
DISCRIMINATION in fraterni
ties is being outlawed or attacked
by state governments, university
administrations, and student pick
ets .The Oregon State Board of
Higher Education set a two-year
deadline last month for college
fraternities and sororities to elimi
nate discriminatory clauses from
their constitutions. Both Dart
mouth and Williams have told the

fraternities on their campuses
they must remove the discrimina
tory clauses from their charters
or go off campus.
At Cornell University, four stu
dents picketed the Sigma Chi
house on the charge that the fra
ternity practiced "overt discrimi

and stated, "The rushing prac

Second semester rushing and
Stanford's Alpha Tau Omega
(ATO) fraternity have caused col
umns of comment and controversy
in campus newspapers across the

mntry.
Cal's Daily Cal
ornian reprinted
January 29 edi
irial from the
a n Francisco
Ixaminer. T h-e
ditorial cited
tanford's ATO
icident as proof
hat "Social fra
erni t ie s in

schools for ad
vanced education have outworn
and outlived themselves."
THE DAILY Californian, in
their own editorial on the follow
ing day, stated "We counter with
the opposite viewpoint. Fraterni
ties, when upholding strong Amer
ican principles and ideals, are val
uable instruments in maintaining
the cohesive values within the
lives of our 'anonymous youth.' "
"We would say that Alpha Tau
Omega was speaking for the mod
ern fraternity," the Daily Cal edi
tor continued. "They were say
ing 'Watch out National. We want
to become a brotherhood based on
equality of the individual.'"
No editorial in any of the hun
dreds of student papers which I
have seen has criticized the action
of the Stanford ATO chapter.
Typical of the opinions which
were expressed is that of the Uni
versity of Washington Daily
which said "We think the chapter
merits a small round of applause
for standing up for its convic
tions."
DISCRIMINATION in fraterni
ties is being outlawed or attacked
by state governments, university
administrations, and student pick
ets .The Oregon State Board of
Higher Education set a two-year
deadline last month for college
fraternities and sororities to elimi
nate discriminatory clauses from
their constitutions. Both Dart
mouth and Williams have told the

fraternities on their campuses
they must remove the discrimina
tory clauses from their charters
or go off campus.
At Cornell University, four stu
dents picketed the Sigma Chi
house on the charge that the fra
ternity practiced "overt discrimi
nation." Editorials in the Cornell
Daily Sun supported the pickets
and stated, "The rushing prac
tices of too many of Cornell's fra
ternities reflect the narrowness
and bigotry that a college educa
tion is supposed to dispell."
THE CORNELL Sun also criti
cizes other aspects of rushing at
Cornell's 53 fraternities. "Rushing
is damnably superficial. . . . Fra
ternities do not choose members
the way one would like to select
a friend. There is little time to
discern the inner worth of anyone
who is outwardly unappealing. To
those who are not superficially in
clined, both in fraternities and in
the freshmen dorms, rushing can
be discouraging."
A later editorial in the Cornell
jryewspaper advises each fresh
man to seriously consider the pos
sibility of joining no fraternity.
The stand taken by Stanford's
ATO chapter revived debate on
ATO discrimination at the Uni
versity of Minnesota. The Univer
sity of Minnesota issued a univer
sity statement in 1949 which said,
"The selection of members by stu
dent organizations should be
based upon the congeniality,
merit, and interests of the indi
vidual student."
AFTER a four-month contro
versy, the Senate Committee on
Student Affairs, which is com
posed of students at the univer
sity, voted that ATO is not violat
ing university policy by limiting
its membership to Christians. The
Senate decision was supported by
the Dean of Students, who said,
"In order to eliminate discrimina
tion we are asking every group
tn give up their religious core."
The Minnesota Daily questioned
the reasoning behind the Senate
decision.
Two weeks later the University
of Minnesota read about the Stan-

ford ATO chapter. Several mem
bers of the Senate suggested that
they should reconsider their de
cision. This suggestion was ta
bled until more information
about "the Stanford incident" was
found.
The only information Ihe Sen
ate had was that given by ATO's
national president Gerald John
son and reprinted in the Minne
sota Daily. Johnson stated that
the Stanford chapter has 12 to 1r>
Jewish members already, and
would "soon be composed entirely
of non-Christians."
Race discrimination in frater
nities is disappearing, somewhat
spasmodically, in the United
States. However, as Ralph Bunche
said last Wednesday, "The sphere
of race relations is one field in
which no one does as much as he
could do."
