## Cultural Work With Negro Children Lends Chance for individual Action 
### 
Ralph Bunche made a telling
point in his talk last Thursday
morning when he declared that
better race relations begin with
the individual — that human
beings, not laws, make or break
attempts to foster amity among
races.
He was right, of course. Indi
vidual action will in the long run
determine whether Negroes and
whites learn to live peacefully to
gether in all parts of this country,
and the world. It would seem safe
to state that most people in the
U.S., including those at Stanford,
honestly believe that a person's
skin color should make no differ
ence whatsoever when it comes to
renting a home, attending school
or eating at a lunch counter.
BUT THE stark fact is that
hardly anyone bestirs himself as
an individual to actively work to
ward the goal of racial equality
or any other important goal.
We sit back and let others do
the actual work, content to oc
casionally let our views be known
if we're offered the opportunity.
The situation is brought into
sharp focus at Stanford, which
has what must be rated the most
apathetic student body on the
West Coast.
It is highly unusual for any
number of students to get worked
up enough to take direct action in
favor or protest of anything.
When any commotion does arise,
we've found the same few people
generally involved —very rarely
does a new face pop up.
THERE IS no significant move
ment on the campus of students
actively working for peace, sup
porting or fighting the HUAC,
and none presenting candidates
pledged to making student gov
ernment a meaningful, active
leader on the campus.
Thus, when a movement de
voted to action on some vital issue
does try to get a start, it faces
tough going. Certainly the people
who are attempting to get Stan
ford students interested in work
ing to raise the cultural level of
Negro and Mexican children in
the local area—and at the same
time prod better race relations—
face a problem.
BUT THEY believe in the pro
gram enough to have called a
meeting for 4 p.m. today in the

lounge nf the Women's Clubhouse'
to got the ball rolling. Their pur-1
pose is simple as many Stanford
students as desire can work in
the program by providing trans-'
portation for the children to cul-j
tural events in the Bay Area, by
acting as chaperones. and so forth.j
About the only reward would
perhaps be the sight of some
Negro or Mexican kid coming in- j
tellectually alive during a concert j
or while engaging in some other j
cultural activity.
But it would seem to us that I
there would be no better way to j
spend a Saturday than actually
DOING SOMETHING to help'
someone not quite as fortunate as 1

I we—that is. making a definite in
-1 dividual action toward an emi
nently worthwhile goal.
All we can do is hope that or
ganizations such as the Newman
Club. Wesley Foundation, WYCA
and others might lend their back
! ing to the project and maybe
even some of the fraternities and
eating clubs could find the time
! to help out.
But most of all. we hope that
; individuals from all over the cam
pus will show up at today's meet
i ing. ready and willing to partici
: pate in a project devoted to help
' ing children who need it and per
haps at ihe same time helping
' themselves.

We sit back and let others do
the actual work, content to oc
casionally let our views be known
if we're offered the opportunity.
The situation is brought into
sharp focus at Stanford, which
has what must be rated the most
apathetic student body on the
West Coast.
It is highly unusual for any
number of students to get worked
up enough to take direct action in
favor or protest of anything.
When any commotion does arise,
we've found the same few people
generally involved —very rarely
does a new face pop up.
THERE IS no significant move
ment on the campus of students
actively working for peace, sup
porting or fighting the HUAC,
and none presenting candidates
pledged to making student gov
ernment a meaningful, active
leader on the campus.
Thus, when a movement de
voted to action on some vital issue
does try to get a start, it faces
tough going. Certainly the people
who are attempting to get Stan
ford students interested in work
ing to raise the cultural level of
Negro and Mexican children in
the local area—and at the same
time prod better race relations—
face a problem.
BUT THEY believe in the pro
gram enough to have called a
meeting for 4 p.m. today in the

lounge nf the Women's Clubhouse'
to got the ball rolling. Their pur-1
pose is simple as many Stanford
students as desire can work in
the program by providing trans-'
portation for the children to cul-j
tural events in the Bay Area, by
acting as chaperones. and so forth.j
About the only reward would
perhaps be the sight of some
Negro or Mexican kid coming in- j
tellectually alive during a concert j
or while engaging in some other j
cultural activity.
But it would seem to us that I
there would be no better way to j
spend a Saturday than actually
DOING SOMETHING to help'
someone not quite as fortunate as 1

I we—that is. making a definite in
-1 dividual action toward an emi
nently worthwhile goal.
All we can do is hope that or
ganizations such as the Newman
Club. Wesley Foundation, WYCA
and others might lend their back
! ing to the project and maybe
even some of the fraternities and
eating clubs could find the time
! to help out.
But most of all. we hope that
; individuals from all over the cam
pus will show up at today's meet
i ing. ready and willing to partici
: pate in a project devoted to help
' ing children who need it and per
haps at ihe same time helping
' themselves.
Ralph Bunche made a telling
point in his talk last Thursday
morning when he declared that
better race relations begin with
the individual — that human
beings, not laws, make or break
attempts to foster amity among
races.
He was right, of course. Indi
vidual action will in the long run
determine whether Negroes and
whites learn to live peacefully to
gether in all parts of this country,
and the world. It would seem safe
to state that most people in the
U.S., including those at Stanford,
honestly believe that a person's
skin color should make no differ
ence whatsoever when it comes to
renting a home, attending school
or eating at a lunch counter.
BUT THE stark fact is that
hardly anyone bestirs himself as
an individual to actively work to
ward the goal of racial equality
or any other important goal.
