# Bear Cagers Edge Cards Twice
## Indian Attempt At Comeback Fails, 52-50 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Coming back from a nine-point
deficit with less than four minutes
left to play, Stanford put on one
of their patented cliff-hanging
finishes before bowing to the Cali
fornia Bears, 52-50, in Friday
night's basketball game at the
"mad house" Pavilion.
Tempers flared after the final
buzzer when a local rooter made
off with one of the Cal bands
men's straw hat and the visiting
footers gave chase. The ensuing
battle raged for several minutes,
but even in the list-swinging the
Stanfordites could do no better
than a standoff before Cal and
Stanford athletic directors Pete
Newell and Chuck Taylor ended
the affair.
O.N TIIK playing court the
Bears dominated the action for
most of the game. Missing the
consistent scoring touch of senior
forward John Hendry, who didn't
play because of a virus attack, the
Cards took a sound beating from
the California front line.
Although Indian forwards John
Windsor and Phil Kelly combined
for 2S points and Windsor gar
nered 11 rebounds, the locals lost
the duel at the post spot as Cal
center Stan Morrison scored 17
markers and grabbed 11 rebounds
while Stanford pivotman Mike
Ledgerwood didn't hit a single at
tempt from the field and managed
a total of only two points for the
evening.
Kelly got the first field goal in
the fray with a minute gone to
give the locals a 2-0 lead, but that
was Ihe last time Stanford was
ahead.
CAI/S STAR forward Bill Mc-
Clintock twined the tying two
counter and guard Dick Smith
added a three-point play to give
the Berkeleyites a lead they never
relinquished.
Midway through the first half
the Blue and Gold had widened
the gap to nine, a margin they
guarded carefully, leaving for
intermission with a 32-23 bulge.
The Bears took up where they
left off in the second stanza, at

one point sporting an 11-point
lead, mainly through the efforts
of Morrison, who picked up three
straight fielders at one point.
TIIKN, with 3:35 left on the
clock, Ledgrwood sunk a foul
shot, Bub Bowling hit for two and
reserve Darrell Sutherla n d
dunked in four to pull the Cards
within three points of the win
ners.
The rooters began sensing an
Indian victory, and Kelly kept
their hopes alive with a layin, but
