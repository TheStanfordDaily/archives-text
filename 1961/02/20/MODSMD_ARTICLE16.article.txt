## Daily Sports 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford's Indian basketbal lers ran circles around a hunch of
in«'l>l California Bears lor llk* lir.«l half and then traded roles itli
the wearers of the Blue and (»old in I lie seeond stanza as the Bears
made a terrilie seeond half comeback lo lake a 61-61 deeision
over the (lards in Harmon (»\in at Berkeley Saturday.

In what must be one of the big
pest reversals in California-Stan
ford hoop history, the Berkeley
ites overcame a 21 point 45-24
Stanford halftime bulge to hold
the Tribe to only 16 counters in
the second period while scoring 40
themselves for their second win
over the Indians in two nights and
their third of the season.
AFTER a wonderful halftime
gymnastics show put on by the
California School for the Blind,
Stanford's cagers looked as though
they might have been graduates
of the same institution. The Bears
put on a fierce full court press
that had the Cards continually
throwing the ball away to the
home team, and when ihe Tribe
did manage to pass the 10 second
line, their shots were all short or
wide of their mark.
So well did the Cal press work
that the Indians didn't get a score
in the second half until John
Windsor slipped behind the Bear
defense for an easy layin with
1:10 gone after the Blue and Gold
had tallied 14 straight points.
THE LOCAL round b a 11 er s
staged a mild rally a third of the
way through the second period
when flu-weakened John Hendry
came off the bench and sank a 15
foot jump shot, followed by a layin
by center Mike Ledgerwood and
foul shots by Darrell Sutherland
and Ledgerwood to boost the In
dians' margin to 54-4.) after the
Bears had closed to five points,
15-50, on Bill McClintock's push
shot from the side.
But then Cal's Stan Morrison

look over. Scoring 12 of his 18
points in the last 11 minutes, 1he
big Bear almost single hanrieclly
sank the Indians' hopes.
McClintoek put Cal ahead for
good, 63-61, with two charity
tosses with two and a half min
utes remaining, and little Bobby
Wendell added one more to seal
the Cards' doom.
CALIFORNIA won its victory
with rebounds and free throws.
Led by McClintock's 14 grabs and
Morrison's 9, the Bears gathered
in a total of 45 looseballs to only
27 for the Tribe hoopsters.
This was especially disastrous
in the second half of the contest
when the locals were hitting only
5 for 16 from the field, nowhere
near their 62 per cent (18 x29> in
the first half.
