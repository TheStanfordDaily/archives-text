STUDENTS PICKET U.S. NAVY RECRUITING VAN
Seven Stanford students, including three girls, picketed the
U.S. Navy recruiting van which was parked outside the Civ
Libe Friday. Saying they were not members of any organ
ized group, the students stood near the van's entrance from
noon until 1:15 passing out leaflets and carrying on discus
sions with members of a small group of onlookers which
gathered. They carried a couple of signs declaring "This
Navy exhibit is a link in the arms race," and "A positive
response to this exhibit is a negative response to peace."
No trouble was caused by the demonstration.
