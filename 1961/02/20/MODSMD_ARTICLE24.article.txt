WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE

Today lot up take up the subject of etymolopv (or entomology,
as it is sometimes called) which is the study ol word origins
(or insects, as they are sometimes called).
Where arc word origins (insects) to he found? Well sir, some
times words are proper names that have passed into the language.
Take, for instance, the words used in electricity: am pen was
named after its discoverer, the Frenchman Andre Marie Ampere
(177')-IN.'M); similarly olnn w;is named after the German (i. S.
(>hm (17N1-1854), watt after the Scot James Watt (1 7-*>-1 s 1
and hull) after the American Fred C. Bulb (184H-UM2).
There is, incidentally, quite a poignant little story about Mr.
Bulb. Until Bulb's invention, all illumination was provided by
gas, which was named after its inventor Milton T. (ins who,
strange to tell, had been Bulb's roommate at ('al Tech! In fact,
strange to tell, the third man sharing the room with Bulb and
Gas was also one whose name burns bright in the annals of
illumination —Walter Candle!
The three roommates were inseparable companions in col
lege. After graduation all three did research in the problem of
artificial light, which at this time did not exist. All America
used to go to bed with the chickens. In fact, many Americans
?/'</•( chickens.
Well sir, the three comrades—Bulb, Gas, and Candle
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but success,
aliis, spoiled :ill that. First Candle invented the candle, got
rich, and forgot his old friends. Then (ias invented g:is, got rich,
bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old Iriends. 1 hen Bulb in
vented the bulb, got rich, bankrupted Gas, and forgot his
old friends.

Candle ami Gas, bitter and impoverished at the age respee
tively of 7.") and 71, went 1«) sea as respectively the world's
oldest and second oldest cabin boy. Bulb, rich and grand, also
went to sea, but lie went in style—as a first-class passenger on
luxury liners.
Well sir, strange to tell, all three were aboard the ill-fated
Lusitania when she was sunk in the North Atlantic. And,
si range to tell, when they were swimming for their lives after the
shipwreck, :ill three clambered aboard the s:tme dinghy!
Well sir. chastened and made wiser by their brush with death,
they fell into each other's arms and wept and exchanged for
giveness and became fast friends all over again.
I 'or three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands and
sinking the C'al Tech rouser all the while. Then, at long last,
they spied a pacing liner and were taken aboard.
They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,
I regret to report, were not many, because the liner which picked
them up was the Titanic.
What a pity that Marlboros were not invented during the
lifetimes of Bulb, (las, and Candle! Had there been Marlboros,
these three friends never would have grown apart because they
Would have known how much, despite their differences, they still
had in common. I mean to say that Marlboros can be lit by
candle, by gas, or by electricity, and no matter how you 1 i y.lll
them, you always get a full-flavored smoke, a filter cigarette
with an unfillered taste that makes anyone—including Bulb,
(las, and Candle settle back and forget anger and strife and
-mile the <wcet smile of friendship on all who pas*!

Well sir, the three comrades—Bulb, Gas, and Candle
promised to be friends forever when they left school, but success,
