Stanford freshman GaryT. Wal
ker is recuperating in Stanford-
Palo Alto Hospital this morning
after a narrow brush with death
or serious injury Saturday night

when he swiped a hat from the
head of one of the members of
Cal's Straw Hat Band after the
Cal-Stanford basketball game at
Harmon Gym, UC police reported.

TIIE 18-year-old top half-miler
on the freshman track team raced
out of the gym with Cal students
in hot pursuit. About a quarter
of a mile away, he entered the
construction site of the new Edu
cation Psychology Building.
Seeking a hiding place, Walker
pushed aside a plywood barrier,
stepped behind it and plunged
i to the bottom of a 30-foot elevator
excavation. The Cal students
summoned aid.
Berkeley firemen lowered a
I man and a basket stretcher into
| the hole and took Walker to Cow
ell Memorial Hospital, where doc
j tors at first thought he had suf
fered a compound fracture of the
j ankle and possible internal inju
ries.
BUT IT was determined yester-
I day that he had suffered no bro
j ken bones, but was very bruised,
| with cuts on his legs and feet.
Walker's R.A. and corridor
mates in Junipero Wilbur said the
only thing which saved him from
possible death or serious injury
was a beam which he struck near
the bottom of the shaft, which
flipped him over and caused him
to land on his shoulder.
Walker was well enough recov
ered last night to watch "Mave
rick" from his bed at the hospital.
He is expected to be released in
a few days.
The Cal students reclaimed the
Straw Hatter's bonnet.
