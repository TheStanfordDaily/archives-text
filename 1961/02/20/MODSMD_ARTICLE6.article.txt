# One-Acts Termed Highly Entertaining

### SONYA MICHEL 
Working under the handicaps
of a difficult medium three-quar
ters round stage- and weak, stu
dent-written scripts, Ram's Head
has produced three highly cnter
; taining "Winter One-Acts."
The best thing about the first
play, "White Mountain Laurel," is
, not James Lyon's script, but the
j set. It is a clever adaptation of
; three scenes to one stage. The
separate areas are defined by
I lighting, and the need for set
1 changes is eliminated.
LABORING under Mr. Lyon's
leaden lines are Jan I-lowells, El
: lon Stenzel, Mike Browne and
, Steve Sandlin. The first three i
i play superstitious mountain folk 1
: in the Ozarks during the Civil
i War. Sandlin is the "valley man"
i who intrudes with his "city ways."
The stiffness of the love scenes i
between Miss Howells and Sand-;
lin. and Miss Stenzel and Sandlin, i
is undoubtedly duo to the ponder
ous speeches they must make.
! Even so, Miss Stenzel lightens the !
play with her appearance and
voice, and appears to fit her name,
"Laurel."
Unfortunately, Mr. Lyon tries
to pack too many issues into a
one-act play. Ho has three deaths,
two love triangles, more super
stition than the Salem witch tri
als, and the futility of man's
fighting wars.
THE best-written play, and the
one most suitable to performance
in one act is "The Leash," by
Pauline Peotter. It has a small,
well-chosen cast, and unfolds,
within a short time, three complex
characters.
Fred Wat kins is a petulant, in-
I secure young man grasping des
perately for both the love of his
| sister, played by Barbara Stevens,
and a smooth, second-rate artist
played by Dave Kirk.
Kirk plays his role with the
necessary glibness and slippery
over-confidence. Wat kins, in con
trast, is sullen and moody. Miss
| Stevens borders on hysteria at |
j times, but adds a note of realism;
i to t he plot.
MAY I >E I.A IT El. I) designed the
I set for "The Leash." It is simple

but striking. The lighting and mu
sic, however, detract from, rather
than perpetuate, the mood.
Director Judy Schrader rescued
most courageously the extremely
weak script of "When in Rome"
by perfect casting. Although there
are actually very few funny linos
in the comedy, each of the actors
manages to catch the farcial Pio
man mood and lift it to a humor
ous level.
Peggy Cowles is lovely as Aunt
Simpronia, the alcoholic ex-mis
tress of the Flavian Estates. Pe
tronius, a gay young man-about
town. is well done by John Mc-
Daniels, as is Gaius, his juvenile
delinquent younger brother, by
Jim Fox. Phemie Browness is
marvelously uninhibited as Chry
saphia, Petronius' mistress.
PEGGY Radin becomes tire
some as Luciprila, mother of Pe
tronius and Gaius, and would-be
Roman socialite. One could do
with fewer of her shrieks for Me
tell us, the appropriately haggard
slave, played by Hal Gibbons, or
her carping at husband Horatius,
capably portrayed by David Erick
son.
Anita Korpi sparkles as Claudia,
Luciprila's bracelet- and gossip
bearing friend. She has some of
the best lines in the play and de
livers them with much aplomb.
Both the costumes by Judy Patt
and sets by Dick Hopkins add to
the play. Exaggerations such as
luscious pink-marble columns, and
Chrysaphia's practically nonexist
ent gown are imaginative touches.
BY KHKKK enthusiasm, and with
a great deal of spirit. Ram's Head
has fulfilled one of the important
functions of university drama
groups: producing student-written
plays.
The fact that all three scripts
are quite weak, and, as such, dif
ficult 1o carry off, does not deter
the group from creating a worth
while program.
The "One-Acts" will again lake
the Little Theater stage Friday
and Saturday nights. Tickets are
on sale for $1.50 at the Ram's
Head Office, at Memorial Audito
rium Box Office or at the door
this weekend.
