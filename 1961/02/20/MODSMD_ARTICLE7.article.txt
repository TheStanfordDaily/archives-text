# Ah, Spring! Wilburites Stage Mass 'Car Wash'
## 
### 
Stanford got a taste of spring
weather yesterday, and the fresh
man men, like the faithful ground
hog, came out of their burrow in
Wilbur, looked at their shadows
and decided it was time to indulge
in some mass outdoor activity.
So they staged a water fight
(frosh against autos) on Escon
dido Road in front of Wilbur. Net
results were a couple of smashed
windshields, 200 or so soaked
freshmen, an hour and a half of
merriment and a threat by throe
irate motorists to file complaints
with the law.
IT ALL started when some
frosh gave up booking about 3
p.m. and armed for a water fight.
Somehow the group spilled out
onto the sidewalk in front of Wil
bur and began heaving balloons
filled with water into passing con
vertibles.
In addition to the trusty penny
balloons, they were armed with
hoses and fire extinguishers.
Egged on by tamer types ob
serving from across the street in
the safety of Branner, Toyon and

Crothers Memorial, the hord<
gave each passing open-top ve
hide (and a few hardtops) a thor
ough dousing. Some of the vic
tims liked it so much they came
back for more.
ON A couple of occasions, a few
of the "mad bombers" forayed
across the street, chasing the
Branner lovelies and the Toyon
ites to the safety of closed win
dows.
Bui spirits were dampened, so
to speak, when one of the Farm's
motorcycle cops roared through
the flooded street and informed
one and all that three non-Stan
ford motorists had reported they
were planning to file official com
plaints today about the behavior
of the "Stanford toughs."
