# 15 YEARS IN PLANNING STAGE
## Health Director Tells Need for New Infirmary 
### ROSS HERMANN Night Managing Editor 
"For the last 1") years since I came here,
my dream has been a new university in
firmary. At your age it is hard to realize
being frustrated for 15 years." So spoke Dr.
(Jeorge flouck, director of the Health Serv
ice. as he outlined to the Daily this week the
pressing need for a new infirmary.
"Plans for an infirmary were first pro-

proposed in the 1920'5, re
vised in the 1930'5, reached
the planning stage in the
1940'5, and began to take
definite shape in the 1950'5"
Houek said.
WITH THE growth of
the undergraduate student
body since World War If, an
infirmary to replace the rest
homes, the isolation hospital
and the present health serv
ice offices has become a

necessity for the welfare and convenience of
the students, he stated.
I-louck reported that when the student
body was much smaller the health service
was able to offer a greater variety of services
on campus and more personalized treatment.
As the Universitv grew, however, the Health

Service became more and more a place where
cases are evaluated and sorted and then often
referred elsewhere for treatment. Some
minor services are still handled on campus,
but many others are offered only at the Palo
Alto Clinic with which the Health Service has
a contract for the provision of services to
Stanford students.
In giving an impression of the size of the
daily workload, Houck said that during the
average day the Health Service handles about
350 cases. Some of these, he pointed out. are
immunizations for the overseas campuses
who should be kept separate from the sick
but who are all handled now in the same
place. This source alone accounts for about
15,000 cases a year.
THE PROBLEM in handling such a work
load, Houck said. i« to do a good job of pick
ing out those patients who need more treat
ment than the routine case.
Houck felt that the most immediate need
of the Health Service is to add at least two
more doctors to the present staff of seven.
There would be no problem in finding doc
tors, he said. The only limitation is space.
"Only one thing is adequate," he said,
"and that is my office."
In describing the need for a new infirm
ary, Houck said that the old rest homes are

completely inadequate. The Men's Rest Home
has only 11 beds, while the Women's Rest
Home has nine. He described the Isolation
Hospital, where patients with communicable
diseases are treated, as a "pest hole."
ANOTHER UN DESIRABLE situation has
developed in that pneumonia patients have
to be treated at the rest homes when the Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital is filled.
As Houck envisions it, the new infirmary
would be a two-story building within easy
walking distance of the mall area containing
accommodations for at least 50 patients. This
figure is based on the theory of five hospital
beds for every thousand students with the
size of the student body projected over a
five-year period. Within this time, registra
tion will increase to about 10,000, Houck pre
dicted.
The structure, which would cost about
$750,000, would contain sufficient space to
isolate communicable disease patients from
the sick and to break down those categories
by sex. The infirmary would care for all
illnesses, except those requiring major
surgery.
THE FIRST floor of the building would
be occupied by Health Service offices, while
the hospital area would be restricted to the
second floor.

Houck expressed the belief that the new
infirmary would go a long way toward hu
manizing Health Service treatment in that
it could provide fuller, more considerate care.
At present, many students feel that treat
ment at the Health Service is incomplete and
impersonal. As a result some students have
lost faith in the Health Service aqd often
joke that no matter what illness they may
have they are always given "sugar pills."
This unfortunate attitude has been caused
generally by the necessity of processing cases
quickly in order to handle the excessive work
load.
HOICK SAID that a special sensitivity on
the part, of the doctors to the patient's feel
ings and worries is required to eliminate this
attitude. At college, he noted, the majority
of the patients are of the same age group
and live under the same conditions of stress.
The college age group, ho pointed out, is
marked by emotional problems with symp
toms that are frightening to the individual
and often by illnesses left over from child
hood. Treatment of these problems, Houck
said, falls somewhere between pediatrics and
general medicine and might be best termed
"hebiatrics," which means adolescent medi
cine.
The physical problems of the college stu

w
dent, he said, require no special training.
What is special is how these problems affeet
the patient, how he views them, and how he
responds to them. Effective treatment must
include sensitivity on the part of the doctor
to these psychological effects.
Houck blasted away a popular belief when
he revealed jokingly that hypocondriacs are
not given special designation on their records.
He noted that this belief has arisen partly
from the fact that the charts of alergy pa
tients are specially marked.
ASIDE FROM making possible an en
larged staff and better treatment, a new in
firmary would also provide the necessary
space for a mental health program to be
headed by a full-time psychiatrist. Also other
functions that are now handled by the Palo
Alto Clinic would be offered by the infirmary,
such as chest X-rays.
Houck emphasized that the new infirmary
is only one of a set of proposals now under
consideration for the expansion of the Health
Service. Once plans are completely formu
lated, they will come up before the admin
istration for a series of discussions and nego
tiations, probably within the next two
months. Viewing the progress of the last 15
years, Houck said he would lie overjoyed if
construction starts in the next three years.

ment than the routine case.
Houck felt that the most immediate need
of the Health Service is to add at least two
more doctors to the present staff of seven.
There would be no problem in finding doc
tors, he said. The only limitation is space.
"Only one thing is adequate," he said,
"and that is my office."
In describing the need for a new infirm
ary, Houck said that the old rest homes are

completely inadequate. The Men's Rest Home
has only 11 beds, while the Women's Rest
Home has nine. He described the Isolation
Hospital, where patients with communicable
diseases are treated, as a "pest hole."
ANOTHER UN DESIRABLE situation has
developed in that pneumonia patients have
to be treated at the rest homes when the Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital is filled.
As Houck envisions it, the new infirmary
would be a two-story building within easy
walking distance of the mall area containing
accommodations for at least 50 patients. This
figure is based on the theory of five hospital
beds for every thousand students with the
size of the student body projected over a
five-year period. Within this time, registra
tion will increase to about 10,000, Houck pre
dicted.
The structure, which would cost about
$750,000, would contain sufficient space to
isolate communicable disease patients from
the sick and to break down those categories
by sex. The infirmary would care for all
illnesses, except those requiring major
surgery.
THE FIRST floor of the building would
be occupied by Health Service offices, while
the hospital area would be restricted to the
second floor.

Houck expressed the belief that the new
infirmary would go a long way toward hu
manizing Health Service treatment in that
it could provide fuller, more considerate care.
At present, many students feel that treat
ment at the Health Service is incomplete and
impersonal. As a result some students have
lost faith in the Health Service aqd often
joke that no matter what illness they may
have they are always given "sugar pills."
This unfortunate attitude has been caused
generally by the necessity of processing cases
quickly in order to handle the excessive work
load.
HOICK SAID that a special sensitivity on
the part, of the doctors to the patient's feel
ings and worries is required to eliminate this
attitude. At college, he noted, the majority
of the patients are of the same age group
and live under the same conditions of stress.
The college age group, ho pointed out, is
marked by emotional problems with symp
toms that are frightening to the individual
and often by illnesses left over from child
hood. Treatment of these problems, Houck
said, falls somewhere between pediatrics and
general medicine and might be best termed
"hebiatrics," which means adolescent medi
cine.
The physical problems of the college stu

w
dent, he said, require no special training.
What is special is how these problems affeet
the patient, how he views them, and how he
responds to them. Effective treatment must
include sensitivity on the part of the doctor
to these psychological effects.
Houck blasted away a popular belief when
he revealed jokingly that hypocondriacs are
not given special designation on their records.
He noted that this belief has arisen partly
from the fact that the charts of alergy pa
tients are specially marked.
ASIDE FROM making possible an en
larged staff and better treatment, a new in
firmary would also provide the necessary
space for a mental health program to be
headed by a full-time psychiatrist. Also other
functions that are now handled by the Palo
Alto Clinic would be offered by the infirmary,
such as chest X-rays.
Houck emphasized that the new infirmary
is only one of a set of proposals now under
consideration for the expansion of the Health
Service. Once plans are completely formu
lated, they will come up before the admin
istration for a series of discussions and nego
tiations, probably within the next two
months. Viewing the progress of the last 15
years, Houck said he would lie overjoyed if
construction starts in the next three years.

"For the last 1") years since I came here,
my dream has been a new university in
firmary. At your age it is hard to realize
being frustrated for 15 years." So spoke Dr.
(Jeorge flouck, director of the Health Serv
ice. as he outlined to the Daily this week the
pressing need for a new infirmary.
"Plans for an infirmary were first pro-

proposed in the 1920'5, re
vised in the 1930'5, reached
the planning stage in the
1940'5, and began to take
definite shape in the 1950'5"
Houek said.
WITH THE growth of
the undergraduate student
body since World War If, an
infirmary to replace the rest
homes, the isolation hospital
and the present health serv
ice offices has become a

necessity for the welfare and convenience of
the students, he stated.
I-louck reported that when the student
body was much smaller the health service
was able to offer a greater variety of services
on campus and more personalized treatment.
As the Universitv grew, however, the Health

Service became more and more a place where
cases are evaluated and sorted and then often
referred elsewhere for treatment. Some
minor services are still handled on campus,
but many others are offered only at the Palo
Alto Clinic with which the Health Service has
a contract for the provision of services to
Stanford students.
In giving an impression of the size of the
daily workload, Houck said that during the
average day the Health Service handles about
350 cases. Some of these, he pointed out. are
immunizations for the overseas campuses
who should be kept separate from the sick
but who are all handled now in the same
place. This source alone accounts for about
15,000 cases a year.

joke that no matter what illness they may
have they are always given "sugar pills."
This unfortunate attitude has been caused
generally by the necessity of processing cases
quickly in order to handle the excessive work
load.
HOICK SAID that a special sensitivity on
the part, of the doctors to the patient's feel
ings and worries is required to eliminate this
attitude. At college, he noted, the majority
of the patients are of the same age group
and live under the same conditions of stress.
The college age group, ho pointed out, is
marked by emotional problems with symp
toms that are frightening to the individual
and often by illnesses left over from child
hood. Treatment of these problems, Houck
said, falls somewhere between pediatrics and
general medicine and might be best termed
"hebiatrics," which means adolescent medi
cine.
The physical problems of the college stu

w
dent, he said, require no special training.
What is special is how these problems affeet
the patient, how he views them, and how he
responds to them. Effective treatment must
include sensitivity on the part of the doctor
to these psychological effects.
Houck blasted away a popular belief when
he revealed jokingly that hypocondriacs are
not given special designation on their records.
He noted that this belief has arisen partly
from the fact that the charts of alergy pa
tients are specially marked.
ASIDE FROM making possible an en
larged staff and better treatment, a new in
firmary would also provide the necessary
space for a mental health program to be
headed by a full-time psychiatrist. Also other
functions that are now handled by the Palo
Alto Clinic would be offered by the infirmary,
such as chest X-rays.
Houck emphasized that the new infirmary
is only one of a set of proposals now under
consideration for the expansion of the Health
Service. Once plans are completely formu
lated, they will come up before the admin
istration for a series of discussions and nego
tiations, probably within the next two
months. Viewing the progress of the last 15
years, Houck said he would lie overjoyed if
construction starts in the next three years.

"For the last 1") years since I came here,
my dream has been a new university in
firmary. At your age it is hard to realize
being frustrated for 15 years." So spoke Dr.
(Jeorge flouck, director of the Health Serv
ice. as he outlined to the Daily this week the
pressing need for a new infirmary.
"Plans for an infirmary were first pro-

proposed in the 1920'5, re
vised in the 1930'5, reached
the planning stage in the
1940'5, and began to take
definite shape in the 1950'5"
Houek said.
WITH THE growth of
the undergraduate student
body since World War If, an
infirmary to replace the rest
homes, the isolation hospital
and the present health serv
ice offices has become a

necessity for the welfare and convenience of
the students, he stated.
I-louck reported that when the student
body was much smaller the health service
was able to offer a greater variety of services
on campus and more personalized treatment.
As the Universitv grew, however, the Health

Service became more and more a place where
cases are evaluated and sorted and then often
referred elsewhere for treatment. Some
minor services are still handled on campus,
but many others are offered only at the Palo
Alto Clinic with which the Health Service has
a contract for the provision of services to
Stanford students.
In giving an impression of the size of the
daily workload, Houck said that during the
average day the Health Service handles about
350 cases. Some of these, he pointed out. are
immunizations for the overseas campuses
who should be kept separate from the sick
but who are all handled now in the same
place. This source alone accounts for about
15,000 cases a year.
THE PROBLEM in handling such a work
load, Houck said. i« to do a good job of pick
ing out those patients who need more treat
ment than the routine case.
Houck felt that the most immediate need
of the Health Service is to add at least two
more doctors to the present staff of seven.
There would be no problem in finding doc
tors, he said. The only limitation is space.
"Only one thing is adequate," he said,
"and that is my office."
In describing the need for a new infirm
ary, Houck said that the old rest homes are

completely inadequate. The Men's Rest Home
has only 11 beds, while the Women's Rest
Home has nine. He described the Isolation
Hospital, where patients with communicable
diseases are treated, as a "pest hole."
ANOTHER UN DESIRABLE situation has
developed in that pneumonia patients have
to be treated at the rest homes when the Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital is filled.
As Houck envisions it, the new infirmary
would be a two-story building within easy
walking distance of the mall area containing
accommodations for at least 50 patients. This
figure is based on the theory of five hospital
beds for every thousand students with the
size of the student body projected over a
five-year period. Within this time, registra
tion will increase to about 10,000, Houck pre
dicted.
The structure, which would cost about
$750,000, would contain sufficient space to
isolate communicable disease patients from
the sick and to break down those categories
by sex. The infirmary would care for all
illnesses, except those requiring major
surgery.
THE FIRST floor of the building would
be occupied by Health Service offices, while
the hospital area would be restricted to the
second floor.

Houck expressed the belief that the new
infirmary would go a long way toward hu
manizing Health Service treatment in that
it could provide fuller, more considerate care.
At present, many students feel that treat
ment at the Health Service is incomplete and
impersonal. As a result some students have
