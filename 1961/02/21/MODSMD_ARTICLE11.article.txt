## Panel Tells Fairness In Election Coverage 
### JUDY SEABORG 
The news coverage in the 1960 election, agreed a panel headed
by Palmer Hoyt, editor of the Denver Post and Herbert G. Klein, edi
tor of the San Diego Union and Nixon's press secretary during the
1960 campaign, was "fairer than ever before." In spite of the fact
that the majority of the papers took an editorial stand for Nixon,

the news coverage, on the whole,
was "equal and objective."
THE PANEL, which also in
cluded James S. Stone, history
professor, Nathan Maccoby, pro
fessor of communications and
journalism. Alexander Bodi. edi
tor of t lie Palo Alto Times, and
Peter Grotlie, author, journalist,
and political analyst, discussed
"The Responsibility of the Amer
ican Press in Politics." last night
before a sparse gathering in Me
morial Auditorium as part of the
Focus program.
Hoyt opened the program with
remarks concerning the basic
fairness of coverage in the elec
tion. commenting that "to be
fair and candid is good box of
fice." lie said that it "bodes well
for the future of our country that
the newspapers realize that our
people must be informed." His
considered opinion is that "TV is
here to stay, but so is the news
paper."
Klein spoke of "one of the most
important changes in the last few
years interpretive reporting."
This is needed "to help the reader
find the meaning of the news."
THE ONLY danger, he said,
comes when the reporter begins to
insert his own personal opinions.
"There is a new phenomenon."
he commented, "in the live TV
presidential press conference. The
danger is that it allows one party,
through its leader ... to promote
its own point of view." lie con
ceded Kennedy's right to use this
as a powerful medium of pro
moting his own ideas, but felt that
"it is time for the Republicans to
a-sk for equal or at least frequent
time. This is the only way to pie
serve a responsible opposition."
KLEIN commented upon what
lie feels is the inconsistency of the
Kennedy administration in its at
tempting "to declassify informa
tion and then refuse to let nws
paper people talk to the fliers re
cently released by the Russians."
He also spoke of his concern
about "Ilie gag-rule and type
writer curtain being used early in
the administration." which he
felt should lie used only for secur
ity reasons.
(iKOTIIK claimed that Kennedy
has been using TV for the pur
pose of education and felt that
this is "perfectly proper" and that
ho can't be criticized for "wanting
a harmonious administration. The
trouble with the mass media." lie
commented wryly, "is the masses.
They don't wanl or demand
enough politically."
