## Daily Attacks Speech Freedom 
### 
We note with regret that The
Stanford Daily in its Thursday ed
itorial has stooped to the level of
viciously and fallaciously attack
ing freedom of speech and con
science.
Certainly we did not expect
"tears" or "sympathy" for Uni
versity of California ROTC cadet
James L. Creighton. Rather we
expected the Daily to have the
courage and conviction to speak
out rationally and boldly against
this attack on individual liberty.
Totally erroneous is the following
statement from the Daily edi
torial: "The wearing of the uni
form is a symbol that the wearer
has acquiesced to the obedience
that is organic to being a member
of the military." A student at the
University -of California has not

| "acquiesced"—he has been forced
Ito wear the military uniform.
(Basic military training is com
i pulsory at the University of Cali-
I fornia regardless of conscience.)
: If he refuses (as has happened on
previous occasions) he will lose
his right to public university edu
cation in California. His wearing
of a uniform cannot possibly be
equated with the loss of status as
a "private citizen," since one re
mains a civilian until he is com
missioned. Unlike an advanced
ROTC student, the basic cadet re
ceives no pay and enters no con
tract with the military. Apparent
ly the Daily defends not only the
right of the military to control a
student's dress one day a week
but also his thought and actions.
The editor's analogy with a uni
formed policeman "getting drunk
in a neighborhood saloon" is il
logical and belies the Daily's
claim that it upholds the right to
i picket. The comparison ignores
! the fact that membership on the
[police force is voluntary and im
' plies that orderly picketing is on
a moral level with drunkenness.
The Daily goes on to uphold the
j cowardly and unjust manner in
I which Col. Malloy handled the sit
uation. To say that "any uni
[ formed cadets taking part in pick*
j eting, might find difficulty in
passing the course" is pure intim
j idation. Having no legal grounds
I for stopping Mr. Creighton from
| picketing, the officer misused his
! authority as a university instruc
tor by failing the student al-
( though he had fulfilled the course
requirements satisfactorily. Sure
l ly if Col. Calloy had a legal basis
I for his stand, he would have
taken action directly and openly.
The most regrettable part of the
I situation is that The Stanford
• Daily has forsaken its previous
j stand as a defender of democratic
institutions and individual liber
-1 ties. One would at least expect the
( free press of a major university
to speak out on the side of free
dom of speech and conscience. We
i can only hope that the Daily will
j be able to regain the respect of
the democratic community.
