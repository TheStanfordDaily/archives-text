# Africans Support United Nations
## 
### 
In your editorial yesterday, you
tried to create the impression that
our "Pickets showed Jack of
knowledge" with regard to Mr.
Patrice Lumumba and the Congo
lese crisis. Your argument was
that we should not have tied our
case 1o the dead body of Mr. Lu
mumba because "it is the same
dead body the Soviets have seized
upon ... to wreck the United
Nations." Lot me re-affirm, sir,
that the African students who
picketed the Belgian consulate
have the highest regard for the
United Nations. This is precisely
why I deliberately excluded any
criticism of the United Nations in
my statement to the press, of
which you have a copy.
But if your argument is that
we should not have tied our case
to the dead body of Mr. Lumumba
just because the Soviets were also
condemning the tragedy, then I
must charge your paper with po
litical immaturity and naivete.
Carried to its logical conclusion,
your argument would seem to
suggest that we should not. for ex
ample, condemn colonialism be
cause the Soviets also condemn
it. That we should not condemn
Apartheid in South Africa be
cause the Communists also con
demn. Or that we should not con
demn racial segregation lost the
United States thinks we are break
ing away from them in favor of
the Soviet Union.
Having known the Daily for
quite a while now, I hate to think
that you would be guilty of such
a rash statement in your misin
formed editorial.
For the sake of your readers
let me point out lhat rather than
Mr. Lumumba being pro-Commu
nist, the Soviet Union was pro-
Lumumba, and that two state
ments are far from being syn
onomous.
Secondly, whether Mr. Lumum
ba would have deen "a demagogue
and would-be dictator," I am
afraid you have no evidence what
soever to come to such a learned
conclusion. Lumumba headed a
majority party in the Congo and
his three-weeks rule is insuffi
cient data for you to predict on.
Lastly, I would like to suggest to
you that Lumumba was mur
dered "only when the Uniled Na
tions had seemingly settled on a
plan of peace for the Congo," pre
cisely because the "Moise Tshom
bes" and his Belgian "advisors"
knew that if Lumumba was re
leased they would have no voice at
all in the Congo.
It is with the above understand
ing that we decided to picket out
side the Belgian Consulate and
not because we are "like little
boys" or "anti-West" as you sug
gest.

In your editorial yesterday, you
tried to create the impression that
our "Pickets showed Jack of
knowledge" with regard to Mr.
Patrice Lumumba and the Congo
lese crisis. Your argument was
that we should not have tied our
case 1o the dead body of Mr. Lu
mumba because "it is the same
dead body the Soviets have seized
upon ... to wreck the United
Nations." Lot me re-affirm, sir,
that the African students who
picketed the Belgian consulate
have the highest regard for the
United Nations. This is precisely
why I deliberately excluded any
criticism of the United Nations in
my statement to the press, of
which you have a copy.
But if your argument is that
we should not have tied our case
to the dead body of Mr. Lumumba
just because the Soviets were also
condemning the tragedy, then I
must charge your paper with po
litical immaturity and naivete.
Carried to its logical conclusion,
your argument would seem to
suggest that we should not. for ex
ample, condemn colonialism be
cause the Soviets also condemn
it. That we should not condemn
Apartheid in South Africa be
cause the Communists also con
demn. Or that we should not con
demn racial segregation lost the
United States thinks we are break
ing away from them in favor of
the Soviet Union.
Having known the Daily for
quite a while now, I hate to think
that you would be guilty of such
a rash statement in your misin
formed editorial.
For the sake of your readers
let me point out lhat rather than
Mr. Lumumba being pro-Commu
nist, the Soviet Union was pro-
Lumumba, and that two state
ments are far from being syn
onomous.
Secondly, whether Mr. Lumum
ba would have deen "a demagogue
and would-be dictator," I am
afraid you have no evidence what
soever to come to such a learned
conclusion. Lumumba headed a
majority party in the Congo and
his three-weeks rule is insuffi
cient data for you to predict on.
Lastly, I would like to suggest to
you that Lumumba was mur
dered "only when the Uniled Na
tions had seemingly settled on a
plan of peace for the Congo," pre
cisely because the "Moise Tshom
bes" and his Belgian "advisors"
knew that if Lumumba was re
leased they would have no voice at
all in the Congo.
