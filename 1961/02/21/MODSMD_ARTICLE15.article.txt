# Check for Desk
## 
### 
Allow mp to offer through you
a small check for the use of the
African Desk in paying for the ex
cellent supplement enclosed in a
recent Daily. It is not the winter
visit in itself which is of immense
importance, though it was highly
laudable; it is the effect which
that one effort will have all over
our own country, and elsewhere.
As a professor emeritus, I am in
another way grateful to the peo
ple who planned and who took the
Southern trip: long ago. almost
out of memory, the word which
was used for the essential in the
Stanford quality was service
(there was in fact a University
pageant of that name after the
first world war, to honor the work
of our people in and behind the
lines). Of late the term constantly
used in Administration and ASSU
deliberations is success. They are
not synonymous. A fruitfulness
beyond success is likely to result
from the service accomplished by
the African Desk.
