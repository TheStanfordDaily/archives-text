# More Explicit Packard Account
## 
### 
I await a more explicit account |
by Mr. Anderson on the errors of
Vance Packard's ways. In the 1
meantime, certain things seem ob-:
vious.
Advertising has never thrived
as it thrives today. Never has it
had so much power and influence I
on the ways of this nation and its I
people; and yet from no other |
source ran we find the volume of ;
inanity that is thrust upon us
from all sides, day after day, year ;
after year.
True, "Let the buyer beware"
has its relevance. Abuses of the
English language, insults to our
common sense, calculated exploi- j
tation of our weaknesses, and at
tempts to manipulate personal I
values might be excusable were j
it not that through the mass me
dia their influence in the long run ;
may effect the course of the na-1
tion, and adversely so.
But you have an enormous
number of products, and fantastic !
means of getting them accepted
on the market. It works. Why
should you pay attention to Pack
ard's irrelevant considerations of
ethics and long-range conse
quences? Besides, ethics is a mat
ter for philosophers, not men of
practicality.
Let us, then, go forlh to leave'
our scars on the battered world;
and should the roof cave in as we
pull the shoring, we'll blame it on
the Government for not stopping
us.
HANS VON BRTESEN, .TR.
