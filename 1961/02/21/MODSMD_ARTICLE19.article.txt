# Critic Must Know What to Criticize

Your editorial comment on
Vance Packard's Wednesday night
speech must certainly have shown
Mr. Packard and his supporters
wherein lies the fallaciousness of
their reasoning. For it seems a
likely assumption that neither Mr.
Packard nor the proponents of his
views realize that they have yet to
"become aware of the Industrial
Revolution." It is the contention
of your editorial that Mr. Packard
has cited several specific in
stances of harmful "planned ob

solescence" and "demand crea-1
tion" and then gone on from there i
to invalidly "paint a villainous
general picture of industry."
In the first instance, you point
out' Packard's "short-sighted be
lief that a brand-new television is
equal to a five-year-old one." How
ever, if you read several sentences
back in the same paragraph you
will note the irrelevancy of your
comment. The issue is not that
improvements in products are not
useful, worthwhile, or desirable;
it is that products are not made
to last as long as possible. Tele
vision sets, women's nylon stock-!
ings, and automobiles are a small |
but representative sample of tho 112
large class of items whose "life" j
is unnecessarily limited by their
manufacturers. Mr. Packard does
not deny that today's television :
may be better than a 19.">6 model,'
but how does that excuse Ihe fact
that a 1956 model (and perhaps a :
1961 model) needed servicing
within six months of purchaseâ€”
the cost of which nearly equaled |
the purchase price. Certainly, you !
are not suggesting that everyone I
should replace all durable goods, j
all major and minor appliances, !
all articles of clothing each time |
an "improved model" appears on
the market.
In the second instance, you I
speak of Mr. Packard's "assump
tion that all created desires are
hoaxes." From that you infer
that he should logically regard the
radio, automobile, etc., as a hoax.
Mr. Packard is speaking (as does
J. K. Galbraithi of artificial de
mand creation. He does not mean
to imply that everything that was
once unknown and, therefore, was j
not specifically demanded <an as
sertion the truth of which is by
no means obvious) is thrust for
ward at the consumer and eagerly
grabbed by him thus completing
the great hoax. What he does ob
ject to are tail fins and the in
numerable types of deodorants:
unnecessary products, and unnec
essary product variations.
If you ask what harm all this
has, the answer is this: Capital,
labor, and energy are being wast
ed. At the same time, many pub
lic, social needs are unattended.
If one car will last the life of five,
then the effort required 1o pro
duce the other four may he ap
plied to housing, schools, raising
the social minimum, research, etc.
Mr. Packard's statements are not
beyond criticism, but before this
can be done the critic must under
stand what he is criticizing.
