# Crothers RA's Say Houck Distorted Food Poison Facts
## 
### 
Two resident assistants from Crothers and Crothers Memorial
and the president of Crothers last night accused Dr. George Houck,
director of the Health Service, of whitewashing the story of the
Encina food poisoning episode.
John S. Chapman, Crothers RA, James Dort, Crothers Memorial

RA, and Phil Maroot, president
of Crothers, said Houck presented
a one-sided, distorted account.
THEY ALSO protested the fact
that blame had been assigned to
them for part af the delay in medi
cal attention the night when
nearly 100 Crothers residents fell
ill with food poisoning.
According to the three, they fol
lowed emergency procedure ex
actly as it was outlined to them
at the beginning of the year.
Houck, in a statement to the
Daily, held the RA's blameless.
! "I place no blame on the RA's
whatsoever," he said. "1 have
nothing but praise for their ac
t ions."
DIVAN WILLIAM Craig also
stood behind the RA's. "The RA's
in question were familiar with the
procedures established for emer
gency situations and to the best
of my knowledge followed the
proper procedures. In my opinion,
after investigation, the RA's act
ed responsibly and effectively."
Frederic Glover, Executive As
sistant to the President, said that
the RA's followed procedure ex
actly as il had been outlined to
them by the administration. He
felt, however, that perhaps their
instructions had been incomplete
as a result of negligence on the
part of the administration. The
RA's, he said, could have phoned
various administration offices,
including the police and fire de
partment if they had been so in
structed.
Maroot also protested thai yes
terday's Daily article made him
appear a liar. He had been quoted
as saying that Houck refused to
send help when called. Houck had
previously denied outright refus
ing to respond to the call.
Contacted last night, Houck
qualified his previous denial. "I
have no memory of refusing to
come. I don't believe I did. I'm
not entirely sure."
CHAPMAN, nOKT, and Ma
root were highly critical of the
medical judgment of the doctor
on duty at the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital. Throughout most of the
evening, they said, the doctor per
sisted in diagnosing the outbreak
as flu rather than food poisoning.
They also questioned the validity
of any diagnosis made over the
, phone on the basis of laymen's ob
i servations.
The three differed with Houck
on the matter of the seriousness
' of the food poisoning. Houck had
, described it as mild and not seri
ous. Many students were unable
to attend classes the next day and
some suffered after effects for
several davs. they reported.
