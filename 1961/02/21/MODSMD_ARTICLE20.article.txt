# Foreigners Not Rushing Tactic
## 
### 
We are sorry that our letter
was intevpreted by various mem
bers of the eating clubs as a "rush
ing tactic," for this is far astray
of our purpose. We had no inten
tion whatsoever of using the for
eign students as a political foot
ball, but merely wished to point
out this worthy activity to the stu
dent body and in particular the
freshman class.
If our critics feel that we said
the foreign student programs are
"an attraction peculiarly inherent
in Stanford fraternity life," they
have misread our article. It was
pointed out quite clearly that the
eating clubs have participated in
the foreign student programs, and
we condone their excellent work.
Several women's living groups are
included in these programs.
We arc not here concerned with
the ASSU Foreign Scholarship
Program. Our interest was in and
remains in enlarging upon the
residence international experience
of every, whatever its past accom
plishments. There is always room
for improvement. Consequently,
in our earlier letter we drew at
tention to the most under-devel
oped area on campus: namely, the
fraternities. It was our hope to
awaken enthusiasm for this wor
thy program, not only on the Row,
but on the rest of the campus as
well.
