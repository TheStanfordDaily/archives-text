Your editorial of Feb. 16 in
censed me. You have overlooked
the most disturbing element of
the Creighton incident while dis
torting by a poor choice of terms
less important elements.
For instance, you stated that
Mr. Creighton "desecrated this
uniform by campaigning against
it while wearing it." First of all,
picketing to end com p u Is ory
ROTC can in no way be construed
as campaigning "against" the
United States Army. It makes no
more difference that Mr. Creigh
ton wore his uniform while picket
ing than It would have mattered
if he had worn his fraternity pin
(assuming that he belongs to a
fraternity) while denouncing the
segregationist policies of certain
national fraternities. The word
"desecrate" denotes connotations
grossly unjust in the context of
the situation.
Finally, and most important,
Col. Malloy, when asked if he be
lieved that any cadet who believed
in optional ROTC should receive
a grade of "P," replied: "That's
one way of putting it." Though
Mr. Creighton was forewarned,
though in a rather unofficial man
ner, he is being punished here—
and severly—for his thoughts, not
simply his actions. The army
must be allowed, at least, the dig
nity of their own opinions.
