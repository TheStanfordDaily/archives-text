The confidence of the Stanford
community, often shaken during
the administration of former
Daily Editor Barry Greenberg,
has been restored by your edi
torial of Feb. lfi concerning Uni
versity of California student
Creighton.
Mr. Creighton, apparently one
of those damn average raisers,
was given a failing grade for
participating in a demonstration
against compulsory militarism in
an academic institution while
wearing his uniform. In applaud
ing that sanction you state cor
rectly (if rather redundantly).
"The question of the right to
picket is not the question . .
Former Editor Green berg
would have agreed with that
proposition but, being a radical,
he would have gone farther. He
would have insisted that the ques
tion was not whether some appro
priate sanction might have been
invoked against Mr. Creighton
but whether a grade, properly
used only to reflect academic
achievement (or lack thereof),
ought to be used for a purpose
bearing no relation to academic
achievement.
The grey flannel thinking of the
present editorial writer has en
abled him to avoid any such sub
versive nonsense.
