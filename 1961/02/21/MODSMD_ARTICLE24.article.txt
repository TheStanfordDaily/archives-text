# Navy Academic?
## 
### 
While the University Admin
! istration cannot ho expected to be
| composed entirely of pacifists and
l radicals, one would expect.them to
try to create an academic spirit in
! the University. Allowing govern

ment propaganda on the Engi
neering Corner last Friday was
not consistent with this ideal. The
i Navy has po more in common
with the intellect than Disneyland
'or the Peninsula Creamery, and
surely they would not he allowed
to set up shop on Quad. So why
allow the Navy? The Administra

tion is to be condemned for its
lack of taste in allowing the Navy
to park their eyesore anywhere
near Quad.
