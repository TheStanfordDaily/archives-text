# Solid opportunities with solid state devices

### 
A big part of Western Electric's job is to manu
facture the miniature "new arts" products that
are changing the science of communications.
It's a job which offers you a challenging career
—a chance to plan new methods of mass pro
ducing ever-improving kinds of transistors, fer
rite devices, diodes, special purpose electron
tubes, etc.
You'll be with a company that is expanding
rapidly in this field. At present our Allentown
and Laureldale, Pa., plants are devoted exclu
sively to making electron devices, and a big
new plant is under construction in Kansas
Citv. The needs of the Bell Telephone System
for these products are increasing daily and
will multiply enormously with the introduc
tion of Electronic Central Office switching
now nearing trial operation.
These devices are changing the scene at all
our manufacturing plants as they go into the
startling new communications products devel
oped by our associates at Bell Telephone
Laboratories. From microwave transmission

equipment to submarine cable amplifiers, our
products call for creative production engineer
ing, installation planning, and merchandising
methods. Our job for the Hell System and the
U.S. government has grown to the point where
we are now one of the nation's "Top 1 1 in
industrial sales. And your chance to play an
important part in our future growth is solid!
Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, indus
trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. For more
information, get your copy of Consider a Career at
Western Electric from your Placement Officer. Or write
