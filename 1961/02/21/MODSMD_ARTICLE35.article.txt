# Very unusual

### 
Tory TTA is the first of a series of test reactors
being developed under the Lawrence Radiation
Laboratory's nuclear ramjet program.
A reactor for ramjet propulsion must operate
at high power levels yet l>e of minimum si/e
and mass. Its design must consider the very high
pressure drop across its length, the stress loads
due to flight maneuvering, and the extremely

high radiation flux level which itself leads tc
severe heat transfer and radiation damage prob
lems. Because the operating temperature exceeds
that at which most conventional structural ma
terials fail, the core itself consists <»112 bundled
tubes of sintered uranium and beryllium oxidt
fabricated with central holes for continuous aii
passage.

One of many unusual projects at tlie
h Lawrence Radiation Laboratory — the only
national laboratory active in virtually all
I phases of the atomic energy program.
ON FEBRUARY 24

about a career in nuclear research.
They will interview outstanding:
