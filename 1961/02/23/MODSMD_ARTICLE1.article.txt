## 
### 
Skillful pinball machine playing has netted cash prizes for seven
Stanford men, while supplying information for a Psychology Depart
ment study.
Top winners and scores are: Peter Peterson, S2OO grand prize, with
6,740,000; Dick Norton, SlOO, with 5,730,000; Brad Freeman, S5O,

THE PSYCH Department began
advertising Jan. 13 for 200 under-1
graduate men who wanted to play
pinball machines for a $200 prize. :
On the basis of ten contest games i
the top seven scorers were cho
sen. Since the top four players i
all got the maximum score of
eight million plus, their second
best scores were utilized to deter-1
mine the final ranking.
The purpose of the contest was ;
to determine how much risk the 1
players would take with the im
position of various penalties for
tilting, revealed Marcia Braden,
graduate student in psychology,
who supervised all 200 players.
EACH PARTICIPANT was al
lowed five practice games and j
then drew a slip for a penalty (the 1
major variable in the experiment > j
which would be invoked for tilt- !
ing. Equal numbers of four pen
alties, varying in degree, were
available.
Deduction of 50,000 points from
the top score for each game in
which the machine was tilted was j
the mildest penalty, followed by]
250,000 and one million point de-1
duct ions. The severest penalty j
was "sudden death" or a com-!
plete disqualification at the first ;
tilt. With previous knowledge of'
these penalties, the men then
played ten contest games.
Unknown to the players at the;
time, there were two tilt mecha- j
nisms. First the mechanism de- i
tecting tilting machine was very
insensitive so some tilting was
allowed without incurring a pen-1
alty. A very sensitive counting !
mechanism was also attached to j
the machine to measure the |
"push" they gave their machines'
but it had no influence on their i
scoring.
THE PURPOSE of the practice!
games was to allow the experi
menters to measure the normal i
"push" of the player in order to ,
be able to detect any variance af- j
ter the imposition of penalties.
The penalties did not seem to j
curtail the scoring very much, for !
three of the seven winners were
in the most severe penalty cate
gory, while three were in the mild
est and one in the 250,000 division.
Previous experience did not seem
to affect the scoring much either,
and non-players seemed to have
almost as good a chance to win
as "sharks."
