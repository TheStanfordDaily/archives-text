## All Is Lost? ’Don't Count on It’—Fire Dept. 
### RANDY MILLEN 
Lost, strayed or stolen: four dozen pairs of eyeglasses
... a dozen and a half ballpoint pens ... a dozen and
a half watches . . . two dozen keys . . . and a half
dozen pairs of gloves.
Looking for any one (or more) of these items? AH
may he found at the Stanford fire house. Or at the BAG.
| Or at any one of tlvo University offices.
Till; HKAQUARTKKS for Stanford's lost-and-found
is the fire house supposedly. But many departments
j maintain their own lost-and-found services. Thus, some
; times things kept at a department for a while tnay ho
turned over to the fiiv house; sometimes llh> department
will keep them for a period of indeterminate length.
In addition, the Board of Athletic Control has a lost
i and-found service of its own, for all items picked up on
territory under its control the football stadium, base
| ball diamond, gym, etc.
According to Assistant Fire Chief Frank Jurian,
I "There may be advantages in this system, and there
may be disadvantages. We at the fire department think
the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. We
should like to see a centralized lost-and-found."
FOB KXAMI'Ii; he pointed out, a student might
lose a book in Memorial Auditorium and, not knowing
that Mem Aud has a lost-and-found department of its
own, might come to the fiit? house for two or three
weeks running.
After the third week, when he doesn't find it there,
he may stop looking for it. And when it finally does
arrive al the fire house, there is no way of getting in
| touch with him.
Jurian emphasized, however, that if there is any
I mark nl identification on the lost, article, the fire de

partment will spare no pains in attempting to find the
owner.
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT took over the lost-and
found in 1947 for reasons of practicality. They are open
24 hours a day, seven days a week, and there always is
someone on duty.
"You can come in any time from 8 iti the morning to
,1 or half past 5 at night," Jurian said, "and phone in
until 10 o'clock."
What happens to a typical lost item? Let us surmise
that a student loses a wristwatch at History Corner the
first week of winter quarter. The watch is picked up by
a janitor and taken to the department secretary, who
puts it into the department lost-and-found. where it stays
until the end of the quarter.
AT THE BEGINNING of spring quarter, if the stu
dent hasn't claimed it.it is shipped over to the fire house
along with two or three other boxfuls of stuff that have
been accumulating during the quarter.
The watch arrives. As it is an article of value, it is
registered on file cards, along with the name and address
of the finder. Then it is put into a lit lie envelope and
placed in a box in the lost-and-found closet.
There is stays for 90 days, during which the owner
may come to pick il up. After 90 days, if no one has
claimed it, the original finder is notified and may take
it as his or her own. If he or she does not, the watch (or
bracelet, pen, pair of gloves, textbook > is kept for nine
months making one year, in all, that the fire house has
had it.
NOW IT IS SPRING of the following year. All lost
and-found items are sorted, and those that have been
there for 12 months are given to the Convalescent
Home to be sold in a fund-raising auction at its spring
lest ival.

Books arc the only goods that do not go to the Con
Home; they are given to Alpha Phi Omega for its used
book sales. (Although, Jurian notes, recently A Phi O
men haven't been coming around to pick up the books.)
What kinds of articles are lost around campus? Pens,
pins, rings, watches, cameras, books and binders mostly.
"We don't got too much clothing," said Jurian. "Mostly
it's things like gloves, scarves, Stanford jackets.
"But one thing \vc get a lot of, and that's glasses.
Sometimes we've had maybe 70 to 80 pairs of glasses
lying up there. And it seems like nobody ever comes in
to claim them. I guess they just figure glasses are lost
forever. But they aren't. Many of them come here.
"WK'VK FOUND people pretty honest, by and largo,"
he continued. "For example, a few years ago there was
this fellow who lost $100 in cash along Palm Drive. He
had cashed a check on registration, and was carrying
the money in an envelope. The envelope with the money
in it was brought in to us intact."
Jurian emphasized that the fire house keeps no rec
ord of articles lost only articles found.
There is also one other lost-and-found department
in campus, Jurian said, and that is the one at the police
department. "They handle anything that has to do with
motor vehicles, bicycles, and the like. We have the sys
tem set up if somebody brings us a hubcap, we take it
over there; if somebody turns a wallet or a notebook
in to them, they'll bring it to us."
SCATTERED AM) far-flung as it is, the campus lost
and-found system, with its (nominal) headquarters at
the fire house, seems to do a respectable job of recover
ing lost property .and returning it to its owners, or. at
least, of disposing of it in a way beneficial to society. The
men ;tt the fire house do wonders to make the system
work ;is well as it dot s.
