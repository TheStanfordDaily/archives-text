# Subcontracts Let For Project M-- Total 600 G's
## 
### 
Work totalling $600,000 has been authorized for Project M under
subcontracts awarded to Radio Corporation of America and Sperry
Gyroscope Company for research and development of pilot model
components to be used with the proposed two-mile Stanford linear
electron accelerator.
Both firms were successful bidders for pilot development of the

| 24-million-watt klystron amplifier
| tubes which will power the big
! atom smasher. RCA also received
I a subcontract for development ,of
its power supply modulator sys-
I tern.
THE cost - plus - fixed - fee con
tracts cover some of the prelimi
nary design and development
work on the proposed $100 million
project for which Congress appro
; priated $3 million last fall for the
I present work, which is being car
ried out by Stanford under the
I prime contract with the Atomic
! Energy Commission.
i If full Congressional approval
; is given, the accelerator could be
j finished in about six years and
I would generate 10-20 billion elec
-1 tron volts (BEV).
Under their subcontracts, Sperry
and RCA each will deliver six
super-power klystron amplifiers
before the end of this year. The
tubes will incorporate improve
ments on basic Stanford klystron
designs.
Specifications call for 6 to 24
megawatts peak output, mini
mum life of 2,000 hours, and
mass - production, easy - mainte
nance design. The finished accel
erator would use 240 klystrons.
MICROWAVE power from the
klystrons would drive electrons
through the accelerator's 4-inch,
10,00()-foot-long pipe at approxi
mately the speed of light. Gain
ing tremendous energy in the
form of increasing mass, the elec
| trons would be sent crashing into
nuclear targets at the end of the
pipe.
Physicists predict the resulting
collisions could produce all known
particles of matter and might cre
ate new ones.
Other uses of the accelerator
would include studies of secon
dary particle produtcion proc
esses, of possible limits to the
theories of quantum electro-dy
namics, and the measurement of
nuclear structures.
THE existing 1-BEV Stanford
yielded the most accurate known
measurements of the si/e and
charge distribution of neutrons
and protons, Ihe basic particles
that make up all nuclei.
RCA's power supply modulator
system would be used in con
junction with the klystrons to ap
ply microwave power to the speed
ing electrons. Under the present
subcontract, modulator work is
authorized up to $300,000 by
June 30. Additional work may
bring the total cost to approxi
mately $450,000.
Under the subcontract with
! RCA for klystrons, $150,000 has
! been authorized until June 30 and
$150,000 for the same period for
Sperry. An additional $200,000 is
{estimated for completion of the
I two klystron subcontracts.
