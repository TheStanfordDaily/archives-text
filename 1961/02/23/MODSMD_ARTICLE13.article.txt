# Infirmary Must Top Building Priority List
## 
### 
In the days since the Encina food poisoning case the Adminis
tration has moved to remove the circumstances which led to the
bungling of the emergency that Saturday night. The doctors at
the Health Service have been instructed to respond immediately
to calls for medical care by Resident Advisors. The Dean's office
has taken steps to insure the presence of at least one Dean who
can be reached by phone (that Saturday night they were all attend
ing a conference in Santa Barbara). The phone operator at the
Health Service has been told to put through calls to Dr. Houck,
if any Resident Advisor wants to speak to him. And last, the Resi
dent Advisors have been informed that they are to call the Police
or Fire Department if medical aid is not forthcoming immediately.
It is doubtful whether the RA's will ever have to call the police
with these precautions in effect. The President's office has moved
swiftly and efficiently to set up these safeguards and is to be com
mended for doing so.
Praise cannot be lavished, however, on the Administration's
constant disregard of the pleas of the Health Center for more and
better facilities on campus. Many of the widespread student com
plaints over the Health Service's lack of consideration and over-fast
diagnosing can be traced to the fact that there are simply not enough
doctors. Dr. Houck has said that he could add at least two more
doctors to his staff, but has no place to put them in the current Health
Service building, which was built to treat 500 women students in
the early days of the University. In addition a full-time psychiatrist
is needed to handle what is, at present, an overloaded schedule for
the psychiatrist's staff at the Palo Alto Clinic.
J
Adeguate physical facilities are needed, however, before the
staff can be beefed up. At present, the Isolation Hospital is a fire
trap, as well' as being insufficient to handle any sort of epidemic
on this campus. Yet, even a more startling revelation is that the
Health Service had been forced to treat serious illnesses such as
pneumonia in the dormitories or in the Rest Homes because the
Stanford-Palo Alto Hospital had been filled up and had no beds!
available for Stanford students.
A look at these facts is enough to make one realize that the ;
Administration should act. On some of the more minor of the items,
such as getting a psychiatrist on campus, there is no reason why
he has to be in the Health Service building.
The infirmary building situation presents itself as more formid
able, especially since the Administration has long put a new in
firmary, which would combine the facilities now provided by the
Health Service, the Rest Homes, and Isolation Hospital into one
building, toward the bottom of their priority list. The disclosures
from the Health Service serve notice that this low priority should
be movedâ€”to very near the top.
