## Advocates Measures to Eliminate Negro Ghettos in Northern Cities 
### 
Should our present state affairs
continue, Ihe North will soon have
more segregated schools than the
South.
School segregation is often
merely the result of another prob
lem—housing. If a school is lo
cated in an all-Negro neighbor
hood, nothing can result but an
all-Negro school. Once we realize
segregated schools, stores and
playgrounds come into existence
because we force minority groups
into ghettos, we question, what
can be done?
THE ANSWER is simple; elimi-

Nat e restricted
neighborhoods.
I can hear tract
housewives yell
ing about prop
erty values now.
They're pro-inte
gration (aren't
we all), but this
is a simple mat
ler of logical eco
nomics. Or is it?
There's a man

by the name of Eichler who thinks
it is. He builds tracts in Menlo
Park and surrounding areas. And
he sells them to anyone who can
pay for them, be they black,
white, or green with antennas.
And he makes money. So do the
people who buy his homes, as each
subdivision sees the same type
house going up in market value.
EICHLER IS an exception; yet
for the most part, the middle-class
whites flee 1o pure suburbia,
while the Negroes remain in cen
ter city slums. Cities, San Fran
cisco being a current example, un
dertake slum clearance projects
which replace the lower-class
dwellings with apartments far be
yond the price range that can be
afforded by Negro families. So
the Negroes fly into the next bor
der area, with each successive
residential group moving one
notch away from the city, the
white middle-class finally turning
to the outlying suburban areas.
SLUM clearance isn't working;
racial make-up remains the same,
with only the geography changing
a bit.
It is ridiculous to believe that
only the whites can afford the
outlying tract homes, yet only the
whites move into them.
Reconstruction projects under
taken by the cities haven't served
to provide all Americans with an
equal amount of "life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness." Cities
didn't succeed with school integra
tion. It wasn't until the federal
government stepped in that it be
gan to become a reality. It's about
time to see some action on hous
ing.
WHAT CAN the federal govern
ment do? A builder needs a license
to begin work. Governmrnt en
forcement of non-discriminatory
practices would make it necessary
for him to open his homes to all
who could afford them, or be for
bidden to place them on the mar
ket.
A real estate broker also needs
a license to operate. How many
brokers would work with a multi
ple listing that said "whites only"
if he could lose his license for it?
I Last Wednesday the Senate ap

proved Robert Weaver, a Negro,
as director of the nation's housing
program.
PRESIDENT Kennedy certain
ly knew what he was doing with
this nomination.
It will only be a short step from
integrated housing, to rulings that
any firm or organization using
government funds or power to
operate such as air lines, public
utilities, schools, defense plants,
must be non-discriminatory or
lose their support. With all living
in the same neighborhood, work
ing in the same plant, schools
would be a very minor issue.
Their integration evolving quite

naturally.
THE ONLY thing that could
stop the realization of this demo
cratic ideal would be concerted
action by white, middle-class
bigots.
We sneer when we see pictures
of Southern housewives blocking
Negro 6-year-olds from entering a
schoolroom, yet we piously move
into homes with restrictive
clauses.
Unless something is done about
housing, there will be more Negro
schools in the North than in the
South.
The next move is yours, Mr.
Weaver.

more segregated schools than the
South.
School segregation is often
merely the result of another prob
lem—housing. If a school is lo
cated in an all-Negro neighbor
hood, nothing can result but an
all-Negro school. Once we realize
segregated schools, stores and
playgrounds come into existence
because we force minority groups
into ghettos, we question, what
can be done?
THE ANSWER is simple; elimi-

Nat e restricted
neighborhoods.
I can hear tract
housewives yell
ing about prop
erty values now.
They're pro-inte
gration (aren't
we all), but this
is a simple mat
ler of logical eco
nomics. Or is it?
There's a man

by the name of Eichler who thinks
it is. He builds tracts in Menlo
Park and surrounding areas. And
he sells them to anyone who can
pay for them, be they black,
white, or green with antennas.
And he makes money. So do the
people who buy his homes, as each
subdivision sees the same type
house going up in market value.
EICHLER IS an exception; yet
for the most part, the middle-class
whites flee 1o pure suburbia,
while the Negroes remain in cen
ter city slums. Cities, San Fran
cisco being a current example, un
dertake slum clearance projects
which replace the lower-class
dwellings with apartments far be
yond the price range that can be
afforded by Negro families. So
the Negroes fly into the next bor
der area, with each successive
residential group moving one
notch away from the city, the
white middle-class finally turning
to the outlying suburban areas.
SLUM clearance isn't working;
racial make-up remains the same,
with only the geography changing
a bit.
It is ridiculous to believe that
only the whites can afford the
outlying tract homes, yet only the
whites move into them.
Reconstruction projects under
taken by the cities haven't served
to provide all Americans with an
equal amount of "life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness." Cities
didn't succeed with school integra
tion. It wasn't until the federal
government stepped in that it be
gan to become a reality. It's about
time to see some action on hous
ing.
WHAT CAN the federal govern
ment do? A builder needs a license
to begin work. Governmrnt en
forcement of non-discriminatory
practices would make it necessary
for him to open his homes to all
who could afford them, or be for
bidden to place them on the mar
ket.
A real estate broker also needs
a license to operate. How many
brokers would work with a multi
ple listing that said "whites only"
if he could lose his license for it?
I Last Wednesday the Senate ap

proved Robert Weaver, a Negro,
as director of the nation's housing
program.
PRESIDENT Kennedy certain
ly knew what he was doing with
this nomination.
It will only be a short step from
integrated housing, to rulings that
any firm or organization using
government funds or power to
operate such as air lines, public
utilities, schools, defense plants,
must be non-discriminatory or
lose their support. With all living
in the same neighborhood, work
ing in the same plant, schools
would be a very minor issue.
Their integration evolving quite

naturally.
THE ONLY thing that could
stop the realization of this demo
cratic ideal would be concerted
action by white, middle-class
bigots.
We sneer when we see pictures
of Southern housewives blocking
Negro 6-year-olds from entering a
schoolroom, yet we piously move
into homes with restrictive
clauses.
Unless something is done about
