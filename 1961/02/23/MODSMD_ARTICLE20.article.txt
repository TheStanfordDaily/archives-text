### WARREN SCHLOAT 
The varsity swimmers, in a
warm-up for USC, captured nine
out of 10 first places in defeating
Menlo J.C., 65-21. Tuesday in a
dual meet in the Men's Pool.
According to Coach Jim Gaugh
ran, the 400-yard medley relay
team made up of Tom Redfern,
Paul Hait, John Jurgensen and
Mike Zeller has a good chance to
win their event in the NCAA
championships on March 24 and
25 at the University of Washing
ton.
THE RELAY team's best time
this year has been a very respect
able 3:46.1 against USC-defending
national champions at Berkeley
last Saturday.
Last year at the NCAA cham
pionships Indiana set the Ameri
can and collegiate record for the
medley relay at 3:40.9. with run
nerup USC clocked at 3:45.7.
Coach Gaughran, noting that
each man hadn't swum his best
time, felt that four and five sec
onds could easily be clipped off
by the NCAA finals.
THIS YEAR due to scholastic
ineligibility, the Indiana team will
not be able to compete, and since
the Cards boat the Trojans, an
excellent chance is in the offing
for Stanford to win the medley
relay championship and possibly
set a national record.

Mike Zeller has a good chance to
win their event in the NCAA
championships on March 24 and
25 at the University of Washing
ton.
THE RELAY team's best time
this year has been a very respect
able 3:46.1 against USC-defending
national champions at Berkeley
last Saturday.
Last year at the NCAA cham
pionships Indiana set the Ameri
can and collegiate record for the
medley relay at 3:40.9. with run
nerup USC clocked at 3:45.7.
Coach Gaughran, noting that
each man hadn't swum his best
time, felt that four and five sec
onds could easily be clipped off
by the NCAA finals.
THIS YEAR due to scholastic
ineligibility, the Indiana team will
not be able to compete, and since
the Cards boat the Trojans, an
excellent chance is in the offing
for Stanford to win the medley
relay championship and possibly
set a national record.
