### 
LOS ANGELES (UPI)— Billy
Donovan, the cherub-faced coach
of Loyola of Los Angeles, thinks
Tom Meschery of St. Mary's i«
the best player his club has faced
all year, better even than South
ern California's John Rudometkin.
Speaking before the weekly
basketball writer's luncheon here
Monday Donovan said of Mes
chery, "If he pets the ball, it's in
the hoop. That's all."
The Lions lost to St. Mary's
Saturday night, thus lowing the
West Coast Conference lead to
L'SF.

"MESC'HKRY is the best basket
ball player we've played against
this year," Donovan said. "He
does everything too easy. He's
not afraid of anybody."
Comparing him to Rudometkin,
who is leading the Big Five in
scoring, Donovan said Meschery
is a« good or almost as good on
offense and better in the other de
partments.
Forrest Twogood of SC said his
team's game with Washington at
Seattle Saturday night was "the
roughest basketball I've ever seen
since I've been at SC."

He told the writers that guard
Neil Edwards now has a groin in
jury to add to his tender broken
finger and will doubtless miss this
weekend'* games in Oregon. "It
takes a quarter-mile of tape to
get him ready," Towgie said.
UCLA'S John Wooden, whose
15th tanked Bruins beat Loyola of
Chicago but lost by one point to
Kentucky last weekend, said his
team "played real well."
Bill Jlevnen of Los Angeles
State and Johnny Given of UCLA
were named co-players of the
week by the writers.
