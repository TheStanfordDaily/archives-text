# Injuries Force Card Boxers To Drop Tilts
## 
### PETE CRAWFORD 
Stanford has been forced to
forfeit its boxing meet with Cal
Thursday night due to injuries to
•some members of the Card team.
This unfortunate problem has
also resulted in the cancellation
of the Indian's meet with Fresno
State Saturday night.
IN THE 139-lb. division both
Jeff Tompkins and John Minaletti
are unable to start. Jeff was
forced to retire due to a heavy
academic load, and John's injury
will keep him out for the rest of
the season.
At light-heavyweight T a 11 on
Ray suffered an injured ear drum
and is unable to fight at this time.
Ed Rothman planned then to
move into this division leaving Ed
Cummings as heavyweight. Cum
mings, however, injured his hand
and is out for the season.
This leaves Stanford in the po
sition of having to forfeit 132, 139,
16fj and 178. For this reason inter
collegiate competition has been
suspended.
THIS is AN unfortunate break
for the Cards who had easily won
their first two matches against
Cal Poly and Santa Clara.
Their loss last week to Chico j
State was the result to a large
extent of the crippled condition
of the team and eliminated Stan-J
ford's hopes for- an undefeated'

'season.
The Stanford loam will partici-
I pate as individuals in tho Navy
Invitational March 1. It is hoped
that Stanford will ho able to op
pose Cal March 8 at Berkeley.
