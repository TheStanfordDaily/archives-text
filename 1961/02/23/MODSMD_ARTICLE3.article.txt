Arc teaching machines efficient I
k nowledge-d ispensers ?
The answer to this question and
some others in the field of edu
cation will be sought by Stan
ford's newly founded Laboratory
for Quantitative Research in Edu
cation.
STANFORD'S strengths in the
application of mathematical meth
ods to ihe social sciences will fo
cus on education through the lab
oratory.
LABORATORY headquarters is
in Sequoia Hall temporarily until
a new office building is construct
ed in the vicinity of Sequoia Hall
adjacent to the Science Quad.
In addition to the study of j
teaching machines, the laboratory
staff will also investigate five
other related fields:
Mathematical learning theory
and its application to education
problems;
Evaluation of courses and tech
niques in teaching by mathemati
cal methods;
Application of learning theory!
to language and mathematical in
struction; and application ot man
agement science to school admin
istration.
