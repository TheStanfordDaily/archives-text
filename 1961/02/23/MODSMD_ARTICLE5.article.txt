# Hoyt: Education Main Press Responsibility
## 
### FRANCES FISHER Assistant Managing' Editor 
"Freedom of the press should
not be considered a publisher's
license, but the people's right to
know," stated Palmer Hoyt. edi
tor of the Denver Post, Tuesday
night, in his remarks opening the
second Focus panel discussion on
"The Responsibility of the Ameri
can Press."
Hoyt, who also took part in
Monday night's panel, spoke in
place of William F. Knowland who
was unable to attend the discus
sion because of a bad case of the
flu.
Other members of the panel
were moderator David Levin, Eng
lish professor; Barry Green berg,
former editor of The Stanford
Daily, and John Lofton, editorial
writer on leave from the Pitts
burgh Gazette.
"IT IS THE job of the news
paper to keep people informed,"
asserted Hoyt, emphasizing that
in this time of crisis it is crucial
that the people know what they
are up against.
Newspaper responsibility in ed
ucating the public is extremely
important since "the newspapers
are still the number one medium
of adult education."
A job needing special attention
of the press at the present time is
the job of insuring the continu
ance of the two-party system,
Hoyt stated. "The Republicans
must be more progressive or they
will not continue to exist" said
Hoyt. He continued that it is the
job of the newspaper to point out
the vast differences between po
litical thinking of various people
and groups.

C ONCERNING the subject of
headlines in newspapers, Hoyt !
stated "Headlines are the cause
of most trouble and misunder-1
standing, and criticism of news- j
papers. I
As an example of poor head
line writing, Hoyt cited the San
Francisco Examiner which termed
the Stanford-Cal after-game scuf
fle as a "riot" in a banner head- j
line, yet did not even include the i
incident in the lead paragraph of)
the story about the game.
LOFTON presented the panel
with the problem of the lack of
political objectivity in American
news coverage and suggested that
perhaps if an intensive study of
the performance of the press dur
ing political campaigns were un
taken, the study would help to
make the press more responsible.
Lofton pointed out the biased
news coverage in many papers,
emphasizing particularly the po
litical bias of the San Diego
Union, the editor of which is;
Herbert G. Klein who spoke at J
the panel discussion Monday night i
in Memorial Auditorium.
