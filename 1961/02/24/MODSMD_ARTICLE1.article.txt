# Nixon to Replace Sterling? Rumor Emphatically Denied
## Liberal Professors Ready to Pack As Commotion Sweeps Campus 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
"I nearly flipped!"
Thus did one professor neatly sum up reaction on campus yester
day to the Los Angeles newspaper report that former vice president
Richard M. Nixon was in line to replace Stanford President Wallace
Sterling.
The article, published under huge headline type on page one of
Wednesday's Los Angeles Herald-1

Express, said Nixon was slated
for a top executive post at Stan
ford.
REACTION and complete denial
came swiftly from all parts of
Stanford officialdom, and yester
day from Nixon himself.
In a telegram to Sterling, Nixon
declared "No one could have been
more surprised than I when I
was informed of press reports
speculating that I might be named
President of Stanford. As you of
course know, there is no founda
tion in fact whatever for these re
ports. No one has discussed with
me or with any member of my
staff even the possibility of my
taking such a position."
And Thomas P. Pike, president
of I he University's Board of Trus
tees and Nixon's California cam
paign manager during the presi
dential campaign also denied the
report.
"THE STORY is totally un
founded," he said in a statement
yesterday."The appointment of
a president is the responsibility
solely of the Trustees and I can
state without qualification that
nothing of the sort suggested by
the Herald-Express has been con
sidered.
"The trustees are enthusiastic
about the achievements of Dr.
Sterling in his 11 years as presi
dent, and anticipate even greater
accr mplishments under his leader
ship in the years ahead.
But while it was alive, the ru
mor did kick up quite a commotion
on campus. Tne Daily, which car
ried no story yesterday because
ihe paper had been put to press
Tuesday night flue to technical
reasons arising from the holiday,
received at least 50 phone calls
between 1 p.m. and 11 p.m.
Wednesday.
IT ALE began when United
Press International phoned and
wanted to know what was up. In
rapid order. Peninsula news
papers. the director of Stanford's
News and Publications Office, stu
dents and faculty began phoning
in.
One? professor "nearly flipped."
Another said half the faculty was
ready to pack if the report was
verified. Most of the callers ap
peared more incredulous at the
thought of Sterling's leaving, than
at Nixon's coming.
ONLY ONE or two callers
sounded enthusiastic at the idea.
The others either disagreed with
Nixon's politics or felt his aca
demic back g r o un d left him
"rather unqualified." as one stu
dent put it, to be president of a
university.
(Nixon's only degree, aside
from honorary ones, is an A.B. in
law from Duke University.)

"The trustees are enthusiastic
about the achievements of Dr.
Sterling in his 11 years as presi
dent, and anticipate even greater
accr mplishments under his leader
ship in the years ahead.
But while it was alive, the ru
mor did kick up quite a commotion
on campus. Tne Daily, which car
ried no story yesterday because
ihe paper had been put to press
Tuesday night flue to technical
reasons arising from the holiday,
received at least 50 phone calls
between 1 p.m. and 11 p.m.
Wednesday.
IT ALE began when United
Press International phoned and
wanted to know what was up. In
rapid order. Peninsula news
papers. the director of Stanford's
News and Publications Office, stu
dents and faculty began phoning
in.
One? professor "nearly flipped."
Another said half the faculty was
ready to pack if the report was
verified. Most of the callers ap
peared more incredulous at the
thought of Sterling's leaving, than
at Nixon's coming.
ONLY ONE or two callers
sounded enthusiastic at the idea.
The others either disagreed with
Nixon's politics or felt his aca
demic back g r o un d left him
"rather unqualified." as one stu
dent put it, to be president of a
university.
(Nixon's only degree, aside
from honorary ones, is an A.B. in
law from Duke University.)
"I nearly flipped!"
Thus did one professor neatly sum up reaction on campus yester
day to the Los Angeles newspaper report that former vice president
Richard M. Nixon was in line to replace Stanford President Wallace
Sterling.
The article, published under huge headline type on page one of
Wednesday's Los Angeles Herald-1

Express, said Nixon was slated
for a top executive post at Stan
ford.
REACTION and complete denial
came swiftly from all parts of
Stanford officialdom, and yester
day from Nixon himself.
In a telegram to Sterling, Nixon
declared "No one could have been
more surprised than I when I
was informed of press reports
speculating that I might be named
President of Stanford. As you of
course know, there is no founda
tion in fact whatever for these re
ports. No one has discussed with
me or with any member of my
staff even the possibility of my
taking such a position."
And Thomas P. Pike, president
of I he University's Board of Trus
tees and Nixon's California cam
paign manager during the presi
dential campaign also denied the
report.
"THE STORY is totally un
founded," he said in a statement
yesterday."The appointment of
a president is the responsibility
solely of the Trustees and I can
state without qualification that
nothing of the sort suggested by
the Herald-Express has been con
sidered.
