# Legislature Votes Probe of Stanford Health Facilities
## LASSU Hears RAs' Letter Blast Doctors 
### 
More than three hours of con
fusion and delay in medical aid
for stricken students in the En
cina food-poisoning case was
charged in a letter read to Legis
lature last night. After hearing
the charges, LASSU appointed a
committee to investigate student
health facilities.
The letter was sent to Dean of
Men William G. Craig and was
written by Crothers Memorial
Hall Resident Assistant James
M. Dort and Crothers Hall lIA
John S. Chapman. It was read to
LASSU by Ward Mac Donald,
graduate representative from the
humanities and sciences.
DORT AND Chapman leveled
their main blast at the doctor who
was on duty at the Palo Alto
Health Clinic the night when the
graduate students who ate dinner
at Enclna Dining Hall earlier that
evening began to come down with
severe stomach pains.
A« Dort and Chapman described
it, the first cases were reported
to Chapman about 8:30. He called
the clinic and described the symp
toms to the doctor on duty, who
diagnosed the trouble as stomach
flu.
At 9:30, another 20 more cases
had reported to Chapman, and
when Dort returned to Cro Mom
at 10, he was greeted by several
sick students.
Till-; DOCTOR again was called,
but continued to attribute the
sickness to the flu, the RA's said.
A little later. Chapman found 30
more ill men in Crothers and
phoned the doctor—who still re
fused to come.
But with 40 men ill in Cro Mem
about 10:20, the doctor agreed to
visit the dorms. A little later Dort
called tho clinic and was told the
doctor was at the Stanford-Palo
Alto Hospital treating food
poisoning cases, the letter said.
Dr. George H. Ilouck, director
of the Health Service, was called
and said the doctor was on his
way. The RA's say they then dis
covered the doctor was being de
layed by preparation of medicine
at the hospital, and claim Ilouck
refused to come to the dorms,
saying the doctor on duty should
come.
FINALLY, the letter stated, the
doctor arrived at 11:45, followed
by Dr. John F. Eekert, associate
director of the Health Service,
and another physician.
The RA's declared in the letter
that the doctor then distributed
medicine to the many ill students
which Eekert said would make
them sick.
They also claimed that the doc
tors refused to visit the men who
were in their rooms too ill to get
up for the medicine. Dort and
Chapman also say tho poisoning,
