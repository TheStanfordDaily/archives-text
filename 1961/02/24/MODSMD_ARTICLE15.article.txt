# Papers Good—But Must Get Better
## 
### 
This week's two-day Focus conference on "The Responsibility of
the American Press" served to pinpoint the striking contrasts appar
ent in this nation's newspapers.
On one hand, as Palmer Hoyt —editor of the respected Denver
Post—pointed out, American newspapers are the best in the world
and are improving each year as publishers, editors and reporters in
creasingly realize the importance and responsibility of daily and
weekly papers, which are without doubt the country's number one
medium of adult education, as the Focus panelists noted.
But, one cannot ignore the sizeable number of papers which con
tinue to present their readers with a constant diet of "sin, seduction
and sensationalism." Many of these papers, such as the New York
Daily News, have huge circulations —at once a comment on the re
sponsibility of the readers and the publishers.
It is said by many journalists that such papers exist because
"that's what the public wants." We question that many of those who
believe this have ever attempted to change the irresponsible journals
into respectable papers.
A prime example of journalistic irresponsibility hits Stanford
doorsteps every morning when either the San Francisco Chronicle
of The Examiner arrives. Here are two major papers engaged in an
obvious battle for circulation which is now reaching the ridiculous
stage with both claiming to have the largest circulation—according
to the figures of each.
Both have the facilities and talent to publish top-flight newspapers
every day. But they apparently believe that Bay Area readers prefer
the current type of publication—and so readers who have no other
papers to turn to are treated to girls in nightgowns on page one, mis
leading banner headlines, important news buried in the back pages,
and so on. They point to steadily increasing circulation as justifica
tion for their products.
We submit that a growing population which has no alternative
to the San Francisco papers and therefore must buy them for the
little important news and the necessary advertising information they
contain is responsible for the circulation rise. We also believe that a
more responsible treatment of the news would not cause a rapid drop
in the circulation of either paper.
It was heartening to hear the editor of such an important paper
as the Post—an "old-line" journalist at that—also declare that he feels
one of a newspaper's first jobs is to educate its readers on world
affairs through the presentation in its pages of international news.
As Hoyt put it, the Post in this era regards international news as
"local" news.
Not so long ago, this view would have drawn fire from most edi
tors and publishers, just as Hoyt's determination to be fair toward
political candidates in news columns —even though his paper sup
ported one over the other—did in years past.
But Hoyt also was less than enthusiastic over the idea of a group
of journalists examining the performance of the press after political
campaigns for objectivity, news treatment and so forth.
While saying he favored the idea, he felt editors and publishers
would not be influenced or even take note of the study and what
ever conclusions or recommendations it came up with, thus it
wouldn't accomplish anything.
We disagree, since it seems to us that if the public were informed
of biased reporting, inadequate coverage or other forms of unfairness
in political campaigns, it would soon make its views known. Cer
tainly the politicians could be expected to note with interest any
prejudice on the part of the press.
If such a study showed relatively little prejudice, on the other
hand, it would serve a useful purpose in bolstering the confidence
of all concerned in the fairness of newspapers.
So, while we are in accord with Hoyt's belief in the overall qual
ity of the American press in comparison with other nations, we see
great room for improvement. The newspapers which are not serving
their readers and their profession responsibly, which are not attempt
ing to educate the public on important matters, which emphasize the
trivial but sensational over the vital isues, must change their ways.
If they do this, and if the good papers continue to improve, Amer
ica's press could very soon reach the level of consistent quality which
it is capable of reaching—and which its readers deserve.

papers to turn to are treated to girls in nightgowns on page one, mis
leading banner headlines, important news buried in the back pages,
and so on. They point to steadily increasing circulation as justifica
tion for their products.
We submit that a growing population which has no alternative
to the San Francisco papers and therefore must buy them for the
little important news and the necessary advertising information they
contain is responsible for the circulation rise. We also believe that a
more responsible treatment of the news would not cause a rapid drop
in the circulation of either paper.
It was heartening to hear the editor of such an important paper
as the Post—an "old-line" journalist at that—also declare that he feels
one of a newspaper's first jobs is to educate its readers on world
affairs through the presentation in its pages of international news.
As Hoyt put it, the Post in this era regards international news as
"local" news.
Not so long ago, this view would have drawn fire from most edi
tors and publishers, just as Hoyt's determination to be fair toward
political candidates in news columns —even though his paper sup
ported one over the other—did in years past.
But Hoyt also was less than enthusiastic over the idea of a group
of journalists examining the performance of the press after political
campaigns for objectivity, news treatment and so forth.
While saying he favored the idea, he felt editors and publishers
would not be influenced or even take note of the study and what
ever conclusions or recommendations it came up with, thus it
wouldn't accomplish anything.
We disagree, since it seems to us that if the public were informed
of biased reporting, inadequate coverage or other forms of unfairness
in political campaigns, it would soon make its views known. Cer
tainly the politicians could be expected to note with interest any
prejudice on the part of the press.
If such a study showed relatively little prejudice, on the other
hand, it would serve a useful purpose in bolstering the confidence
of all concerned in the fairness of newspapers.
So, while we are in accord with Hoyt's belief in the overall qual
ity of the American press in comparison with other nations, we see
great room for improvement. The newspapers which are not serving
their readers and their profession responsibly, which are not attempt
ing to educate the public on important matters, which emphasize the
trivial but sensational over the vital isues, must change their ways.
If they do this, and if the good papers continue to improve, Amer
ica's press could very soon reach the level of consistent quality which
it is capable of reaching—and which its readers deserve.
This week's two-day Focus conference on "The Responsibility of
the American Press" served to pinpoint the striking contrasts appar
ent in this nation's newspapers.
On one hand, as Palmer Hoyt —editor of the respected Denver
Post—pointed out, American newspapers are the best in the world
and are improving each year as publishers, editors and reporters in
creasingly realize the importance and responsibility of daily and
weekly papers, which are without doubt the country's number one
medium of adult education, as the Focus panelists noted.
But, one cannot ignore the sizeable number of papers which con
tinue to present their readers with a constant diet of "sin, seduction
and sensationalism." Many of these papers, such as the New York
Daily News, have huge circulations —at once a comment on the re
sponsibility of the readers and the publishers.
It is said by many journalists that such papers exist because
"that's what the public wants." We question that many of those who
believe this have ever attempted to change the irresponsible journals
into respectable papers.
A prime example of journalistic irresponsibility hits Stanford
doorsteps every morning when either the San Francisco Chronicle
of The Examiner arrives. Here are two major papers engaged in an
obvious battle for circulation which is now reaching the ridiculous
stage with both claiming to have the largest circulation—according
to the figures of each.
Both have the facilities and talent to publish top-flight newspapers
every day. But they apparently believe that Bay Area readers prefer
the current type of publication—and so readers who have no other
papers to turn to are treated to girls in nightgowns on page one, mis
leading banner headlines, important news buried in the back pages,
and so on. They point to steadily increasing circulation as justifica
