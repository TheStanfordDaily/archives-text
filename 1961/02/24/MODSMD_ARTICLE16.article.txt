The New York Times
In a statement we have quoted previously, John F. Kennedy as
candidate for the Presidency said on Oct. 17, 1960: "All appoint
ments, both high and low, will be made on the basis of ability. . . ."
John F. Kennedy as President has adhered, with a few exceptions, to
the high standard he thus set for himself.
But now that the ambassadorial posts are being filled, it is worth
reminding the President of his campaign promises to name only the
best-qualified men to represent this country abroad. The President
has done just this in the case of David K. E. Bruce, now being sent
to London after long and successful diplomatic experience in both
Paris and Bonn.
As for Paris, Lieut. Gen. James M. Gavin is a distinguished retired
Army officer, but we are not sure what in his background of training
particularly singles him out for the French post, one of the most deli
cate and important in the diplomatic service. However, he is a man
of character and conviction. He is also without large private means,
and he deserves the support of Congress—specifically of the House
Appropriations subcommittee headed by Representative John J. Roo
ney of Brooklyn—to make it possible for a man in his position to
serve as Ambassador without having to dig into his own pocket.
The appointment as Ambassador to Ireland of Grant Stockdale,
a Miami real estate dealer and former administrative assistant to
President Kennedy's friend, Senator George Smathers of Florida, is
also a puzzler by these standards.
It would be most unfortunate if the new Administration slipped
back into the custom of handing out a good many of the desirable
European posts to strictly political appointees. There has been a glow
about almost all of the Kennedy appointments up to now. We would
hate to see that glow wear off so soon.
