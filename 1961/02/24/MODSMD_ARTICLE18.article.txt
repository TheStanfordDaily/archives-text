## Congo Violence 
### 
In spite of the violent course of
events in the Congo during the
past months, it is wrong to con
stantly put those events into East-
West Communist-Democratic op
position, projecting our national
fear through such absolute judg
ments. Certainly the threats exist,
but it is incorrect to unequivoc
ably label Lumumba Communist
because of the support given him
by the USSR. We may not con
sider the African leaders political
ly mature in our own context, but
they are definitely not "little boys
playing with political fire." We
cannot transplant Western De
mocracy to the African continent.
Though we think some of Lu
mumba's actions to have been
wrong, this docs not authorize an
all-out condemnation of the man
chosen by the majority of the
Congolese as their leader. Wc
must respect their right 1o make
mistakes in-their attempt to reach
an African solution to African
problems.
