# Show Falls Short
## 
### 
The International Show staged
yesterday in the Dinkelspiel Audi
torium was entertaining but fell
short of our expectations because
of the one-nation, all-male or one
man monopoly of the show. W<>
expected an educational variety
from as many nation* as are rep
resented at Stanford University
but we were given a big dose of
one-man entertainment. The
printed program designed to in
form was a confusion because of
the one-man acts and all-male
monopoly of time. In my country
we call thofje fellows "crocodiles."
I hope that the sponsors of the
program will not tolerate this
show of egotism in the future.
There wore excellent numbers
which would have been sufficient
to convey the international color
of the show. The numbers from
Finland, Scotland, India, and Ha
waii were wonderful—'kudos' to
to those who rendered these num
bers.
Will you print this letter in your
next issue? Thank you!
