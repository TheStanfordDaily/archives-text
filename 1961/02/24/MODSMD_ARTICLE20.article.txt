# Johnson and ATO's
## 
### 
I am writing this let tor in refer
ence to an article in Monday's
Daily by Keem Stassen, in which
Gerald Johnson, national ATO
president demonstrated his innate
ability to distort Ihe facts and to
use faulty logic.
For the benefit of your readers,
one of Gerald Johnson's favorite
arguments against our chapter's
position is that it will "soon he
composed entirely of non-Chris
tians." For the past 15 years,
members of the Jewish faith have
been initiated by this chapter and
we now have three Jewish actives.
Mr. Johnson's statement, as
quoted in the Minnesota Daily, is,
I am afraid, typical of his attempt
to shroud the facts.
MIKE KAVANAUGH
President
