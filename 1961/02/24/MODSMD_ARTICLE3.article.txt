week of rehearsals and technical
changes "in light of audience re
action." will play again in the Lit
tle Theater this weekend. Cur
tain lime for tonight's rind Satur
day night's performances is 8:30.
The three plays, written by stu

Head, include two dramas and a
comedy. They range in setting
from ancient Rome, through the
Ozarks during I lie Civil War, to
modern N'ow York City.
"White Mountain Laurel," by
Jim Lyon, deals with reactions
of the Ozark mountain folk to an
intruder from the valley. Lyon
also designed the unusual multi

ple set for the play.
Pauline Peotter's "The Leash"
has New York as a background
for its electric mood. Its three
characters, played by Fred Wat
kins, Barbara Stevens, and Dave
Kirk, reveal complex problems.
"When in Rome," by Dave Kirk,
sets an entirely different mood.
It is a "comedy of manners," and
juxtaposes modern slang in a
classical background for a highly
entertaining result.

dent Union, at the Memorial Audi
torium Box Office, or by calling :
