j an 18-5 score.
The Trojans, only in their see
i oncl season of a revived rugby
I program, lost to California's
| Bears in their last outing, 9-3, but
according to Ihe USC coach could
just have easily pulled out a 6-6
tie.
CAL USUALLY comes up with
the top coast rugby team, and a
9-3 loss to the Bears is no dis
grace. El Troje should provide

I with all the action they can han
! die.
Best of Ihe USC rugby-men are
footballers Jerry Traynham, Al
Prukop, George Van Vliet, Carl
, Skvarna and Ben Rosen. Ex-hoop

with a Bay Area squad, the Bru
ins gained a 6-6 draw with Ihe
j Olympic Club.
UNLIKE USC, the Uclans' out

I foreign players.
! Peter Nicklin, a fullback from
South Africa, is the best of the
Bruin ruggers. Nicklin is a stick
