"A few years back McCarthy
ism exploited the Communist
menace in an effort to eliminate
the fifth amendment; today law
officials are exploiting the nar
cotics menace in Califrnia in an
effort to eliminate the fourth
amendment."
Such was the analysis made by
prominent Los Angeles attorney
and Democratic official Paul
Ziffren last night in a campus
address relating narcotics and
civil liberties, sponsored by the
Stanford Area Young Democrats.
THE FOURTH amendment, pro
tection against unreasonable
search and seizure, came into its
own in California in 1955 in the
Stale Supreme Court's "Cahan
Decision." It was this decision
Ziffren used as the kick-off for
his attack on the encroachments
upon civil liberties by police in
their effort to find short cuts.
Cahan was a convicted Los
Angeles bookie who was freed by
the State Supreme Court grounds
that the evidence against him was

obtained illegally police had
broken into his home without a
search warrant. California was
merely applying here the same re
strictions which govern the FBI.
And Yet California is attempting
to repeal the Cahan precedent, Zif
fren said, an act which he felt
was tho mere reflection of law en
forcement officials seeking to
make their task simpler by elimi
nation of constitutional restric
tions placed upon them.
"The current narcotics hysteria
in California is being exploited to
the extent that we are actually
aggravating the problem instead
of solving it. We are diverted from
trying to understand the narcotics
user to trying to eliminate re
strictions."
ZIFFREN called upon histori
cal precedent to justify his appeal
for broader and better enforced
search-warrant policies, an appeal
which is currently in front of the
California legislature in reference
to its connection with dope.
Two hundred years ago today,
James Otis' plea in the English
courts of Boston against the writs
of assistance which enabled reck
less search was turned down. Zif
fren, in quoting John Adams,
dated American independence and
the justification for his case
