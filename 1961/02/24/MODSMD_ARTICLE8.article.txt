# Strike Ends; JFK Names SU Lawyer
## 
### 
President John F. Kennedy
brought an end to the six-day-old
strike of airline flight engineers
late yesterday. Ho ended the
strike by getting five of the air
lines to promise no reprisals and
by appointing a commission, in
cluding Prof. J. Keith Mann of
the Stanford Law School, to in
vestigate the dispute between the
engineers and the carriers.
The engineers were protesting a
National Mediation Board order,
still in effect, which orders pilots
and engineers at United Air Lines
to vote on whether both should be
represented by tho pilot's union.
The engineers said they eventu
ally would lose their jobs if forced
into the pilots' union.
THE SI»EC I AL presidential
commission was given 90 days
within which to investigate the
airline dispute, recommend set
tlement terms, and try to mediate
differences between the parties.
Mann left for Washington Tues
day to join the two other mem
bers of the commission — Prof.
Nathan Feinsinger of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, chairman; and
Prof. Richard Lester of Princeton.
Mann. 36, had difficulty obtaining
a plane reservation but finally
made arrangements with United
Air Lines, which was not involved
in the stoppage.
Before his arrival at Stanford in
1952, Mann served as chairman of
the review and appeals committee
of the Wage Stabilization Board
during the Korean War. Begin
ning at Stanford as an assistant
professor, he has become a full
professor and is currently teach
ing a course on ''Problems in Col
lective Bargaining."
PROF. LAWRENCE Ebb, a col
league of Mann's at the Stanford
Law School, speculated that this
commission of professors may bo
illustrative of a trend that will call
upon universities such as Stan
ford to participate directly in gov
ernment. He commented that "rel
ative to Harvard. Yale, and Co
lumbia, few Stanford professors
have worked for the government
because of Hie great traveling dis
tances. That the President at
tended our Business School means
he is, at least, aware of Stanford's
potential assistance."
SOME 3,500 members of the In
ternational Flight Engineers Asso
ciation (AFL-CIOi were involved
in the strike, the most costly ever
to hit U.S. airlines.
A total of 80,000 men and
women were idled by the walkout.
All the airlines except Western
were rapidly resuming service
late last night. Personnel had
been recalled and a few first
flights were back in the air.
Full service was expected by
late today or early tomorrow. San
Francisco International Airport
was a scene of great activity as
the airlines worked feverishly to
restore service.

to hit U.S. airlines.
A total of 80,000 men and
women were idled by the walkout.
All the airlines except Western
were rapidly resuming service
late last night. Personnel had
been recalled and a few first
flights were back in the air.
Full service was expected by
late today or early tomorrow. San
Francisco International Airport
was a scene of great activity as
the airlines worked feverishly to
restore service.
President John F. Kennedy
brought an end to the six-day-old
strike of airline flight engineers
late yesterday. Ho ended the
strike by getting five of the air
lines to promise no reprisals and
by appointing a commission, in
cluding Prof. J. Keith Mann of
the Stanford Law School, to in
vestigate the dispute between the
engineers and the carriers.
The engineers were protesting a
National Mediation Board order,
still in effect, which orders pilots
and engineers at United Air Lines
to vote on whether both should be
represented by tho pilot's union.
The engineers said they eventu
ally would lose their jobs if forced
into the pilots' union.
THE SI»EC I AL presidential
commission was given 90 days
within which to investigate the
airline dispute, recommend set
tlement terms, and try to mediate
differences between the parties.
Mann left for Washington Tues
day to join the two other mem
bers of the commission — Prof.
Nathan Feinsinger of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin, chairman; and
Prof. Richard Lester of Princeton.
Mann. 36, had difficulty obtaining
a plane reservation but finally
made arrangements with United
Air Lines, which was not involved
in the stoppage.
Before his arrival at Stanford in
1952, Mann served as chairman of
the review and appeals committee
of the Wage Stabilization Board
during the Korean War. Begin
ning at Stanford as an assistant
professor, he has become a full
professor and is currently teach
ing a course on ''Problems in Col
lective Bargaining."
PROF. LAWRENCE Ebb, a col
league of Mann's at the Stanford
Law School, speculated that this
commission of professors may bo
illustrative of a trend that will call
upon universities such as Stan
ford to participate directly in gov
ernment. He commented that "rel
ative to Harvard. Yale, and Co
lumbia, few Stanford professors
have worked for the government
because of Hie great traveling dis
tances. That the President at
tended our Business School means
he is, at least, aware of Stanford's
potential assistance."
SOME 3,500 members of the In
ternational Flight Engineers Asso
ciation (AFL-CIOi were involved
in the strike, the most costly ever
to hit U.S. airlines.
