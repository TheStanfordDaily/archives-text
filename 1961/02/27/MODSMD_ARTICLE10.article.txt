# FRESHMAN SUFFERS BROKEN BACK IN THREE-STORY FALL
## 
### 
A springtime prarik cost 18-year-old Ben Haraguchi a broken back yesterday. The fresh
man, from San Mateo, fell 20 feet to a concrete patio while trying to escape via a bedsheet
from his third story Trancos room. He was taken by ambulance to the Stanford-Palo Alto
Hospital where doctors said he had suffered a fractured back and minor bruises. The acci
dent occurred when Haraguchi and his roommate were locked in their room by friends.
When the friends refused to open the door, the roommates decided they could get out
through the window. They took a bed sheet and Haraguchi climbed out the window, us
ing the sheet as a rope, leaving his roommate to hold the other end. The sheet slipped
when Haraguchi was about halfway down, and Haraguchi fell to the patio.
