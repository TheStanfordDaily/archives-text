# AWS Should Debate Merits of Chastity
## 
### 
It seems thai the Associated Women Students of the University
of British Columbia have hung out the green light for the repeal of
chastity. Two woman students debating on the subject "Resolved
that Chastity is outmoded" won the argument as they guoted pas
sages from the Kinsey Report as well as less reputable sources.
One Miss Brown argued that "Chastity is like being clad in a steel
suit, and who wants to be clad completely in steel? ' She continued
that "the whole structure of fraternity parties would collapse," if
chastity were observed.
The judges were unswayed as the all-male defense countered
that "conceiving children in taxicabs is vulgar. Conception in Volks
wagens is more vulgar." The women had the day—but would not
uphold their beliefs as an audience guestioner asked them "as is a
custom in a challenge, to name the time and place."
All this frivolity was attended by more than 1,000 students
which proves the existence of a lot of actively curious minds and x or
that the guestion is one of vital interest in the troubled minds of to
day's college women. If we hold with the latter, it would be well for
a great university like Stanford to do a little public thinking on
chastity. Our own Associated Women's President has long won
dered how to raise funds. What better way than to charge admis
sion to a debate on chastity in Memorial Auditorium. Only let us
hope that Stanford women will not stoop to guoting double-mean
ing phrases for the male undergraduate audience to lap up. Rather
we would expect a serious debate on a guestion. which should be a
serious concern to all female and many male members of the stu
dent body.
With average luck the AWS might be able to draw more than
the 150 people who turned out for last Monday night's talk on the
"Responsibility of the American Press."
Meanwhile, until the AWS decides whether we should over
throw Western morality, we urge temperance. After all, the Health
Service is overcrowded.
