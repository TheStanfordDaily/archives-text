## Federal Aid Program Not to Control Schools 
### 
Despite Sen. Goldwater, who
has just declared that Federal aid
to education is "unconstitutional,"
the practice of federal aid is in
fact older than the constitution.
As early as the Land Ordinance of
1785, the Confederation provided
that the lGth section of each town
ship or one-thirty-sixth of the
acreage in the public land states
should be granted to the states by
the national government for the
benefit of the common schools.
Ever since the federal union

w a s established
it has been giv
ing aid to educa
tion in a large
variety of ways,
and it is sheer
deception to de
clare that what
has always been
done is "uncon
stitutional."
\V II I L E fed
eral aid has been

given since the founding of the
nation, what has never been done
is 1o set up federal control of edu
cation. It is indeed quite contrary
to American principles and prac
tices for the federal government
to control what is taught in ihe
public schools, how it is taught,
who teaches it. The control of ed
ucation is reserved to the states,
and no one engaged in the present
discussion is proposing to tamper
with that principle. The Kennedy
program is unequivocal and scru
pulous in reserving to the states
the control of education.
Thus in the proposed contri
bution to public elementary and
secondary schools, the Kennedy
program leaves it to each state to
decide whether the federal contri
bution shall be used to build
schools or to raise teacher sal
aries. The loan program for col
lege housing and for academic fa
cilities is operated by local initi
ative. The four-year program for
scholarships is to be "state-ad
ministered."
WHY. THEN, with such careful
respect for states' rights, is it
necessary to bring in Ihe federal
government at all? The answer is
that the number of children and
youths who have to be educated
has outgrown the resources which
can be raised in a very large num
ber of the states. The American
nation can quite well afford to
educate all its young at least at
the level of the most advanced
states, for example, California. It
is nonsense to argue that the
United States is too poor to edu
cate its children. But it is not ed
ucating them properly, and almost
certainly it cannot and will not

do so if the whole task of raising
the necessary funds is left to the
50 state legislatures and the local
school districts.
Here is the essence of the Ken
nedy program. It has nothing to
rlo with the control of education.
It does not propose to have the
federal government pay all the
costs, supplement the states and
localities. It does propose to sup
plement state and local funds with
a comparatively small contribu
tion.
One reason for the slower
growth of Ihe state, and local
revenues is the necessary reliance
of those governments, especially
the localities, upon the property
tax. The smaller geographic
units of government are forced to
rely upon immobile tax bases
which cannot move to other juris
dictions to escape taxation. Al
though the fiscal capacity of the
states is not quite so limited as
that of the localities, the political
organization of many states does
not permit adequate use of state
financial resources to supplement
the resources of the localities.
Urban areas are under-repre
sented in the governments of most
states. The rural-dominated legis
latures will not enact the state
wide taxes necessary to support
the higher educational costs and
aspirations of the urban areas.
It is entirely unrealistic politi
cally. Ruml insisted, to expect to
achieve a major break-through in
American public education by op
erating one at a time upon the
45,000 school districts, or even
upon the 50 state legislatures.
IN AIJ, this wo must not fall
into the mistake of thinking that
this is a proposal to tax the rich,
and supposedly more public spir
ited, states, for the benefit of the
poorer and less energetic states.
The truth is that the poorer states
are on the whole making a greater
effort to support their schools
than are the richer states.
Thus there are 31 states with an
income per school child which is
below the national average. Yet
they are spending 3.6 per cent of
their personal income on schools
whereas tiie 18 richer states spend
only 2.75 per cent. The richer
states can afford better schools
with less personal sacrifices.
In advocating a larger use of
the federal power to raise money
for education, the Administration
is dealing not with some fancy
theory hut with the hard practical
fiscal problems of the spates and
ihe localities. Those who oppose
the program in principle have al
most certainly not understood the
problem.

50 state legislatures and the local
school districts.
Here is the essence of the Ken
nedy program. It has nothing to
rlo with the control of education.
It does not propose to have the
federal government pay all the
costs, supplement the states and
localities. It does propose to sup
plement state and local funds with
a comparatively small contribu
tion.
One reason for the slower
growth of Ihe state, and local
revenues is the necessary reliance
of those governments, especially
the localities, upon the property
tax. The smaller geographic
units of government are forced to
rely upon immobile tax bases
which cannot move to other juris
dictions to escape taxation. Al
though the fiscal capacity of the
states is not quite so limited as
that of the localities, the political
organization of many states does
not permit adequate use of state
financial resources to supplement
the resources of the localities.
Urban areas are under-repre
sented in the governments of most
states. The rural-dominated legis
latures will not enact the state
wide taxes necessary to support
the higher educational costs and
aspirations of the urban areas.
It is entirely unrealistic politi
cally. Ruml insisted, to expect to
achieve a major break-through in
American public education by op
erating one at a time upon the
45,000 school districts, or even
upon the 50 state legislatures.
IN AIJ, this wo must not fall
into the mistake of thinking that
this is a proposal to tax the rich,
and supposedly more public spir
ited, states, for the benefit of the
poorer and less energetic states.
The truth is that the poorer states
are on the whole making a greater
effort to support their schools
than are the richer states.
Thus there are 31 states with an
income per school child which is
below the national average. Yet
they are spending 3.6 per cent of
their personal income on schools
whereas tiie 18 richer states spend
only 2.75 per cent. The richer
states can afford better schools
with less personal sacrifices.
In advocating a larger use of
the federal power to raise money
for education, the Administration
is dealing not with some fancy
theory hut with the hard practical
fiscal problems of the spates and
ihe localities. Those who oppose
the program in principle have al
most certainly not understood the
problem.

Despite Sen. Goldwater, who
has just declared that Federal aid
to education is "unconstitutional,"
the practice of federal aid is in
fact older than the constitution.
As early as the Land Ordinance of
1785, the Confederation provided
that the lGth section of each town
ship or one-thirty-sixth of the
acreage in the public land states
should be granted to the states by
the national government for the
benefit of the common schools.
Ever since the federal union

w a s established
it has been giv
ing aid to educa
tion in a large
variety of ways,
and it is sheer
deception to de
clare that what
has always been
done is "uncon
stitutional."
\V II I L E fed
eral aid has been

given since the founding of the
nation, what has never been done
is 1o set up federal control of edu
cation. It is indeed quite contrary
to American principles and prac
tices for the federal government
to control what is taught in ihe
public schools, how it is taught,
who teaches it. The control of ed
ucation is reserved to the states,
and no one engaged in the present
discussion is proposing to tamper
with that principle. The Kennedy
program is unequivocal and scru
pulous in reserving to the states
the control of education.
Thus in the proposed contri
bution to public elementary and
secondary schools, the Kennedy
program leaves it to each state to
decide whether the federal contri
bution shall be used to build
schools or to raise teacher sal
aries. The loan program for col
lege housing and for academic fa
cilities is operated by local initi
ative. The four-year program for
scholarships is to be "state-ad
ministered."
WHY. THEN, with such careful
respect for states' rights, is it
necessary to bring in Ihe federal
government at all? The answer is
that the number of children and
youths who have to be educated
has outgrown the resources which
can be raised in a very large num
ber of the states. The American
nation can quite well afford to
educate all its young at least at
the level of the most advanced
states, for example, California. It
is nonsense to argue that the
United States is too poor to edu
cate its children. But it is not ed
ucating them properly, and almost
certainly it cannot and will not

do so if the whole task of raising

has just declared that Federal aid
to education is "unconstitutional,"
the practice of federal aid is in
fact older than the constitution.
As early as the Land Ordinance of
1785, the Confederation provided
that the lGth section of each town
ship or one-thirty-sixth of the
acreage in the public land states
should be granted to the states by
the national government for the
benefit of the common schools.
Ever since the federal union

w a s established
it has been giv
ing aid to educa
tion in a large
variety of ways,
and it is sheer
deception to de
clare that what
has always been
done is "uncon
stitutional."
\V II I L E fed
eral aid has been

given since the founding of the
nation, what has never been done
is 1o set up federal control of edu
cation. It is indeed quite contrary
to American principles and prac
tices for the federal government
to control what is taught in ihe
public schools, how it is taught,
who teaches it. The control of ed
ucation is reserved to the states,
and no one engaged in the present
discussion is proposing to tamper
with that principle. The Kennedy
program is unequivocal and scru
pulous in reserving to the states
the control of education.
Thus in the proposed contri
bution to public elementary and
secondary schools, the Kennedy
program leaves it to each state to
decide whether the federal contri
bution shall be used to build
schools or to raise teacher sal
aries. The loan program for col
lege housing and for academic fa
cilities is operated by local initi
ative. The four-year program for
scholarships is to be "state-ad
ministered."
WHY. THEN, with such careful
respect for states' rights, is it
necessary to bring in Ihe federal
government at all? The answer is
that the number of children and
youths who have to be educated
has outgrown the resources which
can be raised in a very large num
ber of the states. The American
nation can quite well afford to
educate all its young at least at
the level of the most advanced
states, for example, California. It
is nonsense to argue that the
United States is too poor to edu
cate its children. But it is not ed
ucating them properly, and almost
certainly it cannot and will not

do so if the whole task of raising
the necessary funds is left to the
50 state legislatures and the local
school districts.
Here is the essence of the Ken
nedy program. It has nothing to
rlo with the control of education.
It does not propose to have the
federal government pay all the
costs, supplement the states and
localities. It does propose to sup
plement state and local funds with
a comparatively small contribu
tion.
One reason for the slower
growth of Ihe state, and local
revenues is the necessary reliance
of those governments, especially
the localities, upon the property
tax. The smaller geographic
units of government are forced to
rely upon immobile tax bases
which cannot move to other juris
dictions to escape taxation. Al
though the fiscal capacity of the
states is not quite so limited as
that of the localities, the political
organization of many states does
not permit adequate use of state
financial resources to supplement
the resources of the localities.
Urban areas are under-repre
sented in the governments of most
states. The rural-dominated legis
latures will not enact the state
wide taxes necessary to support
the higher educational costs and
aspirations of the urban areas.
It is entirely unrealistic politi
cally. Ruml insisted, to expect to
achieve a major break-through in
American public education by op
erating one at a time upon the
45,000 school districts, or even
upon the 50 state legislatures.
IN AIJ, this wo must not fall
into the mistake of thinking that
this is a proposal to tax the rich,
and supposedly more public spir
ited, states, for the benefit of the
poorer and less energetic states.
The truth is that the poorer states
are on the whole making a greater
effort to support their schools
than are the richer states.
Thus there are 31 states with an
income per school child which is
below the national average. Yet
they are spending 3.6 per cent of
their personal income on schools
whereas tiie 18 richer states spend
only 2.75 per cent. The richer
states can afford better schools
with less personal sacrifices.
In advocating a larger use of
the federal power to raise money
for education, the Administration
is dealing not with some fancy
theory hut with the hard practical
fiscal problems of the spates and
ihe localities. Those who oppose
the program in principle have al
most certainly not understood the
problem.
