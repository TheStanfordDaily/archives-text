## JFK Takes Vital Step To Improve Education 
### 
President Kennedy last week
took a vital step toward improv
ing the quality of this country's
public education when ho sent
Congress a $5.6 billion "program
of grants and loans to build public
schools, boost teachers' pay and
increase college opportunities."
In his message to Congress,
Kennedy said "This is a modest
program with ambitious g0a15....

For some 40
years, the Con
gress has wres
tled with this
prob 1 e m and
searched for a
workable so 1 u
tion. I believe
that we now have
such a solution;
and that this Con
gress in this year
will make a land-

mark contribution to American
education."
THE PROGRAM includes a
series of sweeping proposals
which would give states money
for school c on struct i on and
teacher salaries. It also would es
tablish a five-year plan of state
administered scholarships for up
to 212,500 "talented and needy"
college students; would extend
the college housing loan program
for five years in loans to help
build college classrooms and other
academic facilities.
Naturally, the President's pro
gram has drawn fire from South
ern Democrats and Republicans.
"Federally controlled education!"
they cry, along with other as
sorted wails and gnashing of
teeth. They are led, of course, by
that Neanderthal figure from
Arizona, Barry Goldwater.
HOPEFULLY, Congress will ig
nore Goldwater and the other con
servatives for once and pass the
legislation. Perhaps if they had
not listened in past years, the
state of U.S. education would not
be what it is now, and such a pro
gram would be unnecessary.
Kennedy's program is in direct
opposition to that which President
Eisenhower submitted in his
budget for fiscal year 1962. Ike
asked for only $610 million for
"promotion of education." He said
the "primary responsibility for ed
ucation rests with the local com
munities and states," with the
federal government "limited to
providing assistance where there
is a special national concern."
We would agree with Ike that
such things as curriculum.amount
of salary for teachers, where
school buildings are built, etc.. are
no one's concern but the states
and communities. But, we feel
that the quality of a U.S. public
school education is bad enough
that federal assistance in the
form of grants for construction,
scholarships and pay to teachers
—is necessary il the needed re
vamp of public education is to
take place.
WE THINK the time is past
when local communities and
states can carry the burden of

education by themselves. Federal
air! is going to be necessary from
now on unless citizens wish to
burden themselves with increas
ingly heavy tax rates. Judging by
the many rejections of local school
tax issues, ii appears they don't
want that.
One thing which impresses us
is Kennedy's plan for college
scholarships. The average grant
would be $700, the maximum $1,-

000. and colleges and universities
would gel an additional $350
yearly for each federal scholar
ship student admitted.
\Ve hope Congress will show it
agrees with Kennedy's statement
that the nation's twin goals must
be "a new standard of excellence
in education and 1 he availability
of such excellence to all who are
willing and able to pursue it."
AS THK President puts it, "One
sided aid is not enough. . . . We
must give attention to both teach
ers' salaries and classrooms, both
college academic facilities and
dormitories, both scholarships and
loans, both vocational and gen
eral education.
"This investment will pay rich
dividends in the years ahead in
increased economic growth, in en

lightened citizens, in national ex
cellence. . .
Maybe this time Congress will
realize that the nation has had
enough of generally second-rate
education in its public schools and
lhat much federal school aid is
necessary and will not lead to
federal control as a natural result,
as long as Congress and the peo
ple keep their eyes open.

President Kennedy last week
took a vital step toward improv
ing the quality of this country's
public education when ho sent
Congress a $5.6 billion "program
of grants and loans to build public
schools, boost teachers' pay and
increase college opportunities."
In his message to Congress,
Kennedy said "This is a modest
program with ambitious g0a15....

For some 40
years, the Con
gress has wres
tled with this
prob 1 e m and
searched for a
workable so 1 u
tion. I believe
that we now have
such a solution;
and that this Con
gress in this year
will make a land-

mark contribution to American
education."
THE PROGRAM includes a
series of sweeping proposals
which would give states money
for school c on struct i on and
teacher salaries. It also would es
tablish a five-year plan of state
administered scholarships for up
to 212,500 "talented and needy"
college students; would extend
the college housing loan program
for five years in loans to help
build college classrooms and other
academic facilities.
Naturally, the President's pro
gram has drawn fire from South
ern Democrats and Republicans.
"Federally controlled education!"
they cry, along with other as
sorted wails and gnashing of
teeth. They are led, of course, by
that Neanderthal figure from
Arizona, Barry Goldwater.
HOPEFULLY, Congress will ig
nore Goldwater and the other con
servatives for once and pass the
legislation. Perhaps if they had
not listened in past years, the
state of U.S. education would not
be what it is now, and such a pro
gram would be unnecessary.
Kennedy's program is in direct
opposition to that which President
Eisenhower submitted in his
budget for fiscal year 1962. Ike
asked for only $610 million for
"promotion of education." He said
the "primary responsibility for ed
ucation rests with the local com
munities and states," with the
federal government "limited to
providing assistance where there
is a special national concern."
We would agree with Ike that
such things as curriculum.amount
of salary for teachers, where
school buildings are built, etc.. are
no one's concern but the states
and communities. But, we feel

administered scholarships for up
to 212,500 "talented and needy"
college students; would extend
the college housing loan program
for five years in loans to help
build college classrooms and other
academic facilities.
Naturally, the President's pro
gram has drawn fire from South
ern Democrats and Republicans.
"Federally controlled education!"
they cry, along with other as
sorted wails and gnashing of
teeth. They are led, of course, by
that Neanderthal figure from
Arizona, Barry Goldwater.
HOPEFULLY, Congress will ig
nore Goldwater and the other con
servatives for once and pass the
legislation. Perhaps if they had
not listened in past years, the
state of U.S. education would not
be what it is now, and such a pro
gram would be unnecessary.
Kennedy's program is in direct
opposition to that which President
Eisenhower submitted in his
budget for fiscal year 1962. Ike
asked for only $610 million for
"promotion of education." He said
the "primary responsibility for ed
ucation rests with the local com
munities and states," with the
federal government "limited to
providing assistance where there
is a special national concern."
We would agree with Ike that
such things as curriculum.amount
of salary for teachers, where
school buildings are built, etc.. are
no one's concern but the states
and communities. But, we feel
that the quality of a U.S. public
school education is bad enough
that federal assistance in the
form of grants for construction,
scholarships and pay to teachers
—is necessary il the needed re
vamp of public education is to
take place.
WE THINK the time is past
when local communities and
states can carry the burden of

education by themselves. Federal
air! is going to be necessary from
now on unless citizens wish to
burden themselves with increas
ingly heavy tax rates. Judging by
the many rejections of local school
tax issues, ii appears they don't
want that.
One thing which impresses us
is Kennedy's plan for college
scholarships. The average grant
would be $700, the maximum $1,-

000. and colleges and universities
would gel an additional $350
yearly for each federal scholar
ship student admitted.
\Ve hope Congress will show it
agrees with Kennedy's statement
that the nation's twin goals must
be "a new standard of excellence
in education and 1 he availability
of such excellence to all who are
willing and able to pursue it."
AS THK President puts it, "One
sided aid is not enough. . . . We
must give attention to both teach
ers' salaries and classrooms, both
college academic facilities and
dormitories, both scholarships and
loans, both vocational and gen
eral education.
"This investment will pay rich
dividends in the years ahead in
increased economic growth, in en

lightened citizens, in national ex
cellence. . .
Maybe this time Congress will
realize that the nation has had
enough of generally second-rate
education in its public schools and
lhat much federal school aid is
necessary and will not lead to
federal control as a natural result,
as long as Congress and the peo
ple keep their eyes open.
