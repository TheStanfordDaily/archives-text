## 
### RON RAPOPORT 
Playing the perfect host Stanford's basketball team rolled over
and played dead twice for UCLA in the-Pavilion Saturday, and the
Bruins, who seemed too embarrassed to take advantage of the op
portunity at first, got the message midway through the second half
and went on to win 70-56. I .

In avenging its 79-65 loss to the
Indians on Feb. 11 in the Pavilion,
UCLA raised its Big Five record
to 4-4, while Stanford slipped into
a tie for the cellar with Califor
nia at 3-6.
JOHN BI;KBFKI< ir, the Bruin
6-8 center, led the scoring with IS
points, while forward John Wind
sor paced the Tribe with 15 count
ers.
After trading baskets with the
visitors for the first few minutes,
the Indians went into the first
act of their possum-playing antics,
and with eight minutes left in tho
half the Southlanders led 26-15.
But the Baby Blue could muster
only one more first-half basket,
and the Indians suddenly caught
fire and stormed back to a 2S-2X
halftime lie. The Tribe scored
seven points in a row to end the
half, including a game-tieing 15-
foot set shot by reserve forward
Darrell Sutherland with five sec
onds left.
STANFORD stayed in the game
and even led for a few precarious
moments until midway in the sec
ond half when the Bruins, led by
Berberich's hot hand, scored 11
points in a row to end the Tribe's
chances.
With UCLA ahead 43-42 and
just under 10 minutes remaining,
the big center tipped in a rebound
and made a free throw. Then in
rapid succession forward Gary
Cunningham connected, Berberich
hit again, forward Ron Lawson
scored and guard Johnny Green
sank a pair of foul shots. The
Bruins led 54-12, and this time
there was no coming back for the
Indians.
Berberich fin a 11 y got out of
Stanford's hair by fouling out
with 3:55 left, but Cunningham
and guard Bill Ellis took up the
slack and scored 12 points be
tween them in the closing minutes
to keep the Cards at a comfort
able distance.
