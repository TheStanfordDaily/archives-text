## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI) —The New York Times is undertaking a study
of the possibility of establishing a West Coast edition, its publisher,
Arthur Hays Sulzberger, has announced.
The announcement said the study will appraise the production,
circulation, advertising and distribution potentialities for the Times
in the Western states. I

THE announcement said Sulz
berger emphasized that there
would be no attempt to compete
with newspapers already oper
ating on the West Coast in the
coverage of local news and fea
tures. and that the paper would
merely supplement the local paper
if the project proves feasible.
As with the Times' international
edition in Europe, the presenta
tion would be of the news as re
ported in the New York Times in
New York on the same day, the
announcement said.
"We have for some time been
discussing plans for making the
New York Times more widely
available on the day of publica
tion," Sulzberger said. "The in
auguration of our new interna
tional edition in Paris, which gives
readers in Europe 'Today's New
York Times Today," has led to
consideration of publishing on the
West Coast."
SULZBERGER added that "We
must, of course, first satisfy our
selves that the reader demand and
advertising opportunity are suf
ficent to make such an enterprise
soundly self-supporting."
A petition was circulated at
Stanford last year asking the
Times to establish a West Coast
edition. Similar petitions were cir
culated in the rest of the Bay
Area.
