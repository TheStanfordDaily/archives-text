little land, and too few resources," according to Issei Saito, Japa
nese Vice Consul who spoke here yesterday on "Japan and Her
Foreign Relations."
Saito believes the major solution to Japan's problems lies in

expansion of foreign trade which j
would enable her to import more !
of the needed raw materials and !
export more of her industrial \
products. He also named emigra
tion as an important solution to
the populated problem.
SAITO pointed out that Japan
had these problems before World
War II and at that time she tried
to solve them by force. "Japan
now knows that the only solution
lies in maintaining the friendship
of I he rest of the world," he said. I
According to Saito, the two
major points in Japanese foreign !
policy are support for the U.N. !
and friendship with the nations of j
the world.

rioting over the ratification of
the U.S. security treaty. Saito
blamed the Japanese Socialist
Party which blocked the treaty
in an effort to maintain strict ;
neutrality.

trality cannot exist in a modern
world which has both democracy
and communism." he said. "The
Socialist Party is playing into the
hands of the Communists."

pants in the riots were for the
most part laborers and students
who "are often misguided by un
conscientious journalism."

action in controlling the riots,
Saito saifl that due to its loss of
prestige after the last war. "when
the government tries to control
violence now. it gets strong op
position on the grounds of un
democratic conduct."

"There are three basic facts about Japan: too many people, too
little land, and too few resources," according to Issei Saito, Japa
nese Vice Consul who spoke here yesterday on "Japan and Her
Foreign Relations."
Saito believes the major solution to Japan's problems lies in

expansion of foreign trade which j
would enable her to import more !
of the needed raw materials and !
export more of her industrial \
products. He also named emigra
tion as an important solution to
the populated problem.
SAITO pointed out that Japan
had these problems before World
War II and at that time she tried
to solve them by force. "Japan
now knows that the only solution
lies in maintaining the friendship
of I he rest of the world," he said. I
According to Saito, the two
major points in Japanese foreign !
policy are support for the U.N. !
and friendship with the nations of j
the world.
In discussing last summer's |
rioting over the ratification of
the U.S. security treaty. Saito
blamed the Japanese Socialist
Party which blocked the treaty
in an effort to maintain strict ;
neutrality.
"IT IS ( LKAK that strict neu
trality cannot exist in a modern
world which has both democracy
and communism." he said. "The
Socialist Party is playing into the
hands of the Communists."
Saito pointed out that partici
pants in the riots were for the
most part laborers and students
who "are often misguided by un
conscientious journalism."
In discussing his government's
action in controlling the riots,
Saito saifl that due to its loss of
prestige after the last war. "when
the government tries to control
violence now. it gets strong op
position on the grounds of un
democratic conduct."
IN ( ON( LI DINt; his remark;-

on the riots, Saito observed that
al the present time, "the over
whelming majority of the Japa
nese people suport the govern
ment and its security treaty with
the U.S."
Saito's talk was the third of a
series of orientation programs for
the Stanford students visiting
Japan this summer under the
auspices of Keio University.
