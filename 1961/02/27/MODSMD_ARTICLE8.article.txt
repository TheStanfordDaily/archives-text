### 
PULLMAN, Wash. (UPI) —Washington State University will not
recognize any fraternity or sorority which imposes racial or re
ligious restrictions on membership after Sept. 1, President C. Cle
ment French has announced.
French said all but three of the Greek letter groups on the cam-

pus already had abolished such
restrict ions.
The others, he said, had made
"sincere" efforts to have such
clauses stricken from their na
tional constitutions and felt they
could do so by the Sept. 1 dead
line.
THE THREE which still have
restricting clauses were identified
as Alpha Tau Omega, Sigma Chi j
and Sigma Nu. all men's groups, i
The 13 women's groups all have!
dominated any such restrictions, i
French said the university had
no intention of.forcing any group
to pledge any particular individ
ual. "We want assurance that a
student's race, religion and ethnic
qrigin will not bar him from con
sideration for membership." he
said.
STANFORD chapters of the
three fraternities involved were
asked for comments.
Mike Kavanaugh, ATO presi
dent, stated that ATO has a
waiver clause in its national con
stitution, under which any chapter
under pressure from its univer
sity can request that the restric
tive clause be waived so as no
longer to affect that particular
chapter.
"1 imagine this' is what the
WSU chapter will do, take ad
vantage of the under-pressure
waiver clause," he said.
SAII) BILL Butler. Sigma Nu
House secretary and spokesman
on matters of anti-discrimination.
"Sigma Nu chapters may apply
for an informal waiver of their
constitution's restrictive clause if
they find it necessary."
He emphasized that, although
not formal, as in the case of the
ATO's, the waiver is available,
and that such a waiver is in effect
at Stanford and California state
schools.
"DISCRIMINATION will again
be attacked at the 1962 national
convention," he said, "but South
ern chapters will of course re
sist. However, the balance of the
votes may have swung to the
North and West by then."
It is not known, Butler indi
cated, whether the Southern chap
ters would then secede from the
national—"but probably not."
Neither Jack Burke, new Sigma
Chi president, nor John Bunnell,
vice president, was available for
comment.
