! NEW AUTO INSURANCE I
SAVINGS ANNOUNCED
Savings up to $120 on automobile
insurance are now common for mar
ried men under 25 years of age
with the California Casualty In
demnity Exchange.
"Married men in this ago bracket
arc generally paying excessivo pre
miums for the degree of risk in- i
volved," says George M. Campbell, j
Campus Representative for the Ex- |
change
"We believe that a married man
with family responsibilities is a
more careful driver, and causes
fewer accidents," said Campbell. J
"Therefore, he fc entitled to rates
for mature drivers."
For example: A married man, age
22 with Bodily Injury Liability
$10/20,000, Property Damage
$5,000 and Medical $500 pays
about $157 a year with most in
surance companies With Califor
nia Casualty he would pay about
$80 less $16 dividend, or a net of
j $64 (based on current 20 per cent
[ dividend). Thus he saves about j
$93 with the Exchange. (Other
coverages with comparable sav
ings).
Campbell declared that even un
married men and women with good
driving records may save over 20
per cent.
