# Illness Hits Durand; Poisoning Possible
## 
### 
Sixteen Durand House girls were stricken yesterday with what
University Health Service officials called a brief attack of possible
food poisoning.
The girls became sick yesterday morning but with one exception
were well enough last night to skip soup doctors had ordered pre-

pared for them and cat a normal
dinner.
TIIK CASIO was tho second one
of mass sickness to hit the house
in little more than a month.
Twenty-three girls, five hashers
and the house cook suffered mild
food poisoning January 22.
Almost 100 students fell sick
January 20 from food poisoning
after eating at Encina Dining
Hall.
In yesterday's case. Dr. Maurice
M. Osborne, a Health Service phy
sician, said the girls became ill
with cramps and diarrhea early,
most of them starting to feel sick
in morning classes.
The Health Service was not no
tified until 4:40 in the afternoon,
Osborne said, since the girls ap
parent ly did not realize how wide
spread the trouble was until then.
HEALTH Service Director Dr.
George H. Houck and Osborne re-1
sponded to the call for aid and j
later ordered soup cooked for
those who were sick.
But all except one of the girls:
felt well enough to pass up the j
soup and eat a regular dinner, j
Osborne said.
University Health Officer Hal
Wilson will supervise cooking at
the house for the next three or
four days to make sure all cor
rect health precautions are being j
observed and to try to find out j
the reason for the recent trouble.
OSBORNE said the definite
cause of the sickness won't be I
pinned down until Wilson has!
completed his investigation of the!
incident, and the food is exam-,
ined.
But he said the illness probably ;
stemmed from something the
girls ate, and if it was a meal at j
the house it was probably the
Sunday night dinner.
That meal included roast beef,
string beans, spinach and pota
toes. Not all of the girls who ate 1
that meal became sick, however. >
