nology Corp. of Sunnyvale, was
president of the American Rocket
Society last year.
He left for Paris Sunday to at
tend a meeting of the Interna
tional Astronautical Federation,
parent organization of the acad

last summer at the federation's
Stockholm meeting.
Seifert is vice president of the
federation and head of the U.S.

Von Karman said, "not on the ba
sis of their nationality."
Prof. Joshua Lederberg of the
Medical School, a Nobel laureate,
was elected earlier to the acad
