# HCUA Probe Power OK'd By Court; Tactics Assailed

### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) â€”A sharply split Supreme Court reaffirmed
yesterday the right of the House Committee on Un-American Activi
ties to investigate communism. But the committee's tactics were
assailed sharply by the dissenting justices.
By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld contempt of Congress convictions

against Frank Wilkinson of Los
Angeles and Carl Braden of Louis
ville, Ky., who refused to answer
questions put to Ihom by a sub
committee in Atlanta in 1938.
JUSTICE Hugo L. Black, mark
ing his 75th birthday yesterday,
led the dissenters with a vigorous
criticism of the committee's prac
tices. Ho was joined by Chief
Justice Earl Warren and Justices
William O. Douglas and William
J. Brennan Jr.
For the majority, Justice Potter
Stewart cited a 1959 court deci
sion which dealt exhaustively with
the right of congressional com
mittees to inquire into commu
nism. That ruling upheld the con
tempt conviction of Lloyd Baren
blatt. former Vassal' College in
structor who defied the House
group during a hearing on com
munism in education.
Black objected with these
words: "In my view, the conclu
sion is inescapable that the only
real limitation upon the commit
tee's power to harass its op
ponents is the committee's own
self-restraint, a characteristic
which probably has not been pre
dominant in the committee's work
over the past few years."
HK SAID this means iiiat from
now on anyone who disagrees
with the committee runs the risk
of being subpoenaed, asked to re
peat gossip he has heard about
any of his friends, held up to the
public as a subversive and a trai
tor, jailed for contempt and
"branded by his neighbors, em
ployer and erstwhile friends as a
menace to society."
Douglas, in another separate
dissent, suggested that editors
could be summoned before the
committee and "made to account
for their editorials denouncing the
committee."
HOWEVER, Stewart said the
subcommittee had a legitimate
legislative interest at its hearing
on Communist propaganda in the
South and Red infiltration into
the textile industry. He said it
wanted to find out about "the
manipulation and infiltration of
activities and organizations by
organizations by persons advo
cating overthrow of the govern
ment."
Wilkinson issued a statement
saying "the committee will some
day be abolished. The First
Amendment will be restored to
full vigor. The court's minority
will in due time become the ma
jority. Wo will not save free
speech if we are not prepared to
go to jail in its defense."
Braden said in view of the "vig
orous dissent delivered by the
minority in this ease, we will ask
for a rehearing from the Supreme
Court."
WILKINSON, 45. refused to an
swer a question whether he had
ever been a Communist on
grounds of conscience rather than
ihe Fifth Amendment's protec
tion against self-incrimination.
The former Los Angeles housing
official said yesterday's decision
means the majority of the court
"has sanctioned the committee's
efforts to silence its critics."
