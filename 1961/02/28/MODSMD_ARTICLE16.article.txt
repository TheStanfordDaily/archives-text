# Two Africans Challenged to Perform Task
## 
### 
I have a question which I did
not get a chance to ask while at
tending the "Tribute To Lumum
ba" meeting at Kepler's Book
store last Friday night. I direct it
at the two African students and
indirectly at the Socialist Caucus.
It is all very fine, and I am sym
pathetic to, the erstwhile great
ness of Patrice Lumumba and the
deep feeling this tragedy has left
with his people. It is a fact that
the Belgians left the Congo ill
prepared to assume the task of
governing themselves — ill-pre
pared to such a degree that per
haps they could be charged with
criminal neglect. This is in the
past.
The task you are charged with
is to build a country. You do not
need revolutionaries. You do not
need orators. Heady accusations
directed to the U.S., Belgium, the
rich industrailists, the U.N., the
middle-class, the newspapers—
these will not build a country.
Ralph Bunche recalls that while
he was directing the U.N. in the
Congo, a few of Lumumba's cab
inet ministers walked into the
U.N. offices and asked if they
could sit there for the next two
days—so that they could find out
what one was supposed to do in
an office. Herein lies your prob
lem. You MUST obtain people who
can run a government. This is
YOUR responsibility. You must
find real leaders who will devote
themselves to setting up educa
tional systems, promoting eco
nomic growth, establishing health
programs, and attracting more |
trained personnel.
My question to you is this; how
do you plan to do this? Your
country, all of Africa, has a des
perate need of people such as
yourselves. Every second of your
time here will be worth months;
and lives when you return. Do not
waste your time issuing polemics
against history. Do not wast your
time memorializing dead people,
leaders, or things. Or picketing
the Belgian Consulate. Your time
is much too valuable!
Think, talk, be, act, construc- j
tively. Not destructively. Don't ex- ;
pec-t the world to come running to j
your assistance. The world has i
never done that. Think, instead, of j
ways in which you can attract !
help and financial aid.
See if you can get American stu
dents to go to Africa, write your
government to see what they
could do with such people—per
haps you could recruit a whole
boatload. Talk with American bus
iness firms —who knows, perhaps
you could persuade the Campbell
Soup Company to build a soup |
factory in the Congo or would
you refuse that?
Freedom is yours now, ready
or not. At this point, you must
have help if you are to survive. |
And somewhere, somehow, this |
help has to be paid for. What
ideas, what plans do you have for
obtaining this help?
The very least you could have
done last Friday night was to
have taken up a collection to send
a tax expert to the Congo so that
the government!?) could obtain
some revenue which is being lost
at the present moment due to
lack of trained personnel. Or
would the Socialists prefer a dem
onstration at 444 California St?
Prefer a demonstration to a dona
tion? Turbulence to stability?
