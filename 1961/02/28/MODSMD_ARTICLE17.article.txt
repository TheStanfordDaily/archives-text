# Discovers One Polite Student
## 
### 
There is on Stanford campus
at least one polite student, a
young woman (quite pretty, inci
dentally) who obviously can read,
has memory retention, and acts
either from thoughtfulness or
from safety. This morning she
waited at the curb for my car to
complete a righthand turn in
front of her. Such behavior is un
usual, limited to this one incident,
in my experience of driving these
campus streets. It was pointed
out in contrast to the six wander
ing students who strolled across
the intersection in front of my
leading bumper.
I gave her a smile of apprecia
tion at the time; let me now say,
"Thank you. Your action makes
me a believer once again in the
awareness and consideration of a
student."
I would like one day to address
myself to the cyclists (they ride
bicycles). But this is a letter of
appreciation, and the cyclist theme
emphatically does not belong ad
jacent to a sincere "thank you."
