# Disappointed at Ineffectiveness Of Kennedy Administration
## 
### 
The rather optimistic views of
such sterling bastions of political
thought as was reflected in the
pages of The Stanford Daily
under the directorship of Barry
Greenberg concerning such mat
ters as Kennedy's potential as a
President, is open, at this point
to some review.
Mr. Kennedy is carefully pick
ing his way into the presidency,
and perhaps a little too carefully,
i according to some lights. I per
sonally feel it necessary to with
hold judgment of more than the
most tentative sort; but I cannot
but admit that as of today I am
a tiny bit disappointed. I did not
think, first of all, that it was
either necessary or desirable to
roach right into the heart of the
Eisenhower administration for a
Secretary of the Treasury, espe
cially when such rational basis as
Mr. Kennedy had developed in
support of his candidacy lay in
the shortcomings of that very ad
ministration. I was even more dis
enchanted at the appointment of
Mr. McNamara, not only a Re
publican himself but a big rich
industrial manager cut out of sub
stantially the same mold as the
thoroughly discredited Engine
Charlie Wilson and George
Humphrey. But all that did not of
' necessity cast any doubts on the
actual handling of the most fun
i damental responsibilities of the !
presidency. After all, a good many
other strong presidents have quite |
successfully managed to utilize
the talents of men of ability while ;
forcing the submergence of such
| men's philosophical antipathies to 1
their own. The respects in which
I find myself less and less pleased
with Mr. Kennedy are what at
this stage give the impression of
the sort of unwillingness to act
with the forthrightness and vigor
that so many of us hoped for.
i In his press conference of yes
terday, for instance, when he was
questioned as to his intent in "ex
| ercising the moral force of the
presidency" in the problems of
school desegregation, his answer
1 might just as well have been ab
stracted for an Eisenhower press
conference of some time in the
past eight years. That is to say,
he assured his listeners, exactly
as had Mr. Eisenhower a dozen
times or more, that it was his
strongly held belief that every
child should enjoy the right to
the maximum of intellectual and
spiritual and social growth under
the most beneficial of circum
stances.
Why didn't he say, as he indi
cated time and again during the

campaign that Mr. Eisenhower
should have done, just as bluntly
as this, that it was the full satu
tory responsibility of the govern
ment to assure that the 14th
amendment as construed by our
supreme court be complied with
in every instance and that by God
come whatever he was going to
see to it that was exactly what
was done. Again, the image of
himself as the complete master of
his house has suffered serious
diminution in the comedy of er
rors of the last couple of days in
the case of the argument about
the reality of the "missile gap"
that he made quite a bit of during
the campaign. Mr. McNamara
held a press conference in which
he gave out information indicating
that this administration had, in
effect, discovered that Mr. Ken
nedy had not known a damn
thing he was talking about during
the campaign when he made vari
ous charges of laxness and incom
petence in the then administra
tion's handling of the missile pro
gram. Yesterday, Mr. Kennedy
told the boys that his administra
tion had not completed its studies
and had no definitive judgments
on the matter until such studies
had been completed. All very
proper, but what of Mr. Mc-
Namara and his foot in mouth so
beautifully reminiscent of his in
effable predecessor, Charlie Wil
son?
And then there's the matter of
the two arrogant paleothic gentle
men from Virginia and their spir
itual blood brothers in the Senate
and the House of Representatives.
Both "Judge" Smith and Senator
Byrd have made very clear that
however much Mr. Kennedy
scrapes and kowtows to the
wishes and desires for patronage
of themselves and the other mem
bers of the mint julep and mag
nolia bloc, they intend to use
every power at their disposal to
forestall every single one of the
labors of first priority as deline
ated in the Democratic platform
and in Mr. Kennedy's speeches.
But does Mr. Kennedy throw
down the gauntlet to these fel
lows and kick their teeth in right
now when logically his chances to
do so are at their best? Not by a
damned sight; he treated "Judge"
Robertson with all the deference
due Winston Churchill. Of course,
it may be that he assesses the
situation as being one of certain
defeat foi himself and program if
he allows it to take on the colors
of a fight at this time and is bid
ing his time until he does think
a victory possible. We'll have to
give him the benefit of the doubt
right now, but I can't help feeling
let down.
The press has been so uniformly
happy with Mr. Kennedy's ap
points that I have found it impos
sible not to feel some vague
doubts just on that account alone.
After all, it is not the habit of
the American press to express
great joy at the accession to
power of any but men of exactly
the character so perfectly ex
pressed in the persons of George
Humphrey and his kind. And
while no long list of dubiously
competent and dubiously moral
appointments can be made, such
malcontents as Drew Pearson
have called attention to one or
two that would not do much credit
to Boss Pendergast himself.
Adding to the record in this latter
regard is the manner which Mr.
Kennedy went out of his way re
cently to extoll the merits of New
York Congressman Adam Clayton
Powell, and give support to him.
The clearly objective facts in the
matter are that no possible justi
fication in philosophy or ethics or'
even immediately practical poli
tics exists for such action. The
very best that I can say for it is
that it is a purely cynical play for
as many as possible of the votes
of the most ignorant and salable
of Negroes and Puerto Ricans in
future elections when Mr. Powell
can presumably deliver them.
Hardly, we like to think, the way
George Washington would have
acted.
