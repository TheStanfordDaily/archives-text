Jim Hoenig's justification of j
Mayor Wagner's action in forbid-!
ding a Nazi rally seems somewhat !
lamo. It may be true that Wag
ner's action was "for their own
protection," but isn't Rockwell, an
adult male, able to make his own
decisions about what risks hej
wants to take?
As an alternative, the Mayor
could have provided an extra j
heavy police guard ho could even j
have called for federal help. We
have a million and a half men j
under arms who are allegedly de
fending our freedomâ€”surely they
could defend the freedom of Cen
tral Park.
