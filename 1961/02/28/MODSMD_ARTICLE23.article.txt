# Japanese Grad Backs ATO on Discrimination
## 
### 
In the Chronicle, Jan. 27th, I
happened to read about my good
old ATOs. I was very pleased to
know that some of your country
men are really moving ahead and
that this is happening on Stanford
Campus and at the place where
I spent my precious year as the
third exchange student from Keio.
As may it sound presumptuous,
I don't hesitate to claim myself
as the one who led the happiest
life as a foreign student in the
year 158-59. This was only be
cause I was in the good hands of
ATO, Breakers, and many other
of our good old Stanfordites.
From four hours exam to paper
writing, from water bombing of
Guthrie House to weekend parties
they all come back to me ever
' vividly even now if I close my
I eyes. But one of the most fruit
ful experiences was that I ob
served with my own eyes the
brewing desire to abolish the ra
cial snobery among those students
I came to know. Since I returned
I never failed to cite this as the
proof to hamper terrible myths
against your country.
On this occasion particularly I
want you to realize that the ATO
case has already become the cen
ter of world wide attentions and
that you all concerned are ex
pected to take a measure accord
ing to your own reason. Many of
the returnees' from Farm are
watching the case very anxiously.
I want you to prove that Stanford
is always moving ahead and never
decide anything only to the satis
faction of those who think and
act in terms of 50 years ago.
