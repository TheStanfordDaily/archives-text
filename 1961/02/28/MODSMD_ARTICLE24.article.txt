# Show Director Criticized for Dropping Act
## 
### 
We, the Philippine students,
feel that we owe the audience and
our invited guests an explanation
over our failure* to appear on
stage during the International
Cabaret at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium last Sunday, Feb. 19.
About to start her first dance,
Ester Timbancaya was unable to
proceed further because the musi
cal accompaniment had been mis
takenly played at the middle.
Whereupon (refusing Miss Tim
bancaya's request for a restart),
John Harrop, director of the show,
decided not only to do away with
the dance completely, but also
with the rest of the Philippine
participation (two other dances
and a song) altogether. When
queried this was Harrop's reply:
"This is my show and I will not
allow any amateurish slip to spoil
it."
We maintain that it was not
Mr. Harrop's show. We maintain
that it was not a professional
show, as he seemed to imply, to
be handled with cold, detached
professional flair. We believe that,
above all, it was a cooperative
endeavor among the international
students at Stanford to entertain
and acquaints the American pub
lic with various aspects of their
cultures, although its immediate
purpose was to raise funds for
the International Center.
In view of the foregoing, we
feel that the International Cabaret
should not have been managed by
John Harrop (Esq.) with such
imperial authority.
