# Demonstration Has Worth
## 
### 
The sudden appearance of a
low-keyed student demonstration
in front of the Navy Air Force ex
hibit last Friday interested me
very much. The awkward solem
nity of the picketing students con
trasted favorably to the amateur
ish heckling and silly remarks I
heard among many of the on
lookers in the few minutes I stood
near the demonstrators. Hope
fully, the pickets gained some
more sensible reflection on the
part of the more subdued students
there.
Although picketing, demonstra
tions, and the like, are not a form
of political action I admire very
much (witness the cross-purpose
to which the City Hall "riots"
have been subjected), it seems
that such ideals as peace and dis
armament cannot break through
the hard-driving, well-rationalized

military juggernauts of the U.S.
and Ihe Soviet without resort to
such crude methods. Such "talk
talk" about peace as has been
prevalent during the past 15 years
has obviously had no serious ef
fect on our policy-making.
Perhaps only such spontaneous
demonstrations as this on Friday
can gradually work their demand
for constructive thinking toward
a reasonable peace into our com
mon mentality. For I certainly
hope these students are not nega
tivists in the sway of "unilateral
disarmament" thinking, but are,
rather, positivists searching for
means toward a structured and
lasting peace.
