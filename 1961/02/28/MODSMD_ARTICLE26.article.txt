# Alternative Available to SF Papers

The editorial in Friday's Daily
states that readers in the Bay
Area have no alternative to the
"irresponsible" San Francisco pa
pers. 1 would like to point out thai
at least one highly responsible
newspaper is available lo Stanford
students at less than half the cosl
of either The Chronicle or The
Examiner. I refer to the Christian
Science Monitor, the third-ranked
U.S. newspaper, which is available
to students by mail one day late at
a cost of $2.50 for three months.
Subscriptions to this California
edition may be obtained at the
Christian Science Reading Room
at 570 Ramona in Palo Alto.
The same Daily editorial comes
out with a forthright stand for
journalistic improvement. We
may assume the editors know
where to begin. One specific sug
gestion is that letters to the Daily
be published immediately. Previ
ous editors have overcome prob

lems of space, and so should this ]
one. Under present Daily policy J
meaningful controversy is lost in j
an interim, of several days be
tween the expression of an opin-'
ion and the printed reader re-j
sponse. An issue is dead or ihe
views attacked are forgotten be
fore the pertinent letters can be
read. Such delay may bo protec
tive, but to impair debate and
criticism in this way is hardly
i "responsible."
