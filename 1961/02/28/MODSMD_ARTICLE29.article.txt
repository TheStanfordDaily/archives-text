# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION

As I entered his office the man with the blond crew cut was check
ing comparative times and he was mumbling.
"We're going 1o have our hands full with San Jose State Wednes
day (tomorrow).
TIIK SUPERBLY conditioned fellow behind the thick spectacles
was Jim Gaughran, Stanford's new head swimming coach. Gaughran
is a very likeable guy who seemingly would be a natural to inspire
swimmers both through hi-s own past deeds and his humble sincerity.
Having succeeded Tom Haynie as water sports mentor on the
Farm this year when Haynie left for the Punaho School in Honolulu,
Hawaii, the 28-year-old coach is in tremendous shape and could prob
ably whip off a pretty fast hundred right now.
"When I heard that Haynie was leaving I talked and wrote to A 1

Masters-the athletic director
because I've always wanted to
coach here," he told me.
"I guess I made myself enough
of a pest that they hired me."
There is a little more to the
story than the modest Gaughran
mentioned.
Tin: YOUTHFUL coach was a
fabulous swimmer at Stanford
from 1951 through 1954. Captain
of both the water polo and swim
ming teams in his senior year, he
was name to the All-American
swimming and the All-Pacific
Coast Conference water polo
teams for two consecutive years.
While hero, he set a national col
legiate swim record in the 120-
yard individual medley and Pa
cific Coast Conference records <n
the 100-yard freestyle and the 150-
yard individual medley.
Following his graduation in

1954, Gaughran served four times as captain of the San Francisco
Olympic Club water polo team, and from 1955-59 was named to the
All-America Water Polo Team. He was a member of the 1956 United
States Olympic Water Polo Squad at Melbourne.
Attorney as Well as Coach
Gaughran's quick smile assumed an enchanting quality when
I queried him about his appointment to head coach. You see he was
a Deputy Attorney General for the S'ate of California for the past
three years.
"I'VK ALWAYS loved swimming and have been connected with
it as long as I can remember," he replied, "but I've always planned
on my law career also.
"I coached the varsity for the national championships for about
a month in 1955 when Haynie went to Mexico to help train the
American team for the Pan-American games and I truly enjoyed it.
When I heard the position was open last summer that's when i went
to see A 1 Masters.
"When I got the job I quit Ihe attorney general position to simul
taneously open my own office in Redwood City. My law partner is
Austin Clapp and he understands how I feel. He was an Ail-American
swimmer for Stanford and was a national champion in 1932.
"You might say,"' he grinned, "that we have a very compatible
arrangement."
Gaughran in just a short time here has earned the respect of his
team and it has shown in hard work and improving times. When
Olympic gold medal winner George Harrison was declared ineligible
on the eve of the first meet the pensive coach took the news in stride.
There have been no excuses. There is a job to he done and the new
coach is doing it.

Attorney as Well as Coach
Gaughran's quick smile assumed an enchanting quality when
I queried him about his appointment to head coach. You see he was
a Deputy Attorney General for the S'ate of California for the past
three years.
"I'VK ALWAYS loved swimming and have been connected with
it as long as I can remember," he replied, "but I've always planned
on my law career also.
"I coached the varsity for the national championships for about
a month in 1955 when Haynie went to Mexico to help train the
American team for the Pan-American games and I truly enjoyed it.
When I heard the position was open last summer that's when i went
to see A 1 Masters.
"When I got the job I quit Ihe attorney general position to simul
taneously open my own office in Redwood City. My law partner is
Austin Clapp and he understands how I feel. He was an Ail-American
swimmer for Stanford and was a national champion in 1932.
"You might say,"' he grinned, "that we have a very compatible
arrangement."
Gaughran in just a short time here has earned the respect of his
team and it has shown in hard work and improving times. When
Olympic gold medal winner George Harrison was declared ineligible
on the eve of the first meet the pensive coach took the news in stride.
There have been no excuses. There is a job to he done and the new
coach is doing it.

was Jim Gaughran, Stanford's new head swimming coach. Gaughran
is a very likeable guy who seemingly would be a natural to inspire
swimmers both through hi-s own past deeds and his humble sincerity.
Having succeeded Tom Haynie as water sports mentor on the
Farm this year when Haynie left for the Punaho School in Honolulu,
Hawaii, the 28-year-old coach is in tremendous shape and could prob
ably whip off a pretty fast hundred right now.
"When I heard that Haynie was leaving I talked and wrote to A 1

Masters-the athletic director
because I've always wanted to
coach here," he told me.
"I guess I made myself enough
of a pest that they hired me."
There is a little more to the
story than the modest Gaughran
mentioned.
Tin: YOUTHFUL coach was a
fabulous swimmer at Stanford
from 1951 through 1954. Captain
of both the water polo and swim
ming teams in his senior year, he
was name to the All-American
swimming and the All-Pacific
Coast Conference water polo
teams for two consecutive years.
While hero, he set a national col
legiate swim record in the 120-
yard individual medley and Pa
cific Coast Conference records <n
the 100-yard freestyle and the 150-

Following his graduation in

1954, Gaughran served four times as captain of the San Francisco

All-America Water Polo Team. He was a member of the 1956 United
