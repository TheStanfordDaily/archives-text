Stanford's rugby team won its
seventh and eighth straight vic
tories of ihe season by beating
USC's Trojans and the UCLA
Bruins by 15-7 and 17-11 scores
respectively down in Smogville
last weekend.
The win brought Card Coach
Pete Kmetovic's ruggers' record
to 8-0 and left them the only re
maining undefeated N o r t h e r n
California Rugby Union team.
California, previously the only
other squad with an unblemished
mark, lost to the University of
British Columbia, 8-3, at Berkeley
i Saturday.
AGAINST the Uclans, the In
dians struck early for two quick
■scores as front ranker John
Thomas made a try after the
j Tribe scrum powered the ball
close to the Bruins' goal.
Kyrk Reid's conversion attempt
was no good, but the Cards soon
managed another score when
Troy Barbee made the Tribe's sec
ond try from his second rank spot.
Reid's conversion was good to
boost Stanford to a fast 8-0 lead.
The Bruins' Bill Ludwig broke
the scoring ice for UCLA by dash
ing for a try. and Peter Nicklin
from South Africa converted to
cut the Indians' margin to three
counters.
BUT STANFORD'S Reid sent
the Cards off the field at halftime
with an 11-5 bulge by kicking his
first of three penalty kicks for
the day.
All told, the hooker scored 11
points, which combined with his
I six counters against USC gave
him a total of 17 for his weekend's
work.
The second half was a kicking
battle between Reid and Nicklin,
each man kicking two penalty
boots apiece as the referee called
a very close game.
Friday against the Trojans,
Stanford duplicated its Saturday
feat by scoring two quick tries.
First. Jack McCullough picked up
a loose ball in the USC end zone
for a try, and Reid added the
conversion.
THEN, minutes later, break
away Steve Pursell fell on an
other loose pigskin for a second
try, and the infallible Reid booted
his second conversion to send the
Indians off to an early 10-0 bulge.
In the second period, the Tribe
ruggers got their final score of
the game when wing Larry Royse
pop kicked down field to Hal Steu
ber, who promptly reeled off a
40-yard scoring dash, and Reid
added the conversion.
USC's only score came on a long
pass and rush play that ended
with A1 Tobin making the try. Bob
Smith kicked the extra two points
for the Trojans.
THE TROJAN scrum was one
of the biggest and strongest that
the Cards have faced all year but
were hurt by their inexperience.
The same was true of the El
Troje backs as they often threw
away the ball.
In a match played on the Stan-1
ford rugby field Saturday, the
Stanford JV ruggers scored a 14-0 '
win over the Santa Clara Broncos
for their seventh win without a
loss. Jerry Cronin was the stick
