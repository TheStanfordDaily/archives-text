# 2 Germanys in UN? 'Never' Says Consul

### LINDA HESS 
Question: "What would happen
if both Germanys were admitted
to the U.N.?" San Francisco Con
sul-General Franz Breer's answer
was concise and to the point:
"There is only one Germany."
The occasion was last night's
panel discussion on "Berlin To
day," the first of a series of ac
tivities in the lIR-German Club
sponsored Berlin Week. Partici
pating with Dr. Breer on the
panel were Dr. Jerome Kuehl.
visiting professor of history, and
Dr. Gordon Wright, executive
head of the history department.
ALTHOUGH the prevailing at
titude is that the West has a
moral obligation to protect West
Berlin against Soviet aggression,
the legal reasons behind the pres
ent military occupation of the
city are devoid of moral signifi
cance. It is this confusion over
the real reasons behind continued
occupation which, according to
Kuehl, has kept the West from
maintaining the diplomatic upper
hand in Germany.
WRIGHT reviewed some of the
proposed solutions to the prob
lems of a divided Berlin, but con
cluded that "none of the solutions
is likely to be accepted by both
sides." The proposals range<AH i om
turning Germany over to United

Nations control, to transporting
the whole city of Berlin to a new
location.
Pointing out the numerous pro
posals that the West has debated
in recent years, Wright said that
Khrushchev is probably in favor
of such internal disagreements
among the Western powers. "Per
haps thinking up solutions to the
Berlin problem is a kind of sub
versive activity that Khrushchev
encourages to divert us from the
real problem of German unity."
GERMAN consul a r official
Brcer agreed that the USSR is
doing its best to draw West Ber
lin and eventually all of Germany
into t he Soviet bloc. Ho referred to
Russian strategy since World
War II as "salami tactics taking
Europe and the free world slice
by slice."
BUT IF each of the three panel
members highlighted different as
pects of the Berlin situation, all
were agreed on one point: it is
vital that the Western powers
maintain their position in Berlin.
