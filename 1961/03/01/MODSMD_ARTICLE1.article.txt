The newest revolution's academic.
It's the "trimester plan" pioneered at the University of Pitts
burgh and under study at nearly 100 institutions of higher educa
tion nationwide.
If the plan catches on, it means that a student will be able to earn

a bachelor's degree in two and
two-thirds years — compared to
the usual four academic years
now required.
BUT THAT'S not all. 11' a stu
dent spends four years in a tri
mesteri/ed school, lie can stick to
the books for just 15 more weeks
and have a Ph.D.
The trimester plan, brainchild
of Pitt's chancellor, Dr. Edward
H. Litchfield, tinkers with the old
academic calendar, telescopes time
and puts in the place of two se
mesters a year three 15-week
learning sessions—trimesters.
Litchfield said in an interview
that the trimester system also
means higher income for faculty
members who want to teach
around the calendar—plus more
efficient use of classrooms, labo
ratories and other costly academic
facilities short in supply.
TINKERING with the old aca
demic calendar was begun at Pitt
in 1957. The blueprint that
emerged after much study was
put to the test on a limited scale
last year.
It was expected that 3,000 stu
dents would take advantage of
the third term. But 5,000 signed
up.
All who signed up felt the tri
mester system would help them
attain their professional goals
earlier—and more efficiently.
Said another way: new doctors,
sociologists, teachers and other
profesional persons now short in
supply will come off the trimes
terized academic assembly line
faster.
CERTAIN characteristics were
found among students following
the trimester system at Pitt.
Litchfield said more students
in the lower income groups were
interested than in the higher in
come groups. Men were more in
terested than women; older stu
dents, more than younger.
Students who volunteered to
pioneer the trimester system aiso
had in common "average ability"
—plus a willingness to work
harder.
