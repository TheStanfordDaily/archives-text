# Computer Revolution Will Loom Larger Than Political—Hamming
## 
### JUDY SEABORG 
"The computer revolution will
figure larger in history than all
the political revolutions on the
front page today," predicted Prof.
Richard W. Hamming last night
in a Tuesday Evening Series lec
ture to a capacity crowd in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
Hamming, a leading computer
expert and member of the Bell
Telephone Laboratories research,
discussed the intellectual effects
of computers upon engineering re
search and experimentation, lan
guage, education, the creative
arts, and philosophy.
UEC'AUSK one must communi
cate with the machine in "some
mutually understood language"
and in precise detail, it has he
come "a new tool, a new way of
looking at things which more
powerfully exposes our knowl
edge and our ignorance."
Its impact on engineering, be
sides the obvious one of enabling
men In design equipment better
and faster, will be 1<» revolution
ize theory and experimentation.
Engineers w ill be able to see from
a computer what (he results of a
months-long experiment will be.

The responsibility, said Hamming,,
will "never be all on the machine,
but the change will be radical."
The computer is forcing mail to.

analyze his unique invention of
language. Languages, products
of long evolution, are up to 60 per
cent redundant "to protect hum
ans against their unreliable ner
vous systems.''
ALTHOUGH the machines are
only as efficient as the problems
presented to them, by presenting
methods and criteria rather than
specific examples, they have a
greatly increased capacity for de
riving new results.
As for the questions of whether
computers can think and if they
will over take the place of man,
Hamming stated that, the answers
depend mainly upon definitions.
The machines, he said, are capable
of "producing new and novel, but
natural, results." They will, he
added, inevitably take the place
of men who are unable to think
beyond muscle reflexes, and that
this is a problem for sociologists,
but "I think there's a place for
them somewhere."
Education must take the respon
sibility of preparing students to
i live in the machine dominated fu
ture, said Hamming, and to learn
how to use the results it will pro
i duce.
