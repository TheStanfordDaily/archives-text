# No Basic Changes Seen By New IFC President
## 
### 
Sigma Nu Swede Pierson was elected Interfraternity Council
president last Monday night. A runoff with Steel Curry of Delta
Upsilon was necessary to determine the winner.
Mike Hammer, Phi Kappa Sigma, was elected vice president-sec
retary and Roger MacKenzie, Beta Theta Phi, will be the new

rushing chairman.
THE NEW administration is
"not going to change anything
basically" but "hopes to improve
IFC publicity and programs with
the idea of reviving interest in
IFC," said Pierson.
"Too many fraternity men as
well as freshman boys and the
rest of the campus do not know
what is going on in the fratern
ities," he continued. In an effort
to remedy this, the IFC plans to
form a three-man publicity board
to replace the now-existing one
man board.
"We plan to continue and im
prove our faculty-associate pro
gram by having more of them
speak before the men and their
guests."
OTHER plans include a pro
gram in cooperation with Eric
Blitz:, chairman of Men's Council,
to provide judicial boards within
the individual fraternities for non
honor code violations.
"There are two purposes for
this program," explained Pierson.
"One is to put responsibility in
the hands of individual fratern
ities which IFC is encouraging
and the other is to take some of
the heat off Men's Council."
