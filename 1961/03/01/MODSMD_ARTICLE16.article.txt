# Nixon Should Run For Governorship
## 
### 
In the last few weeks it has become increasingly apparent that
former Vice-President Richard Nixon should seek the governorship
of California in 1962. He must do this not only to maintain himself
as the national leader of the Republican Party, but also to prevent
the Republican Party leadership from slipping into the hands of
the type of negative Congressional leadership that Mr. Halleck and
Mr. Dirksen are providing at the present time.
Mr. Nixon's hold on the Republican Party is also being forced
by the liberal Republicans of the eastern seaboard: Mr. Rockefeller,
Senators Javits of New York and Case of New Jersey. They are
filling the vacuum left by the Vice President's lack of comments
while on a deserved vacation from politics in the Bahamas. These
eastern liberals have desperately tried to put forth a higher guality
opposition to Mr. Kennedy's program by suggesting counter pro
posals to the President's legislation and by opposing only those
measures which they sincerely feel are detrimental to the nation's
welfare. Yet they have not succeeded. They, including Mr. Rocke
feller, have neither the stature nor the experience to oppose the
blind negativism of the Halleck-Dirksen leadership in Congress.
The governorship would give Mr. Nixon, a practicable platform
with which he could provide leadership for a Republican Party
sorely in need of first-rate leadership.
Yet in running, Mr. Nixon would also be serving his state as
well as nation. California has been saddled with the flabby leader
ship of Governor Brown for the past two years. In that time he has
bungled the Chessman case; made a political football out of the
water issue; and managed to hold back the California delegation
to the Democratic National Convention in hope of winning a cabi
net post for himself. Mr. Nixon's long years in both houses of
Congress plus his tenure as Vice President would give him the
executive and legislative experience to head a determined, respon
sible state government for the people of California.
The Republican Party, the nation, and the state need the talents
of Mr. Nixon. At 46 his public life is far from being over; his
services are needed.
