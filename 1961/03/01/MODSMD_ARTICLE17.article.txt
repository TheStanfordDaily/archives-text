## Rules Change Transfers Control to Speaker Rayburn 
### 
WASHINGTON—The actions of
the House Rules Committee since
its membership was enlarged !
should make it clear to everyone
that the objective of the enlarge
ment was merely to transfer con
trol of the committee majority
from Chairman Smith to Speaker
Rayburn and the Administration.
Though the Speaker's proposal to
add to the committee membership
was widely represented and ac
cepted as a "liberalizing" move
ment to break legislative bottle
necks, it should now be obvious
that command of the bottleneck
was the only issue.
AFTER THE House by a five
vote margin approved the com
mittee enlargement, the commit
tee has followed Speaker Ray
burn's lead instead of Chairman
Smith's. This was effected by the
Speaker's selection of new Demo
cratic members who could be re
lied on to do that. Accordingly,
Ihe Rules Committee has kept
pent in its bottleneck measures
which the Speaker did not wish
to reach the House floor for a
voting showdown. And there will!
be as many others in the same
category as Rayburn may desig
nate, thus preserving unimpaired
the restrictive function of the
committee over what the entire
House shall consider.
Another very important power
of the Rules Committee was also
left undisturbed. This is the power
to limit the discussion period in
the House on legislation released
1o the floor by the committee. It
includes authority to prescribe
whether any amendments may be
voted on, and if Vo whether
amendments shall beNinly those
offered by the committee which
has the legislation in charge.
THE REASON for preserving
these provinces of the Rules Com
mittee is sound. The jurisdiction
is essential to whatever leadership
group is in control, and is vital to
Ihe Administration when, as in
this instance, the controlling lead
ership group is committed to pro
mote its legislative program. That
is because the size of the House
would make it both unwieldy and
disorderly unless there were rigid
regulation of its floor traffic.
Also, the Rules Committee regu
larly serves party and personal
interests by using its power to
prevent measures which many
members clamor for publiclv, but'

oppose privately, from coming to
a voting stage. This describes the
following two of the three meas
ures which the enlarged commit
tee has bottled up or modified: a
proposal to open House hearings
to television coverage; a ban on
any Government spending not
specifically appropriated for.
By its third action the Rules
Committee confined to the House,
and banned Senate participation
in, a 'study" of the fuel and en
ergy resources of the United
States. Inevitably entangled in
this study is the issue over re
ducing depletion allowances in the
petroleum industry. Probably a
Senate, though less probably a
House, majority wants to go on
the public as well as the private
record in favor of a considerable
reduction. But the Speaker's Tex
as constituents, and the petroleum
interests in general, will appre
ciate anything he can or will do
to keep this submerged in the re
sources "study" as long as pos
sible.
THIO SHAM in the argument
that the purpose of the commit
tee enlargement was to "liberal
ize" the procedures of the House
has been demonstrated in other
ways since its adoption enabled
the Speaker to take control away
from Chairman Smith. One illus
tration is Smith's poker-faced
counsel to the committee that,
having now been "liberalized," it
must release for floor votes bills
that many members favor but, as
he also knows, the Speaker op-1
poses. Another is the spirited
support given the Chairman's
mocking gesture by Republicans
like Representative Brown of
Ohio whom party colleagues con
fidently rely on to try to bottle up
Administration measures favored
by many more members of the
House.
The whole business from the}
start has been a House power con-1
test between the Kennedy-Ray-j
burn forces and the bipartisan op
position, and it now has been j
stripped of camouflage. The j
Speaker's purpose however, un
like its representation as designed
solely to "liberalize" voting pro
cedure, is legitimate —1o assure
House votes on measures he and j
the Administration want to bring I
to this stage and to choke the
others to death in the Rules Com- i
mittee bottleneck.

be as many others in the same
category as Rayburn may desig
nate, thus preserving unimpaired
the restrictive function of the
committee over what the entire
House shall consider.
Another very important power
of the Rules Committee was also
left undisturbed. This is the power
to limit the discussion period in

includes authority to prescribe
whether any amendments may be
voted on, and if Vo whether
amendments shall beNinly those

THE REASON for preserving
these provinces of the Rules Com
mittee is sound. The jurisdiction
is essential to whatever leadership
group is in control, and is vital to
Ihe Administration when, as in

mote its legislative program. That
is because the size of the House
would make it both unwieldy and

regulation of its floor traffic.
Also, the Rules Committee regu
larly serves party and personal
interests by using its power to
prevent measures which many
members clamor for publiclv, but'

a voting stage. This describes the
following two of the three meas
ures which the enlarged commit
tee has bottled up or modified: a
proposal to open House hearings
to television coverage; a ban on
any Government spending not
specifically appropriated for.
By its third action the Rules
Committee confined to the House,
and banned Senate participation
in, a 'study" of the fuel and en
ergy resources of the United
States. Inevitably entangled in
this study is the issue over re
ducing depletion allowances in the
petroleum industry. Probably a
Senate, though less probably a
House, majority wants to go on
the public as well as the private
record in favor of a considerable
reduction. But the Speaker's Tex
as constituents, and the petroleum
interests in general, will appre
ciate anything he can or will do
to keep this submerged in the re
sources "study" as long as pos
sible.
THIO SHAM in the argument
that the purpose of the commit
tee enlargement was to "liberal
ize" the procedures of the House
has been demonstrated in other
ways since its adoption enabled
the Speaker to take control away
from Chairman Smith. One illus
tration is Smith's poker-faced
counsel to the committee that,
having now been "liberalized," it
must release for floor votes bills
that many members favor but, as
he also knows, the Speaker op-1
poses. Another is the spirited
support given the Chairman's
mocking gesture by Republicans
like Representative Brown of
Ohio whom party colleagues con
fidently rely on to try to bottle up
Administration measures favored
by many more members of the
House.
The whole business from the}
start has been a House power con-1
test between the Kennedy-Ray-j

WASHINGTON—The actions of
the House Rules Committee since

should make it clear to everyone
that the objective of the enlarge

AFTER THE House by a five

Smith's. This was effected by the
Speaker's selection of new Demo
cratic members who could be re

WASHINGTON—The actions of
the House Rules Committee since
its membership was enlarged !
should make it clear to everyone
that the objective of the enlarge
ment was merely to transfer con
trol of the committee majority
from Chairman Smith to Speaker
Rayburn and the Administration.
Though the Speaker's proposal to
add to the committee membership
was widely represented and ac
cepted as a "liberalizing" move
ment to break legislative bottle
necks, it should now be obvious
that command of the bottleneck
was the only issue.
AFTER THE House by a five
vote margin approved the com
mittee enlargement, the commit
tee has followed Speaker Ray
burn's lead instead of Chairman
Smith's. This was effected by the
Speaker's selection of new Demo
cratic members who could be re
lied on to do that. Accordingly,
Ihe Rules Committee has kept
pent in its bottleneck measures
which the Speaker did not wish
to reach the House floor for a
voting showdown. And there will!
be as many others in the same
category as Rayburn may desig
nate, thus preserving unimpaired
the restrictive function of the
committee over what the entire
House shall consider.
Another very important power
of the Rules Committee was also
left undisturbed. This is the power
to limit the discussion period in
the House on legislation released
1o the floor by the committee. It
includes authority to prescribe
whether any amendments may be
voted on, and if Vo whether
amendments shall beNinly those
offered by the committee which
has the legislation in charge.
THE REASON for preserving
these provinces of the Rules Com
mittee is sound. The jurisdiction
is essential to whatever leadership
group is in control, and is vital to
Ihe Administration when, as in
this instance, the controlling lead
ership group is committed to pro
mote its legislative program. That
is because the size of the House
would make it both unwieldy and
disorderly unless there were rigid
regulation of its floor traffic.
Also, the Rules Committee regu
larly serves party and personal
interests by using its power to
prevent measures which many
members clamor for publiclv, but'

oppose privately, from coming to
a voting stage. This describes the
following two of the three meas
ures which the enlarged commit
tee has bottled up or modified: a
proposal to open House hearings
to television coverage; a ban on
any Government spending not
specifically appropriated for.
