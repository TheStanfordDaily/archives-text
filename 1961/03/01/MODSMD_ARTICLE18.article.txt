## Congress Must Dictate Use of Education Funds 
### 
Since last week when Preside
$5.6 billion federal aid to educati<
lo his defense with statements 1
! federal control over education. Su
| malicious in that they glide over
American politics.
What they fail to recognize or
I perhaps wish to ignore is that
I federal action in any field must
! necessarily be accompained by
| some measure of federal control.
[ This is true because Congress has
| both the prerogative and the duty
j to set up such controls as may be
necessary for the responsible use
! of the taxpayer's money. It is the
j duty of Congress to see that funds
I are spent in such a way as not to
conflict with the interests of the
people.
IN ACCORDANCE with this

responsibility to
the people, Con
gress included
the disclaimer af
fidavit and the
loyalty oath in
the 1958 National
Defense Educa
tion Act. This is
an example of
government con
trol in the field

of e(1 u cat ion. HERMANN
| Also in pursuance of its duties,
I Congress made the receipt of
funds under the act conditional
j upon state compliance with stand
ards and specification laid down
by the Department of Health, Ed
ucation and Welfare another ox- j
ample of federal control that was j
justified by the responsibility of I
Congress to the people to use
their money correctly.
In other words, Congress may
not properly appropriate money
without setting up some condi
tions dictating how it is to be
spent. If Congress passes Ken
nedy's proposed aid to education
bill without adequate controls, it
i will be a serious breach of Con
gressional responsibility and in
tegrity.
The substance of the previously
'mentioned controls is of little im
portance; what is important is
that these controls represent i
legitimate Congressional author- j
ity—an authority which can be j
used as justification for any con
trol measure.
SINCE Congress has a duty to :
t set controls arising out of a re
sponsibility to the people and)
j since this authority can be easily !
abused, education must be han
dled solely at the state and local
i levels if it is to remain completely
I free of federal control.
Yet, we know that some states
: have serious education problems
which are not presently being
solved at the state level. The ques
tion is how can these problems be
solved and what if anything can
the federal government do?
The mess in which many states
and communities find themselves
is directly traceable to the federal
government. The chief problem is
that by the time the federal gov
ernment has claimed its part
of the people's earnings, there is
insufficient money left for the
states to draw upon. Is it any won
der that citizens vote down local
school bonds when the federal
government takes on the average
of one-third of their income? It
is not that they lack the initiative
and desire to improve their
schools; it is rather that they lack
the money after they have been

?nt Kennedy sent to Congress his
ion bill, liberals have been coming
that the program will not extend
uch statements are either naive or
• smoothly an important reality in

pinched annually by the federal
government.
TIIK BEST way—and the only
way—that the federal government
can help the states and the com
munities solve their financial
problems is to reduce taxes. This
can be accomplished by discon
tinuing the farm programs, dras
tically cutting veterans benefits,
and eliminating public housing
and urban renewal expenditures
and a host of other wasteful pro
gram s. Some (such as the
gram program i should be discon
tinued all together; others like
urban renewal might best be han
dled at the local level.
The result of such a tax cut
would be that the communities
would have more money on which
to draw to improve education.
Such a plan would also eliminate
the bureaucrat's c o m mission
which takes a healthy bite out of
all federal lax money.
But most important, there
would then be no question con
cerning where control of educa
tion rests. Money, curriculum, and
personnel matters would continue
to be controlled by those most
acquainted with the unique prob
lems of the particular localities,
and the people would not be forced
into a situation of having to trust
; unquestioningly a distant bureau-
I crat whose interests might not
I always coincide with theirs.
