Feelings Uncontained
Having hold my peace regard
ing several editorials appearing
| in the Daily since the departure
of Editor Barry Greenberg, I find
myself totally unable to contain
my feelings any longer over the
editorial of Monday, Feb. 20th. II
seems to me Editor Parker was
born a couple of hundred years
too late. It also seems to mo that
a University education (I presume
he has had some) has in no way
taught or encouraged him to seek
unbiased Truths, free of pigmen
tation from the cold war. I chal
lenge his competence , to pass a
judgment on the iate Mr. Lu
mumba. I challenge his compe
tence to analyze or oven comment
on the intelligence and judgment
of Africans and Asians. Further,
I question his ability to compre
hend the aspirations and emotions
of a people fighting against cen
turies of oppression and tyranny.
May I ask you a few questions,
Mr. Parker?
1 i Why do Americans, in gen
eral, feel so surprised and shocked
at anti-American demonstrations
in one country after another,
when every day of the year there
is some American or another, like
you, in a position of responsibility,
talking through his hat. on mat
ters he knows nothing about, thus
undoing the good work of hun
dreds of other well-meaning
Americans?
2> What sort of a freedom do
you talk about, that slanders and
insults any man who feels free
enough to exercise his freedom,
and disagrees with your precon
ceived (Americani ideas of free
dom. in the best interests of his
own country, rather than yours?
3) Don't you think that the
title "Self-appointed Guardians of
freedom in the world," usually
linked with the name of your
great country, is a bit erroneous
except for the first two words?
Lastly, may I conclude by say
ing that your above mentioned
editorial was an insult to the in
telligence of the Stanford Com
munity. in general, and the Afri

can and other students who pick
eted the Belgian Embassy, in
particular.

Delighted?
Re: The Federal aid to educa
tion bill.
I was delighted to learn from
Jerry Rankin's column that we
can avoid "increasingly heavy tax
rates" by channeling our taxes
for education through the federal
government, and its expensive,
bureaucratic red tape. With this
compensation a little manner of
unconstitutionality doesn't bother
me at all.
