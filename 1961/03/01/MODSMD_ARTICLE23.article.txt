"LOVE IN REVERSE"
Tlioy mot. His heart leapt. "I love you," ho cried.
"Mo, too, hoy," she cried.
''Toll me," lie cried, '"are you a girl of expensive tastes?"
''No, liov," alio cried, ''1 am :i girl of simple tastes."
'•( lood," lie cried, "for my cruel father sends me an allowance
barely large enough to support life."
"Money does not matter to me, site cried. "My tastes are
simple, my wants are few. Just take me riding in a long, new,
yellow convertible and I am content."
"'(loodbve," lie cried, and ran away as fast as his chubby little
legs could carry him, for he had no convertible, nor (lie money to
buy one, nor the means to got the money, short of picking up his
stingy father by the ankles and shaking him till his wallet
fell out.
I le knew ho must forget this girl but, lying on his pallet at the
dormitory, whimpering and moaning, he knew he could not.
At last an idea came to him: though lie did not have the money
to buy a convertible, perhaps lie had enough to rent one!
Hope reborn, ho rushed at once to an automobile rental
company and rented a yellow convertible for s 10 down plus 10c
a mile, and with many a laugh and cheer drove away to pick
up the girl.

"Oil, goody," slio said when she saw the car. "This suits my
simple tastes to :i ''I". Come, let us speed over rolling highways
and through bosky dells."
And away they drove. All that day and night they drove and
finally, tired hut happy, they parked high on a windswept hill.
"Marlboro?" he said.
"Yum yum," she said.
They lit up. They puffed with deep contentment. "You
know," lie said, "you are like a Marlboro—mild and fresh
and relaxing."
"Hut there is a big difference between Marlboro find me," she
said, "because I do not have a Selectrate filter nor do I come
in soft pack or flip-top box."
They laughed. They kissed. Tfe screamed.
"What is it, mv dear," she cried, alarmed.
"Took at the speedometer," he said. "We have driven 200
miles and this car costs lOr a mile and I have only $20 left."
"Hut that's exactly enough," she said.
"Yes," he said, "but we still have to drive home."
They fell into a profound gloom, lie started the motor and
backed out of the parking place.
"I lev, look!" she said. "The speedometer doesn't move when
you're backing up."
Ile looked. It was true. "Kureka !" lie cried. "That solves my
problem. I will drive home in reverse. Then no more miles will
register on the speedometer and 1 will have enough money
to pay!"
"1 tlt ink that's a marvelous idea," she said, and she was right.
Because today our hero is in the county jail where food, clot lies
and lodging are provided free of charge and hi- allowance is
piling up so fast that he will have enough money to take hi- uirl
riding again as soon as he is released.

dormitory, whimpering and moaning, he knew he could not.
At last an idea came to him: though lie did not have the money
to buy a convertible, perhaps lie had enough to rent one!
Hope reborn, ho rushed at once to an automobile rental
company and rented a yellow convertible for s 10 down plus 10c
a mile, and with many a laugh and cheer drove away to pick
up the girl.

"Oil, goody," slio said when she saw the car. "This suits my
simple tastes to :i ''I". Come, let us speed over rolling highways
and through bosky dells."
And away they drove. All that day and night they drove and
finally, tired hut happy, they parked high on a windswept hill.
"Marlboro?" he said.
"Yum yum," she said.
They lit up. They puffed with deep contentment. "You
know," lie said, "you are like a Marlboro—mild and fresh
and relaxing."
"Hut there is a big difference between Marlboro find me," she
said, "because I do not have a Selectrate filter nor do I come
in soft pack or flip-top box."
They laughed. They kissed. Tfe screamed.
"What is it, mv dear," she cried, alarmed.
"Took at the speedometer," he said. "We have driven 200
miles and this car costs lOr a mile and I have only $20 left."
"Hut that's exactly enough," she said.
"Yes," he said, "but we still have to drive home."
They fell into a profound gloom, lie started the motor and
backed out of the parking place.
"I lev, look!" she said. "The speedometer doesn't move when
you're backing up."
Ile looked. It was true. "Kureka !" lie cried. "That solves my
problem. I will drive home in reverse. Then no more miles will
register on the speedometer and 1 will have enough money
to pay!"
"1 tlt ink that's a marvelous idea," she said, and she was right.
Because today our hero is in the county jail where food, clot lies
and lodging are provided free of charge and hi- allowance is
piling up so fast that he will have enough money to take hi- uirl
riding again as soon as he is released.

Tlioy mot. His heart leapt. "I love you," ho cried.
"Mo, too, hoy," she cried.
''Toll me," lie cried, '"are you a girl of expensive tastes?"
''No, liov," alio cried, ''1 am :i girl of simple tastes."
'•( lood," lie cried, "for my cruel father sends me an allowance
barely large enough to support life."
"Money does not matter to me, site cried. "My tastes are
simple, my wants are few. Just take me riding in a long, new,
yellow convertible and I am content."
"'(loodbve," lie cried, and ran away as fast as his chubby little
legs could carry him, for he had no convertible, nor (lie money to
buy one, nor the means to got the money, short of picking up his
stingy father by the ankles and shaking him till his wallet
fell out.
