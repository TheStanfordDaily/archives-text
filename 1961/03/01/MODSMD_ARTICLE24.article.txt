# Oz and Ends

### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
The End Is Near
Big Five basketball is nearing its final stages both Stanford
and Cal have three games left and Washington, UCLA and USC each
have four to play and then there's nothing left but the NCAA re
gional and nationals.
i:\< i:i'T FOK A FKW flashes of glory by Cal in pro-season and
some momentary threats from UCLA, the AAWU has been dominated
by the Southern California Trojans who are currently leading the
league with six wins and two losses and boast an overall record of
17-5. Their only losses have been to cross-town rival UCLA, the
Washington Huskies, lowa, Kansas State and, most recently, a 62-58
decision last weekend to Oregon State.
Barring the most improbable turn of events, the southland aces,
led by center John Rudometkin, will win the league championship

and a chance to compete in the
Far West playoffs in Portland,
March 17 and 18.
Only Washington and UCLA
have any more than the remotest
possibility of upending the top
ranked Trojans. At the moment
the Huskies are in second spot
with a six and four record and of
the northlanders' four remaining
frays, two are league affairs
they'll have to win both and hope
for USC tf> lose at least half of
their final counting games.
UCLA'S ( i:s are slim
mer. The Bruins are four and four
and need to win three more,
coupled with four SC losses to
sneak in the back door.
A much more undecided issue
than who will win the local cham
pionship is the question of who
will represent the West in the
NCAA finals.

Two of the Far West playoff berths will go to the champions of
the Skyline Fight Conference and the West Coast Conference. Lead
ing at the moment in the Skyline loop are the Utah Redskins, followed
closely by Colorado State, trailing by one game; Loyola is ahead
in West Coast play with St. Mary's a half a game behind and USF
one and a half back.
I)i:FKXI)I\<; skyi.lNF champion Utah is favored to win again
this year, but the WCAC leadership in the past month has changed
hands several times and it's still anybody's guess as to the eventual
outcome. St. Mary's dumped Loyola 91-62 in their last meeting and
could close the gap as they did last year, although Loyola has the
easier finishing schedule.
The other tournament berths will go to the victors of elimination
games to be played between the winner of the Bolder Conference
and an independent team, and the Big Five qualifier and another
independent school.
Arizona State or New Mexico State will he the Border repre
sentative and there will probably be a battle between Seattle. Portland
and OSC for the independent spots. Seattle has the best overall rec
ord at 17-7. but the Beavers from Oregon State have beaten both the
Chieftains and the Portland Pilots in early season.
â€¢sO Hi m: s Till: WAY the playoffs could shape up: Utah vs. St.
Mary's and USC vs. Seattle, OSC or Portland in the first round; Utah
vs. USC in the finals with the Trojans on top.
We won t go any further though. None of the Big Five teams
looks strong enough to handle Ohio State or some of the other East
ern and Midwestern teams to duplicate Cal's national championship
and runnerup finishes in '59 and '60.
Some Traditional Tinsel
As long as we're wrapping up coast basketball, we might as well
add some of the traditional tinsel and forward a few nominations
for an All-Coast team.
At guard the standout in the area has been Frank Burgess, the
dearieye lrom Gonzaga w ho has the top scoring average in the nation,
hitting 32.6 points per game.
I in: Wi;sT is i.o with top centers, the most notable being
Rudometkin and Bill McGill of Utah. Both get the nod for All-Coast
honors, Rudomet kin because he has completely dominated Big Five
scoring while turning in exceptional performances in almost all
other categories, and the 6-9 McGill on the strength of his 20-point
per game scoring and top rebounding to lead the Utes to a 19-5 mark.
Another natural choice for the top quintet is Tom Mesehery, the
rugged senior forward for the St. Mary's Gaels. Although heralded
a- an All-American in pro-season, Tom started slowly but has .since
begun to live up to his press in recent games, helping knock USF
out of the WCAC lead with 20 points and 19 rebounds against the
Dons last Saturday.
I he other starter is much harder to pick. Some of the good re
maining hoopers are Bill Hanson of Washington. Cal's Bill Me-
Clintoek. Oregon's Charlie Warren and .John Berborich of UCLA and
Chris Appel from SC. Seattle has a couple of hotshots in Dave Mills,
and, lost we pass up one of the Cards, John Windsor is certainly on
a par with the rest. The Stanford star is hitting around I I counters
per fray and put 30 through the not against UCLA.
WIIO (ii:T'S Til 10 nod? Wo can't decide they all have looked
good. We'll pass the buck to the readers you pick one.


JOHN WINDSOR
All-Coast?
