## 
### 
WASHINGTON <UPI> Tho
tax collector threw a half-million
dollar punch at Ingemar Johans
; son today.
The government charged that
tho Swedish lighter owes tho
United States $.198,181 in back
taxes. To recoup, the Justice De
partment asked tho federal courts
1 to freeze recipts from his March
13 bout with heavyweight cham
pion Floyd Patterson.
Johansson claims that actually
ho is a resident of Switzerland
and doesn't have to pay U.S.
taxes.
Tho government contends the
taxes are due on receipts from Jo
hansson's 1959 and 19(50 bouts
with Patterson and on funds from
television and other appearances
in this country. Johannson
knocked <>ut Patterson for the
heavyweight title in 1959 and gut
knocked out in turn last year.
SO Till; government turned to
the rubber match in Miami to got
the taxes it says are duo it. The
federal district courts in both
Miami and New York were asked
to freeze Johansson's funds from
tho fight.
The action was taken after In
ternal Hovenue Service (TPSt
agents served Johansson with a
demand for the hack taxes at his
West Palm Beach. Fla., training
camp. The suit climaxed a long
dispute between tho fighter and
tho tax collector.
