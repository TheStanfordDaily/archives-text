# Dedication Today For New Stauffer Chemical Building
## Sterling's Talk To Open 3-Day Symposium 
### 
Dedication ceremonies will bo
held at noon today for Stanford's
new $800,000 John Stauffer Chem
islry Building.
The ceremonies will be attended
by officials of the Stauffer Chem
ical Co., after whose founder the
new building was named, and his
son John Stauffer, a principal
donor. Also present will be 13 dis
tinguished chemists who will con
duct a three-day symposium
through Friday, in conjunction
with the dedication.
The new building is presently
devoted to pure research into na
tural products. No classrooms are
included in the new building; it
is primarily a laboratory designed
for graduate students and for re
search. Nevertheless. Dr. William
S. Johnson, executive head of the
Chemistry Department, thinks
that the new research building is
also important to undergraduate
education in chemistry:
"ANY UNIVERSITY having
such a graduate education pro
gram has advantages for under
graduates. This year, Stanford
seniors taking the honors pro
gram in chemistry can do re
search in natural products. In a
few years, we hope that all chem
istry majors may participate in
this program of graduate re
search."
Dr. Carl Djerassi. Stanford
chemistry professor and symposi
um chairman, said "We decided
that an international symposium
on natural products would be de
sirable and particularly appropri
ate since the Stauffer Building is
facilitating Stanford's research
into natural products."
IN AN ADDRESS scheduled for
0 a.m., President Wallace Sterling
will inaugurate the International
Chemistry Symposium.
Each of the chemists will give
an address on the chemistry of
natural products, to an audience
limited to 200 graduate scholars
and scientists.
The 13 speakers include chem
ists from the University of Paris,
the USSR Academy of Sciences,
Cambridge University, Oxford
University, the University of
Tokyo, Columbia, Harvard, and
Illinois.
Among the speakers will be Sir
Alexander Todd of Cambridge
University, who won the Nobel
Prize in 19i57 for research into
nucleotides and nucleic acids.
