# 'Water, Water Everywhere'--Except Lag
## 
### 
Pity the pour freshmen! The
rains have not come and Lake
Lagunita will not be opened this
spring unless a deluge of rains
hits the campus in the next couple
of months.
Not only might Lake Lag not
he filled, but the University will
faee a serious water shortage if
it does not rain. The wells that
furnish the University's domestic
water supply depend on the rain
and, to a certain extent, on Lake
Lag.
IF THE wells go dry, Stanford
will be forced to convert its do
mestic water supply to irrigation
usage and buy water from San
Francisco.
Lake Lag, holding 115 million
gallons of water, is filled by the
overflow coming down San Fran
cisquito Creek from Searsville
Lake and Felt Lake. At the pres
ent time, these lakes are as low
as they can be. Stanford Fire
Chief John Marston said that if

it doesn't rain, Stanford may have
to ration water.
Since July 1, 1960, the Bay
Area has had 9 1 - inches of rain.
This is about 4 inches less than
I t ho average rainfall from July to
March.
Without Lake Lag, spring quar
ter will not he the same. Students
will not be able to go swimming,
or canoeing, and the freshmen will
not learn how damaging to studies
Lake Lag can be.
AS THE campus social center
during spring quarter, Lake Lag
usually provides students with op
portunities for exchanges. No
Lake Lag means no swimming for
students who do not have trans
portation to the beaches.
The boathouse at the lake has
undergone extensive painting and
cleaning done for the most part
; by fraternities in expectation of
i a good swimming and boating
! season. LASSU appropriated $1,-
500 in addition to the annual main

| tenance funds for painting and
carpentry work at the boathouse.
Students employed as life-guards
during spring quarter will be out
of work, although they will still
live in the boathouse.
NO LAKE Lag will disrupt the
Hydrofollies planned as a part of
Con Home Week. Scheduled to
kick off the Con Home Week ac
tivities during the first week in
May, the Hydrofollies tradition
ally features water skiing exhibi
tions, water jousting, and boat
races between faculty members
and students.
Lake Lag has never been closed
for the entire year. Often, how
ever, the lake is only open until
May.
If Lake Lag is not filled this
year, it will take even more water
to fill it next year. Whether the
i lake is open in future years will
! depend on the amount of rain dur-
I ing the particular year.

STANFORD BOATHOUSE SITS FORLORNLY OVER BURNING SANDS OF LAKE I.ACUNITA
For the first time since Lag was opened, it will not be available to pleasure seekers spring quarter
Pity the pour freshmen! The
rains have not come and Lake
Lagunita will not be opened this
spring unless a deluge of rains
hits the campus in the next couple
of months.
Not only might Lake Lag not
he filled, but the University will
faee a serious water shortage if
it does not rain. The wells that
furnish the University's domestic
water supply depend on the rain
and, to a certain extent, on Lake
Lag.
IF THE wells go dry, Stanford
will be forced to convert its do
mestic water supply to irrigation
usage and buy water from San
Francisco.
Lake Lag, holding 115 million
gallons of water, is filled by the
overflow coming down San Fran
cisquito Creek from Searsville
Lake and Felt Lake. At the pres
ent time, these lakes are as low
as they can be. Stanford Fire
Chief John Marston said that if

it doesn't rain, Stanford may have
to ration water.
Since July 1, 1960, the Bay
Area has had 9 1 - inches of rain.
This is about 4 inches less than
I t ho average rainfall from July to
March.
Without Lake Lag, spring quar
ter will not he the same. Students
will not be able to go swimming,
or canoeing, and the freshmen will
not learn how damaging to studies
Lake Lag can be.
AS THE campus social center
during spring quarter, Lake Lag
usually provides students with op
portunities for exchanges. No
Lake Lag means no swimming for
students who do not have trans
portation to the beaches.
The boathouse at the lake has
undergone extensive painting and
cleaning done for the most part
; by fraternities in expectation of
i a good swimming and boating
! season. LASSU appropriated $1,-
500 in addition to the annual main

| tenance funds for painting and
carpentry work at the boathouse.
Students employed as life-guards
during spring quarter will be out
of work, although they will still
live in the boathouse.
NO LAKE Lag will disrupt the
Hydrofollies planned as a part of
Con Home Week. Scheduled to
kick off the Con Home Week ac
tivities during the first week in
May, the Hydrofollies tradition
ally features water skiing exhibi
tions, water jousting, and boat
races between faculty members
and students.
Lake Lag has never been closed
for the entire year. Often, how
ever, the lake is only open until
May.
If Lake Lag is not filled this
year, it will take even more water
to fill it next year. Whether the
i lake is open in future years will
! depend on the amount of rain dur-
I ing the particular year.
