### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) - Presi
dent Kennedy yesterday ordered
establishment of a pilot model
"Peace Corps" of trained Ameri
can volunteers to be sent abroad
to aid underdeveloped nations.
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D
; Minn., called Kennedy's request
j " a dream come true" and said he
j would introduce a bill to carry out
j the request.
"Life in the Peace Corps will
i not be easy," Kennedy warned,
i "Men and women will be expected
i to work and live alongside the na
tionals of the country in which
: they ai'e stationed â€”doing the
! same work, eating the same food.
| talking the same language."
Peace Corps members will not
| be exempt from the military draft.
However, the deferment which
| will be in effect during the two
or three years they will serve
overseas may carry them beyond
the normal peacetime draft age.
