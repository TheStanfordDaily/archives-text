# Health Facilities Only Half-solved
## 
### 
The meeting of the Palo Alto City Council Tuesday night along
with the mass illness at Durand House have shown that the Health
Service problem is only half-solved.
In the instance of the Durand illness which fell sixteen girls
on Monday afternoon, the Health Service cleared itself of the cloud
which hung over its operations for its share of the Encina food
poisoning incident. In this case Dr. George Houck, Director of the
Health Service, and Dr. Maurice Osborne along with Health Officer
Hal Wilson responded to the call for help immediately. The steps
which the Health Service took in the wake of the past two poison
ing issues have proved effective.
However, the disclosures by the Stanford-Palo Alto Hospital
Board Member Gordon Smith before the Palo Alto City Council
show that dangers still exist in the University's health facilities. Mr.
Smith told the Council that the hospital is handling a near-capacity
number of patients and that some physicians believe a "medical
emergency" exists. He warned that "The situation is only going
to get worse." Such news is not new. Only last week Stanford
Health Service doctors complained that they had been forced to
treat serious illnesses such as pneumonia in University dormitories
or Rest Homes because they simply could not obtain beds for
students in the hospital.
This situation is now being investigated by a special committee
of Legislature, chaired by the capable Ward McDonald. We know
that Mr. McDonald will not be waylayed by the assertions of some
that no problem exists. We hope he will not be discouraged by
the apathy of some Legislature members over this problem which
vitally concerns their constituents.
Rather this committee should bring to the attention of the Legis
lature and the Administration the inadequacies of health facilities
at Stanford.
