## On Obsolescence 
### 
Unfortunately, planned obso
lescence is necessary; our free
enterprise system depends upon
it.
Years ago we had open compe
tition in industry. Auto manufac
turers fought one another until
only a few survived. Competition
to "build a better car" was stiff.
Then, in 1931, the Ford Motor
Company ended the production of
its highly successful Model "A."
These sturdy cars — many of
which still operate today — were
inexpensive to maintain and run.
They were a strong competitor in
the car market.
There were two reasons for the
discontinuation. First, the sale of
cars which last 30 years soon ex
hausts the number of future buy
ers. No one needs a new car if
his old one runs well. (He may
want one, but it isn't a necessity.)
Second, if a car is so well made
that it floods the market and
forces competitors out of busi
ness, there soon emerges one
strong monopolistic company.
We have some monopolies now:
the telephone and gas companies,
for instance. But, generally, the
formation of government con
trolled monopolies is unacceptable
to the "American Mind." Since
this course was not available the
car companies decided to stop
competition. They began to set a
level of prices and standards
which advanced at a regular rate.
They set standards of obso
lescence. The question was no
no longer the old "How can we
build a better car?" There was
a new question: "How long should
this car serve its owner?"
Letters to the Daily have cen
tered on the moral issue surround
ing the latter question. Unfortu
nately, too few people have
thought about the larger question
of "competition vs. cooperation."
Only cooperation between "com
petitors" allows planned obso
lescence to exist. Yet if you throw
manufacturers into dog-eat-dog
competition, one will come out on
top. Which should kill competi
tion: government-regulated mon
opoly, or corporate cooperation?
During World War 11. auto pro
duction stopped. We had to make
do with the Model "A" and other
pre-war cars. If we were involved
in an emergency today, how long
would our present cars last? How
long would the remaining bulk of
our "durable goods" last? Our
material security is based on con
tinued production. What, would
we do if it stopped for four years?
