# Africans Constructive
## 
### 
For the sake of Mr. Lame Loehr
let me point out the African stu
dents have engaged in a thousand
and one constructive activities in
and around the campus and in the
San Francisco Bay Area. Such
activities have included:
1) Constructive and I think,
useful work with the African
Desk of the lIR.
2) Talks in eating clubs, I-Cen
ter. and other campus organiza
tions reporting the ways in which
all of us might cooperate to help
the African emerging nations.
3) Talks and discussions to
local churches, Kiwanis, and Ro
tary Clubs.
4) Panel discussions on some of
the issues that face Africa.
5) TV and radio commentaries
â€”on the ways in which we think
African-American relations can be
improved.
6) And, of course, carried out
academic load just like Mr. Loehr
or any other Stanford student.
I think the trouble with Mr.
Loehr lies in the fact that when
he "woke up" from his books, he
heard of the pickets and the Con-
Standard not only as a valid ideal
but also as a practical way of life.
We have discussed such questions
as what the Fundamental Stand
aid is meant to be, whether it con
flicts with the individual's person
al values, and whether its indi
vidual nature destroys its applica
bility to the group.
VVe feel that the Fundamental
Standard can be effective if the
individual considers it as a work
ing system dependent upon a co
operative responsibility between
him and his society.
An open discussion will be held
in the Trancos Lounge at 7 o'clock
today. All are invited to attend.

golese crisis and therefore hastily
assumed that that was all the
African students can do. There is
no doubt that for anybody who
has bothered 1o find out or who
has any interest at all, the Afri
can students have carried more
than their share in putting for
ward constructive ideas and sug
gestions. It is apparent that we
still have a long way 1o go to get
to Mr. Loehr. But to got to him
and to many other Stanford stu
dents like him, we too must come
half Ihe way. To sit in his book
smelling room for 24 hours does
not help anyone but himself.
