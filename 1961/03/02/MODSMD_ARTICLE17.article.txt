## Arab Nationalism Muted in Saudi Arabi

Last Doc. 21, Radio Mocca an
nounced that King Sand of Saudi
Arabia had taken over effective
political control of ihe country
from his brother. Crown Prince
Faisal. The King's action appar
ently ended a political struggle
with his brother that was carried
on, overtly or covertly, since Saud
succeeded his father, King Ibn
Saud in November, 1953.
Ibn Saud was a benevolent au
thoritarian who consolidated and
ruled Saudi Arabia within Ihe
spirit of traditional Islamic law.
A paladin of great physical and
moral stature, he was both shrewd
and intelligent. Yet events a
month before his death suggested
the Westernization of Saudi Ara
bia had progressed beyond affect
ing a narrow elite for in October
the first organized action of Saudi
Arabian workers occurred in a
strike among the Saudi oil work
ers.
THE GROWING change in
Saudi Arabian society, primarily
a result of oil industrialization,
suggested than that Ihe tradi
tional benevolent authoritarian
ism could not indefinitely con
tinue. Yet sinre 1953 Saud not
only attempted to perpetuate this
traditionalism; he has ruled in the
old way with much less ability
than his father. His traditional
ism has been accompanied by ex
travagent royal spending that re
peatedly has plunged the country
into an economic crisis, in spite of
yearly oil revenue alone of .$3OO
million.
Merely to keep the state ma
chinery operating and the coun
try solvent. Saud had 1o rely heav
ily on the considerable ability of
his brother Faisal, Foreign Minis
ter under Ibn Saud and holder of
this and many other government
offices under King Saud. Faisal
worked for healthy progressive
change in Saudi Arabia, particu
larly administrative and fiscal re
form. He encouraged increased
efficiency in government and
sought to reduce the corruption
and royal spending that have seri
ously limited Saudi Arabia's eco
nomic development programs.
The latest serious economic
crisis developed in 1957, and Fai
sal then made his continued par
ticipation in the government de
pendent on being granted in
creased political power. In March,
1958, King Saud appointed him
premier, as well as foreign, de
fense, and financial minister. Fai
sal set out on a program of re
newed administrative and fiscal
l-eform and economic austerity
that became increasingly onerous
to King Saud, particularly because

i of the limitations Faisal imposed
j on royal spending. The import of
{Cadillacs, for example, was pro
; hibited. Yet Sand did not chal
lenge Faisal's authority, appar
ently in ihe fear that his resigna
tion would percipitate government
collapse and serious opposition to
| the King himself.
BY THE summer of 19fi0, Saud
| apparently decided that Faisal's
authority need be tolerated no
i longed. The Crown Prince's fail
! ing health may have been a factor.
I In any case King Saud paid nu
merous visits to the Pastoral Be
douin chieftains who remain, in
| the absence of a real military
elite, the ultimate source of po
litical power in Saudi Arabia. The
King offered constitutional re
forms in exchange for renewed
I support from tribal leaders. Con
solidating this support by Decem
; bcr, King Saud dismissed Faisal.
The King's resumption of politi-
I cal power is likely to have harm
| ful consequences for both Saudi
| Arabia's internal development and
iU.S. interests in the Middle East.
{Having ousted Faisal, King Saud
] is not likely to again allow a chal
lenge to his personal rule.
Yet Arab nationalism and politi-
I cal act ion for economic advance
| ment have as yet been muted in
• isolated and independent Saudi
Arabia. The disruptive effects of
these 20th-century phenomena are
certain 10 increase in Saudi Ara
| bia, particularly as a result of the
! continued expansion of the oil in
dustry. The question remains
j whether this change will be grad
ual or sudden, evolutionary or
i revolutionary. If Sand's author
itarian government attempts to
' perpetuate itself too long, as may
J well happen after the events of
, last December, the change is like
-1 ly to be severe, and directed not
I only against the Saudi dynasty
; but against the Western govern

Last Doc. 21, Radio Mocca an
nounced that King Sand of Saudi
Arabia had taken over effective
political control of ihe country
from his brother. Crown Prince
Faisal. The King's action appar
ently ended a political struggle
with his brother that was carried
on, overtly or covertly, since Saud
succeeded his father, King Ibn
Saud in November, 1953.
Ibn Saud was a benevolent au
thoritarian who consolidated and
ruled Saudi Arabia within Ihe
spirit of traditional Islamic law.
A paladin of great physical and
moral stature, he was both shrewd
and intelligent. Yet events a
month before his death suggested
the Westernization of Saudi Ara
bia had progressed beyond affect
ing a narrow elite for in October
the first organized action of Saudi
Arabian workers occurred in a
strike among the Saudi oil work
ers.
THE GROWING change in
Saudi Arabian society, primarily
a result of oil industrialization,
suggested than that Ihe tradi
tional benevolent authoritarian
ism could not indefinitely con
tinue. Yet sinre 1953 Saud not
only attempted to perpetuate this
traditionalism; he has ruled in the
old way with much less ability
than his father. His traditional
ism has been accompanied by ex
travagent royal spending that re
peatedly has plunged the country
into an economic crisis, in spite of
yearly oil revenue alone of .$3OO
million.
Merely to keep the state ma
chinery operating and the coun
try solvent. Saud had 1o rely heav
ily on the considerable ability of
his brother Faisal, Foreign Minis
ter under Ibn Saud and holder of
this and many other government
offices under King Saud. Faisal
worked for healthy progressive
change in Saudi Arabia, particu
larly administrative and fiscal re
form. He encouraged increased
efficiency in government and
sought to reduce the corruption
and royal spending that have seri
ously limited Saudi Arabia's eco
nomic development programs.
The latest serious economic
crisis developed in 1957, and Fai
sal then made his continued par
ticipation in the government de
pendent on being granted in
creased political power. In March,
1958, King Saud appointed him
premier, as well as foreign, de
fense, and financial minister. Fai
sal set out on a program of re
newed administrative and fiscal
l-eform and economic austerity
that became increasingly onerous
to King Saud, particularly because

i of the limitations Faisal imposed
j on royal spending. The import of
{Cadillacs, for example, was pro
; hibited. Yet Sand did not chal

ently in ihe fear that his resigna
