## Reporter Has Big News for The Old Boy': Stanford Women Do Have 'It'—She Says 
### 
"What . . . San Jose women
have
• That the bookstore doesn't
sell?
• That Stanford men want?
• That Stanford women don't
even know about?
FINI) OUT March 3! The
Blast . . ."
With these words the February
issue of Chaparral (Stanford's
sometime humor magazine)
launched a last-ditch campaign 1o
lift its sagging reputation. Reel
ing under a wave of criticism ex
pressed in letters to the Daily, the

Chappie slyly di
rected its cam
paign at the larg
est majo r i t y
group at Stan
ford -men—on
the subject of the
most basic inter
est — sex.
This is not to
say that sex is a
unique topic for
Chappie, as any

regular reader knows. Chappie
has taken to its heart that wise
old saw, "When all else fails, try
sex."
All else frequently fails.
Chappie frequently tries sex.
Occasionally Ihe Dean must
take action.
NO, CHAPPIE—Iike any per
ceptive commercial enterprise —
has never failed to realize that
the way to a man's wallet is
through his desires. But in the
latest issue, it achieves a new
height in blatancy. Abandoning
all pretense of subtlety, Chappie

offers its hungry male readers a
raft of "warm pulsating women"
at an event whose purpose is to
stimulate "social intercourse."
Dismissing Stanford as a
"parched pile of sandstone," the
Old Boy pictures the neighboring i
college as a virtual Garden of
Eden, with an alluring San Jose
lovely under every tree, coquet
ishly dangling the forbidden fruit
at the advancing Farm boys.
We have a strong idea as to
what it is that the San oJse j
women have, or at least what the
Stanford men who are buying j
tickets to the Blast hope they
have: true, the bookstore doesn't |
sell it; true. Stanford men appear [
to want it. But we have news for
the Olrl Boy. Stanford women
have known about it for a long ;
time. Maybe that's why they're so !
wary of Stanford men.
THERE SEEM 1o be some
rumblings of social discontent on
this campus. Chaparral has risen
to the cause in the name of justice 1

—or something. Chaparral tells
us that Stanford women aren't
"outgoing" enough, leaving the
definition of ihat word up to iho
reader's imagination; Chaparral
tolls us that Stanford women are
frightened by drunken men and
ignored by sober ones; Chaparral
is having a ball.
The Daily, unlike its dubious
journalistic colleague, is inter
ested in objective, enlightened an
alysis. Therefore, in line with
other recent articles on university
institutions, this writer is launch
ing a series entitled, "The Stan
ford Woman: Myth or Reality?"
These articles, appearing now
and then will explore the language
and customs of Stanford women;
it will reveal the attitudes and pre
conceived prejudices of Stanford
men. even attempting to draw the
Old Boy out of hiding for an in
terview; and it will endeavor to
shed some light on the mysterious
driving force in Stanford activi
ties which is known as The Ratio.
