# Car Traffic Cut in Half On Lomita
## 
### 
Progress snapped up another
small but familiar hit of Stanford
life yesterday with the announce
ment that auto traffic no longer
will flow on hoth sides of the
huge live oak tree across from the
Physics Lecture Hall.
The part of Lomita Drive next
to the building has been closed
for good, Stanford Police Chief
Gordon Davis said, to make way
for the start of construction on
the new Russell H. Varian Lab
oratory of Physics.
AS A RESULT, the part of Lo
mita next to Quad across from the
hall has been converted to two
way traffic, and the diagonal
parking has been switched to
parallel parking.
Lomita will remain open to ve
hicle traffic the rest of this
school year, Davis said, but may
be closed forever during summer.
He said the partial closing was
the first step toward eventually
blocking all traffic from Panama
Street (where the Press and Daily
Shack are) down past Geology
Corner to Scrra Street at Physics
Corner.
The move caused the elimina
tion of J2 or 13 parking spaces,
the chief said. lie noted the spaces
loft will remain reserved.
DAVIS said he did not expect
any serious trouble from the clos
ing.
The area involved eventually
will become a mall area between
Quad and the new Physics build
ing.
Campus Drive which starts at
Palm Drive and runs past Encina
Gym, behind the eating clubs,
Wilbur, Stern and in front of
Moore until it ends at Lake Lagu
nita will be extended to go be
hind the Science Quad area where
the physics buildings are. It will
become the main campus traffic
artery within the next few years.
Campus already skirts three
fourths of the educational part of
the campus.
