# THIS YOUNG ENGINEER IS ON THE ROAD TO MANAGEMENT
## 
### 
Dick Cotton know he wanted to take the
engineering route into management long before
he joined New Jersey Bell Telephone Company.
In fact it was his goal when he was working for
his engineering degree at Rutgers.
When he graduated, he had his lines out to
eleven other companies. He came to New Jersey
Bell because: "I didn't feel I was just a number
to these people. There was no doubt in my mind
that this job would be the best for the long pull."
His first assignment was a tough one. A com
plex of major telephone cables lay in the path of
the approach to the new traffic level of the George
Washington Bridge on the Hudson. Dick's job
was to find the most practical and economical
way to reroute these cables, and at the same time
to provide for future telephone growth in the
area around the bridge approach.
Dick ironed that one out and got a crack at
another tough job.

"Our number one aim is to have in all
management johs the most vital, intelli
gent, positive and imaginative men ire
can possibly find."
Frederick R. Kappei., President
American Telephone «6 Telenrnph Co.

Dick was a member of a four-man team whose
job was to find ways to eliminate some of the
routine work of field engineers to give them
"more time to think." Dick also helped plan
and control a $100,000,000 annual telephone con
struction budget.
Presently, Dick is responsible for telephone
equipment engineering projects in the Camden,
New Jersey, area.
How does Dick look at it? "This is a growing
business. I work with this growth every day.
And growth means more room at the top. Of
course, I don't figure I'll get there overnight —
but on my jobs so far I've had a chance to take
a good look at how this business is run. And I
think the sky's the limit for a man who really
wants to work for it."
