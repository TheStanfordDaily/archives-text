Towards the end of a basketball game Ihe captain called time out.
"Look fellows," he said, "We're not doing any good this way. Let's
start playing like we always do. You guys are making me self-con
scious."
But the rest of the team wouldn't listen and when time was back
in they started playing the same way .Every time they got the ball
it went to the captain and when lie passed off he got it right back
again. So ho did the shooting.
When the game was over Stanford had beaten a highly regarded
Duquesne team by the unheard of score of 92-27. The captain, a
young Italian from San Francisco named Angelo "Hank" Luisetti,
who many think is the best basketball player ever to play ihe

game, had scored ."><) points.
That was New Year's Day. 1938,
in Cleveland. It was the second
time that Luisetti had gone on an
eastern trip with Stanford's bas
ketball team. By then ho had a
reputation, even in the East, and
when Stanford came to town you
went to sec Luisetti and the shot
that revolutionized basketball.
It had been a little different a
year earlier. Western teams didn't
usually do well on eastern trips.
The California school that sent
its basketball team out to play
ihe eastern or mid-western lions
seldom won many of the six or
seven games it played on the tour.
A little interest had been built
up by the game between Stanford
and Long Island University in
Madison Square Garden in 1937.
Long Island had won 13 straight
cames and some of l ho K;istpi nnr«

had heard about Luisetti and his strange new shot, the one-handcr



HANK LUISETTI
Greatest of them all
