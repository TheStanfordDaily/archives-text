# It'll Never Last

The Indians won that night, but there were some doubts about
the one-handed shot. "Lucky," and "It'll never last," were the most
frequent comments, but everywhere Stanford went on the tour Lui
setti pinned back the ears of the opposition with his new shot.
"I worked on it a little in high school," Luisetti says, "but I
really didn't use it a lot until "ollege. They guarded a lot closer in
college ball and I resorted to the one hand shot to get it away faster."
Luisetti lerl Stanford to three straight Pacific Coast Conference
titles and, though there were no national championship tournaments,
many observers felt that the Tribe was the best in the country, as
season records of 22-7 in 1936, 25-2 in 1937 and 21-3 in 193K were
rolled up.
The first NCAA basketball tournament was held in 1939, a year
after Luisetti had graduated, and the winner was Oregon. Stanford
had beaten the same team the year before.
The one big letdown of Luisetti's career concerned the 1936 Olym
pics. The Olympic team was picked differently then, with a series
of playoffs and the winning team getting the trip to Berlin. The
Indians won the Southern Division title and then beat Washington,
the Northern Division champs, and thought that they had won their
right to meet the winners from the other areas of the country.
But the Western officials needed more money to send their repre
sentative East and a game with Oregon was arranged. Oregon won.
"There's no excuse for our losing," Luisetti says, "but we were
psychologically down after the Washington game. We made a lot
of mistakes against Oregon. They've got the system to pick players
for the Olympics down better now. By taking the top collegiate,
AAU and service players they get a better team with less confusion."
