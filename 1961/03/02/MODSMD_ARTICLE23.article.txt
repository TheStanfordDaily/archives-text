# Everybody Shoots
## 
### 
Luisetti never played professional basketball because of an illness
contracted while in Ihe Navy. What he might have done in Ihe day
of the 24-second rule and the discrimination against the defensive
man surpasses the imagination.
"The game has changed a lot," says the man who changed it.
"They're really shot-conscious now. Years ago you'd have one or
two good shooters on a team and you'd practice defense a lot. Now
everybody has to ho able to shoot. Defense just isn't as glamorous.
The kids are better shooters on the whole."
One of the last of Luisetti's records was broken Saturday in the
Pavilion when freshman Tom Dose cracked his Stanford mark for
total points scored by a frosh. Dose had a season total of 313 to
Luisetti's 305. If it means anything Dose had an extra game to
do it 'in.
Luisetti sent Dose a letter last year urging him 1o consider Stan
ford. Surveying the ruins of his record, Luisetti said emphatically,
"Rerords are made to be broken."
