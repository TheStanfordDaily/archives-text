### NILS WESSELL 
President. Wallace Sterling and
John Stauffer yesterday dedi
cated Stanford's new John Stauf
fer Chemistry Building honoring
the memory of Katherina Stauf
fer and John Stauffer Sr.
A granddaughter and son of
John Stauffer Sr. provided finan
cial backing to build the labora
tory at a cost of $800,000. "That
they have seen fit to re-invest in
education," Sterling said, "repre
sents citizenship of the very high
est order."
OFFICIALS of tin* Stauffer
Chemical Co., which John Stauf
fer Sr. founded, were also present
when Sterling with Stauffer's
help unveiled the commemorative
plaque.
During his address Sterling ob
served that when Stanford gradu
ated its first class in 189.1, Stauf
fer began a vigorous reorganiza
tion of his company.
Stauffer in his address hoped
that "Stanford would regain and
retain leadership in chemistry
With this building as a valuable
asset."
LAKLIICK in the day Sterling
welcomed the 13 participants and
200 registrants of the interna
tional chemistry symposium con
vened to celebrate the building's
dedication.
He delved into the history of
chemistry at Stanford saying that
"Chemistry has,had eras of great
ness hero and this symposium ini
tiates another."
The presence of such an illus
trious, international audience, he
said, demonstrated that "science
transcends politics." In the audi
ence was Dr. M. M. Shemyakin of
the USSR Academy of Sciences.
SIK ALEXANDER Todd of
Cambridge University is one of
the symposiasts. In 1957 he won
a Nobel Prize.
Sir Alexander told a press con
ference that "it is particularly im
portant that Stanford has this
new laboratory for research into
natural products since Dr. Arthur
Kornberg and Dr. Joshua Lcder
berg, both Nobel Prize winners,
are doing research in related
fields."
Today, chemists from Tokyo,
London, Moscow, and Stockholm
will speak; tomorrow, five more
chemists will conclude the confer
ence with their remarks.
