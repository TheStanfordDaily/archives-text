# BACHELOR WEEK
## Manhunt Nears Climax With Full Moon, Dance 
### 
As the rays of the full moon strike Quad tonight, Stanford women
will be making their dates "Stanford men."
Usually the men take the girls out to the Quad to make them
"Stanford women," but during Bachelor Week traditional roles are
reversed.
This annual manhunt will be climaxed Saturday night with a

Sadie Hawkins Dance.
Before strolling out under the
moon, girls will be able to take
their fellows to the Cellar, where
entertainment will be provided
from 10 to 11:30 p.m.
Women have been treating t lie
men all week in a variety of ways.
Many living groups cooked Sun
day brunch on "huge stoves" for
appreciative fraternities and had
dinner exchanges. Serenades also
have been a popular event, and
vocali/ing Branner girls were
water-bombed for their efforts.
Last night Roble girls consented
to serenade Arroyo and Cedro
freshmen, after rides were pro
vided and assurances were given
that there would be no water
bombing.
A large-scale tug-of-war staged
between Branner and Hinconada
Sunday ended in a mud fight and
defeat for the girls, who now have
to pay a forfeit, which has yet to
be disclosed.
"It's a good idea, but expensive,"
•said co-chairman Linda Andorsen,
giving a typical female opinion of
Bachelor Week. The amount of
money a boy spends on a date can
be shocking, she added,
