® BRAND Jf
support
C'mon, Dick! You're rationaliz
ing. Jockey support 1 might never
have secured you against the
Emperor". But it certainly would
have provided snug protection
against the physical stresses and
strains of your active life. Your
armorer never tailored a coat of
mail more knowingly than Jockey
tailors a brief — from 13 separate,
body-conforming pieces.
1. Other "imitation" briefs- (copies of the
original Jockey brand) hare no more
Jocliey support than a limp loin cloth.
2. Richard the Lion-Hearted, 1157-99,
surrendered England and a huge ransom
to secure liis release jrom Henry VI.
Get the real thing. Look for
the name JOCkeif on the waist band
