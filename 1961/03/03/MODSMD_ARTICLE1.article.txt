## ‘Tried’ in Congo, Belgian Declares 
### ILENE STRELITZ 
"We tried to create a Belgium
in Central Africa. One can take
this as a positive good or the
great sin of superiority; we did
it in the spirit of friendship." So
the San Francisco Belgian Consul
Marcel Rijmenans analyzed his
country's policy in a campus de
bate in Toyon Lounge last night.
Rijmenans faced Stanford Afri
can student Michael Ero iji a pro
gram entitled "Congo Crisis" mod
erated by Assistant Dean of Men
David Larimer and sponsored by
El Cuadro Club.
The evening's contentions re
volved around the question of the
amount of progress achieved in
the Congo under the fifty years
of Belgian direction. Rijmenans
pursued his stand by stating the
Belgians were being evaluated on
the basis of something they hadn't
had a chance to complete: they
hadn't expected independence to
come so quickly- "It takes more
than fifty years to impart great
spirit and traditions to a people."
AFRICAN-BORN Ero expressed
the feelings of the rebellious Afri
can provinces, "One culture can
not be forced upon another; one
people cannot force another to
think their way. Every imperial
ist culture has made the mistake
of trying to force a culture upon
a society; you cannot move a so
ciety from one part of the world
to another."
Ero did not view the primary
motive of the Belgians as this cul
ture exchange, though. "When
the whites first came they found
just tribes, no nation. They ex
ploited Africa and took her peo
ple."
"Belgium is staying in the Con
go abusing our sovereignty, show
ing her militarism. There is some
thing fishy about the professed
motive of stationing troops to
protect Belgian women and chil
dren when the troops are put in
tliose places in which there was
no revolt. The economic resources
of the Congo were all the Belgians
wanted."
RIJMENANS countered with
the citing of the construction of
two universities in the Congo in
1956. "Why would we build uni
versities if we weren't interested
in the people?" Ero answered
stating the universities were mere
"window polishing"; they were
not adequately equipped to serve
more than a few. and these few
were the elite they wanted to take
out of circulation and train for
menial positions.
The San Francisco diplomat
then referred to the high degree
of medical aid that has been intro
duced into the Congo, as well as a
school attendance that rates sec
ond only to Ghana in all of Africa.
He countered charges of exploi
tation by declaring that only four
per cent of Belgium's national in
come came from the Congo.
"We don't see the Congolese
situation as an economic loss,"
concluded the Belgian, "but the
loss of great friends whom we
held in esteem. We were trying
to impart to them that which we
had achieved."

motive of stationing troops to
protect Belgian women and chil
dren when the troops are put in
tliose places in which there was
no revolt. The economic resources
of the Congo were all the Belgians
wanted."
RIJMENANS countered with
the citing of the construction of
two universities in the Congo in
1956. "Why would we build uni
versities if we weren't interested
in the people?" Ero answered
stating the universities were mere
"window polishing"; they were
not adequately equipped to serve
more than a few. and these few
were the elite they wanted to take
out of circulation and train for
menial positions.
The San Francisco diplomat
then referred to the high degree
of medical aid that has been intro
duced into the Congo, as well as a
school attendance that rates sec
ond only to Ghana in all of Africa.
He countered charges of exploi
tation by declaring that only four
per cent of Belgium's national in
come came from the Congo.
"We don't see the Congolese
situation as an economic loss,"
concluded the Belgian, "but the
loss of great friends whom we
held in esteem. We were trying
to impart to them that which we
had achieved."


BELGIAN CONSUL MARCEL RIJMENANS AT RECEPTION
"The Belgians are interested in the well being of Congolese"
"We tried to create a Belgium
in Central Africa. One can take
this as a positive good or the
great sin of superiority; we did
it in the spirit of friendship." So
the San Francisco Belgian Consul
Marcel Rijmenans analyzed his
country's policy in a campus de
bate in Toyon Lounge last night.
Rijmenans faced Stanford Afri
can student Michael Ero iji a pro
gram entitled "Congo Crisis" mod
erated by Assistant Dean of Men
David Larimer and sponsored by
El Cuadro Club.
The evening's contentions re
volved around the question of the
amount of progress achieved in
the Congo under the fifty years
of Belgian direction. Rijmenans
pursued his stand by stating the
Belgians were being evaluated on
the basis of something they hadn't
had a chance to complete: they
hadn't expected independence to
come so quickly- "It takes more
than fifty years to impart great
spirit and traditions to a people."
AFRICAN-BORN Ero expressed
the feelings of the rebellious Afri
can provinces, "One culture can
not be forced upon another; one
people cannot force another to
think their way. Every imperial
ist culture has made the mistake
of trying to force a culture upon
a society; you cannot move a so
ciety from one part of the world
to another."
Ero did not view the primary
motive of the Belgians as this cul
ture exchange, though. "When
the whites first came they found
just tribes, no nation. They ex
ploited Africa and took her peo
ple."
"Belgium is staying in the Con
go abusing our sovereignty, show
ing her militarism. There is some
thing fishy about the professed
motive of stationing troops to
protect Belgian women and chil
dren when the troops are put in
tliose places in which there was
no revolt. The economic resources
of the Congo were all the Belgians
wanted."
