# UN 						Should Stop Russ Congo Gains
## 
### 
Early last week a vote of the Security Council gave the United
Nations the mandate to stop the barbaric internal strife between fac
tions in the Congo. Since that time the Leftist-oriented cligue of
Antoine Gizenga has established itself over half of the Congo. They
were seemingly unopposed by the Kasavubu government, by the
U.N. forces under command of India's Mr. Dayal, or the Belgian
backed troops of Mr. Tsombe.
Mr. Gizenga's amazing feat only points up the anarchy that still
exists in the Congo. True Gizenga's troops have been supplied with
eguipment and munitions from the Soviet bloc as well as being
backed by some Leftist African countries. However, these are not
reasons enough to explain the decisiveness of Mr. Gizenga's vic
tory. It is apparent that the population as a whole is having nothing
to do with either the native politicians or the military cligues which
they seek to conrol.
As long as this situation of constant flux exists there can be no
Congo solution. The U.N. command must reassert itself and restore
order in the Congo, even if force is needed to erase the superficial
gains of Mr. Gizenga. But at the moment the United Nations com
mander, Mr. Dayal, seems ineffective. The manner in which he is
acting is clear reason for the Soviets to have abstained from vetoing
last week's U.N. resolution. For the Soviets did not have to incur
the wrath of the African bloc of countries by vetoing the Congo res
olution. Mr. Dayal is giving the Congo to the Moscow-backed Gi
zenga.
For instance, last week Dayal did not clear the information of the
slaying of 15 Congolese, including a Senator, until a British diplomat
in Leopoldville told the press of the killing.
A few days before, the U.N. command refused to put itself be
tween the Kasavubu forces in Lulubong and Gizenga's soldiers from
Stanleyville when the latter arrived. Mr. Dayal issued a statement
which claimed that the Gizenga forces were received hospitably, but
th U.N. troops on the scene were from pro-Gizenga Ghana.
It is all very understandable that Mr. Dayal is trying to prove that
the United Nations and Mr. Hammarskjold are not pro-Western in
order to appease the Africans and the Soviets. Yet Mr. Dayal's Su
detenland has become half of the Congo. The United States has care
fully refrained from criticizing these disastrous policies for fear of
offending Mr. Nehru. While following this line of reasoning we have
allowed half of the Congo to come under Communist domination.
It is time for the United States, through the United Nations, to
insist that Mr. Dayal take appropriate action to establish a solid status
guo. If he cannot, the United Nations should find a command who
can construct a status quo which will go beyond the divided loyalties
of some illiterate, ill-disciplined troops. Failure to find such a settle
ment would be a defeat for the United Nations.

tions in the Congo. Since that time the Leftist-oriented cligue of
Antoine Gizenga has established itself over half of the Congo. They
were seemingly unopposed by the Kasavubu government, by the
U.N. forces under command of India's Mr. Dayal, or the Belgian
backed troops of Mr. Tsombe.
Mr. Gizenga's amazing feat only points up the anarchy that still
exists in the Congo. True Gizenga's troops have been supplied with
eguipment and munitions from the Soviet bloc as well as being
backed by some Leftist African countries. However, these are not
reasons enough to explain the decisiveness of Mr. Gizenga's vic
tory. It is apparent that the population as a whole is having nothing
to do with either the native politicians or the military cligues which
they seek to conrol.
As long as this situation of constant flux exists there can be no
Congo solution. The U.N. command must reassert itself and restore
order in the Congo, even if force is needed to erase the superficial
gains of Mr. Gizenga. But at the moment the United Nations com
mander, Mr. Dayal, seems ineffective. The manner in which he is
acting is clear reason for the Soviets to have abstained from vetoing
last week's U.N. resolution. For the Soviets did not have to incur
the wrath of the African bloc of countries by vetoing the Congo res
olution. Mr. Dayal is giving the Congo to the Moscow-backed Gi
zenga.
For instance, last week Dayal did not clear the information of the
slaying of 15 Congolese, including a Senator, until a British diplomat
in Leopoldville told the press of the killing.
A few days before, the U.N. command refused to put itself be
tween the Kasavubu forces in Lulubong and Gizenga's soldiers from
Stanleyville when the latter arrived. Mr. Dayal issued a statement
which claimed that the Gizenga forces were received hospitably, but
th U.N. troops on the scene were from pro-Gizenga Ghana.
It is all very understandable that Mr. Dayal is trying to prove that
the United Nations and Mr. Hammarskjold are not pro-Western in
order to appease the Africans and the Soviets. Yet Mr. Dayal's Su
detenland has become half of the Congo. The United States has care
fully refrained from criticizing these disastrous policies for fear of
offending Mr. Nehru. While following this line of reasoning we have
allowed half of the Congo to come under Communist domination.
It is time for the United States, through the United Nations, to
insist that Mr. Dayal take appropriate action to establish a solid status
guo. If he cannot, the United Nations should find a command who
can construct a status quo which will go beyond the divided loyalties
of some illiterate, ill-disciplined troops. Failure to find such a settle
ment would be a defeat for the United Nations.
Early last week a vote of the Security Council gave the United
Nations the mandate to stop the barbaric internal strife between fac
tions in the Congo. Since that time the Leftist-oriented cligue of
Antoine Gizenga has established itself over half of the Congo. They
were seemingly unopposed by the Kasavubu government, by the
U.N. forces under command of India's Mr. Dayal, or the Belgian
