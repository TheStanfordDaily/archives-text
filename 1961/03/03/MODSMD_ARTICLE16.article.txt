From the Los Angeles Times
In its projection of the nation's manpower potential of the 19605,
the Labor Department emphasized that economic growth and living
standards improvement depend upon a labor force that would not
only increase numerically, but also in education and skills.
Among the report's hopeful predictions, however, was the expec
tation that in the 60s almost one-third of the young people entering
the labor market would lack a high school education. Of the esti
mated 7.5 million without a high school diploma, 2.5 million will
not even have finished grade school.
These are startling statistics when set beside the exploding en
rollments at colleges and universities. They represent a dilemma,
moreover, that grows with every graduation ceremony.
The class of '61 this June will include some 1,873,000 students,
but missing from the ceremonies will be approximately 900,000 who
dropped out of school. There will, in addition, be an estimated 880,000
graduates who will not go on to full- or part-time college work.
In the frenzied rush to university gates, those who simply lack
the capacity to take advantage of higher education have largely been
ignored. The overemphasis upon collegiate training, in the words of
John Gardner, Carnegie Corporation president, leads them to believe
they "have landed on the scrap heap and that further learning or
growth is out of the guestion."
Gardner is the head of a foundation that has given millions of
dollars to aid higher education, yet he is sharply critical of the tragic
waste that results from a national "obsession with college degrees."
He objects to this false emphasis on both practical and philosophical
grounds and calls for a reassessment of the real meaning of education.
"Properly understood, a college or university is merely the instru
ment of one kind of further education for those whose interests and
capacities fit them for that kind of further education."
Gardner complains that "most parents, teachers and counselors
have given Tittle or no thought to the ways of learning and growing
that do not involve college." His proposals that high schools provide
more and better vocational training plus continuous vocational and
educational counseling service through age 21 may not be the best
or even most acceptable solution.
There can, however, be no disagreement with his contention that
"When the populace as a whole comes to recognize that education
should be an enduring thing in their lives and can take place in a
variety of settings, then the artificial emphasis on certain types of
education will recede."
College and university education must not be "regarded as the
sole means of establishing human worth . . . the unigue key to hap
piness, self respect and inner confidence."
"The crowding in our colleges," he concludes, "is less regrettable
than the confusion in our values."
