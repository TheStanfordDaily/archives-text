## Kennedy Changes U.S. Position on German Aid 
### 
The negotiations with West Ger
many, which have been under way
since November, took a promising
turn last week during the visit of
the Foreign Minister, Dr. von
Brentano. Assuming that the
general agreements reached are
translated into specific measures,
the negotiations are a success.
The reason for the success is
not that the Adenauer govern
ment has been willing to do for
the Kennedy administration what
it had refused to do for the Eisen
hower administration. The reason
is that the American case has
been restudied, revised, and re \
formulated. This was done by a !
panel of experts chosen by the i
President to study the problem of
the balance of payments. The
chairman of this panel, or task j
force as it is called, was Mr.!
George Ball, the Under Secretary'
of State for Economic Affairs.
THE BASIC' difference between
the Eisenhower • Anderson ap
proach and the new Kennedy-Ball

proach and the
new Kennedy -
Ball approach is
in the analysis of
the problem. The
Eisenhower - An
derson view was
that we were
spending too
much abroad on
international de
fense and devel
opment. We ask-

ed our Allies, and particularly
Germany, to spend more in
order that we might spend less.
This approach was morally un
acceptable to the Germans in that
it called upon them to pay for the
American troops who are now in
Germany. It was humiliating for
the United States in that it put us
in the position of asking the Ger
mans to help us.
The Kennedy-Ball view is not
that we should spend less on in
ternational defense and develop
ment but that Germany and the
other surplus countries should
spend more. If they do that, and
if certain other measures are
taken—such as coordinating in
terest rates and making our ex
ports more competitive—our defi
cit and the German surplus will
both be reduced, and international

transactions will tend 1o come inlo
equilibrium.
Last week the Bonn government
accepted the Administration's an
alysis of the problem and agreed
! to begin a program of loans and
grants for foreign aid in the order
of perhaps a billion dollars a year.
This German decision will be good
for the countries that receive the
German aid. It will be good for
the United States, in that West
Germany, by investing or- spend
ing a billion dollars more abroad,
will cease to suck up so many of
! the dollars which we spend
abroad. It will be good for West
Germany.
THE GERMAN affair is the
first of the several hot issues
which the Administration has
been able to deal with. The man
ner in which it has been done aug
urs well. The negotiations were
conducted quietly and firmly be
cause the Administration had de
veloped a new basis of policy and
was not bogged down in the
| stereotypes of the old one. No
small part of the credit for this
belongs to Mr. Ball, who is both
experienced and expert, not al
ways the same thing, in the po
litical economy of Western Eu
rope.
The temper of the negotiations
was characteristic of the Presi
dent in that the whole business

was understated and desensatien
ali/.ed. In the end, as in all suc
cessful diplomacy, there were no
winners and no losers hut there
is advantage for everyone.
It is 100 soon to say whether in
Laos and the Congo any compara
ble diplomatic success can be
achieved. There, we are dealing
. not with Adenauer but with Khru
' shchev. There is civil war and
! there are atrocities which arouse
j not only the primitive feelings of
j primitive people but also the
! primitive feelings of civilized men.
There, we have in a certain meas
ure lost our freedom of action,
; having been unwisely and too
| deeply engaged with clients and
! puppets.
However, provided that Mr.
| Khrushchev had understood what
President Kennedy means about
unilateral intervention, a modus
vivendi should be possible in Laos.
It may not be altogether impos
sible in the Congo. The declara
j tion of neutrality just made by
the King of Laos is a good sign.
It indicates that we have been us
ing our influence in Laos more
wisely than formerly. On the
road that the King has opened, a
stabilization could be arrived at.
Perhaps it will be arrived at if
the Soviets take a cold view of
the relative importance of Laos
j and if our policy remains as it
; has now become, pragmatic and
sophisticated.
IN THE Congo no "solution"
is now conceivable in the sense
that a unified, tranquil, "free"
state can be set up. What is not
impossible is that the United Na
tions will find enough support
among the Afro-Asian and the
Latin American states, and among

the great powers of the West, 1o
contain the inevitable disorder, to
keep military intervention by the
Soviet Union, the United Arab Re
public, and by Belgium to a mini
mum.
This is the purpose of American

J policy. It should not be frustrated
j by those who want to engage the
United States and its Allies in a
military intervention which, oner
lit were started, no one would
know how to end.

The negotiations with West Ger
many, which have been under way
since November, took a promising
turn last week during the visit of
the Foreign Minister, Dr. von
Brentano. Assuming that the
general agreements reached are
translated into specific measures,
the negotiations are a success.
The reason for the success is
not that the Adenauer govern
ment has been willing to do for
the Kennedy administration what
it had refused to do for the Eisen
hower administration. The reason
is that the American case has
been restudied, revised, and re \
formulated. This was done by a !
panel of experts chosen by the i
President to study the problem of
the balance of payments. The
chairman of this panel, or task j
force as it is called, was Mr.!
George Ball, the Under Secretary'
of State for Economic Affairs.
THE BASIC' difference between
the Eisenhower • Anderson ap
proach and the new Kennedy-Ball

proach and the
new Kennedy -
Ball approach is
in the analysis of
the problem. The
Eisenhower - An
derson view was
that we were
spending too
much abroad on
international de
fense and devel
opment. We ask-

ed our Allies, and particularly
Germany, to spend more in
order that we might spend less.
This approach was morally un
acceptable to the Germans in that
it called upon them to pay for the
American troops who are now in
Germany. It was humiliating for
the United States in that it put us
in the position of asking the Ger
mans to help us.
The Kennedy-Ball view is not
that we should spend less on in
ternational defense and develop
ment but that Germany and the
other surplus countries should
spend more. If they do that, and
if certain other measures are
taken—such as coordinating in
terest rates and making our ex
ports more competitive—our defi
cit and the German surplus will
both be reduced, and international

transactions will tend 1o come inlo
equilibrium.
Last week the Bonn government
accepted the Administration's an
alysis of the problem and agreed
! to begin a program of loans and
grants for foreign aid in the order
of perhaps a billion dollars a year.
This German decision will be good
for the countries that receive the
German aid. It will be good for
the United States, in that West
Germany, by investing or- spend
ing a billion dollars more abroad,
will cease to suck up so many of
! the dollars which we spend
abroad. It will be good for West
Germany.
THE GERMAN affair is the
first of the several hot issues
which the Administration has
been able to deal with. The man
ner in which it has been done aug
urs well. The negotiations were
conducted quietly and firmly be
cause the Administration had de
veloped a new basis of policy and
was not bogged down in the
| stereotypes of the old one. No
small part of the credit for this
belongs to Mr. Ball, who is both
experienced and expert, not al
ways the same thing, in the po
litical economy of Western Eu
rope.
The temper of the negotiations
was characteristic of the Presi
dent in that the whole business

was understated and desensatien
ali/.ed. In the end, as in all suc
cessful diplomacy, there were no
winners and no losers hut there
is advantage for everyone.
It is 100 soon to say whether in
Laos and the Congo any compara
ble diplomatic success can be
achieved. There, we are dealing
. not with Adenauer but with Khru
' shchev. There is civil war and
! there are atrocities which arouse
j not only the primitive feelings of
j primitive people but also the
! primitive feelings of civilized men.
There, we have in a certain meas
ure lost our freedom of action,
; having been unwisely and too
| deeply engaged with clients and
! puppets.
However, provided that Mr.
| Khrushchev had understood what
President Kennedy means about
unilateral intervention, a modus
vivendi should be possible in Laos.
It may not be altogether impos
sible in the Congo. The declara
j tion of neutrality just made by
the King of Laos is a good sign.
It indicates that we have been us
ing our influence in Laos more
wisely than formerly. On the
road that the King has opened, a
stabilization could be arrived at.
Perhaps it will be arrived at if
the Soviets take a cold view of
the relative importance of Laos
j and if our policy remains as it
; has now become, pragmatic and
sophisticated.
IN THE Congo no "solution"
is now conceivable in the sense
that a unified, tranquil, "free"
state can be set up. What is not
impossible is that the United Na
tions will find enough support
among the Afro-Asian and the
Latin American states, and among

the great powers of the West, 1o
contain the inevitable disorder, to
keep military intervention by the
Soviet Union, the United Arab Re
public, and by Belgium to a mini
mum.
This is the purpose of American

J policy. It should not be frustrated
j by those who want to engage the
United States and its Allies in a
military intervention which, oner
lit were started, no one would
know how to end.

The negotiations with West Ger
many, which have been under way
since November, took a promising
turn last week during the visit of
the Foreign Minister, Dr. von
Brentano. Assuming that the
general agreements reached are
translated into specific measures,
the negotiations are a success.
The reason for the success is
not that the Adenauer govern
ment has been willing to do for
the Kennedy administration what
it had refused to do for the Eisen
hower administration. The reason
is that the American case has
been restudied, revised, and re \
formulated. This was done by a !
panel of experts chosen by the i
President to study the problem of
the balance of payments. The
chairman of this panel, or task j
force as it is called, was Mr.!
George Ball, the Under Secretary'
of State for Economic Affairs.
THE BASIC' difference between
the Eisenhower • Anderson ap
proach and the new Kennedy-Ball

proach and the
new Kennedy -
Ball approach is
in the analysis of
the problem. The
Eisenhower - An
derson view was
that we were
spending too
much abroad on
international de
fense and devel
opment. We ask-

ed our Allies, and particularly
Germany, to spend more in
order that we might spend less.
This approach was morally un
acceptable to the Germans in that
it called upon them to pay for the
American troops who are now in
Germany. It was humiliating for
the United States in that it put us
in the position of asking the Ger
mans to help us.
The Kennedy-Ball view is not
that we should spend less on in
ternational defense and develop
ment but that Germany and the
other surplus countries should
spend more. If they do that, and
if certain other measures are
taken—such as coordinating in
terest rates and making our ex
ports more competitive—our defi
cit and the German surplus will
both be reduced, and international

transactions will tend 1o come inlo
equilibrium.
Last week the Bonn government
accepted the Administration's an
alysis of the problem and agreed
! to begin a program of loans and
grants for foreign aid in the order
of perhaps a billion dollars a year.
This German decision will be good
for the countries that receive the
German aid. It will be good for
the United States, in that West
Germany, by investing or- spend
ing a billion dollars more abroad,
will cease to suck up so many of
! the dollars which we spend
abroad. It will be good for West
Germany.
THE GERMAN affair is the
first of the several hot issues
which the Administration has
been able to deal with. The man
ner in which it has been done aug
urs well. The negotiations were
conducted quietly and firmly be
cause the Administration had de
veloped a new basis of policy and
was not bogged down in the
| stereotypes of the old one. No
small part of the credit for this
belongs to Mr. Ball, who is both
experienced and expert, not al
ways the same thing, in the po
litical economy of Western Eu
rope.
The temper of the negotiations
was characteristic of the Presi
dent in that the whole business

was understated and desensatien
ali/.ed. In the end, as in all suc
cessful diplomacy, there were no
winners and no losers hut there
is advantage for everyone.
It is 100 soon to say whether in
Laos and the Congo any compara
ble diplomatic success can be
achieved. There, we are dealing
. not with Adenauer but with Khru
' shchev. There is civil war and
! there are atrocities which arouse
j not only the primitive feelings of
j primitive people but also the
! primitive feelings of civilized men.
There, we have in a certain meas
ure lost our freedom of action,
; having been unwisely and too
| deeply engaged with clients and
! puppets.
However, provided that Mr.
| Khrushchev had understood what
President Kennedy means about
unilateral intervention, a modus
vivendi should be possible in Laos.
It may not be altogether impos
sible in the Congo. The declara
j tion of neutrality just made by
the King of Laos is a good sign.
It indicates that we have been us
ing our influence in Laos more
wisely than formerly. On the
road that the King has opened, a
stabilization could be arrived at.
Perhaps it will be arrived at if
the Soviets take a cold view of
the relative importance of Laos
j and if our policy remains as it
; has now become, pragmatic and
sophisticated.
IN THE Congo no "solution"
is now conceivable in the sense
that a unified, tranquil, "free"
state can be set up. What is not
impossible is that the United Na
tions will find enough support
among the Afro-Asian and the
Latin American states, and among

the great powers of the West, 1o
contain the inevitable disorder, to
keep military intervention by the
Soviet Union, the United Arab Re
public, and by Belgium to a mini
mum.
This is the purpose of American

J policy. It should not be frustrated
j by those who want to engage the
United States and its Allies in a
military intervention which, oner
lit were started, no one would
