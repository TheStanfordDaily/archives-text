## Red China Just Like Mr. Claus 
### 
Rod China is kind of like Santa
Claus and tho Eastey Bunnyâ€”it
isn't.
After more than <450 years, il
took an organization like the
United Nations to prove Colum
bus wrong. Despite the famed
voyager's belief, the earth is not
round, but ends in a huge void
right near the USSR boundary.
NOT ONLY geographers have
been swindled in this huge hoax.

though, census
takers fell to tlu i
bait too. Foi
years, huge num
bers of people

One wonder?
why the 619 mil !

estimated to be

in "China" have not been deduct
ed from world population figures.
Actually, removing them isn't all
that simple; complications arise.
For instance, foreign affairs ex
pert Senator Barry Goldwater
doesn't believe there is a Russia
either, which would deduct an
other 200 million, and push boun
daries back ever farther. And he
has a pretty good case too. Just
imagine how well things would
work out should the two areas in
doubt be eliminated.
For one thing, world tension
would cease. Without the USSR,
as well as discussion pertaining to
the mythical land it propagates,
the cold war would come to a joy
ous climax. There would be no
more haggling in the UN, no need
to worry about Communist viola
tions of the Charter. It isn't only
the cold war that would be solved,
either.
WE COULI) stop all this ridicu
lous banter about Red Chinese
and Russian Communists gaining
influence in newly independent
African countries, as well as
South American hot-spots. There
is certainly nothing to worry
about in 619 million worth of mili
tant myth.
One can only hope that the es
teemed body of the United Na
tions quickly recognizes the ad
vantages of squelching this rumor
quickly, and permanently. Every
thing from war threats to the
population explosion and food
problems could be halted in one
decisive measure to eliminate
these people lhat make reading
the morning paper unpleasant.
It's just as my mother used to
tell me: what we don't know won't
hurt us.
