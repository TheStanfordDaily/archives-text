## â€˜Jugendweihe' Creates Intellectual Disunity 
### SIGRID MAURER 
(Editor's note: The following is
an article by Sigrid Maurer, the
current Hli scholar from the Free
University of Berlin to Stanford.
As a part of a special Berlin Week
report she writes on one of the
main factors creating an intellec
tual disunity between East and
West Germany.)

Since the end of the second
world war a strong emphasis has!
been laid upon the attempt to re
establish external political unity
in Germany under one govern-1
ment and one constitution.
But there is some doubt whether
the mere establishment of one
government and one constitution
would insure a unified nation.
The essence of a politically uni
fied Germany must be an ideologi
cal or intellectual unity, an open
mindedness, on the basis of which
a mutual understanding of ihe
goals of society and the role of the
state will be possible.
At the moment the youth of
Germany who later will be the:
maintainor of an ideological unity, j
travel divergent courses intellec-j
tually. Very often in a discussion !
between young people from East j
and West Germany, either the rea- j
soiling does not seem logical or
the participants do not under
stand the point made by each
other.
THEY talk at cross purposes'
because they begin from quite)
different assumptions built upon j
basically different "Weltanschau- j
urigen." One of the phenomena j
which has increased the ideologi-1
cal divergence between East and j
West Germany is the proclama
tion of the "Jugendweihe" in East [
Germany.
"JUGENDWEIHE" or conse
cration of the youth to the state'
is the equivalent of confirmation '
in the protestant or Catholic
churches. It is a phenomenon
which grows out of a tradition
about 100 years old.
The Jugendweihe before 1933
was practiced by free-thinking
minority groups which because of
their ideals of political freedom
and equality often were in oppo
sition to the more or less undemo- \
cratic government.
IN 1933 the character of the!
Jugendweihe changed drastically.!
Under Hitler the Jugendweihe!
took on the character of a state 1
practice and pledged the whole
youth, including the Christians,
to an ideological political goal:
Deutschturn (the German charac
ter t.
After the war the Jugendweihe
reverted to its former character
in West Germany and died out I
completely in the East Zone. In
1954, however, in the East Zone
of Germany a newly created "Cen- j
tral Committee for Jugendweihen
in the German Democratic Repub
lic" published an appeal that!
young people, regardless of their!
denomination, should participate
in the Jugendweihe, it was an
alarming sign for the older gen- j
eration which just recently had
experienced the consequences of :
Hitler's Jugendweihe program.
WHEN IN November 1954 the!
public notice was given, the fol-1
lowing goals and principles were |
proclaimed: "The character of the
Jugendweihe will not be that of !
opposition against the govern-'
ment. as before 1933, but that of 1
readiness and obligation to par- j
ticipate actively in the realization j
of progress in life, society, and j
state."
Jugendweihe is neither the in-1
strument of the state nor that of i
single organizations. Juveniles of:
all world outlooks may partici
pate. Jugendweihe does not eon !
flict with confirmation. Freedom ;
of creed and conscience is fully
guaranteed. Participation is vol-1
untary. The two main character-1
istics which coincide with the!
main characteristics of the Nazi
Jugendweihe are conspicuous: All j
children including the Christians!
are eligible. From the very be- j
ginning the goal was a consecra- j
tion of the whole youth to the;
state, the "state of laborers and !
farmers," on the basis of the "pro-1
gressive" philosophy of the athe-,
ist-materialist ideology.
AFTER THE first discussions
of the Jugendweihe by official in
stitutions and the church the true
goals of the new Jugendweihe
gradually came out. Implicit in
Ihe proclamation is a contradic
tion. How can a person who be
lieves in God swear simultaneous
ly to the pursuits of atheism and i
marxism, which deny Christianj
belief as a nonscientific irrational!
myth?
Jugendweihe solemnly initiates]
the young persons into Ihe new j
socialist society. Like a state re- j
ligion it replaces the ecclesiastic
ceremonies with eultie arrange
ments in the context of a material-!
ist it* philosophy. Many persons
have attempted to distinguish Na
/ism from Communism by oppos-.
ing the N'azist mixture of politics
with religion and governmental
with national and cultic forms, to
communistic atheism; this dis
tinction is no longer valid.
Til 10 NEW c >tnmunMic belief
in progress is expressed in quite:
cultic practices: for instance, in
young pioneers, kissing the flag, I
in marching columns of boys and
girls, and the use ot words with
jcligioiis connotations in their]

ceremonies, such as "consecra
tion" and "dedication."
The Jugendweihe also has its
"bible," the book "Weltall - Erde-
Mensch" (Universe - Earth - Man t,
which is a compilation of the evo
lution of nature and society.
Christianity, the book says,
constitutes nothing but one step
in the evolution which contributed
considerably to the development
of mankind.
THUS IT becomes evident that
the preparation for the Jugend
weihe does not mean only instruc
tion in atheism and materialism,
but also implies the aim of pro
ducing politically credulous youth
bound by oath to the state. This
aim of the new Jugendweihe is in
its major characteristics little dif
ferent from the movement under
Hitler.
What then is the possible long
term effect of the Jugendweihe?
The longer it exists, the more
deeply its philosophy gets rooted
in the minds of the young people,
the less flexible, the less ready to
re-examine its belief will this
youth be, when Germany is uni
fied in the future.
The Jugendweihe thus becomes
a major force counteracting the
creation of an intellectual unity
in a unified Germany, and the
longer Germany remains sepa
rated, the harder it will be to cre
ate this spiritual unity.
