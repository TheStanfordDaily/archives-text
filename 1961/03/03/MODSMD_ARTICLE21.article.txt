Berlin. Here she writes on tier
man student government.)

Student government at Berlin's
Free University is in many re
spects different from ours in
theory as well as in practice.
Generally, I am favorably im
pressed with the many opportuni
ties for direct student control here
at the Free University and with
many highly qualified students
who hold the reins of control.
BUT. democratically speaking,
there is no effective campaign
during which even conscientious
students can learn enough about
each candidate to be able to make
sound judgments and choices, and
aside from a 3-minute speech from
each candidate before a student
assembly and a few mimeo
graphed papers, there is nothing
done to maintain their interest in
the activities of the student gov
ernment or to keep them informed
of its activities.
Pressure groups get out the
votes for those candidates serving
their interests, and the result is a
Konvent (legislative council) in
which political interest blocks
struggle against one another,
often at the expense of the inter
ests of the university student
body as a whole.
There is one aspect which is
virtually unknown to us tlie mix
ing of the national political par
ties in the student government.
THE (iEKMAN national politi
cal parties morally and financial
ly, the latter unofficially, support
student party organizations on
the university campuses; the stu
dent organizations respond by
supporting as a block the policies
of the national parties, and they
hold their greatest power of ef
fectiveness in t he Konvent.
At the Free University the
struggle is between the RODS, the
child of t he Christian Democrats
(Adenauer's party), the two main
more left-leaning parties, and the
independents. What powers do the
students have to begin with, which
party power struggles could
abuse?
AT THE FREE University they
hold an exceptionally large num
ber; the university was founded in
1948 by students who had left the
Humboldt University in East Ber
lin in protest to tlie increasing
Soviet academic controls, and the
students to this day have retained
many of their rights of initiative
in academic and administrative af
fairs. There are too many to list
here, but a few examples will give
an idea.
1) The Free University is one
of the most popular in Germany,
and because of its geographical
position and strictly limited faeili

ties, the enrollment must be selec
tive. (This is not the rule in
Germany.) The new students are,
in practice, selected for each Fa
kultaet, or college, by one Kon
vent member, who is elected by
all the Konvent members of his
Fakultaet and approved by the
entire Konvent.
This chairman naturally at
least partially favors admitting
students of his own political lean
ings and opinions, and therefore
the face of the entire university is
to a large extent determined by
the kind of people who hold these
10 positions.
2) The Konvent can direct or
prevent contact with students in
East Germany. The RCDS mem
bers are against sponsoring any
activity having the slighest con
nection with the Soviet Zone;
left-leaning students and many in
dependents are for at least some
unofficial contact. For instance,
there is a small student organiza
tion which presents outstanding
films, and it obtains some of them
from East Germany. The RCDS

is working lo remove this organ
ization from the university.
3) One ol the hottest issues at
the Free Unhersity concerns the
admittance of Ihe "sehlagede Ver
bindungen." These are the old, tra
ditional Ger m a n fraternities,
whose members wear colored
bands and caps, emphasize faith
ful comradeship within the fra
ternity, and whose prospective
members must prove their cour
age in a sword fi^lit.
Their opponents call them
biased, anarchistic, militaristic,
and reactionary.
Their supporters claim that
these fraternities have given up
their undesirable ways and are
now "progressive conservatives."
BKFOKK THIS fall the schla
gende V-erbindungen were spe
cifically prohibited from the uni
versity. but under a new article
in the constitution the Konvent
now holds the key to their admis
sion or continued rejection. A
large number of the IiCDS mem
bers suport their entrance and.
with a clear majority in the Kon

vent, would surely carry through
a bill of admission.
What is the general student in
terest in their government and
its election? In the first election,
ti1.73 per cent of the entire student
body voted, a drop of more than
4 per cent over last year.
But despite thes 1 not unimpres
sive figures, general student
apathy is great. Because of the ad
j ministrative set-up and physical
layout of the university, total ig
I norance of student government is
much more possible here than ai
Stanford, and many remain total
S iy ignorant.
Till: STI'DKNT government is
completely run by a core of about
i 100 avidly interested and active
! students. These students work

hard, giving up from 75 to 100
| per cent of their studies during
j the time from one to three years
i in which the> hold student gov
i ernment positions. The majority
of them are sharp speakers and
■ thinkers, speak out emphatically
any time they have something to
say, are highly capable, conscien
tious, and organized.
This 1 say on the basis of my
I acquaintance with some and ob
servations in the (<ffices, at the
election general assemblies, and
at a Konvent meeting, which
lasted one night from 7 p.m. until
j 3:30 a.m.
