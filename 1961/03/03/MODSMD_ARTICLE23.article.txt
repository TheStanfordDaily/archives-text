## Undefeated Ruggers Meet Cal in ‘Crucial’ 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford's undefeated rugby team will be seeking its first win in
its last fifteen starts against California and its ninth straight win of
the season, when the Cards take on the always tough Bear ruggers
tomorrow in Berkeley's Memorial Stadium at 3 p.m.
In a preliminary contest at 1 p.m., the likewise undefeated JV

ruggers are hoping to extend
their seven-game winning streak
at the expense of the Blue and
Gold junior varsity.
THE LAST time the Indian
rugby men defeated the Berkeley
ites was way back in 1953, and
Stanford currently trails in the
Big Scrum series, winning 11,
losing 31 and tieing 1.
The clash will undoubtedly be
the most, eye-catching rugby
match in many years with bands,
yell leaders, pompon girls and
mascots promised on both sides.
In addition, a beaded hatchet
contrived by Stanford's Prince
Lightfoot will be introduced as a
perpetual trophy. The winner will
be determined by total points
scored by each team in the two
game series if there is a split.
THE SECOND match will be
played in Stanford Stadium next
Saturday.
Cal has a 4-1-1 record with both
the tie and the loss coming from
the University of British Colum
bia in World Cup competition by
3-3 ad 8-3 scores respectively.
In other clashes, the Bears
edged the Universities' Alumni,
N-6, throttled St. Mary's 23-8.
tripped UCLA 9-s,and beat USC
9-3.
THE LOSS to the Canadians
was the Cal ruggers' first loss in
35 contests, when the same ÜBC
team turned the trick in April,
1958. The Bears haven't lost to
an American college team since
the Tribe whipped them in 1953.
Featured in the Berkeleyites at
tack is big John Harrison from
Sidney, Australia. Harrison is the
Cal kicker, and he does his job
well, as a 53-yard penalty kick
against British Columbia will at
test.
Captain Jim Burress, a Blue and
Gold gridder in the off season,
and Jerry Papini, Gael Barsotti
and Tom Fraser are other stick -
outs for the Bears.
