# Cagers Meet Trojans

Stanford's disappointing basket
ball team, reeling but still trying
to end the season on a happy note,
takes on the Trojans of USC to
morrow night in the Los Angeles
Sports Arena at 9 p.m.
This is the second to last week
end of the long campaign for
Coach Howie Dallmar's crew and
an upset win would be just what
the doctor ordered.
THE INDIANS are still numb
from their tragic double defeat at
the hands of California two weeks
ago. The second game saw the

Cards blow a 21 -point half lime ad
vantage under Cal's full court
press.
The last time the Cards met the
Trojans was on Feb. 10 at the Pa
vilion and Stanford gave the high
ly regarded Southlanders a good
battle, finally bowing 57-63.
But this game should be even
tougher for the Indians, currently
sporting a 7-1-1 record. USC is
10th ranked nationally with a 17-
5 mark.
Heading the attack fyr Troy is
6-6 center John Rudometkin. Rodo
is Ihe scoring leader of the team
hitting for a 25 points per game
average. With his mixture of
jumps, hooks and shovel shots
this promising junior is tough to
stop and received second-team All-
America honors from both the
AP and the UPI news services
this week.
KKN STANLEY, the team cap

tain, and the elusive Verne Ashby
are at the forward slots. Ashby's
clutch rebounding and unexpected
scoring played an important part
in the first round between the two
teams.
Chris Appel and Neil Edwards
round out the Trojan starting line
up at guard and if not spectacular
they are at least adequate.
Stanford Will go with the usual
first team of John Hendry and

John Windsor at forwards, Mike
Lodgerwood at center, and Bub
Bowling and Don Clemetson at
the guards.

Tomorrow's basketball game
with USC will be carried by KCBS
radio, AM and FM at 9 p.m.
