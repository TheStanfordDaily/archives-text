FORT MYERS, Fla. (UPI) 1
Dick Groat had a blunt answer
today for those baseball know-it
alls who already are pegging the
world champion Pittsburgh Pi- j
rates as a bunch of one-shot won
ders.
I
"That's a lot of frog fuzz,"
snapped the Pirate shortstop,
: starting to show some crimson l
around his neck.
"The people who are going |
around saying we can't possibly
I win again are the same ones who
kept saying we'd fold last August,
j They don't know what they're!
; battin* about.
"THERE'S just as much desire
among us now, if not more, than ;
there was when we went into the
| World Series against the Yankees
; last fall. Why shouldn't we win i
1 again? Essentially, we're a young
club. We have the pitching, the
| experience and the know-how.
"Hey, Skin!" Groat called out
, to teammate Bob Skinner, waiting 1
to hit nearby. "Do you think any
j one's gonna beat us this year?"
"Hell, no," Skinner replied.
"We'll win. We need the money."
"DARN right we'll win again," i
I Groat nodded. "We tasted ih;ii
i World Series melon and we have
every intention of coming back
1 for a second helping."
Groat, who has always been un
commonly modest even as an All
! American basketball star at Duke
during his college days, plays I
down his own part in the Pirates' j
triumph last year even though he
led the National League in batting j
with a .325 average and was
chosen ihe circuit's most valuable ;
player.
1 "Twenty-four other guys and j

the manager made it possible for
me to win the MVP award," he
said. "There were a lot of MVP's
on our club. The way I feel,
1 merely accepted the award for
all the other fellows on the team."
