(EDITOR'S NOTE: The follow
ing is tlie second of three dis
patches on a revolution in higher
education.)

The need for more facilities,
plus bigger faculties, plus in
creased funds equals a triple head
ache in higher education.
Dr. Edward H. Litchfield, chan
cellor of the University of Pitts
burgh, sees in the trimester sys
tem a kind of super medicine ca
pable of solving some of the finan
cial and related aches.
Look at Pennsylvania, for ex
ample. Litchfield said that assum
ing the old academic calendar
two semesters a year remained
in force, some $750 million must
be spent in that state for addi
tional plant and equipment to
meet mushrooming enrollments.
AND nationwide, there's a com
parable estimate. Litchfield said
the only competent national sur
vey shows that a conservative pro
jection of capital plan needs, as
suming the old calendar prevails
in the next decade, is better than
$10 billion.
"While no one can be sure,"
Litchfield said, "a reasonably con
servitive judgment suggests that
we can cut that $750 million in
Pennsylvania to less than $500
million.
"And we could cut $10 billion in
the nation to about $6 billion if
we are willing to seriously recon
sider the old calendar."

Consider faculties. Nationally,
(he need is estimated al 346,000
J during the next decade. "But the
j prospect is of less than 30 per
I cent actually becoming available,"
; Litchfield said.
"I GRANT here that the ulti
! mate solution is more people
j coming into the leaching profes
i sion, and this in turn is dependent
; upon a new value upon learning
which will bring them in, but this
! will take several generations.
"In the meantime, we must
l make what we have go as far as
| we possibly can."
And as the educator figures it,
the trimester system helps to ac-
Icomplish that end.
Litchfield said it is possible at
this early stage to make some
! tentative judgments about the im
pact of the trimester plan upon
the faculty at Pitt.
UK SAID 64 per cent of the fac
ulty participated. Incomes of the
instructors, assistant, associate
and full-fledged professors were
increased by roughly one-third.
And non-participating faculty.
I for the most part, found increased
by one-third the amount of time
I they had available for research,
i consulting or related work to
improve the mind or bank balance.
