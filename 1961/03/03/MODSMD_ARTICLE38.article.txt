r The trimester plan for greater
efficiency in higher education is
part of Dr. Edward H. Litchfield's
I "work-for survival" philosophy.
The chancellor of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh said in an in
-1 terview that the competition with
the Soviet Union and Red China
j dictates the need for a new na
tional work habit- on the homo
front, in industry and in the aca
demic world.
Litchfield said that more than
a year ago when Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev was at Pitt,
he threw down the challenge, say
ing—"l warn you, we'll catch up.
we'll wave and we'll pass you."
"THIS, IN' MY terms." Litch
field said, "really is a euphemism
for catch you first and destroy
I you later."
When he talks about work hab
, its, the educator, industrialist and
j former public servant talks in
: the context of competition for sur-
I vival.
, The trimester plan is just the
| beginning.
In addition to efficiencies pos
sible through the plan, Litchfield
said there also is a need for higher
education to undertake a review
1 of lost faculty time.
HE SAID faculty time's lost
when the day's fractured by stu
dents who are unaware of the
| need for times for reflection
among faculty or by a busy fac
| ulty neighbor who drops in as if
! coffee were served every hour or
—by the lack of self-discipline
I among teachers.
Litchfield said the telephone,
problems of commuting, traffic
congestion, noise, confusion and
I short-sighted administration hudg
! et policies also drain faculty time.
The educator said there is a
need to review the work patterns
of undergraduates also.
"WHY such a difference in the
I motives of the undergraduate and
1 the graduate? Why such a differ
-1 ence in the commitment to work,
the willingness to work?
"I would ask the undergradu
ates if they are satisfied and if
they wouldn't gain if they wrung
most of the trivia out of campus
activities,
"I mean the trite and trivial ac
tivities. Can students honestly
I answer the question of whether
they are wasting their capacity
for involvement on matters that
are unworthy of their society?"
"It is immoral for any human
being to fail to use his or her tal
ents to the maximum in life." he
: said.
How should talents be used?
"To make life better for others,"
Litchfield said.

r The trimester plan for greater
efficiency in higher education is
part of Dr. Edward H. Litchfield's
I "work-for survival" philosophy.
The chancellor of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh said in an in
-1 terview that the competition with
the Soviet Union and Red China
j dictates the need for a new na
tional work habit- on the homo
front, in industry and in the aca
demic world.
Litchfield said that more than
a year ago when Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev was at Pitt,
he threw down the challenge, say
ing—"l warn you, we'll catch up.
we'll wave and we'll pass you."
"THIS, IN' MY terms." Litch
field said, "really is a euphemism
for catch you first and destroy
I you later."
When he talks about work hab
, its, the educator, industrialist and
j former public servant talks in
: the context of competition for sur-
I vival.
, The trimester plan is just the
| beginning.
In addition to efficiencies pos
sible through the plan, Litchfield
said there also is a need for higher
education to undertake a review
1 of lost faculty time.
HE SAID faculty time's lost
when the day's fractured by stu
dents who are unaware of the
| need for times for reflection
among faculty or by a busy fac
| ulty neighbor who drops in as if
! coffee were served every hour or
—by the lack of self-discipline
I among teachers.

congestion, noise, confusion and
