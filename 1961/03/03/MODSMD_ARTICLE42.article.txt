# Recession Past Low Mark, Grad Business Students Say
## 
### LINDA RESS 
Cioing into business is like get
ting married, says Prof. William
Spurr of the Graduate School of
' Business. You have to venture a
(forecast for future success based
on what you know about past
history.
Guided by this precept, 24 stu
dents in Spurr's business fore
casting class have spent several
months gazing into the economic
i crystal ball in an attempt to pre
dict the outcome of current busi
j ness trends.
Their assignment: to analyze
the present recession and to pre
dict the level of the gross national
i product for the last quarter of
j 1961.
TIIEIK opinions: The recession
has already passed its lowest
point, and the economy will be on
the upswing in the coming
months. This means that produc
tion will be significantly increased
over last year. In fact, according
to the student investigators, the
i gross national product will be $20
billion greater in the last quarter
of 1961 than in the same period of
1960.
The chief forces that have stim
ulated the business revival, which
is supposed to become evident
this spring, are the measures
' taken by the federal government
to counteract the recession. These
1 include increased defense spend
j ing. social security and unemploy

ment payments, public const ruc
tion, and easing of interest rates.
WHAT EFFECT will all this
have on the personal spending of
American consumers? None at all,
say the forecasters. Consumer ex
penditures will continue to rise at
the present rate of 3.4 per cent a
year.
The class project of analyzing
and predicting the national busi
ness trends was begun last Sep
tember. The two dozen students
were divided into eig t small
groups, each of which submitted
an independent report of its find
ings. They attempted to take into
consideration all pertinent factors
which bear on tho gross national
product.
"Their grades are not dependent
on what they forecast, but how
they forecast," said Spurr., "We
insist on a rational approach to
all predictions, suported by his
torical comparison, together with
the analysis of strategic factors
presently affecting the economv."
THIS RECENTLY completed
project involved only a short
term prediction. With a view to
extending and sharpening their
ability in economic prophecy, the
students are now embarking on a
more ambition s undertaking.
Their goal is to predict the major
business trends for the nexl 10
years.
Spurr stressed I he importance
of accurate forecasting in today's

: complicated business world. Cor
i rect understanding and interpre
tation of business cycles can mean
Ihe difference between success
and failure in many enterprises,
he said. The skill his students are
now developing may contribute
! directly to their success in busi
, ness.
And who knows? It may con
i tribute to thoir success in mar
riage, too. . . .

Cioing into business is like get

Guided by this precept, 24 stu
dents in Spurr's business fore
casting class have spent several
months gazing into the economic
i crystal ball in an attempt to pre
dict the outcome of current busi
j ness trends.
Their assignment: to analyze
the present recession and to pre
dict the level of the gross national
i product for the last quarter of
j 1961.
TIIEIK opinions: The recession
has already passed its lowest
point, and the economy will be on
the upswing in the coming
months. This means that produc
tion will be significantly increased
over last year. In fact, according
to the student investigators, the
i gross national product will be $20
billion greater in the last quarter
of 1961 than in the same period of
1960.
The chief forces that have stim
ulated the business revival, which
is supposed to become evident
this spring, are the measures
' taken by the federal government
to counteract the recession. These
1 include increased defense spend
j ing. social security and unemploy

ment payments, public const ruc
tion, and easing of interest rates.
WHAT EFFECT will all this
have on the personal spending of
American consumers? None at all,
say the forecasters. Consumer ex
penditures will continue to rise at
the present rate of 3.4 per cent a
year.
The class project of analyzing
and predicting the national busi
ness trends was begun last Sep
tember. The two dozen students
were divided into eig t small
groups, each of which submitted
an independent report of its find
ings. They attempted to take into
consideration all pertinent factors
which bear on tho gross national
product.
"Their grades are not dependent
on what they forecast, but how
they forecast," said Spurr., "We
insist on a rational approach to
all predictions, suported by his
torical comparison, together with
the analysis of strategic factors
presently affecting the economv."
THIS RECENTLY completed
project involved only a short
term prediction. With a view to
extending and sharpening their
ability in economic prophecy, the
students are now embarking on a
more ambition s undertaking.
Their goal is to predict the major
business trends for the nexl 10
years.
