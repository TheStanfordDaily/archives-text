# What would YOU do as an engineer at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft?
## 
### 
Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a favor
able engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was design
ing and developing the first of its family of history-making
povverplants, an attitude was born—a recognition that
engineering excellence was the key to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime importance
of technical superiority is still predominant at P&WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge greater.
No longer are the company's requirements confined to
graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering. Pratt & Whitney Aircraft today is concerned
with the development of all forms of flight propulsion
systems for the aerospace medium—air breathing, rocket,
nuclear and other advanced types. Some are entirely new
in concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with degrees in
mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chemical and nuclear
engineering are needed, along with those holding degrees
in physics, chemistry and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engineering
talent provides the best answer. And Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which that talent
can flourish.

officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger, Engineering Department, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, East Hartford 8, Connecticut.


At P&WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear
Engine Laboratory (CANEL) many tech
nical talents are focused on the develop
ment of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this
live mock-up of a reactor, nuclear
scientists and engineers can determine
critical mass, material reactivity coeffi
cients, control effectiveness and other
reactor parameters.


Representative of electronic aids func
tioning for P&WA engineers is this on
site data recording center which can
provide automatically recorded and
computed data simultaneously with the
testing of an engine. This equipment is
capable of recording 1,200 different
values per second.


Development testing of liquid hydrogen-fueled rockets
Is carried out in specially built test stands like this at
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's Florida Research and De
velopment Center. Every phase of an experimental
engine test may be controlled by engineers from a
remote blockhouse (inset), with closed-circuit television
providing a means for visual observation.


Studies of solar energy collection and
liquid and vapor power cycles typify
P&WA's research in advanced space
auxiliary power systems. Analytical and
Experimental Engineers work together in
such programs to establish and test
basic concepts.

P&WA's research in advanced space
auxiliary power systems. Analytical and
Experimental Engineers work together in
such programs to establish and test
basic concepts.

able engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was design
ing and developing the first of its family of history-making
povverplants, an attitude was born—a recognition that
engineering excellence was the key to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime importance
of technical superiority is still predominant at P&WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge greater.
No longer are the company's requirements confined to
graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering. Pratt & Whitney Aircraft today is concerned
with the development of all forms of flight propulsion
systems for the aerospace medium—air breathing, rocket,
nuclear and other advanced types. Some are entirely new
in concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with degrees in
mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chemical and nuclear
engineering are needed, along with those holding degrees
in physics, chemistry and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engineering
talent provides the best answer. And Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which that talent
can flourish.

At P&WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear
Engine Laboratory (CANEL) many tech
nical talents are focused on the develop
ment of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this
live mock-up of a reactor, nuclear
scientists and engineers can determine
critical mass, material reactivity coeffi
cients, control effectiveness and other
reactor parameters.


Representative of electronic aids func
tioning for P&WA engineers is this on
site data recording center which can
provide automatically recorded and
computed data simultaneously with the
testing of an engine. This equipment is
capable of recording 1,200 different
values per second.


Development testing of liquid hydrogen-fueled rockets
Is carried out in specially built test stands like this at
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's Florida Research and De
velopment Center. Every phase of an experimental
engine test may be controlled by engineers from a
remote blockhouse (inset), with closed-circuit television
providing a means for visual observation.
