# Africa Desk Examined By LASSU
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
j llR's Africa Desk program
i came under close scrutiny from
Legislature last night, with
LASSU finally adopting a reso
lution which will cut off the desk's
i operations if a report on its ac
tivities isn't submitted to LASSU
; by next Thursday.
i The motion was passed after
j the group had heard a lengthy re
port on the desk by Its head. Art
I Spiegel. Several members of
LASSU wei-e concerned that the
i desk was continuing efforts to
set up an exchange between Stan
ford and four African universities
without actually having the
! money for the exchange in hand.
SPIEGEL was quizzed on this
j extensively. He answered that he
felt it was necessary for the desk
to present definite programs to
the universities and to groups in
the United Stales from which the
Africa Desk hopes to solicit funds.
He said that the desk expects to
know sometime in the middle of
next quarter whether it will have
the needed funds to set up the stu
dent exchange. He indicated that
the desk is fairly confident of
I gaining the money, since many in
dividuals and groups have ex
pressed definite interest in the
! program.
Several LASSU members re-
I quested specific details on where
I the exchange students would be
housed at Stanford, and who
would foot the bill for tuition and
other expenses.
Spiegel said that these details
were being worked on and that he
would have a complete report to
I Legislature before it meets next
| Thursday.
LEGISLATURE adopted the
resolution calling for a halt in the
desk's operations if the report
! isn't in by then after discarding a
, motion by Off-Campus Repre
j sentative Tom Reilly that all fur
ther activity of the de-sk be halted
I immediately until a written re
j port was turned in to LASSU.
In other matters, the group
| overwhelmingly rejected a re
| quest by the Associated Women
Students for an appropriation of
$185 from the contingency fund
â€¢ for the printing of 2,000 copies of a
! booklet explaining AWS housing
policy and procedure.
It also heard a preliminary re
port from a committee investi
gating the salaries paid students,
in which it was disclosed that stu
dents receive $11,845 a year for
salaries from various campus
I groups.
