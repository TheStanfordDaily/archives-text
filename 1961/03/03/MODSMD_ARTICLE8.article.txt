# Govt. Grants Loan For Fraternities Cluster Program
## 
### 
A $2.25-million building loan
for the construction of two four
unit fraternity clusters has been
granted to Stanford by the Fed
eral Housing and Home Finance
Agency.
Bids will be accepted beginning
April 15, and construction will
start as soon as possible after
that. It is hoped that the first
four-unit building will be ready
for occupancy by next fall.
Phi Delta Theta. Kappa Sigma,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Theta
Delta Chi fraternities will be the
first occupants of the split-level,
frame buildings. Each unit will
hold about 50 students.
BIDS FOR the second unit will
be called for after work has begun
on the first. The second cluster
will house Kappa Alpha, Zeta Psi,

Alpha Delta Phi and Alpha Kappa j
Lambda fraternities.
The loan request for the major |
portion of the $3,086,000 project j
was made a year ago-and'has been j
under consideration by the HHFA, j
a special agency created by for- J
mer President Eisenhower to fi
nance institutional and educa-1
tional housing.
Total cost of each cluster will J
be about $1,500,000. The Univer
sity and the eight individual fra-1
ternities have been responsible I
for raising the difference, $836,-j
000, between the total const rue-1
tion cost and the amount of the '
federal loan.
The first unit will be located J
between the Knoll and Mayfield
Avenue. It will be 11-;l 1 -; stories
high, will be designed with four
living units grouped around a
central kitchen, and will include!
a master residence for a faculty i
member and his family.
THE ARC HITECT is John Carl '
Warneeke and Associates of San ,
Francisco. Landscape architect is
Lawrence Halprin and Associates, i
also of San Francisco.
It is tentatively planned that;
ihe empty fraternity houses will
be occupied by students and fac
ulty for research projects, but
this will depend upon the physical
condition of the buildings. Many
of them fall below present build
ing standards.
The University is also tenta
tively planning to house the Phi t

Gamma Delta fraternity, whose
house was burned to the ground
Aug. 23, in one of the vacated fra
ternity houses in the fall.
Approval of an application to
the HHFA for a second loan to
taling nearly $3 million for addi
tional married student housing on
campus is pending.
