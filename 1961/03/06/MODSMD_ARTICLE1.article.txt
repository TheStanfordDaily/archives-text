# WATER?
## Boathouse Revamped By Frats 
### GREGG HOPKINS 
Refurbished through the efforts
of several Stanford fraternities,
the ASSU and modern chemistry,
the Lagunita boa)house finds it
self all dressed up with no place
to go.
She stands on the steps of the
sometime-watery sanctuary, des
tined to wait in newly-applied
cardinal and white virginity for
the unlikely appearance of her
bridegroom. Rain. The weather
man broke his promise to wed the
twosome in one of the year's most
anticipated ceremonies by provid
ing only two-thirds normal rain
fall this year, as reported in last
Thursday's Daily.
DESPITE the on-and-off rain
fall of the past two days, Lag and
the reservoirs which supply Stan
ford with water remain almost
empty. Unless March and April
bring heavy rainfall, Stanford
may have to institute water ra
tioning, University officials say.
This, of course, leaves the re
vamped boathouse in the position
of almost total uselessnessâ€”ex
cept for sunbathing.
RESPONSIBLE for the refin
ishing of the boat house, underway
since fall, is the boathouse staff
of would-be lifeguards, Steve
Burks, Jim Clyne, Jim Cooper and
Ralph Oilman.
Cooper, who has headed up the
project, reports all external wood
surfaces have been sanded and a
primer coat applied to the struc
ture. "About 200 man-hours have
been put in on the project by
members of several fraternities,"
aaid Cooper.
Phi Delta Theta and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon have contributed
most manpower, said Cooper.
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Zeta
Psi and Phi Kappa Psi members
also have worked on the project.
ONLY THE final coat of paint
is needed to complete what Cooper
thinks is the first refinishing
given the boathouse since its 1939
construction. LASSU provided $1,-
300 for the materials used in the
renovation.
Additional safety measures and
equipment will be provided by
this amount, said Cooper, for use
when Lag next contains water.
Buoys will be painted and a
"Swimming Only" area marked
off between the buoys and boat
house deck. A special channel will
be marked for canoes to reach the
paddling area.
STANDARD lead-base water
proof paint and primer are being
used. Linseed oil will be used to
treat the unpainted deck and the
pilings under the boathouse.
Cooper and Burks spent a day
cleaning vegetation and other de
bris from the pilings.
Outgoing IFC President Sten
Sweeney recently told The Daily
he finds "great encouragement"
in the participation of fraternities.
"We believe fraternities can con
tinue to benefit the campus as a
whole with projects of this sort,"
he said.
And so the boathouse, shining
like new, stares across Lag's dry
bed thinking of past rousing,
carousing spring quarters and
awaiting a wetter, happier one.
