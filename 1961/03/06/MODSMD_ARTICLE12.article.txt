# Memorial Church Remembers Leland
## 
### 
Thursday is a very special day in the life of Stanford University.
If he happened to still be alive, Thursday would be Leland Stan
ford's 137 th birthday. For the last 67 years Stanford has observed
Founder's Day on March 9.
If the thought that this University was founded stirs your heart,
you must wait until next year to do anything about it. The annual
Founder's Day Service took place yesterday morning in Memorial
Church,
Founder's Day is not celebrated on March 9th itself because
the administration discovered that no one came to hear a special
speech. So it was decided that the regular Sunday morning service
in Memorial Church should be combined with the Founder's Day
service. It seems that people have a habit of attending church on
Sunday, no matter what the service may be.
For those of you who missed yesterday's service, here is an
outline of it. The opening hymn was "O God Our Help in Ages
Past." One verse of this hymn is:
"Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away:
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day."
The object of the service was to remember Leland Stanford and his
birthday.
During this hymn there was a colorful diversion. Twenty pro
fessors marched down the center aisle of the church, wearing their
black robes with pink, red, or green hoods.
Then the congregation was put through the usual Order of
Worship: Call to Worship; Prayers; Responsive Reading; Gloria
Patri; and an Anthem.
The First Lesson was read by Marilyn Funk, vice president of
the Senior Class. She read that passage of Deuteronomy which
says "Love the Lord thy God with all thine heart . . . and teach
these words diligently unto thy children." Evidently it was chosen
because it mentioned education.
This was followed by another hymn, and then by the Second
Lesson, read by Martin Parsons, who is president of the Senior
Class. He read Corinthians 3, which says "other foundation can
no men lay than that which is laid, which is lesus Christ." It was
an especially appropriate passage because "foundation" and
"founder" come from the same Latin root.
Next in order was a prayer that this University would continue.
It was also a prayer of gratitudeâ€”gratitude that Stanford Univer
sity was founded. This was followed by a hymn, and then the
dedication of a cross which Mrs. Stanford once owned. Next came
the high point of the church service, the Founder's Day Address.
"Stanford University is a Memorial University," Dr. Thomas
Barclay, professor emeritus of political science, began. Barclay
seemed to be an especially qualified speaker since he is the great
grandson of a personal friend of Leland Stanford.
Barclay told his audience that Senator and Mrs. Stanford had
the funds and the general idea for the founding of the University,
and that William Starr lordan provided the enthusiasm.
In conclusion, Barclay said "Fortunately, Stanford rests on a
solid foundation. We are the proud benefactors of this foundation.
I hope that students today keep the spirit of the old Stanford, as
well as the benefits of the new."
The Founder's Day address was followed by the Act of Re
membrance. Larry Royse and Sandra McCarty, president and vice
president of the ASSU, placed a wreath of palm leaves, red and
white carnations, and white snap dragons, on the altar. They were
assisted, so the program said, by ten class officers.
Earclay explained that his purpose was not to "sermonize or
sentamentalize." He didn't. As a matter of fact, he didn't mention
God. This is as a Founder's Day address should be. It is not as a
Memorial Church service should be.
