## Are Stanford Women Really Different—And If So—Why? 
### 
Are Stanford women really dif
ferent?
If so, how are they different?
And what effect does this dif
ference have on campus social
life?
These are the questions that
arise from the legend that sur
rounds the Stanford women. Al
most everyone who considers ap
plying for admission to the Farm
has this legend brought to his
attention. Young ladies gleefully
anticipate life in the midst of the
Ratio, as visions of booked-up so
cial calendars dance in their heads.
Young men are soon made aware
of the traditional platitude con
cerning Farm females: nine out
of 10 women are beautiful; the
10th one goes to Stanford.
THERE ARE two factors which

contribute to this
tradition, and the
first is easy to
pin down. Stan
ford women are
undeniably defi
cient in one re
spect: quantity.
The fact that
there are 2.1 men
to every woman
has a definite ef
fect on the social
scene.

It all began about three-quar
ters of a century ago, when Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford were mak
ing basic policy decisions. The
senator was all for avoiding fool-

I ishness by excluding women en-
I tirely. But Mrs. Stanford rose to
the cause of her sex, and when
the dust had lifted it had been de
cided to let the females in—with
limitations. The limitations were
specific and to be strictly ob
served: 500 women, and no more,
were to be admitted to the Uni
versity.
Originally the quota posed no
problems, since there were only
about 550 students total. But by
the 1920's the enrollment had
risen above 2,000, and the tradi
tion of the Stanford woman had
been established.
IN THOSE days there was not
so much value placed on well
roundedness as there is today. Ad-
I missions officers were not look
ing for proficiency in office-hold
ing or cheer leading; they were
looking for academic qualifica
tions, and a girl had to survive
rigorous competition to become a
Stanford woman. Of course the
competition for women was great
er than for men. and as a result
the female population were main
ly academically oriented. It is
doubtful that Stanford men will
ever again feel the pain of the
Ratio as they did in the days of
the 500.
In 1933 the Board of Trustees,
under President David Starr Jor
dan. decided that something had
; to give. They eliminated the arbi
trary quota, built Lagunita dormi
i tory and let Ihe dollies flow in.

Since then the ratio of men to
women has been determined by
the accommodations available on
campus.
THAT'S THE story of the Ratio,
the first consideration in the Stan
ford Social Problem. The second
consideration is more difficult to
define.
It doesn't do much good to fret
about the women who aren't here.
But what about the women who
are here? Do the men really have
valid complaints about them?
The deans, who have been in
contact with the students and
their problems over a period of
years, don't seem to think so.
Here are some of their opinions:
DEAN OF Students 11. Donald
Winbigler: "What we see here is
just the traditional war between
the sexes. Nearly all these beefs
are rationalizations of shyness
and lack of confidence."
Dean of Men William Craig:
"This same thing occurs in all
comparable universities; it is
nothing unique to Stanford. I
think it's a tempest in a teapot."
Dean of Women Elva Brown:
"Men at this age are very inter
ested in the approval of others in
their social activities. As a result,
many attractive girls are left un
noticed in the rush to take out
the recognized 'queens.'"
ALL THIS is not to say that no
problem exists. Dean Craig
pointed out that the women are
notably higher than the men in
grade point average. This fact is
undoubtedly related to the com
plaint of many men that the Stan
ford women are overly competi
tive and that this quality is not
socially attractive. Other well
known complaints- that women
become complacent about their
appearance, that they take the at
tentions of the men for granted—
may also be true to some extent.
But the important question that
we will try to answer in coming
articles is whether or not these
phenomena are unique to Stan
ford, or whether the same prob
lem exists at most coed colleges.

view with Hill Kitchen, (he Old
Boy of the Chaparral, who thinks
that Stanford women are deficient
in many respects besides num
bers.)

their problems over a period of
years, don't seem to think so.
Here are some of their opinions:
DEAN OF Students 11. Donald
Winbigler: "What we see here is
just the traditional war between
the sexes. Nearly all these beefs
are rationalizations of shyness
and lack of confidence."
Dean of Men William Craig:
"This same thing occurs in all
comparable universities; it is
nothing unique to Stanford. I
think it's a tempest in a teapot."
Dean of Women Elva Brown:
"Men at this age are very inter
ested in the approval of others in
their social activities. As a result,
many attractive girls are left un
noticed in the rush to take out
the recognized 'queens.'"
ALL THIS is not to say that no
problem exists. Dean Craig
pointed out that the women are
notably higher than the men in
grade point average. This fact is
undoubtedly related to the com
plaint of many men that the Stan
ford women are overly competi
tive and that this quality is not
socially attractive. Other well
known complaints- that women
become complacent about their
appearance, that they take the at
tentions of the men for granted—
may also be true to some extent.
But the important question that
we will try to answer in coming
articles is whether or not these
phenomena are unique to Stan
ford, or whether the same prob
lem exists at most coed colleges.

Are Stanford women really dif
ferent?
If so, how are they different?
And what effect does this dif
ference have on campus social
life?
These are the questions that
arise from the legend that sur
rounds the Stanford women. Al
most everyone who considers ap
plying for admission to the Farm
has this legend brought to his
attention. Young ladies gleefully
anticipate life in the midst of the
Ratio, as visions of booked-up so
cial calendars dance in their heads.
Young men are soon made aware
of the traditional platitude con
cerning Farm females: nine out
of 10 women are beautiful; the
10th one goes to Stanford.
THERE ARE two factors which

contribute to this
tradition, and the
first is easy to
pin down. Stan
ford women are
undeniably defi
cient in one re
spect: quantity.
The fact that
there are 2.1 men
to every woman
has a definite ef
fect on the social
scene.

It all began about three-quar
ters of a century ago, when Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford were mak
ing basic policy decisions. The
senator was all for avoiding fool-

I ishness by excluding women en-
I tirely. But Mrs. Stanford rose to
the cause of her sex, and when
the dust had lifted it had been de
cided to let the females in—with
limitations. The limitations were
specific and to be strictly ob
served: 500 women, and no more,
were to be admitted to the Uni
versity.
Originally the quota posed no
problems, since there were only
about 550 students total. But by
the 1920's the enrollment had
risen above 2,000, and the tradi
tion of the Stanford woman had
been established.
IN THOSE days there was not
so much value placed on well
roundedness as there is today. Ad-
I missions officers were not look
ing for proficiency in office-hold
ing or cheer leading; they were
looking for academic qualifica
tions, and a girl had to survive
rigorous competition to become a
Stanford woman. Of course the
competition for women was great
er than for men. and as a result
the female population were main
ly academically oriented. It is
doubtful that Stanford men will
ever again feel the pain of the
Ratio as they did in the days of
the 500.
In 1933 the Board of Trustees,
under President David Starr Jor
dan. decided that something had
; to give. They eliminated the arbi
trary quota, built Lagunita dormi
i tory and let Ihe dollies flow in.

Since then the ratio of men to
women has been determined by
the accommodations available on
campus.
THAT'S THE story of the Ratio,
the first consideration in the Stan
ford Social Problem. The second
consideration is more difficult to
define.
It doesn't do much good to fret
about the women who aren't here.
But what about the women who
are here? Do the men really have
valid complaints about them?

problems, since there were only
about 550 students total. But by
the 1920's the enrollment had
risen above 2,000, and the tradi
tion of the Stanford woman had
been established.
IN THOSE days there was not
so much value placed on well
roundedness as there is today. Ad-
I missions officers were not look
ing for proficiency in office-hold
ing or cheer leading; they were
looking for academic qualifica
tions, and a girl had to survive
rigorous competition to become a
Stanford woman. Of course the
competition for women was great
er than for men. and as a result
the female population were main
ly academically oriented. It is
doubtful that Stanford men will
ever again feel the pain of the
Ratio as they did in the days of
the 500.
In 1933 the Board of Trustees,
under President David Starr Jor
dan. decided that something had
; to give. They eliminated the arbi
trary quota, built Lagunita dormi
i tory and let Ihe dollies flow in.

Since then the ratio of men to
women has been determined by
the accommodations available on
campus.
THAT'S THE story of the Ratio,
the first consideration in the Stan
ford Social Problem. The second
consideration is more difficult to
define.
It doesn't do much good to fret
about the women who aren't here.
But what about the women who
are here? Do the men really have
valid complaints about them?
The deans, who have been in
contact with the students and
their problems over a period of
years, don't seem to think so.
Here are some of their opinions:
DEAN OF Students 11. Donald
Winbigler: "What we see here is
just the traditional war between
the sexes. Nearly all these beefs
are rationalizations of shyness
and lack of confidence."
Dean of Men William Craig:
"This same thing occurs in all
comparable universities; it is
nothing unique to Stanford. I
think it's a tempest in a teapot."
Dean of Women Elva Brown:
"Men at this age are very inter
ested in the approval of others in
their social activities. As a result,
many attractive girls are left un
noticed in the rush to take out
the recognized 'queens.'"
ALL THIS is not to say that no
problem exists. Dean Craig
pointed out that the women are
notably higher than the men in
grade point average. This fact is
undoubtedly related to the com
plaint of many men that the Stan
ford women are overly competi
tive and that this quality is not
socially attractive. Other well
known complaints- that women
become complacent about their
appearance, that they take the at
tentions of the men for granted—
may also be true to some extent.
But the important question that
we will try to answer in coming
articles is whether or not these
phenomena are unique to Stan
ford, or whether the same prob
lem exists at most coed colleges.

view with Hill Kitchen, (he Old
Boy of the Chaparral, who thinks

in many respects besides num

Are Stanford women really dif
ferent?
If so, how are they different?
And what effect does this dif
ference have on campus social
life?
These are the questions that
arise from the legend that sur
rounds the Stanford women. Al
most everyone who considers ap
plying for admission to the Farm
has this legend brought to his
attention. Young ladies gleefully
anticipate life in the midst of the
Ratio, as visions of booked-up so
cial calendars dance in their heads.
Young men are soon made aware
of the traditional platitude con
cerning Farm females: nine out
of 10 women are beautiful; the
10th one goes to Stanford.
THERE ARE two factors which

contribute to this
tradition, and the
first is easy to
pin down. Stan
ford women are
undeniably defi
cient in one re
spect: quantity.
The fact that
there are 2.1 men
to every woman
has a definite ef
fect on the social
scene.

It all began about three-quar
ters of a century ago, when Sen
ator and Mrs. Stanford were mak
ing basic policy decisions. The
senator was all for avoiding fool-

I ishness by excluding women en-
I tirely. But Mrs. Stanford rose to
the cause of her sex, and when
the dust had lifted it had been de
cided to let the females in—with
limitations. The limitations were
specific and to be strictly ob
served: 500 women, and no more,
were to be admitted to the Uni
versity.
