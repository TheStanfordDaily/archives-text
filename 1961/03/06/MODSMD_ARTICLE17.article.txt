# GARNER 7-0 AND 3-1 WINS
## Card Nine Turns Back USF, Alums in Weekend Twin Bill 
### GLENN ALFORD WARRFN SCHLOAT 
Two Stanford hurlers limited
USF to three hits, while Stanford
batters were rapping out 10 safe
ties to defeat the Dons 7-0 Friday
in Sunken Diamond.
Jim Smith and Marv Mecklen
burg were standouts on the
mound, with Smith particularly
effective, lie didn't give up a hit
in his five-inning stint, while
Mecklenburg gave up only three
in four innings. Combined, the
hurlers struck out 11 and issued
eight free passes.
STANFORD scored four runs
in a big second inning to decide
the game early.
The inning started out with
Rich Ferra/./.ano drawing free
transportation to first and Jim
Cowart singling over the first
baseman's glove down the right
field line to send Ferrazzano to
third. Mike Filice singled off third
baseman Carl Welte's chest to
score Ferrazzano and advance
Cowart to second.
Cowart stole third, and both
runners scored on Joel Schul
man's long triple between the left
and center fielders. Schulman
stole home as USF pitcher Ray
Ware took an exaggerated wind
up.
Stanford scored a single tally
in the third thanks to a misplay
by the USF left fielder. Mike
Magee drove a long fly over the
left fielder's head and up the em
bankment in left field. The har
ried Don tried to throw it from
the top of the bank but rolled
down the small hill when ho lost
his footing. Magee steamed into
third and was credited with a
triple.
CARD left-fielder John Hurlbut
lofted a pop fly into left field that
Gallagher, the USF left fielder,
watched drop five feet in front of
him for a run-scoring single.
Stanford picked up its final two
runs in the sixth inning. Filice
walked, stole second and went to
third on Shulman's third hit of the
game. Both runners scored on
Skip Lawrence's two-out single to
right.
Shortstop Shulman was out
standing both in the field and at
bat. Ilis three hits in three at bats
with two runs batted in and a
triple led the batters, and his de
fensive play kept Smith and Meck
lenburg out of trouble.
