## Bear Ruggers Hand Indians First Setback 
### 
If at first you don't succeed, try, j
J try again. And that's just what j
1 Stanford's rugby team will be do-
I ing when they take on the Cal
j Bears in a rematch next Saturday
after losing a narrow 6-5 decision
to the Blue and Gold before 12,000
in Berkeley's Memorial Stadium
Saturday.
The loss was the first in nine l
contest this season for the Indians
and mar k e d Stanford's 16t h
j straight rugby defeat by the
j Berkeley Bears.
STANFORD started the scoring
a third of the way through the
first half when Kyrk Reid missed
a penalty kick, and, whether or
not the big hooker missed the kick
on purpose or not, the ball sailed
in the waiting hands of break-'
; away Steve Pursell, who fell into
the end zone for the try.
Reid booted the conversion to
give the Cards a 5-0 lead.
But the Tribe rugby men were
never to score again. The closest
i they came to paydirt was in the!
waning moments of the first half,
when Reid started a dribbling
rush that saw John Thomas seem- j
ingly plunge in for the score.
However, the referee's eagle;
t eye apparetly caught an infrac-j
ition; the score was not allowed;
and at half time the score re
mained 5-0 for Stanford.
IN Till'] second half, the power
full Bear scrum exerted itself and
cot rolled the ball .so thoroughly
! that the Indians ever got a chance
to mount an offensive of their
own.
Australian John Harrison final
ly broke the scoring ice for Cal
with a 45-yard penalty kick and
closed the Stanford margin to two
points, 5-3.
Minutes later, the big Aussie
booted his second penalty kick,
this one from 35 yards out, to
sent the Bears home the winners.
In a preliminary contest. Stan
ford's jayvee ruggers suffered
I their first defeat of the year, los
ing to the Bear JV's by a 5-0
, score.
| Herb Foster's try and a conver
sion by Dave Rusk accounted for
jail the scoring.
