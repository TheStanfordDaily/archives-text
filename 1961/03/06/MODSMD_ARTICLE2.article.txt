# UN 						Troops Vacate Crucial Congo Port
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI)—A 120-man Sudanese U.N. con
tingent, outnumbered 6 to 1 by attacking Congolese troops, with
drew from the strategic Congo Atlantic port of Matadi yesterday,
official reports received here said last night.
U.N. officials immediately ordered a Moroccan contingent, esti-

mated at 1,000 men, rushed to I
Matadi from the former Belgian j
base at Kitona.
Details of the latest threat to I
U.N. authority in the dissension-;
; ridden Congo were revealed by I
reliable sources following a two
and a half hour emergency meet-1
ing here of the U.N.'s 18-nation j
Congo advisory committee. It was '
summoned into session by Secre- i
tary-General Dag Hammarskjold. j
THE SUDANESE troops — and
apparently nine Canadian U.N.
signal corpsmen stationed with
them—withdrew from Matadi un
der what formally was described I
as a provisional cease-fire agree- ;
ment, informants said.
Actually the Congolese, num- i
bering some 600 men, gave the
| U.N. forces the choice of getting
' out or being annihilated, the ad
| visory committee was told.
Lt. Gen. Sean Mc-Keon of Ire-;
land, commander of U.N. forces
;in the Congo, was ordered by
Hammarskjold to meet with Con-;
! golcse military leaders today and I
j attempt to restore U.N. authority!
over Matadi by negotiation, if pos
sible.
IT WAS understood that Mc
| Keon would tell the Congolese
I that the U.N. command will not |
j yield to force of arms in any situ- j
' ation. The so-called cease-fire
■ withdrawal agreement apparently
was accepted by the Sudanese
' commander without contact with
McKeon.
It was not known when the Mo
roccan reinforcements would
'reach the Matadi area, but news!
jof their mobilization served to'
! bolster McKeon's hand in his talks
with the Congolese.
Hammarskjold sent a "strong
letter" to Congolese President Jo
seph Kasavubu last night, the,
sources said. The letter demanded '
that the Congo government end
its aggressive actions against the !
U.N. force.
BUT Kasavubu and his premier,
j Joseph Ueo, were understood to j
1 be en route to Tannanarive, Mad-j
j agascar, for a "summit" confer
ence of Congolese political lead
! ers.
i Congolese army chief Maj. Gen.
Joseph D. Mobutu also was re
ported to be away, visiting up
i country area in Equator Prov-!
; ince.
Despite the absence of top Con-j
I golese authorities from the prov-j
| ince, the U.N. advisory committee |
I was of the opinion that the at
tacks on Matadi were "centrally!
i directed," responsible sources
said.
W ITH the forced withdrawal of
j the Sudanese troops, the U.N', was
left without any military force in
j Matadi, the Congo's only major
port and a key point In the supply
i line for the Congo operations.

THE SUDANESE troops — and

der what formally was described I
as a provisional cease-fire agree- ;
ment, informants said.
Actually the Congolese, num- i

| U.N. forces the choice of getting
' out or being annihilated, the ad

;in the Congo, was ordered by
Hammarskjold to meet with Con-;
! golcse military leaders today and I
j attempt to restore U.N. authority!
over Matadi by negotiation, if pos
sible.
IT WAS understood that Mc
| Keon would tell the Congolese
I that the U.N. command will not |
j yield to force of arms in any situ- j
' ation. The so-called cease-fire
■ withdrawal agreement apparently
was accepted by the Sudanese
' commander without contact with
McKeon.
It was not known when the Mo

Hammarskjold sent a "strong
letter" to Congolese President Jo
seph Kasavubu last night, the,
sources said. The letter demanded '
that the Congo government end
its aggressive actions against the !
U.N. force.

I was of the opinion that the at
