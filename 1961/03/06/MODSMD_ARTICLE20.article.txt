Stanford started quickly and
moved to a 6-2 lead on buckets by
John Windsor, John Hendry and
a layin by Mike Ledgerwood, but
j then the Trojans turned on their
power and pulled to a 21-11 bulge
in the first 10 minutes.
The Cards pulled back to within
1 six counters but could never get
i any closer, and a Trojan hot
streak during the last live min
utes of tho half produced a 40-27
; intermission time margin for
coach Forrest Twogood's lads.

AT TIIK halfway mark USCwas
hitting the basket at a 58 per cent
clip, while the Card eagers were
shooting 40 per cent.
In the second stanza, Twogood
cleared his bench as all 12 of the
Trojans saw plenty of action.
USC maintained a 15-point bulge
most of the way until another hot
streak carried it to 20 about two
minutes before the end of the con
test and the final 79-61 score.
Stanford ended up with a shoot-'
ing percentage of 48.1, no mean
feat for any squad, but the inhabi
tants of smogland were even hot
ter, hitting 52.6 per cent.
The Indians were also outre
bounded, managing to recover
only 30 loose balls to the Trojans
44.
