Plenty! Consider tlie problem. Western Elec
tric manufactures the switching systems which
connect some fiO-million Hell telephones
throughout the U. S. The average call over
today s electromechanical system requires 120
relay operations. All together, this intercon
necting equipment makes up the heart of what
is. in effect, the world's largest machine.
That's where Western Electric and i/oii
come in. The switching equipment for this
"machine involves an enormous manufactur
ing job carried on by our plants throughout
the country. Hecause of the size and service
requirements involved, we require quality
standards far exceeding those of ordinary
manufacturing. The size of this job presents
an unusual challenge to the engineer who may
sa\ e the Bell Sv stem many thousands ol dollars
In even a small cost-reduction step.
While today's switching calls for a priority
on engineering, tomorrows will he even more
exciting. For even now the revolutionary Elec
tronic Central Office is under field trial and
promises to remake the world of telephony.
I* 111111 'â€¢ WCstern Electric engineers, working
closclv with (heir counterparts at Bell Tele

phone Laboratories, will concentrate heavily
on developing manufacturing methods for this
ECO equipment.
Yonr Western Electric assignments may
cover many ol our other responsibilities as
the world's leading communications manu
facturer. Perhaps you'll work on advances in
microwave transmission, or even on satellite
communications.
Joining Western Electric may well be your
right connection.

trial, civil and chemical engineers, as well as physical
