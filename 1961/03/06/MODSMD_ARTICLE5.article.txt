# Fire Department Adds II Full-Time Firemen
## New Men Take Over Regular Duties Today 
### FRANCES FISHER 
Assistant Managing' Editor
Twice as many full-time Stanford firemen will jump for the pol
ished pole from now on when the fire horn blasts its nerve-shattering
alarm across the Farm.
The addition of 11 full-time men to the Stanford Fire Department
staff will allow the department to have eight full-time firemen on
duty 24 hours a day, instead of i

the previous four men.
THE II "rookie" firemen ar
rived last week in order to go i
through a training period before!
they began working regular hours j
today.
The staff's expansion was made j
possible by a $65,000 increase in I
the department's budget, bringing
the present annual budget to |
$165,000.
One reason for expansion was
that previously the fire de
partment didn't have sufficient
men to operate its five fire trucks j
properly, according to Assistant;
Fire Chief Frank Julian. How-1
i
ever, Jurian added, "We still do I
not have enough men to be oper-1
ating at maximum efficiency."
ADDITION of the 11 "smoke
eaters" will in no way change the
student firemen's positions. A
force of 12 student firemen pres
ently supplements the full-time
staff. These students live at the
fire house where two study rooms
are provided for them.
Although they do not have to
stay at the fire house at all times,
they are expected to remain on
campus during their shift of duty
and must leave whatever they are
doing when they hear the fire
horn.
Fire Chief John Marston stated,
"The student firemen arc a valu
able asset to the University and
the fire department. If we had
the housing facilities for more j
students, we would like to in
crease their number to a maxi-1
mum of 20."
AN INCREASE in student fire-1
men would cut down the number!
of full-time men needed, although, I
Marston added, "a nucleus of full |
time men is needed, especially for ;
the summer when most students!
leave. These 11 new men will be j
very helpful this summer."
Jurian explained that a disad
vantage to the full-time men is I
that they do not live on campus. I
Some live as far away as San
Jose; consequently, the depart-1
ment cannot depend on a reserve
of available men in case of ex
treme emergencies. "The student :
firemen are especially valuable
because they live at the fire
house," Jurian stated.
ANOTHER AID to the fire de
partment will be the new aerial
ladder fire truck which is expect
ed to arrive in three weeks. The
$50,000 truck has an 85-foot hv
draulically powered ladder which
can be operated by one man. Such
a ladder operated by manpower
would take six skilled firemen to
handle.
The teritory covered by the fire
department includes all Univer
sity lands except those areas with
in city limits.
Out of the University's 9,2001
acres, the department is respon-1
sible for approximately ' 7,000
acres.
WITHIN THIS 7,000 acres are
buildings worth an estimated $85 |
million and a population of ap
proximately 20,000 people. "Be-;
cause of the high value of build
ings in the territory, it is espe
cially necessary to have adequate 1
fire protection." Marston said.
Concerning the future, Marston J
hopes that the Ford grant will
allow the fire department to have
a "badly needed" new building.
He estimated the cost of the new
building If* tie between $200,000
and $250,000. I

Fire Chief John Marston stated,
"The student firemen arc a valu
able asset to the University and
the fire department. If we had
the housing facilities for more j
students, we would like to in
crease their number to a maxi-1
mum of 20."
AN INCREASE in student fire-1
men would cut down the number!
of full-time men needed, although, I
Marston added, "a nucleus of full |
time men is needed, especially for ;
the summer when most students!
leave. These 11 new men will be j
very helpful this summer."
Jurian explained that a disad
vantage to the full-time men is I
that they do not live on campus. I
Some live as far away as San
Jose; consequently, the depart-1
ment cannot depend on a reserve
of available men in case of ex
treme emergencies. "The student :
firemen are especially valuable
because they live at the fire
house," Jurian stated.
ANOTHER AID to the fire de
partment will be the new aerial
ladder fire truck which is expect
ed to arrive in three weeks. The
$50,000 truck has an 85-foot hv
draulically powered ladder which
can be operated by one man. Such
a ladder operated by manpower
would take six skilled firemen to
handle.
The teritory covered by the fire
department includes all Univer
sity lands except those areas with
in city limits.
Out of the University's 9,2001
acres, the department is respon-1
sible for approximately ' 7,000
acres.
WITHIN THIS 7,000 acres are
buildings worth an estimated $85 |
million and a population of ap
proximately 20,000 people. "Be-;
cause of the high value of build
ings in the territory, it is espe
cially necessary to have adequate 1
fire protection." Marston said.
Concerning the future, Marston J
hopes that the Ford grant will
allow the fire department to have
a "badly needed" new building.
He estimated the cost of the new
building If* tie between $200,000
and $250,000. I

Twice as many full-time Stanford firemen will jump for the pol
ished pole from now on when the fire horn blasts its nerve-shattering
alarm across the Farm.
The addition of 11 full-time men to the Stanford Fire Department
staff will allow the department to have eight full-time firemen on
duty 24 hours a day, instead of i

the previous four men.
THE II "rookie" firemen ar
rived last week in order to go i
through a training period before!
they began working regular hours j
today.
The staff's expansion was made j
possible by a $65,000 increase in I
the department's budget, bringing
the present annual budget to |
$165,000.
One reason for expansion was
that previously the fire de
partment didn't have sufficient
men to operate its five fire trucks j
properly, according to Assistant;
Fire Chief Frank Julian. How-1
i
ever, Jurian added, "We still do I
not have enough men to be oper-1
ating at maximum efficiency."
ADDITION of the 11 "smoke
eaters" will in no way change the
student firemen's positions. A
force of 12 student firemen pres
ently supplements the full-time
staff. These students live at the
fire house where two study rooms
are provided for them.
Although they do not have to
stay at the fire house at all times,
they are expected to remain on
campus during their shift of duty
and must leave whatever they are
doing when they hear the fire
horn.
