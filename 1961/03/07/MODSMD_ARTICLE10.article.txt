## UN 						Troops Slow Down Operations 
### 
LEOPOLD YTLLE (U P I) —
Choosing discretion over valor,
the U.N. command yesterday or
dered its angry soldiers to stand
fast: and refused the natural im
pulse to storm t lie Congolese-held
city of Matadi in order to prevent
a general war with Congolese
troops.
As the situation grew more
tense, the U.S. Navy in Washing
ton ordered a task force of four
ships, carying 500 combat-ready
U.S. Marines, to skip a scheduled
visit to Capetown, South Africa,
and head for Congo waters to
stand by.
UNITED Nation officials sought
political settlements both here, at
the U.N. World Headquarters in
New York, and at a Congolese
"summit" conference opening in
Madagascar today.
But the Sudanese and Canadian
contingents to the U.N. troop
force were spoiling for a fight
since rampaging Congolese sol
diers, outnumbering a Sudanese-
Canadian garison 6-1, forced them
out of the Atlantic port city of
Matadi Sunday.
THE survivors of the 120-man
Sudanese detachment and eight of
the nine Canadians in Matadi ar
rived back in Leopoldville with
out their arms.
The Sudanese suffered 2 killed,
4 badly wounded, 9 slightly
wounded and 12 missing in the
two-day fight at Matadi.
The Canadian Signal Corps de
tachment of 9 men lost one man—
a Capt. Bellinger, the detachment
commander who walked out in a
hail of machine gun bullets to
try to get the Congolese to cease
fire. He was missing and pre
sumed dead.
THREE Canadians were slight
ly wounded when shellfire fom
Congolese 20 mm. anti-aircraft
batteries shattered their villa.
A 1,000-man force of' Moroccan
ti'oops started for Matadi Sunday
but was abruptly halted. The
main Congo army base at Thys
ville, backed by Belgian officers,
threatened 1o send 2,000 more
Congolese to Matadi if the U.N.
sent in reinforcements.
This would have widened the
battle, possibly triggering a gen
eral U.N.-Congolcse conflagration.
