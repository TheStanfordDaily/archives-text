# Moral Behavior Should Govern
## 
### 
During Bachelor Week last week the bravado of the fraternity
men finally reached Wilbur Hall. As the Branner women serenaded,
the men of the Wilbur houses they were treated to numerous acts
of indecent exposure along with the usual water balloons and hol
lered obscenities.
A few water balloons may be chalked up to college fun. But
the obscenities, both vocal and physical, are hard to explain among '
a well-educated male population. Perhaps the men involved got
a certain sense of masculine boldness by their acts of exhibitionism.
Perhaps they received a certain satisfaction from shocking the fresh
man women.
It is doubtful, however, that this satisfaction or boldness was
very long-lived, for it is not the type that comes from performing
either feats of physical skill or from accomplishing a difficult intel- j
lectual problem. Rather it is a feeling of short-lived elation followed
by a basic loss of self-respect.
Hopefully, too, these men in the future will also be more aware j
of treating women with due respect. There has been much talk
recently about Stanford woman's failure to respect the Stanford
man. Yet Stanford men, in performing such lewd acts, have not
shown themselves worthy of their respect. A sense of moral be
havior should help.
The Wilbur judicial council has on its docket two of the many
who happened to get caught. We urge the council to impress upon J
them the seriousness of their offense.
