## JFK National Resource Program Seen as Investment, Not Expense 
### 
After the message on education,
which is concerned with people,
we had a message last week on
the conservation and development
of our natural resources. It is con
cerned with the lands and the
forests of America, with the min
erals and fuels beneath them, with
the air and with the water, the
river valleys, and the oceans.
The message itself does not
contain a legislative program. It
is rather a kind of ordered sum
mary and panorama of what in
the years ahead needs doing about j
our natural enviornment.
THERE IS almost no one, I
imagine, who would care to argue :

that the objec
tives laid down
are false ones,
and that the ac
tions indicated
should not be
taken. No seri
ous person, for
example, won 1 d
say that there is
(no water prob
hem, particularly
in the West. Or

say that a planned, rather than
a haphazard and helter-skelter, de
velopment of the great river val
leys, is a wrong thing to do. Or
say that the polution of the
streams and of the air is not
worth worrying about. Or that
the erosion of the soil and the de
struction of the forests do not
concern us. And so and so on.
from research in the de-salting of
the sea water to the setting aside
of recreation areas.
Nor will there be many to deny.
I think, that the conservation of
our natural resources is a pri
mary interest of the nation as a
whole, an acknowledged national
interest since the founding of the
Republic. The states have a great
and essentia] role to play. But the
leadership, the planning, and the
coordination can come only from
the federal government. The
boundaries of the states do not
coincide with the boundaries of
nature.

THIS IS in no sense an innova
tion by President Kennedy on the
new frontiers. It has been estab
lished American policy since the
states on the Atlantic Ocean began
to break through the old frontiers.
The real problem posed by the
message is not about the national
interest, or about the constitu
tional principle of federal leader
ship. It is how such large and
varied measures are to be fi
nanced. Over the years the con
servation of our natural resources
I will cost a great deal of money.
The President's message refers
to this problem and says that
! "wise investment in a resource
! program today will return vast
dividends tomorrow, and failure
to act now may be opportunities
! lost forever." But since the mes
| sage is a map of the country that
: is to be travelled over and is not
| an inventory of specific measures
| to be taken, it does not discuss the
I financial support of the programs
; which are still to come.
BY THE TIME these programs
jcome into effect, the Administra
tion expects, so I understand, not
only to have overcome the pres
ent recession. It expects also, say
in about two years, to be achiev
ing a higher rate of growth—to
achieve it by reducing unemploy
ment from over 6 per cent of the
labor force to about 4 per cent.—
which would be non-inflationary
"full employment." At this higher
rate of economic activity, the
wealth produced this year would
be some $40 billion greater than
it is. The revenues from this in
crease at present tax rates would
be an additional $10 billion. This
woidd be ample to finance
strengthening of the national de
fense, aid to education, the re
sources program, and the welfare
I measures.
We cannot, of course, be sure
that these expectations will be ful
i filled. If they are not, the esscn
! tial needs, defense, education, and
| the like, will have to be financed
by higher taxes. But with good
I luck, particularly in preventing

a much greater international
crisis than we now have today, it
is quite within the capacity of the
American economy to support a
rising standard of public and of
private consumption. We have the
labor, the industrial skill, the
management, the know-how, and
the research to do it.
BUT ALONG with all that,
there will have to go a certain re
education of American public
opinion. More exactly, the re-edu
cation will mean the clearing
away of the confusion which clus
ters about the highly charged
words "spending" and "invest
ment."
Thyere is, for example, the no
tion that the public authorities at
any government level never in
vest. They only spend. On the
other hand, private corporations
and private individuals not only
spend but also invest. This leads
! to the blind prejudice that since
governments can only spend,
whatever private corporations or
individuals invest, that is a good
thing and a public benefit.
This prejudicial use of words
confuses public opinion. The
money spent privately to make
automobiles is prudent invest
ment. But the money spent pub
licly to build the roads for the
automobile's is spending. The
money to build a public hospital
is spending. But the money to
build plants to make the drugs
that are dispensed is investment.
If a public park is made, that is
spending. If a new movie house
is built, that is investment.
THIS SEMANTIC muddle in
hibits clear thinking about pub
lic questions. The truth is that
there is private spending and
private investment and some of it
is good and some is not so good
and some of it is bad. There is
also public spending and public
investment, and some of it is good
and some of it is not so good and
I some of it is bad.
It takes good judgment to spend
land invest wisely, be it publicly
! or privately. But that kind of
judgment cannot be made at all
; if we react, like Pavlov's dogs, to
I the prejudiced sound of words.
