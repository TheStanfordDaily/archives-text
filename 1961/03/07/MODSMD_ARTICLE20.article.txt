### Ken Dery 
Never having been impressed with national college rankings I
was nevertheless stunned last week when the United Press Inter
national's basketball ratings came over the teletype. Niagara, cur
rently sporting a 15-4 record, was in a tie for the 21st position with
a grand total of 4 points.
Thirty-five coaches form ITPI's rating board and they vote on a
basis of 10 for their first place selection, 9 for their second choice
and so on down the line. Publicity and favoritism play a great part
in these weekly selections, but this slight to the Purple Eagles bor
dered on the outrageous.
TIIE PREVIOUS SATURDAY night at Olean. N.Y., everyone was
ready to celebrate St. Bonaventure's 100 th consecutive home basket
ball victory. The party never took place.
Alumni and friends had come from great distances to see their
wonderous Bonnies t,he country's second-ranked outfit win at
the Olean Armory. St. Bonaventure teams had not failed their fol
lowers for 13 years through 99 games. «
But Niagara, the last team to beat the Bonnies in the armory,
whipped Tom Stith and co. 87-77, for one of the season's major up
sets. John (Taps) Gallagher called the victory "My greatest in 30
years of coaching at Niagara."
IN ADDITION TO St. Bonaventure, Niagara numbers La Salle,
Duquesne, Holy Cross, Fordham and Seton Hall among its victims.
The Purple Eagles from upstate New York accepted a bid to the Na
tional Invitational Tournament a few days after the thrilling upset.
Maybe the UPI needs a new board of selectors.
A Bid for Tennessee State?
While Niagara had accepted a bid to the NIT and was smarting
under the dearth of ranking points a small university in Nashville
found itself in the exact reciprocal situation.
Tennesse A. and I. State University last week was named the
finest small college team in the nation. The Tigers completed their
season with 24 victories in 2S games. Utopia for Tennessee State
would he a bid to the NIT, but as of yesterday that bid had not come
and it was generally conceded that either Holy Cross or Duquesne
would fill the only remaining uncommitted spot. One of the remain
ing three open berths is being reserved for the runner-up in the Sky
line Conference (either Utah or Colorado State). Another is expected
to go to Bradley, Missouri Valley Conference runner-up.
IN AN ATTEMPT TO help the tournament's selection commit
tee Harold Hunter, the A. and I. coach, journeyed to New York
last week.
Hunter pointed out that his team had won the National Associa
tion of Intercollegiate Athletics championship for three years in a
row. a record. In an interview with the New York Times the coach
praised his all-Negro team to the sky. In a way, it was a plea against
what appears to be a common belief: That the only exportable prod
ucts of A. and I. are a runner named Wilma Rudolph and a broad
jumper named Ralph Boston,
"Could A. and I. win the NIT?
"If we played our normal game," Hunter said, "nobody would
beat us."
"NORMAL" FOR HIS team, the coach said, was a ."0 per cent
shooting average from the floor.
"On some nights," he said, "we've hit on 75 per cent of our shots.
We've scored as many as 86 points in a half."
Would A. and I. do as well in faster competition?
"The only thing holding us back," said Hunter, "is that we are
tabbed as a small college.
"I'LL GIVE YOU my honest opinion. I've seen Bradley and Ohio
State play. You take those teams and put them in a playground with
us, and my material will win just as many as theirs."
If there is some question whether A. and I. could win in big
time competition, there seems no disagreement that of college basket
ball's fast-breaking team. Tennessee State is the fastest.
"A few times they put the clock on lis coming down court,"
Hunter said matter-of-factly. "On the average we kept the ball seven
seconds before we shot."
However, Huntei said, his attack is as intricately planned as the
next coach's.
"It's just thai we don't spend any time messin' around."

wonderous Bonnies t,he country's second-ranked outfit win at
the Olean Armory. St. Bonaventure teams had not failed their fol
lowers for 13 years through 99 games. «
But Niagara, the last team to beat the Bonnies in the armory,
whipped Tom Stith and co. 87-77, for one of the season's major up
sets. John (Taps) Gallagher called the victory "My greatest in 30
years of coaching at Niagara."
IN ADDITION TO St. Bonaventure, Niagara numbers La Salle,
Duquesne, Holy Cross, Fordham and Seton Hall among its victims.
The Purple Eagles from upstate New York accepted a bid to the Na
tional Invitational Tournament a few days after the thrilling upset.
Maybe the UPI needs a new board of selectors.
A Bid for Tennessee State?
While Niagara had accepted a bid to the NIT and was smarting
under the dearth of ranking points a small university in Nashville
found itself in the exact reciprocal situation.
Tennesse A. and I. State University last week was named the
finest small college team in the nation. The Tigers completed their
season with 24 victories in 2S games. Utopia for Tennessee State
would he a bid to the NIT, but as of yesterday that bid had not come
and it was generally conceded that either Holy Cross or Duquesne
would fill the only remaining uncommitted spot. One of the remain
ing three open berths is being reserved for the runner-up in the Sky
line Conference (either Utah or Colorado State). Another is expected
to go to Bradley, Missouri Valley Conference runner-up.
IN AN ATTEMPT TO help the tournament's selection commit
tee Harold Hunter, the A. and I. coach, journeyed to New York
last week.
Hunter pointed out that his team had won the National Associa
tion of Intercollegiate Athletics championship for three years in a
row. a record. In an interview with the New York Times the coach
praised his all-Negro team to the sky. In a way, it was a plea against
what appears to be a common belief: That the only exportable prod
ucts of A. and I. are a runner named Wilma Rudolph and a broad
jumper named Ralph Boston,
"Could A. and I. win the NIT?
"If we played our normal game," Hunter said, "nobody would
beat us."
"NORMAL" FOR HIS team, the coach said, was a ."0 per cent
shooting average from the floor.
"On some nights," he said, "we've hit on 75 per cent of our shots.
We've scored as many as 86 points in a half."
Would A. and I. do as well in faster competition?
"The only thing holding us back," said Hunter, "is that we are
tabbed as a small college.
"I'LL GIVE YOU my honest opinion. I've seen Bradley and Ohio
State play. You take those teams and put them in a playground with
us, and my material will win just as many as theirs."
If there is some question whether A. and I. could win in big
time competition, there seems no disagreement that of college basket
ball's fast-breaking team. Tennessee State is the fastest.
"A few times they put the clock on lis coming down court,"
Hunter said matter-of-factly. "On the average we kept the ball seven
seconds before we shot."
However, Huntei said, his attack is as intricately planned as the
next coach's.
"It's just thai we don't spend any time messin' around."
