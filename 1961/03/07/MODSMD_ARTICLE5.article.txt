## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPIi Young
I men accepted by President Ken
j nedy's peace corps probably will
1 be given draft deferments for t lie
i length of their peace corps duty,
Selective Service Chief Gen. Lewis
I B. Hershey said yesterday.
1 Barring some new military
I crisis, he added, they probably
will be able to get further defer
ments after completing their
peace corps assignments if they
remain in some work or study "in
i the national interest."
HERSHEY said this was not a
I flat commitment, but merely his
estimate of the course selective
service probably would follow.
The President has emphasized
that peace corps volunteers will
not be entitled to automatic draft
deferments. During the election
campaign, there had been some
talk of making it a substitute for
military service.
Hershey made his statement to
! a reporter after peace corps direc
j tor Sargent Shriver told a news
I conference the draft chief had em
j phasized to him that there would
be no automatic draft exemption.
SHRIVER agreed with Hershey
that a volunteer would have to do
useful work to get a further de
ferment after his two-year hitch
in the peace corps.
Shriver said 10 or 12 countries
in Africa. Asia and Latin America
| already have informally expressed
interest in having peace corps con
tingents sent to them. The peace
corps office, he added, received
between 3.500 and 4,500 inquiries
about membership today alone.
SHRIVER also said a nucleus
; of a career planning board has
j been appointed to help peace corps
j members get jobs after their serv
ice is completed.
He said the first four members
| of the board are Joseph Beirne,
a vice president of the AFL-CIO;
Roger Jones, assistant secertary
of state for administration; Dr.
Benjamin Willis, Chicago school
superintendent, and Ralph Laz
arus, president of the Federated
Department Stores.
Shriver gave these other details
on how the peace corps will work:
"MEMBERS will live at the
standard of living as people of the
j same profession in the country to
I which they are sent. They will
I not. however, have to live at the
: level of the poorest people in such
! countries.
"Peace corps members will be
under the control of the U.S. am
bassador in the country they work
in. There will be no peace corps
ranks. All will be simply mem
bers.
"Married couples may join the
corps together if both qualify."

Shriver gave these other details
on how the peace corps will work:
"MEMBERS will live at the
standard of living as people of the
j same profession in the country to
I which they are sent. They will
I not. however, have to live at the
: level of the poorest people in such
! countries.
"Peace corps members will be
under the control of the U.S. am
bassador in the country they work
in. There will be no peace corps
ranks. All will be simply mem

"Married couples may join the
corps together if both qualify."
WASHINGTON (UPIi Young
I men accepted by President Ken
j nedy's peace corps probably will
1 be given draft deferments for t lie
i length of their peace corps duty,
Selective Service Chief Gen. Lewis
I B. Hershey said yesterday.
1 Barring some new military
I crisis, he added, they probably
will be able to get further defer
ments after completing their
peace corps assignments if they
remain in some work or study "in
i the national interest."
HERSHEY said this was not a
I flat commitment, but merely his
estimate of the course selective
service probably would follow.
The President has emphasized
that peace corps volunteers will
not be entitled to automatic draft
deferments. During the election
campaign, there had been some
talk of making it a substitute for
military service.
Hershey made his statement to
! a reporter after peace corps direc
j tor Sargent Shriver told a news
I conference the draft chief had em
j phasized to him that there would
be no automatic draft exemption.
SHRIVER agreed with Hershey
that a volunteer would have to do
useful work to get a further de
ferment after his two-year hitch
in the peace corps.
Shriver said 10 or 12 countries
in Africa. Asia and Latin America
| already have informally expressed
interest in having peace corps con
tingents sent to them. The peace
corps office, he added, received
between 3.500 and 4,500 inquiries
about membership today alone.
