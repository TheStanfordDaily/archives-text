## Stanford Doctor Heals Natives 
### 
A Stanford Mcdical School graduate laboring
to hcli) the afflicted in his nalivo Kenya has been
a much needed financial shot in (he arm by the
Stanford International Relief Organization.
A check for $631 has been sent on its way to
Dr. Mungai Njoroge, a 1957 graduate of the School
of Medicine, who operates a clinic in the large vil
lage of Thika, 30 miles from Nairobi. Kenya.
THE MONEY was taken from a SIRO fund
idle for more lhan a decade, after Legislature gave
its approval to ihe move last month.
Njoroge is only the second native doctor in
Kenya, and is the first trained in the United States.
His outpatient clinic (there are no inpatients tie
cause of lack of facilities) serves the 300 natives
who come to him each day. seeking medical aid.
In his small. MEDICO-rented building, Njoroge
and his seven assistants have treated thousands of
patients. From November, 1939, when he opened
the clinic, to July, 1960, he personally treated 10,.
22S new cases and 21.916 returning cases.
NJOKOCiE's story is one of determination from
the start.
He arrived at Stanford during the fall of 1952
with 25 cents in his pockets, having made the
journey from Africa to California independently.
At the Farm, he supported himself and with the
aid of a scholarship succeeded within live vears

iii becoming a doctor. During these years he also
served as two-time president of the International
Club and made local talks to raise money for two
years of residency and internship in New York.
His story was so dramatic that lie was featured
on the "This Is Your Life" television program.
(CAMPUS GROUPS wishing to show the film
can obtain it by contacting the SIRO Desk at the
1111 Shack.)
Friends of Njoroge believe that lie may be
drawn into politics when his country becomes in
dependent, since the need for political leadership
from the few educated people will be intensified.
He already has flown to Britain in a political
capacity.
In the meantime, his greatest concern is his
clinic. He also hopes to build a hospital and has
MKDICO's backing.
SIRO POINTS out that while no organized
drive is being conducted to aid Njoroge, anyone
interested in helping his efforts is welcome to make
out a check to the Institute of International Rela
tions and mail or deliver it to the SIRO Desk at
the lIR Shack.
Meanwhile, the doctor continues treating Iho
constant flow of natives who stream into his clinic
on foot from 200 miles around many of them 1o
wait a day or so before Njoroge can treat them.
