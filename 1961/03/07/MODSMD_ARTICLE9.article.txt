# Peace Corps Asks Aid From IIR Africa Desk
## Kennedy Wants Outline Of African Research 
### 
President Kennedy's Peace Corps yesterday asked the Africa
Desk of Stanford's Institute of International Relations for a written
report outlining the desk's contacts in Africa and the research it
currently is engaged in.
Art Spiegel, head of the desk, talked by telephone with Albert

Simms. head of tiie University di-1
vision of the Peace Corps in j
Washington.
WHEN informed of the wide-J
ranging activities of the Africa
Desk, Simms asked Spiegel to for
ward to him as soon as possible a
report detailing the desk's pro
gram and extensive list of impor
| tant contacts among Africans and i
; their governments.
One of the top concerns of the
; Peace Corps is the need in Africa
| for teachers of all subjects, and
i the possibility that the corps could
j help fill this need.
Spiegel noted that Simms ex
j pressed surprise at the extensive
| program underway at Stanford
j concerning Africa.
Spiegel also announced that the
1 African-American Institute has
j asked Stanford to furnish 45
| French-speaking teachers to
j Guinea next year.
HE SAID any seniors and grad
uate students interested in the
program, and anyone else inter
ested in any Peace Corps program
in Africa, should attend an Afri
can Desk-sponsored meeting at
5 p.m. today at the Women's Club
house.
The Guinea government has
asked the United States for teach
ers of English, natural science,
chemistry, mathematics and phys
ics because while it has more
than 200 Communist teachers,
there are almost no Western
teachers in the country.
The Africa Desk, Spiegel said,
will try to give a summer pro
gram of intensive study in
French, background of Guinea
history and instruction in teaching
methods to prepare members of
the delegation.
THE African-American Insti
tute is a privately endowed group
in New York and Washington
which arranges teacher placement
in Africa. It needs 75 persons for
the current program, but 30 have
signed up. It came to Stanford in
an attempt to land the other 45.
In addition, the Columbia pro
gram, which is similar, has asked
| Stanford to nominate students for
teaching positions in East Africa,
Spiegel said.
j This program includes a year's
preparation in Makerere College,
J Uganda, for members of the 150-
j man delegation.
He said those who can meet
[qualifications should have no|
> problem getting placed.
STANFORD also is presently!
negotiating in conjunction with
; Yaleâ€”with the governments of
j Ghana and West Nigeria in an
attempt to get those nations to
! allow Stanford to nominate stu
! dents for teaching positions in the
! two countries.
The Africa Desk, in addition, |
now is involved in a fund cam
paign 1o raise money to establish i
an exchange program between j
Stanford and four African univer
sities. Enough groups and indi
viduals have expressed interest in
j getting funds for the exchange
will be a jazz concert Spiegel
hopes to stage soon. He.says a'
; number of top names in the jazz I
world have indicated a willingnes >
!to perform without charge and j
urges any student interested in j
i helping on that part of the pro
gram to contact him at the lIR |
i Shack immediately.
