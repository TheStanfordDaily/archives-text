# Conant Proposes Exam for All Grad School Candidates
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Dr. James Bryan Conant, distinguished American educator, ex
plained his "radical proposal for graduate level education in the
United States" to a capacity audience in Memorial Auditorium last
night.
"I suggest," the past president of Harvard said, "that the graduate

schools of arts and sciences of the
United States require that all can
didates for admission pass a writ
ten examination.
"The requirements might in
! elude," Conant continued, "read
; ing, writing and speaking knowl
i edge of at least one foreign lan
guage, a knowledge of mathemat
ics through calculus, knowledge
of physics, chemistry, and biology
at the freshman college level, and
| a knowledge of English and Amer
| ican literature, history, and po
i litical institutions at a sophisti
j cated level."
CON A NT'S remark that mini
mum requirements for admission
to graduate schools ought also to
include "the ability to write the
English language" was applauded
by his audience.
i "What we emphasize in a lib
| eral education is provided in the
pre-university schools on the con
| tinent." Conant declared. "Out-
I side the United States, the univer
; sity does not concern itself with
j liberal education."
The past United States high
i commissioner to Germany said
that "the German university is es
sentially a collection of profes
; sional faculties. It is comparable
: to postgraduate work in the Unit
ed States, both in kinds of learn
ing and in numbers involved.
"At the age of 12, 20 per cent
of the students in Germany are
enrolled in pre-university schools,"
Conant said. He explained that
students study math, science, and
literature intensively and take
several stiff five-hour examina
tions. Only 5 per cent of the Ger
man young people enter a uni
versity.
"THE WHOLE idea of giving
degrees is foreign to German uni
versities," Conant continued.
! "They do give certificates, but the
American preoccupation with
! bachelor degrees is something else
! again."
Conant described the education
system in Great Britain as one of
"intense early specialization." He
informed his audience that Brit
ish students must choose their
j specialization when they are 15,
in order to compete for admission
to British universities. One rea
j son competition is high is that 85
; per cent of university students re
| ceive full scholarships.
"IN KK(>AK1) to their abilities
when they have completed their
education, our students would
stack up with students any
where," "Conant assured his lis
| toners.
One possible result of the ac
ceptance of his proposal would lie
a shortening of the time spent in
college, Conant stated in an ear
lier press conference. "A college
diploma would not be necessary
for admission to graduate school.
However, the student would have
to have gone through the matur
ing process of college, Conant. ex
plained.
Another result would be the
"toughening of high school stand
ards." Conant lamented that "In
certain high schools guidance of
ficers must find colleges to take
students whose ability doesn't
measure up to their parents' am
bition."
CONANT, whom President Wal
lale Sterling described as "a
spokesman for educational prob
lems," concluded his talk by tell
ing his audience what he would
say if they were entirely an audi
ence of professional men who
| had the habit of speaking out
1 about standards of American ed
; ucation.
"If you agree with what I have
said, put the pressure on your
school administration and deans,"
| Conant told his imagined audi
ence. "If you reject my proposal,
from here on 1 beg you to hold
your peace."
