# ATO's Ousted from National—-Go Local
## SU Charter Lifted for Pledging of Four Jews 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
Stanford's chapter of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity had its national
charter lifted yesterday for pledging four Jewish students.
The local Beta Psi chapter immediately announced it would con
tinue to pledge as a local fraternity and declared "there is no change
at all in our rushing plans" for spring quarter.

The ouster was ordered by the |
fraternity's five-man high coun
cil at a meeting yesterday in Chi- 1
i c.-ago. It followed a closed hearing !
| held in Palo Alto Jan. 28 at which
national officers charged the Uni
versity chapter with violating the
ATO national constitution.
HOUSE President Mike Kava
naugh said the move was ex
pected. "We feel that this is some
thing that was inevitable, almost,"
he explained.
A new name for the fraternity,
which was established at the
same time Stanford's first classes
met in .1891, will be chosen at
a house meeting tonight.
Kavanaugh added "everyone is
very optimistic about our chances
in the future" as a local fraternity
with no national affiliation.
"We intend to conduct ourselves
as we have in the past as a Stan
ford fraternity dedicated to the
pledging of those members who
we think will make good ATO's.
"PLEDGING starts . . . April 1.
and under (yesterday's) ruling we
will pledge as a local fraternity.
"We have had almost unani
mous support from our alumni
and feel that this will continue. Be
cause of this support we are opti
mistic about our future at Stan
ford," he said.
Stanford President W a 11 a c e
Sterling voiced his backing of the
house, saying the University "will
give the chapter every possible
encouragement" in its plans to
remain active as a local.
"We are proud of the way the
Stanford students of the ATO
chapter have defended their prin
ciples in a trying situation," he
; continued.
"IF THE Stanford chapter . . .
must discriminate against mem
bers of the Jewish faith in order
to keep its national charter in
force, the chapter has no choice
but to give up its charter.
"The University's stated policy
against discriminatory practices
would require such action.
"I am gratified, however, that
the Stanford chapter members are
in accord with this view. The
chapter is leaving the national I
... on its own initiative out of re
spect for the personal convictions
of its members and the Univer
sity's policy."
In taking its action, the high
council declared the chapter's ac
tion in pledging the three sopho
mores and one junior—all Jews—
i in last spring's rush violates the
organization's constitution which
I "requires allegiance to Christian
i ity, just as a man must be a medi
i cal student to join a medical fra
j ternity."
IT ADDED in a statement:
"Our Stanford chapter . . . vio
! lated this constitutional provision
and declared that it would con
; tinue to do so. Under the circum
! stances, the chapter leaves the fra
ternity no alternative but to place
! its charter in escrow."
The council said its unanimous
i action was based on a hearing
held at Rickey's Studio Inn last j
month. At that time, more than
! LOO active ATO's and alumni of
I the local chapter presented their
j case before H. J. Garrecht, chair- j
; man of the high council. ATO has j
i accepted Jewish members for 10 j
I to 15 years, Kavanaugh said.
The council said yesterday (hat j
(religious bias did not influence
its decision.
"The constitution of our fra
ternity was adopted by democratic
action of all our chapters," Gar
! recht said. "We have chapters in
: 119 colleges and universities
I throughout the United States, and
one in Canada. They determine
| our membership policies.
"THE VERY nature of our rit
ual requires allegiance to Chris
tianity, just as a man must be a
medical student to join a medical
fraternity."
Support for the ATO stand is

| sued from several student and ad
i ministration leaders, and from
| Franklin H. Williams, California
assistant attorney-general, who
said in San Francisco:
"We think the revocation is a
disgraceful act in this enlightened
day and we shall take immediate
steps to ascertain whether any
ATO chapters are recognized on
any public campuses in this state,
and if they are, we shall request
withdrawal of such recognition."
DEAN OF Students H. Donald
Winbigler praised the ATO's for
their stand and noted "I can as
sure them the University is ready
to back them and give them en
couragement."
He felt the loss of the national
charter would not cause freshmen
to pass up the house during rush
ing. The loss "won't have a nega
tive effect it should have a posi
tive effect" he said.
"I don't think the national name
and tic mean that much to Stan
ford fraternity men," he added.
Dean of Men William G. Craig
also supported the house, and de
clared "My estimate is that the
freshmen will respect the house
and the position they took and the
ATO's will be in a very favorable
position with our present fresh
men."
HE POINTED out that other
fraternities have lost their charter
and gone local with no drop in
status.
He held that the ATO's "will
gain considerable amount of re
spect from the students and the
faculty" for their action.
Bob Friese, freshman class pres
ident. said the freshmen will re
act in one of two ways: they will
either "really get behind ATO" or
they will "value the national
status enough not to get behind it.
"1 would say they'll got behind
the local chapter," was his per
sonal opinion.
"I DON'T think they'll be hurt"
by the move, and "ATO might
• have a special appeal" to fresh
men now, since it would be unique
in being the only local fraternity
on campus, Freise ventured.
Outgoing Inter - Fraternity
Council President Stendcr Swee
ney reported last night that the
IFC constitution will be altered
at the group's next meeting so
that the ATO's will be on an
"equal footing" with the other 23
Farm fraternities.
The IFC previously agreed to
the changes if the house lost its
charter, and Sweeney expects no
trouble in changing the constitu
tion to take care of the ATO sit
uation.
