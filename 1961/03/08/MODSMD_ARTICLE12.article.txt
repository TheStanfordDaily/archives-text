# Booklist Sales Replace Debate on Chastity As Current AWS Fund Raising Project
## 
### 
The editorial on the merits of having a debate on Chastity sponsored by the Association of Women
Students was geared to such a low level of thinking and taste that it should exclude the Stanford Stu
dent Body. Your obscure point that people will attend a debate on a "sensation" topic but will not turn
out for a worthwhile discussion of the American Press could certainly be made in a much more so
phisticated manner. By using sensationalism in your editorial, you employed the very thing you

criticized and again lowered the
prestige of your column.
As for putting AWS on the
chopping block by associating its
activities with a campus-wide cir
cus (the subject could bo dis
cussed legitimately) which would
be a well-attended money-raiser,
The Daily could have operated in
a more beneficial way by helping
to publicize a current project for
raising scholarship funds.
This week AWS is selling a
booklist for 35 cents containing
book titles suggested by the de
partment heads of Stanford Uni
versity. The purpose of the col
lection is to give students and pro
fessors an up to date, highly selec
tive but basic reading list cover
ing many fields. This group of
books should be worthwhile for
the campus and alumni as a guide
to reading material on a wide
range of subjects. (Air Science to
Classics.)
We are hoping that this type of
project will meet with success.
