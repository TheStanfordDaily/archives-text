Once again, Mr. Parker, you
have thrust on my over-burdened
shoulders, the very, unpleasant
onus of lambasting you with the
vitriol iif my pen. I am refering,
of course, to your humor column
of Friday, March 3rd, which, due
to reasons absolutely beyond my
ken, appeared as an editorial in
the Stanford Daily. So allow me
to enlighten and educate you a
little, since it appears, we are all
stuck with you for a full year,
however much some of us may
dislike it.
1) Mr. Rajeshwar Dayal repre
sents, neither Mr. Nehru, nor the
official Indian policy vis-a-viz the
Congo. He" represents Mr. Ham
marskjold and the United Nations.
2) Opposition to the U.N. poli
cies and forces in the Congo comes
mainly from Kasavubu and his
"Rightist-oriented clique" (to
copy your own language) supplied
with equipment and munitions
from the Western bloc, and not
from Gizenga and his "Leftist
oriented clique," as you have
stated. You could have got, at
least this information straight,
had you bothered to read 'a' news
paper, any newspaper, even one of
the rags or scandal sheets pub
lished in California.
3) The .success of the United
Nations lies in the cooperation ex
tended it, by the member nations
and in the acceptance of its de
cisions and judgments at all times
—not. just when in your favor. I
might remind you that this very
same Mr. Hammarskjold, repre
senting this very same United
Nations, was dubbed "incompe
tent," not very long ago, in his
judgment of the crisis in Lebanon.
Heaven forbid, but it seems to me
you wish 1o destroy Communism,
nay, just Soviet Russia and Red
China (for Tito is your ally), by
employing Iheir evil ways and
iheir dirty tactics—may be, a little
more efficiently, what?
If you keep this up, you will
surely net a Grand Award from
the American Legion, but by
golly, what a price for America
and the Human (or should I have
said Inhuman) race, to pay!
