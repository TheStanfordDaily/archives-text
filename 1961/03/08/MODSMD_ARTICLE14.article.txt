In view of the recent headline
article about the new fraternity
houses, and because of ensuing in
terest in these new houses, it
seems worthwhile to add the fol
lowing to the information already
printed.
The first houses, which are to
be completed next year, are indi
vidual houses. They are more
than 100 feet apart, and this is
farther than many adjacent fra
ternities are now.
Perhaps it should also be men
tioned that the new houses will
be on different levels of ground,
and that the landscaping and lo
cation of trees is such that each
house will be hidden from view of 1
the others.
