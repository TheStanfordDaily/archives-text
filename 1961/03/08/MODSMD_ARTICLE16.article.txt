# Worst Reception
## 
### 
In connection with their pro
gram for Bachelor Week, the
freshman women from Branner
Hall just: finished serenading the
Wilbur Hall freshman. A group
of approximately fifty girls
stopped and sang songs in each
of the four courtyards at Wilbur.
As a reward for their work and
interest, the girls were received
with cat-calls, hurled obsenities,
and a few water balloons. Al
though this was by far the worst
reception given any group of
women in the vicinity of Wilbur

is generally greeted in similar
fashion.
It is a commonly known fact
that most Stanford men do not
think too highly of Stanford wo
men. This is mostly due to the
fact that Stanford men expect to
be honored, revered, and respected
and to have their bloated little
egos fed by the women. When
this does not. happen, Stanford
men get all upset and blame the
lack of respect on the part of the
women on the "obvious poor qual
ity of Stanford women."
Just how do Stanford men ex
pect to be honored, revered, and
respected by the women if they
do not themselves respect these
women in return? One must give
respect in order to receive it. The
typical show put on by the men
in Wilbur tonight is one hell of a
fine way to show respect. If the
Stanford men would start to show
Stanford women the respect that
they deserve, they would find that
Stanford women can be pretty
fine women after all.
