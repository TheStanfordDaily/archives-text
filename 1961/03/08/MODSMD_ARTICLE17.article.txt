# Meade of Branner

Miss Linda Hess, who recently
martyred herself in an attack on
Stanford men, is taking on more
than she can handle.
Opening with a barrage aimed
at Stanford's "sometime" humor
magazine, she says: "Chappie has
taken to heart that old saw, 'When
all else fails, try sex.' " Perhaps
Miss Hess is r.ol aware that sex
is an interesting topicâ€”the Daily
obviously is, even though Miss
Hess says that the newspaper is
"interested in objective, enlight
ened analysis." Why else would
she be given three columns to ex
plain Stanford and San Jose sex?
Why else would it publish, as I
remember recently, a jolly article
on strip-teasing? And why, please
answer this one, would it ever
allow Miss Hess to write a series
on her campus sex issue.
Incidentally, I got a kick out of
Miss Hess's journalistic shrewd
ness. The sting of her observa
tion that the Chappie's use of the
word "outstanding" was left up
to the reader's imagination had
hardly worn off when she let
loose with one of her own: "Pre
conceived prejudices." That takes
a lot of imagination.
Then, in one smutty passage,
her sbur grapes of wrath show
through: "Stanford women have
known about (what Stanford men
want) for a long time. Maybe
that's why they are so wary of
Stanford men." The Margaret
Meade of Branner Hall has spo
ken.
One of the things that Stanford
men don't want, Miss Hess, is to
bo told what they want.
