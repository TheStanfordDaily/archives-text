On the subject of federal aid to
education, some views to counter
act those of Messrs. Lippmann
and Rankin deserve mention.
First, "a new standard of excel
lence in education—and the avail
ability of such excellence to all
who are willing and able to pur
sue it," can neither be bought nor
legislated; the implication that
pouring money into the schools
via a dramatic 'crash program'
will improve the quality of their
teaching is unwarranted.
The Federal Government, in
providing aid, could not avoid
some influence as to how that
aid is used, if only to the extent
of saying that it will be used for
one purpose and not for another;
and the farther the source of con
trol is removed from the schools,
the less responsive will they be to
local needs. The increasingly prev
alent tendency to say, "This prob
lem is too big to handle on a local
level, let's pass it off onto Uncle
Sam." is a dangerous one: each
time people evade their individual
responsibility and give control to
the Federal Government, they
are sacrificing a measure of their
freedom—freedom which is di
minishing all too rapidly.
"We think the time is past when
local communities and states can
carry the burden of education by
themselves. Federal aid is going
to be necessary from now on—un
less citizens wash to burden them
selves with increasingly heavy
tax rates." Mr. Rankin implies
that if education is paid for local
ly it costs the citizens money,
whereas if the Federal Govern
ment pays for it, it is free (this
same reasoning is used for Presi
dent Kennedy's health plan, inci
dentally). Some elementary book
keeping tells me that a given
amount of money spent on educa
tion will cost: the citizenry a given
amount of money, regardless of
whether they pay it in the form of
local taxes or federal taxes; but
the 'something for nothing' phi
losophy dies awfully hard.
