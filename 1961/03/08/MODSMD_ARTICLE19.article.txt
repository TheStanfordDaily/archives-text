When I read Mr. Rankin's col
umn today on Federal Aid to Edu
cation, I thought to myself, "That
was a great column; I should
write him a letter of congratula
tion."
So I sat down to compose a
letter.
First I thought of writing,
"That was a great column, and
though I don't agree with what
you say, I will defend to the death
your right to say it."
Then I thought, "That's a little
strong. Perhaps I should say that
I will defend to the finish your
right to say it."
But I thought some more and
decided that that was the same
thing, only to a different degree.
Then it hit me!:
"That was a great column and
though I don't agree with what
you say, I will defend until chal
lenged your right to say it." More
peace-loving, unilateral disarma
ment and all that.
Then I challenged myself, and I
stopped defending your column
and started thinking about it, and
I thought 1o myself, "That was a
great column, but did he have a
right to say those things?"
That is why I am writing you
now. I would like to say that
your column today was very glib
and fine sounding, but I would
like to know just who you think
you are trying to tell us how to
educate our children and live our
personal lives?
