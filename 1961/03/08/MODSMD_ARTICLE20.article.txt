# More on Housing

I noted in Miss Strelitz's arti
cle (in the Daily) regarding
"Negro Ghettos in Northern
Cities" that she heaps praise upon
President Kennedy lor nomi
nating a Negro as director of the
nation's housing program. From
this fact she quickly jumps to the
conclusion that federally enforced
integrated housing may soon be
forthcoming. I support her view
that integrated housing and
schools are means for achieving a
more democratic U.S. I am not so
optimistic, however, about the
present administration's ability to
spearhead such integration
through its legisaltive proposals.
A case in point is the recent $5.6
billion five-year plan for federal
aid to education: as a "bow to the
South, whose support seems es
sential to legislative enactment,
the President made no mention
in his message of restricting fed
eral education funds to spending
on integrated schools or those
that are obeying Supreme Court
desegragation order s." I Wall
Street Journal, 21 Feb.) It would
seem from this that there shall
always be some obstacles to fed
eral legislative action.
Instead of sitting back and
waiting for JKF, Mi*. Weaver, or
Congress to "do something" about
our local ("Northern") city prob
lems, might we not take the prob
lems to our slate capitals (that's
where many of the problems used
to be solved before FDR!) for ac
tion? In California, such a bill is
now pending in the State Legisla
ture: AB 801, a "Fair Housing"
bill. Anyone believing in the still
(somewhat)-existent states' rights
and who would like more informa
tion about this bill can write to
the following person for a copy
of same: Mr. Frank Quinn, r ,<
C.C.U., 437 Market St.. San Fran
cisco 5.
A letter to one's sfale represent
ative may bring action much soon
er than fine to Washington."The
next move is yours . . not

desegragation order s." I Wall
Street Journal, 21 Feb.) It would
seem from this that there shall
always be some obstacles to fed
eral legislative action.
Instead of sitting back and
waiting for JKF, Mi*. Weaver, or
Congress to "do something" about
our local ("Northern") city prob
lems, might we not take the prob
lems to our slate capitals (that's
where many of the problems used
to be solved before FDR!) for ac
tion? In California, such a bill is
now pending in the State Legisla
ture: AB 801, a "Fair Housing"
bill. Anyone believing in the still
(somewhat)-existent states' rights
and who would like more informa
tion about this bill can write to
the following person for a copy
of same: Mr. Frank Quinn, r ,<
C.C.U., 437 Market St.. San Fran
cisco 5.
A letter to one's sfale represent
ative may bring action much soon
er than fine to Washington."The
next move is yours . . not
! Mr. Weaver's.
