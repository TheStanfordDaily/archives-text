## Medical Bill Fulfills JFK Campaign Promise 
### 
President Kennedy's announce
ment" that he wants Congress to
provide more than $1 billion a
year in medical aid to the elderly
through the Social Security sys
tem is an attempt to live up to the j
Democratic platform pledge: "We
shall provide medical care bene
fits for the aged as part of the
time-tested Social Security insur
ance system."
Thitry-three nations now fur
nish medical care for the elderly
on a national basis. The U.S. will
bo the 34th only if very strong op-!
position is overcome. The main !
opposition comes from the Amer-;
ican Medical Association, insur
ance companies, The Wall Street j
Journal and many Republicans |
who fear that government assist
ance to the elderly is socialistic.
President Eisenhower called a i
geriatrics conference in January
at which he stated: "I have been j
against compulsory insurance as;
a very definite step in socialized j
medicine." He avoided stating his }
posilion on medical care, but most
people felt that he was clearly op- j
posed to using Social Security ap
paratus to help the elderly.
Our senior citizens live on next
to nothing. Their median income
is about $966; only fifteen per cent
have incomes over $2,000, four per
cent over $5,000 and less than one
per cent $10,000 or more.
But the elderly do not want fed

eral assistance, it is argued. A re
port by two sociologists, J. W.
Wiggins and H. Schoenck of Em
ory University indicated that the
elderly are able and willing to
| finance their own medical care
and emphatically don't want fed
eral "interference." This report
delighted the AMA and the Wall
Street Journal. But nine of the
sixteen members of the Wiggins-
Schoenck project withdrew their
support of the project saying that
the report had passed the point
! of credulity.
SENATOR Pat McNamara's (D.
] Mich.) Subcommittee on Problems
of the Aged and Aging report dis
| credits the Wiggins-Schoenck find
ings. More than one-third of the
I aged have no "nest egg or liquid
I assets" of any kind. Forty per
i cent of the elderly over sixty-five
i have some form of hospital insur
ance, but the coverage is rather
j limited and benefits are usually
: inadequate for prolonged or serj
j ous illness. Overall, only 21 per
i cent of the elderly with incomes
of $1,200 or less (a category which
j constitutes a majority of all the
aged) have any hospital insur
ance.
The Eisenhower Administration
hoped that commercial insurance
companies would fill the need of
the elderly. This still is a possi
bility, however a recent study
enumerated some 1,200 organiza
tions in the health-insurance field,

of which only 288 have provisions
for persons sixty-five or over.
The need for federal action is
now clear to most Democrats and
many Republicans. Rut ihc oppo
sition is adamant and vociferous
and is lead by the omnipotent
A MA.
C ONSERVATIVES as well as
insurance companies continue to
oppose the Social Security plan.
What is to prevent the govern
ment from expanding its activi
ties say to provide medical care
fore everyone? The Wall Street
Journal says that "each step on

the welfare road can be considered
'logical' only if we are prepared to
go the whole journey." There
seems to he no justification for
assuming this. Other age groups
do not need medical assistance as
much as the elderly. Also, it is
rather odd that insurance com
panies do not welcome govern
ment insurance for the elderly
since it delivers them for a very
unpleasant and unprofitable task.
The fight in the Congress will
lie long and bitter, but logic seems
to favor a victory for proponents
of the proposed legislation.
