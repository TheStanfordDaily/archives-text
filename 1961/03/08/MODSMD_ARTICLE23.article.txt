## Recession Continues Despite JFK Proposals 
### 
There is as yet no evidence, un
less it be in the behavior of the
stock market, that recovery from
the recession is underway or in
sight. Unemployment is continu
ing to increase, steel is operating
at half capacity, the automobile I
business is very poor. All in all [
there is a growing disposition to j
ask whether the extremely mod- i
erate measures proposed by the i
President will be sufficient to
turn the tide.
The President's task force, |
which was headed by Professor j
Paul Samuelson, the president of
the American Economic Associa
tion, advised Mr. Kennedy in Jan
uary that the first measures
might not be adequate, and that

if the upturn did
not come by
April, stronger
measures would
be needed.
PROFESSOR
Samuelson does
not hold any pub
lic office. But in
many ways he is
the economist to
whom the Ad
ministration

economists listen most closely. He
has just written an article for a
Japanese newspaper the "Nihon
Keizai Shimbun." The article dis
cusses the Kennedy program as it
has been formulated to date. Pro
fessor Samuelson thinks that
"when you come to add up in
quantitative terms what the whole
package of programs can be ex
pected to accomplish, you rea
lize how limited the total package
really is."
IT IS A FAIR inference from
Professor Samuelson's article in
the Japanese newspaper that he is
now rather expecting that a sup
plementary package will be
needed.
These ideas stem from the be
lief that the present recession, fol
lowing upon a poor recovery from
the recession of 1958, and coming
at the end of several years of
sluggish economic activity, is
much more serious than Congress
or the mass of the people who are
not unemployed have yet realized.
What is more, a quickening of
economic growth to the American
average rate of 3'a to 4 per cenl,
"will have to wait until the second
and third years of President Ken
nedy's term of office."
THESE ARK hard judgments of
a cool and expert mind. They will
be unwelcome to many. They will
be unwelcome to those who take
the view that with words of confi
dence and optimism a recession
like this one can be talked away,
and that the somber truths should
be glossed over and suppressed.
The more innocent among them
go so far as to say that this re
cession and this slowdown are
being prolonged, indeed made
worse, because the Kennedy ad
ministration is telling the country
that the economy is very sick.
There is everything to be said
for keeping up the confidence of
a sick patient. But an essential in
gredient of that confidence is that
the patient be convinced that the
doctor is not deceiving himself.
If, as seems so probably, we face
a long hard effort to revive the
American economy, the confi
dence of the people will best be
sustained by convincing them that
the economic doctors are not
treating nice words as a substi
tute for real actions.
