# Mural Program Has Long History
## 
### JOCK McBAINE 
Chuck Taylor, Stanford's Assistant Director of Athletics, has nothing but praise for the University's
intramural program. Taylor, a former football great at Stanford, is a devoted advocate of physical con
ditioning.
He feels that all students should have some exposure to a conditioning program and that the intra
mural competition is a step in the right direction.

Taylor sees a future need for
indoor facilities to enlarge the
scope of the present program and
permit the inclusion of such
sports as handball and badminton.
THE AIMIABLE Taylor was in
charge of the intramural program
for a short time prior to 1950. He
then joined the 49'ers coaching
staff and was succeeded by Elwyn
Bugge, the present director of in
tramurals.
Taylor later returned to Stanford
as head football coach and then
moved into the position he now
holds in the Department of Ath
letics.
Today Bugge has an assistant.
Bill Glennon picks and supervises
all of the student officials. This
is an important phase of the pro
gram for the three main sports
touch football, basketball and soft
ball all are played under these
officials.
Bugge, who graduated from
Stanford in the Class of 1926, re
calls that in tram ura Is were going
strongly in 1922 under the guid
ance of Charlie Davisi now with
the Oakland City Park Depart
ment). But no one is quite sure
exactly when in tram urals started
on the Farm. It is likely that var
sity athletics on the intercollegiate
level were an outgrowth of a
thriving intramural program.
WHKN DAVIS gave up his post,
the program was run under a sys
tem of student directorship and
with the advice of a physical edu
cation instructor. Harry YVolter,
the baseball director, was chair
man of the intramural program at
that time.
This plan lasted 10 years and
with the coming of the war. the
program was altered to provide
physical conditioning for the army
units stationed here.
In 1946. with the enrollment
growing again, the present pro
gram was initiated. Since lhat
time, bowling, basketball free
throws and gymnastics have been
added to the schedule.
UNDER THE present system,

the University championship has
changed hands often. Beta Biz
won the overall title in 1956 to be
followed by Alpha Biz in 1957. Re
cent winners were Beta Biz in
1958, Delta Upsilon'in 1959 and
Sigma Chi in 1960.
The intramural program has
obviously achieved one of its main
goals: to provide enjoyable and in
formal exercise for students. How
ever. a question arises as to
whether the present rules of eligi
bility are in line with the aims of
the program.
Director Bugge feels that the in
tramural program exists to bone
fit the athletes who are not of the
varsity caliber. This principle
must be viewed in the light of the
fact that in past years such names
as Phil Toorvald. Jerry Winters,
Ben Robinson, John Brodie and
Dick Norman have been found in
the scorebooks for intramural
football and basketball.
DOES THIS benefit the athletes
who are not of the varsitv caliber

—say, for example, a team known
as the Rocks which lost two bas
ketball games by scores of 50-6
and 79-8? The answer is probably
yes because the intramural pro
gram is driven more by a desire to
have fun than to win the cham
pionship.

Chuck Taylor, Stanford's Assistant Director of Athletics, has nothing but praise for the University's
intramural program. Taylor, a former football great at Stanford, is a devoted advocate of physical con
ditioning.
He feels that all students should have some exposure to a conditioning program and that the intra
mural competition is a step in the right direction.

Taylor sees a future need for
indoor facilities to enlarge the
scope of the present program and
permit the inclusion of such
sports as handball and badminton.
THE AIMIABLE Taylor was in
charge of the intramural program
for a short time prior to 1950. He
then joined the 49'ers coaching
staff and was succeeded by Elwyn
Bugge, the present director of in
tramurals.
Taylor later returned to Stanford
as head football coach and then
moved into the position he now
holds in the Department of Ath
letics.
Today Bugge has an assistant.
Bill Glennon picks and supervises
all of the student officials. This
is an important phase of the pro
gram for the three main sports
touch football, basketball and soft
ball all are played under these
officials.
Bugge, who graduated from
Stanford in the Class of 1926, re
calls that in tram ura Is were going
strongly in 1922 under the guid
ance of Charlie Davisi now with
the Oakland City Park Depart
ment). But no one is quite sure
exactly when in tram urals started
on the Farm. It is likely that var
sity athletics on the intercollegiate
level were an outgrowth of a
thriving intramural program.
WHKN DAVIS gave up his post,
the program was run under a sys
tem of student directorship and
with the advice of a physical edu
cation instructor. Harry YVolter,
the baseball director, was chair
man of the intramural program at
that time.
This plan lasted 10 years and
with the coming of the war. the
program was altered to provide
physical conditioning for the army
units stationed here.
In 1946. with the enrollment
growing again, the present pro
gram was initiated. Since lhat
time, bowling, basketball free
throws and gymnastics have been
added to the schedule.
UNDER THE present system,

the University championship has
changed hands often. Beta Biz
won the overall title in 1956 to be
followed by Alpha Biz in 1957. Re
cent winners were Beta Biz in
1958, Delta Upsilon'in 1959 and
Sigma Chi in 1960.
The intramural program has
obviously achieved one of its main
goals: to provide enjoyable and in
formal exercise for students. How
ever. a question arises as to
whether the present rules of eligi
bility are in line with the aims of
the program.
Director Bugge feels that the in
tramural program exists to bone
fit the athletes who are not of the
varsity caliber. This principle
must be viewed in the light of the
fact that in past years such names
as Phil Toorvald. Jerry Winters,
Ben Robinson, John Brodie and
Dick Norman have been found in
