# Negroes Score Sit-in Victory As Atlanta Agrees to Integrate
## 
### 
ATLANTA (UPI) Major Atlanta department and variety stores
agreed yesterday to gradually desegregate their eating facilities.
Sit-in leaders and the city's merchants reached the agreement
after months of demonstrations at downtown stores that had a policy
of segregated eating places.

No (leadline for a start toward
desegregation of the facilities was
announced except that it would
begin at the time the city's schools
are desegregated. This is sched
uled to begin next fall.
Although the eating facilities
will be reopened for the present
on a segregated basis, yesterday's
action appeared to be a major vic
tory for the Negro groups press
ing for full desegregation.
Attorney General Eugene Cook
said the state would be "helpless"
to enforce its new anti trespass
lavs - under which Negro sit-in
ners have been arrested by the
store if management of stores
refuse to cooperate or if they "vol
untarily submit to racial integra
tion."
The Atlanta Chamber of Com
merce, which a n no un ce d the
agreement, said the IT stores and
chains representing approximate
ly 50 individual stores would gear
their desegregation to the admis
sion of the first Negroes to white
public schools here.
During the sit-ins, picketing and
boycott at department and variety
stores that had segregated eating
places, many downtown stores
closed tea rooms, snack bars and
lunch counters.
