# ATO Brothers Accept Action, Voice Opinions
## 
### GREGG HOPKINS 
The atmosphere at the ATO
House yesterday was studiedly
casual but in a forced sort of way.
Instead of the usual unconcern
for strangers typical of a fra
ternity. yisitors were greeted with
alert questioning glances from the
groups seated in the living room
playing cards before dinner.
"Losing the charter doesn't
mean that much to me." said
junior John Smith. "The national,
to me. is only a name." Jack Ben
nett concurred: "I'm glad we did
it this wayâ€”l'd rather lose the
charter than change tlie way we
acted."
Graduate Michael J. St. Clair
was proud of lii.s undergrad broth
ers. "We're still strong on cam
pus." he said. "I think the campus
opinion supports us in taking this
stand."
A sophomore who preferred to
remain anonymous expressed the
feelings of many in the fraternity,
"We'll continue strong, despite the
national's action. I think it's bet
ter to be disassociated from that
group of organized bigots, any
way."
So the comments ran among
Stanford ATOs yesterday. They
had expected the action, and
though sorry it had to come, were
accepting it as the only possible
way their house could live up to
its beliefs.
