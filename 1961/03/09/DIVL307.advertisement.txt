Bright idea with a glowing future
At Gen Tel, research is put to work to advance
communications through sight as well as sound.
The dial of our compact Starlite* phone, for
example, utilizes an entirely new source of light
that marks a milestone in visual communications.
Called Panelescent^ : (electroluminescent) lighting,
it produces light without heat, has no bulb to turn
on and off, and costs less than 1£ a year for
electricity.
Pioneered and developed by the Lighting Products
Division of our subsidiary, Sylvania, this dramatic
new light opens up almost infinite product possi
bilities in sight communication. Already it is being
\ used for clock faces, radio dials, auto instrument
'"<A Mwi panels and road signs.
