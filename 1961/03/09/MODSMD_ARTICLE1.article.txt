# Librarians 'Appalled' by Misuse of Stacks
## Judicial Council Asks Student Cooperation As Library Thefts and Violations Increase 
### FRANCES FISHER 
Assistant Managing Editor
Problems of forgery, theft and ;
mutilation are plaguing the Li
brary, intensifying the many i
problems of managing the un
wieldy library facilities.
The end-of-the-quarter pressure
to obtain certain books seems to
have overshadowed many people's
sense of honesty.
In the past three weeks three
students have been caught check
ing out books with a forged stu
dent body card. These Honor Code j
violations have come before Judi- J
cial Council and have been treated i
severely.
"In the future such Honor Code ;
violations will be treated with j
equal severity and can easily re-;
suit in suspension from the Uni- i
versity," stated Eric Blitz, chair-1
man of Judicial Council.
THEFT of books has been prev- j
alent in the library. Since inven-!
Tories are taken at the end of the ;
quarter, the most recent facts ap
ply to 1960. After the 1960 inven
tory, 391 books were reported 1

missing. English books seem to
be a particularly popular item, as
the entire 16-volume set of "The
Cambridge History of English
Literature" and the 19-volume set
of "College English" have disap
peared.
In order to try to recover some
of their books, t lie library staff,
searching through only the open
rooms of fraternity houses after
spring quarter last year, found
137 books.
The fraternities are not the only j
guilty ones. Last December IIS j
books were found in one women's]
Row house.
SOME students' ideas of "bor- j
rowing" at the library appear to
be a little distorted. One of the i
most serious problems of the de->
partmental libraries is in the dis-l
appearance of books and journals
for short periods of time especi
ally when the books are required
reading for a course.
Mutilation of periodicals is
abundant. The Current Periodicals |
Desk receives reports each week ;

of articles cut or torn from one
to 20 bound volumes. Although
some of the articles can be re
placed, the process inflicts a need
less strain on the already strained
library budget, and causes great
inconvenience for others needing
to use the articles.
Blitz, as chairman of Judicial
Council, asked for "the coopera
tion of all the students in keeping
the library privileges which we
now have."
"The use of the library is a
privilege. The use of the stacks
for study is a greater privilege.
It is a well-known fact that there
are many ways to 'beat' the li
brary system. However, this does
not mean that it must be done,"
Blitz continued.
"Stanford operates on a spirit
of integrity, and this extends to
the use of books in the library as
well as to the taking of an exam
ination in the classroom. When
this spirit is broken, the system
fails."
