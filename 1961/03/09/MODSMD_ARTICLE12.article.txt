# Intellectuals Lack Interest in Conant
## 
### 
Our writer covering Dr. Conant's address Tuesday in Memorial
Auditorium reported a "capacity audience." This information was
somewhat misleading. True, the hall was filled. But on a campus
of more than 8,000 students one would expect this audience to con
tain a majority of students. However, officials of the Committee on
Public Exercises estimate that students made up only from twenty
five to thirty per cent of the audience. The remainder was composed
of University faculty and staff plus little old ladies from Palo Alto.
All this makes us wonder about the new "intellectualism" among
today's college student. Certainly Dr. Conant's reputation, as Har
vard University President, as Ambassador to Germany and as per
haps the foremost commentator on American education today, should
be enough to draw students from their living groups, even during
the week before Dead Week. The few students who came heard
both a knowledgeable and entertaining talk on an important and
much-discussed phase of American education â€”the "learned pro
fessions."
For the vast majority who stayed away, we can only judge that
they did not care. Following the poor attendance of both a talk by
Dr. Sterling last spring to the senior class and this January's panel
talk on Stanford education, it seems that this newly found "intellec
tualism" apparently doesn't extend to the discussion of education.
