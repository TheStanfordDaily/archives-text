Faith and Learning
Thank you for an editorial
which points to a need (Monday,
March 6>. The ambiguities of the
Founder's Day Service are mani
festations of the general ambig
uity at Stanford University con
cerning the relations of the com
munity of learning and the com
munity of faith—the university
and the church. The extent of this
ambiguity need not continue.
There are people here, as mem
bers of (either or) both commu
nities, eager to enter and sustain
the rigorous dialogue which is so
essential for the growth and
health of both.
I would suggest that an indis
pensible starting point (in order
not to waste each others time
with more ambiguities) for stu
dents, faculty, and administration
is Ihe thoughts which that good
man of both Ihe university and
the faith, Alexander Miller, left
us in his book, "Faith and Learn
ing."

The alphabetized authors of
last Thursday's lelter discussing
the Fundamental Standard spoke
about the need of enlightening the
Stanford student in regard to the
necessary "cooperative responsi
bility between him and society."
When this responsibility has been
recognized, the freshmen feel the
Fundamental Standard will work
(which they intimate is "not work
ing as it should"). The problem
has been stated; now let's get
practical. The real issue lies in
the lack of adequate education.
No one will recognize their re
sponsibility unless first Ihey
clearly understand the Standard
and its implications. If Funda
mental Standard is not working
now, the education in the past
must have been inadequate, in
fact, it has been nonexistent.
The Fundamental Standard
Commission and freshmen spon
sors have not fulfilled their edu
cational obligations. These obli
gations should include a challeng-

ing speech during Freshmen Pre
Reg, discussions organized by the
sponsors, and talk;* throughout
the campus organized by the Com
mission. An important innova
tion would be the publication of
key Judicial Council cases which
would clarify Judicial Council de
cisions and thereby, demonstrate
to the Stanford Student the Fun
damental Standard in praclice.
Published quarterly, with names
omitted, this would clarify many
misinterpretations of the Stand
ard.
You're on the right track, frosh.
We hope your six weeks of discus
sion have been on a more practi
cal level than your letter indi
cates.

Condemned Men
The Chappie has done a service
!to the Stanford Man, and the
men's response to The Blast shows
how they feel. A promise of a lit
| tie competition and Miss Hess
i goes off the deep end. Rather then
I condemning the men at Stanford,
the women should undertake a
little self-examination and re-eval
uation. Just a little competition
from San Jose and insecurity
rears its ugly head. No reason
exists for Stanford men to be
strapped to a three-to-one ration.
Miss Hess is by herself with her
views; the reactions of the Stan
j ford women prove this. They rea
lize that condemning the men is
not going to accomplish their
goal. Almost 1.000 tickets have
been sold to The Blast. That's
1,000 dates Stanford women didn't
have Friday night. Don't belittle
yourselves by condemning the
Stanford men. Fight back by re
viving your femininity. How you
gonna keep 'em back on the Farm
after they've seen Paree?

Condemned Men
The Chappie has done a service
!to the Stanford Man, and the
men's response to The Blast shows
how they feel. A promise of a lit
| tie competition and Miss Hess
i goes off the deep end. Rather then
I condemning the men at Stanford,
the women should undertake a
little self-examination and re-eval
uation. Just a little competition
from San Jose and insecurity
rears its ugly head. No reason
exists for Stanford men to be
strapped to a three-to-one ration.
Miss Hess is by herself with her
views; the reactions of the Stan
j ford women prove this. They rea
lize that condemning the men is
not going to accomplish their
goal. Almost 1.000 tickets have
been sold to The Blast. That's
1,000 dates Stanford women didn't
have Friday night. Don't belittle
yourselves by condemning the
Stanford men. Fight back by re
viving your femininity. How you
gonna keep 'em back on the Farm
after they've seen Paree?

Thank you for an editorial
which points to a need (Monday,
March 6>. The ambiguities of the
Founder's Day Service are mani
festations of the general ambig
uity at Stanford University con
cerning the relations of the com
munity of learning and the com
munity of faith—the university
and the church. The extent of this
ambiguity need not continue.
There are people here, as mem
bers of (either or) both commu
nities, eager to enter and sustain
the rigorous dialogue which is so
essential for the growth and
health of both.
I would suggest that an indis
pensible starting point (in order
not to waste each others time
with more ambiguities) for stu
dents, faculty, and administration
is Ihe thoughts which that good
man of both Ihe university and
the faith, Alexander Miller, left
us in his book, "Faith and Learn

The alphabetized authors of
last Thursday's lelter discussing
the Fundamental Standard spoke
about the need of enlightening the
Stanford student in regard to the
necessary "cooperative responsi
bility between him and society."
When this responsibility has been
recognized, the freshmen feel the
Fundamental Standard will work
(which they intimate is "not work
ing as it should"). The problem
has been stated; now let's get
practical. The real issue lies in
the lack of adequate education.
No one will recognize their re
sponsibility unless first Ihey
clearly understand the Standard
and its implications. If Funda
mental Standard is not working
now, the education in the past
must have been inadequate, in
fact, it has been nonexistent.
