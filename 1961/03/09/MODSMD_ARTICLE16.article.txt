## Segregation Tensions Underlie Mardi Gras 
### 
Recently President Kenned y
praised the "quiet intelligence and
courage of those carrying out the
| court order" to integrate schools
in New Orleans.
But, as throughout the South,
the issue goes much deeper than
intelligent submission to a federal
order. For a deep fear of the
Negroes, of their numbers, and of
their embryo power, remains on
I the part of the whites.
AND IF the court order con
demns "separate, but equal" facil
ities; the whites envision a grants
in-aid plan through which parents,
ibe they Negro or white, can get
| financial aid to send their children
| to segregated schools.

I The depth of
I feeling on the
iss u e was evi
dent, even at
Mardi Gras.
For th«s year,
the laughter was
i nervous; inter-
I spersed between
I the rocking floats
I were police dogs;
I and newspaper
men kept a wary

eye on the parades for potential
stories, for segregation incidents
i at Mardi Gras!
It is the carnival organizations,
the krewes, which are the core of

| the carnival celebration. Number
ing 100 to 200 members, the
I groups exist for their part in the
j festivities, their parade, their ta
bleaux, their ball.
BUT THIS year, the NAACP
and other Negro organizations, is
sued a request that the Negro
krewes withdraw from carnival
festivities to protest Louisana's
open resistance to school integra
tion and to perhaps contribute the
; money thus saved to the NAACP
to further the cause of integra
| tion. And many krewes did this.
On the Tuesday night a week be
fore Mardi Gras, the Krewe of
Gemini got their parade off to a
confused start. For the musicians
did not show, and several floats
did not arrive on schedule; but of
; most concern—the white-frocked
! Negro flambeaux carriers went on
I Strike for higher wages, leaving
! the parade in the dark much of
! the route.
And several of the carriers said
I said they didn't think the rest of
I the night parades would be illumi
nated.
But this incident passed, and the
I number of balls and parades in
creased the last weekend before
i Mardi Gras.
FOUR, FIVE, six parades a day,
! they covered eight-mile long pa-
I rade routes lined five, ten and

twenty people deep; with
young children on their fathers'
shoulders, and men and women,
everyone shouting, "Throw me
somethin', Mista." And the krewe
members riding the floats threw
beads, dolls, trinkets to the
crowds.
There wore neighborhood pa
rades and major downtown
parades which marched by the
City Hall whore they were re
viewed by the Queen and her
court, greeted by the mayor, and
where the King stopped his float
to dring a toast of champagne to
: h'is Queen.
But the NAACP had suggested
the Negroes boycott the down
town parades, and the vast ma
j jority complied. In fact to such an
| extent that many whites ex-
J pressed concern at the power
weilded by the NAACP; and
amazement at the display of or
j derly conduct and restraint on
the part of the Negroes who
stayed away from the major
j downtown carnival celebrations.
YET NO chances were being
taken, and the police brought out
: their canine corps, new to New
I Orleans this year, to escort the
parades in an effort if) control the
| crowds and prevent any incidents.
| Three police would walk in front
of most of the parades, oach lead
ing a police dog.
Others were stationed at stra
tegig positions throughout the pa
rade, around the floats, the bands,
i the horses or cars holding the
plumed court dukes. They were
j concentrated in places where
there was a potential chance of
trouble such as around the float
in the Hermes Parade which held
in costume, along with 14 other
members of the krewe, the pro
segregation Attorney-General of
i Louisiana. Jack Germillion.
Yet one Negro krewe did have
I their parade. Since 1909 the
Krewe of Zulu has come down the
river on a raft Mardi Gras morn
ing. landing at the downtown dock
from which they start their pa
i rade.
i In 1949, Louis Armstrong was
king of Zulu. Since 1939 their
j floats have been jungle inspired,
the king and his court have worn
| grass skirts, carried spears and
shields, the maskers have thrown
! coconuts instead of flimsier trink

ets to the crowd, and the king has
worn a doorknob as a simulated
jeweled ring.
Tills YKAR, however, the lead
ers of several of the Negro organ
izations behind the boycott
charged New Orleans Mayor d(>-
Lesseps Morrison with influenc
ing the Zulu Club to hold their
parade against the wishes of the
Negro community. For they feel
"the Zulu parade is a symbol of
everything contrary to the hopes,
aspirations and desires of respon
sible Negro citizens."
Morrison and City Police Super
intendent Joseph I. Giarrusso,
who was also accused of persuad
ing Zulu to parade, said they only
asked if the club would parade
and then assured club members
they would have full police pro
tection.
Zulu's first king refused to ride,
however, and another was chosen
whose name was not disclosed.
The queen was not on her float
nor were any women when the
parade set forth heavily guarded
by police cars and surrounded by
newspaper men.
There were no incidents rising
from the segregation issue none

throughout Mardi Gras; hut the
tension was there and the safe
guards. The whites were favor
ably impressed; but they still in
; tend to send their children to pri
! vate schools.
