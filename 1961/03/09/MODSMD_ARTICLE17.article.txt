## Popularity Not Enough If JFK to Effect Plans 
### 
While President Kennedy's pop
ularity, as measured by the Gal
lup Poll, is high, he is still a long
way from having behind him a re
liable and effective majority. The
narrowness of the election is si ill
registered in Congress, particu
larly in the House, and the gen
eral upsurge of good feeling in
the country has not yet crystal
lized as practical support of his
program.
One might describe the public
mood as one of growing good will
and confidence without the excite
ment and enthusiasms of a crisis.
This will do very well for a time.
But while the Kennedy mission is

not to resolve
a crisis such
as confronted
Roosevelt in 1933,
his mission, as
he made amply
clear in the cam
paign. is to ar
rest and reverse
a decline in
i American power,
' in 112 1 uence, and
progress which

could over a period of years pro
duce critical and dangerous re
sults.
AS OF NOW, thei 'e are many
more people who like John Ken
nedy, and his appointments, and
his style of operating in office,
than there are people who under
stand and believe in what he is
committed to doing. He will have
to close this gap: he will have to
persuade the large majority who
like him that they must also be
lieve in him. Until this is done, the
important constructive measures
of his administration are headed
for serious trouble in Congress.
Such a majority cannot, I ven
ture to think, be rallied wholly or
in the main by personal popular
ity. As measured by the Gallup
Poll, Mr. Kennedy probably is
about as popular as Gen. Eisen
hower after his first month in the

White House. But his situation is
radically different from Gen. Ei
senhower's. He is committed to
positive programs that require
new laws and new appropriations
and perhaps new taxes.
The President will have to find
ways of communicating his own
convictions to a working majority
of the people. Is he not doing
that? Not adequately, so it seems
to me. There is a missing ele
ment in his press conferences, his
speeches, and his public appear
ances, and for lack of it he re
ceives much approval without
creating sufficient conviction.
That missing element is, I
think, the willingness to take the
time and to take the trouble to
explain, to expound, to describe, in
a word to teach.
HIS PRESS conferences illus
trate what I am trying to say.
They are conceived on the as
sumption that the use of a Presi
dential press conference is to pro
vide spot news. The President
makes announcements and the
correspondents ask him questions
in order to get stories, perhaps
even scoops, that have not yet
been published.
This is, 1 believe, a basically
false conception of why it is
worthwhile to have the President
submit himself to questions from
the press.
THE REAL use of the Presi
dential press conference is to en
able the President to explain his
policies and, if necessary, to com
pel him to explain them.
How the President's press con
ference can be reformed N or
transformed, or whether it should
be supplemented, are questions
which can be answered only after
some experimentation. But these
questions need to be answered.
For President Kennedy with all
his political genius is not yet in
full effective communication with
the American people.
