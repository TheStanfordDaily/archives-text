Look out fans! Stanford is importing sports from England and
the Continent, and if things get much worse you're going to have
to throw away the glove, bat, racket and shoulder pads buy a wicket
and learn a brand new vocabulary.
TRADITIONALLY the U.S. sports football, basketball and base
ball—have been considered to be the backbone of college athletics.
The three major pastimes have always been the popular crowd
pleasers and school rivalries are based on the big three.
But before thinking that home-grown sports have a strangle hold
on the athletic scene, just take a look al some of the minor activities
on the Farm. Already we've got lacrosse, cricket, soccer and now
one of the fastest growing spectator sports in the area rugby.
Actually rugby has been around for quite awhile, but recently the
English transplant seems to have caught the fancy of the sporting
public. Last week 12,000 people flocked to the Cal stadium to see the
Golden Bear ruggers take on Stanford in what was proclaimed as
the Spring Big Game.
THE GAME HAD ALL the trappings of football. Prior to the en
counter the UC student legislature proclaimed a rugby week. The
Stanford politicos did the only possible thing: They retaliated by also
proclaiming a rugby week. Prince Lightfoot put up a beaded hatchet
as a trophy for the winner, an East Bay paper donated a battleaxe
and the innocent low pressure pastime began to take on the propor
tions of the autumn warfare.
Cal had dominated the competition, in fact they'd beaten the In
dians in the last 16 games. But Stanford was having a fine season.
The locals, coached by Pete Kmetovic, had racked up eight straight
wins in their first eight games and hence the enthusiastic rivalry
for the Big Game.
A Small Injustice
There was, however, a small injustice on the field. Cal won
again, 6-5.
For most of the 12.000 spectators, rugby was an entirely new
spectacle. Each side has 15 men five backs and two breakaways, a
lock, two second rankers, two wings, a hooker and two front rankers.
Local schools . usually play in converted football stadiums and so
field dimensions vary; generally the playing area is 110 yards long
and 75 yards wide. The game is played in two 40-minute halves with
few, or no time outs.
THE MAN MAKING the offensive play must be ahead of his team
mates no downfield blocking is allowed —and when he is tackled
the runner must drop the ball. Players compete minus the protective
paraphernalia common to American football.
Scoring is accomplished by making a try—running the ball over

the goal, worth three points, or by
kicking the ball through the goal.
Since the ball is shorted and wider
than the conventional football,
kicking is emphasized.
"After every try," says Kmeto
vic, "the runner keeps running,
even after crossing the goal line,
trying to get to the center of the
end zone and the defending team
trys to bring him down. The ball
is brought straight out to the
25-yard line from the spot where
the runner was tackled and the
scoring team gets to attempt a
conversion kick. The conversion
is worth two points, penalty kicks
are worth three and so you can
see why kicking can be very im
portant."
HANDLING the Cards' booting
is Kyrk Reid, who plays the
hooker position. Reid started out
at Stanford as a football player,
then switched to the winter sport
and is responsible for much of the
team's success this season. In
nine games Kyrk has scored (56
points and during the road trip to
Los Angeles he tallied 17 times, in
cluding an 11 -point outburst
against UCLA.
It's not unusual to see football
players on the rugby field. As
Kmetovic puts it, "Most of our
team is made up of football play
ers and the end of our season co
incides with the beginning of
spring practice. We're not re
stricted to just football players
though. We've got a freshman
from England. Keith Richman,
playing for the JVs right now and
he may move up to the varsity in
a year or two."
ALL BUT A few of the Farm
ruggers get their firsl taste of the
game after they get to Stanford,
and this year they picked up
fundamentals well enough to post
a good winning record. There is
just one thing that bothers Coach
Kmetovic: "I'd say that our best
season was in '53, the last time
we beat Cal. This could be our
best year ever if we could just
beat them, and I think we will."
The ruggers get their last
chance this Saturday when the
Berkeley team invades the Farm
in the locals' last game of the
year. We're confident that Stan
ford will win; we're looking
around the office now for an axe
of our own to donate.

are worth three and so you can
see why kicking can be very im
portant."
HANDLING the Cards' booting
is Kyrk Reid, who plays the
hooker position. Reid started out
at Stanford as a football player,
then switched to the winter sport
and is responsible for much of the
team's success this season. In
nine games Kyrk has scored (56
points and during the road trip to
Los Angeles he tallied 17 times, in
cluding an 11 -point outburst
against UCLA.
It's not unusual to see football
players on the rugby field. As
Kmetovic puts it, "Most of our
team is made up of football play
ers and the end of our season co
incides with the beginning of
spring practice. We're not re
stricted to just football players
though. We've got a freshman
from England. Keith Richman,
playing for the JVs right now and
he may move up to the varsity in
a year or two."
ALL BUT A few of the Farm
ruggers get their firsl taste of the
game after they get to Stanford,
and this year they picked up
fundamentals well enough to post
a good winning record. There is
just one thing that bothers Coach
Kmetovic: "I'd say that our best
season was in '53, the last time
we beat Cal. This could be our
best year ever if we could just
beat them, and I think we will."
The ruggers get their last
chance this Saturday when the
Berkeley team invades the Farm
in the locals' last game of the
year. We're confident that Stan
ford will win; we're looking
around the office now for an axe
of our own to donate.
Look out fans! Stanford is importing sports from England and
the Continent, and if things get much worse you're going to have
to throw away the glove, bat, racket and shoulder pads buy a wicket
and learn a brand new vocabulary.
TRADITIONALLY the U.S. sports football, basketball and base
ball—have been considered to be the backbone of college athletics.
The three major pastimes have always been the popular crowd
pleasers and school rivalries are based on the big three.
But before thinking that home-grown sports have a strangle hold
on the athletic scene, just take a look al some of the minor activities
on the Farm. Already we've got lacrosse, cricket, soccer and now
one of the fastest growing spectator sports in the area rugby.
Actually rugby has been around for quite awhile, but recently the
English transplant seems to have caught the fancy of the sporting
public. Last week 12,000 people flocked to the Cal stadium to see the
Golden Bear ruggers take on Stanford in what was proclaimed as
the Spring Big Game.
THE GAME HAD ALL the trappings of football. Prior to the en
counter the UC student legislature proclaimed a rugby week. The
Stanford politicos did the only possible thing: They retaliated by also
proclaiming a rugby week. Prince Lightfoot put up a beaded hatchet
as a trophy for the winner, an East Bay paper donated a battleaxe
and the innocent low pressure pastime began to take on the propor
tions of the autumn warfare.
Cal had dominated the competition, in fact they'd beaten the In
dians in the last 16 games. But Stanford was having a fine season.
The locals, coached by Pete Kmetovic, had racked up eight straight
wins in their first eight games and hence the enthusiastic rivalry
for the Big Game.
A Small Injustice
There was, however, a small injustice on the field. Cal won
again, 6-5.
For most of the 12.000 spectators, rugby was an entirely new
spectacle. Each side has 15 men five backs and two breakaways, a
lock, two second rankers, two wings, a hooker and two front rankers.
Local schools . usually play in converted football stadiums and so
field dimensions vary; generally the playing area is 110 yards long
and 75 yards wide. The game is played in two 40-minute halves with
few, or no time outs.
THE MAN MAKING the offensive play must be ahead of his team
mates no downfield blocking is allowed —and when he is tackled
the runner must drop the ball. Players compete minus the protective
paraphernalia common to American football.
Scoring is accomplished by making a try—running the ball over

the goal, worth three points, or by
kicking the ball through the goal.
Since the ball is shorted and wider
than the conventional football,
kicking is emphasized.
"After every try," says Kmeto
vic, "the runner keeps running,
even after crossing the goal line,
trying to get to the center of the
end zone and the defending team
trys to bring him down. The ball
is brought straight out to the
25-yard line from the spot where
the runner was tackled and the
scoring team gets to attempt a
conversion kick. The conversion
is worth two points, penalty kicks
are worth three and so you can
see why kicking can be very im

Cal had dominated the competition, in fact they'd beaten the In
dians in the last 16 games. But Stanford was having a fine season.
The locals, coached by Pete Kmetovic, had racked up eight straight
wins in their first eight games and hence the enthusiastic rivalry
for the Big Game.
A Small Injustice
There was, however, a small injustice on the field. Cal won
again, 6-5.
For most of the 12.000 spectators, rugby was an entirely new
spectacle. Each side has 15 men five backs and two breakaways, a
lock, two second rankers, two wings, a hooker and two front rankers.
Local schools . usually play in converted football stadiums and so
field dimensions vary; generally the playing area is 110 yards long
and 75 yards wide. The game is played in two 40-minute halves with
few, or no time outs.
THE MAN MAKING the offensive play must be ahead of his team
mates no downfield blocking is allowed —and when he is tackled
the runner must drop the ball. Players compete minus the protective
paraphernalia common to American football.
Scoring is accomplished by making a try—running the ball over

the goal, worth three points, or by
kicking the ball through the goal.
Since the ball is shorted and wider
than the conventional football,
kicking is emphasized.
"After every try," says Kmeto
vic, "the runner keeps running,
even after crossing the goal line,
trying to get to the center of the
end zone and the defending team
trys to bring him down. The ball
is brought straight out to the
25-yard line from the spot where
the runner was tackled and the
scoring team gets to attempt a
conversion kick. The conversion
is worth two points, penalty kicks
are worth three and so you can
see why kicking can be very im
portant."
HANDLING the Cards' booting
is Kyrk Reid, who plays the
hooker position. Reid started out
at Stanford as a football player,
then switched to the winter sport
and is responsible for much of the
team's success this season. In
nine games Kyrk has scored (56
points and during the road trip to
Los Angeles he tallied 17 times, in
cluding an 11 -point outburst
against UCLA.
It's not unusual to see football
players on the rugby field. As
Kmetovic puts it, "Most of our
team is made up of football play
ers and the end of our season co
incides with the beginning of
spring practice. We're not re
stricted to just football players
though. We've got a freshman
from England. Keith Richman,
playing for the JVs right now and
he may move up to the varsity in
a year or two."
ALL BUT A few of the Farm
ruggers get their firsl taste of the
game after they get to Stanford,
and this year they picked up
fundamentals well enough to post
a good winning record. There is
just one thing that bothers Coach
Kmetovic: "I'd say that our best
season was in '53, the last time
we beat Cal. This could be our
best year ever if we could just
beat them, and I think we will."
The ruggers get their last
chance this Saturday when the
Berkeley team invades the Farm
in the locals' last game of the
year. We're confident that Stan
ford will win; we're looking
around the office now for an axe
of our own to donate.
Look out fans! Stanford is importing sports from England and
the Continent, and if things get much worse you're going to have
to throw away the glove, bat, racket and shoulder pads buy a wicket
and learn a brand new vocabulary.
TRADITIONALLY the U.S. sports football, basketball and base
ball—have been considered to be the backbone of college athletics.
The three major pastimes have always been the popular crowd
pleasers and school rivalries are based on the big three.
But before thinking that home-grown sports have a strangle hold
on the athletic scene, just take a look al some of the minor activities
on the Farm. Already we've got lacrosse, cricket, soccer and now
one of the fastest growing spectator sports in the area rugby.
Actually rugby has been around for quite awhile, but recently the
English transplant seems to have caught the fancy of the sporting
public. Last week 12,000 people flocked to the Cal stadium to see the
Golden Bear ruggers take on Stanford in what was proclaimed as
the Spring Big Game.
THE GAME HAD ALL the trappings of football. Prior to the en
counter the UC student legislature proclaimed a rugby week. The
Stanford politicos did the only possible thing: They retaliated by also
proclaiming a rugby week. Prince Lightfoot put up a beaded hatchet
as a trophy for the winner, an East Bay paper donated a battleaxe
and the innocent low pressure pastime began to take on the propor
tions of the autumn warfare.
