# DEFENDING AAWU CHAMPIONS
## Golfers Set for Good Season Daily Sports 
### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
When Stanford golf Coach Bud
Finger assayed the prospects for
the coming season, he summed
them up in tin 1 neat phrase, "We
had a sensational season last
spring, and we should he as good,
or even a little better this year."
SENSATIONAL is, indeed, the
nroper word to describe the Farm
linksters' 1060 record. The Tribe
walked away with the AAWU
championship, finishing4l strokes

ahead of their nearest competitors
and in the process setting a new
record of 1,192 for the four-man,
72-hole tourney. Pete Choate won
the individual crown and four out
of the top five places went to
Stanford golfers.
IN THE 1960 NCAA champion
ships at Colorado Springs last
June, Card Steve Smith beat one
of the world's best amateurs. Jack
Nicklajas of Ohio State, in the
third round, 4 and 3. Smith went
on to win all of his remaining
matches before losing to Bill
Crawford of Houston on the 36th
hole in the finals to take second
place in the nation.
Already the locals are back in
the win grove this year with a
19-8 victory over Peninsula Coun
try Club last Friday in their open
ing match.
BRIGHTENING the outlook for
the current campaign is the fact
that all but one of the veterans of
the '60 squad are returning. The
varsity loses Bill Seanor, but all
of the remaining Cards are back
with more experience under their
belts.
Kent Winton and Bill Farish
head the top six, Winton playing

in the top spot at the moment
and Farish at number two. Both
i golfers have tournament experi
ence. Winton won the California
! State Fair two years ago while
[Farish qualified for the National
1 Open last year and turned in a
hot 68 at the Crosby tournament
i in January.
Bill Welch, one of two sopho
mores on the team, is third man
and Phil Underwood, a senior, is
I fourth. Smith is having his trou

] hies right now and is playing in
1 the fifth spot, but Finger expects
him to get back on his game and
move up the ranks.
Shooting in the sixth starting
position is the team's other sopho
more, Dave Munro. a veteran of
junior tournaments and last
!year's frosh team. Backing up the
first line are Dave Hall, Cappy
{Hurst and Mike Kuhlman.
CHOATI'i is ineligible for play
I this quarter, but he should be
back at the start of spring action
and vVi'l probably win one of the
starting berths.
A twist of fa'e was mentioned
by Coach Finger. "One of Wash
ington's best golfers will be Jack
Leney," he said. "Just last year
he was attending Stanford, but
he transferred. If we'd had him
on the team, we'd really been set."
As it is. Washington figures to
i have one of the strongest teams
I on the coast with UCLA, runner
| up in the AAWU last year, and
j USC also furnishing tough com
petition.
The golf team gets its next test
j tomorrow when they host San
; Francisco State and Saturday the
i locals meet the Alumni on the
} Stanford course.
