# Library Privileges Abused; Open Stacks May Be Closed
## 
### 
The extended library hours
which now permit browsing in
the stacks until 11 p.m. on Sun
days may be discontinued after
March 12. The reason: Excessive
abuse of the privilege of open
stacks.
"FOR the first time in six years
we feel helpless and appalled in
attempting to maintain the stack
as we believe it should be," de
clared Jack Plotkin, chief libra
rian of the circulation division.
Four weeks ago the Main Li
brary extended its hours on an
experimental basis, allowing stu
dents to use the Reserve Book
Room, the Humanities and Social
Sciences Rooms and the Loan
Desk as well as the stacks until
11 p.m. Sunday through Friday.
BECAUSE the library received
no additional funds to extend its
hours, the money for this purpose
has come from money appropri
ated for personnel salaries. This
fund does not provide for super
vision of the stacks on Sunday
from 5 to 11 p.m. This lack of
supervision on Sunday has re
sulted in misuse of the books. The!
condition of the stacks facing the !

staff on Monday morning is a
chaotic one.
An estimated $7."5 must be spent
cleaning up the stacks every Mon
day because of the students' ac
tions over t lie weekend. "A repe
tition of the situation that faced
us on the last four Mondays will
result in the closing of the stacks
at 5 when the full crew goes off
duty," said Elmer Grieder, acting
director of libraries.
ABUSES of the library include
smoking and eating in the stacks
and deliberate efforts to sabotage
the stack opening by misplace
ment of books. As pictured, re
moval of the books from the
shelves on Sunday leaves the
stacks in shambles.
Since the stacks contain over
800,000 volumes, a misplaced book
is the same as a lost book. The
unshelved and misplaced books
are unavailable to all except the
person who may have purposely
misshelved the books to save
them for his own use.
If the situation does not im
prove. the library staff will have
to resort to some kind of change,
including possibly closing the
stacks to undergraduate students.

staff on Monday morning is a
chaotic one.
An estimated $7."5 must be spent
cleaning up the stacks every Mon
day because of the students' ac
tions over t lie weekend. "A repe
tition of the situation that faced
us on the last four Mondays will
result in the closing of the stacks
at 5 when the full crew goes off
duty," said Elmer Grieder, acting
director of libraries.
ABUSES of the library include
smoking and eating in the stacks
and deliberate efforts to sabotage
the stack opening by misplace
ment of books. As pictured, re
moval of the books from the
shelves on Sunday leaves the
stacks in shambles.
Since the stacks contain over
800,000 volumes, a misplaced book
is the same as a lost book. The
unshelved and misplaced books
are unavailable to all except the
person who may have purposely
misshelved the books to save
them for his own use.
If the situation does not im
prove. the library staff will have
to resort to some kind of change,
including possibly closing the
stacks to undergraduate students.
The extended library hours
which now permit browsing in
the stacks until 11 p.m. on Sun
days may be discontinued after
March 12. The reason: Excessive
abuse of the privilege of open
stacks.
"FOR the first time in six years
we feel helpless and appalled in
attempting to maintain the stack
as we believe it should be," de
clared Jack Plotkin, chief libra
rian of the circulation division.
Four weeks ago the Main Li
brary extended its hours on an
experimental basis, allowing stu
dents to use the Reserve Book
Room, the Humanities and Social
Sciences Rooms and the Loan
Desk as well as the stacks until
11 p.m. Sunday through Friday.
BECAUSE the library received
no additional funds to extend its
hours, the money for this purpose
has come from money appropri
ated for personnel salaries. This
fund does not provide for super
vision of the stacks on Sunday
from 5 to 11 p.m. This lack of
supervision on Sunday has re
sulted in misuse of the books. The!
condition of the stacks facing the !

staff on Monday morning is a
chaotic one.
