## I WAS A TEEN-AGE SLIDE RULE 
### Author of "I Was a Teen-age Dwarf", "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis", etc 
In a recent learned journal {Mud) the distinguished hoard
chairman (Ralph "Ilot-Lips" Sigafoos) of one of our most
important American corporations (the Arf Mechanical I )og Co.)
wrote a trenchant article in which he pinpointed our gravest
national problem: the lack of culture among science graduates.
Mr. Sigafoos's article, it must be emphasized, was in no sense
derogatory, lie stated quite clearly that the science student,
what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, math, and chem
istry,' can hardly be expected to find time to study the arts
too. What Mr. Sigafoos deplores—indeed, what we all deplore
- is I Ik- lopsided result of today's science courses: graduates
who can build a bridge but can't compose a concerto, who know
Planck's Constant but not Botticelli's Venus, who arc familiar
with Fraunhofer's lines but not with Schiller's.
Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this hideous imbalance.
I, however, believe there is one—and a very simple one. It is
111i~: if students of science don't have time to come to the arts,
then we must let the arts conic to students of scicncc.

For example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry
and music right along with physics. Students, instead of merely
being called upon to recite in physics class, would instead be
required to rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tunes
— like, for instance, The Colonel Bogey March. Thus recitations
would not only be chock-full of important facts but would, at
the same time, expose the student to the aesthetic delights of
great music. Here, try it yourself. You all know The Colonel
Bogey March. Come, sing along with me:
Physics
/.s what ivc learn in class.
Einstein
Said energy is muss,
Newton
Is lnghfalulin
A nd. Pascal's a rascal. So's Boyle.
T)o you see how much more broadening, how much more
uplifting to learn physics this way? Of course you do. What?
You want another chorus? iiy all means:
Leyden
lie made the Leyden jar,
Trolley
He made Ihc Trolley car,
Curie
Bode in a surrey,
nd DieseVs a weasel. So's Boyle.
Once the student has mastered The Colonel Bogey March, he
can go on to more complicated melodies like Death and Treins-
Jifjuration, the Eroica, and Love M< Tender.
And when the student, loaded with science and culture,
leaves the classroom and lights his Marlboro, how much more
lie will enjoy that filter, that flavor, that pack or box! Because
there will no longer be ;m uncase gnawing at his soul, no longer
:i little voice within him repeating that lie is culturally a dolt.
lie will know—know joyously—that he 1 is a fulfilled man, a
whole man, and he will bask and revel in the pleasure of his
Marlboro as a colt rolls in new gr:is> content, complete, truly
educated—a credit to his college, tu himself, and to his tobac

Mr. Sigafoos can find no solution to this hideous imbalance.
I, however, believe there is one—and a very simple one. It is
111i~: if students of science don't have time to come to the arts,
then we must let the arts conic to students of scicncc.

For example, it would be a very easy thing to teach poetry
and music right along with physics. Students, instead of merely
being called upon to recite in physics class, would instead be
required to rhyme their answers and set them to familiar tunes
— like, for instance, The Colonel Bogey March. Thus recitations
would not only be chock-full of important facts but would, at
the same time, expose the student to the aesthetic delights of
great music. Here, try it yourself. You all know The Colonel
Bogey March. Come, sing along with me:
Physics
/.s what ivc learn in class.
Einstein
Said energy is muss,
Newton
Is lnghfalulin
A nd. Pascal's a rascal. So's Boyle.
T)o you see how much more broadening, how much more
uplifting to learn physics this way? Of course you do. What?
You want another chorus? iiy all means:
Leyden
lie made the Leyden jar,
Trolley
He made Ihc Trolley car,
Curie
Bode in a surrey,
nd DieseVs a weasel. So's Boyle.
Once the student has mastered The Colonel Bogey March, he
can go on to more complicated melodies like Death and Treins-
Jifjuration, the Eroica, and Love M< Tender.
And when the student, loaded with science and culture,
leaves the classroom and lights his Marlboro, how much more
lie will enjoy that filter, that flavor, that pack or box! Because
there will no longer be ;m uncase gnawing at his soul, no longer
:i little voice within him repeating that lie is culturally a dolt.

In a recent learned journal {Mud) the distinguished hoard
chairman (Ralph "Ilot-Lips" Sigafoos) of one of our most
important American corporations (the Arf Mechanical I )og Co.)
wrote a trenchant article in which he pinpointed our gravest
national problem: the lack of culture among science graduates.
Mr. Sigafoos's article, it must be emphasized, was in no sense
derogatory, lie stated quite clearly that the science student,
what with his gruelling curriculum in physics, math, and chem
istry,' can hardly be expected to find time to study the arts
too. What Mr. Sigafoos deplores—indeed, what we all deplore
- is I Ik- lopsided result of today's science courses: graduates
who can build a bridge but can't compose a concerto, who know
Planck's Constant but not Botticelli's Venus, who arc familiar
with Fraunhofer's lines but not with Schiller's.
