# Mosk Wants Immediate Action on Discrimination
## Fraternities at State Colleges Should Eliminate Clauses 
### JANET ROSS 
"Immediate action should be taken regarding fraternity discrimi
natory clauses in California state colleges," California Atty. Gen.
Stanley Mosk, said last night at Cubberley Auditorium.
Mosk stated, "there is no question of legality of eliminating dis
criminatory clauses from the state schools because every California

resident regardless of pace, color,
or religion contributes to their
support."
He continued, "Any immediate
action would not include the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley,
however, because their Board of
Regents has previously set 1964
as a deadline for all campus fra
ternities to alter any discrimina
tory clause or get off campus."
"PRIVATE schools are another
problem," he said, "since they are
not subject to regulation by the
state."
Therefore, Mosk particularly
"commends Sterling and the Stan
| foi d campus for their general pol
icy of having all organizations on
! campus choose their members
| without regard for the way a man
| worships his God."
"THE national ATO is just go-
I ing to lose out in tho long run,"he
| he said, "as other ATO locals are
! going to have to alter or go off
' campuses."
| "The national is shortsighted,
bigoted and prejudiced," he stated.
Mosk backed up a previous
j statement to "fight discriminatory
| clauses" by stating that if the lo
i cal chapter of a fraternity wants
to go to court to prevent the na
tional from removing its charter,
he will assist. "But this is com
pletely up to the fraternity," he
j said.
Mosk made these comments in
! a question session after his speech
concerning "law and the law on
; foreement problem in California."
HE discussed civil and criminal
j law and stated, "there is no indi
cation of organized crime in Call
j fornia. Organized crime cannot
j exist without the connivance of
officialdom, so this is a tribute to
; the integrity of the law enforce
.ment officers throughout the
I state."
He also described the "thorough
survey of the narcotic problem
| which was made in California for
the first time last year and for
I the first time in any state."
Some of the findings of the sur
: vey included: 72 per cent of Ihe
' addicts are men, ST per cent of the
men are under forty, and S3 per
cent of those arrested last year
■ had prioi criminal records.

"PRIVATE schools are another
problem," he said, "since they are
not subject to regulation by the
state."

bigoted and prejudiced," he stated.
Mosk backed up a previous
j statement to "fight discriminatory

i cal chapter of a fraternity wants
to go to court to prevent the na

he will assist. "But this is com
pletely up to the fraternity," he

Mosk made these comments in

concerning "law and the law on
; foreement problem in California."
HE discussed civil and criminal
j law and stated, "there is no indi
cation of organized crime in Call

j exist without the connivance of
officialdom, so this is a tribute to

I state."
He also described the "thorough
survey of the narcotic problem

the first time last year and for
I the first time in any state."
Some of the findings of the sur

"Immediate action should be taken regarding fraternity discrimi
natory clauses in California state colleges," California Atty. Gen.
Stanley Mosk, said last night at Cubberley Auditorium.
Mosk stated, "there is no question of legality of eliminating dis
criminatory clauses from the state schools because every California

resident regardless of pace, color,
or religion contributes to their
support."
He continued, "Any immediate
action would not include the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley,
however, because their Board of
Regents has previously set 1964
as a deadline for all campus fra
ternities to alter any discrimina
tory clause or get off campus."
