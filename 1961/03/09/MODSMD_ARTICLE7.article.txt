# Little Awarded Sloan Grant For Research
## 
### 
i Dr. William A. Little, an assist
! ant professor in the Physics De
j part ment, has been named one of
! the recipients of the two-year un
restricted research grants of the
i Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
I
The foundation also announced
tho appointment of Dr. Leonard
I. Schiff. chairman of Stanford's
Physics Department, to member
ship in the program committee of
i the foundation. The program com
i mittee makes recommendations to
| the committee on scientific proj
; ects, which is composed of founda
i tion trustees.
PROFESSORS selected as Sloan
i Research Fellows receive grants
for basic research in the broad
j fields of chemistry, mathematics,
! physics, and related areas. The
I scientists are free to determine
! their own course of research,
| since the foundaton professes to
j support people rather than proj-
I ects. The fellows are faculty mem
j ber-s of 35 U.S. and 2 Canadian
i educational institutions.
Selection of Sloan Fellows is
I limited to relatively young scien
j tists who are faculty members of
institutions of higher learning,
j They are usually nominated by
I their department chairmen and
I other senior scientists. Since the
, program was inaugurated in 1955,
' 22.1 scientists in 65 universities
i have received awards.
ACCORDING TO the founda
tion and its advisers, more atten
tion will be given in the future to
the able young scientist interested
in an interdisciplinary approach,
that is, in research lying between
two or more classical scientific
fields, such as research in astro
physics, geochemistry, and bio
physics.
Because of the developing rela
tionship in modern science be
tween previously unrelated disci
plines, such research has become
. increasingly significant.
