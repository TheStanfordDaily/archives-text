## 
### 
Mike Kavanaugh. president
of Stanford's chapter of Al
pha Tau Omega Fraternity,
doubts that California Attor
ney-General Stanley Mosk
will be effective in compelling
fraternities on California col

obey the discriminatory
clauses in their charters.
"It appears that Mr. Mosk
will do what he can to see that
they refuse to obey these
clauses," said Kavanaugh,
"but I am in doubt as to how
effective his action will be."
Kavanaugh added, "We
want to thank Mr. Mosk for
the accolade that he gave to
our chapter."
