"DEAD WEEK" - "FINALS" - "SKIING"
Snow cover in the Sierras has been renewed, and conditions
are ideal for that Spring ski vacation.
We are beginning a sale of the finest (and wildest) parkas
ever to grace a ski slope. Nylon quilted parkas; reversibles
(from $15.99) fur-lined, pullovers (from $7.99). This
special group of parkas is accompanied by the usual acces
sories (such as skis, boots, poles, pants, gloves) at prices
that cannot- be beaten anywhere on the Peninsula. Our
rental rates for Easter week (or any other week) are the
lowest to be found anywhere, and if this ad is brought into
Pacific Stores in Palo Alto you can get an extra 10% dis
count on rentals—and that resulting low price will not be
equalled by any store. Remember ....
