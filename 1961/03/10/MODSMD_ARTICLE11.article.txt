# FIFTH ANNIVERSARY
## Monday's Sequoia Honors Winters 
### DAVID LEVIN 
(Editor's Nolo: David Levin is
mm associate professor of English
at Stanford, and author of "His
tory as Romantic Art.")

The winter issue of Sequoia,
which goes on sale Monday, will
become a collector's item, for it
is a Winters issue: a tribute to
Professor Yvor Winters that in
cludes a new poem by Marianne
Moore, new essays by Allen Tate,
Albert J. Gucrard, Alan Swallow,
and J. V. Cunningham, and three
poems from Mr. Winters' own
prize-winning "Collected Poems."
These names alone should cause
the first printing of 1,600 copies
to be sold out quickly, but the
subslance of Hie issue also makes
this printing noteworthy. In cele
bration <>i its fifth anniversary,

Sequoia chooses a splendid way
to reaffirm its dedication to ex
cellence.
THIS TRIBUTE to an eminent
poet, critic, and teacher publishes
poems and essays by friends and
students ranging in age from the
middle seventies to ihe very early
twenties. All of the contributors
have learned from him. The con
sistently high quality of the verse
and the variety of the literary
.judgments reveal as much about
the value of this critic and teacher
as do the anecdotes.
In two concise pages, Allen Tale
presents a moving acknowledg
ment of his indebtedness to Win
ters and a statement of his dis
agreement: in a brief essay on
Winters' only published short
story, Albert Guerard demon
strates tlwit a student of psycho
logical fiction who considers Win

tors "the best of his teachers" can
still write h kind of criticism quite
different from that which the
teacher has recommended.
THE ESSAY' by Winters him
self. on the poetry of one of his
former students, illustrates his
continuing willingness to instruct,
even while he praises, those stu
dents whose work he values most
highly. This essay on Helen Pink
erton's roetrv, moreover, reprints
a poem of hers that is itself rea
son enough to treasure the Issue.
The editors, as well as the con
tributors. deserve to be congratu
lated. They have, however, al
lowed one or two errata to creep
into this first printing so that it
will be distinguished from its suc
cessors.
Look for "Louisiana" and "Swa
nee Review" in the notes on con
tributors, and hoard your copies.
