# LASSU Puts Student Cops In Stack Area
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
Two unidentified student police
men will patrol the Main Library
stacks Sunday night in an attempt
to catch whoever is responsible
for recent misuse of the stacks.
Legislature ordered the move
by an 8-7 vote last night after
hearing a report detailing wide
spread trouble in the stacks Sun
days and warning if mistreatment
of books continued this Sunday
the stacks would be closed after
5 p.m. the remaining two Sundays
of the quarterâ€”and perhaps the
rest of the year.
AFTER adopting 1 lie resolution,
LASSU also approved by a 9-7
vote a motion by Stern represent
ative Charles Lofgren requesting
The Daily not report today
LASSU's action in placing the
policemen in the stacks.
The group decided to allocate
funds to pay for the two patrol
men over the objections of several
of its members, who suggested
that Legislature representatives
themselves watch over the area
Sunday night rather than the stu
dent cops.
Women's Row rep Mary Grif
fing. quoting extensively from a
letter by E. M. Grieder, acting di
rector of the library, reported the
Sunday trouble is taking place
from the time the regular staff
leaves at 5 p.m. until the stacks
close at 11 p.m.
GRIEDER said in his letter "we
are willing to keep the stacks
open . . . March 12, on a trial
basis. A repetition of the situa
tion that faced us on the last four
Mondays will result in the closing
of the stacks at" 5 p.m. the re
maining two Sundays of the quar
ter.
"We simply cannot spend $7.)
every Monday on cleaning up,"
the letter stated.
Grieder noted, however, "Un
doubtedly a very few students are
responsible (for the trouble) as
usual; and as usual, all students
must suffer for ther lack of stand
ards."
HE ALSO declared "We have
no funds for a police operation
to prevent smoking, eating . . .
and what we can only conclude
is a deliberate effort to sabotage
the stack opening by misplace
ment of books and other abuses."
Most members of LASSU voiced
concern over the fact that the
stacks may be closed to all except
graduate students and faculty if
the situation continues. They
noted that Stanford is one of a
handful of major universities
with stacks open to undergradu
ates.
Legislature also was concerned
with the obvious Fundamental
Stan d a r d violations occurring
week after week. And Ed Cutter,
administrative assistant to ASSU
President Larry Royse, declared
the idea of cops in the stacks went
against the spirit behind the
Fundamental Standard.
HAN SWYTER, assistant finan
cial manager, suggested that
LASSU members volunteer for
patrol duty Sunday. Several mem
bers felt, however, that violators
nabbed would not cooperate with
Legislature members, and il might
be difficult to get those caught to
hand over their student body
cards, whereas student police
would have the authority - and
size to obtain the cards.
