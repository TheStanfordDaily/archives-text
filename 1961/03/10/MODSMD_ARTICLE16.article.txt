# Founders' Day Change Necessary
## 
### 
The rather meaningless Founders' Day service last Sunday gives
clear evidence that a more appropriate type of Founders' Day cele
bration should be found. The University should not take advantage
of a capacity Sunday church audience to commemorate the found
ers with an address which, while perceptively conceived and well
delivered, was out of place.
This, of course, does not mean that a commemoration should
not be held. Both of the founders looked on the Church as the key
stone of the University. Certainly a Memorial Service, held on
Founders' Day during the week, would be more appropriate. How
ever, until we pass through the current debunking-of-the-founders
phase, the most practical solution would be a simple wreath-laying
ceremony in front of Memorial Church. Something more should be
done, however, to make Founders' Day a memorable event on the
campus. The University could follow the lead of the University of
California's Charter Day ceremony by bringing an outstanding
speaker in the field of education to the campus. Or it could present
a special program of Stanford today, such as "Sciences in the
1960s at Stanford." This type of program would not interfere with
the Stanford Today and Tomorrow program, for it would deal with
bringing a sector of Stanford life, the scientist for instance, into
view for the rest of the University, in this instance, the non-scientist.
The Committee on Public Exercises is an able group. By work
ing hard at their next meeting, they could develop both a mem
orable and stimulating Founders' Day.
