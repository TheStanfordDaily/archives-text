# Sequoia Honors Winters; Provides Top Reading
## 
### 
In recent years Stanford's literary magazine, the Sequoia, has
been staging a winning, but uphill battle to sell enough copies to
pay its cost of production. We predict they will have little trouble
with the new issue, scheduled to go on sale Monday.
It is appropriate that Sequoia, in its fifth year anniversary should
honor Yvor Winters in a special issue. As Editor Gary Dickson says,
"Yvor Winters, distinguished poet, critic, and teacher, has, by his
presence, brought honor to Stanford University for over thirty years.
A Stanford tribute to him is long overdue."
Mr. Winters has had a long and varied, and until the award of
the Bollingen Prize for poetry last February, an incompletely recog
nized career in American letters. He has said that poets are rarely
consistent in their own theories and practice, but he has noted that
he is an exception to this rule. Through a lifetime of study of poetry,
he has developed the traditional theories of reason and judgment
in the writing of poetry â€”and from these he will not flinch.
To meet the uncompromising integrity of a man like Yvor Win
ters in the twentieth century is often a harsh and unique experience
for the student, accustomed to academic toleration of all theories.
As Thom Gunn has said, "Winters is tough in will."
To honor him, the Sequoia has assembled a first-rate list of
writers of high literary credit; These writers not only honor Mr.
Winters, as well as he should be, but also provide absorbing and
challenging reading for the college student.
