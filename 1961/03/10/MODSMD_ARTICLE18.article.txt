## College Newspapers Differ Over JFK's Peace Corps 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Almost everyone is for the idea
of a Peace Corps. A recent Gal
lup Poll discovered that only 6
per cent of the American people
said they were against it.
Students support the idea even
more than their parents. Perhaps
a typical comment of the ideal
istic student is a noble-sounding
editorial from the University
Daily Kansan: "In the festering
world the Silent Generation has
been handed, sacrifice and dedica
tion are the only solutions."
EVERYONE may be for the

Peace Corps idea,
but everyone is
not for the Peace
Corps plan. Don
Bone, National
Student Associa
tion Coordinator,
said "The way
Kennedy wants
to set it up im
mediately and
crash into it is
going to create

so much havoc and confusion
among nations that the whole pro
gram will succumb to nothing."
The Daily Californian disagrees
with Bone's statements. "Students
hope the program begins now, not
in the far distant future," the
Daily Cal wrote.
Disappointment in the plan was
expressed by A1 Guskin, spokes
man of the Americans Committed
to World Responsibility at the
University of Michigan. "Most of
the sludents we talked with
strongly believed that the Peace
Corps â€¢should have nothing to do
with the State Department under
the existing foreign policy."
GUSKIN continued that "The
period before Congress acts on
4 he proposed Peace Corps is a

crucial time for students who are
not satisfied with the program
under State Department super
vision." Guskin is one of those
people who believe that the Corps
will be more effective if it is de
tached from past foreign policy.
The reactions of foreign stu
dents vary from extreme praise to
hard criticism. "It is an important
step to combat Communist, ac
tivities," a Nigerian student at the
University of Minnesota said.
Another African, an Ethiopian
from the University of Washing
ton, expressed what might be a
more typical foreign reaction. "If
the Americans want to impress us
by living with us, they had better
start with a good housecleaning in
their own country," he said.
MOST OF the editorial com
ments about the Peace Corps in
university newspapers in the last
month have concerned the draft
exemption issue. The University
of Cincinnati News Record com
mented "President Kennedy had
the best plan when he proposed
that service in the Peace Corps
eliminate draft requirements.
Now it appears that this may be
changed. We hope not."
The Cincinnati comment was
prompted by the results of the
Peace Corps study which Con
gress authorized. In it, Dr. Max
Millikan of MIT said that suffi
cient volunteers for the Peace
Corps can be obtained without the
"bait" of draft exemption. No
doubt he is right, since he defines
sufficient as a few thousand.
Students will always criticize
anything as specific and perhaps
as political as Kennedy's Peace
Corps plan. Luckily students seem
also willing to suppot something
as vital and far reaching as Ken
nedy's Peace Corps idea.
