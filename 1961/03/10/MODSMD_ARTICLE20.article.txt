## Denies Stanford Girls a Tyrannical Minority, Calls for End to Feud 
### 
"Why should we allow a tyran
ny of the minority?" asks Bill
Kitchen, editor of the Chaparral
and organizer of last Friday's
"Blast" in San Jose. "The reason
\vp don't import more girls for
Ihe Stanford men is that we are
afraid to hurt the feelings of the
Stanford women."
The Stanford women, of course,
are Ihe tyrannical minority he
refers to. And the Stanford men
are the victimized majority.
The Old Boy, who labelled Stan
ford "the nation's social Sahara"
in a recent Chappie editorial, pin-

pointed the three
basic causes of
the Farm prob
lem. First, he
said, there aren't
enough women
to go around;
second, women
to offset the
ratio — mainly
Mills and San
San Jose coeds—
are too far away

from the campus to be conveni
tently reached; and third, there is
I little or no opportunity for people
to get acquainted in a relaxed,
non-dated social situation.
DECLARING that the problem
"has serious implications in the
welfare and education of the stu
dents," Kitchen deplored the un
concerned attitude of the admin
istration and the ASSU.
First, he said, ASSU should
sponsor a series of stag dances of
the jolly-up variety; they should
invite Mills girls to these dances
and should provide bus transpor
tation to and from Stanford. In
addition, there should be more ex
changes like The Blast to foster
; friendly relations with the women
| of San Jose.
Was The Blast a success as an
initial step in a program of or
ganized neighborliness? The Old
Boy thinks so.
And Kitchen expressed the opin
ion that future San Jose ex
change dances would meet with
even greater success. But this
opinion seems more in the realm
| of wishful thinking than of prob
! ability. About a week before The
i Blast, the "rumor spread over the |
campus that more than 1,000 ad
vance tickets had been sold to San •
Jose women. Less than half that
number were bought by Stanford
men; and yet, when they arrived
at Exhibition Hall, they found that
they still outnumbered the ladies, j
IF STANFORD men did not 1
I rise 1o the call of novelty, pub
! licity, and the prospect of a fa

vorable ratio, it seems doubtful
that they will do so in the future,
especially since the novelty is
gone and the ralio was a disap
pointment.
Finally the Chappie editor got
around to answering the crucial
question which has troubled many
a young lad and lass since the
Ratio was born: How are Stan
ford women different from other
college coeds, and does this differ
ence render them less socially at
tractive?
"The girls here are as attractive
as in any other college," said he.
"And they are more acute," he
added. (According to Webster's
Unabridged, "acute" can have sev
eral meanings: "ending in a sharp
point," "keen," "shrewd," or "hav
ing nice sensibilities." Take your
choice. . . .)
This interview ended two weeks
of inquiring into the semi-serious
joke which surrounds Stanford
women. Here are some random
conclusions:
The tradition of the bespecta
cled, bookworm ish S t anfo r d
Woman is largely a myth. The
Ratio is a problem which Stanford
men will continually have to face,
but which they will undoubtedly
survive.
THE PICTURE of Stanford as
a "social Sahara" is fairly foolish.
If anyone stops to consider the

frequent exchanges among living
groups; the almost nightly uni
versity-sponsored social and cul
tural opportunities; and the 21
fraternities, 7 eating clubs, and 16
Wilbur and Stern houses, all of
which are continually staging suc
cessful social functions both on
and off campus—he will see that
the Farm's social landscape is
anything but barren.
Naturally the women could
stand to re-evaluate some of their
attitudes. It is true that some of
them take their dates for granted.
And Ihe first word that the frosh
dolly adds to her collegiate vocab
ulary after she has acquired such
indispensable ones as "neat" and
"fink" is bound to be "dump." But
such practices are, after all, not
unique to Stanford.
The men have some interesting
attitudes too. For years and years
they have been laughing at Stan
ford women. But when a brash fe
; male has the nerve to try laughing
| back, they react with a storm of
righteous indignation.
In summary: the problem of the
Ratio and the complaints about
Stanford women are likely to be
with us as long as soap suds con
tinue to lather up the fountain on
Quad. So let's recognize the
humor of it; let's laugh at it and
at ourselves now and then; let's
be friends. . . .
