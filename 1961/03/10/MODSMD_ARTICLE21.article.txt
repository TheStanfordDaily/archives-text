Escondido Pace Track
It would seem that the Stanford
Police Department could find bet
ter use for its daylight activities
than harassing harried students
for parking in non-authorized
areas around the main campus.
While patrolling from the Chem
istry Building to Hoover Tower,
the police are missing the latest
on-eampus sport—the turning of
Escondido Road into a race track.
I Unfortunately, a school opened on
Escondido Road last fall and Es
condido Village parents fail to ap
preciate a n y 1 h i n g "sporting"
when lives of children are endan
gered.
The school student safety pa
trol stationed at the cross walk is
a rather small buffer between
safety of the children and the dan
ger of sports cars warming to
their task.
We admit that tagging law and
business school students for un
authorized parking in front of
their respective schools is a seri
ous business that should be ap
proached wilh the zeal of a dedi
cated law enforcement officer.
However, if the police could pos
sibly take just a few minutes off
to at least observe the Escondido
School area during the peak rush
hours, we don't feel it will deter
too greatly from their mission.
Opening of the school in the
morning — including the kinder
garten — coincides with Stan
ford's 9 a.m. classes and this is
the worse period. And, note that
the elementary classes let out for
the noon break at 12. At both
periods traffic resembles the last
lap at Indianapolis.

The loud applause for the mag
nanimous Stanford ATO chapter
should not deafen us to the essen
tial meaning of college fratern
ities.
Whether a particular fraternity
discriminates because of religion
or race is ultimately of far less
consequence than Ihe simple fact
that all college fraternities em
body the principle of discrimina
tion. Does it make very much dif
ference upon which particular ir
rational grounds the members of
a fraternity reject most of their
fellow students?
There may. perhaps, be more
direct roads to brotherhood than
ii lie narrowly exclusive paths of
limiling fraternities.

However, if the police could pos
sibly take just a few minutes off
to at least observe the Escondido
School area during the peak rush
hours, we don't feel it will deter
too greatly from their mission.
Opening of the school in the
morning — including the kinder
garten — coincides with Stan
ford's 9 a.m. classes and this is
the worse period. And, note that
the elementary classes let out for
the noon break at 12. At both
periods traffic resembles the last
lap at Indianapolis.

Exclusive Path
The loud applause for the mag
nanimous Stanford ATO chapter
should not deafen us to the essen
tial meaning of college fratern
ities.
Whether a particular fraternity
discriminates because of religion
or race is ultimately of far less
consequence than Ihe simple fact
that all college fraternities em
body the principle of discrimina
tion. Does it make very much dif
ference upon which particular ir
rational grounds the members of
a fraternity reject most of their
fellow students?
There may. perhaps, be more
direct roads to brotherhood than
ii lie narrowly exclusive paths of
limiling fraternities.

Escondido Pace Track
It would seem that the Stanford
Police Department could find bet
ter use for its daylight activities
than harassing harried students
for parking in non-authorized
areas around the main campus.
While patrolling from the Chem
istry Building to Hoover Tower,
the police are missing the latest
on-eampus sport—the turning of
Escondido Road into a race track.
I Unfortunately, a school opened on
Escondido Road last fall and Es
condido Village parents fail to ap
preciate a n y 1 h i n g "sporting"
when lives of children are endan
gered.
The school student safety pa
trol stationed at the cross walk is
a rather small buffer between
safety of the children and the dan
ger of sports cars warming to
their task.
We admit that tagging law and
business school students for un
authorized parking in front of
their respective schools is a seri
ous business that should be ap
proached wilh the zeal of a dedi
cated law enforcement officer.
However, if the police could pos
sibly take just a few minutes off

School area during the peak rush
