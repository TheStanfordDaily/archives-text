successful one by beating the Cal
Bears on tlie Stanford rugby field
tomorrow at 3 p.m.
In a preliminary contest, the
Tribe JV's will also be looking for

at 1:30.
THK CARD ruggers have not
beaten Coach "Doc" Hudson's
charges since 1953 and have suf
fered through 10 consecutive de
feats since that time.
Stanford was also the last col
lege team to hand the Berkeley
ites a rugby setback. The Big
Scrum .series currently stands at.
32 Bear wins, 11 Indian victories
and a tie way back in 1912.
Last Saturday in Berkeley's Me
morial Stadium, the Tribe saw its
eight-game winning streak go
down the drain as the Bear rugby
men put on a second half come
back to take a 6-5 decision.
Cal ace John Harrison, a big
lock from Sidney, Australia, did
all ihe damage for the Bears.
Booting 35- and 45-yard penalty
kicks, Harrison accounted for all
the Blue and Gold scoring.
HARRISON did more than just
score for the Bears. The Cal sixth
year man is the nucleus of a big
and strong Bear scrum that kept
the Indians from getting past mid
field in the second half of last
weekend's clash.
Dentist Hudson proclaims that |
with rookies like Pete Olson,
Larry Balliett, Alex Jamile and
Dave Hall, the exceptionally quick
hooker from South Africa, com
ing along fast the Bears should
extend their season's record to i
6-1-1 at the expense of the Indians.
But the Cards don't see it that :
way. Everyone, from Coach!
Kmetovic down to the last re
serve. is convinced that the Indi-1
ans should have won last week i
and is ready to see that the Bear
jinx lasts no longer.
WHILK confidently warning,
"We're ready for 'em," Kmetovic
adds that Stanford will have to
play its best rugby of the year to
beat Cal.
The Indians, boasting an 8-1
mark for the vear, will bo led into

the Bear fray by hooker Kyrk
Fteid. A graduate civil engineering
student, Reid is Stanford's leading
point-maker with 66 markers in
nine games.
Other stickouts for the Card
ruggers are Dick Hall, John
Clark, Tom McDonald and Troy
Barbee among the forwards and
Stan Lindskog, Rick McMillen
and Rod Sears in the backfield.
Previously scheduled for Stan
ford Stadium, the contest has been
transferred to the rugby field be
cause of the necessity of plowing
the Stadium turf.
ADMISSION will be charged

Stanford's rugby team will try
once again to make its season a
successful one by beating the Cal
Bears on tlie Stanford rugby field
tomorrow at 3 p.m.
In a preliminary contest, the
Tribe JV's will also be looking for
revenge against Ihe Bear jayvees
at 1:30.
THK CARD ruggers have not
beaten Coach "Doc" Hudson's
charges since 1953 and have suf
fered through 10 consecutive de
feats since that time.
Stanford was also the last col
lege team to hand the Berkeley
ites a rugby setback. The Big
Scrum .series currently stands at.
32 Bear wins, 11 Indian victories
and a tie way back in 1912.
Last Saturday in Berkeley's Me
morial Stadium, the Tribe saw its
eight-game winning streak go
down the drain as the Bear rugby
men put on a second half come
back to take a 6-5 decision.
Cal ace John Harrison, a big
lock from Sidney, Australia, did
all ihe damage for the Bears.
Booting 35- and 45-yard penalty
kicks, Harrison accounted for all
the Blue and Gold scoring.
HARRISON did more than just
score for the Bears. The Cal sixth
year man is the nucleus of a big
and strong Bear scrum that kept
the Indians from getting past mid
field in the second half of last
weekend's clash.
