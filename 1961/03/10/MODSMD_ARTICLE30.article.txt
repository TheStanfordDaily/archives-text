# Netters Face Two Tough Opponents
## 
### 
The Stanford tennis ream meets
Rcdlands University this after
noon at 2 on the Stanford courts.
The meet with the Olympic Club
which was cancelled last weekend
has been rescheduled and will be
played tomorrow morning at
10:00 at Stanford.
Coach Bob Renker is optimistic
about the meets but holds both of
the opponents in high regard. Ho
says, "Rcdlands always comes up
with a strong team."
The Olympic Club proved its
strength by beating the Cards 6-3
earlier in the season.
