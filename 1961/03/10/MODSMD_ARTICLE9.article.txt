# Morrell Named to Head Neurology Department
## 
### 
Dr. Frank Morrell, a leading
American neurologist, has been
appointed professor of medicine
and head of the division of neu
rology at Stanford School of
Medicine, according to Dean Rob
ert H. Alway.
In addition to post,
he will head the division of neu
rology at the Palo Alto-Stanford
Hospital Center.
Morrell is a former associate
professor of neurology and neuro
physiology at the University of
Minnesota. He received his A.B.
and M.D. degrees at Columbia
University, and an M.Sc. degree
at McGill University.
He is widely known for his stu
dies of epilepsy and for basin re
search on the molecular basis of
learning. Recently he has investi
gated the mechanism by which
single nerve cells in the brain re
ceive and store information.
His work offers the first con
crete evidence for the current
theory that memory is the im
printing of a code on complicated
molecules of a chemical called
ribonucleic acid (RNA).
