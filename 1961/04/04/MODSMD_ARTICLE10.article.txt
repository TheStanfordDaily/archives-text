# Reg Turnout Small-Heat Simmers Farm
## 
### 
A desire to spend Easter at
home or vacationing apparently
kept many Stanford students
away from the sun-baked Farm
yesterday as first day registration
figures showed an unusually
small number plunking down
their reg materials at the Pa
vilion.
Some 7,661 students registered,
an increase of only 140 from the
first day last spring quarter, and
Registrar Harvey Hall said the
number fell below what he had
expected.
HK SAII) final registration to
tals should show about 8,300-8,400
students enrolled this quarter.
The Ratio took an unfortunate,
temporary dip as only 1,824
women showed up to enroll—a
drop of 27 from the first day last
year.
But the men made up for this,
with 5,837 registering—l 67 above
last year.
Hall added that he expects a
big rush of business today as the
absentees begin to report in.
UNSEASONABLY hot weather
brought out summer frocks, ber
mudas and thongs yesterday as
the temperature rose to 85 on
campus, two degrees higher than
Sunday.
Smog clouded the air around
the Bay Area, however, and Los
Angeles had a high of 95—with
smog.
On another front, Charles Mc-
Laughlin reports that his senior
colloquia on American city
planning, originally set to met at
his home tonight, will not meet.
A bout with pneumonia has
forced him to postpone the first
class until next week, he said.

A desire to spend Easter at
home or vacationing apparently
kept many Stanford students
away from the sun-baked Farm
yesterday as first day registration
figures showed an unusually
small number plunking down
their reg materials at the Pa
vilion.
Some 7,661 students registered,
an increase of only 140 from the
first day last spring quarter, and
Registrar Harvey Hall said the
number fell below what he had
expected.
HK SAII) final registration to
tals should show about 8,300-8,400
students enrolled this quarter.
The Ratio took an unfortunate,
temporary dip as only 1,824
women showed up to enroll—a
drop of 27 from the first day last
year.
But the men made up for this,
with 5,837 registering—l 67 above
last year.
Hall added that he expects a
big rush of business today as the
absentees begin to report in.
UNSEASONABLY hot weather
brought out summer frocks, ber
mudas and thongs yesterday as
the temperature rose to 85 on
campus, two degrees higher than
Sunday.
Smog clouded the air around
the Bay Area, however, and Los
Angeles had a high of 95—with
smog.
On another front, Charles Mc-
Laughlin reports that his senior
colloquia on American city
planning, originally set to met at
his home tonight, will not meet.
A bout with pneumonia has
forced him to postpone the first
class until next week, he said.

A desire to spend Easter at
home or vacationing apparently
kept many Stanford students
away from the sun-baked Farm
yesterday as first day registration
figures showed an unusually
small number plunking down
their reg materials at the Pa
vilion.
Some 7,661 students registered,
an increase of only 140 from the
first day last spring quarter, and
Registrar Harvey Hall said the
number fell below what he had
expected.
HK SAII) final registration to
tals should show about 8,300-8,400
students enrolled this quarter.
The Ratio took an unfortunate,
temporary dip as only 1,824
women showed up to enroll—a
drop of 27 from the first day last
year.
But the men made up for this,
with 5,837 registering—l 67 above
last year.
Hall added that he expects a
big rush of business today as the
absentees begin to report in.
UNSEASONABLY hot weather
brought out summer frocks, ber
mudas and thongs yesterday as
the temperature rose to 85 on
campus, two degrees higher than
Sunday.
Smog clouded the air around
the Bay Area, however, and Los
Angeles had a high of 95—with
smog.
On another front, Charles Mc-
Laughlin reports that his senior
colloquia on American city
planning, originally set to met at
his home tonight, will not meet.
A bout with pneumonia has
forced him to postpone the first
class until next week, he said.

A desire to spend Easter at
home or vacationing apparently
kept many Stanford students
away from the sun-baked Farm
yesterday as first day registration
figures showed an unusually
small number plunking down
their reg materials at the Pa
vilion.
Some 7,661 students registered,
an increase of only 140 from the
first day last spring quarter, and
Registrar Harvey Hall said the
number fell below what he had
expected.
HK SAII) final registration to
tals should show about 8,300-8,400
students enrolled this quarter.
The Ratio took an unfortunate,
temporary dip as only 1,824
women showed up to enroll—a
drop of 27 from the first day last
year.
But the men made up for this,
with 5,837 registering—l 67 above
last year.
Hall added that he expects a
big rush of business today as the
absentees begin to report in.
UNSEASONABLY hot weather
brought out summer frocks, ber
mudas and thongs yesterday as
the temperature rose to 85 on
campus, two degrees higher than
Sunday.
Smog clouded the air around
the Bay Area, however, and Los
Angeles had a high of 95—with
smog.
On another front, Charles Mc-
Laughlin reports that his senior
colloquia on American city
planning, originally set to met at
his home tonight, will not meet.
A bout with pneumonia has
forced him to postpone the first
class until next week, he said.
