# 8-Story Apartments Set For SU Married Students
## 
### 
Stanford plans to construct a
group of eight-story apartment
buildings to house married stu
dents in Escondido Village within
the next 10 years, University offi
cials announced during vacation.
By tho time the project is com
pleted, nine eight-story buildings
with 1,000 apartment units will
loom over the southern part of
the campus.
Harry Sanders, director of Stan
ford planning, made plans public
at: a meeting of the Palo Alto
Planning Commission.
HE SAID three of the struc
tures will be finished in three
years and the Escondido Village
housing development will take its
final form in 10 years.
The village now has 250 apart
ments for married students, who
currently make up 25 per cent of
the University's 9.000 students.
And the number of students with
a spouse is growing each year,
Sanders said.
Each of the eight-story build
ings will contain 62 one-bedroom
apartments designed specifically
for couples with no children. The
tall buildings will be connectcd
with two-story buildings fur
nished with larger apartments for
families wtih children.
SANDERS reported the devel
opment. plans call for construc
tion of 400 additional apartment
units in Escondido Village in
three years. This would include
three of the eight-story apart
ments.
The big buildings will increase
the density of the village from the
current five families per acre to
17. The greater density is neces
sary to cope with the increased
demand for married housing, San
ders said.
Stanford plans 1o eliminate its
married student housing in Stan
ford Village by 1965.
THE THREE buildings going
up soon will be at least 800 feet
west of El Camino, parallel to the
highway. A landscaped area 300
feet wide will block the area from
El Camino. Another 300-foot land
scaped area will screen the devel
opment from Stanford Avenue.
The other six buildings will be
scattered in different parts of
Escondido Village and should be
up by 1971.
Sanders said an elaborate land
scaping scheme has been planned
to insure attractive surroundings
for the buildings.
THE NEW development will
present the problem of what
school the children of the married
students will attend, one Palo
Alto school official pointed out.
Sanders said a site on Stanford
Avenue behind the College Ter
race area has been tentatively re
served for school development.
He agreed that a third school,
in addition to the recently opened
Escondido elementary and older
Stanford elementary, will be
needed to serve Escondido and
Pino Hill, a subdivision for Stan
ford faculty and administration
members.

ford Village by 1965.
THE THREE buildings going
up soon will be at least 800 feet
west of El Camino, parallel to the
highway. A landscaped area 300
feet wide will block the area from
El Camino. Another 300-foot land
scaped area will screen the devel
opment from Stanford Avenue.
The other six buildings will be
scattered in different parts of
Escondido Village and should be
up by 1971.
Sanders said an elaborate land
scaping scheme has been planned
to insure attractive surroundings
for the buildings.
THE NEW development will
present the problem of what
school the children of the married
students will attend, one Palo
Alto school official pointed out.
Sanders said a site on Stanford
Avenue behind the College Ter
race area has been tentatively re
served for school development.
He agreed that a third school,
in addition to the recently opened
Escondido elementary and older
Stanford elementary, will be
needed to serve Escondido and
Pino Hill, a subdivision for Stan
ford faculty and administration
members.
Stanford plans to construct a
group of eight-story apartment
buildings to house married stu
dents in Escondido Village within
the next 10 years, University offi
cials announced during vacation.
By tho time the project is com
pleted, nine eight-story buildings
with 1,000 apartment units will
loom over the southern part of
the campus.
Harry Sanders, director of Stan
ford planning, made plans public
at: a meeting of the Palo Alto
Planning Commission.
HE SAID three of the struc
tures will be finished in three
years and the Escondido Village
housing development will take its
final form in 10 years.
The village now has 250 apart
ments for married students, who
currently make up 25 per cent of
the University's 9.000 students.
And the number of students with
a spouse is growing each year,
Sanders said.
Each of the eight-story build
ings will contain 62 one-bedroom
apartments designed specifically
for couples with no children. The
tall buildings will be connectcd
with two-story buildings fur
nished with larger apartments for
families wtih children.
SANDERS reported the devel
opment. plans call for construc
tion of 400 additional apartment
units in Escondido Village in
three years. This would include
three of the eight-story apart
ments.
The big buildings will increase
the density of the village from the
current five families per acre to
17. The greater density is neces
sary to cope with the increased
demand for married housing, San
ders said.
