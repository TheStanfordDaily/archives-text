# Fraternities Now Lead University
## 
### 
With the start of fraternity rush, it will do the freshmen well to
look at the accomplishments and vitality of Stanford fraternities —
whether or not they believe they wish to join. For these accomplish
ments do exist despite the discordant harpings of a large percentage
of the faculty and a general misunderstanding of the fraternity sys
tem, as it exists at Stanford, by the general public.
In the last five years the fraternities have moved, in the words of
Prof. Stone, a Faculty Resident at Stern Hall, to become "a direct
extension of the educational process and not something different
from or merely tangential to it." This has been done by the fraterni
ties adopting Dr. Stone's plan of faculty associates, first used in the
Stern Houses, to the fraternties. Now most of the fraternities have or
are seeking both junior and senior faculty members who eat and
talk on a regular basis with members of the house, bringing the Uni
versity's intellectual climate into the fraternity residence. In addition,
Stanford fraternities by their policy of pledging the man regardless
of race or religion, plus the inclusion of many foreign students into
the fraternity, have become cosmopolitan. Here students from diver
gent backgrounds can learn of each other in an atmosphere which
binds real friendships.
This does not suggest that fraternities are perfect. Although hyper
sensitive to criticism, the fraternities, more than any other living
groups, are laboring to improve themselves. The fraternity grade
point, long below the all-men's average, has risen steadily in the
past few years, until Autumn Quarter it was above the all-men's
average. Hazing, officially abolished by the Interfratemity Council
a year ago, is now actually being abolished. And the violations for
rowdiness and obscene behavior are on the downturn, most of them
being attributed to a very small group of houses.
Fraternities have ceased becoming merely hangers-on to Uni
versity life. They are now the leaders of student University life and
as such deserve attention not only by the freshmen, but also by the
faculty. With such potentiality, faculty members who refuse to have
anything to do with fraternities either on an occasional or regular
basis are cutting the tangent which connects the fraternity to the
academic sector of Stanford.

Stanford fraternities by their policy of pledging the man regardless
of race or religion, plus the inclusion of many foreign students into
the fraternity, have become cosmopolitan. Here students from diver
gent backgrounds can learn of each other in an atmosphere which
binds real friendships.
This does not suggest that fraternities are perfect. Although hyper
sensitive to criticism, the fraternities, more than any other living
groups, are laboring to improve themselves. The fraternity grade
point, long below the all-men's average, has risen steadily in the
past few years, until Autumn Quarter it was above the all-men's
average. Hazing, officially abolished by the Interfratemity Council
a year ago, is now actually being abolished. And the violations for
rowdiness and obscene behavior are on the downturn, most of them
being attributed to a very small group of houses.
Fraternities have ceased becoming merely hangers-on to Uni
versity life. They are now the leaders of student University life and
as such deserve attention not only by the freshmen, but also by the
faculty. With such potentiality, faculty members who refuse to have
anything to do with fraternities either on an occasional or regular
basis are cutting the tangent which connects the fraternity to the
academic sector of Stanford.
