# Peace Corps Should Adopt Loyalty Oath
## 
### 
Mr. Sargent Shriver, director of the Peace Corps, has shown hard
thinking in his statement that all corpsmen sent overseas will be sub
ject to a security check to prevent Communist infiltration. As Sena
tor Hugh Scott said on a recent radio-television program, the Peace
Corps is an emotionally attractive program and one which the Com
munists would be likely to infiltrate. A Shriver-sponsored security
check either by the FBI or another security organization will remove
a doubt of this happening.
Mr. Shriver, however, has not yet made clear his position on a
loyalty oath for the Corps.
The students of the National Conference on Youth Service Abroad
sponsored by the National Students Association, in arguing against
a loyalty oath showed their idealism—but not much realism. In their
resolution they declared, "A corpsman will not be a political agent
and should not be required to make any particular affirmation of
loyalty beyond the standard passport requirements for any Ameri
can traveling abroad."
Fuzzy thinking like this is unrealistic. Peace Corps members are
United States citizens, representing the United States government in
an official capacity. As such they are political, whether they like it
or not, just as much as the armed forces or the diplomatic corps—
both of which take loyalty oaths. There is no reason why Peace Corps
members should not do likewise.
