Hotel Stern
The other night at Stern Hall
we witnessed an event which we
are sure is not typical of Stanford
dormitories, but which we feel
should be brought to the atten
tion of the University community.
We asked some student residents
if they could give us information
as to the whereabouts of a visitor
who was staying there. They said
that the RA would not know, and
that the visitor was one of "a lot
of people the University sticks on
us. They use this place like a
hotel." The visitor we were call
ing for is Professor of Political
Economy at the University of
Warsaw, and one of the top men
in the economic planning board of
Poland.
If this case is at all widespread,
the Stanford students living in the
dormitories are certainly (1) not
being good hosts to visitors, and
(2) missing an opportunity which
simply cannot be duplicated.
We are not sure of the relation
ship which is supposed to exist
between the students and the

guests. If thiÂ« situation of indif
ference is supposed to exist, we
think that the University should
reconsidor the policy of placing
visitors in dormitories. If. on the
other hand, there is supposed to
be some communication between
the visitors and students, then we
think that the RA's, the admin
istration, and the students should
try to increase the mutual bene
fit to visitors and hosts.
