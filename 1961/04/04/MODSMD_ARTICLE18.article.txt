# Finishing Schools
## 
### 
I would propose that there be
instituted at Stanford a course in
etiquette for Stanford girls, to
teach them how to talk, how to
walk, how to dress, and how to
act in front of men.
The products of finishing
schools and Eastern girls colleges
may not all be women. But they
do a much better job of playing
the part.
