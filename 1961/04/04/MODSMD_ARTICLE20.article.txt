## OECD Treaty Makes U.S. Partner in Economics 
### 
Except for Sen. Capehart, who
did not vote, the Foreign Rela
tions Committee is unanimously
in favor of the trealy whieh will
make this country a member of
OECD (The Organization for Eco
nomic Cooperation and Develop
ment). The Senate Committee
has, however, attached to its re
port an "interpretation and expla
nation" of the intent of the Sen
ate. Nothing in the treaty gives
the Executive any power "beyond
what the President now has." The
interpretation is undoubtedly cor
rect. It is surely quite harmless.

It is also quite
unnecessary, as
a reading of the
treaty, particu
larly Article VI,
will show.
Nothing can
be recommended
or decided by the
Organization ex
, cept by unani
!mo us consent .
That is to say,

each member has a veto. More
over. no decision shall be binding
on any Member until it has com
plied with the requirements of its
own constitutional procedures."
The rights of Congress are wholly
safeguarded.
THUS, IN no sense of the word
is the OECD a supra-national or

ganization which can override the
sovereign power of any nation.
What then is it? And why is it
important ?
The best way to get at what it
is is to begin by noting that today,
without the treaty, the President
has the constitutional power to
do all that the treaty proposes
(hat he should do. The treaty
commits 18 West European coun
tries plus Canada and the U.S.A.
to consult.
They are to consult in order to
cooperate for economic stability
and growth and in assisting the
under-developed countries. The
President already has the power,
if he chooses to use it, to consult
with other governments on all of
these subjects.
IF OUT OF these consultations
come proposals requiring specific
actions, the President must go
back to Congress unless the ac
tion has already been authorized.
He can spend no money that is
not appropriated, he can make no
loans that are not authorized, he
can change no tariff schedule ex
cept as authorized under the
Trade Agreement s Act.
Why then is it important to
establish in a solemn treaty the
commitment to consult? It; is im
portant because in committing
ourselves to consult, we receive
the commitment of the 19 other
nations which comprise all the
great economic powers of the non-
Communist world except, for
Japan. Japan is now a member of
the Development Assistance
Group dealing with the underde
veloped countries and may join
the OECD.
In return for our commitment
to consult with them, we get the
right to be consulted by them.
This is a valuable right as has
been shown by the still uncom
pleted negotiations with West
Germany, as will be shown in the
forthcoming discussions about
the trade policies of the Common
Market countries and the nations
of the European Free Trade Area.
IT IS HIGHLY significant that
this treaty was negotiated and
signed by the Eisenhower admin
istration. and that: it is being rati
fied under the Kennedy admin

istration. This shows that before
the change of Administration the
need which the treaty meets had
become clear to President Eisen
hower, Mr. Herter, and Mr. Dillon,
rt had become clear that with tho
phenomenal economic recovery of
Western Europe, in which this
country played an historic part,
our relations with Western Eu
rope were greatly altered.
At the time of the Marshall
Plan in 1948 the relations between
West Europe and the U.S.A. were
those of beneficiary and patron,
protected and protector.
With European recovery.
1 hough we are still the biggest
economic power, ihe relationship
is mutual as between equals. In
stead of the patron and the pro
tector. we are the partner, and to
conserve and promote our inter
ests, we need to have recognized,
as this treaty does, our right to
participate in the discussions, to
be consulted, to be fully informed,
and to be listened to in the field of
high international economic pol
icy.
IN THE TIME of the Marshall
Plan we had the power of the
last word. Since the European re
covery we shall have in an organ
ization like the OECD the influ
ence which stems from our size,
our economic importance, and the
enlightenment of our policy.
It is a sign of the times, a very
good sign, it seems to me, that we
shall be ratifying this treaty not
as a favor to our friends handed
down from above, but because
this treaty provides us with a re
spectable, a recognized, and an
orderly instrument for defending
our rights and promoting our in
terests.
