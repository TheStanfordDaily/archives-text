## Liberals Happier Than Ever 
### 
I wrote this sort of thing the
other clay on the John Birch So
ciety. Which is more right-wing
than a fruitcake. Only I hope no
one thinks I'm against it.
I'm for everybody saying what
they want. As long as they don't
try to do what they have in mind.
Which is rare. And besides, it's
good to see the Liberals happy
again.
I've never seen the Liberals so
happy. Mr. Mosk, our Liberal in
vestigating the Society because
he thinks it may be "subversive."
And Our Governor, Mr. Brown,
says happily the Society might
well be investigated by the Un-
American Activities Committees.
Of which we have so many.
SO UP IN Sacramento, here's
Assemblyman Lou Francis going
around somberly investigating all
the Communists in Humboldt
County. And all the Liberals are
going around happily investi
gating Mr. Francis. To see if he's
a member of the John Birch So
ciety.
Mr. Francis says he is not now
nor has he ever been a member.
And the Liberals say thoy can't
make up their minds whether he's
a card-carrying member, a fellow
traveler. or a John Birch dupe.
I've got. one Liberal friend who
says happily: "If it walks like a
duck and talks like a duck, I say it
is a duck." Which sounds fa
miliar.
Only I'm getting worried. If the
Un-American people start, an in
vestigation, they'll get lots of pub
licity. And pretty soon they'll
stack their meetings wilh left
wing sympathizers. And a lot of
students will get mad because
they can't get in and they'll all
be washed down the City Hall
steps.
SO THE COMMITTEE will pro
duce a film called "Operation Ab
solution." Which will prove sev
eral known John Birchers were
among the students. Mainly be
cause they were subpoenaed. And
we'll have to go through that all
over again.
And the first thing we know,
liberal commentators like Fulton
Steamboat Jr. will be saying: "I
can't definitely prove definitely
that he's a card-carrying John
Bircher. But there's no question
he's one of those anti-ant i John
Birchers." Which proves Mr.
Steamboat is a loyal anti-anti-anti
Bircher.
Right now, I'm just an anti
anti-anti-anti-Communist;. And I
don't think I could face becoming
an anti-anti-anti-anti-Bircher too.
I think I'll just become anti
people who want to investigate
other people for what they think.
Instead of what they do. People
have got enough trouble thinking
as it is. I think.
