### 
Stanford's "finest in years" freshman track team puts its reputa
tion on the line today when it meets Harnell and Menlo Junior Col
leges at Stanford's Angell Field at 4 p.m.
"We'll know a lot more about the team after we see it against
some competition," says Coach Payton Jordan, "but from what

they've done so far in practice
and informal competition, ihe
group looks like it intends to live
up to advance billing."
BILL PRATT, a half-miler and
miler from Wenatchee, Wash., al
ready has shaved his 880 time to
1:52.6, well under the 1:54.5 frosh
record set in 1958 by Jeff Beau
baire and tied in 1959 by present
varsity co-captain Rich Klier.
Some of the frosh participated
in the Stanford Relays at Spartan
Stadium last month and Pratt,
Rich Chesarek, Dave Stone, and
Dave Boore won the distance med
ley relay in 10:24.8.
Shotputter Steve Arch from
Reno took fourth at San Jose with
a 51-8% toss, but was the top
Stanford man in the competition.
His effort put him less than two
inches away from Bob Atkinson's
frosh record of 51-10 1 :> set three
years ago.
COACH JORDAN reports that
Steve Cortright of Long Beach
and Mike Wa 11 on are looking
sharp in the hurdles.
