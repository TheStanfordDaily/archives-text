## Ruggers Champs at Monterey 
### 
The Stanford rugby leam ended
its regular season on a sweet note
March 24 and 25 by adding the
Monterey Tournament champion
ships to its impressive list of
laurels.
Coach Pete Kmetovic's scrum
climaxed a brilliant season as it
defeated four opponents at Car
mel-by-the-Sea, edging the Trojans
of USC in the regulation final 6-3.
TWENTY-ONE teams played in
the two-day tourney, but the
strong University of California
Bears did not compete. Cal was
the only team to blemish the Card
ten-game schedule, but the loss
was later reversed.
Stanford defeated the South
Coast Club, 12-3. and the Univer
sities Club of Oakland, 5-0, in 20-
minute skirmishes. The game with
the Universities Club was a thrill
er with the Indians winning it in
a 5-minute overtime session.
THE SEMI-FINALS saw the
men from Palo Alto trounce Mera
loma of Vancouver 10-0. Meraloma
had ended the Cards' title hopes
at Monterey in last year's semi
final round.
The highly successful rugby
season may not have ended for
the Stanford scrum. Champions of
the Northern California Rugby
Union and the Monterey Tourna
ment title holder, the Card team
has been invited to compete in a
North-South All-Star game in
about two weeks.
