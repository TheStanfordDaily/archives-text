# Atom Smasher Money Asked By President
## 
### 
President Kennedy has asked
Congress to appropriate funds for
constructing the proposed SI 14
million Project M (for Monster)
atom smasher at Stanford.
Former- President Eisenhower
had included the linear electron
accelerator in his budget message
for the past three years. Congress
never passed the appropriation,
apparently due to some Demo
cratic Party opposition.
CONGRESSMAN Charles Gub
ser, R-Calif., says Kennedy's back
ing of Project M indicates it will
be supported by both Republican
and Democratic members of Con
gress.
The accelerator, for high ener
gy physics research, would be the
largest and most powerful in the
world. It would be housed in an
underground tunnel in the foot
hills south of Sand Hill Road.
E 1 e c t r on s would travel the
length of the atom smasher tube,
crashing at the speed of light into
other atomic particles to produce
known particles of matter and
perhaps some new ones.
BEFORE Congress can appro
priate the money, the Joint Com
mittee on Atomic Energy must
authorize construction. Last year
the committee withheld approval
but recommended $3 million for
plans. At that time, observers pre
dicted Congress would approve
construction this year.
In his budget message, Kennedy
said accelerator funds were
among the omissions in Eisenhow
er's budget that made it falsely
appear balanced.
