Lucky Strike presents the contest to end ail contests! I
WiN THE SML
Dr. Frood presented the automobile industry with this magnificent I|| J
pre-compact. Hurt and disillusioned because the auto industry
preferred to develop their own compact, FROOD NOW OFFERS HIS
CAR TO SOME LUCKY COLLEGE STUDENT! This is a brand-new, gas-driven, REAL CAR. It features
four (4) wheels, genuine foot-power brakes, "fresh-air conditioning," and actual left-right
steering mechanism! The economical 7.9 horsepower engine saves you hundreds of dollars
in hay and oats! Goes 32 miles per hour, gets up to 65 miles per gallon. The Froodmobile can be
licensed in every state except New Jersey. (New Jersey hates Frood.) WIN this beautiful
car (with "FROODMOBILE"mounted in brass on the cowl!). Actual value over $1,000.
