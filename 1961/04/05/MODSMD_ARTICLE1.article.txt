# Socialist Requests 'Moral Indignations'
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
Some intelligently channeled "moral indignation" against injus
tice and a radical consideration of the way we manage democracy
are needed to challenge this materialist civilization, Socialist Nor
man Thomas told a near-capacity audience in Cubberley Audi-

torium yesterday.
Thomas decried the lack of
moral indignation in American
universities and colleges during
his talk, "The Need for a Now
Radicalism," sponsored by Politi
cal Union.
STUDENTS LEARN that the
Civil War was caused by extrem
ists of both the North and South,
but they seem to consider the ex
tremists for civil rights no better
than the other extreme, he said.
From reading about discrimina-1
tion in the South, one may wonder |
if the North really won the war, j
Thomas said. Even in Northern,
cities, economic conditions make i
for segregation, he said.
NO END is found to discrimi
nation just by concentrating on
economic problems, though; there
are still problems of 'race rela
tions in unions, Thomas said.
Socialists were mistaken in be
lieving that the plain people are
fonder of civil liberties than the
people higher up in the socio-eco
nomic scale.and the reverse seems
to be true according to Thomas.
The automatic socialism that
according to Marx was supposed
to come in an inevitable progres
sion from capitalism is not being
fulfilled, he said. We live in a |
culture of conspicuous waste; the
workers have grown up in it and I
share it, he said.
THOMAS CALLED for a use j
of technology for blessings of!
mankind in health and education (
rather than for wasteful expendi
ture. He said although automa
tion is one cause of unemploy
ment problems, we can't go back
to an age of handcraft, and we
need to embrace the philosophy I
that we are compelled to go on
living in a world of specialization
and enforced cooperation.
A re-evaluation of what ought
to be socially owned is needed, he
said. According to Thomas, slums
have not been replaced as they
should partly because the land
price is so high due to the social
creation of rental value of land.
Dwindling natural resources
should be publicly owned, Thomas
said, decrying the principle that
pays a man for oil on his land
that he neither created nor dis
covered.
POLITICAL parties need a co
herent philosophy of who should
own what, whether the economic
system should be based on private
property or general need and how
much democracy there should be
in industry and how it should be
exercised, he said.
Thomas objected to debating
issues in term of what he con
sidered outdated concepts, declar
ing that use of the term 'free
enterprise" isn't realistic. "Free
enterprise means to an American
that no one ought to be subsi
dized except the industry in which
he works," Thomas quipped.
Big lists of subsidized indus
tries, war contracts awarded i
without free competitive bidding
and examples of widespread price-!
fixing in corporations show con
ditions completely contrary to any
doctrine of free enterprise, but
people still use that kind of lan
guage, Norman asserted.

From reading about discrimina-1
tion in the South, one may wonder |
if the North really won the war, j
Thomas said. Even in Northern,
cities, economic conditions make i
for segregation, he said.
NO END is found to discrimi
nation just by concentrating on
economic problems, though; there
are still problems of 'race rela
tions in unions, Thomas said.
Socialists were mistaken in be
lieving that the plain people are
fonder of civil liberties than the
people higher up in the socio-eco
nomic scale.and the reverse seems
to be true according to Thomas.
The automatic socialism that
according to Marx was supposed
to come in an inevitable progres
sion from capitalism is not being
fulfilled, he said. We live in a |
culture of conspicuous waste; the
workers have grown up in it and I
share it, he said.
THOMAS CALLED for a use j
of technology for blessings of!
mankind in health and education (
rather than for wasteful expendi
ture. He said although automa
tion is one cause of unemploy
ment problems, we can't go back
to an age of handcraft, and we
need to embrace the philosophy I
that we are compelled to go on
living in a world of specialization
and enforced cooperation.
A re-evaluation of what ought
to be socially owned is needed, he
said. According to Thomas, slums
have not been replaced as they
should partly because the land
price is so high due to the social
creation of rental value of land.
Dwindling natural resources
should be publicly owned, Thomas
said, decrying the principle that
pays a man for oil on his land
that he neither created nor dis
covered.
POLITICAL parties need a co
herent philosophy of who should
own what, whether the economic
system should be based on private
property or general need and how
much democracy there should be
in industry and how it should be
exercised, he said.
Thomas objected to debating
issues in term of what he con
sidered outdated concepts, declar
ing that use of the term 'free
enterprise" isn't realistic. "Free
enterprise means to an American
that no one ought to be subsi
dized except the industry in which
he works," Thomas quipped.
Big lists of subsidized indus
tries, war contracts awarded i
without free competitive bidding
and examples of widespread price-!
fixing in corporations show con
ditions completely contrary to any
doctrine of free enterprise, but
people still use that kind of lan
guage, Norman asserted.
Some intelligently channeled "moral indignation" against injus
tice and a radical consideration of the way we manage democracy
are needed to challenge this materialist civilization, Socialist Nor
man Thomas told a near-capacity audience in Cubberley Audi-

torium yesterday.
Thomas decried the lack of
moral indignation in American
universities and colleges during
his talk, "The Need for a Now
Radicalism," sponsored by Politi
cal Union.
STUDENTS LEARN that the
Civil War was caused by extrem
ists of both the North and South,
but they seem to consider the ex
tremists for civil rights no better
than the other extreme, he said.
