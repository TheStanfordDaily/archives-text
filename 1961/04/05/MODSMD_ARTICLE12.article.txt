# ATO's as Local Should Prosper
## 
### 
Regretfully, the local chapter of Alpha Tau Omega and the Uni
versity have chosen not to accept Attorney General Stanley Mosk's
offer to go to court over the withdrawal of the chapter's charter
by the national. Such action, if successful, would have immensely
helped the Stanford fraternities fight to rid their charters of discrimi
natory race and religious clauses.
However, the decision to go local has been made. According
to President Mike Kavanaugh the chapter will rush under the name
of Alpha Tau Omega this spring in order to enable this year's
pledge class to help choose the new name. This is sound reason
ing, for a local fraternity at Stanford should be a roaring success—
if it follows the pattern of locals at eastern colleges.
At both Dartmouth and Amherst nationals have gone local over
reasons similar to the Stanford ATO's and remained potent despite
a lack of national affiliation. Nationals turned locals remained strong
if they were strong before; remained weak if they were weak be
fore the change.
And too, those who would have the Stanford ATO's pick up
another national affiliation forget that they would be forsaking a
loyal alumni which has been active in support of the chapter's stand
—and which will be needed to help build the new fraternity
clusters. Some Row rebels, of course, see the local as a University
master plan to gradually—and somehow mysteriously—make all
Stanford fraternities local. Such nonsense seems rather farfetched.
It does not add that the University would withdraw the charters of
Stanford fraternities after the alumni had just donated 3150,000 per
fraternity for the construction of a new cluster.
But as for the local ATO's—the freshman should not fear the
local going extinct. With the chapter's past history of fighting for
what it believes and with the record of successful locals at eastern
colleges, the chapter looks like it will continue to prosper.
