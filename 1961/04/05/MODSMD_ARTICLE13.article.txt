man Les Roos, has compiled various facts and figures on the species
known as the "Stanford Professors." Here we find that Prof. Doug
las Lawrence of the Psychology Department enjoys playing the
game of "Go"; that Prof. William McCord, Assistant Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, was a psychological counselor at San Quen
tin Prison; that History Prof. John Miller enjoys sailing at his sum
mer home in Washington. In addition the informative book, bound
by a clever cartoon cover by Daily artist Dick Bibler, gives perti
nent facts about the professors' and administrators' education and j
honors. And for the senior women—the book tells whether their |
favorites are married. j'
Mr. Roos and his committee have done a solid service to the
Stanford community by preparing a book which helps humanize
the professors into individuals as well as providing their academic
background. As a bridge between the sometimes-gulf of misun- |
derstanding between faculty and students it deserves the support .
of the Stanford student body. The book will be on sale the remainder |
of the week.
