Totally False
In the Daily of April 4, my
name was used in an editorial
praising fraternities. One state
ment read: "In the last five years
the fraternities have moved, in
the words of Prof. Stone, a Fac
ulty Resident at Stern Hall, to be
come 'a direct extension of the ed
ucational proces and not some
thing from or merely tangential
to it.' "
That statement is totally false.
When I wrote the words quoted
above (in a brochure about the
Stanford House Plan) I was not
referring to fraternities at all.
but to the House Plan. And 1 am
very far from claiming, or cheer
fully letting the Daily Editor
claim, that they are as applicable
to the one way of life as to the
other.
Lately fraternities have elimi
nated some of their more flagrant
discriminatory practices; they are
less resistant to the intellectual
life of ihe University than they
used to be; and they are some
what less tribal in their cultural
habits. But that they "have moved
to become" (whatever that
strange syntax may mean) a 'di
rect extension of the educational
process' is something I never said
or would say. However, one ra
tionalizes, fraternities are still
primarily social and only inci
dentally intellectual institutions.

And the heart of thoir life is still i
based on a policy of exclusion and |
discrimination. Is it so different j
that they now let in a few Jews j
and Negroes and Orientals but
still keep out, as always, the "tur-
I keys"?
The Daily Editor yanked my
statement out of context and used
it to support a contention almost
! opposite to my own. This is dis
honest — or at least extremely
j careless — journalism. At the
i close of my raided article, I stated
i that the House Plan differed from
I fraternities and eating clubs on
j an important matter of principle:
it held that the man should choose
the house and not the house the
man. Until fraternities are ready
to adopt that principle, I must
i protest that any words I utter
I about the House Plan are not in
terchangeable with statements
about fraternities.

Lately fraternities have elimi

less resistant to the intellectual

used to be; and they are some

to become" (whatever that
strange syntax may mean) a 'di

primarily social and only inci

The Daily Editor yanked my

it held that the man should choose
