### KEN DERY, Sports Editor 
Two of the strongest college track outfits in the country invade
Stanford Stadium this Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Loaded with individual
talent the Spartans of San Jose State and the Sooners from the
University of Oklahoma will tackle Coach Payton Jordan's thin but
game sguad.
The Cards have already been defeated twice by Coach Bud

I Winter's fine San Jose team and
the clash with Oklahoma is ex-
I pected to be rough.
LKADINO the men from Nor
man is senior co-captain J. D.
i Martin. Martin is the National
| Collegiate pole vaulting champ,
| winning with a leap of 14-9.
The 6-4, 195-pounder is extreme
ly strong and was an Oklahoma
hero last year as a junior. He
valuted over the 15-foot level in
10 of his 16 appearances.
Martin soared to a world record
of 15-9 :! 4 in a quadrangular out
j door meet last year but that mark
| wasn't officially accepted because
one of the vaulting standard's
pegs was tunned opposite the
other standard's pegs so the cross
■ bar wouldn't be blown off by an
j estimated 20 mph wind.
TO GIVK some idea to his class
one only has to look at his top
1 mark as a sophomore. No second-
I year collegian has ever gone as
i high as his 15-3 'U.
J. D. cleared 15-3 last week and
just missed a world record try at
I 15-10.
i
Mike Lindsay, from London,
I England, is the other Sooner co
i captain. He snared both the Big
i Eight indoor and outdoor shot-put
| crowns in 1959 and 1960 and also
: finished second in the discus
i hole I only outdoors) in both of
those years.
The big senior's top mark in the
I shot is 58-6 U and he has spun
i the discus 181-6'2.
I COACII WINTKR of San Jose
I State for the second straight year
! finds himself blessed with iho
! outstanding sprinter in the na-
I tion. Last year it was Ray Norton,
I the lithe, smooth-gliding Negro.

This season it is Dennis Johnson
from Jamiaca.
In his first three weeks of big
time competition Johnson has
twice tieri the world standard for
the 100-yard dash. His clockings
of .09.3 have been brilliant for this
early in the season and both Win
ter and Jordan feel that "this
might be the week" for a new
world record.
Johnson's effort achieved last
Saturday at Stanford Stadium
will never become official for an
anemometer, for measuring the
breeze, was not employed by the
officials. This week the wind
guage will be on hand.
IN ADDITION to the fast-fly
ing Johnson, San Jose boasts one
of the top weight men on the
coast in Dan Studney.
Studney spun the discus 168-7 3 .1
last week to finish but a scant
two yards behind Stanford's Dave
Weill.
In the javelin event the 6-3, 205-
pounder hurled 232-4 1 n to lead all
of the competition,
Expected to add to the drama
of the pole vault event are Spar
tans Jeff Chase. Rich Kimmell
and Dick Gear. Chase won last
week with a vault of 14-S while
Kimmell and Gear deadlocked
with Stanford's Phil White at
14-4.
These four are all fierce com
petitors and the atmosphere sur

rounding this event just might
push Martin to a new world's
record.

This season it is Dennis Johnson
from Jamiaca.
In his first three weeks of big
time competition Johnson has
twice tieri the world standard for
the 100-yard dash. His clockings
of .09.3 have been brilliant for this
early in the season and both Win

world record.
Johnson's effort achieved last
Saturday at Stanford Stadium

anemometer, for measuring the

officials. This week the wind

IN ADDITION to the fast-fly
ing Johnson, San Jose boasts one
