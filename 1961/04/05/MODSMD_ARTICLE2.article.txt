j ELISABETH VILLE, Katanga,
The Congo (UPI > — A mob of
| 10,000 howling Katangese, armed
| with machetes, iron bars and an
| cient muzzle-loading rifles, yester
i day seized Elisabethville Airport
from Swedish United Nations
| troops.
Katanga's police force, ordered
into action by its white officers,
kept the mob from reaching the
Swedes, who stood shoulder to
shoulder, bayonets fixed, as the
! Katangese surged around the air
port buildings.
BY NIGHTFALL, Elisabeth
ville was reported calm, but at
; least 10 U.N. soldiers were in
jured in incidents throughout the
day.
The mob, fired up by a virtual
i declaration of war on the United
Nations issued in a speech by
j Katanga President Moi s e
j Tshombe, withdrew after U.N. of
l ficials bowed to an ultimatum
: that they continue to share con
j trol of the airport with the Ka
tanga government.
(At U.N. headquarters in New
York, the airport incident was re
j ferred to as a "jostling match"
and the United Nations was said
to be satisfied with the status
quo agreement which was de
scribed "as a return to the normal
situation, which we always found
I
satisfactory. )
SWEDISH soldiers captured
the field Monday night from a Ka
tanga unit.
There were unconfirmed, re
ports that several Swedes were
arrested yesterday in reprisal.
These other incidents involving
Europeans were reported:
• A crowd chased three Euro
peans through city streets until
stopped by the police.
• Natives stoned the U.N. dis
pensary, staffed by Italians.
• African youths molested sev
eral other Europeans.
Tshombe's speech gave the
United Nations two hours to clear
out of the airfield. The crowd
then turned and headed for it.
