"India is going in the right direction," Mrs. Lakshmi Menon, dep
uty minister of external affairs for India, stated as the thesis of her
speech for the Tuesday Evening Series, "Whither India," last night.
Mrs. Menon feels that often Western countries have little under
standing of the Indian's point of view in administration, and she

presented India's domestic and
foreign policies.
WHILE other countries, such
as the United States .suspect a
trend toward Communism in
India, she emphasized that this
is confused with India's socialism.
The state controls the basic in
dustries, she explained, but there
was much nationalization of in
dustries long before India became
free from the British.
Great improvements have been
made in India since their inde
pendence in 1947, she pointed out.
They have had two elections in
which a great number of people
voted.
THE Administration is stable
and does not operate for the ad
vantage of a few, but for the gen
eral welfare. Resources have been
further developed by the planned
economy, but always democratic
freedom is combined with their
policies, she said.
"There has been a great change
in attitude in the people," she
said. Now there is a national civil
court, and civil law applies to all
citizens. Before 1947 there was no
single legal code for Hindu minor
ity groups.
"We are accused of leaning to
ward Communism," she said in
regard to India's foreign policy of
non-alignment, and added that
India also is accused of taking
aid from all countries while
preaching morality to all. She em
phasized that India, like any other
country, wants to pursue its own
interests.
"WE ARE very keen that the
United Nations should be made
strong," she said, but she felt that
other countries should judge
India by the broad principles of
the United Nations, rather* than
specific instances of Indian policy
decisions. She pointed out that
when India votes with Russia, she
is accused of Communism, but if
she votes with the United States
she is not noticed. She said that
India looks at issues independent
ly of the two other countries.
Rod China should be admitted
to the United Nations, she said,
in order for the United Nations
to be a i*eal peace agent. In an
swer to the opinion of many
countries that Red China is not
peace-loving, she said. "I can
point out at least 50 countries in
Ihe United Nations who do not
love peace for its own sake . . ."
In reference to the border dispute
between India and China, she de
clared 1 hat many border disputes
go unnoticed, such as the dispute
between India and Pakistan.
"WE ARE not afraid of any
ideologies, nol of Communism."
she said, for to the ordinary
Hindu, coexistence is a matter of
daily experience, with the many
different creeds in India.
"Communism ideology is taught
in all universities." she said,
along with many other ideologies.
It is only by knowing them thai
the strengths and weaknesses are
known, she stated, and .said that
this is one of the disai*vantages of
the Untied States underground
Communist Parly.

India by the broad principles of
the United Nations, rather* than
specific instances of Indian policy
decisions. She pointed out that
when India votes with Russia, she
is accused of Communism, but if
she votes with the United States

India looks at issues independent
ly of the two other countries.
Rod China should be admitted
to the United Nations, she said,
in order for the United Nations
to be a i*eal peace agent. In an
swer to the opinion of many
countries that Red China is not
peace-loving, she said. "I can
point out at least 50 countries in

love peace for its own sake . . ."

GATHER BEFORE TALK—Mrs. Lakshmi Menon, Dr. Mur
thi and Naresh Shah converse before Mrs. Menon's speech
at Memorial Auditorium last night.
"India is going in the right direction," Mrs. Lakshmi Menon, dep
uty minister of external affairs for India, stated as the thesis of her
speech for the Tuesday Evening Series, "Whither India," last night.
Mrs. Menon feels that often Western countries have little under
standing of the Indian's point of view in administration, and she

presented India's domestic and
foreign policies.
WHILE other countries, such
as the United States .suspect a
trend toward Communism in
India, she emphasized that this
is confused with India's socialism.
The state controls the basic in
dustries, she explained, but there
was much nationalization of in
dustries long before India became
free from the British.
Great improvements have been
made in India since their inde
pendence in 1947, she pointed out.
They have had two elections in
which a great number of people
voted.
THE Administration is stable
and does not operate for the ad
vantage of a few, but for the gen
eral welfare. Resources have been
further developed by the planned
economy, but always democratic
freedom is combined with their
policies, she said.
"There has been a great change
in attitude in the people," she
said. Now there is a national civil
court, and civil law applies to all
citizens. Before 1947 there was no
single legal code for Hindu minor
ity groups.
"We are accused of leaning to
ward Communism," she said in
regard to India's foreign policy of
non-alignment, and added that
India also is accused of taking
aid from all countries while
preaching morality to all. She em
phasized that India, like any other
country, wants to pursue its own
interests.
