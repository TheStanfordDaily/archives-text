# Profs Call For HUAC Abolition
## 
### 
Seven Stanford professors were
among 250 leading American pro
fessors who recently signed a
statement calling for abolition of
the House Committee on Un-
American Activities because the
committee has "repeatedly under
mined the freedoms essential for
national well-being."
The statement, released by the
American Civil Liberties Union,
under whose auspices the profes
sors were canvassed, declares that
the HUAC "continues to abridge
citizens' rights of free speech and
association, (and) we call upon
the House of Representatives to
vote it out of existence. To per
petuate this committee is to per
petuate a threat to our liberties."
STANFORD signers are Moses
Abramovitz, professor of econom
ics; Bernard F. Haley, professor
of economics; Virgil K. Whitaker.
professor of English; John Henry
Merryman, professor of law and
law librarian; Philip E. Smith, re
search associate in anatomy;
Felix Bloch, professor of physics;
and Nobel Prize winner Arthur
Romberg, professor of biochem
istry. Twelve Cal professors also
signed the statement.
The professors who signed the
statement are actively engaged
in teaching. They come from 79
colleges and universities.
THE ACLU'S executive direc
tor. Patrick Murphy Malin, and
Prof. Louis M. Hacker, chairman
of the Union's Academic Freedom
Committee, noted the professors
had approved the statement per
sonally and their action does not
commit their institutions.
The statement struck hard at
the committee, declaring "During
its 24|-year history the House
Committee has been unrelenting
in its harassing of teachers. It
has again and again subpoenaed
them. It has enquired into text
books they use. In these ways the
committee has created fearfulness
within the academic world—and,
perhaps even more dangerous,
public distrust of teachers and the
institutions in which they serve.
"BY EXERCISING the powers
of prosecutor and judge, the com
mittee has caused grievous harm
to teachers and weakened the ed
ucational process."
Citing HUAC activity against
students and teachers who op
pose it, the statement said "Under
those circumstances, we find it
understandable, though deplor
able. that many teachers, in the
colleges and universities, as well
as in the public schools, have
grown timid about stating, even
for classroom discussion, ideas
which someone later might in
terpret as subversive." -

Merryman, professor of law and
law librarian; Philip E. Smith, re
search associate in anatomy;
Felix Bloch, professor of physics;
and Nobel Prize winner Arthur
Romberg, professor of biochem
istry. Twelve Cal professors also
signed the statement.
The professors who signed the
statement are actively engaged
in teaching. They come from 79
colleges and universities.
THE ACLU'S executive direc
tor. Patrick Murphy Malin, and
Prof. Louis M. Hacker, chairman
of the Union's Academic Freedom
Committee, noted the professors
had approved the statement per
sonally and their action does not
commit their institutions.
The statement struck hard at
the committee, declaring "During
its 24|-year history the House
Committee has been unrelenting
in its harassing of teachers. It
has again and again subpoenaed
them. It has enquired into text
books they use. In these ways the
committee has created fearfulness
within the academic world—and,
perhaps even more dangerous,
public distrust of teachers and the
institutions in which they serve.
"BY EXERCISING the powers
of prosecutor and judge, the com
mittee has caused grievous harm
to teachers and weakened the ed
ucational process."
Citing HUAC activity against
students and teachers who op
pose it, the statement said "Under
those circumstances, we find it
understandable, though deplor
able. that many teachers, in the
colleges and universities, as well
as in the public schools, have
grown timid about stating, even
for classroom discussion, ideas
which someone later might in
terpret as subversive." -
Seven Stanford professors were
among 250 leading American pro
fessors who recently signed a
statement calling for abolition of
the House Committee on Un-
American Activities because the
committee has "repeatedly under
mined the freedoms essential for
national well-being."
The statement, released by the
American Civil Liberties Union,
under whose auspices the profes
sors were canvassed, declares that
the HUAC "continues to abridge
citizens' rights of free speech and
association, (and) we call upon
the House of Representatives to
vote it out of existence. To per
petuate this committee is to per
petuate a threat to our liberties."
