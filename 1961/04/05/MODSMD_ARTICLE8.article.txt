# Brave Old Chappie Exposes 'SU 1984'
## 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE 
Dash to the nearest corner of |
Quad quick to pick up a copy of
the April Stanford Chaparral (40 ]
cents>, which is its old irreverent,!
spicy, damn-the-dean self as it
was when we all were freshmen.
"STANFORD-11)84" is the theme
and it may be that long before
you'll be able to buy another copy
of the mag. "Big Leland," who's
been "watching you from every
corner of the Farm this week as
a promotion gimmick" is the key-1
note. The Old Boy and cohorts I
have thrown together all of the I
sales-building gambits so notice
ably absent recently.
Chief teaser is a whiz-bang j
golly-gee queen like the ones we
saw when the Chappies didn't
care what anybody said. They've
eliminated all that "If you don't
hurry she'll be already dated for
Saturday" rot. and given sensual
Stanford roughs a treat instead
of a treatment.
STUDENT life in 1984 is fright
eningly Orwellian in a photo es
say which, with no apologies to j
Huxley or Freud, got guffaws |

from this hardened reviewer.
In "Creeping Sensualism," the
Chappie continues its attack (not
that ol' red-blooded Elly is dis
paraging it» on Stanford women,
by telling us how they'll ALL be
in 1984. Pneumatic, that's how!
Farm males may find this the
only Chappie forecast of the fu
ture which doesn't have us going
to hell in a handbasket- or by
horsepower, as Steve Zousmer in
his rather b.inal "Predestrianism
Revisited." It's dirty, though.
THERE ARE some pretty phys
ical cartoons, and some delight
fully risque limericks. Those old
movie clips are back in gay pro
fusion in Moom Pitchers, but this
time the reviewer actually tried
to comment seriously on «ome of I
the flicks.
This issue is Bill Kitchen's last
as Old Boy (he left school before
publication, if that's any clue to!
anticipated results). Some of Ihci
humor will be offensive to .some !
readers. Still, it's funny, and what j
classic collegiate humor hasn't
been a little blue? Congrats to the j
little men for bringing back the
old-time Chappie. I

have thrown together all of the I
sales-building gambits so notice
ably absent recently.
Chief teaser is a whiz-bang j
golly-gee queen like the ones we
saw when the Chappies didn't
care what anybody said. They've
eliminated all that "If you don't

Saturday" rot. and given sensual
Stanford roughs a treat instead
of a treatment.
STUDENT life in 1984 is fright
eningly Orwellian in a photo es

Huxley or Freud, got guffaws |

from this hardened reviewer.
In "Creeping Sensualism," the
Chappie continues its attack (not
that ol' red-blooded Elly is dis
paraging it» on Stanford women,
by telling us how they'll ALL be
in 1984. Pneumatic, that's how!
Farm males may find this the
only Chappie forecast of the fu
ture which doesn't have us going
to hell in a handbasket- or by
horsepower, as Steve Zousmer in
his rather b.inal "Predestrianism
Revisited." It's dirty, though.
THERE ARE some pretty phys
ical cartoons, and some delight
fully risque limericks. Those old
movie clips are back in gay pro
fusion in Moom Pitchers, but this
time the reviewer actually tried
to comment seriously on «ome of I
the flicks.
This issue is Bill Kitchen's last
as Old Boy (he left school before
publication, if that's any clue to!
anticipated results). Some of Ihci
humor will be offensive to .some !
readers. Still, it's funny, and what j
classic collegiate humor hasn't
been a little blue? Congrats to the j
little men for bringing back the
old-time Chappie. I
