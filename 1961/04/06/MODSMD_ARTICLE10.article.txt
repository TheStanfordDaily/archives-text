UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(UPI) â€” The Soviet Union yester
day dropped its complaint over
the U2 and R847 incidents with
no similar concessions on Hun
gary and Tibet by the United
States.
In another development, Secre-
I tary-General Dag Hammarskjold
(challenged the Russians to try to
I force him to resign reminding
the General Assembly that it has
a standing offer of his resigna
tion.
"So far," he .said, "the General
Assembly has not given this for
mal consideration. I must reserve
my right to revert to this issue
when the General Assembly con
cludes its debate on the Congo."
U.N. authorities considered this
a challenge to Russia to put its
demands for Hammarsk.jold's
resignation in the form of a reso
lution for Assembly action.
The United States earlier re
fused to forego debate on the
Hungarian and Tibetan issues, de
spite the Soviet move on the air
incidents.
Soviet Ambassador Valerian A.
Zorin told the Assembly's main
political committee that his gov
ernment was withdrawing its de
mand for U.N. action against the
United States because of the "new
! conditions" existing since Presi
i dent Kennedy took office.
