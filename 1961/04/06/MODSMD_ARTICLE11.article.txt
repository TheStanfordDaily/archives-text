that this country could not accept
Red China's demand that Nation
alist China be ousted from the
world organization if the Peiping
regime were admitted.
| Foreign Secretary Lord Home
led in stating the British view.
The British have indicated they
probably would vote to admit
Communist China if the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly agreed to take up
the issue this fall. But the Brit
ish have said they could not ac
cept. the ouster of Nationalist
China either.
The Laos discussion apparently

I that it still had his offer to resign
j any time the world body re

i would be best for the United
Nations.
ON another subject, Britain said
jit was acting as fast as it could
to grant independence to its Afri

argue over the timetable.
The leaders pledged a new ef
fort to coordinate aid to underde
veloped countries, principally
through the new development as
