# Wildlife Study Areas Receive New Protection
## 
### 
In an effort to protect one of
the only wildlife study areas re
maining near the campus. Stan
i ford has been forced to post signs
and guards around its 750-acre
Jasper Ridge Biological Experi
mental Area.
Set aside by the University's
trustees in 1956, the rocky,
wooded terrain of the Ridge bor
ders Searsville Lake and the
Westridge residential area.
The Ridge serves as a natural
outdoor laboratory for Farm bi
ology students. In addition, it is
the scene of several special re
search projects being conducted
by members of the biological sci
ences faculty.
INCREASING instances of de
struction to plants and small ani
mals on the Ridge have made it
necessary to step up surveillance
of the area, biologists said.
Despite all attempts to halt
them, hunting and target practice
have continued in the preserve.
Even casual strollers often un
knowingly damage patches of
flora under study by research in
vestigators.
In one instance, vandals drove a
bulldozer into the area, ripping
out fences and tearing up trees
and bushes.
TWO RIDING clubs have as
sisted them in patrolling the
I Ridge, said biologists. Riders
from the Woodside Trail Club
and Menlo Circus Club use their
own gates and keep horses on
established path s. Frequently
they have repaired or replaced
the preserve's fences when they
found them damaged.
Occasional deputies from the
San Mateo County Mounted Pa
trol also police the Ridge on
horseback.
"IT IS extraordinary to have so
many different types of vegeta
tion and their associated animal
forms within such a small area,"
according to I he biologists. "Many
institutions have been forced to
purchase, at tremendous expense,
inadequate small parcels of dis
turbed land to obtain a small frac
tion of the benefits we now ob
tain from the carefully controlled
! use of the Jasper Ridge area,
j "If Jasper Ridge were denuded,
[many, if not all, of these native
forms of animal life would disap
pear completely from the vi
cinity."
