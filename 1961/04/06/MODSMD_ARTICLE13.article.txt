## Opinion Page Leadership, Goals of Clubs Outlined by ICC President 
### 
As rushing continues many
freshmen are becoming more con
cerned with President Sterling's
statement that the living units
should become "integrated into
the total educational program."
The University is becoming in
creasingly desirous to make clubs,
fraternities, and independents
vital elements in the college com
muity and not something periph
eral to it. Although some would
wish to exploit this legitimate
wish by claiming leadership in
that pursuit, unbiased observers
applaud all those groups which
are sincerely atempting to find a
more important role in the Uni
versity. We subscribe to Mr.
Parker's enthusiasm over the
fact that the fraternities have
finally risen above the all-men's

grade-point average and that
"rowdiness and obscene behavior
are on the downturn." This cer
tainly constitutes progress, if not
leadership.
At the same time it might be
well to recall the record of the
Stanford Clubs during the last
half-century. Over that period the
clubs have met with conspicuous
success in both academic and ex
tracurricular activities. They still
lead the way in the faculty associ
ate program and maintain the
largest foreign student program
on campus. Its members have con
tributed to the success of the
many campus organizations,
claiming vice presidents and di
rectors of the lIR and Political
Union, editors of The Daily, pres
idents of the Axe Society, the
Alpine Club. theA-Phi-O, Cardi
nals, etc., and are actively en
gaged in ASSU offices and almost
all other organizations. Out of a
membership of 300 men in the
seven clubs, nearly 75 per cent
are participating in the further
ance of the varied campus activi
ties. At the same time, club men
have consistently stayed above
the all-men's average and claim
this year a Rhodes, a Marshall, a
Danforth, several Fulbright and
Woodrow Wilson Fellows as well
as numerous national defense and
national science foundation
awards.
The clubs are now on their own
initiative formulating plans for
expanded building facilities and
landscaping which will fit into
the total concept of University
life. The clubs, it is true, cherish
their independence; yet, at the
same time, they are demonstra
ting their social responsibility by
continuing ,as they have done for
50 years to lead the way in mak
ing university life a fuller and
richer experience. We realize that
both independents and fraterni
ties are making tremendous con
tributions to the advancement of
Stanford University and are
happy to be associated with them
in that endeavor. Nonetheless, we
cannot help but feel a certain
pride that we belong to a group of
men who have consistently at
tempted to meet all the needs of
its members—athletic, scholastic,
and social—and hope to continue
to offer a balanced college career
to Stanford men.
