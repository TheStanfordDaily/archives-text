# Less Than Mediocre
## 
### 
I thoroughly regret that the
present Daily staff has abandoned
the competent mediocrity of the
Greenberg administration. Most
of all I regret that the Daily has
ceased to be a "newspaper."
Anyone who peruses today's
edition will note the signs of de
cay. For example, 50 per cent of
the column space is devoted to ad
vertising. And any high school
journalist knows that the sure
sign of a rag is an advertisement
on page 1. The Daily now sports
two of them.
News? I count seven news
stories on the four pages: "Boat
house. .."Fire Department...
"Gigantic. . . "U.N. Troops
. . . "Econ. . . "Huntington
. . . SU Grads. . . The list in
cludes two borrowed AP stories.
And those who read "Econ, Chem
Departments Add Top Men" found
that it was the Business School
who gained a professor. The other
"news" is announcements: "Class
Lists. . . "Pilot Needed. . .
etc.
The editorials are appalling.
When not lifting homilies from
the L.A. Times, the editors clo
worse: To find the Daily wallow
ing in the milksop prose of "Me
morial Church Remembers Le
land!" ... I should object to the
listing of the weLl-known order
of-the-day in a church service, and
I object to irrelevant quotations
from Wesleyan hymnals. At least
there must have been gbneral re
lief that "During this hym there
was a colorful diversion." (!)
What would be the Daily's fate
if its tuition subsidy were cut off
and it had to depend on subscrip
tions as does the Harvard Crim
son? I submit that the Daily
would find itself in the same fi
nancial straits as the Chaparral.
