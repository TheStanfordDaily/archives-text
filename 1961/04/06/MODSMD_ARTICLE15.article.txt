# On Oath
## 
### 
I have, during recent weeks,
felt more and more discontented
with the Daily's new editorial pol
icies, and finally Tuesday's paper
inspires a few words of protest.
Although I am a faculty member
who believes that fraternities, on
the whole, are not an asset to our,
university, I must refrain from
"discordant harping" and so will
say no more about editorial num
ber one.
The main disagreeable shock of
the morning was the advocacy of
"loyalty oaths" for the new Peace
Corps. Some opponents of such
oaths were accused of "fuzzy
thinking," but the editorial itself
exhibited non-thinking in as much
as no arguments were advanced
and it was far from clear what
was really under discussion. If
"loyalty oath" means simply a
promise to uphold the Constitu
tion, then there is no compelling
reason against having one, al
though perhaps little is to bo
gained by it. But in our recent
history the term "loyalty oath"
has acquired a different meaning;
it has become a ritual denying of
certain political beliefs and cer
tain associations, and as such it is
an instrument of thought control.
To attempt to promote American
ideals of freedom by adopting
methods contrary to the spirit of
these ideals is to concede defeat
in advance. I believe that inclu
sion of an oath of this sort in the
Peace Corps set-up would, with
reason, disillusion many of the
Corps' most desirable candidates,
and would tend to raise some
question as to whether the Corps
was a genuine expression of inter
national good will or merely an
extension of cold-war strategy.
Surely this is one occasion when
some idealism is realistic and
necessary.
