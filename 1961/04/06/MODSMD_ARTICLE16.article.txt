# Endless Prose

Your verbosity is matched only
by your obtuseness. An editorial
is a comment, and, despite the
endless prose tumbling down your
editorial page, only two sentences
of Memorial Church Remembers
Leland qualify a} commentary:
"This is as a Founder's Day ad
dress should be. It is not as a
Memorial Church service should
be." Now, just at the point where
you might reward your reader's
flagging endurance by offering
him a concrete point of view, you
stop. The editorial is meaning
less; it avoids taking a stand on
any of the issues it so clumsily
touches upon.
After all, what exactly is wrong
with a tradition which must rely
on a captive audience for its con
tinuance? Is Founder's Day a
farce? What exactly should a Me
morial Church service be? Should
it include an inane prayer such
as: "O Lord we pray for our
friends in Australia, and the Pa
cific, that they may serve their
neighbors in the north and learn
from them," as it did on Febru
ary 19th?
In short, why raise such crucial
subjects as the state of Founder's
Day and Memorial Church, if
your conclusions are to be sus
pended in ambiguity? To my
mind, this is shallow editorializing
—something all too typical of
your regime.
