## Sees Threat of McCarthy Revival In Anti-Communist Birch Society 
### 
The philosophy of "radical con-1
servatism" in America, which sup
posedly died with McCarthy, has
been re-born in the form of the:
John Birch Society, an organiza-!
tion ostensibly dedicated to fight-'
i ing Communism.
The Society's self-appointed
j leader is John Welch, a former
candy manufacturer from Bel
mont, Mass. Welch, who sees a
Communist behind every tree,
went so far as to label former i
President Eisenhower "a dedi
cated, conscious agent of the
Communist conspiracy."
ANY LIBERAL who is worth
his salt does not cry out that the |
Birc-h Society shoidd be abolished i
since in this country any organiza- j
tion or any form of expression :
should be permitted. However,
the society's method of operation i
can and should be criticized.
Thousands of persons who be- I

lieve in free speech and fair play, |
including many conservative Re- j
publicans, have expressed greai i
concern over the society's meth-1
ods.
In the society's Bulletin for Sep
tember of last year, Welch urged !
his followers to join the PTA's: I
"Join your local PTA at the begin- j
ning of the school year, get your
conservative friends to do like
wise, and go to work to take it
over. You will run into real bat
ties against determined leftists |
who have had everything their
way. But it is time we went on
the offensive to make such groups J
the instrument of conservative,
purpose, with the same vigor and
determination that the "liberals"
have used for the opposite aims. '
When you and your friends get j
the local PTA group straightened
out move up the ladder as soon
as you can to exert a wider in
fluence. And don't let the dirty

tactics of the opposition get you
down."
THIS LAST sentence reveals
that the society uses Communist
methods. Combatting subversion
with subversion is no better than
fighting fire with fire.
In the Blue Book, the society's
bible, Welch wrote that "democ
racy is merely a deceptive phrase,
a weapon of demagoguery and a
perennial fraud." One wonders
what would happen to our de
mocracy if the Birch Society took
control.
That Welch is using dictatorial
methods is indisputable, lie says
that "disloyal" members will be
eliminated without going through
"any congress of so-called demo
cratic process." He has also made
it clear that his society would op
erate under complete, authorita
tive control at all levels. The na
tional council is charged with
picking a successor to Welch
should a "suicide or
equally fatal be arranged for me
by the Communists." The way
Welch behaves, it might be some
one far to the right of a Com
munist who arranges for his sui
cide.
WELCH DOLS not believe in
d ocumcnt in g his allegations,
either. In his magazine "Ameri
can Opinion," he conducts "sur
veys" of Communist infiltration
in 107 countries of the world. For
each country, Welch gives irre
sponsibly a percentage score on
degree of infiltration. Experts
wonder where he gets his figures.
To repeat, no one should deny
the Birch Society its right to exist,
but social acceptance of an organ
ization makes it incumbent upon

that organization to exercise
some responsibility. Such accusa
tions that Eisenhower is a Red,
lhat Truman, the Dulles brothers
and Neil McElroy are Communist
tools, will do neither the conserv
ative cause nor the nation any
good.
