# ON OTHER CAMPI
## Student Opinion Shifts Against HUAC Movie 
### KEEM STASSEN 
With the notable exception of
Stanford and Cal, people used to
believe what the movie "Opera
tion Abolition" said. Even stu
dents thought the film presented
the "facts." Oe student at Brown
wrote his Stanford friend that he
was concerned for his intellectual
safety amid all the San Francisco
Communists.
This has changed. Fulton Lewis
Jr. and the movie about the San
Francisco riots have been greeted

with everything
from cautious
criticism to crude
cat calls in cam
puses across the
country.
PERHAPS the
most original
protest was Wes
leyan's patriotic
performance
when Fulton
Lewis Jr., and

"Operation Abolition" visited the
Connecticut University's campus.
The students, according to the
campus paper, decided to be "su
per-patriotic in order to parady
what the patriots were doing and
show the low intellectual quality
of the film and the committee."

I Studenls carried flags and pla
| cards which said such slogans as
J "Fulton for Cod," "If it's Red,
Investigate it,"and "Give us liber
ty or give us Fulton." When the
I student body president made a
1 plea for d ecorum, someone
I shouted "It's the America Way."
HARVARD had what they
termed "a great debate" between
j the Young Democrats and the
! Young Republicans on the topic:
j "Resolved: That the HUAC
should be abolished." The Repub
licans, who took the negative,
won the debate.
The Harvard debate was
prompted by a showing of "Oper
ation Abolition" which was ac
compaied by Fulton Lewis Jr. The
Harvard Crimson wrote that
Lewis "handled a sometimes hos
tile crowd with considerable
aplomb, and produced impressive
documentation for some of his
claims." Harvard students dis
cussed the movie and the Com
mittee with Lewis until 3 a.m.
I AN EDITORIAL In the Univer
sity Daily Kansas said that "when
one gains access to documented
i evidence of what happened, he
j.stands aghast at the distortion
and misrepresentation shown."
The newspaper of Moravian Col
lege said students there took a
i "dim view of the film."
Two colleges prove to be excep
tions to the general feeling of dis
i trust of the movie. At Queens Col
| lege reception of the film "va
| ried." The College Times of Los
j Angeles State reports that "re»
action to the film was mixed."
Widespread distrust of the film
: does not necessarily mean dis
trust of the Committee. At Cor
i noil, however, both the Commit-
Itee and the movie are suspect,
j The film is called "Operation
j Aberration" and an example of
i "documentary propaganda."
According to one Cornell Daily
! Sun editorial "The San Francisco
riot gave the Committee a chance
! to take its slightly-distorted case
I to the people."
AN AP WRITIOR suggests that
"the film has greatly increased
the determination and the scale of
student oposition to the Commit
tee."
The Michigan Daily provides
perhaps the best perspective on
the film and the Committee. "The
film." states an editorial in the
Daily, "gives the opportunity for
expression on such vital issues
as academic freedom, the valid
ity of the Bill of Rights, and the
I need to cease regarding the ques
| tion of Communism in America
I as a sacred, undebatable issue."
