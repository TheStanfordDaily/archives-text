# Only CIA Has Missile Gap Answer
## 
### JOHN A. GOLDSMITH United Press International 
WASHINGTON — Much more
will be said, and more written,
about the "missile gap" but don't
expect the heated words to cast a
clear light on U.S. and Russian
missile strength.
Basically, the controversy is a
political argument between two
groups of partisans. It hinges on
a guess which is non-partisan but
carefully hedged and carefully
secret.
THE GUESS, of course, is the
so-called NIE, the national intel
ligence estimate of Russia's mis
sile power. The NIE combines the
best appraisal of Russian
strength from all U.S. intelligence
sources under the coordination of
the Central Intelligence Agency.
Participants in the controversy
—mostly Democrats and Republi
cans in Congress—assess the
"missile gap" by matching the
guess on Russian strength with
U.S. production plans and U.S.
forces.
LAST YEAR, before the elec
tion campaign the old "missile
gap" controversy got a lift when
some Democratic critics com
plained that the national intelli
gence estimates had been doc
tored—that our intelligence was
trying to read the minds of the
Russians.
The shoe got on the other foot
when President Kennedy's new
Defense Secretary, Robert Mc-
Namara, told newsmen at a back
ground briefing that the new ad
ministration's review of defense
policies had failed to disclose a
meaningful missile gap. GOP ora
tors cited the remark as evidence
of the falsity of the Democratic
campaign complaints.
IRRESPECTIVE of whether
McNamara did or did not take a
conversational misstep, the sub
stance of the argument that he
was making is important- more
important in the eyes of experi
enced observers here than the ac
tual size of missile stock-piles at
this point in history.
The secretary was insisting that
the U.S. is strong enough now to
meet any attack. He was saying
that the new administration will
take additional steps to stay that
wav.
