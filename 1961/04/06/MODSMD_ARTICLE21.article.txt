### KEN DERY Sports Editor 
Co-captains Don Bell and Rich
Klier will load iho Stanford track
team against invading powers
Sun Jose State and Oklahoma Sat
urday afternoon al 1:30 in Ihe
Stadium.
Coach Payton Jordan has called
his squad "my thinnest in many
years at Stanford."
HOWEVER he will not sell them
out. "They are thin, but even at
this early stage they have gone
beyond themselves and they are
going to be tougher as the season
progresses."
Klier, G-2, 170, is just a junior.
He has run as fast as 1:51.3 as
ihe great Ernie Cunliffe's succes
sor. A fine competitor, Klier fin
ished fourth in the AAWIJ meet
last year behind California's Jerry
Soibert, Cunliffe and Dick Lassen
of Stanford, all of whom have
graduated.
KIJEK is an inspirational type
who has come through already
this year despite a battle with an
ulcer.
Bell is currently spinning the
discus and to Jordan's delight his
strongest competition has come
from teammate Dave Weill.
In last week's meet with San
Jose and Occidental, Weill won
the discus event with a toss of
ITO'l- while Bell finished third
with 163-4 1 -.
Bell is also a junior and Weill
is just a sophomore.
THE MOST pleasant surprise of
the season has been John Fontius
in the high jump. Fontius is best
known for his basketball ability,
but was persuaded to come out
and help.
He tied for first last weekend
with a leap of 6-4 1 2. Jordan
smiled, "He went 6-B*4 in practice
this week and we're awfully glad
he's on our side."
Phil White has also developed
faster than expected and has
broken the school record in the
pole vault two weeks in a row.
His best vault to date is 14-4.
Len Bresehini, a junior, is
slightly built at 5-9. 155, but he
is proving his merit as a top sprin
ter.
NO DENNIS Johnson, Bres
ehini nevertheless ran a fine 9.8
century last weekend and is
termed a "picture runner" by Jor
dan.
Craig Barret is probably the
most versatile member of the
team and at the present time is
also the most valuable, having
scored the highest number of
points. In a practice meet he once
competed in seven events.
Barret has gone as well as 23-6
in the broadjump and along with
Dan Moore gives the Cards good
strength in this event.
