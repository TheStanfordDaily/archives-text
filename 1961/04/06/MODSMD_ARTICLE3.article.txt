# Saboteurs Set Fire to Cuba Sugar Refinery
## 
### 
HAVANA (UPI) — Anti-Castro
saboteurs yesterday set fire to
ihe nationalized Hershey sugar
mill, causing damage estimated
at $5 million.
The refinery is one of the is
land's largest. Army intelligence
agents were investigating the
cause of the blaze, the most seri
ous act of sabotage since two na
tionalized Woolworth stores were
set afire in downtown Havana last
month.
THE damage included $1.6 mil
lion in refined sugar, stored in
the mill's warehouse. Observers
said the fact that the warehouse
was loaded to capacity with 279,-
000 hundred-pound bags of sugar
indicated unsold sugar is piling
up on the government.
Earlier, Cuba charged that U.S.
ships and planes based at Guan
tanamo Bay were engaged in
"criminal activity" against Fidel
Castro's regime. The move op
ened a new campaign against the
navy base.
An angry note of protest was
sent to the United States via the
Swiss Embassy which now repre
sents American interests here.
Replying to Tuesday's U.S. pro
test against Cuba's attempt to
seize the American cable schooner
Western Union, the note violently
denounced the "aggressive atti
tude" of U.S. forces in Cuban wa
ters.
(IN Washington the State De
partment said it is contemplating
sending a new note to Cuba to
protest wliHt it charged was the
maltreatment of 22 Americans
being held in Cuban jails.)
The new Cuban protest note
specifically charged that a U.S.
cruiser fired anti-aircraft guns at
a Cuban plane on March 23 near
the port of Imias, about 30 miles
east of Guantanamo and said the
alleged attack was an example of
the "grave . . provocative . . crim
inal activity" of Guantanamo
based warships.
IT also charged that U.S. planes
"violated" Cuba's airspace 49
times between Feb. 15 and March
15. The "gravest" of these viola
tions was the alleged landing of
a U.S. helicopter 100 feet outside
the fence at Guantanamo base.

HAVANA (UPI) — Anti-Castro
saboteurs yesterday set fire to
ihe nationalized Hershey sugar
mill, causing damage estimated
at $5 million.
The refinery is one of the is
land's largest. Army intelligence
agents were investigating the
cause of the blaze, the most seri
ous act of sabotage since two na
tionalized Woolworth stores were
set afire in downtown Havana last
month.
THE damage included $1.6 mil
lion in refined sugar, stored in
the mill's warehouse. Observers
said the fact that the warehouse
was loaded to capacity with 279,-
000 hundred-pound bags of sugar
indicated unsold sugar is piling
up on the government.
Earlier, Cuba charged that U.S.
ships and planes based at Guan
tanamo Bay were engaged in
"criminal activity" against Fidel
Castro's regime. The move op
ened a new campaign against the
navy base.
An angry note of protest was
sent to the United States via the
Swiss Embassy which now repre
sents American interests here.
Replying to Tuesday's U.S. pro
test against Cuba's attempt to
seize the American cable schooner
Western Union, the note violently
denounced the "aggressive atti
tude" of U.S. forces in Cuban wa
ters.
