clared yesterday his troops are
I ready to lay down their arms the j
j moment the big powers reach an |
I accord On a cease-fire in Laos.
Phoumi, the pro-Western dep
uty premier and defense minister,
said the aim of the major powers
-especially the United States,
Britain and Russia—now appears
to be the same as that of the Lao
tian government—"the end of

I sources said they believe Russia ;
| has now agreed in principle wit hi
j Britain on an appeal for a cease-1
j fire in Laos and a simultaneous |
conference to settle the crisis
there. These sources said they
j understood a compromise peace
j formula was being drafted.
(British government sources in
i London reported "very satisfac-
I tory progress" in the negotiations
with Russia, and a foreign office
spokesman called the situation
"encouraging." >
Phoumi announced readiness of i
his troops to halt the fighting in
an interview with the govern
ment-operated news agency, Lao
I Press, following a two-hour cabi
net meeting called to discuss the
| Soviet reply to Western peace
proposals.
The meeting was convened only
hours after Phoumi reported that
12 planeloads of pro-Communist
rebel paratroopers had jumped in
the Vang Vieng area, some 65
miles north of Vientiane, in an
j apparent bid to seize control of a
strategic airstrip there.
(IN WASHINGTON a State De
partment spokesman said
Phoumi's report of the dropping
of paratroops apparently was in
correct. The spokesman said there
had been a parachute drop of
supplies to the Communists at
Vang Vieng. i
Reports from the Vang Vieng
area said Royal Laotian army
forces huiled artillery fire on a
suspected concentration of Red
paratroopers west of the town.
The reports said a probing gov
ernment patrol was turned by
rebel machine-gun fire.
Gen. Phoumi said he and other
officials of the government of
Premier Prince Bonn Qum have
"complete confidence" the big
powers eventually will arrive at
an agreement that will permit a
peaceful settlement of the Lao
tian situation.

his troops to halt the fighting in
an interview with the govern
ment-operated news agency, Lao
I Press, following a two-hour cabi
net meeting called to discuss the
| Soviet reply to Western peace
proposals.
The meeting was convened only
hours after Phoumi reported that
12 planeloads of pro-Communist
rebel paratroopers had jumped in
the Vang Vieng area, some 65
miles north of Vientiane, in an
j apparent bid to seize control of a
strategic airstrip there.
(IN WASHINGTON a State De
partment spokesman said
Phoumi's report of the dropping
of paratroops apparently was in
correct. The spokesman said there
had been a parachute drop of
supplies to the Communists at
Vang Vieng. i
Reports from the Vang Vieng
area said Royal Laotian army
forces huiled artillery fire on a
suspected concentration of Red
paratroopers west of the town.
The reports said a probing gov
ernment patrol was turned by
rebel machine-gun fire.
Gen. Phoumi said he and other
officials of the government of
Premier Prince Bonn Qum have
"complete confidence" the big
powers eventually will arrive at
an agreement that will permit a
peaceful settlement of the Lao
tian situation.
