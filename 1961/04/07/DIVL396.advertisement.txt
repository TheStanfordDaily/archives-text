BOOM!
Today, foregoing levity, lot us turn our keen young minds to the
No. 1 problem facing American colleges today: the population
explosion. Only last week four people exploded in Cleveland,
Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup. In case you're
thinking such a thing couldn't happen anywhere but in Cleve
land, let me tell you there were also two other cases la*t week —
a 45 year old man in Provo, Utah, and a 1!> year old girl in
Bangor, Maine—and in addition there was a near-miss in
Klamath Falls, Oregon—an eight year old boy who was saved
only by the quick thinking of his cat Walter who pushed the
phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialled the department
of weights and measures. (It would perhaps have made more
sense for Walter to dial the fire department, but one can hardly
expect a cat to summon a fire engine which is followed by a
Dalmatian, can one?)
I bring up the population explosion not to alarm you, for I
feel certain that science will ultimately solve the problem. After
all, has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as
the transistor, tlie computer, the bevatron, and the Marlboro
filter? Oh, what a saga of science was the discovery of the
Marlboro filter! Oh, what a heart-rending epic of endless trial
and error, of dedication and perseverance! And, in the end, what
a triumph it was when the Marlboro scientists after years of
testing and discarding one filter material after another—iron,
nickel, lead, fin, antimony, sponge cake—finally emerged, tired
but happy, from their laboratory, carrying in their hands the
perfect filter cigarette! What rejoicing there was that day!
Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we light a Marlboro
and settle back and enjoy that full-flavored smoke which conies
to us in soft pack or flip-top box at tobacco counters in all
fifty states and Cleveland!
Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems rising out of the
population explosion, but in the meantime the problems hang
heavy over America's colleges. This year will bring history's
greatest rush of high school graduates. Where will we find class
rooms and teachers for this gigantic new influx?
Well sir, some say the answer is to adopt 112 lie trimester system.
This system, now in use at many colleges, eliminates summer
vacations, has three semesters per annum instead of two, and
compresses a four year course into three years.
This is good, but is if good enough? Even under the trimester
system the student has occasional days off. Moreover his nights
are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind of all-out attack
that is indicated?
I say no. 1 say desperate problems call for desperate reme
dies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I say
we must do no less than go to school every single day of the
year. Hut that is not all. I say we must go to school hours
of cirri/ (In;/!
The benefits of such a program are, of course, obvious. First
of all, (he classroom shortage will immediately disappear he
cause all the dormitories can be converted into classrooms.
Second, tin 4 teacher shortage will immediately disappear because
all the night watchmen can be put to work teaching calculus
and Middle Fnglish poetry. And finally, overcrowding will
immediately disappear because everyone will quit school.
Any further questions?
