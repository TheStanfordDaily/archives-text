# STANFORD DEAN SPEAKS OUT
## A 						Critical Look at College Fraternities 
### WILLIAM G. CRAIG Dean of Men 
Fraternities have been a controversial is
sue in higher education since their beginning
over 150 years ago. They will continue to be
controversial but chances are they will re
main on the higher education scene for some
time to come, provided the fraternity leaders
are perceptive enough and persuasive enough
to make some fundamental changes.
What is the basis of this controversy and
why do so many administrators and faculty
members despair at the mention of national
social fraternity? The first problem has to do
with their being "in" but not "of" the uni
versity. That great and nebulous arm known
as "national" places fraternities in a unique
position in the university. A review of central

control by the national
organization would he prof
itable, exploring the possi
bilities of greater decentral
ization and more local
autonomy and reducing the
element of "outsidedness."
TIIK SIX ON|> problem
is inherent in the privilege
the fraternity enjoys in
being allowed to select its
members. This places it in
special-privilege status and

subject to t lie charge of snobbishness. This
privilege (rushing) usually carries confusion

into the academic routine, trie only accept
able counter from the fraternity is excep
tional service and academic excellence.
The third problem is racial and religious
discrimination.
The fourth area has to do with the label
of "anti-intellect ualism" in fraternities. Hell
weeks, pledge sneaks, extracurricular over
emphasis and identification of fraternities as
the center of the social whirl on most cam
puses, reinforce this view until the general
ization becomes fixed and difficult to uproot.
ALL OF THESF problems can be cap
suled into three general areas: educational
problems, organization problems and prob
lems of time. Educationally, do fraternities
contribute to the goals and values of higher
education? Is the dichotomy between social
and intellectual becoming greater? At one
time this dichotomy was useful because the
world was more leisurely, the pace not so
swift, the sense of urgency not so complete.
Today new values are placed on research, on
the intelligent citizen, relating not so much
to "good living" as to preservation of free
dom and the prevention of mass destruction.
With encouragement from the national or
ganization. college administration and fac
ulty, fraternities must redefine their role in
such a way as to use their social strengths
for intellectual ends and support the univer
sity in its search for excellence.
Many are dismayed at the failure of fra

ternities to keep pace with the world, the
larger society, and the new education. We
are prepared to admit that this is not simply
the consequence of a few badly motivated or
thoughtless persons. Perhaps the dilemma is
not so much one of individual motivation, as
of organization confusion. For example, the
local chapter finds itself under multiple, and
often conflicting, pressures; the national or
ganization, alumni, the administration of its
own school. Chances are the university lias
never clearly defined expectations regarding
fraternities and their behavior. Perhaps the
national organizations (or local alumni),
dominated by persons whose memories of
their fraternal days emphasize the "social"
aspects of college, cannot alter their own
perspectives, it may be that local chapters
find it easier to follow the "principle of least
effort" and cling to older codes because they
are not mature enough to face new situa
tions. Whatever the sources of these prob
lems may be, we must recognize the organ
ization problems involved, and not overem
phasize the poor performance of a few stub
born and ill-willed fraternity leaders.
IN RECENT YEARS educational systems
have imposed new intellectual demands on
students through more rigorous courses,
more reading assignments, more laboratory
work and higher expectations in general. The
amount of time expected for fraternity pur
poses—rituals, pledging, comaradeire, beer

busts, has remained constant. The amount of
time demanded by colleges and universities
has increased. The total amount of time avail
able to anyone has not changed. This has un
doubtedly created conflict between fraterni
ties and institutions, as well as conflict with
in many students who are caught in a
squeeze between their fraternity obligations
and their educational desires. Not infre
quently (or perhaps all too frequently) stu
dents have to move out of fraternity houses
to find the time to do their studies in the
way they wish; and those who don't, often
do far poorer work than they are capable of
doing.
The traditional "culture" of the fraternity
(with its emphasis on social life, de-empha
sis of intellectual pursuits, a premium on
being one of the group, etc.) is in conflict
with the newly emerging "culture" of some
institutions of higher learning. If mature and
responsible students and faculty can perceive
these problems in a common frame of refer
ence, it is likely that the codes of the fratern
ity can be moved in the direction of greater
concern with, and reward for, those behaviors
which more directly contribute to educational
goals without losing in the process their pri
mary group functions—which are important,
both for individuals and the institutions in
which they are located.
TIIKSK PROBLEMS are easier to under
stand when we look at the origins and history

of the fraternal organization. Fraternity
groups took root in a highly paternalistic
period of higher education in this country.
Under the sharp eye of puritanical faculty of
this early period, the students felt a need for
"independent" discussion groups and for the
opportunity to free themselves from the rig
idity of faculty members who were more in
terested in soul-saving than in intellectual or
professional development. From the start,
this kind of rebellion has marked the fra
ternity growth and is the thread of cohesive
ness which has existed down to the present
day, and I might add, is the despair of admin
istrator and faculty alike who try to change
it. This age group characteristically resists
the rigors of academic work. What better
way than to declare one's independence from
the authoritarian figures who, to their minds,
make up a typical college administration.
The earlier literary societies, out of which
the fraternities developed, flourished and
grew under the incentive of providing stu
dents with an outlet for debate, free discus
sion and an anena to test out new ideas. Their
libraries often surpassed those of the parent
institution, both in number and quality.
Literary fraternities were a new idea and
these groups pioneered a new concept.
Fraternities also pioneered in the develop
ment of university housing in this country.
By 1870 when higher education took a sudden
about-face from paternalism to extreme

wenl into the housing business. It
was some years later that univer
sities and colleges recognized the
importance of residence living as
an adjunct to the educative proc
ess. Under the "neweducation"the
fraternity group personality
changed abruptly from the liter
ary, intellectual emphasis to a
social, extracurricular interest.
The students of that day reveled
in the new freedom from faculty
resulting from the German in
fluence but did not enthuse over
its demands on scholarship. The
fraternities were the centers of
dissonance with the university's
new philosophy. This dissonance,
characteristic of the age group
parent relationship, was taken
out of the individual context and
put in a group setting focusing
more attention on the fraternities.
FOLLOWING 1870, as intellec
tualism grew in the university,
fraternities continued to flourish
in their concentration on other
values.
Fraternities were the center of
this gay life and "other directed"
activity. The chief criticism of
fraternities today is that they
have not changed in any signifi
cant or fundamental way from
this heritage. Higher education in
America has come of age. Scholar
ship and research are rewarded in
society today and leadership in
the country is turning to the edu
cated person. A strong force has
gained support in the U.S. pro
moting the concept of training for
excellence. This has led to com
petitive admissions, increasing fi
nancial support for excellence,
and greater attention to the care
and feeding of the undergraduate.
FRATERNITIES seem not to
have come of age. They have been
content with the status quo and
no longer assume the role of pio
neer in developing new ideas and
making contributions to higher
education. Fraternities have not
changed—they are drifting—they
hold to the old ways, the un
changed rituals that were deter
mined for a society of 50 years
ago while the university grows
beyond them. The clearly stated
ideals of the fraternity decalogue
are little known and seldom re
ferred to.
UNIVERSITY peripheral val
ues and non-essentials in the cur
riculum are giving way to a de
mand for new knowledge and cre
ative thinking. In this setting,
the college fraternity, as does
everything else in the scheme of
higher education, comes in for
close scrutiny and evaluation.
Their existence will depend on a
flexibility and an introspection
that will produce changes in val
ues and goals that are too far out
of step with those of the parent
university. As the university
moves to provide housing, the fra
ternity has to meet this challenge
with constructive programs in
line with the changing university.
It is doubtful that a small handful j
of elder fraternity men in a cen- J
tral office separated from the
university physically and philo-1
sophically can supply the needed j
leadership. President Hopkins of
Dartmouth pointed to this situa
tion a few years ago when he
stated, "the fraternities as a whole
have failed to remain articulated
with college life through its rapid j
transformations and under condi-!
tions where constituencies have;
been so vitaliy changed and col-'
lege responsibilities to these have
been so radically modified. In the i
process of change, all parts of
the college organization have ac
quired new responsibilities and
new opportunities. However the
fraternities intimately identified
with the social life of American
colleges during this period have
remained largely unchanged in
their objectives and their organiz
ation.
Through many years university
administrators, with notable ex
ceptions, have, in effect, abdicated
their responsibility to fraternities.
The situation points up a problem
of administrative control and re
sponsibility. On the one hand, the
national organizations hold a de
tached kind of administrative con
trol over the group. On the other
hand, the alumni organizations
function actively and more closely
in this role. The university admin
istration tries to fit into this tri
furcated administrative hierarchy
and in some instance Ihe entire
responsibility falls into a grey
area producing an anarchy in |
which mediocrity is perpetuated
and purposes and goals become I
confused. Constitutions, financial
statements, and vital information I
affecting the fraternities are
often unavailable to university of-!
ficers, producing misuderstand-1
ings and lack of communication.
THE FRATERNITIES intro-1
duced a system of small group liv- j
ing which has served as a model
to those in higher education con
cerned with residence living for

students. The small-group living
experience with the opportunity
to identify with a group of friends
is an important requisite for most
students. The leadership oppor
tunities that such a system en
genders appeals to certain indi
viduals and gives them practice in
both group work and business ex
perience, along with some admin
istrative responsibility. Where the
democratic process is not per
verted those living groups can
provide excellent experience and
can demonstrate the essential
qualities of a true democratic ex
perience.
Social experience which pro
vides learning in social skill,
poise, and self-confidence is a pos
itive contribution to any young
person. Ability in human rela
tions, participation in athletics
and plain good fun are the con
tinuing products of such a system
and should be preserved. Fratern
ities provide environments which
can encourage the shy and deflate
the over-aggresive. They can be
operated in such a way as to pro
tect individuality from undue
pressures to conform. The fra
ternity can provide a home life in
the university which can be a cen
ter for campanionship under a
program of minimum obligation
and maximum opportunity. More
emphasis on intellectual growth,
a view of learning as a primary
purpose, and respect for intelli
gence are assets and should be the
focus. The tendency on the part
of fraternities to select other stu
dents who are "like kind" nar
rows the horions and tends to re
inforce the prejudices of a group.
The problem of the selection of
membership should be overhauled
and reviewed very carefully. The
history of fraternities has shown
an amazing sequence of unquali
fied failures on the part of fra
ternities to operate on a basis of
mutual honor and confidence in
their rushing activities.
IT IS OBVIOUS that more sys
tematic research conducted on the
differences between fraternity
and non-fraternity men (on a
wide range of variables from so
cial background to academic
achievement) the varied percep
tions of fraternities in college
populations, will enable all of us
to understand more clearly the
processes at work.
Sometime ago W. H. Cowley
suggested that the National In
terfraternity Council cooperate
in a study to evaluate the fratern
ity system and provide each chap
ter and the university with a sci
entific look at itself in relation
to the community around it;. They
suggested -several questions to be
studied which could lead to some
answers along the lines of ques
tions raised in this paper. A care
fully designed study to help in re
defining the role of fraternities in
higher education is needed.
Among others, the following
questions could lead to helpful
information in planning for the
fraternity of the future:
1. How fraternities foster or re
tard the intellectual, scholarly,
social and ethical development of
their members.
2- How a fraternity group's
members face and resolve crises.
3. How membership in a fra
ternity changes attitudes.
4. YVhat circumstances produce
modifications in group and indi
vidual objectives and programs.
5. How the ceremonial behavior
of the group influences individual
behavior.
0. How the tradition and in
herited patterns of behavior in
fluence group and individual ac
tivities.
7. How the ideology of the fra
ternity operates in a wide range
of directions from the pledging of
freshmen to the chapter partici
pation in large campus move
ments.
8. Do persons who join sub
cultural units which have char
acteristic behaviors differ psycho
logically from those who do not?
0. Do fraternities serve as ref
erence groups to reduce dis
sonance with the larger culture
for those who become fraternity
oriented?
These are only a few of the
questions that might well be
tested in a much needed scientific
study of the contribution the fra
ternity makes to the college and
university of todav.

In summarizing, the following
specific suggestions are proposed
for further consideration:
1. That closed ties between the
university and the fraternities be
made and that national organiza
tions relax their centralized au
thority. Specifically, national of
ficers, university officials, key
alumni, and active leaders need
to sit down and redefine for the
local campus the peculiar role the
fraternity plays in that setting
and clear-cut ground rules of ad
ministration established.
2. That the fraternities get rid
of Hell Weeks and Pledge Sneaks
and the rowdy, juvenile types of
organized activities which have
characterized them for years as
anti-intellectual and have proved
to be one of the greatest deter
rents to fraternities in the eyes of
the public and university faculty.
3. That more thought be given
to the influences of fraternity life
on the university community, the
membership, and particularly on
non-fraternity members. This
should be studied in terms of the
changing educational philoso
phies which are bound to affect
the organization and objectives of
the fraternity. Some of the contri
butions of fraternities are mis
understood. Others remain unde
fined.
4. Discriminatory clauses must i
be eliminated in the national or
ganizations providing for local
autonomy as to the selection of
membership. This is not only a
social issue in this country but
the matter of racial and religious
discrimination becomes a matter
of educational policy, contrary to
the purposes of education.
5. The internal organizations of
the fraternities must be strength
ened — workshops in leadership
and plodgeship, scholarship, and
constructive social life should be
instituted for the purpose of pro
viding the best possible environ
ment for its members in terms of
the objectives of the fraternity
and the university and in connec
tion with other groups within the
university.
6. Finally, before the univer
sity is eligible to criticize fratern
ities for their present position in
higher education, it should state
clearly what is expected of them
and provide assistance and coun
sel to gain the desired ends.
