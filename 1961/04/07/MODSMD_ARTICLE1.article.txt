# STANFORD DEAN SPEAKS OUT
## A
						Critical Look at College Fraternities 
### WILLIAM G. CRAIG Dean of Men 
Fraternities have been a controversial is
sue in higher education since their beginning
over 150 years ago. They will continue to be
controversial but chances are they will re
main on the higher education scene for some
time to come, provided the fraternity leaders
are perceptive enough and persuasive enough
to make some fundamental changes.
What is the basis of this controversy and
why do so many administrators and faculty
members despair at the mention of national
social fraternity? The first problem has to do
with their being "in" but not "of" the uni
versity. That great and nebulous arm known
as "national" places fraternities in a unique
position in the university. A review of central

control by the national
organization would he prof
itable, exploring the possi
bilities of greater decentral
ization and more local
autonomy and reducing the
element of "outsidedness."
TIIK SIX ON|> problem
is inherent in the privilege
the fraternity enjoys in
being allowed to select its
members. This places it in
special-privilege status and

subject to t lie charge of snobbishness. This
privilege (rushing) usually carries confusion

into the academic routine, trie only accept
able counter from the fraternity is excep
tional service and academic excellence.
The third problem is racial and religious
discrimination.
The fourth area has to do with the label
of "anti-intellect ualism" in fraternities. Hell
weeks, pledge sneaks, extracurricular over
emphasis and identification of fraternities as
the center of the social whirl on most cam
puses, reinforce this view until the general
ization becomes fixed and difficult to uproot.
ALL OF THESF problems can be cap
suled into three general areas: educational
problems, organization problems and prob
lems of time. Educationally, do fraternities
contribute to the goals and values of higher
education? Is the dichotomy between social
and intellectual becoming greater? At one
time this dichotomy was useful because the
world was more leisurely, the pace not so
swift, the sense of urgency not so complete.
Today new values are placed on research, on
the intelligent citizen, relating not so much
to "good living" as to preservation of free
dom and the prevention of mass destruction.
With encouragement from the national or
ganization. college administration and fac
ulty, fraternities must redefine their role in
such a way as to use their social strengths
for intellectual ends and support the univer
sity in its search for excellence.
Many are dismayed at the failure of fra

ternities to keep pace with the world, the
larger society, and the new education. We
are prepared to admit that this is not simply
the consequence of a few badly motivated or
thoughtless persons. Perhaps the dilemma is
not so much one of individual motivation, as
of organization confusion. For example, the
local chapter finds itself under multiple, and
often conflicting, pressures; the national or
ganization, alumni, the administration of its
own school. Chances are the university lias
never clearly defined expectations regarding
fraternities and their behavior. Perhaps the
national organizations (or local alumni),
dominated by persons whose memories of
their fraternal days emphasize the "social"
aspects of college, cannot alter their own
perspectives, it may be that local chapters
find it easier to follow the "principle of least
effort" and cling to older codes because they
are not mature enough to face new situa
tions. Whatever the sources of these prob
lems may be, we must recognize the organ
ization problems involved, and not overem
phasize the poor performance of a few stub
born and ill-willed fraternity leaders.
IN RECENT YEARS educational systems
have imposed new intellectual demands on
students through more rigorous courses,
more reading assignments, more laboratory
work and higher expectations in general. The
amount of time expected for fraternity pur
poses—rituals, pledging, comaradeire, beer

busts, has remained constant. The amount of
time demanded by colleges and universities
has increased. The total amount of time avail
able to anyone has not changed. This has un
doubtedly created conflict between fraterni
ties and institutions, as well as conflict with
in many students who are caught in a
squeeze between their fraternity obligations
and their educational desires. Not infre
quently (or perhaps all too frequently) stu
dents have to move out of fraternity houses
to find the time to do their studies in the
way they wish; and those who don't, often
do far poorer work than they are capable of
doing.
The traditional "culture" of the fraternity
(with its emphasis on social life, de-empha
sis of intellectual pursuits, a premium on
being one of the group, etc.) is in conflict
with the newly emerging "culture" of some
institutions of higher learning. If mature and
responsible students and faculty can perceive
these problems in a common frame of refer
ence, it is likely that the codes of the fratern
ity can be moved in the direction of greater
concern with, and reward for, those behaviors
which more directly contribute to educational
goals without losing in the process their pri
mary group functions—which are important,
both for individuals and the institutions in
which they are located.
TIIKSK PROBLEMS are easier to under
stand when we look at the origins and history

of the fraternal organization. Fraternity
groups took root in a highly paternalistic
period of higher education in this country.
Under the sharp eye of puritanical faculty of
this early period, the students felt a need for
"independent" discussion groups and for the
opportunity to free themselves from the rig
idity of faculty members who were more in
terested in soul-saving than in intellectual or
professional development. From the start,
this kind of rebellion has marked the fra
ternity growth and is the thread of cohesive
ness which has existed down to the present
day, and I might add, is the despair of admin
istrator and faculty alike who try to change
it. This age group characteristically resists
the rigors of academic work. What better
way than to declare one's independence from
the authoritarian figures who, to their minds,
make up a typical college administration.
The earlier literary societies, out of which
the fraternities developed, flourished and
grew under the incentive of providing stu
dents with an outlet for debate, free discus
sion and an anena to test out new ideas. Their
libraries often surpassed those of the parent
institution, both in number and quality.
Literary fraternities were a new idea and
these groups pioneered a new concept.
Fraternities also pioneered in the develop
ment of university housing in this country.

about-face from paternalism to extreme
