# City Federalization Must Be Reversed
## 
### 
President Kennedy's "New Frontier" has swept from the prairies
into the metropolitan areas of the country. An administration-backed
bill has been introduced in the Senate to provide more than $1
billion in federal aid to depressed areas. It is an important part |
of the slow federalization of cities and towns —unfortunately aided
by a good percentage of city administrators.
Pennsylvania's Senator Clark, who introduced the bill, stated
that the American Municipal Association reported that 45 out of 60
city officials wanted this aid. The officials have blindly put their ,
head into the federal vise. The bill is a matching one—the local
government puts up fifty-five per cent of the money for local proj
ects. The federal government puts up the other forty-five per cent.
In many cases this leads to foolhardy and wasteful projects which
cities in reality cannot afford and which would not have built if
federal money had not been available. In any case, the taxpayer
in the municipality must pay more than half of a project which j
probably would differ radically if the community had planned the !
project itself. In addition as federal control spreads over the project,
the city finds itself building unnecessary works.
The situation has been created as city managers have surren- i
dered their independence to Washington in order to take a bigger
bite of the ever increasing federal taxes. Like the medieval coun
trymen they have taken protection in turn for loss of freedom.
Such a trend should be reversed. The cities, both large and
small, control the House of Representatives. A reduction in federal
taxation would free money for local revenue—for projects tailored 1
by the individual cities to fit their different needs.
Let's not go back to a depression-like Works Progress Adminis
tration. Rather the federal government, in a substitute bill, could
give tax relief to communities willing to tax themselves.
