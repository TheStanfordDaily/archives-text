Richard Nixon asked in a letter to The Times, "Why do such
organizations (meaning the John Birch Society, among others) have
such enormous appeals to thousands of loyal public-spirited Ameri
cans?"
And then he answered his own question: "It is because our
existing political organizations, with very few exceptions, do not
offer a challenging, vital and effective program to fight the great
battle for preserving and extending American ideals."
This has been true for a long time, specifically in California,
and again, specifically, with the Republican Party, which was prob
ably in Mr. Nixon's thoughts as he wrote the letter. For man is a
political animal, and if he cannot satisfy his political aspirations in
normal ways he is rather more than likely to take up isms of one
sort or another and follow leaders who have more zeal than wis
dom. When there is no appeal to his reason, the appeal to his
instincts will do.
For some years the Republican Party in California has tended
to ignore the normal political man—except just before elections—
and as a result he sometimes wanders off after strange gods. And j
he can hardly be blamed, for his political interest is not something |
that can be turned on every two years like a water faucet, and j
then turned off again.
Mr. Nixon tells us that the two-year dry spells are a result of
defects in party leadership, and we think he is correct. As a matter ;
of fact, the proof of his correctness may be seen in recent successes ;
of the Democratic Party in California, which manages to sustain
political interest and participation in and out of election seasons. |
The Democratic success is the result of the leadership Mr. Nixon
is talking about, and it does not take a specialist to perceive how '
it operates.
In the Republican camp there is a tendency for the doctors to ;
argue while the patient dies. A leader cannot merely decide on a
course of political action; he must persuade a good many follow-'
ers that his course is correct, and after that he must continually |
feed the fires of their enthusiasm. This is not a lost art with Re-;
publican leaders, but it has fallen into disuse. There are Republican
organizations in this state that used to do just what Mr. Nixon and
we are urging, but these organizations are ill-nourished and politi
cally moribund; they continue to exist largely to satisfy the vanity
of persons who pretend to have influence in Republican affairs,
chiefs with very few Indians.
Mr. Nixon put it better: "Our political organizations (for which
read Republican organizations) tend in non-election years to become
somewhat self-perpetuating social clubs, almost completely sterile
in developing new ideas and new leadership for the nation."
There are ways of recruiting workers for the party besides round
ing up a handful of letter-addressers and stamp-lickers in organiza
tion headquarters, and besides organizing telephone brigades a
couple of weeks before the election. There is nothing wrong with
these activities but they leave much undone. When a Republican
stays away from the polls on election day, as, alas, he often does,
it is not so much because he is displeased with a campaign tactic;
by studiously ignoring him for two years, the party leaders have
given him a broad hint that he doecn't belong—and he takes the
hint.

such enormous appeals to thousands of loyal public-spirited Ameri
cans?"
And then he answered his own question: "It is because our
existing political organizations, with very few exceptions, do not
offer a challenging, vital and effective program to fight the great
battle for preserving and extending American ideals."
This has been true for a long time, specifically in California,
and again, specifically, with the Republican Party, which was prob
ably in Mr. Nixon's thoughts as he wrote the letter. For man is a
political animal, and if he cannot satisfy his political aspirations in
normal ways he is rather more than likely to take up isms of one
sort or another and follow leaders who have more zeal than wis
dom. When there is no appeal to his reason, the appeal to his
instincts will do.
For some years the Republican Party in California has tended
to ignore the normal political man—except just before elections—
and as a result he sometimes wanders off after strange gods. And j
he can hardly be blamed, for his political interest is not something |
that can be turned on every two years like a water faucet, and j
then turned off again.
Mr. Nixon tells us that the two-year dry spells are a result of
defects in party leadership, and we think he is correct. As a matter ;
of fact, the proof of his correctness may be seen in recent successes ;
of the Democratic Party in California, which manages to sustain
political interest and participation in and out of election seasons. |
The Democratic success is the result of the leadership Mr. Nixon
is talking about, and it does not take a specialist to perceive how '
it operates.
In the Republican camp there is a tendency for the doctors to ;
argue while the patient dies. A leader cannot merely decide on a
course of political action; he must persuade a good many follow-'
ers that his course is correct, and after that he must continually |
feed the fires of their enthusiasm. This is not a lost art with Re-;
publican leaders, but it has fallen into disuse. There are Republican
organizations in this state that used to do just what Mr. Nixon and
we are urging, but these organizations are ill-nourished and politi
cally moribund; they continue to exist largely to satisfy the vanity
of persons who pretend to have influence in Republican affairs,
chiefs with very few Indians.
Mr. Nixon put it better: "Our political organizations (for which
read Republican organizations) tend in non-election years to become
somewhat self-perpetuating social clubs, almost completely sterile
in developing new ideas and new leadership for the nation."
There are ways of recruiting workers for the party besides round
ing up a handful of letter-addressers and stamp-lickers in organiza
tion headquarters, and besides organizing telephone brigades a
couple of weeks before the election. There is nothing wrong with
these activities but they leave much undone. When a Republican
stays away from the polls on election day, as, alas, he often does,
it is not so much because he is displeased with a campaign tactic;
by studiously ignoring him for two years, the party leaders have
given him a broad hint that he doecn't belong—and he takes the
hint.
