### 
Greatest Asset
This letter is in answer to the
"Condemned Men" article which \
challenged Stanford women to re- j
vive their femininity.
Stanford women are women in
the truest sense of the word, j
Even though they may not be at
tractive, they can't be equalled
culturally or intellectually. After
all isn't this what a Stanford man
is really looking for? We and
many others believe the San Jose
Blast was a flop, because the San
Jose women although attractive
were intellectually incapable of
carrying on an intelligent conver
sation.
In conclusion T would like to j
urge the Stanford men to appre
ciate their greatest asset, the
Stanford women.
