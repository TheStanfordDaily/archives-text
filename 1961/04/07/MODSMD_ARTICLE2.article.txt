## Daily Sports 
### KEN DERY Sports Editor 
There'll be running, jumping,
hurdling, yelling, sunning and eat
ing tomorrow afternoon at Stan
ford Stadium and unless we miss
our guess a tremendous track;
meet.
The festivities are scheduled to I
get underway at 1:30 p.m. and the
visiting participants have come
from as close as San Jose and as j
far as Norman, Oklahoma.
IN ADDITION to the main tri-j
angular meet a triple-dual meet ;
will be run simultaneously.
Each school has outstanding j
performers and there is a possi-'
bility that two new world records
may lie set.
Dennis Johnson of San Jose j
State will lie taking a crack at a i
9.2 century the long-time goal of |
the sprinters.
TIIE JET from Jamaica has tied
the world's record twice in the |
last two weeks and the track i
world waits anxiously whenever;
the lithe Negro blasts from the
starting blocks.
Spartan Coach Bud Winter says,!
"If anybody is going to run a 9.2 |
Johnson will."
J. D. Martin of Oklahoma will
face some of his strongest com-'
petition in the pole vault, but he!
is expected to win and then take;
a shot at 15-K). The existing
standard of 15-9'i belongs to Don '
Bragg and was set at Stanford j
last summer during the Olympic
trials.
THIS WILL be the student
body's first look at the hard-work-

ing Cards for the only other home
meet look place during spring va
cation. And there is plenty to see.
Co-captain Rich Klier will run
the half mile and those who re
member the great Ernie Cunliffe
should not be too disappointed.
Klier has gone as well as 1:51.1
and usually comes up with a
clutch performance in the big
meets.
Don Bell, the other co-captain,

will spin the discus and along
with huge Dave Weill (6-7, 270)
should give the invaders some
trouble. Dan Studney of San Jose
and Mike Lindsay of the Sooners
also specialize in this event,
which may well steal the show.
THK BROAD jump should also
be a close event With five of the
six entrants having Iheir career
bests from 23-1 ■"•.» to 24-5'4.
Jumping for Stanford will be
Dan Moore and Craig Barrett.,
Moore has recovered well enough ,
from a leg injury to place first
last week in the meet with San
Jose and Occidental.
Steve Swal'ford of Oklahoma is
the man with the 24-5 1 4. but he
may have to fly farther to win it
tomorrow.
IT WAS announced vesterdav

that top quarter miler Chris Hun
gerland is out for the rest of the
season with a too injury. Hun
gerland had churned 48.4 in the
440 for the Cards and will be
missed.
The meet will close with that
delightful tradition which never
fails to send tiie fans home smil
ing Beof-on-t he-Hoof.

Under its more conventional
name, the weight man's relay, is
hidden the perfect finish to an 1
exciting day.
EACH MAN runs 110 yards in!
this sprint relay and at present
Stanford's team of Art Batchelder
(208), Chris Jessen (208), Weill j
(2701 and Bell (220i is undefeated.
