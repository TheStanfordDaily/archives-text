## 
### 
A stocky purse-snatcher ap
parently not interested in money
| has hit the Stanford campus twice
within the past month, Police
Chief Gordon Davis reported yes
terday.
In both cases the snatcher
grabbed a girl's purse at night
and then threw it away without
disturbing the contents. Davis
said the snatchings were "the
only two in my memory" at Stan
ford.
The second instance occurred
Tuesday night when someone
yanked the purse from the hand
of freshman Lyn Wolfe as she
walked up the bike path to Roble.
The person ran, but a Stanford
policer officer later found the
purse about 150 feet from where
the incident happened.
Miss Wolfe described the per
son as being short, about 5-feet,
6-inches tall, of dark complexion,
weighing about 170 pounds and
about 18 years old.
Earlier, on March 13. a bicycle
riding male of the same descrip
tion snatched a purse from a girl
near the Union on Santa Teresa
Street. Again, the purse later was
found near the spotâ€”its contents
unmolested.
That incident took place at 9:05
p.m. Tuesday's snatching hap
pened at 10:05 p.m.
