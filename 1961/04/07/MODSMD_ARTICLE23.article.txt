# OVER $1 MILLION
## Fund Reaches All-Time High 
### 
Contributions to the 1960 Stan-1
fold University Fund rose to an i
all-time high of $1,201,140, making
it the first in which alumni con
tributions alone have surged over |
the million-dollar mark, accord
ing to Lawrence W. Harris Jr.,
chairman of the drive.
The sum resulted from 18,429
gifts from alumni and parents of
students. The goal was $1,200,000.
Harris said the dollar total was
10 per cent greater than that
achieved in the 1959 campaign,
when 17.391 gifts produced $1.-
033,031.
The drive just completed was
the 25th annual appeal made
since the fund was created by the
Stanford Associates, a group of
volunteers who assist the Uni
versity in fund-raising efforts.
Nearly 2,000 alumni volunteers
took part in the solicitation for
funds.
