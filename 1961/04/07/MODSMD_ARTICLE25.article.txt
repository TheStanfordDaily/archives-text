# The
						Northern Lights Have Seen Strange Sights But the Strangest They Ever Did See—

What happens to a man sud
denly dropped from the sky in
the Arctic winter and left to fend
for himself? What mental and
physical tortures can he stand be
fore he reaches the end of his
tether? How long can be live
without food?
A research team from the De
partment of Physiology of Stan
lord's School of Medicine spent
five February days camped on a
frozen Alaskan river in an at
tempt to get some of the answers
to these questions for the Air
Force.
Included in the group were
three medical students who, as
subjects in the experiment, learn
ed about Arctic survival at first
hand.
THEY' CAN testify that a
downed flier will get very irrita
ble after a couple of days—so
much so he may squabble with a
good friend over the supply of
firewood, even though trees are
all around.
His mind will skip about from
subject to subject, even though
he may try to put his free time
to good use.
He will do useless tasks like
making a fire he doesn't need.
(His clothing is so well insulated
that heat cannot penetrate.) As
student Charles C. Jenkins put it,
"A fire keeps you busy and makes
you feel good." His classmate,
Henry F. Davis, added: "With a
fire you feel you can master the
elements."
MOST important, however, is
the matter of food.
Though their stomachs some
times seemed to be tied in knots,
the six subjects found that starv
ing for five days did them no real
harm. They lost an average of
about 12 pounds each, but quickly
gained the weight back afterward.
They learned a man could live on
nothing but melted snow if he had
the sense to conserve his energy.
Interesting as these impressions
may be, they are only by-products
of ihe study. The trip was really
arranged to allow Stanford physi
ologists to conduct a careful sci
entific experiment.
THE EXPERIMENT was ear
lied out on the Chena River at
the Air Force's Arctic Aeromedi
cal Laboratory. The laboratory is
located at Fort Wainwright near
Fairbanks.
As planned by Assistant Prof.
Terence A. Rogers, one objective
was to determine the exact en
ergy cost of living in this hostile
environment. From this informa
tion Rogers hopes to predict the
likely survival time of a starving
man in the Arctic. Obviously such
knowledge would be of vital in
terest to the Air Force.

Other purposes were to learn
more about the dehydration which
accompanies cold exposure and
starvation, and about the psycho
logical deterioration of the sub
jects.
ROGERS, Jenkins and Davis
were three of the subjects. Vance
Israel, another student, and two
Air Force men also camped on the
ice.
Prof. Ronald Grant of the Phys
iology Department, John Klop
ping, cinefluorography technician
in radiology, and James Setliff,
Rogers' research assistant, made
up the support crew.
While the "icemen" rested in
their shelters, the support crew
had to work night and day. They
serviced the devices which meas
ured oxygon consumption, carried
specimens to the field laboratory
and did necessary analyses for the
experiment.
THE SCIENTIFIC findings of
the project will not be ready for
several weeks. But the students,
two of whom used part of the
free time in the medical curricu
lum to make the trip, have learned
the value and difficulties of re
search carried out in the field.
And they learned a great deal
about the capacity of the body to
withstand physical and emotional
strain. Two suffered from frost
bite and found their feet still ex

tremely sensitive two weeks after
their ordeal was over.
THEY also found out what five
days of starvation can do to a
man's hunger. Davis gained 13
pounds in 27 hours. Israel report
ed having "an immorally huge ap
petite. I ate until I was full and
my palate still craved the eating
experience," he said.
"From now on I'll have a little
more sympathy with compulsive
eaters."
