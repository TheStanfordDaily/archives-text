# Card Nine Meets Pepperdine Twice
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Pepperdine invades the Farm today and tomorrow for a pair of
baseball games with the Tribe. Both contests will take place at
Sunken Diamond with the first pitch being thrown at 3:15.
In an attempt to improve the current 9-5 record Coach Dutch
Fehring will start the same lineup that faced UCLA last weekend.
Catching will he Mike Mageo, ; -

but he is pressed by Bob Over
man. who has been hitting .571 in
his limited batting appearances
with the varsity, and has been
hitting almost as well with Ihe
Braves.
AT FIRST base, Leo Moench is
the starter, with Jim Cowart like
ly to -see action.
In a recent shift. Skip Lawrence
has been moved from right field
to second base, with Miko Filice
moving to the sidelines to make
way for sophomore Greg Post.
Lawrence is currently leading the
Tribe in hitting with a .393 aver
age.
AT THIRD base is Rich Ferraz
zano, who had a big weekend
against UCLA, including a home
run. Aside from stroking the ball
well of late, Porra/.zano gives
good protection to the right side
of the diamond defensively.
The starting shortstop is Joel
Shulman. Shulman has hit a bat
ling slump, but his glovework has
boon no less than sensational, and
lie has been the big reason why
Stanford has twice as many dou
ble plays as its opponents.
JOHN lILRLBUT, Hal Schutz
man, and Greg Post, from left to
right, form the outfield. Hurlbut
is the Tribes' cleanup man, with a
slugging per cent of .647, and an
average of a run batted in for
each Stanford game.
Schutzman has raised his aver
age close to 100 points to where
he is the second loading hitter
with a .346 average. His good rec
ord as a leadoff batter is evi
denced by his 13 runs scored.
Post has batted .323 since he
was brought up from the junior
varsity and has furnished needed
speed on the basepaths. Ho has
been on base 16 times and has
stolon a whopping seven bases.
Friday's pitcher for Stanford
will 1)0 Jim Smith, who has com
piled a 3-1 record, striking out 25
bailers in 29-.-, innings.
Mark Miller is scheduled to go
nine innings on Saturday. Miller
is also 3-1.
THE PEPPERDINE Peps are
not a team to be trifled with, hav
ing compiled a record of 11-8. The
Pops last year were ranked in the
tof) 10 baseball teams in the na
tion, and were blessed with an All-
Coast pitcher in Bon Burnetto.
Burnet to is back, along with most
of the first team, and many junior
college transfers that should help.
