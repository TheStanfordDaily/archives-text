The Stanford tennis team trav
els south this weekend to open
league play against its two strong
est rivals, USC and UCLA.
The Cards take on USC this

tion in the conference litle race.
He says. "We hope to split with
them this weekend and beat them
both when we meet them on our
home courts later in the season."
The team is led by Dick Ogden,
a senior and two-year letterman.
Two years ago Ogden reached the
doubles semi-finals of the NCAA
tournament.

Another standout on the team

Norman Karns. Says Renker,
"Karns is in the best shape of his
life and I am expecting big things
of him this year."
Renker also has high hopes for
live success of sophomores Bill
Hurley and Peter Snook. Hurley
was a top junior player in the
Northwest.
Hounding out the team is senior
Phil Odegard.
The Trojans are headed by
Rafael Osuna who was on the
winning Wimbledon doubles team
last year.
The Card's will face even
tougher competition when they
meet UCLA, conference cham

pioship team has returned.
TOP MAN for the Bruins is

well balanced and has no big weak
spots.
