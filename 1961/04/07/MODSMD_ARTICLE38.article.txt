# Palmer Leading Masters Golf
## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (UPI) De
fending champion Arnold Palmer
and bespectacled Bob Rosburg, a
pair <Â»i golfers with completely
different styles, both shot four
under par NS's in a steady rain
yesterday to share the lead in the
opening round of the 25th Masters
Championship.
Palmer and the pudgy Rosburg
finished one stroke ahead of
South Africa's Gary Player, who
fined a 33-36 (if).
