# Water Rationing Going into Effect Soon
## Move Forced by One of Driest Years in History 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
Water rationing will go into ef
fect at Stanford soon as the Uni
versity heads into a dry spring
and summer after one of the dri
es! winters in Peninsula history.
The announcement was made
yesterday by S. F. Post, assistant
business manager and director of
Stanford's physical plant.
He said water rationing—in the
form of a ban or car . ..tolling,
cutback on lawn watering and
general faucet-tightening all over
campus- will be instituted in the
near future, probably in the next
couple of weeks.
THE MOVE is necessary be
cause the lakes and weds supply
ing the Stanford community are
very low and"it is pretty late to
expect heavy rain" necessary to
fill them, according to Carl Maier,
assistant superintendent of the
building and grounds department.
Searsville Lake, normally filled
to its 265-million gallon capacity
at this time of year, currently
holds just 90 million gallons,
Maier reported.
Felt Lake has 131 million gal
lons now, compared with its nor
mal for April of 330 million gal
lons, he added.
AND Lake Lagunita, usually
the scene of much fun and frolic
on the water during spring quar
ter, is drier than a convention of
the Women's Christian Temper
ance Union.
Ironically, the Lag boathouse
has just undergone its first gen
eral repair in decades. Aside from
a "mudrofollies" replacing the
usual Con Home Hydrofollies, the
lake apparently won't be used for
anything this spring except sun
set watching,
The official rain gauge at the
Corp. Yard shows Stanford with
5.75 inches of rain this year, com
pared with the normal amount of
13 or 14 at this time, Maier said.
Stanford's annual rainfall aver
ages between 15 and 16 inches.
WHEN rationing is placed in
operation, Post sairi, car washing
will have to stop. And Stanford
homeowners will bo asked to re
duce the amount of water they
use to nourish their lawns.
Leaky faucets around campus
will be tightened up wherever
found, he said, and all University
residents and departments will bo
asked to conserve water wherever
possible.
Stanford Fire Chief John Mars
ton reported he will intensify in
spection of Farm buildings and
will conduct a drive to remind liv
ing groups the department in
spects of the water crisis.
HE l)E( I.AKEI) "We have to
worry about water this year. We
don't have it." Ho noted that since
tho campus does not have water
meters, there is a natural ten

dency to use more water than
necessary.
He feels the grass fire season
might start earlier than normal
| because of the dry conditions, but
j doesn't expect undue difficulty
j fighting fires.
Hopes for any appreciable
j amount of rain arc almost non
; existent, since April usually
j brings only showers, as the song
goes, and after that there isn't
any real rain until late November
or early December.
MAIHR, declaring "We're about
j the worst off since 1924"—driest
j year recorded—predicted the Uni
-1 versity would be forced to buy
I water from the San Francisco
Hetch Hetchy water system some
time during the summer.
In an emergency, the Univer
sity's domestic supply can be han
dled through the link with the
Hetch Hetchy and a new $1,200,-
000 reservoir just built on the
campus.
