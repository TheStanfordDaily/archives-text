## Teaching Positions Offered in Africa 
### 
Stanford senior and graduate student applicants for teaching posi
tions in Africa next year should make appointments immediately for
preliminary interviews.
Interviews will be held today through Wednesday from 1 to 5
p.m. at either the Stanford Placement Service or the Africa Desk in

the lIR Shack for the purpose
of discussing conditions of service
for specific program teaching op
portunities and also to finish the
processing of application forms
for interested students.
The location of the interviews
will be posted this morning next
to interview signup sheets at the
Africa Desk.
A STANFORD faculty commit
tee will meet within the next.two
weeks to conduct interviews for
the nomination of Stanford candi
dates to African-American teach
ing positions in West Africa, and
to "Teachers for East Africa," an
ICA-financed program, conducted
by Columbia Teachers College.
As the outcome of a telephone
conversation and letter exchange
between Dr. Dudley Boyce, direc
tor of the Stanford Placement
Service, and Dr. Freeman Butts,
director of "Teachers for East
Africa," Columbia may send a
representative to Stanford for
final screening of applicants. A
similar arrangement has been in
dicated by officials of the AAI.
COLUMBIA Teachers College
has contracted with four East
African governments for training
and placement of teaching candi
dates from the United States. Of
150 candidates, 30 will teach in
Kenya, 70 in Tanganyika, 40 in
Uganda and 1.0 in Zanzibar.
Candidates will be drawn from
three groups: A) 60 teachers who
have secondary teaching experi
ence, B) 40 liberal arts graduates
of the Class of '61, C> 50 students
who will have teaching creden
tials but no teaching experience.
Groups Band C will receive nine
months' training before teaching
for a period of two years in sec
ondarv schools.
MINIMUM salary is $3,200
yearly, and persons interested in
a teaching career are especially
urged to apply.
Butts stated that Richard Lake,
a provisional education officer
from Kenya who visited Stanford
last fall, has made a special re
quest for Stanford candidates.
Teachers are especially needed in
physics, chemistry, history, biolo
gy, mathematics, geography, and
English. Butts staled that living
and health conditions are gener
ally satisfactory.
Draft boards will probably
grant deferments for overseas
work of this nature, according to
officials in Washington.
THE AAI, a non-profit organi
zation which has been recruiting
teachers at the request of African
governments for some years, is
seeking candidates or positions in
Guinea, Ghana and Nigeria.
Other Eastern colleges, particu
larly Wesleyan and Harvard, will
send substantial delegations.
Transportation and salary for
teachers are paid by the host gov
ernments and a repatriation al
lowance is sot aside by the AAI
at the rate of $600 for single and
$1,000 for married teachers for
use of these teachers on their re
turn from Africa.
GUINEA has requested some

3,500 to 7,500 French-speaking
students to teach the subjects of
mathematics, general science,
physics, chemistry, biology and
English.
Fluency in French should be
"pretty good'' according to AAI
officials, and a summer orienta
tion program including intensive
French is being sought by the
AAI through the English Lan
guage Service in Washington and
through other sources.
There are at present 200 Com
munist teachers in Guinea, said
Gordon P. Hagberg, director of
the AAl's Washington office, "but
our purpose, of course, is not in
U.S. propaganda, but rather in
providing a useful and practical
service to the people of Africa."
GHANA and Nigeria both want
teachers in a variety of academic
disciplines. Ghana has 88 open
ings according to AAI represen
tatives and has specified that the
candidate must have a minimum
of 30 semester hours in the aca
demic discipline he will teach.
Stanford, in conjunction with
Yale, is seeking special agree
ments for teacher placement with
the governments of Ghana and
Northern Nigeria.
Many other job opportunities
are available at Stanford, and in
terested and qualified students
may have the opportunity to en
list in these work projects at a
later date.

turn from Africa.
GUINEA has requested some

3,500 to 7,500 French-speaking
students to teach the subjects of
mathematics, general science,
physics, chemistry, biology and
English.
Fluency in French should be
"pretty good'' according to AAI
officials, and a summer orienta
tion program including intensive
French is being sought by the
AAI through the English Lan
guage Service in Washington and
through other sources.
There are at present 200 Com
munist teachers in Guinea, said
Gordon P. Hagberg, director of
the AAl's Washington office, "but
our purpose, of course, is not in
U.S. propaganda, but rather in
providing a useful and practical
service to the people of Africa."
GHANA and Nigeria both want
teachers in a variety of academic
disciplines. Ghana has 88 open
ings according to AAI represen
tatives and has specified that the
candidate must have a minimum
of 30 semester hours in the aca
demic discipline he will teach.
Stanford, in conjunction with
Yale, is seeking special agree
ments for teacher placement with
the governments of Ghana and
Northern Nigeria.
Many other job opportunities
are available at Stanford, and in
terested and qualified students
may have the opportunity to en
list in these work projects at a
later date.
Stanford senior and graduate student applicants for teaching posi
tions in Africa next year should make appointments immediately for
preliminary interviews.
Interviews will be held today through Wednesday from 1 to 5
p.m. at either the Stanford Placement Service or the Africa Desk in

the lIR Shack for the purpose
of discussing conditions of service
for specific program teaching op
portunities and also to finish the
processing of application forms
for interested students.
The location of the interviews
will be posted this morning next
to interview signup sheets at the
Africa Desk.
A STANFORD faculty commit
tee will meet within the next.two
weeks to conduct interviews for
the nomination of Stanford candi
dates to African-American teach
ing positions in West Africa, and
to "Teachers for East Africa," an
ICA-financed program, conducted
by Columbia Teachers College.
As the outcome of a telephone
conversation and letter exchange
between Dr. Dudley Boyce, direc
tor of the Stanford Placement
Service, and Dr. Freeman Butts,
director of "Teachers for East
Africa," Columbia may send a
representative to Stanford for
final screening of applicants. A
similar arrangement has been in
dicated by officials of the AAI.
COLUMBIA Teachers College
has contracted with four East
African governments for training
and placement of teaching candi
dates from the United States. Of
150 candidates, 30 will teach in
Kenya, 70 in Tanganyika, 40 in
Uganda and 1.0 in Zanzibar.
Candidates will be drawn from
three groups: A) 60 teachers who
have secondary teaching experi
ence, B) 40 liberal arts graduates
of the Class of '61, C> 50 students
who will have teaching creden
tials but no teaching experience.
Groups Band C will receive nine
months' training before teaching
for a period of two years in sec
ondarv schools.
MINIMUM salary is $3,200
yearly, and persons interested in
a teaching career are especially
urged to apply.
Butts stated that Richard Lake,
a provisional education officer
from Kenya who visited Stanford
last fall, has made a special re
quest for Stanford candidates.
Teachers are especially needed in
physics, chemistry, history, biolo
gy, mathematics, geography, and
English. Butts staled that living
and health conditions are gener
ally satisfactory.
Draft boards will probably
grant deferments for overseas
work of this nature, according to
officials in Washington.
THE AAI, a non-profit organi
zation which has been recruiting
teachers at the request of African
governments for some years, is
seeking candidates or positions in
Guinea, Ghana and Nigeria.
Other Eastern colleges, particu
larly Wesleyan and Harvard, will
send substantial delegations.
Transportation and salary for
teachers are paid by the host gov
ernments and a repatriation al
lowance is sot aside by the AAI
at the rate of $600 for single and
$1,000 for married teachers for
use of these teachers on their re
turn from Africa.
