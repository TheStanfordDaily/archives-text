# Sharp Earthquake Shakes Bay Area, Sleeping Stanford
## Buildings Shaken on Campus; Extensive Damage in South 
### 
Stanford and the Bay Area were hit by a rocking, rolling earth
quake Saturday night which also caused extensive property damage
in Hollister, about 70 miles south of Stanford on the notorious San
Andreas Fault.
No damage was reported on campus or the area surrounding it,

but Hollister suffered much prop
erty damage.
The first rolling jolt came at
11:23 p.m. and was felt for nearly
a minute. Then, three minutes
later, came the second shock,
which was described by Hollister
Deputy Sheriff Clinton Dessel as
a "real snapper," United Press
International reported. In all, the
quake, though mostly unfelt, last
ed 18 minutes.
"THAT ONE really made you
sit up and take notice," Dessel
said, "The first roll just seemed
like a warning for the sudden
snap that came next. I don't mind
telling you I was scared. It's the
worst quake I've ever felt."
The University of California
seismograph station at Berkeley
reported the first shock had a
magnitude of 5.8 on the Richter
scale, while the second shock reg
istered at 5.5. Seismologist Alan
Ryall described both as "fairly
strong." The temblors were felt
as far north as San Rafael, 15
miles north of San Francisco, and
Paso Robles, 210 miles south.
Students in Stanford dormitor
ies reported feeling the quake,
which awakened some sleepers
and shook the buildings.
ONE GIRL sitting in a car in
front of .Roble said "I've never
been so frightened in my life."
She said the jolt rocked the car.
The rocking motion was reported
by all who felt the quake.
One person in the top bunk of
a bed in Toyon reported he was
brought out of a sound sleep by
what he thought was his room
mate in the bunk below violently
shaking the bed.
A Daily staffer in the Daily
Shack said he didn't feel the trem
or but figured there must have
been an earthquake when he
watched a wooden box "walk"
about a foot across the floor,
about 11:25.
ONE STUDENT who lives in
Palo Alto said he felt his room
"rock back and forth." He said
he was "scared as hell" because
he feared the 500 beer cans
stacked on a small ridge on the

wall might come tumbling down
and "wake up the whole apart
ment building." They stayed put.
Aside from rattling dishes, win
dows and stopping The Chronicle
presses for a minute, the quake
did no damage in the Bay Area.
In Hollister, however, no imme
diate estimate could be made of
the damage because it was so ex
tensive, although no buildings
were shaken down, UPI reported.
AT LEAST four of the tallest
buildings in the city—the court
house, the Elks building, and the
Dabo and Holland hotel s—suf
fered large cracks that may dam
age them permanently. Damage
to c h imney s in many private
homes was reported.
Almost every grocery and
liquor store in town suffered dam
age when bottled and canned
goods were shaken and jarred
from shelves, causing extensive
breakage.
The force of the quake was
such that power lines were jolted
together, sending up sparks and
flashes of light which were seen
for miles around.
The temblor came within 10
days of the 55-year anniversary of
the great earthquake and fire in
San Francisco in 1906 which oc
curred on April 16.
OTHER cities which felt the
quake included Berkeley, Hay
ward, Moraga, San Mateo, Menlo
Park, San Jose. Watsonville, Mon
terey—all of them roughly along
the line of the San Andreas Fault.
The fault is one of the largest
fault systems in the world. It ex
tends from Cape Mendocino, south
of Eureka in Humboldt County,
about 875 miles south to the Gulf
of California, bisecting the state
and passing just west of the
Golden Gate.
