# Elections Committee Refuses Two 'Off-Campus' Nominees
## 
### FRANCES FISHER 
Assistant Managing; Editor
A controversy concerning quali
fications for nomination began
when David Kratter and A 1 Alex
ander filed for Off-Campus Men's
Representative.
The two nominees, both pres
ently living in Stern, are Phi
Gamma Delta's and plan to be liv
ing off-campus next year.
However, on the grounds that
they are not living off-campus,
Elna Rodenhouse, Chairman of
the Elections Committee, refused
to accept their nominations, stat
ing. "They are welcome to appeal
the question to legislature."
James McGee has entered his
name as the fourth candidate
competing for ASSU president.
Both Robert Mathewson and Da
vid Kelly have indicated they will
join the presidential race, al-J
though they have not yet filed!
petitions.
Two people have announcedj
their candidacy for Men's Coun
cil: Steve Humphrey and John
Barnes.
Joan Murray has filed for Class
of '62 Vice President. i

Due lo a complication on the
signatures of their petitions,
Steve Pursell and Irv Nikolai
have decided not to run for Men's
Council.
These two candidates had al
most the same signatures on their
petitions as Alan Bolton, Vic
Preisscr and Mark Roper. Since
signatures on petitions indicate
that a voter plans to vote for that
candidate, no one may sign more
petitions for an office than there
are positions open for that office.
Thus, those signatures of peo
ple who had signed five petitions
were invalid. However, with Pur
well and Nikolai declining, the sig
natures on the other petitions are
now valid.
Nominations close tomorrow at
5 p.m. after which a meeting of
all the candidates will be held in
Room 320. Geology Corner at 7
p.m.
Any girls wishing to know
more about the job and duties of
the ASSU Vicc President should
see Sandy McCarty. She can be
contacted through the ASSU of
fice or by phoning 1)A 3H(ilfl.
