# Peace Corps Fails To Meet Potential
## 
### 
A corps of experts, intensively trained in language and customs,
to be sent abroad to aid underdeveloped countries could be an effec
tive tool in winning the cold war with the Soviet Union.
Recognizing the potential of such a task force and acting to fulfill
a campaign promise, President Kennedy recently established the
Peace Corps on a temporary basis. Unfortunately the plan as out
lined to Congress and set up under executive authority does not
measure up to its potential.
The main strength of the Peace Corps is that it is a masterpiece
of propoganda. Yet young Americans going into the Peace Corps
must not let this "peace propaganda" confuse them as to the real
purpose of the organization. Clearly there can be only one purposeâ€”
the promotion of the national interests of the United States, which
means in this instance the defeat of Communism. What is accom
plished in the way of improved living standards must be viewed
only as a means to this end. Unless Peace Corps members realize
this purpose and marshall all their efforts toward it, the work of the
organization will fail. Unfortunately, too many people who have ex
pressed an interest in the Peace Corps have disavowed any other
purpose but altruism.
The second area in which the Kennedy plan fails is the remark
ably short length of the training program. As outlined by the presi
dent, the program includes a training program of six weeks to six
months. During this period, trainees are to be completely grounded
in the language, customs, social mores, and institutions of the coun
tries to which they are to be sent. How all this can be accomplished
in six months or less is hard to understand, particularly in view of
the fact that the State Department will not send anyone abroad with
out 27 months of training. UNESCO, likewise, reguires an 18-month
training period. From the length of training for the Peace Corps, it
can only be concluded that corpsmen will be sent abroad illprepared
for their tasks.
Vibrantly idealistic youth going off to volunteer for the Peace
Corps can be likened to the Children's Crusades of the 13th Century.
Led by a visionary French peasant boy, Stephen of Cloyes, thou
sands of children embarked from Marseilles, hoping that they could
succeed where their elders had betrayed the cause of recapturing
the Holy Land. They were sold into slavery by unscrupulous skip
pers. Another group made up of German children went eastward by
land. Illprepared for their journey, most perished from hunger and
disease. Inadequate training in the Peace Corps cannot help but make
this modern movement as disastrous as those ancient missions of
folly.
