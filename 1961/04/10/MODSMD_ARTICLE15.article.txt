The Arizona Republic
Currently languishing in Congress is a proposal (HR 2708 and
Senate Bill 822) to establish a Freedom Academy, for the purpose of
training Americans and nationals of other free countries in the sci
ence of political warfare.
Despite support from men as apart in their political thinking as
Senators Goldwater and Douglas, and despite its having passed the
Senate last year, the Freedom Academy bill died in the House be
cause of pressure from the justice and state departments, which
claimed it duplicated existing efforts. This, as Sen. Thomas Dodd has
pointed out, is untrue, for no existing government training center is
staffed or designed to handle the task proposed for the Freedom
Academy. And until such an academy is established, wherein a staff
of experts and necessary facilities are coordinated under one roof,
the present piecemeal approach will continue and the U.S. will con
tinue to drift aimlessly.
Judged on past government efforts to counter the Red threat,
there is no guarantee that the academy would be effective, or that
it would adequately train its students. Certainly the state department
and intelligence schools leave a good deal to be desired. But, be
cause something certainly must be done, and because this appears
to have potential, it would seem the best approach for providing an
intellectual foundation for understanding the political, economic, and
military designs of the enemy.
The Communist Party has operated political warfare schools for
years. In addition to the famed Lenin Institute of Political Warfare,
the Academy of Red Professors, and the Sun Yat-sen University
(also called the Far Eastern University), the Party today operates
numerous training centers for Latin Americans, African labor lead
ers, students from Guinea, and for military, labor, race, church, and
guerrilla-political specialists. This is in keeping with Lenin's plan
that with an organization of professional revolutionaries—people who
would give to the revolution "not their spare evenings, but the whole
of their lives"—he could transform the world.
The Freedom Academy proposal has been endorsed by many
major organizations (AFL-CIO, Reserve Officers' Association) and by
a number of publications (National Review, Saturday Evening Post,
Life). At a time when we are faced with the greatest peril in our his
tory, it would be a shocking indictment of the American people, and
of their elected representatives, if they once again allowed the pro
posal to die in Congress.

intellectual foundation for understanding the political, economic, and
military designs of the enemy.
The Communist Party has operated political warfare schools for
years. In addition to the famed Lenin Institute of Political Warfare,
the Academy of Red Professors, and the Sun Yat-sen University
(also called the Far Eastern University), the Party today operates
numerous training centers for Latin Americans, African labor lead
ers, students from Guinea, and for military, labor, race, church, and
guerrilla-political specialists. This is in keeping with Lenin's plan
that with an organization of professional revolutionaries—people who
would give to the revolution "not their spare evenings, but the whole
of their lives"—he could transform the world.
The Freedom Academy proposal has been endorsed by many
major organizations (AFL-CIO, Reserve Officers' Association) and by
a number of publications (National Review, Saturday Evening Post,
Life). At a time when we are faced with the greatest peril in our his
tory, it would be a shocking indictment of the American people, and
of their elected representatives, if they once again allowed the pro
posal to die in Congress.
The Arizona Republic
Currently languishing in Congress is a proposal (HR 2708 and
Senate Bill 822) to establish a Freedom Academy, for the purpose of
training Americans and nationals of other free countries in the sci
ence of political warfare.
Despite support from men as apart in their political thinking as
Senators Goldwater and Douglas, and despite its having passed the
Senate last year, the Freedom Academy bill died in the House be
cause of pressure from the justice and state departments, which
claimed it duplicated existing efforts. This, as Sen. Thomas Dodd has
pointed out, is untrue, for no existing government training center is
staffed or designed to handle the task proposed for the Freedom
Academy. And until such an academy is established, wherein a staff
of experts and necessary facilities are coordinated under one roof,
the present piecemeal approach will continue and the U.S. will con
tinue to drift aimlessly.
Judged on past government efforts to counter the Red threat,
there is no guarantee that the academy would be effective, or that
it would adequately train its students. Certainly the state department
and intelligence schools leave a good deal to be desired. But, be
cause something certainly must be done, and because this appears
to have potential, it would seem the best approach for providing an
intellectual foundation for understanding the political, economic, and
military designs of the enemy.
