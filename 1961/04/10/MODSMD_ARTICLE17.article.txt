# ILENE STRELITZ
## Thou Shalt Not Kill 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.
the Nazis and the .Tows once again
face each other, or more cor
rectly, one Nazi and the Jews.
And it seems a shame that lor the
perverted life of one no-good—
Adolph Eiehmann — the Israelis
should sacrifice the respect they
have gained throughout the world
for coming so close to retrieving
a sterile desert into a dream of a
land of "milk and honey" as they
have.
Eiehmann will he put in a bullet
and grenade proof glass cage/wit
ness box and tried for "crimes
against the Jews." And he will he
found guilty, as he would be the
first to firmly admit he is.
And because of his verdict, and
possible — no, probable — death,
will the free world, the world that
despises Hitler, tyranny, and prej
udice, breathe a deeper breath of
purer air? Or will it merely be
an air just a bit more polluted
with the rancid odor of another
slain?
EICHIWANN was one of Hit
ler's masters of the concentration
camps who was named at the Nu
remberg trials. He eluded the
grasp of the victors at the trials
and fled to Argentina where he
was kidnapped by the Israelis and
is to be brought to trial in their
country under a law contrived ex
pressly for him and his ilk.
In objective terms of judicial
proceeding, a man was brought
by illegal means from one coun
try to a second to be tried for a
crime committed in a third, by a
court in which the prosecution,
the 'judge, and the jury are one
and the same. The Israeli stand,
if they actually felt it need be
pursued in this manner, should
have been put into the hands of a
neutral group—neither Germans
or Israelis—on the order of the
International Court.
The same problem came up pre
vious to the Nuremberg trials,
but the free world was indignant
and appalled; we wanted but
vengeance, and vengeance we got
as the executors of the atrocities
were condemned to death.
BUT THE WORLD still has
hate in it; we just added some
more. We didn't accomplish any
thing of lasting import at Nurem
berg, nor will the Israelis at the
Beit Ha'am, in which the trial is
being held.
The results of the trial could be
quite contrary to the intent of the
young nation. For one thing Nazi
versus Jew brought to the fore
once again could well serve to
bring out any latent anti-Semi
tism in the world; for another,
the Israelis, a country surrounded
on all sides by hostility directed
against it, could lose some of the
much needed respect of the free
world.
Already pickels in front of the

courthouse in Israel have men
tioned the names of former Na/is
who are now aids in various ca
pacities to Konrad Adenauer, a
man who is an important bastion
of the free world in a divided land.
CERTAINLY the Nazis weie
wrong. And people have come to
recognize it, and fear and prevent
the time of thinking that can
breed such a vicious creature as
racism and prejudice. Would the
slaying of Eichmann under the
present circumstance enhance
such a forcibly learned lesson? Or
would the Israelis accomplish
their purpose to a much greater
degree, as they refuse to turn
Eichmann over to an Interna
tional Court, by not returning a
verdict of death? Would not such
an action by the Israelis do much
more to combat the Ihings Eich
mann stands for?
They'd just be acting on a very
simple, ancient principle:
"Thou shalt not kill."

of the free world in a divided land.
CERTAINLY the Nazis weie
wrong. And people have come to
recognize it, and fear and prevent
the time of thinking that can
breed such a vicious creature as
racism and prejudice. Would the
slaying of Eichmann under the
present circumstance enhance
such a forcibly learned lesson? Or
would the Israelis accomplish
their purpose to a much greater
degree, as they refuse to turn
Eichmann over to an Interna
tional Court, by not returning a
verdict of death? Would not such

They'd just be acting on a very
simple, ancient principle:
"Thou shalt not kill."
Tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.
the Nazis and the .Tows once again
face each other, or more cor
rectly, one Nazi and the Jews.
And it seems a shame that lor the
perverted life of one no-good—
Adolph Eiehmann — the Israelis
should sacrifice the respect they
have gained throughout the world
for coming so close to retrieving
a sterile desert into a dream of a
land of "milk and honey" as they
have.
Eiehmann will he put in a bullet
and grenade proof glass cage/wit
ness box and tried for "crimes
against the Jews." And he will he
found guilty, as he would be the
first to firmly admit he is.
And because of his verdict, and
possible — no, probable — death,
will the free world, the world that
despises Hitler, tyranny, and prej
udice, breathe a deeper breath of
purer air? Or will it merely be
an air just a bit more polluted
with the rancid odor of another
slain?
EICHIWANN was one of Hit
ler's masters of the concentration
camps who was named at the Nu
remberg trials. He eluded the
grasp of the victors at the trials
and fled to Argentina where he
was kidnapped by the Israelis and
is to be brought to trial in their
country under a law contrived ex
pressly for him and his ilk.
In objective terms of judicial
proceeding, a man was brought
by illegal means from one coun
try to a second to be tried for a
crime committed in a third, by a
court in which the prosecution,
the 'judge, and the jury are one
and the same. The Israeli stand,
if they actually felt it need be
pursued in this manner, should
have been put into the hands of a
neutral group—neither Germans
or Israelis—on the order of the
International Court.
The same problem came up pre
vious to the Nuremberg trials,
but the free world was indignant
and appalled; we wanted but
vengeance, and vengeance we got
as the executors of the atrocities
were condemned to death.
BUT THE WORLD still has
hate in it; we just added some
more. We didn't accomplish any
thing of lasting import at Nurem
berg, nor will the Israelis at the
Beit Ha'am, in which the trial is
being held.
The results of the trial could be
quite contrary to the intent of the
young nation. For one thing Nazi
versus Jew brought to the fore
once again could well serve to
bring out any latent anti-Semi
tism in the world; for another,
the Israelis, a country surrounded
on all sides by hostility directed
against it, could lose some of the
much needed respect of the free
world.
Already pickels in front of the

courthouse in Israel have men
tioned the names of former Na/is
who are now aids in various ca
pacities to Konrad Adenauer, a
man who is an important bastion
