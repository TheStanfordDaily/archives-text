## Soviets Use Laos 'Peace Conference As Tactical Advice to Achieve Ends

II is dangerous to assume that
a "peace" conference will bring
peace to Laos.
Of course negotiations are de
sirable. But in light of our experi
ence in Korea and in Indo-China,
we face a long, tortuous road be
fore we know whether the free
dom of Laos can be secured at the
conference table.
There is no evidence that either
the Soviet Communists or the

I Chinese Communists really want
an independent, neutral Laos. We
need to bear in mind that the So
viets use a conference as a tacti
cal device to achieve their ends
one way instead of another. The
most revealing statement of Com
munist intentions is the recent
Moscow manifesto and Premier
Khrushchev's speech expounding
the manifesto.
Here is what they said:
1) "Wars of national libera
tion," as in Korea, Vietnam, Al
geria, and Laos are "scared"
I wars, are justifiable, desirable,
ad never ended until there is a
j Communist government.
21 The Communists see the an
ti-colonial movement as insepara
! ble from the "class struggle for
i communism."
3) Any no-Communist regime is
per se illegitimate and therefore
, should be overthrown. This means
that the Commuists view the
! elected governmet of Laos as ille
gitimate. Their aim is to over
throw it with pro-Communist re
bel forces supported by Soviet
j arms.
4) The Khrushchev version of
"peaceful co-existence" does not
! accept the "status quo" until a
i Communist regime is part of the
J status quo. Therefore, the Soviet
' backed effort to bring down the
! elected government of Laos is. to
1 Moscow and Peiping, not a viola
tion of "peaceful co-existence" but
an expression of it.
The "differences" between Mos-
I cow and Peiping on these matters

lis that the Chinese Communists I
may be willing to take more risks, j
Often you hear people comfort
ably say, "As long as you keep
jthem (the Communists) talking,
i I hey're not fighting." On this
point Dean Acheson rightly warns
in his article in the "Saturday
Evening Post":
"Nothing could be more untrue, i
They are fighting. They are
adopting a tactic specifically pre
scribed by Lenin to delay the cri-j
ses while demoralizing and weak
ening the enemy. To our minds
international conferences and in-;
ternational negotiations are so'
completely a means for ending I
conflict that we are blind to the
| fact that they may be, and in the
hands of experts are, equally l
! adapted to continuing it."
There was no reason to be sur-1
I prised about the Soviet response
1 to the proposal for a cease-fire I
and negotiation. 11 was familiar;
It was familiar; they wanted to ,
! turn it around — negotiate and i
ithen maybe a cease-fire. Even if
I the Soviets approve a cease-fire, |
j there is no assurance that the:
i pro-Communist forces in northern
! Laos will cease firing.
There are other pitfalls. The ;
1 Soviets may agree to a cease-fire I
i while the Red Chinese take over |
i the fighting. This may look like
ja conflict of interest between Red
China and the Soviet Union, but it
will more likely be a pattern of
concerted conquest.
It is to be hoped that a real
cease-fire can be brought, about.
But the cease-fire will have to be
thoroughly policed by mutual
agreement and we should be pre
pared to break off negotiations if
the cease-fire is violated.
