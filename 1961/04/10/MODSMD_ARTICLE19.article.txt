## Daily Sports 
### KEN DERY Sports Editor 
San Jose State easily captured
the triangular meet at Stanford
Stadium Saturday, but the Cards
gained some satisfaction as (hey
upset the Sooners from Oklaho
ma. 74-56, in dual meet competi
tion.
7..100 sundrenched spectators
watched the Spartans run up 69
points 1o 46 5/6 for Oklahoma and
46 1/6 for Stanford.
Coach Bud Winter's strong
Spartan team whipped Stanford,
SI '^-49'1-, and Oklahoma, 72-59, in
the other dual meets.

NO NEW world records were
established, but there were
enough fine performances to keep
everybody happy.

Dennis Johnson of San Jose,
with photographers flanking the
starting blocks, burst to a 9.4 hun
dred. Last week Occidental Coach
Chuck C'oker had hollered that
Johnson's start was illegal and a
big controversy followed. Satur
day the fleet Jamaican's start was
letter perfect.
ONE OF the highlights of the
day was the upset of Johnson in
the 220. Spartan teammate Willie
Williams, running in his last
sprint before limiting himself to
the 440. fashioned the stunning
upset. It was junior Johnson's
first setback after 13 straight
sprint firsts.
Card Art Batchelder drew a
roar from the crowd almost as
the meet started as he hurled the
javelin 233-3, his career best, in
his first try. Batchelder's throw
held up as he gained revenge on
San Jose's Dan Studney <228-2).
Studney had twice beaten Batchel
der in earlier meets.
Smooth-striding Dan Moore of
Stanford leaped to a new persona)
high of 24-1 in the broad jump to
capture that event, edging Soon
ers Don Warrick and Steve Swaf
ford.
RICH KLIER, Card co-captain,
took first in the half mile and ran
a brilliant anchor on the winning
mile relay team. The crew cut
junior started a few yards behind
Oklahoma's Bob Wilcox and ran
most of the quarter mile, stride
for stride, on the-Sooner's outside.
Klier made his move on the far
turn, forced Vyilcox to take the
outside and then outlasted the
Sooner in the straightaway for
the tape.
Stanford's Chris Hungerland,
bowed out for the season with an
outstanding effort. He has been
advised to hang up his spikes be
cause of serious bone spurs in a
toe joint. With the foot tender
and getting inflamed. Chris could
manage only a fourth in the 440,
but gave it all in the mile relay
and made up 15 yards on his Ok
lahoma opponent to keep the
Cards in the xace.
Coach Pay ton Jordan was
pleased with his Indians. "I'm
real happy to see the boys re
warded for all their hard "work.
It feels good to have beaten Okla
homa," he said.
