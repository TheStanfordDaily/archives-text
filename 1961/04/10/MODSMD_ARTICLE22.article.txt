# Indians Beat Pepperdine Twice
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford's varsity baseball team ran its season's record to 11-5
with a pair of impressive victories Friday and Saturday over power
i ful Pepperdine, 3-1 and 7-2.
In the Saturday game, Stanford went ahead in the second inning
on Hal Schutzman's run-scoring single. The Waves came back to tie

the score when right fielder Greg
! Post dropped Bob Williams' long,
I towering fly ball. Williams went
I to third, where he scored on Ray
j Wrenn's single.
i STANFORD went ahead in the
I third for keeps, as Skip Lawrence
! belted a ball to the fence in right j
| centerfield for a triple. John Hurl-;
I but followed moments later with
a tremendous clout that went
high on the fence at just about
the same place as Lawrence's hit
and bounced over the Pepperdine
| outfielders toward the infield,
j Hurlbut beat the relay home for
j an inside the park home run.
| Another Stanford run followed
in the fourth, when Schutzman
was hit in the neck by a Morris
Yates' pitch. Schutzman stole sec
ond. and came home on Law
rence's double.
Pepperdine threatened in the
sixth inning on an error and re
liever Darrell Sutherland's wild
ness, but Terry Llndeman came
in and made pinch-hitter Larry
Craig hit into a bases-loaded
pitcher to catcher to first double
play to end the threat with only j
one run scored.
STANFORD wrapped up the j
game with three runs in the sev
enth inning. Hurlbut walked, and
i Mike Magee was hit in the head
| by another Yates pitch. Yates hit
three batters in all, and two of
them scored. Ferrazzano singled
to score Hurlbut and send Magee
to third. He stole second. Yates
threw a wild pitch to score Magee,
with Ferrazzano going to third,
i Ferrazzano later scored on Lee
| Moench's fly.
| Friday's game, won by Stan
j ford 3-1 was a pitcher's duel all
j the way. Jim Smith and Marv
i Mecklenburg allowed only four
! Pepperdine hits, while striking
I out 11.
Stanford got all its runs in the
! third inning. Lawrence opened
i the frame with a single. Hurlbut
I and Magee followed with one bas
i ers to score Lawrence and put
j Hurlbut on second. Ferrazzano
i also singled, and Hurlbut scored
j when the Wave third baseman
i missed a throw to pick him off
| sliding back into third. Magee
i scored on Moench's sacrifice fly.
CARD shortstop Joel Shulman
I was the defensive star, making
i several fine plays, including start
; ing two double plays Saturday to
save the Stanford pitching staff's
|bacon.
Overall, the pitching was out

standing, as Pepperdine got only
one eared run in both games.
Lawrence continued his team
leading average with four hits in
the two games. Ferrazzano and
Hurlbut also got four hits for Ihe
week-end's work.
