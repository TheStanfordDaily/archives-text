# Hall Explains Activity Credit
## 
### 
Registrar Harvey Hall has
issued the following state
ment regarding activity cred
it:
"There has been some con
fusion concerning the man
ner in which students should
sign up for 1-unit classes
which may also be taken for
zero units in satisfaction of
the activity requirement.
"In the future all students
must fill out their study list
cards clearly showing at the
time of registration whether
the course is taken for credit
or in satisfaction of the activ
ity requirement by showing
in the units column either
"1" or "0" respectively.
"This decision cannot be
changed after the usual date
for revising study lists. This
does not change the existing
requirement that one physi
cal activity must be taken in
the first year and one physi
cal activity in the second
year, and six activities must
be totally completed as a part
of the baccalaureate pro
gram."
