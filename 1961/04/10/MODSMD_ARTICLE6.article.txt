# Worker Buried in Excavation Earth Collapse
## 
### 
A laborer working on the new
Varian physics lab at Physios Cor
ner was almost buried alive in a
cave-in Friday morning.
Carl Salloe, 29, was saved by
the quick action of two fellow
workers, who pulled him from a
ditch 11 feet deep located close by
the Outer Quad at Physics Cor
ner.
Sallee was working in the ditch,
to be used for a new sewer line,
when the dirt caved in around the
shoring he was putting in at
about 9 a.m.
As the dirt poured over him he
screamed for help.
Two follow workers rushed
over, leaped into the ditch and
began digging with shovels and
keeping Sallee's head up so he
could get air.
Other workers called the Stan
ford Fire Department and lent as
sistance.
The firemen provided ropes
which were lied around the
trapped man's waist and then
used to pull him out of the hole.
Fire Chief John Marston and Fire
Capt. Harry Lund helped drag
Sallee out of the hole.
Marston called the action of the
two workmen who jumped to Sal
lee's aid—Daniel Sanchez and Leo
Zunigha—"very heroic."
Sallee was laken to the Stan
ford-Palo Alto Hospital, where his
only reminder of the incident was
a slightly injured left leg. Fol
lowing treatment, he was allowed
to co.
