# Speculation Grows On Russ Spaceman
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPI) —Usually reliable but unofficial sources last
night said Russia may have launched a man into space for the first
time and brought him back alive.
A manned Russian space flight would give the Soviet Union a
victory in the space race with the United States and would be a

major breakthrough in space ex
ploration. Radio and TV person
nel were ordered on a 24-hour
alert for an important announce
ment, and scientists told friends
to stand by for earth-shaking
news. But there was no official
confirmation or denial of the man
in space report.
THE MAIN Moscow radio news
bulletin last night made no men
tion of the report. It was believed
any announcement might be de
layed until at least tomorrow.
By midnight the excited specu- j
lation touched off by the reports
showed no signs of dimming and j
official confirmation still was i
generally believed imminent.
As the report spread, more and j
more Russians believed it. These
signs tended to lend substance to ;
it:
• SPACESHIP IV, weighing
five tons, was orbited and brought
back safely with the dog "Blackie"
aboard alive and well last March
9.
• Spaceship V, also weighing
five tons, orbited the earth once
i with the dog "Starlet" aboard on
March 25 and was brought safely
back to a pre-designated target in
Russia.
• Premier Nikita S. Khru
shchev said last month "The time
is not far off" when the first |
i Russian will be sent into space.
ONE REPORT, without. any j
confirmation, was that a Russian
astronaut had been brought back
from space and now was under-1
going examination by physicians, j
All of the dogs brought back
alive showed no ill effects, scien
tists have stated.
Moscow newsmen began what
amounted to a Cape Canaveral-:
style "birdwatch."
RUSSIAN camera and TV
crews arrived at the central tele
graph office where foreign cor- ;
respondents file their dispatches. I
There was speculation the crews
were there to record reaction as a j
major story broke.
