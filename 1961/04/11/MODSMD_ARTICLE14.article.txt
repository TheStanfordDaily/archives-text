### MISS ELIZABETH M. HANNA Former Director of Branner Hall 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Tliis is the first of three articles concerning the
spnsoring of freshman women. Articles tomorrw and Thursday
will he written by a sponsor and by a freshman women.)
The primary purpose of the sponsor is. I believe, to orient and
inform the new freshmen of the Stanford traditions, philosophy, reg
ulations, mores and opportunities and to help them adjust to these
things.
Most would agree to this purpose, but how to accomplish it is a
much more complex question. In their orientation of the freshmen,
the sponsors find that giving information is their most immediate

Members of the sponsor-choosing committee will be in the
living groups at 6:45 p.m. tomorrow to answer any questions
about sponsoring. Applications for sponsoring will be available
at that time or in the ASSU Office Thursday and are due at noon
Monday. Applicants should sig up for an interview time at the
office as soon as possible.

job. This is something concrete which offers a definite sense oJ
completion and satisfaction to the sponsor. Similar rewards art
obtained from helping the freshmen with the many personal am
social problems which develop.

| It is very unfortunate that for many sponsorsâ€”and non-sponsors
| this is the extent of sponsor responsibilities. The vast majority of
i problems and challenges inherent in the sponsor position rest in
ihose facets of ihe job which are neither concrete, easily defined
j nor immediately rewarding.
The sponsor must recognize the fact that in orienting the fresh
i men to the University the sponsor is defining the University for
i them.
The sponsor makes her definition in a vast number of wayfe,
directly and verbally by straight giving of information and advice,
or indirectly by her behavior and example. The latter method is
the most important by far and the most difficult one for the sponsor
to handle.
Because of her personal contact and closeness in age with the
freshmen, the sponsor often becomes a model, and if is vitally im
portant to the freshmen that the sponsor is one who had defined
for herself a rich, extensive, and realistic University experience.
In selecting individuals to fill the position of sponsor it is impor
tant, then, to got students with the intelligence, ability, flexibility
; and emotional stability to go far beyond the immediate concrete
I demands of the job. Sponsoring can be as broad and as dynamic
i as iho opportunities and challenges to be found in Ihe University and
1 in the human beings with whom the sponsor works.
It is the responsibility of each sponsor, to the freshmen, the
; University, and to herself, to realize the potentials inherent in Ihe
J sponsoring opportunity.
