# 5 Compete for President; 15 Offices Lack Nominees
## Off-Campus Nominees to Ask LASSU Approval of Position 
### FRANCES FISHER Assistant Managing Editor 
Robert Mathewson officially announced his candidacy for ASSU
president yesterday, boosting the number of official candidates for
the presidency to five.
Although the competition for the presidency is heavy, many of
the 22 available ASSU offices had only one candidate running for

them and 15 positions had no ap
plicants as of yesterday. Nomi
nations close today at 5 p.m.
The controversy concerning A 1
Alexander and David K ratter,
two Stern men who desire to run
for off-campus representative,
will be presented to the Legisla
ture on Thursday. These two men
do not belong to the Phi Gamma
Delta Fraternity as reported in
yesterday's Daily.
The controversy arose when
Elna Rodenhouse. chairman of
the Elections Committee, refused
to accept the nominations of these
candidates on the grounds that
they are not now living off-cam
pus.
In support of her decision,
Chairman Rodenhouse quoted the
clause in the By-Laws under Qual
ifications for Voting," which
states "Living group Legislature
representatives shall be elected by
the residents of their respective
living groups at the time of elec
tion."
THE DISAGREEMENT centers
around the word "their" in the
above clause, which Miss Roden
house interprets to mean "the
living groups of the candidates
running for office." In this case
the clause would mean that since
these men now live in Stern,
"their respective living groups at
the time of election" are the men
in Stern.
On the othtr side. Kratter and
Alexander interpret the "their"
to refer to the voters rather than
the nominees since the clause ap
pears under the section "Qualifi
cations for Voting" and not under
"Nominations." Under this inter
pretation. their running for off
campus representatives while liv
ing in Stern would not be in con
flict with the constitution.
KRATTER and Alexander cite
Article 111. Section 1 of the ASSU
Constitutoin as further support
ing their stand. The section states
"Each representative shall be a
resident of the living area or a
member of the academic division
from which he is elected at the
time he is representing them."
Since the two men plan to live
off-campus next year, this clause
does not conflict with the Stern
men's plans. The two stated "since
this clause is in the Constitution
rather than the By-Laws, where
the clause supporting Miss Roden
house's stand is found, it takes
precedence over any subordinate
clause in the By-Laws."
THE 15 POSITIONS without
candidates include representatives

from Men's Row, Lagunita, Union
and Women's Row. The four
available AWS offices had no ap-
I plicants and of the four positions
open in the WRA only Barbara
Donati has filed for president.
No one was nominated for pres
ident or vice president of the
Class of '63 or for Vice President
of the Class of '64.
Only Roanna Crawford and
Jean McDermoth have filed for
the three positions open on Wom
en's Council.
Nominees to date other than
those mentioned include: Jim
Shekoyan, Bob Sayler, Jim Mc-
Gee, Bob Mathewson and Lawrie
Chickering for ASSU President;
Martha Sweeney for ASSU Vice
President.
Running for the three Men's
Council offices are Vic Preisser,
Alan Bolton, Mark Ropers, Steve
Humphreys and John Barnes.
Jay Tinsman, Bob Philibosian,
Bob Oaks, Charles Warner, Frank
Kemerer and William Callison are
competing for Stern Representa
tive.
Nominee for representative
from ICC-Toyon is Dick Weinig
and for representative from Moore
is Emilita Anderson.
Mitch Milias is running for
President of the Class of '62 and
Joan Murray and Kaye Bonner
are competing for Vice President
of that class.
John McCarthy has filed for
Class of '64 President.
A referendum will be on the
ballot asking the voters, "Shall
the Stanford rooting section be
integrated for all football
games?" If a majority of the
votes cast favor the change, it
will be adopted.
Concerning the problem of the
five candidates who filed for
Men's Council with almost the
same signature on each petition,
Ihe incorrect statement was made
that a voter plans to vote for a
candidate if he signs his petition.
What a signature on a petition
does indicate is that "a person is
casting his vote to nominate a
candidate," according to chair
man Rodenhouse.
