## Adlai Stevenson Emerges As Top Diplomatic Figure 
### 
Viewed from both Washington
and the U.N., Ambassador Adlai
Stevenson is emerging as a pow
erful figure in the Kennedy ad
ministration.
This does not mean that the
President is not making the final
decisions on policy. This does not
mean that Secretary of State
Dean Rusk is being detoured as
Mr. Kennedy's principal adviser
on foreign affairs.
IT DOES mean that, on the
basis of his experience, initiative,
and political prestige at home and
abroad, Mr. Stevenson is exerting
unusually wide influence in the
State Department and the White
House.
Whatever coolness there may
have been in the past, Mr. Steven
son and Mr. Kennedy are now
establishing a good working rela
tionship. As a consequence the
President's U.N. Ambassador is
today at the center of policy
formulation.
Every delegate here is under in
structions from his government, i
Mr. Stevenson is, too. But to a I
notable extent his recommenda-!
tions shape his instructions. And
beyond that his views on the
widest range of foreign policy
carry great weight in the top
councils of the Administration.
It was at Ambassador Steven
son's initiative that the U.S. for
the first time voted with the Afro-
Asian nations in their anti
colonial resolution on Angola.
IT WAS Mr. Stevenson, in part
because of his long personal ac
quaintance with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, who
was called upon to conduct the |
delicate and important negotia
tions for resuming the disarma
ment talks with the Russians.
When British Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan was in Wash
ington this past week to meet
with President Kennedy. Mr. i
Stevenson took part as well as !
Secretary Rusk.

Mr. Kennedy needs Stevenson
in his administration. The Presi
dent is aware of his close election,
wants to keep the support of Ad
lai's followers. In addition, Mr.
Stevenson, through his wide trav
els, has gotten to know personally
more world leaders Ihan anyone
in the Administration including
the President. This is invaluable
for his job as Ambassador at the
U.N. He also brings his gift of
articulate speech to the U.N., per
haps the best forum for Mr.
Stevenson's talents.
All of these things give Mr.
Stevenson a voioe in Cabinet de
liberations and a degree of access
and influence with the President
which is exceptional.
In his job at the U.N. Mr.
Stevenson is at many points doing
things differently than did Am
bassador Henry Cabot Lodge. He
is initiating breakfast, luncheon,
| and dinner sessions with the
j heads of all the 99 delegations,
| sometimes including wives. For
the first time Stevenson as U.S.
representative let it be known
that he would be available to meet
with the caucus of the Afro-
Asian nations on a common mat
ter. They invited him at once.
THERE IS ONE intriguing
thread of sameness-plus-differ
ence between the Governor and
his predecessor. As U.N. Ambas
sador Mr. Lodge was, to a degree,
seeking to make his political repu
tation while Mr. Stevenson is
seeking to conserve his political
reputation.
It is premature to guess what
Mr. Stevenson's record will look
like when it takes fuller shape.
But at this point he is proving a
powerful advocate of U.S. policy
within the IJ.N. and an influential
: spokesman for his own views
i within the Kennedy administra
i tion.

seeking to conserve his political
reputation.
It is premature to guess what
Mr. Stevenson's record will look

But at this point he is proving a
powerful advocate of U.S. policy
within the IJ.N. and an influential

Viewed from both Washington
and the U.N., Ambassador Adlai
Stevenson is emerging as a pow
erful figure in the Kennedy ad
ministration.
This does not mean that the
President is not making the final
decisions on policy. This does not
mean that Secretary of State
Dean Rusk is being detoured as
Mr. Kennedy's principal adviser
on foreign affairs.
IT DOES mean that, on the
basis of his experience, initiative,
and political prestige at home and
abroad, Mr. Stevenson is exerting
unusually wide influence in the
State Department and the White
House.
Whatever coolness there may
have been in the past, Mr. Steven
son and Mr. Kennedy are now
establishing a good working rela
tionship. As a consequence the
President's U.N. Ambassador is
today at the center of policy
formulation.
Every delegate here is under in
structions from his government, i
Mr. Stevenson is, too. But to a I
notable extent his recommenda-!
tions shape his instructions. And
beyond that his views on the
widest range of foreign policy
carry great weight in the top
councils of the Administration.
It was at Ambassador Steven
son's initiative that the U.S. for
the first time voted with the Afro-
Asian nations in their anti
colonial resolution on Angola.
IT WAS Mr. Stevenson, in part
because of his long personal ac
quaintance with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, who
was called upon to conduct the |
delicate and important negotia
tions for resuming the disarma
ment talks with the Russians.
When British Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan was in Wash
ington this past week to meet
with President Kennedy. Mr. i
Stevenson took part as well as !
Secretary Rusk.

Mr. Kennedy needs Stevenson
in his administration. The Presi
dent is aware of his close election,
wants to keep the support of Ad
lai's followers. In addition, Mr.
Stevenson, through his wide trav
els, has gotten to know personally
more world leaders Ihan anyone
in the Administration including
the President. This is invaluable
for his job as Ambassador at the
U.N. He also brings his gift of
articulate speech to the U.N., per
haps the best forum for Mr.
Stevenson's talents.
All of these things give Mr.
Stevenson a voioe in Cabinet de
liberations and a degree of access
and influence with the President
which is exceptional.
In his job at the U.N. Mr.
Stevenson is at many points doing
things differently than did Am
bassador Henry Cabot Lodge. He
is initiating breakfast, luncheon,
| and dinner sessions with the
j heads of all the 99 delegations,
| sometimes including wives. For
the first time Stevenson as U.S.
representative let it be known
that he would be available to meet
with the caucus of the Afro-
Asian nations on a common mat
ter. They invited him at once.
THERE IS ONE intriguing
thread of sameness-plus-differ
ence between the Governor and
his predecessor. As U.N. Ambas
sador Mr. Lodge was, to a degree,
seeking to make his political repu
tation while Mr. Stevenson is
seeking to conserve his political
reputation.
