Long Ago
The Daily editorials of Ihe last
few months have represented
some of the most brilliant think
ing of the thirteenth century, hut
Monday's edit on the alleged evils
of the Peace Corps wasn't even
good thirteenth century thinking.
While working for Senator Hu
bert Humphrey in Washington
last year, 1 drafted the legislation
for the original Peace Corps bill
and thus have some familiarity
with the issues that the editorial
raises. The falsity of the facts the
piece presents compounds the fal
sity of the conclusions derived
therefrom.
One point should be made quite
clear. Those who will be selected
to serve in the Peace Corps will
be accepted only after a rigorous
screening, and only a small per
cent of the applicants will be ac
cepted. They will be selected on
the basis of dedication to the
ideals of the Peace Corps, of hav
ing a very real skill to contribute,
and on demonstrating a political
and emotional maturity. In short,
those inducted will be the very
cream of the crop.
The editorial states that there
will be a training period of from
six weeks to six months, but that
does not take into account the
additional training that will take
place in the country where the
Peace Corps members will serve.
The directors of the Peace Corps
are not only idealistic, but also a
hard-nosed lot of realists who are
aware of the fact that no one
should be sent to work in an en
tirely different culture without
adequate preparation.
The editorial infers that the
only justifiable purpose of the
Peace Corps is to stop Commu
nism and says that "too many
people who have expressed an in
terest in the Peace Corps have
disavowed any other purpose but
altruism." What an unspeakable
crime! I would dare to suggest
that the most important item of
export that this country has is
its ideals. The day that we lose

the Cold War will be the day
when we think only in negative
terms of stopping Communism
and not in positive, creative terms
of helping to stimulate those
types of conditions in which we
would like to see Ihe rest of man
kind live. If Marx and Lenin had
never lived, there would si ill be
just as much need for the Peace
Corps.
It would be a refreshing change
if, once in awhile, the Daily edi
torial writers could be dragged,
kicking, screaming, into the twen
tieth century.

Victorian Age
As one who has just been af
fected by the women's sign-out
system here at Stanford (to the
extent—and cost—of a dozen red
roses) I have, I believe, a legiti
mate though possibly vested in
terest in it. I consider the system
outmoded, even Victorian in con
cept, and totally ineffective other
than as a balm to negligent
parents' concern.
Parents, I think, have a respon
sibility to inculcate within their
daughters a certain sense of pro
priety in childhood, be it moral or
merely practical. Once their
daughters have reached a rela
tively mature age—say college
age for the sake of argument—
they should be allowed, even en
couraged, to manage their own
lives—and that means setting
their own hours. If the parents
have failed in their responsibility,
no amount of l:3o's, 2:3o's, 3:l4's
or whatever, will protect their
offspring from whatever (to be
carefully periphrastic) these ri
diculous and annoying rules are
intended to prevent.
The University, as far as I'm
concerned, would show itself to
be far mofe consistent with its
stated aims of aiding its students
to develop both intellectually and
socially by abolishing this system
—and using the above explana
tion to ward off outraged parents.
