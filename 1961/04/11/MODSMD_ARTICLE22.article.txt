Model Paper
Mr. W. B. Wood's letter last
week castigated The Daily for
opening its eyes too wide, that is,
for carrying news about, and com
menting on, events which oc
curred beyond the confines of the
Farm. At first reading, it seemed
naive. Read a second time. Mr.
Wood appeared to be serious, and
his invectives seemed to require
some sort of rebuttal.
Mr. Wood mentioned that Stan
ford students should obtain all of
their knowledge of current events,
social trends, politics, etc.,
through the local mass media out
side the University. One certainly
can. But he fails to realize that
constructive, critical, incisive
thought on these current affairs
from the student viewpoint must
be expressed through the campus
paper. The Daily does not en
deavor 1o "substitute" for these
media. It serves as a supplement,
bringing to bear on current af
fairs the advantages and disad
vantages—of a student view.

Mr. Wood presenter! the reader
with his ideas concerning a model
college newspaper. His descrip
tion reminded one of the little two
page mimeographed newspapers
J published by many grade schools
| for their own consumption. They,
too, are concerned with "proper
journalism," "correct and effec
' live use of the English language,"
and "reporting of community
events." Like the mural painted
in the hall by the fourth grade.
A lack of "articles dealing with
current and historical aspects of
student life and university insti
! tut ions" was decried by Mr. Wood.
He obviously missed the excellent,
scholarly series of articles deal
ing with the Hoover Institution,
which, incidentally, supplanted in
every instance one of the edi
torials which Mr. Wood so ab
hors.
The fact that the Letters-to-the-
Editor section represents student
opinion on vital, world-shaking
issues also troubled Mr. Wood.
He wanted letters 4 to he from
would-be critics or educators, not
would-be world-reformers. Appar
ently the realization, that the

views expressed by students in
their newspaper are as diverse a«
the personalities from which they
come, has not struck Mr. Wood.
The logical conclusion of Mr.
Wood's views expressed in policy
would be a four-page daily news
paper re-titled, Once Around the
Quad. Such a revision of present
policy would obviously be unde
sirable and impossible. One half
expects, some sunny afternoon
next week, to see Mr. Wood, type
writer in hand, mimeograph ma
chine slung under one arm, trudg
ing up the Row toward the corner
of Mayfield and Santa Ynez to
cover the story of ofur newly
hatched chickens in Miss Clark's
third grade class.

journalism," "correct and effec

and "reporting of community
events." Like the mural painted
in the hall by the fourth grade.
A lack of "articles dealing with
current and historical aspects of
student life and university insti
! tut ions" was decried by Mr. Wood.
He obviously missed the excellent,
scholarly series of articles deal
ing with the Hoover Institution,
which, incidentally, supplanted in
every instance one of the edi
torials which Mr. Wood so ab
hors.
The fact that the Letters-to-the-
Editor section represents student
opinion on vital, world-shaking
issues also troubled Mr. Wood.
He wanted letters 4 to he from
would-be critics or educators, not
would-be world-reformers. Appar
ently the realization, that the

views expressed by students in
their newspaper are as diverse a«
the personalities from which they
come, has not struck Mr. Wood.
The logical conclusion of Mr.
Wood's views expressed in policy
would be a four-page daily news
paper re-titled, Once Around the
Quad. Such a revision of present
policy would obviously be unde
sirable and impossible. One half
expects, some sunny afternoon
next week, to see Mr. Wood, type
writer in hand, mimeograph ma
chine slung under one arm, trudg
ing up the Row toward the corner
of Mayfield and Santa Ynez to
cover the story of ofur newly
hatched chickens in Miss Clark's
third grade class.

Model Paper
Mr. W. B. Wood's letter last
week castigated The Daily for
opening its eyes too wide, that is,
for carrying news about, and com
menting on, events which oc
curred beyond the confines of the
Farm. At first reading, it seemed
naive. Read a second time. Mr.
Wood appeared to be serious, and
his invectives seemed to require
some sort of rebuttal.
Mr. Wood mentioned that Stan
ford students should obtain all of
their knowledge of current events,
social trends, politics, etc.,
through the local mass media out
side the University. One certainly
can. But he fails to realize that
constructive, critical, incisive
thought on these current affairs
from the student viewpoint must
be expressed through the campus
paper. The Daily does not en
deavor 1o "substitute" for these
media. It serves as a supplement,
bringing to bear on current af
fairs the advantages and disad
vantages—of a student view.

Mr. Wood presenter! the reader
with his ideas concerning a model
college newspaper. His descrip
tion reminded one of the little two
page mimeographed newspapers
J published by many grade schools
| for their own consumption. They,
too, are concerned with "proper
journalism," "correct and effec
' live use of the English language,"
and "reporting of community
events." Like the mural painted
