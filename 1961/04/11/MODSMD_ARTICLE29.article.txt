the Masters' golf championship
yesterday when defending cham
pion Arnold Palmer faltered on
the final hole just as it seemed he
had ihe title won.

er, doubled bogeyed the last hole
- the par four, 420-yard 18th, as
Player, who had faltered on his
back nine, sat in the clubhouse.

and bogeyed tlie 15th to come in
