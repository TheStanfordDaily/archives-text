# Eichmann Up Before Israeli Court Today
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (UPIi — Adolf
Eichmann was left alone with his
conscience in a bare prison cell
last night to await the morning
and the start of his trial for the
biggest mass murder in history.
Scores of police and soldiers
patrolled the prison - courthouse
housing both the prisoner and the
room where he will be tried in a
bullet-proof glass cage. Guards
with tommy guns marched behind
a 10-foot wire mesh fence erected
around the square, concrete build
ing in the Israeli sector of Jeru
salem.
Soldiers stood on the roof of
the building. Others were in the
corridors and in the courtroom all
with one order:
Keep Eichmann alive and safe
during the trial which may end
with him sentenced to death for
"crimes against humanity and the
Jewish people."
Authorities feared Jews still
living in nightmares the horrors
of such camps as Auschwitz,
where three million Jews died,
might try to shoot the prisoner or
attack him during the trial.
The trial will open before three
Israeli judges, themselves, Ger
man-born and German-educated,
as Eichmann was.
Eichmann, 58, pasty from lack
of sunlight and gone to fat from
the starchy prison fare and lack
of exercise, was reported being
kept either in a fourth-floor cell
or in a subterranean cell of the
courthouse.
He will be brought to and from
the courtroom by a secret stair
case in the concrete walls, enter
ing his glass and steel cage in the
courtroom by a special door built
into the wall. Two guards will be
with him at every moment.
IN TIIE weeks — probably
months—that the trial will last,
Eichmann will sit there, listening
to his own 4,000 pages of state
ments, testimony from 39 wit
nesses and statements by the
judges and attorneys.
UNDER a 1950 law, punish
ment on conviction can be death
by hanging although Israelis are
divided on whether he should suf
fer that fate. For all other crimes
but treason in Israel, there is no
capital punishment.

the building. Others were in the
corridors and in the courtroom all
with one order:
Keep Eichmann alive and safe
during the trial which may end
with him sentenced to death for
"crimes against humanity and the
Jewish people."
Authorities feared Jews still
living in nightmares the horrors
of such camps as Auschwitz,
where three million Jews died,
might try to shoot the prisoner or
attack him during the trial.
The trial will open before three
Israeli judges, themselves, Ger
man-born and German-educated,
as Eichmann was.
Eichmann, 58, pasty from lack
of sunlight and gone to fat from
the starchy prison fare and lack
of exercise, was reported being
kept either in a fourth-floor cell
or in a subterranean cell of the
courthouse.
He will be brought to and from
the courtroom by a secret stair
case in the concrete walls, enter
ing his glass and steel cage in the
courtroom by a special door built
into the wall. Two guards will be
with him at every moment.
IN TIIE weeks — probably
months—that the trial will last,
Eichmann will sit there, listening
to his own 4,000 pages of state
ments, testimony from 39 wit
nesses and statements by the
judges and attorneys.
UNDER a 1950 law, punish
ment on conviction can be death
by hanging although Israelis are
divided on whether he should suf
fer that fate. For all other crimes
but treason in Israel, there is no
capital punishment.
