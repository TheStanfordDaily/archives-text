# Experts to Chart Nuclear Challenge
## 
### 
A two-day symposium on "The Challenge of the Nuclear Age"
at Stanford this week will present Harold Stassen, Linus Pauling,
Ithiel de Sola Pool, and other high-level experts.
The conference begins Friday at 4:15 p.m., with Matthew Sands,
Caltech specialist in electronic instrumentation for nuclear phys-

ics, discussing "Science and Pub
lic Affairs."
Till-; PROGRAM continues with
throe panel discussions on Satur
day which, like Sands' talk, will
bo open to the public free of
charge. Along with the speakers
alre a d y mentioned, physicists
Courtenay Wright, Leonard Schiff
and Wolfgang Panofsky and
chemist John Rasmussen will be
participating.
Saturday morning at 10 in Din
kelspiel Auditorium, Pauling will
open the panel discussion with re
marks on "The Goal of General
and Complete Disarmament.'''
At 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Din
kelspiel. Panofsky will open the
discussion with a talk on "Test
Ban in Relation to Arms Control
Measures."
FINAL PROGRAM for the pan
elists, with Stassen speaking on
"Government Organization for
Disarmament," will start at 7:30
p.m. Saturday in Memorial Audi
torium.
The conference has been ar
ranged by the Stanford Commit
tee on Public Exercises and the
Focus section of the Political
Union with sophomore, Cliff
Probst in charge.
Pauling, Caltech Nobel prize
winning chemist and physicist,
has long advocated a nuclear test
ban. Stassen was U.S. representa

ament Commission and presiden
tial adviser on control of nuclear
weapons in the Eisenhower ad
ministration.
POOL, at Stanford's Hoover In
stitution from 1949 to 1953, now
directs the Research Program of
International Communications at
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. Rasmussen is a nuclear
chemist at Berkeley specializing
in radioactive decay. Wright is a
physicist at the University of
Chicago, while Schiff heads Stan
ford's Department of Physics.
PANOFSKY, director of Stan
ford's high energy physics labora
tory. is a consultant to the Atomic
Energy Commission and a mem
ber of the President's Science Ad
visory Board. Last month he re
ceived the 1951 Ernest Orlando

bo open to the public free of
charge. Along with the speakers
alre a d y mentioned, physicists
Courtenay Wright, Leonard Schiff
and Wolfgang Panofsky and
chemist John Rasmussen will be
participating.
Saturday morning at 10 in Din
kelspiel Auditorium, Pauling will
open the panel discussion with re
marks on "The Goal of General
and Complete Disarmament.'''
At 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Din
kelspiel. Panofsky will open the
discussion with a talk on "Test
Ban in Relation to Arms Control
Measures."
FINAL PROGRAM for the pan
elists, with Stassen speaking on
"Government Organization for
Disarmament," will start at 7:30
p.m. Saturday in Memorial Audi
torium.
The conference has been ar
ranged by the Stanford Commit
tee on Public Exercises and the
Focus section of the Political
Union with sophomore, Cliff
Probst in charge.
Pauling, Caltech Nobel prize
winning chemist and physicist,
has long advocated a nuclear test
ban. Stassen was U.S. representa
tive to the United Nations Disarm
ament Commission and presiden
tial adviser on control of nuclear
weapons in the Eisenhower ad
ministration.
POOL, at Stanford's Hoover In
stitution from 1949 to 1953, now
directs the Research Program of
International Communications at
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. Rasmussen is a nuclear
chemist at Berkeley specializing
in radioactive decay. Wright is a
physicist at the University of
Chicago, while Schiff heads Stan
ford's Department of Physics.
PANOFSKY, director of Stan
ford's high energy physics labora
tory. is a consultant to the Atomic
Energy Commission and a mem
ber of the President's Science Ad
visory Board. Last month he re
ceived the 1951 Ernest Orlando
Lawrence Memorial Award for
his "outstanding contributions to
nuclear physics and international
control of nuclear testing."
A two-day symposium on "The Challenge of the Nuclear Age"
at Stanford this week will present Harold Stassen, Linus Pauling,
Ithiel de Sola Pool, and other high-level experts.
The conference begins Friday at 4:15 p.m., with Matthew Sands,
Caltech specialist in electronic instrumentation for nuclear phys-

ics, discussing "Science and Pub
lic Affairs."
