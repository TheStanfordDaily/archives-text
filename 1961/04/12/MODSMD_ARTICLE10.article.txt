### SHEILA RICKETTS 
Sir Charles Arden-Clarke. for
: mer governor of the Gold Coast
j and the first governor-general of
i Ghana, speaking last night in a
I Tuesday Evening Series presenta
| tion in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
discussed the progress of present
independent African nations and
made a comparison of past and
present colonial policies of the
European powers.
I In speaking of the many coun-
I tries which are rapidly emerging
! on the African continent, Arden-
Clarke stated, "They've got three
particularly difficult problems to
handle: tribalism, poverty, and
ignorance."
He pointed out that they will
get help for these three problems
from whatever source they can,
and that they will undoubtedly re
main neutral. He added, however.
"I believe too that in these new
countries there is much more
goodwill toward the West than to
iward the East."

Arden-Clarke predicted that the
type of government that will rule
the new African countries will be
a one-party government with
strong central control, "more au
tocratic than anything we would
tolerate." But he said, "They are
not Nazi, Fascist or Communist.
. . . We would make a mistake . . .
I if we regarded them as enemies
i instead of potential friends."
In comparing the policies of the
four colonial powers — Belgium,
Portugal, France, and Great Bri
tain—he said, "The Belgians failed
to insure thai there was a govern
ment left behind that was capable
of maintaining law and order, and
they walked out. Now we've got
the Congo."
He believes that if the Portu
guese are forced out of Angola
and Mozambique, there will be
two more Congos in Africa, for
the Portuguese, being a poor na-
J tion. haven't developed these eoun-
I tries enough for them to be in
-1 dependent nations.
