# ROBLE SPONSOR REPORTS
## Are Women's Sponsors Needed All Year? 
### LUCY AMES Roble Sponsor 
(Editor's Note: This is the second of three articles concerning
• freshman women sponsors. An article tomorrow will be written by
I a freshman woman.)

"We suggest that the sponsors ho girls who queen (date) more or
loss and know many men to facilitate introductions . . So reads
the report of the first women sponsors back in 192.1 In those days
the main job of a sponsor was to see to the social success of her
freshman charges.
Not so today! The present sponsor system is designed, in theory
at loast, to include much more than this. But just what, exactly, is
the role of a woman sponsor today? Is she a propaganda pusher who
hands out information in the first weeks of the year? Is •she a "tool"
of the administration? Is she a shoulder for the Frosh to cry on?
Simply an upperclass friend?
PROPOSED ANSWERS to such questions have led lo changes
in the sponsor system: expansion from one to two quarters, institu
tion of sponsor-weekend and sponsor prc-reg. This year too. Branncr
and Roble sponsors have contributed ideas based upon their ex
periences and their thoughts about a sponsor's role.
One of these ideas assigning corridors lo sponsor officers will
go into effect in the fall. Another a three-quarter sponsor program
is beiiiK tester! this spring on a limited basis, in Roble Hall, and
will be evaluated by all taking part.
THE RATIONALE III.lll.M) the program is this: if a sponsor
can contribute to the experience of the freshmen by living with them
as an "educated woman" and an upperclass friend, then why cut
short this relationship just when it is reaching its possible point of
greatest potential in the third quarter? The new plan includes spon
sor participation as the freshmen seek an academic, social and cul
tural program for the dorm designed to stimulate the interests and
broaden the opportunities of all.
The availability of individual sponsors to all freshmen will be
1 emphasized. Many of the sponsors themselves have had experiences,
such as Barbi Norman's in teaching in Alaska, or Susie Koessler's
in applying to grad school, which may be of interest to frosh outside
of their own corridors and will bo presented. Further value may be
found in the attempt now being made by sponsors and freshmen,
with the encouragement of faculty and administration, to improve
I I lie frosh curriculum.
{ HOTII TllE IDEA ol a three-quarter nrouram and its annlica

tion on an experimental basis this quarter, have met with a mixed
reaction from the student body. Opposition stems, in part, from a
common tendency to resist change. But there are more rational con
siderations. One is a vague but fairly substantial feeling that fresh
men mature throughout the year and that the natural outcome of this
growth should be "independence" during the third quarter.
Those who see possibilities in a three-quarter system whould argue
that this is a false notion. True, Ihe maturity of the frosh should
bo recognized spring quarter but it should be recognized long be
fore that! If the sponsor is a friend atid helper rather than a police
man or parent, then the freshmen should be treated as independent
individuals throughout the year. It might also be noted that spring
quarter in frosh women's dorms, for better or for worse, is the
only time in a Stanford coed's career when ati older student is not
available in her living group.
A second category of objections might be classified as "personal,"
and some of them are quite persuasive. For instance senior sponsors
may wish to return to their old living groups. Or there may be the
opportunity of going to a foreign campus in the spring-summer
session.
SUC H CONSIDERATIONS, it alleged, may bar a number of
possible candidates from applying to sponsor under a three-quarter
system. Weighed against this is the hope that persons interested in
both sponsoring and other major activities can plan ahead so that
all are possible for instance, attend a foreign campus in the sopho
more or junior year and sponsor as a senior. If the worth of the three
quarter program is proved, enough people should be found to carry
it through.
Sponsor applications are being distributed tonight, and prospec
tive applicants are. of course, interested in knowing whether they
are applying for a two- or three-quarter undertaking. The only honest
answer at present is "we don't know yet." The decision will depend
to a large extent on comparison of the experience of Roble under
a three-quarter system with Branner under a two.
A DECISION ON THIS basis naturally can't be reached for
I several weeks. Meanwhile ii is hoped that next week's sponsor ap
pli cants will be thinking about the matter, will remain reasonably
' open-minded about it until all the tacts ,ire in, and will contribute any
ideas which they may have.
Third-quarter availibility would ho desirable, but will not be a
! criterion in the choosing of next ye n's sponsors. The feelings of
ithis group will be considered in the making of the final decision as
to whether this idea is indeed worth putting into practice next year,

in applying to grad school, which may be of interest to frosh outside
of their own corridors and will bo presented. Further value may be

{ HOTII TllE IDEA ol a three-quarter nrouram and its annlica

tion on an experimental basis this quarter, have met with a mixed
reaction from the student body. Opposition stems, in part, from a
common tendency to resist change. But there are more rational con
siderations. One is a vague but fairly substantial feeling that fresh
men mature throughout the year and that the natural outcome of this
growth should be "independence" during the third quarter.
Those who see possibilities in a three-quarter system whould argue
that this is a false notion. True, Ihe maturity of the frosh should
bo recognized spring quarter but it should be recognized long be
fore that! If the sponsor is a friend atid helper rather than a police
man or parent, then the freshmen should be treated as independent
individuals throughout the year. It might also be noted that spring
quarter in frosh women's dorms, for better or for worse, is the
only time in a Stanford coed's career when ati older student is not
available in her living group.
A second category of objections might be classified as "personal,"
and some of them are quite persuasive. For instance senior sponsors
may wish to return to their old living groups. Or there may be the
opportunity of going to a foreign campus in the spring-summer
session.
SUC H CONSIDERATIONS, it alleged, may bar a number of
possible candidates from applying to sponsor under a three-quarter
system. Weighed against this is the hope that persons interested in
both sponsoring and other major activities can plan ahead so that
all are possible for instance, attend a foreign campus in the sopho
more or junior year and sponsor as a senior. If the worth of the three
quarter program is proved, enough people should be found to carry
it through.
Sponsor applications are being distributed tonight, and prospec
tive applicants are. of course, interested in knowing whether they
are applying for a two- or three-quarter undertaking. The only honest
answer at present is "we don't know yet." The decision will depend
to a large extent on comparison of the experience of Roble under
a three-quarter system with Branner under a two.
A DECISION ON THIS basis naturally can't be reached for
I several weeks. Meanwhile ii is hoped that next week's sponsor ap
pli cants will be thinking about the matter, will remain reasonably
' open-minded about it until all the tacts ,ire in, and will contribute any
ideas which they may have.
Third-quarter availibility would ho desirable, but will not be a
! criterion in the choosing of next ye n's sponsors. The feelings of
ithis group will be considered in the making of the final decision as
to whether this idea is indeed worth putting into practice next year,

the report of the first women sponsors back in 192.1 In those days
the main job of a sponsor was to see to the social success of her
freshman charges.
Not so today! The present sponsor system is designed, in theory
at loast, to include much more than this. But just what, exactly, is
the role of a woman sponsor today? Is she a propaganda pusher who
hands out information in the first weeks of the year? Is •she a "tool"
of the administration? Is she a shoulder for the Frosh to cry on?
Simply an upperclass friend?
PROPOSED ANSWERS to such questions have led lo changes
in the sponsor system: expansion from one to two quarters, institu
tion of sponsor-weekend and sponsor prc-reg. This year too. Branncr
and Roble sponsors have contributed ideas based upon their ex
periences and their thoughts about a sponsor's role.
One of these ideas assigning corridors lo sponsor officers will
go into effect in the fall. Another a three-quarter sponsor program
is beiiiK tester! this spring on a limited basis, in Roble Hall, and
will be evaluated by all taking part.
THE RATIONALE III.lll.M) the program is this: if a sponsor
can contribute to the experience of the freshmen by living with them
as an "educated woman" and an upperclass friend, then why cut
short this relationship just when it is reaching its possible point of
greatest potential in the third quarter? The new plan includes spon
sor participation as the freshmen seek an academic, social and cul
tural program for the dorm designed to stimulate the interests and
broaden the opportunities of all.
