# Depressed Areas Bill Equals Dole
## 
### 
In his inaugural address President Kennedy articulated his phi
losophy that "If a free society cannot help the many who are poor,
it cannot save the few who are rich." To implement his philosophy
he has sent a depressed areas bill to Congress. The bill would re
habilitate areas which have been plagued by long-run unemploy
ment. It does this by pouring more than $400 million in Federal funds
into these depressed areas.
Despite all the fanfare by the liberal supporters of the bill, it fails
as either a stop-gap or a long-term measure against unemployment.
Instead of providing employment it will merely shuffle unemploy
ment on a geographical basis. The bill, despite safeguards written
into it, encourages states and towns to attempt to steal industry away
from other states and towns. Furthermore, the bill errs in providing
aid in building new facilities for the industrial complexes of the
country when these cities, such as Detroit, have a surplus of plant
space—and it is not being used for lack of business. Lastly, only a
few people, one in seventeen, will be touched by the program.
All these conclusions make us think that the administration's bill
really doesn't get to the base of the unemployment problem. Areas
which are depressed for economic reasons will not become unde
pressed by his plan—unless the plan expands into a continued fed
eral subsidy such as the agricultural programs of New Deal fame.
This last supposition, of course, would provide none of the economic
growth we heard so much about during the campaign. It would
provide stagnation.
Many solutions are available which would help develop the de
pressed areas. A lifting of the excise tax on automobiles, a crash
program on coal uses, and job retraining programs are all sample
solutions. However, the biggest single assistance to unemployment
would be black ink in the federal budget which, with a surplus, would
make tax cuts possible. While such a plan would not directly help
those in depressed areas, it would provide growth in more dynamic
sections of the economy, thus attracting the unemployed from de
pressed areas into the more prosperous sections. The administration,
however, apparently believes that the dole creates more incentive
than old-fashioned opportunity.
