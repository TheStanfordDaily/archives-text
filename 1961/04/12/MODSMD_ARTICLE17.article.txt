# A 						Year of Crisis For Legislature
## 
### 
The year 1961 has so far proved a year of achievement for the
University—with the 525 million Ford grant symbolizing the giant
steps Stanford is taking to become a truly outstanding educational
institution. For student government, it has been a year of falling
behind, a year of crisis.
For this academic year has seen a new birth of serious student
interest both locally, on the serious aspects of a university educa
tion and internationally, in the realm of politics and education. We
see this in the freshman discussion group of the Fundamental Stand
ard, the Political Union's Focus program and the Institute of Inter
national Relation's pioneering work on the Peace Corps.
Unfortunately, throughout the year the central governing unit of
the student body, the Legislature, has seemed oblivious to the
changes going on about them; uncertain what action to take. This
uncertainly has thus produced no decision or what is worse retard
ing of decision. All too many of the Legislators seem to like to dress
in a tie and sit around the big table in Bowman Alumni House and
be verbally cute; there are all too few members who can see outside
this tunnel vision to the projects which the Legislature could tackle
—the lack of an infirmary, the academic problems of the University,
the cultural program of the University. Too many Legislative mem
bers have become defeatist-minded. They say that nothing can be
done in these areas. Yet at Harvard College the student council in
stigated a study of their General Studies program which in turn was
responsible for a faculty investigation which resulted not only in a
change in the curriculum but also a book on general education which
is read by college administrators throughout the country.
A look at those who filed for members of Legislature shows many
names of promise. Hopefully, in their campaigns, they will make
clear that they regard the Legislature and the central student govern
ment as a starting point for action and decision—not an ending point.
