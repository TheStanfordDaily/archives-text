# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## Founders' Service Belongs in Church 
### 
(Editor's note: The Daily, in |
this special instance, has lilted its
250-word maximum on letters to
the editor.)
Since The Daily is a student
paper, most of ils editorial opin
ions are written by and for Stan
ford students and properly should
he commented on by students
alone. Occasionally, however, mat
ters of deep concern to the
broader Stanford community, in
cluding alumni, faculty, and
friends of the University, are
treated and when this happens, as
in the editorials of March 6 and
10, 1961 on the Memorial Church
and Founders' Day, response from
a wider audience may be expected.
I am a Stanford alumnus who
graduated 30 years ago this June
before going on to advanced study
here and elsewhere. I have also
been a member of the Stanford
faculty for a total of 18 years. For
what it may be worth I should
like to take issues with the views
and the tone of the editorials
mentioned, especially that of
March (5.
THE WRITER of the editorial
of March 6, which was given the
title "Memorial Church Remem
bers Leland," presumably in an
embarrassingly dismal attempt to i
be clever, shows little knowledge
of the background of the Me
morial Church, or of Stanford
University for that matter, and
even less appreciation of the senti
ments behind Ihe Stanford en
dowment. It does not seem unrea
sonable to expect the editor of the i
Stanford Daily to get the facts i
straight and interpret them clear- j
ly, for there are many readily '
available sources of information. :
One of the easiest to obtain and
the most recent is a volume pub- ;
lished by the Stanford University ;
Press last year, "The Memoirs of |
Ray Lyman Wilbur, 1975-1945," :
under the editorship of Edgar Eu- j
gene Robinson and Paul Carroll i
Edwards, the former an active<
member of the faculty from 1911
to 1952 and the latter an alumnus j
and a longtime member and an
ex-president of the Stanford j
Board of Trustees. Dr. Wilbur, j
who entered Stanford with the |
second class and graduated in
1896, was the third president of
the University, serving from 1916
to 1943, except for four years as '
Secretary of the Interior in the |
Hoover Administration, 1929-1933.
He was exceptionally well quali
fied to speak, because he was here
almost from the beginning and
was well acquainted with Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, as ho was also
with his two predecessors and his
two successors in the presidency.
IN THE memoirs, p. 93, Dr. Wil
bur explains, "To Mrs. Stanford
the Church was more than a sa
cred place; it was her family
shrine and particularly a me
morial to her husband. In fact, the
pillars of the Church are inscribed
with names of members of ihc
family. It was the key building
of the University both in its posi
tion in the Inner Quadrangle and
in her own thoughts. She was'

deeply religious and was sus
tained throughout her sorrow and
bereavement by'her great faith.
She and her husband were broad
ly tolerant of all religions and de
nominations, and they wanted the
Memorial Church to be forever
nonsectarian and universal in its
appeal."
In his inaugural address (p.
204) Dr. Wilbur said, with refer
ence to Ihe Church, that Mrs.
Stanford "made it free from man
made creeds and varieties of re
ligion. . . . Let each man choose
his own method of worship, but
we can here give our students the
chance to hear the words of those
who seek to interpret the relig
ious thought and teachings of the
day or to guide us in the ethical
aspects of human conduct."
THE VIEW of religion and of
the Memorial Church in Stanford
life adopted from the outset by
the Stanfords and, 1 believe, car
ried on by all five of Stanford's
presidents is clearly a great deal
broader and more tolerant than
that of your March 6 editorial.
Stanford has grown with the
years and now has students not
only from all over Europe and
the Americas but also from Asia,
Africa, and Australia and Ihose
students represent many different
creeds. Yet, so broadly inclusive
and universal was the initial con
ception of this place of worship
that no change in policy has been
necessary and the Memorial
Church still welcomes all who
wish to worship there, regardless
of the name they give their God.
At the same time the Church re
mains "a family shrine and par
ticularly a memorial" to Senator
Stanford given to the University
by his wife. That is why, to quole
your editorial title again. "Me
morial Church Remembers Le
land," namely because it was a
memorial to the Senator, and it is
therefore entirely appropriate
that Founders' Day should be cele
brated there and that an address
about the Founders and what they
founded should be delivered there.
YOUR EDITORIAL contains
several inaccuracies and also
some statements which are ques
tionable in taste if in nothing else.
First, would it have been too
stuffy to have said "Senator Stan
ford" rather than "Leland" in
your title? The statement "If the
thought that this University was
founded stirs your heart, you
must wait until next year to do

anything about it," was doubtless
meant to be amusing. Perhaps it
is, but if so, it is only in a sopho
more way. To sneer that Dr. Bar
clay "seemed to bp an especially
qualified speaker since he is iho
great-grandson of a personal
friend of Leland Stanford" misses
the point as offensively as the
rest of the editorial, ft seems
more sensible 1o assume that
President Sterling asked Dr. Bar
clay to deliver the Founders' Day
address because he has bPen asso
ciated with the University for
over 30 years and is one of the
best-known and best-loved of
Stanford's professors. Universi-!
ties such as Stanford owe a great
deal to the unremitting service
and loyalty of devoted faculty
members of Professor Barclay's
stamp, but these are qualities
which the editor may not esteem
as highly as Dr. Sterling appar
ently does. Dr. Wilbur (Memoirs,
p. 20.")). perhaps naively, held that
one of the great features of the
kind of University Stanford as
pired to become "must be loyal
ty." The same could be of course
be said of most of Ihe more im
portant aspects of human life, in
the family, in the professions, in
public service, in politics, and in
government. To go on with the
errors, the first president of Stan
ford was "David," not "William" |

Starr Jordan. I am 6iire Dr. Bar
clay flirt not spell the word "sen
tamentalize," the form in which it
appears in the editorial, but per
haps this a typographical error.
It is true that Dr. Barclay did not
mention God in his address, but if
I heard aright, He was mentioned
frequently during the religious
part of the service.
IN YOUR editorial of March 10
you adopt a different line and at
titude. There is a moi-e serious
approach and there is also what
I take to be an attempt to gloss
over the factual mistakes of the
March (5 editorial concerning the
background of the Memorial
Church. There is the beginning
of a constructive idea, viz, the
possibility that a different kind of
Founders' Day program, might b<*
worked out, but it would have
been better to renounce more
openly the flagrant errors of the
earlier editorial. Your statement
that "The University should not
take advantage of a capacity Sun
day church audience to com
memorate the founders with an
address which, while perceptively
conceived and well delivered, was
out of place" is off the track. Ap
parently il did not occurr to you
that the "capacity Sunday church
audience" was well aware of the
nature of the function or that
many attended specifically be-

I cause it was the Founders' Day
â–  service. Moreover, some might al
ready have worshipped in the way
land at the times prescribed by
their own religions. As for the
remarks about the "perceptively
j conceived and well delivered" ad-
Id ress and the admonition to the
!"able" Committee on Public Ex
ercises lo work hard at their next
meeting, my only comment is
that it is wiser and more becom
ing for young people to avoid
i trying lo be either patronizing or
sarcastic.
I regret that my comments
have had to be so adversely criti
cal but we live in a community of
scholars and must describe things
as we see them. In any case it
seems not inappropriate to point
out that your opinions of Ihe
Church and the Founders' Day
program is not the only one cur
rent on ihe campus. If there are
I many students at Stanford who
! find the present method of honor
ling ihe Founders unsatisfactory,
there certainly is no reason why
they should not propose changes
but there seems to be no reason
why this could not be done with
out flippancy, inaccuracy, and dis
respect for those who made this
University and its great achieve
ments possible.

204) Dr. Wilbur said, with refer
ence to Ihe Church, that Mrs.
Stanford "made it free from man
made creeds and varieties of re
ligion. . . . Let each man choose
his own method of worship, but
we can here give our students the
chance to hear the words of those
who seek to interpret the relig
ious thought and teachings of the
day or to guide us in the ethical
aspects of human conduct."
THE VIEW of religion and of
the Memorial Church in Stanford
life adopted from the outset by
the Stanfords and, 1 believe, car
ried on by all five of Stanford's
presidents is clearly a great deal
broader and more tolerant than
that of your March 6 editorial.
Stanford has grown with the
years and now has students not
only from all over Europe and
the Americas but also from Asia,
Africa, and Australia and Ihose
students represent many different
creeds. Yet, so broadly inclusive
and universal was the initial con
ception of this place of worship
that no change in policy has been
necessary and the Memorial
Church still welcomes all who
wish to worship there, regardless
of the name they give their God.
At the same time the Church re
mains "a family shrine and par
ticularly a memorial" to Senator
Stanford given to the University
by his wife. That is why, to quole
your editorial title again. "Me
morial Church Remembers Le
land," namely because it was a
memorial to the Senator, and it is
therefore entirely appropriate
that Founders' Day should be cele
brated there and that an address
about the Founders and what they
founded should be delivered there.
YOUR EDITORIAL contains
several inaccuracies and also
some statements which are ques
tionable in taste if in nothing else.
First, would it have been too
stuffy to have said "Senator Stan
ford" rather than "Leland" in
your title? The statement "If the
thought that this University was
founded stirs your heart, you
must wait until next year to do

anything about it," was doubtless
meant to be amusing. Perhaps it
is, but if so, it is only in a sopho
more way. To sneer that Dr. Bar
clay "seemed to bp an especially
qualified speaker since he is iho
great-grandson of a personal
friend of Leland Stanford" misses
the point as offensively as the
rest of the editorial, ft seems
more sensible 1o assume that
President Sterling asked Dr. Bar
clay to deliver the Founders' Day
address because he has bPen asso
ciated with the University for
over 30 years and is one of the
best-known and best-loved of
Stanford's professors. Universi-!
ties such as Stanford owe a great
deal to the unremitting service
and loyalty of devoted faculty
members of Professor Barclay's
stamp, but these are qualities
which the editor may not esteem
as highly as Dr. Sterling appar
ently does. Dr. Wilbur (Memoirs,
p. 20.")). perhaps naively, held that
one of the great features of the
kind of University Stanford as
pired to become "must be loyal
ty." The same could be of course
be said of most of Ihe more im
portant aspects of human life, in
the family, in the professions, in
public service, in politics, and in
government. To go on with the
errors, the first president of Stan
ford was "David," not "William" |

Starr Jordan. I am 6iire Dr. Bar
clay flirt not spell the word "sen
tamentalize," the form in which it
appears in the editorial, but per
haps this a typographical error.
It is true that Dr. Barclay did not
mention God in his address, but if
I heard aright, He was mentioned
frequently during the religious
part of the service.
IN YOUR editorial of March 10
you adopt a different line and at
titude. There is a moi-e serious
approach and there is also what
I take to be an attempt to gloss
over the factual mistakes of the
March (5 editorial concerning the
background of the Memorial
Church. There is the beginning
of a constructive idea, viz, the
possibility that a different kind of
Founders' Day program, might b<*
worked out, but it would have
been better to renounce more
openly the flagrant errors of the
earlier editorial. Your statement
that "The University should not
take advantage of a capacity Sun
day church audience to com
memorate the founders with an
address which, while perceptively
conceived and well delivered, was
out of place" is off the track. Ap
parently il did not occurr to you
that the "capacity Sunday church
audience" was well aware of the
nature of the function or that
many attended specifically be-

I cause it was the Founders' Day
â–  service. Moreover, some might al
ready have worshipped in the way
land at the times prescribed by
their own religions. As for the
remarks about the "perceptively
j conceived and well delivered" ad-
Id ress and the admonition to the
!"able" Committee on Public Ex
ercises lo work hard at their next
meeting, my only comment is
that it is wiser and more becom
ing for young people to avoid
i trying lo be either patronizing or
sarcastic.
I regret that my comments
have had to be so adversely criti
cal but we live in a community of
scholars and must describe things
as we see them. In any case it
seems not inappropriate to point
out that your opinions of Ihe
Church and the Founders' Day
program is not the only one cur
rent on ihe campus. If there are
I many students at Stanford who
! find the present method of honor
ling ihe Founders unsatisfactory,
there certainly is no reason why
they should not propose changes
but there seems to be no reason
why this could not be done with
out flippancy, inaccuracy, and dis
respect for those who made this
University and its great achieve
ments possible.

Since The Daily is a student
paper, most of ils editorial opin
ions are written by and for Stan
ford students and properly should
he commented on by students
alone. Occasionally, however, mat
ters of deep concern to the
broader Stanford community, in
cluding alumni, faculty, and
friends of the University, are
treated and when this happens, as
in the editorials of March 6 and
10, 1961 on the Memorial Church
and Founders' Day, response from
a wider audience may be expected.
I am a Stanford alumnus who
graduated 30 years ago this June
before going on to advanced study
here and elsewhere. I have also
been a member of the Stanford
faculty for a total of 18 years. For
what it may be worth I should
like to take issues with the views
and the tone of the editorials
mentioned, especially that of
March (5.
THE WRITER of the editorial
of March 6, which was given the
title "Memorial Church Remem
bers Leland," presumably in an
embarrassingly dismal attempt to i
be clever, shows little knowledge
of the background of the Me
morial Church, or of Stanford
University for that matter, and
even less appreciation of the senti
ments behind Ihe Stanford en
dowment. It does not seem unrea
sonable to expect the editor of the i
Stanford Daily to get the facts i
straight and interpret them clear- j
ly, for there are many readily '
available sources of information. :
One of the easiest to obtain and
the most recent is a volume pub- ;
lished by the Stanford University ;
Press last year, "The Memoirs of |
Ray Lyman Wilbur, 1975-1945," :
under the editorship of Edgar Eu- j
gene Robinson and Paul Carroll i
Edwards, the former an active<
member of the faculty from 1911
to 1952 and the latter an alumnus j
and a longtime member and an
ex-president of the Stanford j
Board of Trustees. Dr. Wilbur, j
who entered Stanford with the |
second class and graduated in
1896, was the third president of
the University, serving from 1916
to 1943, except for four years as '
Secretary of the Interior in the |
Hoover Administration, 1929-1933.
He was exceptionally well quali
fied to speak, because he was here
almost from the beginning and
was well acquainted with Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, as ho was also
with his two predecessors and his
two successors in the presidency.
IN THE memoirs, p. 93, Dr. Wil
bur explains, "To Mrs. Stanford
the Church was more than a sa
cred place; it was her family
shrine and particularly a me
morial to her husband. In fact, the
pillars of the Church are inscribed
with names of members of ihc
family. It was the key building
of the University both in its posi
tion in the Inner Quadrangle and
in her own thoughts. She was'

deeply religious and was sus
tained throughout her sorrow and
bereavement by'her great faith.
She and her husband were broad
ly tolerant of all religions and de
nominations, and they wanted the
Memorial Church to be forever
nonsectarian and universal in its
appeal."
In his inaugural address (p.
204) Dr. Wilbur said, with refer
ence to Ihe Church, that Mrs.
Stanford "made it free from man
made creeds and varieties of re
ligion. . . . Let each man choose
his own method of worship, but

appears in the editorial, but per
haps this a typographical error.
It is true that Dr. Barclay did not
mention God in his address, but if
I heard aright, He was mentioned
frequently during the religious
part of the service.
IN YOUR editorial of March 10
you adopt a different line and at
titude. There is a moi-e serious
approach and there is also what
I take to be an attempt to gloss
over the factual mistakes of the
March (5 editorial concerning the
background of the Memorial
Church. There is the beginning
of a constructive idea, viz, the
possibility that a different kind of
Founders' Day program, might b<*
worked out, but it would have
been better to renounce more
openly the flagrant errors of the
earlier editorial. Your statement
that "The University should not
take advantage of a capacity Sun
day church audience to com
memorate the founders with an
address which, while perceptively
conceived and well delivered, was
out of place" is off the track. Ap
parently il did not occurr to you
that the "capacity Sunday church
audience" was well aware of the
nature of the function or that
many attended specifically be-

I cause it was the Founders' Day
â–  service. Moreover, some might al
ready have worshipped in the way
land at the times prescribed by
their own religions. As for the
remarks about the "perceptively
j conceived and well delivered" ad-
Id ress and the admonition to the
!"able" Committee on Public Ex
ercises lo work hard at their next
meeting, my only comment is
that it is wiser and more becom
ing for young people to avoid
i trying lo be either patronizing or
sarcastic.
I regret that my comments
have had to be so adversely criti
cal but we live in a community of
scholars and must describe things
as we see them. In any case it
seems not inappropriate to point
out that your opinions of Ihe
Church and the Founders' Day
program is not the only one cur
rent on ihe campus. If there are
I many students at Stanford who
! find the present method of honor
ling ihe Founders unsatisfactory,
there certainly is no reason why
they should not propose changes
but there seems to be no reason
why this could not be done with
out flippancy, inaccuracy, and dis
respect for those who made this
University and its great achieve
ments possible.

Since The Daily is a student
paper, most of ils editorial opin
ions are written by and for Stan
ford students and properly should
he commented on by students
alone. Occasionally, however, mat
ters of deep concern to the
broader Stanford community, in
cluding alumni, faculty, and
friends of the University, are
treated and when this happens, as
in the editorials of March 6 and
10, 1961 on the Memorial Church
and Founders' Day, response from
a wider audience may be expected.
I am a Stanford alumnus who
graduated 30 years ago this June
before going on to advanced study
here and elsewhere. I have also
been a member of the Stanford
faculty for a total of 18 years. For
what it may be worth I should
like to take issues with the views
and the tone of the editorials
mentioned, especially that of
March (5.
THE WRITER of the editorial
of March 6, which was given the
title "Memorial Church Remem
bers Leland," presumably in an
embarrassingly dismal attempt to i
be clever, shows little knowledge
of the background of the Me
morial Church, or of Stanford
University for that matter, and
even less appreciation of the senti
ments behind Ihe Stanford en
dowment. It does not seem unrea
sonable to expect the editor of the i
Stanford Daily to get the facts i
straight and interpret them clear- j
ly, for there are many readily '
available sources of information. :
One of the easiest to obtain and
the most recent is a volume pub- ;
lished by the Stanford University ;
Press last year, "The Memoirs of |
Ray Lyman Wilbur, 1975-1945," :
under the editorship of Edgar Eu- j
gene Robinson and Paul Carroll i
Edwards, the former an active<
member of the faculty from 1911
to 1952 and the latter an alumnus j
and a longtime member and an
ex-president of the Stanford j
Board of Trustees. Dr. Wilbur, j
who entered Stanford with the |
second class and graduated in
1896, was the third president of
the University, serving from 1916
to 1943, except for four years as '
Secretary of the Interior in the |
Hoover Administration, 1929-1933.
He was exceptionally well quali
fied to speak, because he was here
almost from the beginning and
was well acquainted with Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, as ho was also
with his two predecessors and his
two successors in the presidency.
IN THE memoirs, p. 93, Dr. Wil
bur explains, "To Mrs. Stanford
the Church was more than a sa
cred place; it was her family
shrine and particularly a me
morial to her husband. In fact, the
pillars of the Church are inscribed
with names of members of ihc
family. It was the key building
of the University both in its posi
tion in the Inner Quadrangle and
in her own thoughts. She was'

deeply religious and was sus
tained throughout her sorrow and
bereavement by'her great faith.
She and her husband were broad
ly tolerant of all religions and de
nominations, and they wanted the
Memorial Church to be forever
nonsectarian and universal in its
appeal."
In his inaugural address (p.
204) Dr. Wilbur said, with refer
ence to Ihe Church, that Mrs.
Stanford "made it free from man
made creeds and varieties of re
ligion. . . . Let each man choose
his own method of worship, but
we can here give our students the
chance to hear the words of those
who seek to interpret the relig
ious thought and teachings of the
day or to guide us in the ethical
aspects of human conduct."
THE VIEW of religion and of
the Memorial Church in Stanford
life adopted from the outset by
the Stanfords and, 1 believe, car
ried on by all five of Stanford's
presidents is clearly a great deal
broader and more tolerant than
that of your March 6 editorial.
Stanford has grown with the
years and now has students not
only from all over Europe and
the Americas but also from Asia,
Africa, and Australia and Ihose
students represent many different
creeds. Yet, so broadly inclusive
and universal was the initial con
ception of this place of worship
that no change in policy has been
necessary and the Memorial
Church still welcomes all who
wish to worship there, regardless
of the name they give their God.
At the same time the Church re
mains "a family shrine and par
ticularly a memorial" to Senator
Stanford given to the University
by his wife. That is why, to quole
your editorial title again. "Me
morial Church Remembers Le
land," namely because it was a
memorial to the Senator, and it is
therefore entirely appropriate
that Founders' Day should be cele
brated there and that an address
about the Founders and what they
founded should be delivered there.
YOUR EDITORIAL contains
several inaccuracies and also
some statements which are ques
tionable in taste if in nothing else.
First, would it have been too
stuffy to have said "Senator Stan
ford" rather than "Leland" in
your title? The statement "If the
thought that this University was
founded stirs your heart, you
must wait until next year to do

anything about it," was doubtless
meant to be amusing. Perhaps it
is, but if so, it is only in a sopho
more way. To sneer that Dr. Bar
clay "seemed to bp an especially
qualified speaker since he is iho
great-grandson of a personal
friend of Leland Stanford" misses
the point as offensively as the
rest of the editorial, ft seems
more sensible 1o assume that
President Sterling asked Dr. Bar
clay to deliver the Founders' Day
address because he has bPen asso
ciated with the University for
over 30 years and is one of the
best-known and best-loved of
Stanford's professors. Universi-!
ties such as Stanford owe a great
deal to the unremitting service
and loyalty of devoted faculty
members of Professor Barclay's
stamp, but these are qualities
which the editor may not esteem
as highly as Dr. Sterling appar
ently does. Dr. Wilbur (Memoirs,
p. 20.")). perhaps naively, held that
one of the great features of the
kind of University Stanford as
pired to become "must be loyal
ty." The same could be of course
be said of most of Ihe more im
portant aspects of human life, in
the family, in the professions, in
public service, in politics, and in
government. To go on with the
errors, the first president of Stan
ford was "David," not "William" |

Starr Jordan. I am 6iire Dr. Bar
clay flirt not spell the word "sen
tamentalize," the form in which it
appears in the editorial, but per
haps this a typographical error.
It is true that Dr. Barclay did not

and the tone of the editorials
mentioned, especially that of
March (5.
THE WRITER of the editorial
of March 6, which was given the
title "Memorial Church Remem
bers Leland," presumably in an
embarrassingly dismal attempt to i
be clever, shows little knowledge
of the background of the Me
morial Church, or of Stanford
University for that matter, and
even less appreciation of the senti
ments behind Ihe Stanford en
dowment. It does not seem unrea
sonable to expect the editor of the i
Stanford Daily to get the facts i
straight and interpret them clear- j
ly, for there are many readily '
available sources of information. :
One of the easiest to obtain and
the most recent is a volume pub- ;
lished by the Stanford University ;
Press last year, "The Memoirs of |
Ray Lyman Wilbur, 1975-1945," :
under the editorship of Edgar Eu- j
gene Robinson and Paul Carroll i
Edwards, the former an active<
member of the faculty from 1911
to 1952 and the latter an alumnus j
and a longtime member and an
ex-president of the Stanford j
Board of Trustees. Dr. Wilbur, j
who entered Stanford with the |
second class and graduated in
1896, was the third president of
the University, serving from 1916
to 1943, except for four years as '
Secretary of the Interior in the |
Hoover Administration, 1929-1933.
He was exceptionally well quali
fied to speak, because he was here
almost from the beginning and
was well acquainted with Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, as ho was also
with his two predecessors and his
two successors in the presidency.
IN THE memoirs, p. 93, Dr. Wil
bur explains, "To Mrs. Stanford
the Church was more than a sa
cred place; it was her family
shrine and particularly a me
morial to her husband. In fact, the
pillars of the Church are inscribed
with names of members of ihc
family. It was the key building
of the University both in its posi
tion in the Inner Quadrangle and
in her own thoughts. She was'

deeply religious and was sus
tained throughout her sorrow and
bereavement by'her great faith.
She and her husband were broad
ly tolerant of all religions and de
nominations, and they wanted the
Memorial Church to be forever
nonsectarian and universal in its
appeal."
In his inaugural address (p.
204) Dr. Wilbur said, with refer
ence to Ihe Church, that Mrs.
Stanford "made it free from man
made creeds and varieties of re
ligion. . . . Let each man choose
his own method of worship, but
we can here give our students the
chance to hear the words of those
who seek to interpret the relig
ious thought and teachings of the
day or to guide us in the ethical
aspects of human conduct."
THE VIEW of religion and of
the Memorial Church in Stanford
life adopted from the outset by
the Stanfords and, 1 believe, car
ried on by all five of Stanford's
presidents is clearly a great deal
broader and more tolerant than
that of your March 6 editorial.
Stanford has grown with the
years and now has students not
only from all over Europe and
the Americas but also from Asia,
Africa, and Australia and Ihose
students represent many different
creeds. Yet, so broadly inclusive
and universal was the initial con
ception of this place of worship
that no change in policy has been
necessary and the Memorial
Church still welcomes all who
wish to worship there, regardless
of the name they give their God.
At the same time the Church re
mains "a family shrine and par
ticularly a memorial" to Senator
Stanford given to the University
by his wife. That is why, to quole
your editorial title again. "Me
morial Church Remembers Le
land," namely because it was a
memorial to the Senator, and it is
therefore entirely appropriate
that Founders' Day should be cele
brated there and that an address
about the Founders and what they
founded should be delivered there.
YOUR EDITORIAL contains
several inaccuracies and also
some statements which are ques
tionable in taste if in nothing else.
First, would it have been too
stuffy to have said "Senator Stan
ford" rather than "Leland" in
your title? The statement "If the
thought that this University was
founded stirs your heart, you
must wait until next year to do

anything about it," was doubtless
meant to be amusing. Perhaps it
is, but if so, it is only in a sopho
more way. To sneer that Dr. Bar
clay "seemed to bp an especially
qualified speaker since he is iho
great-grandson of a personal
friend of Leland Stanford" misses
the point as offensively as the
rest of the editorial, ft seems
more sensible 1o assume that
President Sterling asked Dr. Bar
clay to deliver the Founders' Day
address because he has bPen asso
ciated with the University for
over 30 years and is one of the
best-known and best-loved of
Stanford's professors. Universi-!
ties such as Stanford owe a great
deal to the unremitting service
and loyalty of devoted faculty
members of Professor Barclay's
stamp, but these are qualities
which the editor may not esteem
as highly as Dr. Sterling appar
ently does. Dr. Wilbur (Memoirs,
p. 20.")). perhaps naively, held that
one of the great features of the
kind of University Stanford as
pired to become "must be loyal
ty." The same could be of course
be said of most of Ihe more im
portant aspects of human life, in
the family, in the professions, in
public service, in politics, and in
government. To go on with the
errors, the first president of Stan
ford was "David," not "William" |

Starr Jordan. I am 6iire Dr. Bar
clay flirt not spell the word "sen
tamentalize," the form in which it
appears in the editorial, but per
haps this a typographical error.
It is true that Dr. Barclay did not
mention God in his address, but if
I heard aright, He was mentioned
frequently during the religious
part of the service.
IN YOUR editorial of March 10
you adopt a different line and at
titude. There is a moi-e serious
approach and there is also what
I take to be an attempt to gloss
over the factual mistakes of the
March (5 editorial concerning the
background of the Memorial
Church. There is the beginning
of a constructive idea, viz, the
possibility that a different kind of
Founders' Day program, might b<*
worked out, but it would have
been better to renounce more
openly the flagrant errors of the
earlier editorial. Your statement
that "The University should not
take advantage of a capacity Sun
day church audience to com
memorate the founders with an
address which, while perceptively
conceived and well delivered, was
out of place" is off the track. Ap
parently il did not occurr to you
that the "capacity Sunday church
audience" was well aware of the
nature of the function or that
many attended specifically be-

I cause it was the Founders' Day
â–  service. Moreover, some might al
ready have worshipped in the way
land at the times prescribed by
their own religions. As for the
remarks about the "perceptively
j conceived and well delivered" ad-
Id ress and the admonition to the
!"able" Committee on Public Ex
ercises lo work hard at their next
meeting, my only comment is
that it is wiser and more becom
ing for young people to avoid
i trying lo be either patronizing or
sarcastic.
I regret that my comments
have had to be so adversely criti
cal but we live in a community of
scholars and must describe things
as we see them. In any case it
seems not inappropriate to point
out that your opinions of Ihe
Church and the Founders' Day
program is not the only one cur
rent on ihe campus. If there are
I many students at Stanford who
! find the present method of honor
ling ihe Founders unsatisfactory,
there certainly is no reason why
they should not propose changes
but there seems to be no reason
why this could not be done with
out flippancy, inaccuracy, and dis
respect for those who made this
University and its great achieve
ments possible.

ception of this place of worship
that no change in policy has been
necessary and the Memorial
Church still welcomes all who
wish to worship there, regardless
of the name they give their God.
At the same time the Church re
mains "a family shrine and par
ticularly a memorial" to Senator
Stanford given to the University
by his wife. That is why, to quole
your editorial title again. "Me
morial Church Remembers Le
land," namely because it was a
memorial to the Senator, and it is
therefore entirely appropriate
that Founders' Day should be cele
brated there and that an address
about the Founders and what they
founded should be delivered there.
YOUR EDITORIAL contains
several inaccuracies and also
some statements which are ques
tionable in taste if in nothing else.
First, would it have been too
stuffy to have said "Senator Stan
ford" rather than "Leland" in
your title? The statement "If the
thought that this University was
founded stirs your heart, you
must wait until next year to do

anything about it," was doubtless
meant to be amusing. Perhaps it
is, but if so, it is only in a sopho
more way. To sneer that Dr. Bar
clay "seemed to bp an especially
qualified speaker since he is iho
great-grandson of a personal
friend of Leland Stanford" misses
the point as offensively as the
rest of the editorial, ft seems
more sensible 1o assume that
President Sterling asked Dr. Bar
clay to deliver the Founders' Day
address because he has bPen asso
ciated with the University for
over 30 years and is one of the
best-known and best-loved of
Stanford's professors. Universi-!
ties such as Stanford owe a great
deal to the unremitting service
and loyalty of devoted faculty
members of Professor Barclay's
stamp, but these are qualities
which the editor may not esteem
as highly as Dr. Sterling appar
ently does. Dr. Wilbur (Memoirs,
p. 20.")). perhaps naively, held that
one of the great features of the
kind of University Stanford as
pired to become "must be loyal
ty." The same could be of course
be said of most of Ihe more im
portant aspects of human life, in
the family, in the professions, in
public service, in politics, and in
government. To go on with the
errors, the first president of Stan
ford was "David," not "William" |

Starr Jordan. I am 6iire Dr. Bar
clay flirt not spell the word "sen
tamentalize," the form in which it
appears in the editorial, but per
haps this a typographical error.
It is true that Dr. Barclay did not
mention God in his address, but if
I heard aright, He was mentioned
frequently during the religious
part of the service.
IN YOUR editorial of March 10
you adopt a different line and at
titude. There is a moi-e serious
approach and there is also what
I take to be an attempt to gloss
over the factual mistakes of the
March (5 editorial concerning the
background of the Memorial
Church. There is the beginning
of a constructive idea, viz, the
possibility that a different kind of
Founders' Day program, might b<*
worked out, but it would have
been better to renounce more
openly the flagrant errors of the
earlier editorial. Your statement
that "The University should not
take advantage of a capacity Sun
day church audience to com
memorate the founders with an
address which, while perceptively
conceived and well delivered, was
out of place" is off the track. Ap
parently il did not occurr to you
that the "capacity Sunday church
audience" was well aware of the
nature of the function or that
many attended specifically be-

I cause it was the Founders' Day
â–  service. Moreover, some might al
ready have worshipped in the way
land at the times prescribed by
their own religions. As for the
remarks about the "perceptively
j conceived and well delivered" ad-
Id ress and the admonition to the
!"able" Committee on Public Ex
ercises lo work hard at their next
meeting, my only comment is
that it is wiser and more becom
ing for young people to avoid
i trying lo be either patronizing or
sarcastic.
I regret that my comments
have had to be so adversely criti
cal but we live in a community of
scholars and must describe things
as we see them. In any case it
seems not inappropriate to point
out that your opinions of Ihe
Church and the Founders' Day
program is not the only one cur
rent on ihe campus. If there are
I many students at Stanford who
! find the present method of honor
ling ihe Founders unsatisfactory,
there certainly is no reason why
they should not propose changes
but there seems to be no reason
why this could not be done with
out flippancy, inaccuracy, and dis
respect for those who made this
University and its great achieve
ments possible.

this special instance, has lilted its
250-word maximum on letters to
the editor.)
Since The Daily is a student
paper, most of ils editorial opin
ions are written by and for Stan
ford students and properly should
he commented on by students
alone. Occasionally, however, mat
ters of deep concern to the
broader Stanford community, in
cluding alumni, faculty, and
friends of the University, are
treated and when this happens, as
in the editorials of March 6 and
10, 1961 on the Memorial Church
and Founders' Day, response from
a wider audience may be expected.
I am a Stanford alumnus who
graduated 30 years ago this June
before going on to advanced study
here and elsewhere. I have also
been a member of the Stanford
faculty for a total of 18 years. For
what it may be worth I should
like to take issues with the views
and the tone of the editorials
mentioned, especially that of
March (5.
THE WRITER of the editorial
of March 6, which was given the
title "Memorial Church Remem
bers Leland," presumably in an
embarrassingly dismal attempt to i
be clever, shows little knowledge
of the background of the Me
morial Church, or of Stanford
University for that matter, and
even less appreciation of the senti
ments behind Ihe Stanford en
dowment. It does not seem unrea
sonable to expect the editor of the i
Stanford Daily to get the facts i
straight and interpret them clear- j
ly, for there are many readily '
available sources of information. :
One of the easiest to obtain and
the most recent is a volume pub- ;
lished by the Stanford University ;
Press last year, "The Memoirs of |
Ray Lyman Wilbur, 1975-1945," :
under the editorship of Edgar Eu- j
gene Robinson and Paul Carroll i
Edwards, the former an active<
member of the faculty from 1911
to 1952 and the latter an alumnus j
and a longtime member and an
ex-president of the Stanford j
Board of Trustees. Dr. Wilbur, j
who entered Stanford with the |
second class and graduated in
1896, was the third president of
the University, serving from 1916
to 1943, except for four years as '
Secretary of the Interior in the |
Hoover Administration, 1929-1933.
He was exceptionally well quali
fied to speak, because he was here
almost from the beginning and
was well acquainted with Senator
and Mrs. Stanford, as ho was also
with his two predecessors and his
two successors in the presidency.
IN THE memoirs, p. 93, Dr. Wil
bur explains, "To Mrs. Stanford
the Church was more than a sa
cred place; it was her family
shrine and particularly a me
morial to her husband. In fact, the
pillars of the Church are inscribed
with names of members of ihc
family. It was the key building
of the University both in its posi
tion in the Inner Quadrangle and
in her own thoughts. She was'

deeply religious and was sus
tained throughout her sorrow and
bereavement by'her great faith.
She and her husband were broad
ly tolerant of all religions and de
nominations, and they wanted the
Memorial Church to be forever
nonsectarian and universal in its
appeal."
In his inaugural address (p.
204) Dr. Wilbur said, with refer
ence to Ihe Church, that Mrs.
Stanford "made it free from man
made creeds and varieties of re
ligion. . . . Let each man choose
his own method of worship, but
we can here give our students the
chance to hear the words of those
who seek to interpret the relig
ious thought and teachings of the
day or to guide us in the ethical
aspects of human conduct."
THE VIEW of religion and of
the Memorial Church in Stanford
life adopted from the outset by
the Stanfords and, 1 believe, car
ried on by all five of Stanford's
presidents is clearly a great deal
broader and more tolerant than
that of your March 6 editorial.
Stanford has grown with the
years and now has students not
only from all over Europe and
the Americas but also from Asia,
Africa, and Australia and Ihose
students represent many different
creeds. Yet, so broadly inclusive
and universal was the initial con
ception of this place of worship
that no change in policy has been
necessary and the Memorial
Church still welcomes all who
wish to worship there, regardless
of the name they give their God.
At the same time the Church re
mains "a family shrine and par
ticularly a memorial" to Senator
