### 
SAN JOSE —Stanford baseballers, behind fine clutch pitching by
Marv Mecklenberg, defeated San Jose State 7-3 last night for their
twelfth victory against five defeats for the season.
Hal Schutzmann and Mecklenberg led Stanford's hitting attack
as both went three for five for the evening. The Card veteran Meck-

lenberg knocked in throe of the
Indians seven runs.
The Tribe scored twice in the
second on two walks and a triple
against the left field wall by
sophomore Joel Shulman. They
scored again in the sixth after two
were out, San Jose State pitchers
Wilson and Maytorena were
ticketed for two walks, a single
by Mecklenberg and one by Shutz
mann brought two more across
for the Tribe.
Alter San Jose scored one run
in their half of the sixth inning,
Stanford came right back in the
eighth inning after Lee Moench
walked, Shulman sacrificed him
to second base. Mecklenberg got
a bunt single and then Moench

| scored on an error by Spartan
|catcher Ken Williams.
Then the next two State pitch
ers Guthrie and Turnbull walked
Shutzmann, Skip Lawrence and
Greg Post to score Mecklenberg
and the sixth Tribe run.
Stanford scored their last run
in the ninth and the Spartans
came back with two quick runs
as apparently Card hurlor Meck
lenberg was tiring in the last
inning.
