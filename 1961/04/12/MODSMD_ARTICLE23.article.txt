The Pittsburgh Pirates, steal
ing a page from their 1960 vic
tory book, opened defense of their
world championship Tuesday by
nipping the San Francisco Giants,
8-7, on the strength of Bill Vir
don's three-run ninth inning
homer.
PINCH-HITTER Dick Schofield
doubled with two out in ihe ninth
inning and Giant reliever Stu Mil
ler purposely passed Dick Stuart.
Mike McCormick was summoned
from the bullpen to pitch to Vir
don, but the strategy backfired
when the Pittsburgh centerfielder
rifled McCormick's first pitch
over the right field screen.
An opening day crowd of 41,423
at Candlestick Park in San Fran
cisco saw the Giants build up a
6-3 lead in five innings behind
homers by Willie McCovey and

Orlando Cepeda but the Pirates,
who nailed down tho N.L. flag
and the World Series last year
with lale inning rallies, finally got
rifl of Giant starter Sam Jones in
tho sixth inning by loading the
bases on three singles.
MII.LKR came on and the Pi
rates closed the gap against the
little reliever to 7-5, setting the
stajjo for Virdon's ninth inning
heroics.
In other league action, the St.
Louis Cardinals backed up excel
lent relief pitching by ace fire
man Lindy McDaniel to beat the
Milwaukee Braves. 2-1. in 10 in
nings and the Cincinnati Reds
routed the Chicago Cubs, 7-1. in
other afternoon National League
opening games. The Philadelphia
Phillies met the Dodgers in Los
Angeles in a night opener.
Till: CARDINALS, with the
worst opening day record in the
N.L., got off on tho right foot
when shortstop Daryl Spencer
lined a homer off 39-year-old War
ren Spahn in the 10th inning. A
crowd of 33,327 saw the opener
at Milwaukee.
Spahn held a 1-0 lead to the
eighth when catcher Hal Smith
tripled and scored on a single by
pinch-hitter Bob Nieman. Then
McDaniel took over for the Cards
and held the Braves hit less 'for
the last three innings. Eddie
Mathews' fourth-inning homer
was ihe only run given up by St.
Louis starter Ernie Broglio.
