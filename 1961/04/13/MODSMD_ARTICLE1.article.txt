# CONTROVERSY EVERYWHERE
## A 						Close Inspection of the John Birch Society 
### JUDY SEABORG 
The much-attacked John Birch Society,
which has seemingly sprung out of the
ground in recent weeks, stirring up contro
versy all over the nation, is actually the re
sult of two years, of development into its
present state as a radical right-wing organ
ization dedicated to fighting Communism.
Its founder and leader is Robert W.
Welch, a G1 -year-old native of North Carolina
who retired from a candy-making firm four
years ago to devote his energy and money to
his cause. Local chapters, called cells, in
Berkeley and San Francisco, comprise the
Western branch of the Society, whose home
chapter is in Belmont, Mass.
WELCH'S contentions and the essence of
the Society's causes are briefly:
That the world-wide Communist con
spiracy has so infiltrated the United States
that it is running the Pentagon, subtly influ
encing our defense program, international
policies, and our taxes.
The outcome. Welch says, will be inereas

ingly greater deficits, wild inflation, and
eventually government "socialistic controls
over every operation of our economy and
every activity of our daily lives."
THIS WILL be followed by a softening
up of the American will and eventual sur
render on Communist terms.
These views and the Society's proposed
actions are contained in the 180-page "Blue
Book of the John Birch Society," which is a
transcript of remarks by Welch on the oc
casion of the Society's founding.
"The increasing quantity of government
in all nations has constituted the greatest
tragedy of the 20th century," he says, claim
ing that a republican form of government
at this time "lends itself too readily to infil
tration, distortion and disruption" and that
"democracy is merely a deceptive phrase, a
weapon of demagoguery, and a perennial
fraud."
FOR THESE reasons, "The John Birch So
ciety will operate under completely authori
tarian control at all levels." The group has

a Communist-like organization: chapters
with a chapter.leader and from 12 to 20 mem
bers. It is not however, it says, a secret so
ciety, and members are free to reveal their
names if they like and to take anyone to their
meetings. Small membership units and a
monolithic, authoritarian structure may be
Communist devices, but they are effective
also in keeping Communists out of the So
ciety, Welch reasons.
Members, claim the Society, don't have to
share any views, even Welch's, beyond the
necessity of opposing Communism.
Members are given a 10-point program of
action including exposing alleged Commu
nists, tripping them up by questions at pub
lic meetings, writing letters to legislators,
and organizing front groups of all kinds, in
cluding those suggested by Welch: "The
Committee of One Million," devoted specific
ally to keeping Red China out of the U.N.,
"A Committee to Investigate Communist In
fluences at Vassar College," and "Women
Against Labor Union Hoodlumism."
Other techniques suggested by Welch in

elude mass letter writing and speeches on
subjects other than Communism which
would still carry a strong anti-Communist
message.
WELCH HAS caused much criticism by his
radical attacks upon such men as former
President Dwight D. Eisenhower who was
put in the presidency, Welch claims, by the
international Communist conspiracy to call
the plays for the Kremlin. Main targets also
include Chief Justice Earl Warren and the
National Council of Churches.
The Society derives its name from John
Birch, a fundamentalist Baptist missionary
who was a war-time military intelligence
captain with Claire Chennault. He was killed
by the Chinese 10 days after V-J Day.
Birch's parents still live on a Georgia
farm and say they are proud the society is
named after their son, who received two dec
orations for his intelligence work; the Legion
of Merit in 1944 and an Oak Leaf Cluster to
the Legion of Merit, awarded posthumously
in 1946.
THE SOCIETY has been accused on one

hand, by men such as Sen. Stephen M.
Young, of "practicing character assassina
tion without regard for the truth," threaten
ing educators and merchants, and of spread
ing "fear, hatred and suspicion."
Defenders claim that the society's activi
ties have consisted so far only of recom
mending conservative books, and writing let
ters in support of various projects.
Assemblyman Gordon H. Winton has sug
gested that the group could be Communist
used, or may result in something worse than
Communism, just as the Hitler organization
did.
ATTY-GKN. STANLEY Mosk, contending
that subversion from the radical right is as
dangerous as from the radical left, has listed
a group of tests for determining extremism,
including whether the organization attacks
churches and schools with blanket accusa
tions, labels everyone un-American with
whom it disagrees politically, attacks other
traditional American institutions with unsup
ported charges, and is more interested in
money than in its principles.

cluding those suggested by Welch: "The
Committee of One Million," devoted specific
ally to keeping Red China out of the U.N.,
"A Committee to Investigate Communist In
fluences at Vassar College," and "Women
Against Labor Union Hoodlumism."
Other techniques suggested by Welch in

elude mass letter writing and speeches on
subjects other than Communism which
would still carry a strong anti-Communist
message.
WELCH HAS caused much criticism by his
radical attacks upon such men as former
President Dwight D. Eisenhower who was
put in the presidency, Welch claims, by the
international Communist conspiracy to call
the plays for the Kremlin. Main targets also
include Chief Justice Earl Warren and the
National Council of Churches.
The Society derives its name from John
Birch, a fundamentalist Baptist missionary
who was a war-time military intelligence
captain with Claire Chennault. He was killed
by the Chinese 10 days after V-J Day.
Birch's parents still live on a Georgia
farm and say they are proud the society is
named after their son, who received two dec
orations for his intelligence work; the Legion
of Merit in 1944 and an Oak Leaf Cluster to
the Legion of Merit, awarded posthumously
in 1946.
THE SOCIETY has been accused on one

hand, by men such as Sen. Stephen M.
Young, of "practicing character assassina
tion without regard for the truth," threaten
ing educators and merchants, and of spread
ing "fear, hatred and suspicion."
Defenders claim that the society's activi
ties have consisted so far only of recom
mending conservative books, and writing let
ters in support of various projects.
Assemblyman Gordon H. Winton has sug
gested that the group could be Communist
used, or may result in something worse than
Communism, just as the Hitler organization
did.
ATTY-GKN. STANLEY Mosk, contending
that subversion from the radical right is as
dangerous as from the radical left, has listed
a group of tests for determining extremism,
including whether the organization attacks
churches and schools with blanket accusa
tions, labels everyone un-American with
whom it disagrees politically, attacks other
traditional American institutions with unsup
ported charges, and is more interested in
money than in its principles.
The much-attacked John Birch Society,
which has seemingly sprung out of the
ground in recent weeks, stirring up contro
versy all over the nation, is actually the re
sult of two years, of development into its
present state as a radical right-wing organ
ization dedicated to fighting Communism.
Its founder and leader is Robert W.
Welch, a G1 -year-old native of North Carolina
who retired from a candy-making firm four
years ago to devote his energy and money to
his cause. Local chapters, called cells, in
Berkeley and San Francisco, comprise the
Western branch of the Society, whose home
chapter is in Belmont, Mass.
WELCH'S contentions and the essence of
the Society's causes are briefly:
That the world-wide Communist con
spiracy has so infiltrated the United States
that it is running the Pentagon, subtly influ
encing our defense program, international
policies, and our taxes.
The outcome. Welch says, will be inereas

ingly greater deficits, wild inflation, and
eventually government "socialistic controls
over every operation of our economy and
every activity of our daily lives."
THIS WILL be followed by a softening
up of the American will and eventual sur
render on Communist terms.
These views and the Society's proposed
actions are contained in the 180-page "Blue
Book of the John Birch Society," which is a
transcript of remarks by Welch on the oc
casion of the Society's founding.
"The increasing quantity of government
in all nations has constituted the greatest
tragedy of the 20th century," he says, claim
ing that a republican form of government
at this time "lends itself too readily to infil
tration, distortion and disruption" and that
"democracy is merely a deceptive phrase, a
weapon of demagoguery, and a perennial
fraud."
FOR THESE reasons, "The John Birch So
ciety will operate under completely authori
tarian control at all levels." The group has

a Communist-like organization: chapters
with a chapter.leader and from 12 to 20 mem
bers. It is not however, it says, a secret so
ciety, and members are free to reveal their
names if they like and to take anyone to their
meetings. Small membership units and a
monolithic, authoritarian structure may be
Communist devices, but they are effective
also in keeping Communists out of the So
ciety, Welch reasons.
Members, claim the Society, don't have to
share any views, even Welch's, beyond the
necessity of opposing Communism.
Members are given a 10-point program of
action including exposing alleged Commu
nists, tripping them up by questions at pub
lic meetings, writing letters to legislators,
and organizing front groups of all kinds, in
cluding those suggested by Welch: "The
Committee of One Million," devoted specific

Berkeley and San Francisco, comprise the
Western branch of the Society, whose home
chapter is in Belmont, Mass.
WELCH'S contentions and the essence of
the Society's causes are briefly:
That the world-wide Communist con
spiracy has so infiltrated the United States
that it is running the Pentagon, subtly influ
encing our defense program, international
policies, and our taxes.
The outcome. Welch says, will be inereas

ingly greater deficits, wild inflation, and
eventually government "socialistic controls
over every operation of our economy and
every activity of our daily lives."
THIS WILL be followed by a softening
up of the American will and eventual sur
render on Communist terms.
These views and the Society's proposed
actions are contained in the 180-page "Blue
Book of the John Birch Society," which is a
transcript of remarks by Welch on the oc
casion of the Society's founding.
"The increasing quantity of government
in all nations has constituted the greatest
tragedy of the 20th century," he says, claim
ing that a republican form of government
at this time "lends itself too readily to infil
tration, distortion and disruption" and that
"democracy is merely a deceptive phrase, a
weapon of demagoguery, and a perennial
fraud."
FOR THESE reasons, "The John Birch So
ciety will operate under completely authori
tarian control at all levels." The group has

a Communist-like organization: chapters
with a chapter.leader and from 12 to 20 mem
bers. It is not however, it says, a secret so
ciety, and members are free to reveal their
names if they like and to take anyone to their
meetings. Small membership units and a
monolithic, authoritarian structure may be
Communist devices, but they are effective
also in keeping Communists out of the So
ciety, Welch reasons.
Members, claim the Society, don't have to
share any views, even Welch's, beyond the
necessity of opposing Communism.
Members are given a 10-point program of
action including exposing alleged Commu
nists, tripping them up by questions at pub
lic meetings, writing letters to legislators,
and organizing front groups of all kinds, in
cluding those suggested by Welch: "The
Committee of One Million," devoted specific
ally to keeping Red China out of the U.N.,
"A Committee to Investigate Communist In
fluences at Vassar College," and "Women
Against Labor Union Hoodlumism."
Other techniques suggested by Welch in

elude mass letter writing and speeches on
subjects other than Communism which
would still carry a strong anti-Communist
message.
WELCH HAS caused much criticism by his
radical attacks upon such men as former
President Dwight D. Eisenhower who was
put in the presidency, Welch claims, by the
international Communist conspiracy to call
the plays for the Kremlin. Main targets also
include Chief Justice Earl Warren and the
National Council of Churches.
The Society derives its name from John
Birch, a fundamentalist Baptist missionary
who was a war-time military intelligence
captain with Claire Chennault. He was killed
by the Chinese 10 days after V-J Day.
Birch's parents still live on a Georgia
farm and say they are proud the society is
named after their son, who received two dec
orations for his intelligence work; the Legion
of Merit in 1944 and an Oak Leaf Cluster to
the Legion of Merit, awarded posthumously
in 1946.
THE SOCIETY has been accused on one

hand, by men such as Sen. Stephen M.
Young, of "practicing character assassina
tion without regard for the truth," threaten
ing educators and merchants, and of spread
ing "fear, hatred and suspicion."
Defenders claim that the society's activi
ties have consisted so far only of recom
mending conservative books, and writing let
ters in support of various projects.
Assemblyman Gordon H. Winton has sug
gested that the group could be Communist
used, or may result in something worse than
Communism, just as the Hitler organization
did.
ATTY-GKN. STANLEY Mosk, contending
that subversion from the radical right is as
dangerous as from the radical left, has listed
a group of tests for determining extremism,
including whether the organization attacks
churches and schools with blanket accusa
tions, labels everyone un-American with
whom it disagrees politically, attacks other
traditional American institutions with unsup
ported charges, and is more interested in
money than in its principles.
The much-attacked John Birch Society,
which has seemingly sprung out of the
ground in recent weeks, stirring up contro
versy all over the nation, is actually the re
sult of two years, of development into its
present state as a radical right-wing organ
ization dedicated to fighting Communism.
Its founder and leader is Robert W.
Welch, a G1 -year-old native of North Carolina
who retired from a candy-making firm four
years ago to devote his energy and money to
his cause. Local chapters, called cells, in
Berkeley and San Francisco, comprise the
Western branch of the Society, whose home
chapter is in Belmont, Mass.
