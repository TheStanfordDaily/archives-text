# U.S. Congo Policy Needs Examination
## 
### 
While last week's arrival of Irish troops under United Nations
command has brought a period of uneasy peace to the Congo, the
United Nations operation there still wallows in much the same state
of hopelessness as when it began to operate many months ago.
It is true that the United Nations takeover has saved the Congo
from an even bloodier blood bath than did occur. However, the
U.N.'s handling of the Congo situation has not always been such
to inspire confidence. Instead of being truly international troops,
the U.N. forces have tended to become the pawns of the Congo
chess game. Those nations who supposedly place most faith in
a world government, namely those of Africa and Asia, have been
most guilty of this practice. The United Arab Republic, when it
pulled out its troops, almost made possible the downfall of the
entire U.N. position. Mr. Dayal, the Indian commander of the U.N.
forces, has failed to use the Indian troops in decisive fashion which
would separate the Congo factions.
What is needed is a native leader who will unite these factions.
This man appears to be Mr. Tshombe of the Katanga Province who
has gained the respect of the people despite his tag of "Belgian
backed." Until his charges against the U.N. forces on last Tuesday,
he has shown the most promise of leadership. At the Malagsy
conference it was he who put forth plans for a confederation of
the Congo state, the only native leader to do so.
As a native leader who has the support of the Congolese popu
lace Mr. Tshombe seems to be the man who perhaps can bring
order out of a temporarily glossed-over chaos. If this be counter
to the U.N.'s and Washington's current Congo policy, perhaps it
is time for a re-evaluation of that policy. A man who seems ready
to work with the West certainly deserves the support of the West
in a region where democracy, at least for the moment, must be
postponed.
