## Peace Corps Would Help Unfortunate 
### 
wish to help the underdeveloped
peoples solely because it will help
to defeat Communism, then our
philosophy has become negative.
We no longer help the unfortu
nate because they are unfor
tunate, but because they are
pawns which we move around a
board trying to gain "strategic"
position. But life is not a game
of chess and people are not pieces
of plastic.
These people need assistance
from someone who can afford
to give it to them and America
can. The assistance will not be
forced down their throats. Only
those countries requesting aid
will receive it. Few countries, so
far, have requested such assist
ance. The "right" points to this
fart gleefully and says this proves
"altruism" has no place in our
wonderful modern era. But the
right fails to realize that coun
tries are still skeptical of a "no
strings attached" offer from the
U.S. exactly because we have peo
ple in this country who talk only
in terms of "strategy."
THE PRINCIPLES of the
Peace Corps are identical with
the principles on which this coun
try was founded. It is high time
we started to practice as well as
preach these principles. Our na
tion is firmly committed to the be
lief that there is plenty for all, Ihat
no people should starve or be ig
norant, that the fortunate should
give to the unfortunate.
If this is purely "altruistic," it
is also purely humane and just.
Perhaps assistance to the needy
with "no strings attached" is an
example of "fuzzy-headed think
ing," but it is the concept upon
which America is founded and the
concept to which America should
always be committed.

A basic tenet of our law is that
a person is innocent until proved
guilty. Similarly, a scientist does
not know a priori that an experi
ment on which he is laboring will
fail to produce the desired re
sults.
Social or political experiments,
as well as scientific ones cannot
be judged as to their effectiveness
until they have been subjected to
practical tests. Therefore, no one
has the foresight to assume, as
have some persons, that the Peace
Corps, which is not yet in action,
has failed to meet its potential.
MAYBE TIIK Peace Corps will
fail. Maybe we shouldn't be "al
truistic." Maybe we should alter
our ideals so that everything is
geared to fight Communism to
the ideological death. On the
other hand, maybe we do not
have to surrender our ideals for
"strategy."

phrey introduced the Peace Corps
Bill to Congress on June 15, 1960,
he said: "I wish to make it very
clear that the bill I am introduc

and Engels had never lived,
there still would be just as much
need for action to develop the po

wish to help the underdeveloped
peoples solely because it will help
to defeat Communism, then our
philosophy has become negative.
We no longer help the unfortu
nate because they are unfor
tunate, but because they are
pawns which we move around a
board trying to gain "strategic"
position. But life is not a game
of chess and people are not pieces
of plastic.
These people need assistance
from someone who can afford
to give it to them and America
can. The assistance will not be
forced down their throats. Only
those countries requesting aid
will receive it. Few countries, so
far, have requested such assist
ance. The "right" points to this
fart gleefully and says this proves
"altruism" has no place in our
wonderful modern era. But the
right fails to realize that coun
tries are still skeptical of a "no
strings attached" offer from the
U.S. exactly because we have peo
ple in this country who talk only
in terms of "strategy."
THE PRINCIPLES of the
Peace Corps are identical with
the principles on which this coun
try was founded. It is high time
we started to practice as well as
preach these principles. Our na
tion is firmly committed to the be
lief that there is plenty for all, Ihat
no people should starve or be ig
norant, that the fortunate should
give to the unfortunate.
If this is purely "altruistic," it
is also purely humane and just.
Perhaps assistance to the needy
with "no strings attached" is an
example of "fuzzy-headed think
ing," but it is the concept upon
which America is founded and the
concept to which America should
always be committed.

A basic tenet of our law is that
a person is innocent until proved
guilty. Similarly, a scientist does
not know a priori that an experi
ment on which he is laboring will
fail to produce the desired re
sults.
Social or political experiments,
as well as scientific ones cannot
be judged as to their effectiveness
until they have been subjected to
practical tests. Therefore, no one
has the foresight to assume, as
have some persons, that the Peace
Corps, which is not yet in action,
has failed to meet its potential.
MAYBE TIIK Peace Corps will
fail. Maybe we shouldn't be "al
truistic." Maybe we should alter
our ideals so that everything is
geared to fight Communism to
the ideological death. On the
other hand, maybe we do not
have to surrender our ideals for
"strategy."
When Senator Hubert Hum
phrey introduced the Peace Corps
Bill to Congress on June 15, 1960,
he said: "I wish to make it very
clear that the bill I am introduc
ing is not meant primarily as an
anti-Communist measure. If Marx
and Engels had never lived,
there still would be just as much
need for action to develop the po
tential of the underdeveloped na
tions.
"We in the West must not only
think about negative policies to
stop Communism—but also about
creative efforts which reflect our
own elevating visions of the kind
of world in which we would like to
see mankind live."
TIIE THEORY expostulated by
the "right" that "strategy" and
only strategy should govern our
foreign policy endangers the very
heart of America's ideals. If we
