the first time units will be able
to recruit and train language per
sonnel according to their require
ments.
Recruitment will be limited to
seniors in college or to those who

have received a bachelor's degree
before enlistment. Successful ap
plicants will be enlisted in the Re
serve Forces Act of 1955 program,

individual MOS training, and then
assigned as students to the Army
