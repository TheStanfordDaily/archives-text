Football and Basketball—Out of Season
Stanley Woodward in a column in the Now York Herald Tribune
look a slap at R. Kenneth Fairman, Republican politician who acts as
graduate football manager at Princeton, when the latter destroyed
tlie Tigers' hopo that a series of football games could he arranged
with Stanford.
Dick Colman, Democratic politician who coaches the football team,
pointed out simultaneously that the proposed series "would not ap
pear to be a natural rivalry."
THK ARTICLE goes on to say that Princeton and all of the Ivy
League for that matter is in trouble. The Ivy League Code forbids
its athletes to participate in charity all-star games. There is also a
no-spring-practice clause.
In conclusion Woodward states "Fortunately there are people in
Ihe Ivy League who are not frightened. Bob Kane, at Cornell, has
booked a series with Navy. Delaney Kiphuth, at Yale, is reported to
be negotiating with Michigan.
"Only strong outside games can save the Ivy League."
It just might he that some games between Stanford and the Ivy
League would be advantageous to both parties concerned.
One cannot but marvel at the genius of Frank McGuire, famed
basketball coach at the University of North Carolina. The man has
turned out many championship teams in the last decade and is almost
a god in Chapel Hill. Recognized as one of the top men in his profes
sion, McGuire is not afraid to risk his ranking by resting on his
laurels. Take this for an example:
The scene was Kansas City, Mo., on the eve of the finals of the
NCAA basketball tournament. Cincinnati, an upstart which had lost
its great All-American Oscar Robertson, was meeting undefeated
Ohio State, defending national champs. State was an overwhelming
favorite.
"NOTHING CAN STOI* State now." Bach, the Fordham coach
said. "They're like the Panzer outfits running across France. They're
going to the beach—all the way to the beach."
Litwack, the Temple coach, said, "Wonderful personnel, terrific
speed, great shooting and by far the greatest center (Jerry Lucas)
in the game today."
McDermott. the lona coach who always had a keen wit about
his team, said. "I can't even joke about State. After the first few
minutes last night, I just sat there drooling with all the rest."
"CINCINNATI WILL GET up very high for this one," said .Too
Lapchich of St. John's, "but it won't do them any good."
Baron Adolph Rupp of Kentucky predicted a disastrous end for
Cincinnati. "They will try to run with them," he said, "and they will
be destroyed."
Why then did McGuire speak out? Even if he felt Cincy could
win, the chances were that he would be wrong. "They're not going to
panic," McGuire said. "They won't be killed off the boards like St.
Joe's was and I think they'll come up with something to slow down
State's attack."
Not a had prediction, Mr. McGuire.
