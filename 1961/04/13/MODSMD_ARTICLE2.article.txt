# Segregation Vital To South's Growth, Barnett Asserts
## 
### LOIS ROOT 
"During the reconstruction period, the South was under the con
trol of military governors. One wonders why the United States gov
ernment did not undertake integration at this time," remarked James
Barnett, Mississippi lawyer, in his opening comments in Cubberley

Auditorium last night.
Barnett's frame of reference
centered on a distinction between
discrimination ("a sin, common to
all people in the country"), and
segregation, "our state's way of
growing out of its basic economic
difficulties/'
In defending segregation, Bar
net t disclosed that segregation
doesn't exist in the economic field;
business in the South are peopled
and patronized by members of
both races. '"In fact, as a lawyer,
I work for Negroes." Inability to
buy is a factor common to both
races, he felt.
Burnett spoke on the Supreme
Court decision of 1954: "Up until
this time, most interpretations of
the law were for separate and
equal facilities; the 1954 decision
is a judicial interpretation vary
ing from many past interpreta
tions by many learned men, with
no change in the law for a basis.
We are not transgressing any
law with our stand."
He added, "Integration would
bring violence, which certainly
would be much worse than the
present situation." This view re
peatedly appeared in his answers
to questions from the audience.
When asked if the South would
favor integration if it could be
accomplished without violence, he
admitted "we choose to be segre
gated."
BARNETT did feel that per
haps sometime beyond the for
seeable future, the underlying
conditions in the South might
change, but that Mississippi, like
any other group of human beings,
dislikes being told what to do."
He also felt the distance between
the South as it exists and an in
tegrated South is greater now
than 20 years ago.
He concluded, "It is too bad that
outside people hear only of the
troubles and are not aware of
everyday incidents of good will
between the races in I lie South."

accomplished without violence, he
admitted "we choose to be segre
gated."
BARNETT did feel that per
haps sometime beyond the for
seeable future, the underlying
conditions in the South might
change, but that Mississippi, like
any other group of human beings,
dislikes being told what to do."
He also felt the distance between
the South as it exists and an in
tegrated South is greater now
than 20 years ago.
He concluded, "It is too bad that
outside people hear only of the
troubles and are not aware of
everyday incidents of good will
between the races in I lie South."
