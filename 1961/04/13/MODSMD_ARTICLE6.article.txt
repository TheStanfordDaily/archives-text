# Sponsor Is Central Freshman Evaluates

### LINDA HESS Freshman 
(Editor's Note: This is the last
of three articles concerning fresh
man women sponsors.)

At 8 a.m. on Sept. 21. 1960. the
floodgates were opened, and 423
new Stanford women poured into
the hallowed halls of Branner and
Roble. I was among the neophytes
that day. already forming first
impressions of the Farm and its
people.
My cohorts and I were de
lighted to be greeted at the door
step by a group of helpful Stan
ford men, who chuckled into their
armbands as they toted trunks
and jotted down room numbers.
As soon as we entered the lobby,
we were met by a line of smiles:
smile number one, the dorm di
rector; smile number two. the
house president; number three,
the vice president; and so forth.
We shook hands. We were is
sued pillows. We calmed our
mothers.
SOON we were stumbling up
stairs toward our lodgings. And
as we eagerly perused the ASSU
blotters and the fire regulations,
a new voice greeted us. The girl
who went with the voice appeared
calm, confident, and informed.
She was obviously not a fresh
man. She said she was the spon
sor.
We were welcome at Stanford.
If we needed any help or infor
mation we should please ask.
When we finished unpacking we
should put our bags out in the
hall. As soon as dinner was over
we should come to a corridor
meeting.
A! that moment the sponsor
seemed to be just another cog
in the v.isl machinery that was as
similating us Into Stanford. Little
did we know, as the trauma
known as Pre-Reg Week decended
on us, that she would become
something akin to a mother-god
dess during that first hectic
peiiod.

THE SPONSOR is unquestion
ably Ihe central personality in her
group of approximately 18 girls,
as they go through the process
I of adjustment to college and dorm
i life. In many cases she directly in
fluences the image of Stanford
that takes shape during the first
few weeks.
She serves not only as an aca
j demic adviser, social counselor,
and information bureau, but also
as a symbol, a representative of
the whole University. It is largely
through the sponsor's guidance
that the freshman woman forms
attitudes which may persist
throughout her career at Stan
i ford.
WILL the Fundamental Stand
j ard be an object of respect or ri-
Idicule? Will enthusiasm for aca
demic and extra-curricular activi
ties be generated or stifled? Will
the frosh dollies slart out on the
right foot socially? The sponsor
is a key figure in the answers 1o
these and other important ques
| tions.
As the year progresses the rela
tionship between sponsor and
I freshman changes. When we ar
; rived last fall, she was an official.
ia necessary expedient in our
process of joining the University.
| When -she left at the end of winter
J quarter, she was a friend. She had
; helped, advised, and shared in our
experiences and problems, both
general and personal. We. in turn,
had provided her with an oppor
tunity to increase her understand
: ing of other people, of her school,
| and of herself.
It was a good arrangement all
! the way around.
Naturally not every freshman
woman becomes lifelong buddies
with her sponsor. Nor do all spon
sors give and receive as much as
they could in such an experience.
But most would agree that the
present sponsor system is an en
: riching as well as practical way
to orient and integrate freshman
1 Jiving groups at Stanford.
