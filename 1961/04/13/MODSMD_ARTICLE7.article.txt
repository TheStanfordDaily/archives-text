# Spaceman Returns; Russia Goes Wild
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPI.» — Soviet Air
Force Maj. Yuri Gagarin, a big
grin on his face, said yesterday he
fell fine and suffered no injuries
on the historic orbit around earth
lhat made him the world's first
spaceman.
Russians danced for joy in the
streets at the feat of Soviet rock
etry and the flight of the stocky,
27-year-old cosmonaut in his sil
very space suit. From all over the
world came praise that compared
the son of an almost illiterate car
penter to Columbus, Magellan and
Lindbergh. Automatically, he be
came not only the first man in
space but also the world's fastest
man—traveling at speeds in ex
cess of 25,000 mph.
Stepping from his space cabin
somewhere in the Soviet Union,
Gagarin reported the earth looked
light blue to him during his flight
and the skies around him were
very dark.
"I feel well," he said. '"I have
no injuries or bruises."
Scientists and physicians rushed
him off for intensive examination.
On the basis of their findings
will come the next step. Russian
delegates to a space convention in
Florence, Italy, said the goal now
is to send a man to the moon.
"The battle of space is half
won," said a jubilant Soviet sci
entist.
Premier IVikita S. Khrushchev,
vacationing in Sochi on the Black
Sea, talked to Gagarin by phone
and sent him a cable saying, "I
hug you. See you soon in Mos
cow."
Sources indicated there had been
a Soviet attempt last Friday to
launch a spaceman but that it
failed. There were no other de
tails, although it was reported in
Moscow Monday that a man-in
spaee attempt had been made Fri
day. There was no assessment of
the report from the government.
Tens of thousands of Musco
vites snaked through the streets
cheering Gagarin's name. A pa
rade was planned to rival any
ticket tape parade on Broadway,
New York. There has not been
such excitement in the Soviet cap
ital since V-E day 16 years ago.
In Kiev, Leningrad and else
where. flags flew, people march
ed, bands played. In Kishinev,
Moldavia, city fathers renamed a
street "Gagarin Boulevard."
The government newspaper Iz*
vestia interviewed Gagarin at the
scene of his landing in a "pre
designated spot."

Russians danced for joy in the
streets at the feat of Soviet rock
etry and the flight of the stocky,
27-year-old cosmonaut in his sil
very space suit. From all over the
world came praise that compared
the son of an almost illiterate car
penter to Columbus, Magellan and
Lindbergh. Automatically, he be
came not only the first man in
space but also the world's fastest
man—traveling at speeds in ex
cess of 25,000 mph.
Stepping from his space cabin
somewhere in the Soviet Union,
Gagarin reported the earth looked
light blue to him during his flight
and the skies around him were
very dark.
"I feel well," he said. '"I have
no injuries or bruises."
Scientists and physicians rushed
him off for intensive examination.
On the basis of their findings
will come the next step. Russian
delegates to a space convention in
Florence, Italy, said the goal now
is to send a man to the moon.
"The battle of space is half
won," said a jubilant Soviet sci
entist.
Premier IVikita S. Khrushchev,
vacationing in Sochi on the Black
Sea, talked to Gagarin by phone
and sent him a cable saying, "I
hug you. See you soon in Mos
cow."
Sources indicated there had been
a Soviet attempt last Friday to
launch a spaceman but that it
failed. There were no other de
tails, although it was reported in
Moscow Monday that a man-in
spaee attempt had been made Fri
day. There was no assessment of
the report from the government.
Tens of thousands of Musco
vites snaked through the streets
cheering Gagarin's name. A pa
rade was planned to rival any
ticket tape parade on Broadway,
New York. There has not been
such excitement in the Soviet cap
ital since V-E day 16 years ago.
In Kiev, Leningrad and else
where. flags flew, people march
ed, bands played. In Kishinev,
Moldavia, city fathers renamed a
street "Gagarin Boulevard."
The government newspaper Iz*
vestia interviewed Gagarin at the
scene of his landing in a "pre
designated spot."
MOSCOW (UPI.» — Soviet Air
Force Maj. Yuri Gagarin, a big
grin on his face, said yesterday he
