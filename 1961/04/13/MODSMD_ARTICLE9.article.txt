# Platforms, Criticisms Emerge in ASSU Race
## 
### 
Presidential platforms began to
emerge yesterday as presidential
nominees gave talks to living
groups.
Criticism of the present admin
istration ran high. Jim McGee
stated "student gvernment. is now
ineffective in promting or helping
to direct the increasingly dynamic
University program and the ex
cellent secondary student organ
izatins at Stanfrd."
Boh Sayler, also running for
ASSU president, took a similar
stand, saying "While University
and student affairs were growing,
student government had begun to
die a little before it had fully ma
tured as a result of overburdened
and ineffective leadership."
COMMENTING on McGee's
statement "by reorganizing its
government the Stanford student
body can take the leadership it
deserves on the West Coast."
David Kelley said "McGee's state
ment implies that change in struc
ture is needed. I believe that we
need more effective use of the or
ganization which we already
have."
A number of nominees have
dropped out of the political race
either because they were declared
ineligible or because of other rea
sons.
J. Fleugel Goldstein declined his
presidential nomination yesterday
and Judy Chaskin is ineligible for

the position of AWS president,
leaving no nominees lor this of
fice.
Steve Corker declined his nomi
l nation as Men's Row representa
tive to Legislature, and Frank
Kemerer is no longer running for
Stern's representative.
DROPPING OUT of the compe
tition for Men's Council repre
sentative are John Fischer. Gor
don Barrett, Terry Lewis, Vic
Preisser and Alan Bolton. Two of
those who dropped their nomina
tions for Men's Council belong to
the Zeta Psi fraternity, leaving
only one Zete, Mark Ropers, in
the race.
Referring to the article in yes
terday's Daily, John Garrett,
speaking for the Zetes house
stated, "It was not our intention
to pack Men's Council. Our inten
tion rather has been for the past
two years to gain increased repre
sentation and to do our share in
campus government."
AN APPEAL concerning
Elections Committee Chairman
Elna Rodenhouse's interpretation
of the constitution will be made
to Legislature tonight. Dick Wei
nig, candidate for ICC-Toyon i-ep
resentative to Legislature, will
appeal Miss Rodenhouse's state
ment "Unless Legislature decides
otherwise, all residents of Toyon
and all Eating Club members, will
be asked to vote for the ICC-
Toyon club representative.
YVeining's stand is that Miss
Rodenhouse's interpretation dis
enfranchises the Ealing Club
members who live off-campus
since they will not be able to vote
for an off-campus representative,
but must vote for a ICC-Toyon
representative."

AN APPEAL concerning
Elections Committee Chairman
Elna Rodenhouse's interpretation
of the constitution will be made
to Legislature tonight. Dick Wei
nig, candidate for ICC-Toyon i-ep
resentative to Legislature, will
appeal Miss Rodenhouse's state
ment "Unless Legislature decides
otherwise, all residents of Toyon
and all Eating Club members, will
be asked to vote for the ICC-
Toyon club representative.
YVeining's stand is that Miss
Rodenhouse's interpretation dis
enfranchises the Ealing Club
members who live off-campus
since they will not be able to vote
for an off-campus representative,
but must vote for a ICC-Toyon
representative."

emerge yesterday as presidential
nominees gave talks to living

Criticism of the present admin
istration ran high. Jim McGee

ineffective in promting or helping
to direct the increasingly dynamic
University program and the ex
cellent secondary student organ
izatins at Stanfrd."
Boh Sayler, also running for
ASSU president, took a similar
stand, saying "While University
and student affairs were growing,
student government had begun to
die a little before it had fully ma
tured as a result of overburdened
and ineffective leadership."
COMMENTING on McGee's
statement "by reorganizing its
government the Stanford student
body can take the leadership it
deserves on the West Coast."
David Kelley said "McGee's state
ment implies that change in struc
ture is needed. I believe that we
need more effective use of the or
ganization which we already
have."
