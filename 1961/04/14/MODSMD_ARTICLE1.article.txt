# Election Squabble Aired at LASSU
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing: Editor 
Legislature, in a
sometimes tense meeting which
was at one point, called into exec
utive session to bar The Daily re
porter, last night;
• Heard Elna Rodenhouse, elec
tions commission chairman, re
port a charge that ASSU presi
dential candidate Jim McGee has
control of the Tyon and Stern
votes—which McGee completely
denied when contacted later.
• Over-ruled her and declared
three candidates eligible to run
for Legislature who she had de
clared ineligible.
• Tried unsuccessfully to go
into executive session another
time in order to bar The Daily
from reporting discussion on the
issue of whether the three candi

dates should be ruled ineligible or
eligible to run.
MISS RODENHOUSE said the
charge that McGee controls the
Stern-Toyon vote was made to her
by Scotty Thompson, Politicial
Union president, and Steve
Corker. She gave this as a main
reason why polls should not be
set up at Toyon and Stern during
elections.
After hearing the charges,
LASSU voted 13-7 not to establish
polls at the two dorms. All of her
comments were made after
LASSU had gone into executive
session on the motion of Off-Cam
pus Representative Tom Reilly.
THE MOVE was made so The
Daily would be barred from that
part of the meeting and thus
could not report what went. on.
But a LASSU member later told
The Daily what happened during

the closed-door session.
McGee, who was not informed
prior to the meeting that the
charges would be brought up,
was not present to defend him
self.
But he told the Daily when con
tacted that he is not attempting
to control the Stern-Toyon vote,
and that he did not see how such
a vote could be controlled.
HE POINTED OUT that he is
conducting his most intensive
campaigning on The Row, and
that his objective is to win votes

from all over campus. McGee is
an eating club member, and lives
off-campus.
Thompson, when called by the
Daily, said "I am not working ac
tively for any one candidate.
However, this (the placing of bal
lot boxes in Toyon and Stern) is
an unfair advantage to one can
didate—to put boxes in living
groups which would tend to vote
for one candidate. This is an un
fair advantage." He said he told
Miss Rodenhouse this is a private
conversation.
DURING THE SECRET session,
Miss Rodenhouse also said that a
person in Stern had contacted her
and said he would be willing to
set up polling places manned by
persons approved by David Lari
mer, assistant dean of men and
director of Stern, to prevent
fraudulent voting.
But the elections chairman said
"I trust nobody." She also ac
cused the vice-chairman of last
fall's elections commission of
tampering with 72 ballots during
fall elections.
In other election action, LAS
SU gave approval for David Krat
ter, Allen Alexander and Robert
Korten to run for off-campus
LASSU representative.

troversy and news of other im
