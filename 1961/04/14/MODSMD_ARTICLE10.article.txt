"Don't resign to bloodshed,"
Dorothy Day urged an audience
of 100 last night in the Little
Theater.

Speaking on "Religion and Rev
olution," the editor of the Catholic
Worker stated that non-violence is
the Christian democratic way to
insure peace. She emphasized that
man must use his spiritual as well
as his physical potential to avoid
war.

The concept of "brother helping
brother," such as practiced in
commune farms, as well as meth
ods of peace walks and pickets,
are important means of keeping
man's freedoms alive, she said.
To explain the Catholic Worker
moement, Miss Day related some
of her unusual and interesting ex
periences. Watching unemployed
beg for jobs, food and clothing,
being a target of gunshot fired by
men determined to destroy com
munal farms, serving jail sen
tences, as well as speaking to uni
versities, pacifist groups, and
other interested parties, were all
part of her active work.
The Catholic Worker starts at
the bottom "... by bringing ideas
to the man on the street," she
said. Slowly and deliberately, she
maintained, eventual non-violent
revolution will occur for the paci
fists.
