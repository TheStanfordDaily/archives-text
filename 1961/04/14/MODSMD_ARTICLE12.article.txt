# Frosh Class Fails To Run Candidates
## 
### 
The student body election campaign has gotten off to the best
start in the last few years with the student body presidential candi
dates each bringing forth positive plans for improvement of Stan
ford's student government. Their thoughts are symptomatic of the
widely held view that new life must be injected into the central
system of our student body.

One black spot does exist in the election race and it is in the spot
we would least likely suspect. The class of 1964. These were the
Wilbur men, who in the depths of a-losing football season, led the
campus to new heights in spirit. These are the men and women
who took the time for a deep look at the Fundamental Standard.
But unfortunately they did not take the interest in running for class
officers. Only John L. McCarthy and Sally Moran filed for president
and vice-president. Mr. McCarthy's platform has said that "since
it is impossible for the Sophomore Class to elect any representatives
to either LASSU or Men's Council, it will be the goal of the Sopho
more Class government to represent its members and to effectively
promote the best of their interests." This is a pretty impotent plat
form for a class which has the talent and drive that this freshman
class has already shown. However, with only one candidate run
ning, it is fairly clear that no new ideas will be presented for running
a class government, for there is no incentive due to a lack of
competition. We hope the freshman class will show some spunk
so that over the weekend effective write-in campaigns will be or
ganized to provide this incentive.
