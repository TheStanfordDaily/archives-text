Misses Point
It has become obvious to the
readers of The Daily that its edi
toris rather adept at missing the
point. The editorial on the Peace
Corps is an excellent example of
this rather singular talent. The
editorial states that a program
based upon the doing of good for
its own sake is doomed to fail
ure, because it would either con
flict with, or fail to supplement
the basic national purpose, which
is the destruction of communism.
This statement expresses the
cold-war-philosophy which has
dominated the world in recent
years. The editor apparently sees
the Peace Corps as just another
extension of the cold-war. If the
Peace Corps did become just an
other means of "fighting com
munism" it would be doomed to
failure, because the people it pro
poses to aid are not interested in
the prospects of being manipu
lated for the presumed self-inter
ests of the participants of the
grams in recent years have fre
quently been considered as weap
ons to be used in the destruction
of communism. Situations such
as Laos are fitting testimonials
to their effectiveness. Many of
the leaders of the present admin
istration have repeatedly stated
that our foreign aid, of which
the Peace Corps is a part, must
not be given as a response to the
menace of communism, but be
cause it is right. The Peace Corps
would still be a good idea, and
our foreign aid programs would
still be needed, even if commu
nisim had never been invented.
It is not our own self interest
which should determine our for
eign policy, but the self interest
of the human race, because that
has become the only meaningful
unit in the present world. The
Peace Corps should be based
upon this premise, and not upon
a paranoid fear of communism,
which feels that the answer to
the world's misery is the destruc
tion of communism.
The comparision between the
training periods for the Peace
Corps and for the Foreign Serv
ice is not valid, because the tasks
and level of operation of each
are quite different. One would
imagine that a brief, intensive
training period would act more as
a screening device than as a
means for imparting a great deal
of detailed information, since the
participants would be chosen in
the first place because thep pos
sessed a needed skill. Anyone
who has been in contact with any
of the so-called underdeveloped
areas knows that the success of

the members of the Peace Corps
will depend not on a vast de
tailed knowledge of social and po
litical affairs, but on a basic emo
tional and physical ability to
adapt to any condition while they
set about their job.
The editor of The Daily has
probably decided not to apply for
the Peace Corps, and if this is
so, I can only applaud his de
cision.

Legal Niceties
I read with interest the article
written by Ilene Strelitz concern
ing the Eichmann trial, which ap
peared in Monday's Daily.
She quotes, as do many of the
ponents of capital punishment,
Exodus 20:13: "Thou shalt not
kill," in support of her views. I
would like to express a contrary
opinion. It seems to me that the
sixth commandment, taken in con
text, prohibits murder rather than
judicial execution, and that it was
so understood by the Israelites.
For instance, in Exodus 21:12-14
murder is made a capital offense,
and in Numbers 15:32-36 we read
of a man executed by the direct
command of God for violating the
Sabbath. There may well be good
arguments against capital punish
ment, but I doubt if they will be
found in the Mosaic law. As to
Eichmann, if he is guilty of the
atrocities attributed to him, I
think his release would be far
more a perversion of justice than
his execution, whatever may be
the legal niceties involved.

Communist Tool
The John Birch Society is a
Communist tool whether the
members want it to be or think
it is. Whenever there are neigh
bors accusing neighbors of being
Communists, it creates dissention
and suspicion. These two qualities
are food for the growth of inter
national Communism. I am ac
quainted with only one member
of this society; she spends eight
hours a day distributing anti-
Communist literature to the com
munity by mail. These pamphlets
give reason to accuse anyone of
being pink. The consequent accu
sations (which include one
against my minister) are usually
not believed, but the conversation
which follows is damaging. I don't
believe a duty as solemn or seri
ous as discovering and accusing
eitiens of Communist activity can
be left to untrained, unscreened
individuals.
