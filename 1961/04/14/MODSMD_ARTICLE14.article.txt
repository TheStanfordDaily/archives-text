## Bad News On A-Test Banning 
### 
We should be ready for bleak
news on test-ban and disarma
ment negotiations with the So
viets.
I suspect the real state of af
fairs will soon be out in the open
at Geneva.
THE RUSSIANS are now back
ing away from any inspectable
treaty to end the testing of nu
clear weapons.
There is yet no solid Soviet
agreement to begin the talks on
comprehensive disarmament
Aug. 1.
There is an appearance of an
agreement, but Moscow has at
tached a condition. The U.S.,
Britain, France, Canada, and the
others are ready to resume the
disarmament conference where
they left off last year. Moscow
says yes, but only if some addi
tional nations are brought to the
conference table. So there is noth
ing firm about the Aug. 1 date.
SUCH NEWS from Geneva can
only mean that the Soviets do not
want to negotiate a test-ban
agreement which has any element
of secure enforcement. Naturally
they do not say so. That would be
bad propaganda. But their actions
reveal their intentions:
1. The United States and Brit
ain have made seven significant
concessions to Soviet views on in
spection. The Russians offer noth
ing in return.
2. Actually the Soviet delegate
not only makes no return conces
sions, but he has withdrawn Rus
sian approval of one of the most
important agreements already
reached in previous Geneva meet
ings—that a single neutral admin
istrator be in charge of the test
ban control commission.
3. In place of a single neutral
administrator, Moscow now says
it will only accept a three-man
committee on which, at all points,
each would have to agree before
any inspection was authorized.
4. This means that the Soviet
Union is demanding a total veto
over any system of inspection de
signed to verify the test ban.
This means inspection only at
the will and wishes of the Krem
lin. This means that the Soviets
could stop the control machinery
any time, anywhere.
It is quite possible that the So
viets have decided that the value
of a test-ban is not equal to the
amount of inspection needed to
make it work. Or, they might
have decided that they can get
the U.S. to continue the mora
torium on testing without any in
spection agreement at all.
Whatever their reasons, the So
viets demand for a veto-laden con
trol commission makes the out
look for any kind of disarmament
agreement nearly hopeless.
IT NOW seems clear that the
Kremlin is insisting upon a veto
over any international agency
which could affect the Soviet
Union. Their demand at Geneva
for a "committee secretariat" to
run the test-ban control commis
sion is exactly what Premier
Khrushchev has been demanding
at the U.N.—a committee to run
the secretariat of the United Na

tions with a Soviet veto over any
action.
Is there any reason to think
that the Soviets will accept a veto
free inspection system for general
disarmament when they will not
accept a veto-free control commis
sion to verify the test ban?
Thus far the Soviet record at
Geneva is a dismal dashing of
the hopes of the whole world for
serious negotiation.

over any international agency
which could affect the Soviet
Union. Their demand at Geneva
for a "committee secretariat" to
run the test-ban control commis
sion is exactly what Premier
Khrushchev has been demanding
at the U.N.—a committee to run
the secretariat of the United Na

tions with a Soviet veto over any
action.
Is there any reason to think
that the Soviets will accept a veto
free inspection system for general
disarmament when they will not
accept a veto-free control commis
sion to verify the test ban?
Thus far the Soviet record at
Geneva is a dismal dashing of
the hopes of the whole world for
serious negotiation.

We should be ready for bleak
news on test-ban and disarma
ment negotiations with the So
viets.
I suspect the real state of af
fairs will soon be out in the open
at Geneva.
THE RUSSIANS are now back
ing away from any inspectable
treaty to end the testing of nu
clear weapons.
There is yet no solid Soviet
agreement to begin the talks on
comprehensive disarmament
Aug. 1.
There is an appearance of an
agreement, but Moscow has at
tached a condition. The U.S.,
Britain, France, Canada, and the
others are ready to resume the
disarmament conference where
they left off last year. Moscow
says yes, but only if some addi
tional nations are brought to the
conference table. So there is noth
ing firm about the Aug. 1 date.
SUCH NEWS from Geneva can
only mean that the Soviets do not
want to negotiate a test-ban
agreement which has any element
of secure enforcement. Naturally
they do not say so. That would be
bad propaganda. But their actions
reveal their intentions:
1. The United States and Brit
ain have made seven significant
concessions to Soviet views on in
spection. The Russians offer noth
ing in return.
2. Actually the Soviet delegate
not only makes no return conces
sions, but he has withdrawn Rus
sian approval of one of the most
important agreements already
reached in previous Geneva meet
ings—that a single neutral admin
istrator be in charge of the test
ban control commission.
3. In place of a single neutral
administrator, Moscow now says
it will only accept a three-man
committee on which, at all points,
each would have to agree before
any inspection was authorized.
4. This means that the Soviet
Union is demanding a total veto
over any system of inspection de
signed to verify the test ban.
This means inspection only at
the will and wishes of the Krem
lin. This means that the Soviets
could stop the control machinery
any time, anywhere.
It is quite possible that the So
viets have decided that the value
of a test-ban is not equal to the
amount of inspection needed to
make it work. Or, they might
have decided that they can get
the U.S. to continue the mora
torium on testing without any in
spection agreement at all.
Whatever their reasons, the So
viets demand for a veto-laden con
trol commission makes the out
look for any kind of disarmament
agreement nearly hopeless.
IT NOW seems clear that the
Kremlin is insisting upon a veto
over any international agency
which could affect the Soviet
Union. Their demand at Geneva
for a "committee secretariat" to
run the test-ban control commis
sion is exactly what Premier
Khrushchev has been demanding
at the U.N.—a committee to run
