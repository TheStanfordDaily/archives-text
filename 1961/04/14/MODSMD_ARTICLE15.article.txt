# FROM THE PRESIDENTS OFFICE
## Student Government Suffers From Case of Inactivitis' 
### BARRY GREENBERG Public Relations Assistant to The Student Body President 
(Editor's Note: The following is Barry Greenberg's first article in
his newly appointed capacity as Public Relations Assistant to Student
Body President Larry Royse.)

Student government is a waste. Student government is for those
who do not like to study. Legislature is a popularly elected group
whose discussions and decisions represent few persons and benefit
fewer.
Those prevalent opinions are not wholly inaccurate. Student gov
ernment at Stanford, as at most other institutions, suffers from

an acute case of "inactivitis."
Legislature, the most important
body of student government, is
composed of sincere, intelligent
and busy students. They meet
every Thursday night for a cou
ple of hours and also attend sev
eral committee meetings. But
they do little.
AS STORIES in The Daily in
dicate, Legislature meetings are
usually drab affairs, replete with
windy orations signifying noth
ing, long diatribes on the alloca
tion of a few farthings.
But all is not hopeless. Legisla
ture must not always remain
mired in its own mediocrity. At
least we think not. Which is the
purpose of this column and ones
to follow. Student body elections
will be held next week (the pri
maries) and the week following
(the finals). All of the candidates
who are running for President
are aware that student govern
ment needs an overhauling.
BUT NO one is sure quite where
to begin. This column will try to
focus on what could and should
be the issues with which the can
didates should confront them
selves. The candidates' platforms
will be carefully scrutinized and
criticized.
The biggest problem confront-

ing student government is stu
dents who remain cynically op
posed to it. Perhaps they have a
right to be cynical. After all they
don't know what student govern
ment really is giving the average
student. But it does not have to
be ever thus.
Here are some problems the
candidates are undoubtedly pon
dering. Relations between a rep
resentative and his constitutents
are tenuous. Surely they could be
developed to a far more effective
degree.
IF THE Legislature is to be ef
fective, it should be relieved of
unnecessary tasks which reduce
the importance of its delibera
tions If your deliberations are
unimportant, you lose prestige
among the students.
The President's executive re
sponsibility is compromised by
the constitutional system, the
extra-constitutional functions
now being performed by the Stu
dent Financial Manager. The
President is supposed to direct
the executive branch. Actually,
there hasn't been an executive
branch as such.
There is also the problem of
annual turnover which leads to
perennial inexperience. Perhaps
some training program should be
instituted to provide training for
prospective student government
officers.
These are but a few of the
problems and by no means the
most serious. Other issues will be
discussed in relation to the can
didates' platforms and it is hoped
that students will take an active
interest in improving their stu
dent government by also exam
ining the platforms.

don't know what student govern

student. But it does not have to
be ever thus.
Here are some problems the
candidates are undoubtedly pon
dering. Relations between a rep

are tenuous. Surely they could be

degree.
IF THE Legislature is to be ef

unimportant, you lose prestige

The President's executive re
sponsibility is compromised by
the constitutional system, the
extra-constitutional functions
now being performed by the Stu

President is supposed to direct
the executive branch. Actually,
there hasn't been an executive
branch as such.
There is also the problem of
annual turnover which leads to
perennial inexperience. Perhaps
some training program should be
instituted to provide training for
prospective student government
officers.
These are but a few of the
problems and by no means the
most serious. Other issues will be
discussed in relation to the can

dent government by also exam
ining the platforms.

Body President Larry Royse.)

Student government is a waste. Student government is for those
who do not like to study. Legislature is a popularly elected group
whose discussions and decisions represent few persons and benefit
fewer.
Those prevalent opinions are not wholly inaccurate. Student gov
ernment at Stanford, as at most other institutions, suffers from

an acute case of "inactivitis."
Legislature, the most important
body of student government, is
composed of sincere, intelligent
and busy students. They meet
every Thursday night for a cou
ple of hours and also attend sev
eral committee meetings. But
they do little.
AS STORIES in The Daily in
dicate, Legislature meetings are
usually drab affairs, replete with
windy orations signifying noth
ing, long diatribes on the alloca
tion of a few farthings.
But all is not hopeless. Legisla
ture must not always remain
mired in its own mediocrity. At
least we think not. Which is the
purpose of this column and ones
to follow. Student body elections
will be held next week (the pri
maries) and the week following
(the finals). All of the candidates
who are running for President
are aware that student govern
ment needs an overhauling.
BUT NO one is sure quite where
to begin. This column will try to
focus on what could and should
be the issues with which the can
didates should confront them
selves. The candidates' platforms
will be carefully scrutinized and
criticized.
