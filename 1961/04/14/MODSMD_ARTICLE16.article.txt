HAPPINESS CAN'T BUY MONEY

With tuition costs spiralling ever upward, more and more under
graduates are investigating the student loan plan. If you are
one who is considering the "Learn Now, Pay Later"system, you
would do well first to study the case of Leonid Sigafoos.
Leonid, the son of an upholsterer in Straitened Circum
stances, Idaho, had his heart set on going to college, but his
father, alas, could not afford to send him. Leonid applied for
a Regents Scholarship, but his reading speed, alas, was not
very rapid—two words an hour —and before he could finish the
first page of his test the Regents had closed their brief cases
crossly and gone home. Leonid then applied for an athletic
scholarship, but he had, alas, only a single athletic skill—
balancing a stick on his chin—and this, alas, aroused only
passing enthusiasm among the coaches.

And then, huzzah, Leonid learned of the student loan plan:
he could borrow money for his tuition and repay it in easy
monthly installments after he left school!
Happily Leonid enrolled in the Southeastern Idaho College
of Woodpulp and Restoration Drama and happily began a
college career that grew more happy year by year. Indeed, it
became altogether ecstatic in his senior year because Leonid met
a coed named Salina T. Nem with hair like beaten gold and
eyes like two squirts of Lake Louise. Love gripped them in its
big moist palm and they were betrothed on the Eve of St. Agnes.
Happily they made plans to be married the day after com
mencement—plans, alas, that never were to come to fruition
because Leonid, alas, learned that Salina, like himself, was in
college on a student loan, which meant that he had not only
to repay his own loan when he left school but also Salina's, and
the job, alas, that was waiting for Leonid after graduation at
the Boise Raccoon Works simply did not pay enough, alas, to
cover both their loans, plus rent and food and clothing.
Sick at heart, Leonid and Salina sat down and lit Marlboro
Cigarettes and tried to find an answer to their problem—and,
sure enough, they did! Ido not know whether or not Marlboro
Cigarettes helped them find an answer; all I know, is that
Marlboros taste good and look good, and when things close in
and a feller needs a friend and the world is black as the pit from
pole to "pdV, it is a heap of comfort and satisfaction to be sure
that Marlboros provide the same unflagging pleas
ure, the same unstinting quality, in all times and climes and
conditions. That's all I know.
Leonid and Salina, I say, did find an answer—a very simple
one. If their student loans did not come due until they left
school, why, then they just wouldn't leave school! So after
receiving their bachelor degrees, they re-enrolled and took
masters degrees. After that they took doctors degrees, loads and
loads of them, until today Leonid and Salina, both aged 78, both
still in school, hold doctorates in Philosophy, Humane Letters,
Jurisprudence, Veterinary Medicine, Civil Engineering, Op
tometry, and Dewey Decimals. Their student loans, as of last
January 1, amounted to a combined total of eighteen million
dollars, a sum which they probably would have found great
difficulty in repaying had not the Department of the Interior
recently declared them a National Park.
