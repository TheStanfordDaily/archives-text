# LEAGUE OPENER
## Indian Trackmen Invade UCLA 
### BILL BLACK 
The Stanford track team will
get its first taste of this year's
Big Five competition when it
meets UCLA tomorrow in Los An
geles.

The Bruins have one of the top
teams in the nation, but the Cards
have been improving fast and are
determined to upset the mighty
southerners.
LEADING the Indian attack
will be co-captain Rich Klier and
Don Bell.

Klier ran the 880 in 1:51.1 in
the triangular meet with San Jose
State and Occidental, giving him
the third best time in the nation
for the year. He will also be en
tered in the 440 and will anchor
the mile relay team.
Bell, a consistant point-getter
last year, will compete in the
discus throw and the high jump.
HIS BEST throw of the year is
a respectable 166-5 but he will be
facing stiff competition from
Bruins Gerald Carr and Jack Put
nam, both of whom have made
throws of over 170 this year.

Junior Art Batchelder will
enter the javelin throw. Last
week he unleashed a throw of
233-3 which is the best heave of
his life and placed him third in
the nation for the year. However,
he will probably have to do even
better if he is to beat C. K. Yang,
who got off the year's top toss
last week against Cal.
Four others who should give
the Cards added strength in the
field events are Dave Weill, John
Fontius, Dan Moore and Phil
White.
WEILL HAS been pressing
Bell in the discus and earlier in
the season got off a throw of
170-%.
Fontius got a late start this
year because of his basketball ac
tivities but already has a mark of
6-4 *4 -in the high jump and
jumped 6-8 in practice this week.
Moore broad jumped 24-1 in the
meet last weekend and is followed
closely in this event by Charles
Earth and Craig Barrett.
White will be entered in the
pole vault. His best vault of the
season is 14-4 and he should pro
vide a lot of competition for
Yang and Bill Logan of UCLA.
LEN BRESCHINI and Phil La
moreaux will be Stanford's en
trants in the sprints. They will
have a tough time beating Bruins
Arnold Tripp and Chris Knott,
two of the top men in the country.
The indians chances in the 440
were hurt when Chris Hunger
land was forced out for the sea
son with a toe injury. Taking up
the slack will be Ken Emanuels
who ran a 47.9 race last year as
a freshman.
John Northway, who. has been
improving fast in the mile this
year, will face a stiff test when
he meets Mil Dahl of UCLA but
it should be an interesting race.

LEN BRESCHINI and Phil La
moreaux will be Stanford's en
trants in the sprints. They will
have a tough time beating Bruins
Arnold Tripp and Chris Knott,
two of the top men in the country.
The indians chances in the 440
were hurt when Chris Hunger
land was forced out for the sea
son with a toe injury. Taking up
the slack will be Ken Emanuels
who ran a 47.9 race last year as
a freshman.
John Northway, who. has been
improving fast in the mile this
year, will face a stiff test when
he meets Mil Dahl of UCLA but
it should be an interesting race.


SOPHOMORE PHIL WHITE
Best vault of 14-4 could top Bruins
The Stanford track team will
get its first taste of this year's
Big Five competition when it
meets UCLA tomorrow in Los An
geles.

The Bruins have one of the top
teams in the nation, but the Cards
have been improving fast and are
determined to upset the mighty
southerners.
LEADING the Indian attack
will be co-captain Rich Klier and
Don Bell.

Klier ran the 880 in 1:51.1 in
the triangular meet with San Jose
State and Occidental, giving him
the third best time in the nation
for the year. He will also be en
tered in the 440 and will anchor
the mile relay team.
Bell, a consistant point-getter
last year, will compete in the
discus throw and the high jump.
HIS BEST throw of the year is
a respectable 166-5 but he will be
facing stiff competition from
Bruins Gerald Carr and Jack Put
nam, both of whom have made
throws of over 170 this year.

Junior Art Batchelder will
enter the javelin throw. Last
week he unleashed a throw of
233-3 which is the best heave of
his life and placed him third in
the nation for the year. However,
he will probably have to do even
better if he is to beat C. K. Yang,
who got off the year's top toss
last week against Cal.
Four others who should give
the Cards added strength in the
field events are Dave Weill, John
Fontius, Dan Moore and Phil
White.
WEILL HAS been pressing
Bell in the discus and earlier in
the season got off a throw of
170-%.
Fontius got a late start this
year because of his basketball ac
tivities but already has a mark of
6-4 *4 -in the high jump and
jumped 6-8 in practice this week.
Moore broad jumped 24-1 in the
meet last weekend and is followed
closely in this event by Charles
Earth and Craig Barrett.
White will be entered in the
pole vault. His best vault of the
season is 14-4 and he should pro
vide a lot of competition for
Yang and Bill Logan of UCLA.
LEN BRESCHINI and Phil La
