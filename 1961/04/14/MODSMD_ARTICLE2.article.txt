# Foreign Campuses Get ASSU Ballots
## 
### 
Primary election ballots were
flown to the foreign campuses
yesterday as part of the prepara
tions for the ASSU primaries to
be held next Wednesday and
Thursday.
Here on campus presidential
platforms crystalized a little as
presidential nominees continued
to address living groups.
JIM McGEE, ASSU presidential
nominee, disputed Dave Kelly's
disagreement with McGee's reor
ganizational plans. Wednesday
Kelly stated "We need more ef
fective use of the organization
which we already have rather
than a new structure."
Concerning his reorganizational
plans, McGee replied, "I suggest
that the president with the cabi
net should concern himself with
initiating the substantive legisla

tion and thus the legislative pro
cess would become action
oriented."
BOTH KELLY and Bob Saylor
emphasized the need for more ef
fective use of the potential human
energy to be found on campus.
Speaking at Wilbur, Sayler stated,
"Great energy and ability is going
untapped while ASSU, flounders
for lack of enough qualified, earn
est manpower."
Kelly focused his talk at Wilbur
on "the campus-wide surge to
wards 'the new enthusiasm.' " To
ward the end of generating new
enthusiasm Kelly suggested,
"Adequate publicity for tryouts
and more complete definition and
evolution of the various student
activities would generate student
interest."
SAYLER advocated the submis
sion of LASSU agendas and pub
lication in The Daily one week
before scheduled meetings, a per
manent public relations assistant
to the president, a more active
cabinet with more responsibility
and delegated authority and ex
tensive use of freshmen on ASSU
investigatory commissions.
Candidates will be introduced at
dinner at Lagunita Court Sunday
night in continuation of the ex
tensive program of rallies and
living group talks being held be
fore the election.
In order to provide the campus
with information about the candi
dates, The Daily will publish an
elections issue Wednesday con
taining pictures of the candidates
and statements of their platforms.
