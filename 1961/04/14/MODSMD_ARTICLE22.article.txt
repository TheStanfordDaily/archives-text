## Indian Nine Will Host Powers From Southland 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseballers get a crack at the league leaders
this weekend as they take on USC and UCLA in search of their first
CIBA win. The Indians square off against the Trojans today at
3 p.m. and meet the Bruins tomorrow for a 1 p.m. doubleheader.
Mark Miller gets the important starting assignment this afternoon,
facing what many believe to be the strongest baseball team in the
country. Miller hasn't worked since last Saturday when he went
four innings against Pepperdine and picked up the win. He is now
4-1 on the season.

THE TROJANS who went to
the NCAA finals last season
only to lose to Minnesota, 2-1, ap
pear to be loaded again. They
boast the first and third ranking
hitters in the league after just
three games.
Larry Himes, toting a .571 bat
ting average, is currently tied
with the Cards' own Rich Ferraz
zano for the CIBA's leading bats
man. Center fielder Kenny Wash
ington is right behind these two
with a .500 mark.
The Trojans now stand 2-1 with
the league/ having been upset by
the California Bears. They trail
both Cal and UCLA but have
played fewer games and are even
in that all-important loss column.
THE" BRUINS, of course, are
no strangers to Stanford, having
written a rather dismal chapter in
the Cards' otherwise bright rec
ord. UCLA hosted Stanford in a
pair of league openers and pulled
out close victories both times by
scores of 4-3 and 5-3.
Coach Dutch FeJfring has
named Jim Smith and ftfarv Meck
lenberg to oppose the heavy Bruin
artillery. Ray Zak, a 19-year-old
sophomore who tips the scales at
a hefty 150 pounds, leads the
Bruins with a .412 average in
their five league games.
PERHAPS a greater threat is
center fielder Tebbie Fowler, who
is well over the .300 mark for
the overall season but is not
found among the leaders in CIBA
play. Fowler and Butch Wright,
another of Westwood's prize soph
omores, supply the power in the
Bruin lineup.
UCLA, 4-1 in league-play, face
the Santa Clara Broncos, the only
team to beat them in league play,
today.

Coach Dutch FeJfring has
named Jim Smith and ftfarv Meck
lenberg to oppose the heavy Bruin
artillery. Ray Zak, a 19-year-old
sophomore who tips the scales at
a hefty 150 pounds, leads the
Bruins with a .412 average in
their five league games.
PERHAPS a greater threat is
center fielder Tebbie Fowler, who
is well over the .300 mark for
the overall season but is not
found among the leaders in CIBA
play. Fowler and Butch Wright,
another of Westwood's prize soph
omores, supply the power in the
Bruin lineup.
UCLA, 4-1 in league-play, face
the Santa Clara Broncos, the only
team to beat them in league play,
today.
Stanford's varsity baseballers get a crack at the league leaders
this weekend as they take on USC and UCLA in search of their first
CIBA win. The Indians square off against the Trojans today at
3 p.m. and meet the Bruins tomorrow for a 1 p.m. doubleheader.
Mark Miller gets the important starting assignment this afternoon,
facing what many believe to be the strongest baseball team in the
country. Miller hasn't worked since last Saturday when he went
four innings against Pepperdine and picked up the win. He is now
4-1 on the season.

THE TROJANS who went to
the NCAA finals last season
only to lose to Minnesota, 2-1, ap
pear to be loaded again. They
boast the first and third ranking
hitters in the league after just
three games.
Larry Himes, toting a .571 bat
ting average, is currently tied
with the Cards' own Rich Ferraz
zano for the CIBA's leading bats
man. Center fielder Kenny Wash
ington is right behind these two
with a .500 mark.
The Trojans now stand 2-1 with
the league/ having been upset by
the California Bears. They trail
both Cal and UCLA but have
played fewer games and are even
in that all-important loss column.
THE" BRUINS, of course, are
no strangers to Stanford, having
written a rather dismal chapter in
the Cards' otherwise bright rec
ord. UCLA hosted Stanford in a
pair of league openers and pulled
out close victories both times by
scores of 4-3 and 5-3.
