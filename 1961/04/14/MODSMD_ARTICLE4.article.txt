# SU Water Rationing Declared
## 
### 
Stanford, hit by its worst water
shortage in 60 years, goes on
strict water rationing today.
In a letter to all residents, S. F.
Post, assistant business manager
and director of the physical plant,
asked that cars be washed with
buckets of water, not hoses, and
that lawns be watered only twice
a week.
HE URGED faculty and resi
dents not to install any new
flower or vegetable gardens and
limit watering of existing land
scaping to 10 to 20 minutes at a
time.
"Rainfall this year ... on cam
pus has been less than any year
on record. This follows two dry
years, making our water situa
tion critical," he said.
He pointed out that Felt and
Searsville lakes are "extremely
low" and that Lake Lagunita is
dry. Stanford has had 8.75 inches
of rain this year, compared to a
normal for this time of 13 or 14
inches.
IN HIS letter, Post advised
campus residents to "check . . .
faucets, piping and plumbing and
correct any leaks. . . . We would
suggest also that residents not
start any new planting of flower
gardens or vegetable gardens."
For rationing purposes, the
campus residential areas have
been divided into six zones, with
residents in each zone having a
schedule of watering to follow.
The University Grounds Depart
ment is following a similar sched
ule.
POST suggested watering to
be kept to early morning or
early evening hours to minimize
evaporation.
He also asked "that washing
of automobiles with hoses be dis
continued."
He told residents, "With your
cooperation, we hope to get
through this year without resort
ing to full emergency measures."
