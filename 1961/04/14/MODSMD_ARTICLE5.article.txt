# Sponsors: A Full Time Job'
## 
### RICH HAWKINS Head Sponsor, Wilbur 
(Editor's Note: This article is
the last in a series on sponsoring
at Stanford.)

It is no secret that Stanford's
freshman program is not the Uni
versity's most significant contri
bution to the education of its stu
dents: all of us who have been
freshmen certainly know this, and
the University itself is currently
re-evaluating the first year.
Until the fruits of this rethink
ing are felt in concrete changes in
curriculum and living arrange
ments, the freshman sponsor will

continue to be as crucial a figure
in the life of the students as he
has been in the past. A good spon
sor will often mean a good year
for a freshman; too many of us
—even those who are now spon
sors—know what a bad sponsor
can do.
IT IS FOR this reason that the
sponsors and the dean's office
feel that sponsoring presents such
a worthwhile challenge to men
and women at Stanford who feel
committed to the idea that educa
tion is a good thing, and that we
ought to see more of it at this
University from the first year
on up.
There are indeed signs that edu
cation here is becoming increas
ingly a good thing: the strength
ened courses, the new additions
to the faculty, the overseas cam
puses, the revitalized Political
Union and lIR all contribute to a
healthy ferment and atmosphere
of impatience, of wanting to get
down to brass tacks.
Few students have escaped the
efforts of this new activity; part
of the improvements which need
to be made in the freshman pro
gram are precisely in bringing
more of this fresh thought and ac
tion into the Wilbur houses. The
impact of the first year is surely
a formative one, establishing as
it does many habits which remain
for the remaining college years.
WE OWE IT to ourselves, to the
University, and certainly to the
freshmen to see that this job gets
done.
This is in fact the prime respon
sibility of the sponsor program:
sponsors are the link between the
freshmen and the rest of the Uni
versity, and in partnership with
the faculty and the administra
tion can lay solid foundations
from the very first, so that the
future classes of Stanford stu
dents will be better equipped to
meet the obligations they will
face.
To do this job well, it is essen
tial that the sponsor program
draw its manpower from those
who have an allegiance to educa

tion and to intellectual activity in
the broad sense of the word. It
is also essential for the sponsor
program to find its men from
among those who have a commit
ment to put something back into
Stanford by showing others the
way to gain even more.
APPLICATIONS for sponsoring
next year in the eight houses of
Wilbur Hall are now available in
the main office at Wilbur, and
must be returned by 5 p.m. today.
Candidates should make an ap
pointment for personal interview
when they return the completed
application. The interviews will
be held today through Thursday.
The sponsor selection commit
tee composed of five present
sponsors—is seeking men with an
understanding of the goals and
opportunities of the University,
who have convictions and the ca
pacity for commitment, and men
who can accept a responsibility
toward the residence and spon
soring programs.
Those men and women selected
to be sponsors for next year will
be notified by mail by April 30
and will then participate in a
short orientation program as
guests of the University May 5-7
at a hostel in the Santa Cruz
Mountains. They will be briefed
by President Sterling, Dean Craig,
Dr. Walker and others on the
background and purposes of the
freshman program.
SPONSORS also will return to
Stanford five days before the
freshman preregistration week
next September for further con
sultation with the University ad
ministration and the faculty and
for hammering out on their own
the shape of the first year as they
would wish to see it.
Sponsoring is a full-time job;
the only specific pay is free room,
and that only for the men. The
responsibilities and challenges
should be obvious even from this
short sketch; £he chance for per
sonal growth is equally as great.
Many of us have as our only re
gret the certainty that we have
received far more than we have
given.

from the very first, so that the
future classes of Stanford stu

meet the obligations they will

To do this job well, it is essen

draw its manpower from those
who have an allegiance to educa

The sponsor selection commit

soring programs.
Those men and women selected
to be sponsors for next year will
be notified by mail by April 30
and will then participate in a
short orientation program as

for hammering out on their own
the shape of the first year as they
would wish to see it.
Sponsoring is a full-time job;
the only specific pay is free room,

It is no secret that Stanford's
freshman program is not the Uni
versity's most significant contri
bution to the education of its stu
dents: all of us who have been
freshmen certainly know this, and
the University itself is currently
re-evaluating the first year.
Until the fruits of this rethink
ing are felt in concrete changes in
curriculum and living arrange
ments, the freshman sponsor will

continue to be as crucial a figure
in the life of the students as he
has been in the past. A good spon
sor will often mean a good year
for a freshman; too many of us
—even those who are now spon
sors—know what a bad sponsor
can do.
IT IS FOR this reason that the
sponsors and the dean's office
feel that sponsoring presents such
a worthwhile challenge to men
and women at Stanford who feel
committed to the idea that educa
tion is a good thing, and that we
ought to see more of it at this
University from the first year
on up.
There are indeed signs that edu
cation here is becoming increas
ingly a good thing: the strength
ened courses, the new additions
to the faculty, the overseas cam
puses, the revitalized Political
Union and lIR all contribute to a
healthy ferment and atmosphere
of impatience, of wanting to get
down to brass tacks.
Few students have escaped the
efforts of this new activity; part
of the improvements which need
to be made in the freshman pro
gram are precisely in bringing
more of this fresh thought and ac
tion into the Wilbur houses. The
impact of the first year is surely
a formative one, establishing as

(Editor's Note: This article is
the last in a series on sponsoring
at Stanford.)

It is no secret that Stanford's
freshman program is not the Uni
versity's most significant contri
bution to the education of its stu
dents: all of us who have been
freshmen certainly know this, and
the University itself is currently
re-evaluating the first year.
Until the fruits of this rethink
ing are felt in concrete changes in
curriculum and living arrange
ments, the freshman sponsor will

continue to be as crucial a figure
in the life of the students as he
has been in the past. A good spon
sor will often mean a good year
for a freshman; too many of us
—even those who are now spon
sors—know what a bad sponsor
can do.
IT IS FOR this reason that the
sponsors and the dean's office
feel that sponsoring presents such
a worthwhile challenge to men
and women at Stanford who feel
committed to the idea that educa
tion is a good thing, and that we
ought to see more of it at this
University from the first year
on up.
There are indeed signs that edu
cation here is becoming increas
ingly a good thing: the strength
ened courses, the new additions
to the faculty, the overseas cam
puses, the revitalized Political
Union and lIR all contribute to a
healthy ferment and atmosphere
of impatience, of wanting to get
down to brass tacks.
Few students have escaped the
efforts of this new activity; part
of the improvements which need
to be made in the freshman pro
gram are precisely in bringing
more of this fresh thought and ac
tion into the Wilbur houses. The
impact of the first year is surely
a formative one, establishing as
it does many habits which remain
for the remaining college years.
WE OWE IT to ourselves, to the
University, and certainly to the
freshmen to see that this job gets
done.
This is in fact the prime respon
sibility of the sponsor program:
sponsors are the link between the
freshmen and the rest of the Uni
versity, and in partnership with
the faculty and the administra
tion can lay solid foundations
from the very first, so that the
future classes of Stanford stu
dents will be better equipped to
meet the obligations they will
face.
To do this job well, it is essen
tial that the sponsor program
draw its manpower from those
who have an allegiance to educa

tion and to intellectual activity in
the broad sense of the word. It
is also essential for the sponsor
program to find its men from
among those who have a commit
ment to put something back into
Stanford by showing others the
way to gain even more.
APPLICATIONS for sponsoring
next year in the eight houses of
Wilbur Hall are now available in
the main office at Wilbur, and
must be returned by 5 p.m. today.
Candidates should make an ap
pointment for personal interview
when they return the completed
application. The interviews will
be held today through Thursday.
The sponsor selection commit
tee composed of five present
sponsors—is seeking men with an
understanding of the goals and
opportunities of the University,
who have convictions and the ca
pacity for commitment, and men
who can accept a responsibility
toward the residence and spon
soring programs.
Those men and women selected
to be sponsors for next year will
be notified by mail by April 30
and will then participate in a
short orientation program as
guests of the University May 5-7
at a hostel in the Santa Cruz
Mountains. They will be briefed
by President Sterling, Dean Craig,
Dr. Walker and others on the
background and purposes of the
freshman program.
SPONSORS also will return to
Stanford five days before the
freshman preregistration week
next September for further con
sultation with the University ad
ministration and the faculty and
for hammering out on their own
the shape of the first year as they
would wish to see it.
