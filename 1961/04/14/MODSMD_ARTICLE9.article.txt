# High Voltage Wire Kills Dr. Gallagher
## 
### 
Dr. Philip B. Gallagher, one of Stanford's top radio scientists, was
electrocuted yesterday morning when he accidentally touched a
5,000-volt high tension lead in a laboratory on the "antenna farm"
in the foothills behind the campus.
Gallagher, 33, was a senior research associate in the Stanford
Electronics Laboratories and a co-director of a solar research program
which last year made history by making radar contact with the sun.
At the time of his death the brilliant young scientist was in-

volved in research in bouncing
radar beams off trails of micro
meteorites.
AFTER THE accident occurred
at 10:45 a.m., another scientist
present, Dr. Claire Powell, admin
istered mouth-to-mouth ressuci*
tation until the station wagon
from the Stanford Fire Depart
ment arrived and took Gallagher
to the Stanford-Palo Alto Hospi
tal.
Doctors at the hospital cut open
his chest and massaged his heart
in an attempt to revive him, but
he was pronounced dead at 11:45.
Gallagher is survived by a wife,
and three daughters aged 1 to 5.
OFFICIALS described the acci
dent as follows:
Qallagher was standing behind
a transformer attempting to find
out what had been making it act
up. Dr. Philip Failer and Dr. T.
V. Haung, research assistants,
were with him.
Gallagher was holding a probe
while Failer was watching an
oscilloscope. Gallagher accidently
touched the 5,000-volt high ten
sion lead with his finger and
slumped to the floor.
HUANG immediately switched
off the electric current, while
Powell began mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.
Huang collapsed and was taker
home.
Those present could give no
reason why Gallagher, who had
worked with the equipment ex
tensively and knew its dangers,
bumped the lead.
GALLAGHER was co-director
with Von R. Eshleman, associate
professor of electrical engineer
ing, of the project which achieved
a scientific milestone when it suc
ceeded in bouncing a radar beam
off the sun's surface in April of
1959.
Gallagher received a B.S. from
Santa Clara University and an
M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford.
His body was taken to the Tin
ney Funeral Home in Palo Alto,
where funeral arrangements are
pending.

electrocuted yesterday morning when he accidentally touched a
5,000-volt high tension lead in a laboratory on the "antenna farm"
in the foothills behind the campus.
Gallagher, 33, was a senior research associate in the Stanford
Electronics Laboratories and a co-director of a solar research program
which last year made history by making radar contact with the sun.
At the time of his death the brilliant young scientist was in-

volved in research in bouncing
radar beams off trails of micro
meteorites.
AFTER THE accident occurred
at 10:45 a.m., another scientist
present, Dr. Claire Powell, admin
istered mouth-to-mouth ressuci*
tation until the station wagon
from the Stanford Fire Depart
ment arrived and took Gallagher
to the Stanford-Palo Alto Hospi
tal.
Doctors at the hospital cut open
his chest and massaged his heart
in an attempt to revive him, but
he was pronounced dead at 11:45.
Gallagher is survived by a wife,
and three daughters aged 1 to 5.
OFFICIALS described the acci
dent as follows:
Qallagher was standing behind
a transformer attempting to find
out what had been making it act
up. Dr. Philip Failer and Dr. T.
V. Haung, research assistants,
were with him.
Gallagher was holding a probe
while Failer was watching an
oscilloscope. Gallagher accidently
touched the 5,000-volt high ten
sion lead with his finger and
slumped to the floor.
HUANG immediately switched
off the electric current, while
Powell began mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.
Huang collapsed and was taker
home.
Those present could give no
reason why Gallagher, who had
worked with the equipment ex
tensively and knew its dangers,
bumped the lead.
GALLAGHER was co-director
with Von R. Eshleman, associate
professor of electrical engineer
ing, of the project which achieved
a scientific milestone when it suc
ceeded in bouncing a radar beam
off the sun's surface in April of
1959.
Gallagher received a B.S. from
Santa Clara University and an
M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford.
His body was taken to the Tin
ney Funeral Home in Palo Alto,
where funeral arrangements are
pending.
