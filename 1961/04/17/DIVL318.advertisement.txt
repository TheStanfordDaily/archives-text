Massive voice for a missile base
In America's space-age defense system, the order of the day is
total, high-speed communications.
And at Vandsnberg Air Force Base, as elsewhere, General Telephone
& Electronics is carrying out the order with efficiency and dispatch.
Here the link to the system that mans the mighty Atlas missiles
is a fully automatic 5,000-line dial telephone exchange. The "out
side voice” that links the base with alert and command posts
throughout the world is a multichannel microwave radio relay
system capable of handling hundreds of telephone conversations,
teletype messages and early-warning radar data simultaneously.
The communications equipment connecting Vandenberg Air Force
Base with the outside was designed, manufactured and installed
by our subsidiaries, Automatic Electric and Lenkurt Electric, and
is operated for the government by General Telephone of California.
This advanced high-speed system is expressive of the way General
Telephone & Electronics strives to serve the nation through better
communications - not only for national defense, but for homes,
business and industry as well.
