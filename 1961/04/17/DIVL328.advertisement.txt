Dear Dr. Frood: Our college mascot
is a great big lovable Saint Bernard.
He loves everyone—except me. In
fact, he has bitten me viciously
eight times. What can I do to get
him to like me?
Frustrated Dog Lover
DEAR FRUSTRATED: Mother him. To
carry this off, I suggest you wear a
raccoon coat, let your hair and eye
brows grow shaggy and learn to
whimper affectionately.
St-
Dear Dr. Frood: Most of my life here
is extracurricular. I carry the drum
for the band, pull the curtain for the
drama society, wax the court for the
basketball team, scrape the ice for
the hockey team, clap erasers for
the faculty club and shovel snow
for the fraternity houses. Do you
think these activities will really help
me when I get out of college?
Eager
DEAR EAGER: I don’t think the col
lege will let you out.
Dear Dr. Frood: On New Year's
Eve I foolishly resolved to be
more generous with my Luckies.
My friends have held me to this,
and I’ve been forced to give
away several packs a day. What
do you think would happen if I
broke this resolution?
Resolute,
DEAR RESOLUTE: It’s hard to
tell, really. Lightning, a runaway
horse, a tornado—who knows?

Dear Dr. Frood: Before vacation, my girl and I
agreed to exchange Christmas presents. 1 sent her
a nice hanky. You can imagine how 1 felt when I
awoke Christmas morning to find a sports car
from her. What can I do now?

' DEAR DISTRAUGHT: Remind
her that Easter giving time is

Dear Dr. Frood; Can you help me convince my girl that
I’m not as stupid as she thinks 1 am?
Anxious
DEAR ANXIOUS: Perhaps, but you’ll have to convince me
first.
TO GET A QUICK LIFT, suggests Frood, step into an elevator and light up a Lucky. In
stantly, your spirits will rise. When you savor your Lucky, you’re IN—for college students
smoke more Luckies than any other regular. They’re a wised-up bunch who’ve known
all along that Luckies taste great. Get the cigarettes with the toasted taste—get Luckies.
CHANGE TO LUCKIES and get some taste for a change!
