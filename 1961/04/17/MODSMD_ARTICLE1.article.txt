# No Deficit Budgeting — LASSU
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
Besides debating various election
issues, Legislature in its 3-hour,
15-minute meeting Thursday
night also:
• Refused to allow the ASSU to
operate on a deficit budget next
year.

• Defeated a motion to declare
an HR delegation which attended
a convention and pushed through
resolutions calling for the re
moval of Nationalist China from
the Security Council and the ad
mission of Red China to the U.N.,
and the condemnation of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee as unconstitutional,
did not necessarily reflect the
views of Stanford students.
While the resolution on the HR
did not criticize outright the dele
gation of Joel Meister, Don Light
and Nancy Sherwood which at
tended the convention of the As
sociation of International Rela
tions Clubs two weeks ago, its
intent was clear.

INTRODUCED by Stern Rep
resentative Charles Lofgren and
Off-Campus Representative Tom
Reilly, the resolution before
amendment made Stanford “ap
pear the left-wing counterpart of
the John Birch Society . .
It declared “The admission of
Communist China would compose
a travesty against the United Na
tions Declaration of Human
Rights and would sanction ag
gression, war crimes, and tyran
ny,” and called for LASSU to “in
form the HR and the . . . State
Department . . . that the actions
of the Stanford AIRC delegation
were not indicative of Stanford
student opinion or of the opinion
of their elected representatives.”

SEVERAL LASSU members
claimed, however, that the reso
lution itself was “slanted" and
could not be said to reflect neces
sarily the views of the students
or of LASSU.
The resolution finally was
amended to strike out the clauses
against Red China and the HUAC,
and the one referring to the Birch
Society. The word “necessarily”
was inserted between “not” and
“indicative of Stanford student
opinion. . . .”
But the amended measure was
defeated 13-7, with two absten
tions, and the matter was
dropped.
LASSU also heard Todd Stew
art, ASSU financial manager,
argue that he be allowed to pre
sent LASSU a budget with “ a
deficit balance of not more than
$3,777.00” for next year.
AFTER HEARING lengthy ar
gument for and against the pro
posal, Legislature voted 13-9
against it.
In the election controversy,
LASSU heeded Election Commis
sion Chairman Elna Rodenhouse’s
appeal for an interpretation of the
ASSU constitution's provisions
on:
• Must a person running for a
LASSU post reside at time of elec
tion in the group he would rep
resent? LASSU’s answer was
“No.”
• And should eating club men
living off-campus vote for off
campus representatives or the
ICC - Toyon representatives?
LASSU ruled they must vote for
off-campus rep.

argue that he be allowed to pre
sent LASSU a budget with “ a
deficit balance of not more than
$3,777.00” for next year.
AFTER HEARING lengthy ar
gument for and against the pro
posal, Legislature voted 13-9
against it.
In the election controversy,
LASSU heeded Election Commis
sion Chairman Elna Rodenhouse’s
appeal for an interpretation of the
ASSU constitution's provisions
on:
• Must a person running for a
LASSU post reside at time of elec
tion in the group he would rep
resent? LASSU’s answer was
“No.”
• And should eating club men
living off-campus vote for off
campus representatives or the
ICC - Toyon representatives?
LASSU ruled they must vote for
off-campus rep.
Besides debating various election
issues, Legislature in its 3-hour,
15-minute meeting Thursday
night also:
• Refused to allow the ASSU to
operate on a deficit budget next
year.

• Defeated a motion to declare
an HR delegation which attended
a convention and pushed through
resolutions calling for the re
moval of Nationalist China from
the Security Council and the ad
mission of Red China to the U.N.,
and the condemnation of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee as unconstitutional,
did not necessarily reflect the
views of Stanford students.
While the resolution on the HR
did not criticize outright the dele
gation of Joel Meister, Don Light
and Nancy Sherwood which at
tended the convention of the As
sociation of International Rela
tions Clubs two weeks ago, its
intent was clear.

INTRODUCED by Stern Rep
resentative Charles Lofgren and
Off-Campus Representative Tom
Reilly, the resolution before
amendment made Stanford “ap
pear the left-wing counterpart of
the John Birch Society . .
It declared “The admission of
Communist China would compose
a travesty against the United Na
tions Declaration of Human
Rights and would sanction ag
gression, war crimes, and tyran
ny,” and called for LASSU to “in
form the HR and the . . . State
Department . . . that the actions
of the Stanford AIRC delegation
were not indicative of Stanford
student opinion or of the opinion
of their elected representatives.”

SEVERAL LASSU members
claimed, however, that the reso
lution itself was “slanted" and
could not be said to reflect neces
sarily the views of the students
or of LASSU.
The resolution finally was
amended to strike out the clauses
against Red China and the HUAC,
and the one referring to the Birch
Society. The word “necessarily”
was inserted between “not” and
“indicative of Stanford student
opinion. . . .”
But the amended measure was
defeated 13-7, with two absten
tions, and the matter was
dropped.
LASSU also heard Todd Stew
art, ASSU financial manager,
argue that he be allowed to pre
sent LASSU a budget with “ a
deficit balance of not more than
$3,777.00” for next year.
