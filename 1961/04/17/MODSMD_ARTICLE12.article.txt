# Letters Debate Election

No Spirit Loss

It is indeed unfortunate that we
as freshman are not running the
usual last-minute plethora of can
didates for class office. This, how
ever, does not necessarily imply
a lack of interest, but instead a
lack of information. Prior to the
closing of nominations last Tues
day, less then 10 lines had been de
voted to class government in The
Daily, and, in addition, a hectic
Rush Week precluded much of
the usual political activity.
Moreover, the mere fact that
many of the able and active mem
bers of our class are not running
for office by no means indicates
a lack of interest in class govern
ment. Indeed, many of these peo
ple have expressed a desire to
work in a strong class organiza
tion and have already given a
great deal of thought to the ques
tion.
Class government is a contro
versial issue. Many people feel
that it is unnecessary except as a
social committee din ing the soph
omore and junior years. It should
be one of the functions of next
year’s organization to examine to
the fullest extent possible the po
tentialities of class government
and to submit, at the end of the
year, recommendations concern
ing either its justification or its
abolition. These potentialities can
be explored through the innova
tions of class meetings, straw
votes, and surveys. The Executive
Committee can also be revitalized
by making it a group of commit
tee chairmen and class represent
atives from various campus ac
tivities implementing policy
passed by the class as a whole
which may range from freshman
orientation to academic improve
ments.
It is difficult to see how The
Daily concluded that “it is fairly
clear that no new ideas will be
presented for running a class gov
ernment.” There are many people
with many ideas in our class; it
is not one person, but the entire
class whose ideas will give next
year’s government its direction.
The portion of my statement
which The Daily quoted out of
context in Friday’s editorial was
not by any means a platform nor
was it intended to be such. Within
the limit of 100 words, I decided
instead to relate a general state
ment of ideal, whose implications
evidently were not fully under
stood. A limitation of 100 words
does not lend itself to specifics.
Government, just as spirit, is
more than a matter of words. Our
class has not lost its spirit nor
does it intend to do so. With direct
expression of the class’ opinion
and a dedicated, imaginative Ex
ecutive Committee, I feel sure
that w’e can make class govern
ment an effective tool for im
provement.

Nominee for President
Class of ’64

(Editor’s Note: For (he record,
here is McCarthy's complete state
ment to The Daily:)
Stanford’s student government
can Ih* and should he an essential
part of the school's character. At
the present, however, the student
government is ineffectual be
cause it does not adequately rep
resent the students; one of the
most glaring deficiencies is (h
complete lack of regard for the
sophomore class. Since it is im
possible for the sophomore class
to elect any representatives to
either LASSU or Men's Council,
it will be the goal of the sopho
more class government to repre
sent its members and to effective
ly promote tlie* best of their in
terests.

An Assassination
It is blatant enough to print a
charge made to a secret, executive
session of legislature. But the of
fense is doubly compounded when
such a ridiculous charge has
never been made by me, when it
has been categorically denied to
the Editor of The Daily, and when
the editor did not even print the
denial.
By associating me with a
charge that the Toyon-Stern vote
is “controlled” by a specific can
didate, a patently absurd charge
I never made, the Editor of The
Daily has been guilty of yellow

journalism, the results of which
border on character assassination.
W. SCOTT THOMPSON
President,

Stern Presidents

An unfortunate misunderstand
ing has resulted in LASSU’s de
cision, as reported in Friday’s
Daily, to bar the proposed polling
places in Stern and Toyon. The j
controversy was originated by a |
few individuals who feared that j
the polling places were part of a
scheme to push one candidate for j
ASSU President. This is com- j
pletely false! The real purpose is |
to place at the disposal of all]
candidates 200-300 new voles. We I
feel that the best way to start
combating the apathy in student 1
government, which many of the i
candidates are concerned with, is j
to bring to the students the op-1
portunity to vole, thereby inter
esting some of those who have]
never voted before to go out and [
vote again in the next election,'
These new votes would also bring j
more candidates to Stern for per- j
sonal campaigning, which in it-1
self would increase interest.
It seems apparent that some]
people are afraid of the pow'er of ]
the Stern voters. However, we are [
sure that they are as interested j
as we are in increasing the in- j
terest and participation of the en
tire student body in student elec
tions. With the realization that we
have no intention of “pushing”)
any presidential candidate, we]
hope that they will poin us in in
creasing the effectiveness of stu-1
dent government by increasing j
the number of students it effec
tively and willingly represents. I
Who will Stern vote for? It will 1
be the candidate who makes the]
most determined effort to bring
the issues to us and to seriously I
campaign for our vote.

More Booths
After reading the April 14th
issue of “the Peninsula’s only 1
morning newspaper” I feel that
a closer examination of the Stern-
Toyon voting issue is desired
since the Executive Session of
LASSU was successfully exposed.
No reference was made or will be
made by me. that Jim McGee has
or will get “control” of the Stern-
Toyon vote. However, when the
issue was presented to me, I was
aware of the fact that in this elec
tion we have one independent can
didate running as opposed to five
Row men. Whether Jim McGee
will try to split University unity
by vying the independents against
the Row, is a question only time
will answer. I sincerely hope that
the best man will be selected on
his own merits and that “politics,”
such as mentioned above will not
present itself in this campaign.
When discussing, with Miss
Elna Rodenhouse, the issue of
special voting booths in Stern-
Toyon-ICC areas, she mentioned
that an independent group had ap
proached her and volunteered to
supply boxes, locks for those vot
ing boxes, and staffs to man six
booths in Stern and one each in
Toyon and the ICC area. I compli
ment the independent representa
tives for their sincere interest “to
get out the vote,” but I question
why should special booths be set
up only in this independent resi
dent area. If the Elections Com
mittee feels favorable to the ad
ditions of these booths. I then
challenge them to set up similar
facilities in all dorms and living
groups on campus.

Height of Stupidity
Your tenure on The Daily staff
has been marked by a series of
article and headlines which can
only be termed yellow journalism.
Sensationalism has been your by
word, especially since you have
been Editor of The Daily. How
ever, the publishing on the front
page of Friday’s Daily of infor
mation you gained directly from a
secret executive session of the
Legislature, which was convened
for the specific purpose of keep
ing the information aired out of
The Daily because it might have
been injurious to several candi
dates and private individuals, has
placed you at a new height of ir
responsibility and stupidity.
First of all, you violated a trust
as an ex-officio member of Legis
lature by divulging information
you heard at an executive ses
sion. Secondly, as a member of
the press, you violated the trust
placed in you by the Legislature
by printing information which
was clearly stated to you as being
off the record. And if you would
claim that you were not the Leg
islature member who told the
Managing Editor, Mr. Rankin,
what happened during the execu
tive session, then as editor and
member of the Legislature who
had been present during that ses
sion, you violated a trust by not
striking that information from
the story which your managing
editor sought to have printed.
Your desire to publish sensa
tional stories is understandable;
yet, you have overstepped the
bounds of decency and good taste
by printing sensational material
without regard to whom it in
jured, apparently because it sat
isfied your personal whims. The
lengths to which you went in Fri
day’s Daily marks you as a man
unworthy of our personal trust or
the trust of the Legislature. You
seem unable to exercise any de
gree of self-restraint or to recog
nize the responsibility you pos
sess as editor of The Daily and
as a member of the Legislature.
The blame is solely yours; how
ever, we doubt that you have the
integrity to admit your wrong
doing.

in the student body's right-to-know
what their elected and appointed
servants said.)

tions of class meetings, straw
votes, and surveys. The Executive
Committee can also be revitalized
by making it a group of commit
tee chairmen and class represent
atives from various campus ac
tivities implementing policy
passed by the class as a whole
which may range from freshman
orientation to academic improve
ments.
It is difficult to see how The
Daily concluded that “it is fairly
clear that no new ideas will be
presented for running a class gov
ernment.” There are many people
with many ideas in our class; it
is not one person, but the entire
class whose ideas will give next
year’s government its direction.
The portion of my statement
which The Daily quoted out of
context in Friday’s editorial was
not by any means a platform nor
was it intended to be such. Within
the limit of 100 words, I decided
instead to relate a general state
ment of ideal, whose implications
evidently were not fully under
stood. A limitation of 100 words
does not lend itself to specifics.
Government, just as spirit, is
more than a matter of words. Our
class has not lost its spirit nor
does it intend to do so. With direct
expression of the class’ opinion
and a dedicated, imaginative Ex
ecutive Committee, I feel sure
that w’e can make class govern
ment an effective tool for im
provement.

Stanford’s student government

government is ineffectual be

complete lack of regard for the
sophomore class. Since it is im
possible for the sophomore class
to elect any representatives to

An Assassination
It is blatant enough to print a
charge made to a secret, executive
session of legislature. But the of
fense is doubly compounded when
such a ridiculous charge has
never been made by me, when it
has been categorically denied to
the Editor of The Daily, and when
the editor did not even print the
denial.
By associating me with a
charge that the Toyon-Stern vote
is “controlled” by a specific can
didate, a patently absurd charge
I never made, the Editor of The
Daily has been guilty of yellow

journalism, the results of which
border on character assassination.

An unfortunate misunderstand
ing has resulted in LASSU’s de
cision, as reported in Friday’s
Daily, to bar the proposed polling
places in Stern and Toyon. The j
controversy was originated by a |
few individuals who feared that j
the polling places were part of a
scheme to push one candidate for j
ASSU President. This is com- j
pletely false! The real purpose is |
to place at the disposal of all]
candidates 200-300 new voles. We I
feel that the best way to start
combating the apathy in student 1
government, which many of the i
candidates are concerned with, is j
to bring to the students the op-1
portunity to vole, thereby inter
esting some of those who have]
never voted before to go out and [
vote again in the next election,'
These new votes would also bring j
more candidates to Stern for per- j
sonal campaigning, which in it-1
self would increase interest.
It seems apparent that some]
people are afraid of the pow'er of ]
the Stern voters. However, we are [
sure that they are as interested j
as we are in increasing the in- j
terest and participation of the en
tire student body in student elec
tions. With the realization that we
have no intention of “pushing”)
any presidential candidate, we]
hope that they will poin us in in
creasing the effectiveness of stu-1
dent government by increasing j
the number of students it effec
tively and willingly represents. I
Who will Stern vote for? It will 1
be the candidate who makes the]
most determined effort to bring
the issues to us and to seriously I
campaign for our vote.

After reading the April 14th
issue of “the Peninsula’s only 1
morning newspaper” I feel that
a closer examination of the Stern-
Toyon voting issue is desired
since the Executive Session of
LASSU was successfully exposed.
No reference was made or will be
made by me. that Jim McGee has
or will get “control” of the Stern-
Toyon vote. However, when the
issue was presented to me, I was
aware of the fact that in this elec
tion we have one independent can
didate running as opposed to five
Row men. Whether Jim McGee
will try to split University unity
by vying the independents against
the Row, is a question only time
will answer. I sincerely hope that
the best man will be selected on
his own merits and that “politics,”
such as mentioned above will not
present itself in this campaign.
When discussing, with Miss
Elna Rodenhouse, the issue of
special voting booths in Stern-
Toyon-ICC areas, she mentioned
that an independent group had ap
proached her and volunteered to
supply boxes, locks for those vot
ing boxes, and staffs to man six
booths in Stern and one each in
Toyon and the ICC area. I compli
ment the independent representa
tives for their sincere interest “to
get out the vote,” but I question
why should special booths be set
up only in this independent resi
dent area. If the Elections Com
mittee feels favorable to the ad
ditions of these booths. I then
challenge them to set up similar
facilities in all dorms and living
groups on campus.

Height of Stupidity
Your tenure on The Daily staff
has been marked by a series of
article and headlines which can
only be termed yellow journalism.
Sensationalism has been your by
word, especially since you have
been Editor of The Daily. How
ever, the publishing on the front
page of Friday’s Daily of infor
mation you gained directly from a
secret executive session of the
Legislature, which was convened
for the specific purpose of keep
ing the information aired out of
The Daily because it might have
been injurious to several candi
dates and private individuals, has
placed you at a new height of ir
responsibility and stupidity.
First of all, you violated a trust
as an ex-officio member of Legis
lature by divulging information
you heard at an executive ses
sion. Secondly, as a member of
the press, you violated the trust
placed in you by the Legislature
by printing information which
was clearly stated to you as being
off the record. And if you would
claim that you were not the Leg
islature member who told the
Managing Editor, Mr. Rankin,
what happened during the execu
tive session, then as editor and
member of the Legislature who
had been present during that ses
sion, you violated a trust by not
striking that information from
the story which your managing
editor sought to have printed.
Your desire to publish sensa
tional stories is understandable;
yet, you have overstepped the
bounds of decency and good taste
by printing sensational material
without regard to whom it in
jured, apparently because it sat
isfied your personal whims. The
lengths to which you went in Fri
day’s Daily marks you as a man
unworthy of our personal trust or
the trust of the Legislature. You
seem unable to exercise any de
gree of self-restraint or to recog
nize the responsibility you pos
sess as editor of The Daily and
as a member of the Legislature.
The blame is solely yours; how
ever, we doubt that you have the
integrity to admit your wrong
doing.

(Editor’s Note; The Daily was
not only perfectly within the
ethics of good journalism by
printing the “leaked” news as it
is an accepted custom at all levels
of government, but also believed
in the student body's right-to-know
what their elected and appointed
servants said.)
No Spirit Loss

It is indeed unfortunate that we
as freshman are not running the
usual last-minute plethora of can
didates for class office. This, how
ever, does not necessarily imply
a lack of interest, but instead a
lack of information. Prior to the
closing of nominations last Tues
day, less then 10 lines had been de
voted to class government in The
Daily, and, in addition, a hectic
Rush Week precluded much of
the usual political activity.
Moreover, the mere fact that
many of the able and active mem
bers of our class are not running
for office by no means indicates
a lack of interest in class govern
ment. Indeed, many of these peo
ple have expressed a desire to
work in a strong class organiza
tion and have already given a
great deal of thought to the ques
tion.
Class government is a contro
versial issue. Many people feel
that it is unnecessary except as a
social committee din ing the soph
omore and junior years. It should
be one of the functions of next
year’s organization to examine to
the fullest extent possible the po
tentialities of class government
and to submit, at the end of the
year, recommendations concern
ing either its justification or its
abolition. These potentialities can
be explored through the innova
tions of class meetings, straw
votes, and surveys. The Executive
Committee can also be revitalized
by making it a group of commit
tee chairmen and class represent

Stanford’s student government

An Assassination
It is blatant enough to print a
charge made to a secret, executive
session of legislature. But the of
fense is doubly compounded when
such a ridiculous charge has
never been made by me, when it
has been categorically denied to
the Editor of The Daily, and when
the editor did not even print the
denial.
By associating me with a
charge that the Toyon-Stern vote
is “controlled” by a specific can
didate, a patently absurd charge
I never made, the Editor of The
Daily has been guilty of yellow

journalism, the results of which
border on character assassination.

An unfortunate misunderstand
ing has resulted in LASSU’s de
cision, as reported in Friday’s
Daily, to bar the proposed polling
places in Stern and Toyon. The j
controversy was originated by a |
few individuals who feared that j
the polling places were part of a
scheme to push one candidate for j
ASSU President. This is com- j
pletely false! The real purpose is |
to place at the disposal of all]
candidates 200-300 new voles. We I
feel that the best way to start
combating the apathy in student 1
government, which many of the i
candidates are concerned with, is j
to bring to the students the op-1
portunity to vole, thereby inter
esting some of those who have]
never voted before to go out and [
vote again in the next election,'
These new votes would also bring j
more candidates to Stern for per- j
sonal campaigning, which in it-1
self would increase interest.
It seems apparent that some]
people are afraid of the pow'er of ]
the Stern voters. However, we are [
sure that they are as interested j
as we are in increasing the in- j
terest and participation of the en
tire student body in student elec
tions. With the realization that we
have no intention of “pushing”)
any presidential candidate, we]
hope that they will poin us in in
creasing the effectiveness of stu-1
dent government by increasing j
the number of students it effec
tively and willingly represents. I
Who will Stern vote for? It will 1
be the candidate who makes the]
most determined effort to bring
the issues to us and to seriously I
campaign for our vote.

After reading the April 14th
issue of “the Peninsula’s only 1
morning newspaper” I feel that
a closer examination of the Stern-
Toyon voting issue is desired
since the Executive Session of
LASSU was successfully exposed.
No reference was made or will be
made by me. that Jim McGee has
or will get “control” of the Stern-
Toyon vote. However, when the
issue was presented to me, I was
aware of the fact that in this elec
tion we have one independent can
didate running as opposed to five
Row men. Whether Jim McGee
will try to split University unity
by vying the independents against
the Row, is a question only time
will answer. I sincerely hope that
the best man will be selected on
his own merits and that “politics,”
such as mentioned above will not
present itself in this campaign.
When discussing, with Miss
Elna Rodenhouse, the issue of
special voting booths in Stern-
Toyon-ICC areas, she mentioned
that an independent group had ap
proached her and volunteered to
supply boxes, locks for those vot
ing boxes, and staffs to man six
booths in Stern and one each in
Toyon and the ICC area. I compli
ment the independent representa
tives for their sincere interest “to
get out the vote,” but I question
why should special booths be set
up only in this independent resi
dent area. If the Elections Com
mittee feels favorable to the ad
ditions of these booths. I then
challenge them to set up similar
facilities in all dorms and living
groups on campus.

Height of Stupidity
Your tenure on The Daily staff
has been marked by a series of
article and headlines which can
only be termed yellow journalism.
Sensationalism has been your by
word, especially since you have
been Editor of The Daily. How
ever, the publishing on the front
page of Friday’s Daily of infor
mation you gained directly from a
secret executive session of the
Legislature, which was convened
for the specific purpose of keep
ing the information aired out of
The Daily because it might have
been injurious to several candi
dates and private individuals, has
placed you at a new height of ir
responsibility and stupidity.
First of all, you violated a trust
as an ex-officio member of Legis
lature by divulging information
you heard at an executive ses
sion. Secondly, as a member of
the press, you violated the trust
placed in you by the Legislature
by printing information which
was clearly stated to you as being
off the record. And if you would
claim that you were not the Leg
islature member who told the
Managing Editor, Mr. Rankin,
what happened during the execu
tive session, then as editor and
member of the Legislature who
had been present during that ses
sion, you violated a trust by not
striking that information from
the story which your managing
editor sought to have printed.
Your desire to publish sensa
tional stories is understandable;
yet, you have overstepped the
bounds of decency and good taste
by printing sensational material
without regard to whom it in
jured, apparently because it sat
isfied your personal whims. The
lengths to which you went in Fri
day’s Daily marks you as a man
unworthy of our personal trust or
the trust of the Legislature. You
seem unable to exercise any de
gree of self-restraint or to recog
nize the responsibility you pos
sess as editor of The Daily and
as a member of the Legislature.
The blame is solely yours; how
ever, we doubt that you have the
integrity to admit your wrong
doing.

(Editor’s Note; The Daily was
not only perfectly within the
ethics of good journalism by
printing the “leaked” news as it
is an accepted custom at all levels
of government, but also believed
in the student body's right-to-know
what their elected and appointed
servants said.)
No Spirit Loss

It is indeed unfortunate that we
as freshman are not running the
usual last-minute plethora of can
didates for class office. This, how
ever, does not necessarily imply
a lack of interest, but instead a
lack of information. Prior to the
closing of nominations last Tues
day, less then 10 lines had been de
voted to class government in The
Daily, and, in addition, a hectic
Rush Week precluded much of
the usual political activity.
Moreover, the mere fact that
many of the able and active mem
bers of our class are not running
for office by no means indicates
a lack of interest in class govern
ment. Indeed, many of these peo
ple have expressed a desire to
work in a strong class organiza
tion and have already given a
great deal of thought to the ques
tion.
Class government is a contro
versial issue. Many people feel
that it is unnecessary except as a
social committee din ing the soph
omore and junior years. It should
be one of the functions of next
year’s organization to examine to
the fullest extent possible the po
tentialities of class government
and to submit, at the end of the
year, recommendations concern
ing either its justification or its
abolition. These potentialities can
be explored through the innova
tions of class meetings, straw
votes, and surveys. The Executive
Committee can also be revitalized
by making it a group of commit
tee chairmen and class represent
atives from various campus ac
tivities implementing policy
passed by the class as a whole
which may range from freshman
orientation to academic improve
ments.
It is difficult to see how The
Daily concluded that “it is fairly
clear that no new ideas will be
presented for running a class gov
ernment.” There are many people
with many ideas in our class; it
is not one person, but the entire
class whose ideas will give next
year’s government its direction.
The portion of my statement
which The Daily quoted out of
context in Friday’s editorial was
not by any means a platform nor
was it intended to be such. Within
the limit of 100 words, I decided
instead to relate a general state
ment of ideal, whose implications
evidently were not fully under
stood. A limitation of 100 words
does not lend itself to specifics.
Government, just as spirit, is
more than a matter of words. Our
class has not lost its spirit nor
does it intend to do so. With direct
expression of the class’ opinion
and a dedicated, imaginative Ex
ecutive Committee, I feel sure
that w’e can make class govern
ment an effective tool for im

An unfortunate misunderstand
ing has resulted in LASSU’s de
cision, as reported in Friday’s
Daily, to bar the proposed polling
places in Stern and Toyon. The j
controversy was originated by a |
few individuals who feared that j
the polling places were part of a
scheme to push one candidate for j
ASSU President. This is com- j
pletely false! The real purpose is |
to place at the disposal of all]
candidates 200-300 new voles. We I
feel that the best way to start
combating the apathy in student 1
government, which many of the i
candidates are concerned with, is j
to bring to the students the op-1
portunity to vole, thereby inter
esting some of those who have]
never voted before to go out and [
vote again in the next election,'
These new votes would also bring j
more candidates to Stern for per- j
sonal campaigning, which in it-1
self would increase interest.
It seems apparent that some]
people are afraid of the pow'er of ]
the Stern voters. However, we are [
sure that they are as interested j
as we are in increasing the in- j
terest and participation of the en
tire student body in student elec
tions. With the realization that we
have no intention of “pushing”)
any presidential candidate, we]
hope that they will poin us in in
creasing the effectiveness of stu-1
dent government by increasing j
the number of students it effec
tively and willingly represents. I
Who will Stern vote for? It will 1
be the candidate who makes the]
most determined effort to bring
the issues to us and to seriously I
campaign for our vote.

After reading the April 14th
issue of “the Peninsula’s only 1
morning newspaper” I feel that
a closer examination of the Stern-
Toyon voting issue is desired
since the Executive Session of
LASSU was successfully exposed.
No reference was made or will be
made by me. that Jim McGee has
or will get “control” of the Stern-
Toyon vote. However, when the
issue was presented to me, I was
aware of the fact that in this elec
tion we have one independent can
didate running as opposed to five
Row men. Whether Jim McGee
will try to split University unity
by vying the independents against
the Row, is a question only time
will answer. I sincerely hope that
the best man will be selected on
his own merits and that “politics,”
such as mentioned above will not
present itself in this campaign.
When discussing, with Miss
Elna Rodenhouse, the issue of
special voting booths in Stern-
Toyon-ICC areas, she mentioned
that an independent group had ap
proached her and volunteered to
supply boxes, locks for those vot
ing boxes, and staffs to man six
booths in Stern and one each in
Toyon and the ICC area. I compli
ment the independent representa
tives for their sincere interest “to
get out the vote,” but I question
why should special booths be set
up only in this independent resi
dent area. If the Elections Com
mittee feels favorable to the ad
ditions of these booths. I then
challenge them to set up similar
facilities in all dorms and living
groups on campus.

Height of Stupidity
Your tenure on The Daily staff
has been marked by a series of
article and headlines which can
only be termed yellow journalism.
Sensationalism has been your by
word, especially since you have
been Editor of The Daily. How
ever, the publishing on the front
page of Friday’s Daily of infor
mation you gained directly from a
secret executive session of the
Legislature, which was convened
for the specific purpose of keep
ing the information aired out of
The Daily because it might have
been injurious to several candi
dates and private individuals, has
placed you at a new height of ir
responsibility and stupidity.
First of all, you violated a trust
as an ex-officio member of Legis
lature by divulging information
you heard at an executive ses
sion. Secondly, as a member of
the press, you violated the trust
placed in you by the Legislature
by printing information which
was clearly stated to you as being
off the record. And if you would
claim that you were not the Leg
islature member who told the
Managing Editor, Mr. Rankin,
what happened during the execu
tive session, then as editor and
member of the Legislature who
had been present during that ses
sion, you violated a trust by not
striking that information from
the story which your managing
editor sought to have printed.
Your desire to publish sensa
tional stories is understandable;
yet, you have overstepped the
bounds of decency and good taste
by printing sensational material
without regard to whom it in
jured, apparently because it sat
isfied your personal whims. The
lengths to which you went in Fri
day’s Daily marks you as a man
unworthy of our personal trust or
the trust of the Legislature. You
seem unable to exercise any de
gree of self-restraint or to recog
nize the responsibility you pos
sess as editor of The Daily and
as a member of the Legislature.
The blame is solely yours; how
ever, we doubt that you have the
integrity to admit your wrong
doing.

(Editor’s Note; The Daily was
not only perfectly within the
ethics of good journalism by
printing the “leaked” news as it
is an accepted custom at all levels
of government, but also believed
in the student body's right-to-know
what their elected and appointed
servants said.)
No Spirit Loss

It is indeed unfortunate that we
as freshman are not running the
usual last-minute plethora of can
didates for class office. This, how
ever, does not necessarily imply
a lack of interest, but instead a
lack of information. Prior to the
closing of nominations last Tues
day, less then 10 lines had been de
voted to class government in The
Daily, and, in addition, a hectic
Rush Week precluded much of
the usual political activity.
Moreover, the mere fact that
many of the able and active mem
bers of our class are not running
for office by no means indicates
a lack of interest in class govern
ment. Indeed, many of these peo
ple have expressed a desire to
work in a strong class organiza
tion and have already given a
great deal of thought to the ques
tion.
Class government is a contro
versial issue. Many people feel
that it is unnecessary except as a
social committee din ing the soph
omore and junior years. It should
be one of the functions of next
year’s organization to examine to
the fullest extent possible the po
tentialities of class government
and to submit, at the end of the
year, recommendations concern
ing either its justification or its
abolition. These potentialities can
be explored through the innova
tions of class meetings, straw
votes, and surveys. The Executive
Committee can also be revitalized
by making it a group of commit
tee chairmen and class represent
atives from various campus ac
tivities implementing policy
passed by the class as a whole
which may range from freshman
orientation to academic improve
ments.
It is difficult to see how The
Daily concluded that “it is fairly
clear that no new ideas will be
presented for running a class gov
ernment.” There are many people
with many ideas in our class; it
is not one person, but the entire
class whose ideas will give next
year’s government its direction.
The portion of my statement
which The Daily quoted out of
context in Friday’s editorial was
not by any means a platform nor
was it intended to be such. Within
the limit of 100 words, I decided
instead to relate a general state
ment of ideal, whose implications
evidently were not fully under
stood. A limitation of 100 words
does not lend itself to specifics.
Government, just as spirit, is
more than a matter of words. Our
class has not lost its spirit nor
does it intend to do so. With direct
expression of the class’ opinion
and a dedicated, imaginative Ex
ecutive Committee, I feel sure
that w’e can make class govern
ment an effective tool for im
provement.

Stanford’s student government
can Ih* and should he an essential
part of the school's character. At
the present, however, the student
government is ineffectual be
cause it does not adequately rep
resent the students; one of the
most glaring deficiencies is (h
complete lack of regard for the
sophomore class. Since it is im
possible for the sophomore class
to elect any representatives to
either LASSU or Men's Council,
it will be the goal of the sopho
more class government to repre

ly promote tlie* best of their in
terests.

An Assassination
It is blatant enough to print a
charge made to a secret, executive
session of legislature. But the of
fense is doubly compounded when
such a ridiculous charge has
never been made by me, when it
has been categorically denied to
the Editor of The Daily, and when
the editor did not even print the
denial.

After reading the April 14th
issue of “the Peninsula’s only 1
morning newspaper” I feel that
a closer examination of the Stern-
Toyon voting issue is desired
since the Executive Session of
LASSU was successfully exposed.
No reference was made or will be
made by me. that Jim McGee has
or will get “control” of the Stern-
Toyon vote. However, when the
issue was presented to me, I was
aware of the fact that in this elec
tion we have one independent can
didate running as opposed to five
Row men. Whether Jim McGee
will try to split University unity
by vying the independents against
the Row, is a question only time
will answer. I sincerely hope that
the best man will be selected on
his own merits and that “politics,”
such as mentioned above will not
present itself in this campaign.
When discussing, with Miss
Elna Rodenhouse, the issue of
special voting booths in Stern-
Toyon-ICC areas, she mentioned
that an independent group had ap
proached her and volunteered to
supply boxes, locks for those vot
ing boxes, and staffs to man six
booths in Stern and one each in
Toyon and the ICC area. I compli
ment the independent representa
tives for their sincere interest “to
get out the vote,” but I question
why should special booths be set
up only in this independent resi
dent area. If the Elections Com
mittee feels favorable to the ad
ditions of these booths. I then
challenge them to set up similar
facilities in all dorms and living
groups on campus.

Height of Stupidity
Your tenure on The Daily staff
has been marked by a series of
article and headlines which can
only be termed yellow journalism.
Sensationalism has been your by
word, especially since you have
been Editor of The Daily. How
ever, the publishing on the front
page of Friday’s Daily of infor
mation you gained directly from a
secret executive session of the
Legislature, which was convened
for the specific purpose of keep
ing the information aired out of
The Daily because it might have
been injurious to several candi
dates and private individuals, has
placed you at a new height of ir
responsibility and stupidity.
First of all, you violated a trust
as an ex-officio member of Legis
lature by divulging information
you heard at an executive ses
sion. Secondly, as a member of
the press, you violated the trust
placed in you by the Legislature
by printing information which
was clearly stated to you as being
off the record. And if you would
claim that you were not the Leg
islature member who told the
Managing Editor, Mr. Rankin,
what happened during the execu
tive session, then as editor and
member of the Legislature who
had been present during that ses
sion, you violated a trust by not
striking that information from
the story which your managing
editor sought to have printed.
Your desire to publish sensa
tional stories is understandable;
yet, you have overstepped the
bounds of decency and good taste
by printing sensational material
without regard to whom it in
jured, apparently because it sat
isfied your personal whims. The
lengths to which you went in Fri
day’s Daily marks you as a man
unworthy of our personal trust or
the trust of the Legislature. You
seem unable to exercise any de
gree of self-restraint or to recog
nize the responsibility you pos
sess as editor of The Daily and
as a member of the Legislature.
The blame is solely yours; how
ever, we doubt that you have the
integrity to admit your wrong
doing.

(Editor’s Note; The Daily was
not only perfectly within the
ethics of good journalism by
printing the “leaked” news as it
is an accepted custom at all levels
of government, but also believed
in the student body's right-to-know
what their elected and appointed
servants said.)
No Spirit Loss

It is indeed unfortunate that we
as freshman are not running the
usual last-minute plethora of can
didates for class office. This, how
ever, does not necessarily imply
a lack of interest, but instead a
lack of information. Prior to the
closing of nominations last Tues
day, less then 10 lines had been de
voted to class government in The
Daily, and, in addition, a hectic
Rush Week precluded much of
the usual political activity.
Moreover, the mere fact that
many of the able and active mem
bers of our class are not running
for office by no means indicates
a lack of interest in class govern
ment. Indeed, many of these peo
ple have expressed a desire to
work in a strong class organiza
tion and have already given a
great deal of thought to the ques
tion.
Class government is a contro
versial issue. Many people feel
that it is unnecessary except as a
social committee din ing the soph
omore and junior years. It should
be one of the functions of next
year’s organization to examine to
the fullest extent possible the po
tentialities of class government
and to submit, at the end of the
year, recommendations concern
ing either its justification or its
abolition. These potentialities can
be explored through the innova
tions of class meetings, straw
votes, and surveys. The Executive
Committee can also be revitalized
by making it a group of commit
tee chairmen and class represent
atives from various campus ac
tivities implementing policy
passed by the class as a whole
which may range from freshman
orientation to academic improve
ments.
It is difficult to see how The
Daily concluded that “it is fairly
clear that no new ideas will be
presented for running a class gov
ernment.” There are many people
with many ideas in our class; it
is not one person, but the entire
class whose ideas will give next
year’s government its direction.
The portion of my statement
which The Daily quoted out of
context in Friday’s editorial was
not by any means a platform nor
was it intended to be such. Within
the limit of 100 words, I decided
instead to relate a general state
ment of ideal, whose implications
evidently were not fully under
stood. A limitation of 100 words
does not lend itself to specifics.
Government, just as spirit, is
more than a matter of words. Our
class has not lost its spirit nor
does it intend to do so. With direct
expression of the class’ opinion
and a dedicated, imaginative Ex
ecutive Committee, I feel sure
that w’e can make class govern
ment an effective tool for im
provement.

(Editor’s Note: For (he record,
here is McCarthy's complete state
ment to The Daily:)
Stanford’s student government
can Ih* and should he an essential
part of the school's character. At
the present, however, the student
government is ineffectual be
cause it does not adequately rep
resent the students; one of the
most glaring deficiencies is (h
complete lack of regard for the
sophomore class. Since it is im
possible for the sophomore class
to elect any representatives to
either LASSU or Men's Council,
it will be the goal of the sopho
more class government to repre

An Assassination
It is blatant enough to print a
charge made to a secret, executive
session of legislature. But the of
fense is doubly compounded when
such a ridiculous charge has
never been made by me, when it
has been categorically denied to
the Editor of The Daily, and when
the editor did not even print the
denial.
By associating me with a
charge that the Toyon-Stern vote
is “controlled” by a specific can
didate, a patently absurd charge
I never made, the Editor of The
Daily has been guilty of yellow

journalism, the results of which
border on character assassination.

An unfortunate misunderstand
ing has resulted in LASSU’s de
cision, as reported in Friday’s

places in Stern and Toyon. The j
controversy was originated by a |
few individuals who feared that j
the polling places were part of a
scheme to push one candidate for j
ASSU President. This is com- j
pletely false! The real purpose is |
to place at the disposal of all]
candidates 200-300 new voles. We I
feel that the best way to start
combating the apathy in student 1
government, which many of the i
candidates are concerned with, is j
to bring to the students the op-1
portunity to vole, thereby inter
esting some of those who have]
never voted before to go out and [
vote again in the next election,'
These new votes would also bring j
more candidates to Stern for per- j
sonal campaigning, which in it-1
self would increase interest.
It seems apparent that some]

since the Executive Session of
LASSU was successfully exposed.
No reference was made or will be
made by me. that Jim McGee has
or will get “control” of the Stern-
Toyon vote. However, when the
issue was presented to me, I was
aware of the fact that in this elec
tion we have one independent can
didate running as opposed to five
Row men. Whether Jim McGee
will try to split University unity
by vying the independents against
the Row, is a question only time
will answer. I sincerely hope that
the best man will be selected on
his own merits and that “politics,”
such as mentioned above will not
present itself in this campaign.
When discussing, with Miss
Elna Rodenhouse, the issue of
special voting booths in Stern-
Toyon-ICC areas, she mentioned
that an independent group had ap
proached her and volunteered to
supply boxes, locks for those vot
ing boxes, and staffs to man six
booths in Stern and one each in
Toyon and the ICC area. I compli
ment the independent representa
tives for their sincere interest “to
get out the vote,” but I question
why should special booths be set
up only in this independent resi
dent area. If the Elections Com
mittee feels favorable to the ad
ditions of these booths. I then
challenge them to set up similar
facilities in all dorms and living
groups on campus.

Height of Stupidity
Your tenure on The Daily staff
has been marked by a series of
article and headlines which can
only be termed yellow journalism.
Sensationalism has been your by
word, especially since you have
been Editor of The Daily. How
ever, the publishing on the front
page of Friday’s Daily of infor
mation you gained directly from a
secret executive session of the
Legislature, which was convened
for the specific purpose of keep
ing the information aired out of
The Daily because it might have
been injurious to several candi
dates and private individuals, has
placed you at a new height of ir
responsibility and stupidity.
First of all, you violated a trust
as an ex-officio member of Legis
lature by divulging information
you heard at an executive ses
sion. Secondly, as a member of
the press, you violated the trust
placed in you by the Legislature
by printing information which
was clearly stated to you as being
off the record. And if you would
claim that you were not the Leg
islature member who told the
Managing Editor, Mr. Rankin,
what happened during the execu
tive session, then as editor and
member of the Legislature who
had been present during that ses
sion, you violated a trust by not
striking that information from
the story which your managing
editor sought to have printed.
Your desire to publish sensa
tional stories is understandable;
yet, you have overstepped the
bounds of decency and good taste
by printing sensational material
without regard to whom it in
jured, apparently because it sat
isfied your personal whims. The
lengths to which you went in Fri
day’s Daily marks you as a man
unworthy of our personal trust or
the trust of the Legislature. You
seem unable to exercise any de
gree of self-restraint or to recog
nize the responsibility you pos
sess as editor of The Daily and
as a member of the Legislature.
The blame is solely yours; how
ever, we doubt that you have the
integrity to admit your wrong
doing.

(Editor’s Note; The Daily was
not only perfectly within the
ethics of good journalism by
printing the “leaked” news as it
is an accepted custom at all levels
of government, but also believed
in the student body's right-to-know
what their elected and appointed
servants said.)
