## Candidates Indicate Discontent With Gov't 
### BARRY GREENBERG Public Relations Assistant to the Student Body President 
What a blimey bunch of radi
cals! Perhaps all of t he ASSU pres
idential candidates should be in
vestigated. All indicate a discon
tent with Stanford’s student, gov
ernment and all propose to do
something about it “right quick”
if elected. There isn’t a “status
quo” man among them.
Lawrence Chlckering and Dave
Kelly are good examples. With
devastating moral indignation,
Chickering lashes out at several
of our venerable institutions and
states quite candidly how he will
change them. Kelly, perhaps not
quite so morally indignant, also
promises to shift several things
around.
ALTHOUGH they share several
ideas in common, Chickering and
Kelly disagree on a very funda
mental, if very moot, point. Kelly
claims that Stanford’s new intel
lectual challenge has been ac
cepted by the student body and is
being expressed in what he calls
“The New Enthusiasm.”
Chickering isn’t so optimistic.
“I am very concerned about the
inability of Stanford students to
articulate opinions on anything,”
he states in his platform. “The
lack of interest and knowledge of
current events is shocking . . .”
Kelly defends his views by point
ing to the “excited participation
in the discussion of the HU AC as
seen in the debate after the film”
and to the recent Sequoia success.
Although disagreeing as to the
intellectual activity of students,
both agree that student govern
ment is doing little to stimulate it.
Chickering proposes to create “a
huge student organization for the
purpose of stimulating student
opinion and enthusiasm for both
local and national issues.” Very
interesting and most, commend
able, but there is a rather serious
problem. Before you can have a
“huge” organization you must
have enough students who are in
terested in participating. Chicker
ing feels that too few students
are “articulating opinions on any
thing,” so it is difficult to de
termine where he is going to find

participants. But one wishes him
luck.

KELLY proposes to use the
1 Cabinet as a means to stimulate
■ the “New Enthusiasm.” The cab
inet, Kelly says, should he one
| of the key idea centers in student
policy “since its membership con
sists for the most part of the
leaders of those groups that are
most forceful in the “New En
thusiasm!" Cabinet does have the
potential, however, it is essential
to give it more legislative power
if if is to prove effictive.
One of Chickering’s more pro
vocative proposals is to take the
president off Legislature and to
appoint the administrative as
sistant chairman pro tempore of
LASSU. In this way the president
will avoid over-exposure and will
have more time to perform his
executive and initiative functions.
This is an excellent point. The
president supposedly knows more
about the issues and is also con
sidered responsible to a large de
gree for the actions of Legisla
ture. And yet he is unable under
; the present system to speak free
ly. It is difficult for him to re
! main an impartial chairman and
' also to champion vigorously some
cause.
THE PRESIDENT should be
made the floor leader, the initi
ator and defender of policy. His
stature as chief executive would
be considerably increased.
Other candidates have proposed
similar changes in the president’s
function which will be discussed
in ensuing columns. Candidates
who have not given this matter
serious consideration should do so
since one of the more glaring
weaknesses in the present system
is the “hamstrung president.”
