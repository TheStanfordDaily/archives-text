The Los Angeles Dodgers fired
a 14-hit barrage including three
homers yesterday to beat the
Pittsburgh Pirates, 13-6, fin a
game that was overshadowed by
a shin-kicking duel between Dodg
er Coach Leo Durocher and um
pire Jocko Conlan.
Durocher, the fiery tempered
former Dodger and New York
Giant manager who got back into
baseball this season after several
years on the sidelines, got into a
rhubarb with Conlan in the fourth
inning when the plate umpire
called a pop fly by Dodger first
baseman Norm Darker a foul.
IN HIS RAGE, Durocher kicked
the dirt at the plate umpire’s feet.
Conlan responded with a smart
kick to the right shin of Durocher.
Durocher counterkicked to Con
lan’s right shin. Other umpires
and Dodger players broke it up
and Durocher went to the showers
to cool off.
The Pirates looked like any
thing but world champions. Their
star pitcher, Vernon Law, who
opened up against the Dodgers,
lasted four and two-thirds in
nings, during which he gave up
eight hits and five runs. Law was
nicked for his second loss in two
starts this season.
Three Dodger homers were hit

by Tommy Davi.s, Wally Moon
and Norm Sherry. Sherry got his
in the eighth inning with the bags
loaded and it barely cleared the
left field screen, 251 feet from
home plate. The victim was Tom
Cheny, the fourth Pittsburgh
hurler, who had walked the first
three men he faced.
The San Francisco Giants took
over first place when they scored
a 5-2 victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies with the aid of a brilliant
ninth-inning relief performance
by Billy O’Dell. O'Dell look over
from winner Sam Jones with
three on and one out and got
pinch hitler Bobby Del Greco to
hit into a game-ending double
play. Willie McCovey led the
Giants’ 10-hit attack with three
singles.
