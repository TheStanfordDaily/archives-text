# SUNKEN DIAMOND DISASTER
## Cards Bow to CIBA Powers 
### ROY SCHMIDT 
Disaster reigned over the Sun
ken Diamond last weekend as the
Stanford Indians dropped a dou
bleheader to UCLA and a single
game to USC making their CIBA
record 0-5 and virtually ruining
their chances for the league title.
The Indians faltered before the
Trojans Friday, 3-2, and then
bowed to the Bruins 4-2 and 4-0 on

Saturday. The only bright spot of
the two days’ play was Lee Mo
eneh’s one-out triple in the seventh
inning of the second game Satur
day which broke up pitcher Ken
Bondee’s no-hitter
THE PLAY against UCLA was
marred by costly errors afield, and
lack of punch at the plate with
! men on base. In the opener Stan
ford outhit the Bruins 10-3, but
left 16 men stranded. Catcher
Scott O’Leary got all three safe
ties, including a long triple in the
seventh which scored the only
earned Bruin run.
Jim Smith went eight innings
for the Indians to absorb the loss,
his second of the year against four
wins. Smith did all he could to
beat himself, committing a costly
error in the first which later cost
him two runs and uncor king a wild
pitch in the fifth which set up an
other. Tom Sapp went all the way
to win for UCLA.
The aftermath was a thriller
with Stanford’s Marv Mecklenberg

OUT AT FIRST
Card right fielder Jim Cowart losing a race to first Saturday.
UCLA first basemen is Fadlo Mousalam.
Disaster reigned over the Sun
ken Diamond last weekend as the
Stanford Indians dropped a dou
bleheader to UCLA and a single
game to USC making their CIBA
record 0-5 and virtually ruining
their chances for the league title.
The Indians faltered before the
Trojans Friday, 3-2, and then
bowed to the Bruins 4-2 and 4-0 on

Saturday. The only bright spot of
the two days’ play was Lee Mo
eneh’s one-out triple in the seventh
inning of the second game Satur
day which broke up pitcher Ken
Bondee’s no-hitter
THE PLAY against UCLA was
marred by costly errors afield, and
lack of punch at the plate with
! men on base. In the opener Stan
ford outhit the Bruins 10-3, but
left 16 men stranded. Catcher
Scott O’Leary got all three safe
ties, including a long triple in the
seventh which scored the only
earned Bruin run.
Jim Smith went eight innings
for the Indians to absorb the loss,
his second of the year against four
wins. Smith did all he could to
beat himself, committing a costly
error in the first which later cost
him two runs and uncor king a wild
pitch in the fifth which set up an
other. Tom Sapp went all the way
to win for UCLA.
The aftermath was a thriller
with Stanford’s Marv Mecklenberg

OUT AT FIRST
Card right fielder Jim Cowart losing a race to first Saturday.
UCLA first basemen is Fadlo Mousalam.
Disaster reigned over the Sun
ken Diamond last weekend as the
Stanford Indians dropped a dou
bleheader to UCLA and a single
game to USC making their CIBA
record 0-5 and virtually ruining
their chances for the league title.
The Indians faltered before the
Trojans Friday, 3-2, and then
bowed to the Bruins 4-2 and 4-0 on

Saturday. The only bright spot of
the two days’ play was Lee Mo
eneh’s one-out triple in the seventh
inning of the second game Satur
day which broke up pitcher Ken
Bondee’s no-hitter
THE PLAY against UCLA was
marred by costly errors afield, and
lack of punch at the plate with
! men on base. In the opener Stan
ford outhit the Bruins 10-3, but
left 16 men stranded. Catcher
Scott O’Leary got all three safe
ties, including a long triple in the
seventh which scored the only
earned Bruin run.
Jim Smith went eight innings
for the Indians to absorb the loss,
his second of the year against four
wins. Smith did all he could to
beat himself, committing a costly
error in the first which later cost
him two runs and uncor king a wild
pitch in the fifth which set up an
other. Tom Sapp went all the way
to win for UCLA.
The aftermath was a thriller
with Stanford’s Marv Mecklenberg

OUT AT FIRST
Card right fielder Jim Cowart losing a race to first Saturday.
UCLA first basemen is Fadlo Mousalam.
Disaster reigned over the Sun
ken Diamond last weekend as the
Stanford Indians dropped a dou
bleheader to UCLA and a single
game to USC making their CIBA
record 0-5 and virtually ruining
their chances for the league title.
The Indians faltered before the
Trojans Friday, 3-2, and then
bowed to the Bruins 4-2 and 4-0 on

Saturday. The only bright spot of
the two days’ play was Lee Mo
eneh’s one-out triple in the seventh
inning of the second game Satur
day which broke up pitcher Ken
Bondee’s no-hitter
THE PLAY against UCLA was
marred by costly errors afield, and
lack of punch at the plate with
! men on base. In the opener Stan
ford outhit the Bruins 10-3, but
left 16 men stranded. Catcher
Scott O’Leary got all three safe
ties, including a long triple in the
seventh which scored the only
earned Bruin run.
Jim Smith went eight innings
for the Indians to absorb the loss,
his second of the year against four
wins. Smith did all he could to
beat himself, committing a costly
error in the first which later cost
him two runs and uncor king a wild
pitch in the fifth which set up an
other. Tom Sapp went all the way
to win for UCLA.
