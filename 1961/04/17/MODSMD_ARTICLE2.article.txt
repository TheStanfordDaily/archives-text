The brothers of Kappa Alpha came close to being homeless
yesterday when a fire threatened to sweep the house. A
mattress that had been pulled out on the roof by a sun
bather caught fire, presumably from a cigarette, according
to several KA members. Before it was discovered, the fire
burned a small hole in the roof. Stanford Fire Department
trucks were called out at 2:20 p.m., but the fire was nearly
out by the time they arrived. Fire Department Capt. Harry
Lund estimated damage to the roof at about $200.
