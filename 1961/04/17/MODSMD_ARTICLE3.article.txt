# PAULING, PANOFSKY
## Scientists Advocate World Disarmament 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
Dr. Linus Pauling callod for the
goal of general and complete
world disarmament as the only
rational solution of present world
problems, and Wolfgang Panof
sky said in nuclear test banning
“the problem is not one of goals,
but one of moans” at Saturday
morning and afternoon sessions
of the two-day “Challenge of the
Nuclear Ago” symposium on cam
pus.
Pauling, Nobel prize-winning
chemist from Cal Tech, called
such disarmament “eliminating
armament except as necessary for
world police action, with an im
proved system of international
law and cooperation so that prob
lems will be settled with princi
ples of law and justice to give the
maximum justice to all nations of
the world.”

PAULING ESTIMATED the
United States has twice as many
nuclear bombs as Russia has, but
Russia still has eight times the
number needed to kill every per
son in the United States.
He criticized views that the
United States should give up dis
armament talk, stockpile nuclear
weapons and use the threat of
destruction to impress its national
view on the rest of the world.
HE ALSO DISAGREED with
the opinion of a former AEC head
that we should “agree to eliminate
megaton weapons to make war

reasonable again and prepare to
settle disputes by limited wars.”
“I don’t believe ‘limited war’ is
rational; the United States and
Russia wouldn’t live up to agree
ments not to use megaton wea
pons,” Pauling maintained.
“I believe that the only policy
that is rational is working for
general and complete disarma
ment of all weapons down to po
lice level.”
JUST WHAT a “police level”
would include is not certain, Paul
ing said. “Probably some great
bombs would remain in existence
for world use; if all bombs were
destroyed, a dictator might be
able to manufacture some and
terrorize the world,” he said.
Ho said no one knows how to
solve the great problems of dis
armament mechanics because no
one has experience in the fields.
WE NEED to take one great
step and learn from that, Pauling
advocated. He disagreed with
Russia’s proposal to plan every
thing out ahead for complete dis
armament because, “I don’t think
we know enough to do that.”
He callod for a complete nuclear
test ban agreement to make it
harder for additional nations to
build nuclear weapon stockpiles
and to servo as good training
ground for coming to later agree
ments about disarmament.
Following that would be agree
ment to stop manufacturing nu
clear weapons and agreement to
stop manufacturing vehicles for
the delivery of weapons.
HE CONSIDERED 10 years an
optimistic estimate for reaching
this goal.
'‘We have to recognize that the
USSR isn’t our great enemy, and
we aren’t their great enemy; war
is our common enemy,” Pauling
concluded.

PANOFSKY, keynote speaker
of the afternoon session and direc
tor of the Stanford High Energy
Physics Laboratory, said the
United States must face a “bal
ance of risk” between the dangers
of inadequate control and the con
tinuation of the arms race.
The West’s desire for control
by inspection versus the Soviet
desire for secrecy is one obstacle
to a tost ban agreement, he said.
“There is no way to know whether
the control organization would in
crease or decrease the sources of
friction,” ho said.
Even if the “test bans are useful
only in the formulation of policy
and indicate methods of arms con
trol. they’ll he valuable,” Panof
sky noted.
