# Candidates Question ASSU President's Job
## Discussion of Issues Precedes Primary Vote 
### FRANCES FISHER Assistant Managing Editor 
Campaign issues filled the air
yesterday when the six presiden
tial candidates gathered at the
Daily Shack to discuss their plat
forms.

In the informal, cross-fire dis
cussion the principle issue was:
Should the ASSU president act as
chairman of Legislature or should
he be taken off Legislature, act
ing to initiate legislation rather
than to direct the discussion of it?
THIS IS one of the questions
the student body will need to de
cide before casting their votes in
the pr imary elections Wednesday
and Thursday.
In discussing the functions of
the ASSU president, candidates
Lawrie Chickering and Jim Mc-
Gee both advocated taking the
president off Legislature.
McGee stated, "A basic dilemma
exists under the present organiza
tion, for if the president expresses
his opinions, he is a poor presid
ing officer; while if he does not
express them, he is a poor presi
dent. Taking the president off
Legislature would solve this di
lemma, since he could then initi
ate legislation and express his
opinions readily.”

IN SUPPORT of the organiza
tional change, Chickering said
“The initiative function of the
president needs to be empha
sized. He should be allowed to
spend less time with protocol and
more with his cabinet working to
initiate legislation. With an ad
ministrative assistant running the
Legislature meetings, the presi
dent would be given this time.”
Countering McGee’s and Chick
ering’s arguments for the meas
ure, candidate Bob Sayler empha
sized that the president needs the
respect and power that he receives
through presiding over Legisla
ture. Sayler stated that the stu
dent body needs to see their presi
dent in action, which they are able
to do when he acts as presiding
officer of Legislature.
Candidate Dave Kelly, also in
favor of the presiding duties of
the president, pointed out “the
president is responsible to the
University and the world for the
actions of the Legislature, a re
sponsibility which he should not
have to shoulder if he is not head
of Legislature.”
BOTH Jim Shekoyan and Bob
Mathewson agreed that it is the
responsibility of the president to
lead the Legislature.
in the final analysis, then the
six candidates split four to two
on this issue with Chickering and
McGee advocating the removal of
the president from his position of
chairman of Legislature, and
Kelly, Mathewson, Sayler and
Shekoyan advocating the reten
tion of the president in these du
ties.

ISSUES concerning the lack of
sophomore representation on Leg
islature, the possibility of a for
eign student representative to
Legislature, the creation of an
Arts Coordination Board, and the
advantages and disadvantages of
making Judicial Council decisions
public were also discussed. For
the outcomes of the cross-fire dis
cussion, see tomorrow’s Daily.

Ted Striggles has announced as
a write-in candidate for sopho
more class president. Ann Hulsing
withdrew her candidacy for Wom
en’s Council.

According to a directive from
LASSU, all members of the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity are to

sentative. Miss Rodenhouse may

fice in the Union between 1 and 5
today and tomorrow.

At least six polls will be open
during the primary election, lo
cated at Engineering Corner, the
Post Office, Physics Lecture Hall,
Law School, Encina and the Li
brary.

UP TO six additional polls will
be open at Toyon, Stern and on
the Row depending on the avail
ability of people and equipment.
Stern men will run these polls
under the supervision of Legisla
ture members and/or faculty
members.

People are needed to supervise
the silk-screen poster-making pro
cess for election candidates. Per
sons interested in such supervi
sion should see Rupe Lissner at
Stern or visit the Art Board office
on the third floor of the Union.
Activity credit is offered for the

At noon today candidates for
ASSU president, vice president,

ing officer; while if he does not
express them, he is a poor presi
dent. Taking the president off
Legislature would solve this di
lemma, since he could then initi
ate legislation and express his
opinions readily.”

IN SUPPORT of the organiza
tional change, Chickering said
“The initiative function of the
president needs to be empha
sized. He should be allowed to
spend less time with protocol and
more with his cabinet working to
initiate legislation. With an ad
ministrative assistant running the
Legislature meetings, the presi
dent would be given this time.”
Countering McGee’s and Chick
ering’s arguments for the meas
ure, candidate Bob Sayler empha
sized that the president needs the
respect and power that he receives
through presiding over Legisla
ture. Sayler stated that the stu
dent body needs to see their presi
dent in action, which they are able
to do when he acts as presiding
officer of Legislature.
Candidate Dave Kelly, also in
favor of the presiding duties of
the president, pointed out “the
president is responsible to the
University and the world for the
actions of the Legislature, a re
sponsibility which he should not
have to shoulder if he is not head
of Legislature.”
BOTH Jim Shekoyan and Bob
Mathewson agreed that it is the
responsibility of the president to
lead the Legislature.
in the final analysis, then the
six candidates split four to two
on this issue with Chickering and
McGee advocating the removal of
the president from his position of
chairman of Legislature, and
Kelly, Mathewson, Sayler and
Shekoyan advocating the reten
tion of the president in these du
ties.

ISSUES concerning the lack of
sophomore representation on Leg
islature, the possibility of a for
eign student representative to
Legislature, the creation of an
Arts Coordination Board, and the
advantages and disadvantages of
making Judicial Council decisions
public were also discussed. For
the outcomes of the cross-fire dis
cussion, see tomorrow’s Daily.

Ted Striggles has announced as

Campaign issues filled the air
yesterday when the six presiden

Should the ASSU president act as

president is responsible to the

Mathewson agreed that it is the
responsibility of the president to
lead the Legislature.

Campaign issues filled the air
yesterday when the six presiden
tial candidates gathered at the
Daily Shack to discuss their plat
forms.

In the informal, cross-fire dis
cussion the principle issue was:
Should the ASSU president act as
chairman of Legislature or should
he be taken off Legislature, act
ing to initiate legislation rather
than to direct the discussion of it?
THIS IS one of the questions
the student body will need to de
cide before casting their votes in
the pr imary elections Wednesday
and Thursday.
In discussing the functions of
the ASSU president, candidates
Lawrie Chickering and Jim Mc-
Gee both advocated taking the
president off Legislature.
McGee stated, "A basic dilemma
exists under the present organiza
tion, for if the president expresses
his opinions, he is a poor presid
ing officer; while if he does not
express them, he is a poor presi
dent. Taking the president off
Legislature would solve this di
lemma, since he could then initi
ate legislation and express his
opinions readily.”

IN SUPPORT of the organiza
tional change, Chickering said
“The initiative function of the
president needs to be empha
sized. He should be allowed to
spend less time with protocol and
more with his cabinet working to
initiate legislation. With an ad
ministrative assistant running the
Legislature meetings, the presi
dent would be given this time.”
Countering McGee’s and Chick
ering’s arguments for the meas
ure, candidate Bob Sayler empha
sized that the president needs the
respect and power that he receives
through presiding over Legisla
ture. Sayler stated that the stu
dent body needs to see their presi
dent in action, which they are able
to do when he acts as presiding
officer of Legislature.
Candidate Dave Kelly, also in
favor of the presiding duties of
the president, pointed out “the
president is responsible to the
University and the world for the
actions of the Legislature, a re
sponsibility which he should not
have to shoulder if he is not head
