# New Post On Cabinet — Stassen
## 
### JUDY SKLAK 
In a plan for the “lifting” of
American foreign policy beyond
its customary confines of advanc
ing the interests of the United
States, Harold Stassen Saturday
night called for a new cabinet po
sition: that of Secretary for Hu
manity, whose top attention
would be to the “future of all
mankind.”

Stassen said that the Depart
ment of State with its top priority
to U.S. interests is outmoded in
this world of science, and that it
does not fit into the context of
this country’s moral and religious
beliefs.

THU NEW department would
have within it the ambassador to
the United Nations, all projects
for the assistance of underdevel
oped nations, and control, reduc
tion, and limitation of armaments.
The talk on “Government Or
ganization for Disarmament” cli
maxed a two-day symposium,
“The Challenge of the Nuclear
Age.” sponsored by the Focus sec
tion of Political Union.
Stassen, who has served as U.S.
representative to the United Na
tions Disarmament Commission
and presidential adviser on con
trol of nuclear weapons, empha
sized the need for someone to
take prime responsibility since
the problem of disarmament
transcends the scope of any now
existing department.
In a panel discussion following
the talk, Ithiel de Sola Pool noted
that Stassen’s Department of Hu
manity recognizes the need for
an act to symbolize government
policy, which can come only from
the very highest level and must
be consistent over a period of
time.
POOL fools that such a move
would be a challenge in that we
are able to formulate our aspira
tions for peace, we are requiring
the Soviets to match us.”
Stassen also asked that nations
move together for the develop
ment of natural resources, space,
communications, and health.

He pointed to the success of the
International Geophysical Year
and said that it is not true that
the U.S. could never work any
thing out with the Russians.
TAKING an initiative in, for ex
ample, the joint building of hydro
power plants would be a step to
ward “lifting” American foreign
policy and making its number one
object to facilitate the future of
all mankind.

The best hope is to stay away
from the extremes and work to
ward “inspected semi-disarma
ment” in “persisting and unend
ing negotiations.”
