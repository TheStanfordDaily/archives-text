Once upon a time
there lived a loan
shark who liked to
swim naturally. But
the law didn’t allow
and he was low on
green. Sharp fish
that he was, he
cruised down to R/A,
picked up a pair of
original outrigger
trunks and Super/
Charged it. Only
6.95, so if you want
to get in the swim
do the same, man.
