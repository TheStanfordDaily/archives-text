# Anti-Castro Rebels Making Headway

### United Press International 
Invading Cuban revolutionary forces battled Fidel Castro troops
in the swamplands 90 miles southeast of Havana yesterday and Cu
ban navy and air force units as well as deserting militiamen were
reported joining partisans in the fight to overthrow the Cuban
premier.
The Castro government naval observation station at Varadero

reported last night it sighted a
fleet of eight strange ships off
Cardenas, a north coast town 85
miles east of Havana. The sta
tion said it feared more invasion
landings.
Shortly before 10 p.m. last
night, the Castro controlled radio
announced to the people of Cuba
that the Cuban forces “continue
fighting heroically” against the
enemy in southeastern Las Villas
Province.
“In the next hours, there will be
new details to report to the peo
ple of the successes obtained by
the army . . .” the broadcast said.
A top exile spokesman late last
night said these were the day's
major developments:
• The heaviest fighting was in
the Cochinos Bay landing area of
southern Cuba and caused heavy
Castro casualties. He estimated
100 Castro militiamen killed alone
in the town of Jaguey Grande, 20
miles inland.

• The Cuban destroyer escort
Baire, a former U.S. Navy vessel,
sank at its dock at the Isle of
Pines, either scuttled by its crew
or sunk by saboteurs.
• Shooting was reported from
windows in some Havana suburbs.
• A tremendous explosion rock
ed the city of Cienfuegos in Las
Villas Province in the center of
the island. The Cienfuegos air
port was cordoned off by militia.
DIKKCTORS of the invasion
said the critical battle was ap
proaching.
At the United Nations in New
York, Cuba charged U.S. military
forces from the U.S. naval base
at Guantanamo had invaded Cuba.
The United States immediately
branded this a lie.
U.S. naval officials at Guantan
amo denied the base had anything
to do with the invasion. U.S.
forces there tightened defenses
against any Castro attack. U.S.
Marines, sailors and war dogs
took posts in the pill boxes and
along the 17-miie wire fence
shielding the base.
THE ANTI-CASTRO Revolu
tionary Council, directing the in
vasion which actually began Sat
urday night on the east coast, said
troops who dropped from pianos
and landed by sea yesterday at
Bahia de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs)
were advancing inland. That
drive was across the waist of cen
tral Cuba from the southern coast.
An estimated 5,000 men struck
from bases “in more than one La
tin American country,” according
to the council.
Navy segments were reported
deserting to the invaders. The
council said air force units had
joined the “liberating” forces.
A revolutionary council com
munique said militiamen from
Castro’s 300,000-man mobilized
militia force were deserting in
droves and the militia was “ever
dwindling.”
