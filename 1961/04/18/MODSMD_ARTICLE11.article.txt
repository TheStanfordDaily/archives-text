# Nominees Give ASSU Views
## 
### 
In the informal discussion at
The Daily Sunday, the six presi
dential nominees voiced opinions
on everything from the ASSU ex
ecutive position to the formation
of specific campus organizations.
All candidates expressed con
cern with the situation of the
sophomore class, which at present
goes unrepresented in Legislature
because of the transient nature of
the sophomores between living
quarters. As Bob Mathewson put
it, “No sophomore representation
results in discontinuous govern
ment.” He would solve this with
a representative-at-large, elected
by and responsible to the student
body.
LAWBIE Chickering would go
even further and have 10 repre
sentatives-at-large, but Jim Mc-
Gee insisted that the conception
of representative-at-large would
lend added stature to a member or
members of Legislature and with
out reason. He and Bob Sayler
offer instead a spring-fall election
overlap to include the sopho
mores.
Dave Kelly and Lawrie Chicker
ing took the lead in advocating a
student board or commission for
academic review. Both stressed
the desirability of setting up a
new organization for this func
tion, with Jim McGee advocating
in place of this that Legislature
handle it.
Concerning lack of executive
leadership, Bob Sayler would ini
tiate a “Brain Trust,” probably of
six members, four of whom would
come from the defeated presiden
tial candidates. He stated that this
would alleviate the present stran
gulation of administrative duties
surrounding the president.
McGEE FAVORED the publica
tion of Judicial Council decisions,
omitting names, Kelly disagreed,
stating that any frequent publi
cation of Council action would be
just as effective as publishing
names, and offered instead a quar
terly summary or appraisal, so
that names would not be inferred,
A formal platform for each
nominee will appear in tomor
row’s Daily.
Bob Garretson, candidate for
Class of ’62 President, has an
nounced his withdrawal from the
race.
