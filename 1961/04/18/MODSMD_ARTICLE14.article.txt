We do not believe that the government, at a national, state, or
local level, should conduct the people's business in secret. Re
cently, the Stanford Legislature has shown an unfortunate tendency
to attempt to go into executive session, barring not only the public,
but also the public's representative, the press. Last Thursday night
those who like to do business in private finally gathered enough
votes and the Legislature went into a closed-door session. The
Daily, feeling its obligation with the students, leaked and printed
the story.
This same type of situation at one time existed on the school
boards and city councils of many California cities. Here amateur
and unsophisticated politicians sensitive to criticism from public
and press held executive sessions as a means of keeping their
deliberations out of the public prints.
Responding to the cry of an alarmed public, Assemblyman Ralph
Brown from the San Joaquin Valley introduced a series of bills
beginning in 1953, which aimed at keeping the public's business
public. The philosophy of these acts state that "It is the intent of
the law that their legislative body actions be taken openly and that
their deliberations be conducted openly. The people of this State
do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.
The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public ser
vants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and
what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining
informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they
have created."

The bill then provides for public sessions at all times with closed
meetings legal only to discuss hiring, firing or hearing charges
against employes. The bill stipulates that special meetings of a
legislative body must be called 24 hours prior to the meeting with
a written agenda and notice going to representatives of both press
and radio. It further states that no other business shall be consid
ered by the legislative body except that which is on the agenda.
Since it is a private body, Stanford's Legislature does not come
under Brown's Law, However, the recent tendency of Legislature
towards closed-door proceedings makes us believe that either
a Brown's Law should be incorporated into the ASSU Constitution
as a protection to both press and public or the Legislators them
selves should have the courage to carry on the public's business
in public.

The bill then provides for public sessions at all times with closed
meetings legal only to discuss hiring, firing or hearing charges
against employes. The bill stipulates that special meetings of a
legislative body must be called 24 hours prior to the meeting with
a written agenda and notice going to representatives of both press
and radio. It further states that no other business shall be consid
ered by the legislative body except that which is on the agenda.
Since it is a private body, Stanford's Legislature does not come
under Brown's Law, However, the recent tendency of Legislature
towards closed-door proceedings makes us believe that either
a Brown's Law should be incorporated into the ASSU Constitution
as a protection to both press and public or the Legislators them
selves should have the courage to carry on the public's business
in public.
Freedom trom all obligation except that ot lidelity to the public interest
is vital.

The classic function of the aggressive reporter and editor—-a part of the
responsibility they owe to the public—is to open doors with the power of
the press—pry them open, blow them open.

We do not believe that the government, at a national, state, or
local level, should conduct the people's business in secret. Re
cently, the Stanford Legislature has shown an unfortunate tendency
to attempt to go into executive session, barring not only the public,
but also the public's representative, the press. Last Thursday night
those who like to do business in private finally gathered enough
votes and the Legislature went into a closed-door session. The
Daily, feeling its obligation with the students, leaked and printed
the story.
This same type of situation at one time existed on the school
boards and city councils of many California cities. Here amateur
and unsophisticated politicians sensitive to criticism from public
and press held executive sessions as a means of keeping their
deliberations out of the public prints.
Responding to the cry of an alarmed public, Assemblyman Ralph
Brown from the San Joaquin Valley introduced a series of bills
beginning in 1953, which aimed at keeping the public's business
public. The philosophy of these acts state that "It is the intent of
the law that their legislative body actions be taken openly and that
their deliberations be conducted openly. The people of this State
do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.
The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public ser
vants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and
what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining
informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they
have created."
