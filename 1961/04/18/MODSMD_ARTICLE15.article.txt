## Saylor's Sure He's Man For President 
### 
BY BARRY GREENBERG
Public Relations Assistant to
the Student Body President
Robert Sayler is probably the
least equivocal of the candidates
who is running for student body
president. He is sure he is the
most qualified man for the job
and is sure that if elected his pro
gram will revitalize dying student
government.
No deprecation Is intended by
the above paragraph. A certain
amount of self-assuredness is a
good quality in any person who is
running for chief executive. Quite
an idealist to be playing the
rather realistic game of politics,
Sayler criticizes the methods by
which presidents have been
elected.
“IN EFFECT, the highest office
has been determined by a friendly
face, a smile, a pat on the back,
and a slightly off-color but good
joke. Yet this precisely what is
not needed,” Sayler says. He then
points out that a candidate should
be chosen "on a basis of consistent
service and various campus activi
ties” as well as “personal
strength, dedication, experience
and vigour.”
Sayler’s platform may not be
the best, but it is the longest. He
calls his proposals the "21 plus,”
commenting wittily that “Wilson
only needed 14 and God 10.” Most
of the “21 plus,” are of an incon
sequential nature as far as the
average voter is concerned, but
some need mention.
Sayler places great emphasis on
strengthening the Cabinet. Seems
as if Sayler and most of the can
didates are annoyed at Legisla
ture’s "do-nothingess” and right
fully so. The Cabinet should be
strengthened. Sayler would also

form a "Brain Trust” composed of
a handful of administrative as
sistants. This is an excellent pro
posal, although Sayler may find
he will have to settle for a
“Trust.”
SAYLER disagrees with Chick
ering and other candidates in re
gard to having the administrative
assistant chair the LASSU meet
ings. “Allowing the president to
only appear at LASSU meetings
to ‘lobby his ideas through it’ is
the surest way to the disunity and
distrust which we are trying to
avoid. The fear of presidential
‘overexposure’ is unfounded. We
need more exposure.” This is
highly unrealistic. As pointed out
in yesterday’s column, if the chief
executive is to prove effective, he
MUST be able to present his ideas
to Legislature and MUST be able
to defend them. He cannot if he
is chairman. Furthermore, there
is no earthly reason why disunity
and distrust should accrue from
this change.
Sayler’s other proposals are
good, however, and they deserve
close attention when they appear
in The Daily tomorrow.
ROBERT Mathewson is run
ning for president also. His motto
is to help stamp out negation,
“the recurring type which pro
poses nothing and stifles develop
ment.” This motto has probably
been used dozens of times and we
still have negation. Perhaps
Mathewson is strong enough to
stamp it out, or perhaps it would
be wiser to change his motto and
to hope for a little less. The other
candidates, although idealistic,
are not planning to work mira
cles..

promises of the two Jims: McGee
and Shekoyan.)

need more exposure.” This is
highly unrealistic. As pointed out
in yesterday’s column, if the chief
executive is to prove effective, he
MUST be able to present his ideas
to Legislature and MUST be able
to defend them. He cannot if he
is chairman. Furthermore, there
is no earthly reason why disunity

this change.

close attention when they appear

ROBERT Mathewson is run
ning for president also. His motto
is to help stamp out negation,
“the recurring type which pro
poses nothing and stifles develop
ment.” This motto has probably
been used dozens of times and we
still have negation. Perhaps
Mathewson is strong enough to
stamp it out, or perhaps it would
be wiser to change his motto and
to hope for a little less. The other
candidates, although idealistic,
are not planning to work mira

BY BARRY GREENBERG
Public Relations Assistant to
the Student Body President
Robert Sayler is probably the
least equivocal of the candidates
who is running for student body
president. He is sure he is the
most qualified man for the job
and is sure that if elected his pro
gram will revitalize dying student
government.
No deprecation Is intended by
the above paragraph. A certain
amount of self-assuredness is a
good quality in any person who is
running for chief executive. Quite
an idealist to be playing the
rather realistic game of politics,
Sayler criticizes the methods by
which presidents have been
elected.
“IN EFFECT, the highest office
has been determined by a friendly
face, a smile, a pat on the back,
and a slightly off-color but good
joke. Yet this precisely what is
not needed,” Sayler says. He then
points out that a candidate should
be chosen "on a basis of consistent
service and various campus activi
ties” as well as “personal
strength, dedication, experience
and vigour.”
Sayler’s platform may not be
the best, but it is the longest. He
calls his proposals the "21 plus,”
commenting wittily that “Wilson
only needed 14 and God 10.” Most
of the “21 plus,” are of an incon
sequential nature as far as the
average voter is concerned, but
some need mention.
Sayler places great emphasis on
strengthening the Cabinet. Seems
as if Sayler and most of the can
didates are annoyed at Legisla
ture’s "do-nothingess” and right
fully so. The Cabinet should be
strengthened. Sayler would also

form a "Brain Trust” composed of
a handful of administrative as
sistants. This is an excellent pro
posal, although Sayler may find
he will have to settle for a
“Trust.”
SAYLER disagrees with Chick
ering and other candidates in re
gard to having the administrative
assistant chair the LASSU meet
ings. “Allowing the president to
only appear at LASSU meetings
to ‘lobby his ideas through it’ is
the surest way to the disunity and
