A Challenge
Friday’s Daily editorial read,
“Frosh Class Fail to Run Candi
dates.” It pointed out that only
one candidate was running for
each of the offices of president
and vice president of 1964. The
reason alleged for this was a lack
of interest in class government on
the parts of the freshman, who
earlier in the year had led a re
vival of Stanford spirit.
While I cannot discount this
possible reason, I would like to
suggest another one which from
talking with my classmates seems
the one responsible. What I have
in mind is that hardly a small
fraction of the class was made
aware of the petition deadline and
election dales until The Daily's
article the day before the dead
line. I’m sure freshmen thought
campaigning would come later
in the quarter, at least giving the
frosh a chance to recuperate from
Rush Week. It is difficult for a
freshman, preoccupied with
where to pledge or join, to take
his thoughts from this and try to
plan a campaign for office in the
period of one day. If there are
those in The Daily, ASSU and
Election Com who are concerned
for elective sophomore student
positions, why don't they make
more of an effort to publicize elec
tions to the freshman class ear
lier. Had this been done, there
would now be a race going for
these offices.
Later on in the editorial The
Daily took a general statement of
the presidential candidate’s plat
form, called it “impotent” and
proceeded to state that “it is fair
ly clear no new ideas will be pre
sented for running a class gov
ernment,” This type of judgment
is about as fair as judging a
speech after hearing only the in
troduction. The Daily’s statement
of there being no new ideas is
completely inaccurate and does
not necessarily follow from a lack
of competition. I agree with The
Daily that effective write-in cam
paigns would be good, but pri
marily for the reason that it will
make it easier for the candidates
to present their ideas. If, how
ever, there are no write-in cam
paigns organized. I know both
John McCarthy and Sally Moran,
the two candidates in question,
and respect their ideas, capabili
ties, and incentive, I can assure
both Stanford and The Daily thait
the Class of 1964 could hardly be
in better hands.
While I feel The Daily has done
some disservice to our class, it has
offered us a challenge. It has
questioned our concern for class
government. The freshman can
accept this challenge by making
certain to vote for their class of
ficers in the coming campaign,
whether they have competition or
not.

Mixed Emotions
In regards to your editorial Fri
day, I have mixed emotions. It is
too bad that only one candidate
filed for president and vice presi
dent of the Class of 1964. This,
however, does not necessarily
mean that no interest exists. The
nominations took place during
Rush Week—which rivaled only
Pre-Reg Week for amount of con
fusion.
Another reason perhaps lies
with The Daily. Many freshmen
are still unfamiliar with the op
erations of student government.
Many freshmen do, however, read
The Daily’s sometimes construc
tive but more often irresponsible
criticism of student government.
This tends to discourage capable
persons from seeking office.
You state that no new ideas for
class government will be pre
sented because “there is no in
centive due to lack of competi
tion.” Not only is this an insult to
the people running but it shows

McConnell, treasurer; Margaret
Costello, committee of seven; Bev

that The Daily does not know
these candidates or their plat
forms. Fortunately John Mc-
Carthy is not the type of person
to ease up just because there is a
lack of competition. His campaign
activities this week illustrate this
fact.
It will be interesting to see, that
with this lack of interest, how
many freshmen vote compared to
the rest of the campus. I am sure
that our precentage will be higher.

Misunderstanding
As a candidate for the Legisla
ture from Stern Hall, I w-ould like
to correct a misinterpretation that
has come up concerning a pro
posal I made to "have the Legis
lature take stands on relevant na
tional and international ques
tions.” Apparently some people
are disregarding the word "rele
vant” and coming to the conclu
sion that I am advocating that the
Legislature concern itself with
the Laos siUiation, the national
debt, or the support of one of the
factions in the Congo. This could
not be further from the truth!
What I meant by the statement
was that I felt the Legislature
should feel free to comment on
those issues, and only those is
sues, which relate either to Stan
ford in particular or students in
general. Examples of this are the
Peace Corps (about which the
Legislature did pass a resolution)
and “Operation Abolition.” There
were some students, who at the
time, were opposed to the Legis
lature's taking a stand on the
Peace Corps. I supported this and
will continue to support similar
stands.
I hope this statement w-ill clear
up all misunderstanding. I might
add that I fail to see that my be
liefs, no matter what they are or
what they may be interpreted to
be, are deserving of the anony
mous terrorists activities that
have been employed against me
recently.

No Publicity
Concerning your editorial on
the failure of the freshman class
to post candidates for its offices,
I believe that a good number of
significant facts have been omit
ted. The main and most obvious
reason freshmen failed to show
more interest in the elections is
that the publicity about the elec
tions was unjustifiably absent.
With the exception of three brief
mentions of class elections in The
Daily during the week before the
filing deadline, no attempt was
made to acquaint the freshmen
with the election, its procedure
or its requirements. Certainly a
class office which holds potential
power and duties takes serious
consideration on a candidate’s

part, and Rush Weak is not an
ideal time to consider candidacy
or to organize a political machine.
From the numberof high and prep
school politicians in the freshman
class there is no doubt still a i
great deal of class political ambi-'
tion, which unfortunately was not
warned in advance of this elec
tion.
Mr. McCarthy’s platform, al
though general, certainly is in no
way impotent. The Daily over
looks the fact that John Mc-
Carthy, who knew about the elec-1
tion in advance, has new irleas
and a functioning organization al
ready formed to revamp the al
most useless office of class presi- !
dent. The lack of competition is
indeed unfortunate, but it is not
an unsurmountahle factor when
there is a challenge ahead such
as making something out of an !
impotent office.

Controls Vote?
This is what I thought I read in
Friday’s Daily: that the Stanford
student government first decided
that the vote of two dormitories
was likely to go to a particular
candidate for its presidency, and
that the group voted to deprive i
these two dormitories of the
chance to vote at all.
Is that really what I read? I
know nothing of the operation of
your politics but what I see in the !
papers. How did this man McGee j
get such absolute control over the |
voters of Toyon and Stern? Did
he promise them A’s and a coed
in each closet; or did "he threaten |
dire reprisals? What a marvelous
network and approach he must |
direct!
Assuming that he does (and
that I really did read what I
thought I read), 1 wonder if your
student Legislature also recom
mends the disenfranchisement of
all citizens of Cook County, 111,,
or better yet, those biased voters |
of the State of Georgia?
Did you report the story right? j
Did I read it wrong? Are we in |
the U.S.A.? Pinch me. !

Mouthwash
How riare Scotty Thompson, |
Steve Corker, and Edna Roden
house accuse Jirp McGee of “con
trolling” the Toyon-Stern vote! ! !
What they mean by control is
that he is liked by that group and
that it will thus vote largely for !
him. It escapes me how anyone |
could control any votes in any i
election on the Stanford campus. I
If Scotty and Steve would define
(ynd PROVEi their accusations,
I'm sure the entire student body i
would appreciate it. Otherwise, j
they need their mouths washed I
out with soap!
