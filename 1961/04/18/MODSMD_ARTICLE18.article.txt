# Tribe Hosts Spartans
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford plays host to the San
Jose State Spartans at Sunken
Diamond today at 3:15 in a non
conference baseball game.
Stanford hopes to bounce back
from three weekend defeats
against the Spartans. The Indians
have already downed San Jose
once this year, 3-1, under the
lights at San Jose, and hope to
make it two in a row today. San
Jose played Cal Poly this week
end. splitting a double header,
winning 16-0, and losing in seven
innings, 2-0,
STANFORD Conch Dutch reti
ring will give sophomore Darrell
Sutherland a chance at some
needed experience by starting the
fireballing right-hander. Suther
land has displayed good speed and
a wicked curve ball, but has been
troubled by control in making the
transition from basketball to base
ball. In innings, all in relief,
he has yet to give up a hit, but
has given up five runs, all
through walks, wild pitches and
hit batters.

Fehring has shaken up his line
up to squeeze some hits from bat
ters that were squeezed dry over
the weekend. There are still some
fine averages in the lineup,
among them Skip Lawrence’s
.368, John Hurlbut’s .318, and Hal
Schutzman’s .342.
Schutzman will lead off and
play in center field, to be followed
by Lee Moench at first base,
Lawrence in right field, Hurlbut
in left field. Bob Overman catch
ing, Rich Ferrazzano at third
base, Mike Magee at second, Joel
Shulman at shortstop, and Suther
land pitching.
