Leading the talented-loaded
Duck squad, which produced more
1960 Olympic Games entries than
any other team in the country, are
miler Dyrol Burleson, sprinters
Harry Jerome and Roscoe Cook
and half-miler Sig Ohlemann.
BESIDES Burleson, the Ameri
can 1500-meter record holder and
defending NCAA champion, the
Ducks boast steady George Lar
son (4:07.8), and a pair of fine
sophomores in Keith Forman
(4:08.6 indoors) and Vic Reeve
(4:11.0) in the mile. No matter
which three run, no team in the
country can stay with Oregon.
In the sprints there is more of
the same. Coach Bill Bowerman
believes that Jerome, Cook, Mike
Gaechter and Jim Puckett should
be able to match almost any
sprint entry.
JEROME and Cook share the
100-yard world record and Cook
also owns a part of the indoor
60-yard mark (6.0).
Jerome set his mark as a frosh
and then bowed out in the semi
finals of the Olympics with a
pulled muscle.
Gaechter has gone as well as
9.6 in the century and 21.3 over
220 yards and Puckett has
whipped to a 9.5 clocking chasing
Cook’s heels.
JUNIOR SIG Ohlemann, an
Olympic veteran who represented
Canada at Romo, leads the on
slaught in the 880. Stanford’s
Rich Klier will be in for the race
of his life for the lean Ohlemann
has flown the distance in 1:48.7.
Add to this the fact that Burleson
will double in the half and you
know the Ducks will be strong
over the middle distances. Burle
son has run a 1:50.0.
The Webfoots are not over
powering in the field events, but
still have some excellent per
formers.
Broad jump winner Jerry Close

is a lough competitor and his
best leap is 21-’i.
JERRY Stubblefield placed in
the NCAA last season as a soph
omore with a spin of 167-4 in (he
discus.
Phil Paquin H4-9) is improving
in the pole vault and Dave Steen,
a sophomore, is the best the Web
foots have ever had in the shot.
He has already thrown 53-6 in
doors.
