Peter Ustinov won the best sup

Miss Taylor, her life filled with
tragedy and a recent brush with
death, rose to the heights of her
career to win the Oscar for her
portrayal of a shady lady in “But
terfield 8.” It was her first award
after losing in three consecutive
nominations.
Lancaster was awarded the best

as the fire and brimstone minister
in “Elmer Gantry.”
“The Apartment” collected five
awards in all, and its director,
Billy Wilder, won the Oscar for
best direction.
Miss Taylor, assisted to the
stage by husband Eddie Fisher,
was on the verge of tears when
actor Yul Brynner presented her
with the award. She received a
tremendous ovation from the au
dience of more than 2,500.
