# Election Nears—-Students, Candidates Discuss Issues
## Question of Mixed Rooting Gets Comment 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
Should Stanford rooting sections
be integrated? This question be
came a campus issue when inte
gration was proposed as a solu
tion to the chaos in the men's sec
tion at the San Jose State game,
and, although the situation which
provoked it has since changed, it
will he decided in the election to
morrow and Thursday.
There docs not seem to be much
outspoken controversy over this
issue, but its presence on the bal
lot has produced a certain amount
of strong feeling, both pro and
con.
AWS President Sheila Mac Do
nald, who initiated the referendum
to combine the traditionally sepa
rated men's and women’s card
sections, states that the present
system is a sign of immaturity
and ‘'a silly state of affairs.” She
believes that there is a lack of
ways for people to got together
casually at Stanford, and that in
tegration of the rooting sections
would be a good way to help rem
edy this.
ASSU Veep Sandy McCarty
would also like to see the combi
nation of men’s and women’s sec
tions at the games as a step to
ward more all-campus integra
tion. She believes that such a
move w'ould not interfere with the
men’s sense of freedom, and that
Stanford women should be able
to accept whatever they might
hear at the games.
MAIN argument against inte
gration is that the men like the
status quo and enjoy the football
games more as an all-male affair.
Defending this view is Ed Cutter,
ASSU administrative assistant.
Cutter feels that this is a Stan
ford tradition worth keeping and
that there is a place for dates out
side the rooting section.

Yell leader Tim Laddish is defi
nitely against integration, espe
cially at this time. Laddish, who
concedes that it might be a chance
for more casual dating, says,
“There may come a time when it
would be necessary, but not in
the near future.” As a yell leader,
it is his opinion that integration
would not have any real effect on
spirit or conduct at the games.
The reaction of the alumni to
integration was questioned, but
Doan H. Donald Winbigler, who
himself has no strong personal
feeling either for or against inte
gration, stated that he believes as
long as the alumni can point to
sportsmanship and spirit in
“their” rooting section, they won’t
care whether or not the sections
are integrated. f i

provoked it has since changed, it

morrow and Thursday.
There docs not seem to be much
outspoken controversy over this
issue, but its presence on the bal
lot has produced a certain amount
of strong feeling, both pro and
con.
AWS President Sheila Mac Do
nald, who initiated the referendum
to combine the traditionally sepa
rated men's and women’s card
sections, states that the present
system is a sign of immaturity
and ‘'a silly state of affairs.” She
believes that there is a lack of
ways for people to got together
casually at Stanford, and that in
tegration of the rooting sections
would be a good way to help rem
edy this.
ASSU Veep Sandy McCarty
would also like to see the combi
nation of men’s and women’s sec
tions at the games as a step to
ward more all-campus integra
tion. She believes that such a
move w'ould not interfere with the
men’s sense of freedom, and that
Stanford women should be able
to accept whatever they might
hear at the games.
MAIN argument against inte
gration is that the men like the
status quo and enjoy the football
games more as an all-male affair.
Defending this view is Ed Cutter,
ASSU administrative assistant.
Cutter feels that this is a Stan

that there is a place for dates out

concedes that it might be a chance
for more casual dating, says,
“There may come a time when it
would be necessary, but not in
the near future.” As a yell leader,
it is his opinion that integration
would not have any real effect on
spirit or conduct at the games.
The reaction of the alumni to
integration was questioned, but
Doan H. Donald Winbigler, who
himself has no strong personal
feeling either for or against inte
gration, stated that he believes as
long as the alumni can point to
sportsmanship and spirit in
“their” rooting section, they won’t
care whether or not the sections
are integrated. f i
