# COOPERATIVE CAMPUS EFFORT
## Foreign Scholarships Explained 
### NORMA YOUNG 
The Stanford Foreign Scholarship Program is
a cooperative effort of the student government, the
independent campus living groups, and Ihe Uni
versity. Under this program, 10 outstanding stu
dents from abroad come to the campus each year.
Compared with other foreign student programs
across the country, Stanfordâ€™s emerges as unparal
leled in its scope and breadth of purpose. Many
other campuses host foreign students but none has
as all-encompassing and thorough a program as
that found here.
WESTERN EUROPE was originally the main
locale from which the scholars came. This trend
has changed until now the home countries of the
scholars lie in diverse global areas.
Financially the program is supported from five
different sources: the University, ASSU, HR, Cap
and Gown, and the living groups. Each partici
pating group provides some of the support neces
sary to make complete scholarships available to
j the foreign students involved. The awards provide
i travel expenses within the United States, room and
! board for one academic year, complete tuition, and
' vacation, books, and monthly allowances.

The scholars are all outstanding individuals.
They go through a rigorous screening process for
admission to the program. Many of them arc con
sidered by international student exchange insti
tutes as the top students in their respective
cou n tries.
SINCE THE PROGRAM emphasizes the benefit
which American students are expected to derive
from the presence of the foreign scholars on cam
pus, the most important demands on a scholar's
time, aside from academic responsibilities, come
from living groups and other student organizations
and activities.
In addition to their studies, the scholars are
expected to pursue a varied program of extra
curricular activities designed to broaden their
knowledge of the people and customs of this
nation.
Academic opportunity is not considered as 1 ho
prime aim of the program. Rather it is directed to
ward the mutual benefit of both the Stanford stu
dents and the scholars in (he belief that an inti
mate exchange of ideas among students of Stan
ford and those from universities abroad is one
good way to further world understanding.
