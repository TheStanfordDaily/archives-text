Question: What has 81 wheels, 39 seats, and no flies? Answer:
The 41 bicycles cluttering up Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis
back yard. These are the bicycles which Stanford policemen have

picked up during the last quarter.
If you have lost a bicycle, said
come around and check the bikes
at the Police Department .There's
a pretty good chance that yours
is there.

Chief Davis, it might pay you to

“THESE TWO. for example,”
the chief said, indicating a red
Indian and a black Raleigh
Sports, “were just lying around in
the bushes behind the Mathe
matics Department for half the
quarter.

“Our men left them alone,
thinking the owners might have
left them there; but finally one of
the secretaries called us and
asked us to take them away.”
The chief explained that the de
partment will pick up any bikes
it finds lying around that have not
been used for a while, or that are
found in a place where there aie
usually no bicycles.

THE BIKES are kept at the po
lice department for six months
after finding, in order that the
own may come and claim them.
There is no charge for this.
After the six months are up, the
bicycles are sold for the cost of
storage. “They then legitimately
belong to whoever buys them,”
Davis said. “But we’d much rather
see the original owners get them
back.”

It is very difficult, the chief ex
plained. to identify correctly any
bicycle that comes in in such a
manner as to bo able to find its
owner. “Sometimes a follow will
come in,” he said, “and describe a
lost bike. We look through all the
bikes we have, and never find it.
“THEN ONE day he comes in.
looks over the ones in back, and
says ‘There it is!’ And it doesn't
look at all like what he described.”
The 1 chief suggested that every
one who owns a bike write his
name and address on a gummed
label and put it on the upright bar
just below the seat. “That way it
won’t get rained on or got dirty,
and it will be a great help to us in
getting lost hikes back to (heir
owners.”
