INDIANS
Once upon a time
there lived an
Indian chick named
Pocahontas who was
warm for a captain
character who was
about to get the axe.
To save him she sent
him to R/A tor a
pair of handsewn
Walkover moccasin
slip-ons, only 1 5.88.
This and certain
other events saved
the day and some
cash we might add.
