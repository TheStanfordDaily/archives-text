TINY MEMORY UNIT
GUIDES GIANT ROCKETS
INTO SPACE
On this tiny drum, only four and one-half inches in diameter,
is recorded all the significant data needed to direct a rocket
into space.
As the rocket blasts skyward, the electronic computer, which
includes this small memory unit, begins to monitor the flight.
The computer continually correlates data on flight progress
with data in the memory unit and makes course corrections
instantly.
The very small size and weight of this memory unit is an
achievement in itself. Yet other difficult problems had to be
overcome â€”shock, prolonged vibration and extremely high G
forces. Only by using new materials and design techniques
were these problems solved.
People with backgrounds in the sciences, engineering, and
liberal arts all contributed to the success of this project. Ideas
which create new products can come from anywhere at IBM.
From research, development, programming, manufacturing,
marketing.
If you would like a job where your ideas can be put to work in
interesting and important areas, then you should consider
the many opportunities at IBM. The IBM representative will
be interviewing on your campus. He will be glad to discuss
career openings at IBM. Your placement officer can make an
appointment. Or you may write, outlining background and
interests, to: Director of Technical Recruitment, Dept. 897,
IBM Corporation, 590 Madison Avenue, New York 22, N. Y.
You naturally have a better chance to grow with a growth company. iom
