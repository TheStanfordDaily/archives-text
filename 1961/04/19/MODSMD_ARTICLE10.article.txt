# Dr. Gallagher Finds Tribute in His Work
## 
### 
The accidental death of Dr. Philip B. Gallagher, one of Stanford's
most prominent radio scientists, brought shock and sadness this
week to the academic community.
Dr. Gallagher, aged 33, was a respected and recognized leader
in his field. In April 1959 he helped achieve a major scientific
advance when he worked as co-director of a solar research project
which succeeded in bouncing a radar beam off the surface of the
sun.
A graduate from Santa Clara University with M.A. and Ph.D.
degrees from Stanford, Dr. Gallagher joined the staff of the Stan
ford Electronics Laboratory in 1951 as a research assistant. Since
that time, he participated in all of the important projects of the lab.
Among his many accomplishments, Dr. Gallagher will be re
membered as the co-discoverer of an unusual form of aurora visible
only to radar and occurring at low latitudes. He also pioneered
work in communications by means of radio echoes from meteor
trails. At the time of his death, he was on the verge of an impor
tant breakthrough in the understanding of a novel form of trans
mission of high frequency radio waves between the hemispheres.
His associates hope that this work can be carried on and feel that
his theory will be proved correct.
Said Dr. Oswald G. Villard, an associate and personal friend
of Dr. Gallagher, "His death leaves a terrible gap in our ranks.
He was of the highest professional calibre and standards and
showed the greatest devotion for his work. No sacrifice was too
great for him; very few people are so dedicated."
Dr. Gallagher will be remembered here at Stanford, by his
friends for the pleasure of having known and worked with him,
by academic circles at large for his important contributions to
scientific knowledge.
