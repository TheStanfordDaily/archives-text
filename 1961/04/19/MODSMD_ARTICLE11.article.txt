## McGee Wants Tough ASSU Administration 
### BARRY GREENBERG Public Relations Assistant to The Student Body President 
MeGEE’S THIRD point is to
make the Cabinet a directing
force. All the candidates are
agreed on this and it is a healthy
sign. Cabinet may prove to be an
oasis in the Sahara of student
government.
Apparently annoyed at student
goveyiment’s failure to follow
student sentiment on issues, Mc-
Gee says: “On many issues such
as the ATO business, the Peace
Corps, and the “Operation Aboli
tion” film, the prevalent student
sentiment here has been fairly
well defined.
In cases like this it is not only
important that we take steps to
see that our opinion is well-reg
istered, but also that we try to
take steps to spread our opinion
to other campuses.”
HE GOES on to say that the Pa
cific Student Body Presidents As
sociation can be well used for this
purpose. He is opposed to N.S.A.,
however.
You may recall that N.S.A. was
a big issue last year. McGee does
not say why he is against N.S.A.
This is unfortunate, but it doesn’t
matter—anyone who is serious
about being student body presi
dent wouldn’t DARE to back
N.S.A. on this campus. One won
ders why McGee even mentioned
it.
Jim Shekoyan is also a candi
date. One of his more promising
suggestions is to have a regular
survey of student opinion on stu
dent affairs for a greater student
voice in administration decisions.
There is one serious drawback.
Will the students care enough to
submit to such a survey? It would
surely be to their benefit to do so
since student government can
only prove effective, in spite of
all the candidates’ proposals and
promises, if the students want to
make it effective.

As you gaily wend your way to
the polls today, with your student
body card clutched in one hand
and my first two columns
clutched in the other, it would be
to your inestimable benefit to re
member the following pearls of
wisdom.
The discussion to date of the
ASSU presidential candidates has
brought to light one important
factor: all six candidates, al
though differing in means, funda
mentally agree that student gov
ernment must undergo a change
if it is to prove effective.
JIM McGEE has pledged to ac
tivate the ASSU in three ways.
First, he would introduce a tough
administration. This is fine, but
there is an inherent danger. A
"tough” administration may alien
ate several organizations unless
McGee can combine toughness
with diplomacy. There is, of
course, no reason to assume that
he can’t.
Second, McGee, like Chickening,
would separate the presidency
from LASSU. This particular
point has prove to be a decisive
factor. Bob Sayler, who is opposed
to this concept, believes that a
strong president could overcome
the problem of being chairman of
Legislature and being a strong
man on issues too.
McGee counters that the presi
dent “is the person who should as
sume . . . initiative and he cannot
do this and preside over the body
that is weighing his proposals.”
There is much to be said for both
sides on this matter, but this col
umnist favors the McGee-Chick
ering line. At any rate it wouldn’t
hurt to try their new approach
and if it doesn’t work, it would
he simple to revert to the old
method.

You may recall that N.S.A. was
a big issue last year. McGee does
not say why he is against N.S.A.
This is unfortunate, but it doesn’t
matter—anyone who is serious
about being student body presi
dent wouldn’t DARE to back
N.S.A. on this campus. One won
ders why McGee even mentioned
it.
Jim Shekoyan is also a candi
date. One of his more promising
suggestions is to have a regular
survey of student opinion on stu
dent affairs for a greater student
voice in administration decisions.
There is one serious drawback.
Will the students care enough to
submit to such a survey? It would
surely be to their benefit to do so
since student government can
only prove effective, in spite of
all the candidates’ proposals and
promises, if the students want to
make it effective.

As you gaily wend your way to
the polls today, with your student
body card clutched in one hand
and my first two columns
clutched in the other, it would be
to your inestimable benefit to re
member the following pearls of
wisdom.
The discussion to date of the
ASSU presidential candidates has
brought to light one important
factor: all six candidates, al
though differing in means, funda
mentally agree that student gov
ernment must undergo a change
if it is to prove effective.
JIM McGEE has pledged to ac
tivate the ASSU in three ways.
First, he would introduce a tough
administration. This is fine, but
there is an inherent danger. A
"tough” administration may alien
ate several organizations unless
McGee can combine toughness
with diplomacy. There is, of
course, no reason to assume that
he can’t.
Second, McGee, like Chickening,
would separate the presidency
from LASSU. This particular
point has prove to be a decisive
factor. Bob Sayler, who is opposed
to this concept, believes that a
strong president could overcome
the problem of being chairman of
Legislature and being a strong
man on issues too.
McGee counters that the presi
dent “is the person who should as
sume . . . initiative and he cannot
do this and preside over the body
that is weighing his proposals.”
There is much to be said for both
sides on this matter, but this col
umnist favors the McGee-Chick
ering line. At any rate it wouldn’t
hurt to try their new approach
and if it doesn’t work, it would
he simple to revert to the old
method.
MeGEE’S THIRD point is to
make the Cabinet a directing
force. All the candidates are
agreed on this and it is a healthy
sign. Cabinet may prove to be an
oasis in the Sahara of student
government.
Apparently annoyed at student
goveyiment’s failure to follow
student sentiment on issues, Mc-
Gee says: “On many issues such
as the ATO business, the Peace
Corps, and the “Operation Aboli
tion” film, the prevalent student
sentiment here has been fairly
well defined.
In cases like this it is not only
important that we take steps to
see that our opinion is well-reg
istered, but also that we try to
take steps to spread our opinion
to other campuses.”
HE GOES on to say that the Pa
cific Student Body Presidents As
sociation can be well used for this
purpose. He is opposed to N.S.A.,
however.
