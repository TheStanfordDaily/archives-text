# Students Plan Cuban Protest
## 
### 
A massive demonstration begin
ning with a rally in Union Square
today at 1 p.m. was planned Mon
day night by two large groups of
students from UC, San Francisco
State College, Hastings, and Stan
ford. The students met to pro
test the role of the Central Intel
ligence Agency and other govern
ment agencies in the invasion of
Cuba.

From Union Square a “funeral
procession” headed by bearers of
a large black coffin, is to march
in mass on the Federal Building.
“The coffin symbolizes the death
of morality in foreign policy,
American democratic procedures,
and thousands of Cuban nation
als,” according to a spokesman for
the committee.

A picket line is to be set up and
continued at least until Saturday
when another massive demonstra
tion is planned. Plans are also
being laid for a group of students
to engage today in a non violent
act of civil disobedience.
