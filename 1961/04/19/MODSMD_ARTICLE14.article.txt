BILL CALLISON
Stern Rep. to LASSU
I'm running for LASSU repre- ]
sentative on (he issue that domi
nated student elections last
spring: the question of whether
or not the LASSU should discuss
matters of national and interna
tional scope.
I think it should. If elected I
will pursue the local functions of
student government with vigi
lance, care, and imagination. But
I will also promote discussion of
important issues affecting the I
national and international com- !
munities.

The LASSU can discuss more
than bicycle lights. It can and
should expand Stanford’s hori
zons to rival those of America’s
other great universities whose
students speak directly to the
problems of the 20th century.

Stern Rep. to LASSU
The Daily editorial of April 12
pointed out that “. . . the Legisla
ture has seemed oblivious to the
changes going on about them;
uncertain what action to take, . . .
[and] the projects which the Leg
islature could tackle . . If given
the chance, 1 will do my best to
alleviate this situation. There are
many areas around campus in
which the Legislature could and
should take positive action such
as restoring the Fundamental
Standard to the Bookstore in the
ory and the rest of the campus in
actuality.
CHARLES WARNER
Stern Rep. to LASSU
I feel the LASSU should con
cern itself with matters of greater
importance than it has in the past.
I also believe the representative
should try to more nearly deter
mine the feelings of the students
he represents and strive for
greater cooperation with them.
808 PHILIBOSIAN
Stern Rep. to LASSU
The general duties of a Stern
representative to L eg i s 1 at ure
seem to me to be twofold. First,
he should be creative in present
ing and modifying legislation. As
Stern rep I would work to secure
changes in the ASSU Constitution
by-laws, revising the existing pro
visions for the now defunct Stern
i Club and its judicial council to

provide recognition of the current
Stern House Judicial Councils.
Second, the LASSU rep should
be responsive and responsible to
the men in the Stern Houses. By
attending house meetings, I would
seek opinion on proposed issues
and ideas for new legislation and
resolutions on subjects of inter
ests to Stern men and to the stu
dents in general.
|AY TINSMAN
Stern Rep. to LASSU
In running for the office of rep
resentative to the LASSU, I would
like to affirm my intention of try
ing to determine as completely
and accurately as I can the opin
ions of those I represent. It seems
to me that a closer bond between
the students in Stern and their
representatives would be desir
able.
In addition to this, though, I
will try to correct what I feel is
an increasing need for the use of
the LASSU as an organ of de
termining and expressing student
opinion on issues of more than
campus concern.
