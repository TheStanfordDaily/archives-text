Men’s Row Rep. to LASSU
The Men’s Row Representatives
are responsible to those fraternity
men who live on the Row, They
are the fraternity’s voice to Leg
islature; the body which ulti
mately coordinates activities for
all Stanford students. The frater
nity system Includes more than
31 per cent of all Stanford men.
Therefore, the importance of rep
resenting this large segment of
Stanford students requires that
the representatives be experi
enced and well informed.
I am acquiring experience while
serving as house manager and
president of the House Manager’s
Association. 1 will do my best to
keep myself well informed as to
the needs of the Stanford com
munity and, in particular, to the
needs of the fraternity system.

Men’s Row Rep. to LASSU
Since becoming a member of
the IFC, I have become very in
terested in the unity and welfare

of (he fraternity system and have
learned the opinion of the fra
ternities on many issues. Thus the
office of Men’s Row Representa
tive would be well suitable to me,
and I think that I could do a com
petent job. As Men’s Row Repre
sentative. I would like to make
the fraternity stand, on each ques
tion, to he publicized so the school
can learn what we believe in and
not what uninformed students
think we believe.

Class presidential candidates
are traditionally status seekers.
The sophomore class has little
need for a president. I do not sup
port the abolition of class govern
ment; rather I would abolish the
myth surrounding the presidency
and replace it with a realistic ful
fillment of only the necessary
duties of class government.
Sophomore Cotillion, Sopho
more Reunion, routine class busi
ness. These purposes can be ful
-1 filled without wild schemes or
vague attempts to realize illusory
promises used to delude the elec
torate. If elected, I will organize
an efficient government that can
i operate, even without a useless
image at its head.

islature; the body which ulti
mately coordinates activities for
all Stanford students. The frater
nity system Includes more than
31 per cent of all Stanford men.
Therefore, the importance of rep
resenting this large segment of
Stanford students requires that
the representatives be experi
enced and well informed.
I am acquiring experience while
serving as house manager and
president of the House Manager’s
Association. 1 will do my best to
keep myself well informed as to
the needs of the Stanford com
munity and, in particular, to the
needs of the fraternity system.

Men’s Row Rep. to LASSU
Since becoming a member of
the IFC, I have become very in
terested in the unity and welfare

of (he fraternity system and have
learned the opinion of the fra
ternities on many issues. Thus the
office of Men’s Row Representa
tive would be well suitable to me,
and I think that I could do a com
petent job. As Men’s Row Repre
sentative. I would like to make
the fraternity stand, on each ques
tion, to he publicized so the school
can learn what we believe in and
not what uninformed students
think we believe.

’64 President
Class presidential candidates
are traditionally status seekers.
The sophomore class has little
need for a president. I do not sup
port the abolition of class govern
ment; rather I would abolish the
myth surrounding the presidency
and replace it with a realistic ful
fillment of only the necessary
duties of class government.
Sophomore Cotillion, Sopho
more Reunion, routine class busi
ness. These purposes can be ful
-1 filled without wild schemes or
vague attempts to realize illusory
promises used to delude the elec
torate. If elected, I will organize
an efficient government that can
i operate, even without a useless
image at its head.
