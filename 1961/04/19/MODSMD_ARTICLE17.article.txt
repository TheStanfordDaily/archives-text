# ASSU Presidency Sought by Six
## 
### 
I am convinced that the reason
for disinterest in student govern
ment is not inadequate informa
tion, but the fact that at the pres
ent time LASSU is not doing any
thing significant to merit atten
tion. The explosion of dynamism
and energy here at Stanford in
the past two years has up to now
only manifested itself in periferal
organizations like the Political
Union and HR. The student gov
ernment has not kept pace. LAS
SU is neither stirring enthusiasm
nor solving the school’s problems.
We must give ASSU more vital
ity, energy, and ideas.
I propose several changes in or
ganization; first, take the presi
dent off LASSU, freeing him for
his initiative capacity, and leaving
the Administrative Assistant as
chairman pro tempore. Secondly,
allow the president, with the help
of a kitchen cabinet composed of
the most dynamic, imaginative |
people in the student body, to I
lobby his ideas through LASSU.
One of the greatest problems
facing student government is the
lack of communication between
LASSU and the student body. 1
propose two stops to remedy this:
first, move LASSU out of Bow
man Alumni House and into Din
kelspiel, allowing the student
body’s interest groups to lobby
the legislators for the first half
hour. Second, every other week
in Dinkelspiel make the president
go before the school with his
kitchen cabinet to answer for
what he has or has not done in |
way of correcting campus prob
lems. At this time, too, students
could exercise the rare privilege
of airing their own complaints
and opinions. Besides helping
with ideas, it would do much to
ward bringing LASSU and stu
dents together and would greatly
stimulate student interest in cam
pus affairs.

Stanford’s new intellectual chal
lenge has been accepted by the
student body and is being ex
pressed in what I call. “The New
Enthusiasm.” Nothing could prove
this acceptance more pointedly
than the discussion excited by the
HUAC. The basic question of this
campaign is whether or not stu
dent government at Stanford can
accept this challenge. 1 maintain
that it not only can, but also will
with strong effective executive
leadership.
The present student adminis
trative bodies are sufficient in
form, i.e. the cabinet as repre
sentative of each of the vital stu
dent organizations on campus;
the LASSU as representative of
the totality of the student body;
and the ASSU President as the
executive leader. In order to live
up to the “New Enthusiasm”
must function as follows: (1) The
I cabinet must be the key idea cen
j ter in student policy in that it
represents the forces most clearly
comprising “The New Enthusi
asm,” (2) The President must act
as a lens to focus the diverse ideas
projected by the cabinet. 13) The
LASSU must act as the tradi
tional body representing the cam
pus as a whole to evaluate the
program presented to it. It is im
portant to note that this all de
pends on a strong executive lead
er, not so much a creator as a
skillful coordinator.
The foregoing presents an over
all plan, however, certain specif
ics must be mentioned, til A
Student Board or Curriculum
must be formed, responsible di
rectly to the executive and ori
ented toward the students as op
posed to the faculty. (2) The AS
SU Vice-president, an important
elected official, should be put in
charge of all ASSU tryouts there
by giving them more publicity
and making them more coordi
nated. (3) Along with a basic re
evaluation of the Fundamental
Standard, we must take a positive
step in making public the deci
sions of the Judicial Council in an
attempt to see how fully or com
pletely these decisions relate to
the concept of the Fundamental
Standard. This involves no need
for any names to be brought
forth. (4) The Daily must bo
made a more dynamic medium on
this campus. To do this we must
not only continue the investiga
tion being carried on at the mo
ment, but also, I feel, it would be
a powerful addition to allow one
column per day to LASSU com
missions for the airing of their
views on current problems. This
allowance must be made, for those
commissions represent the idea
groups on campus.

Despite the fact that I have
knocked on every door in Wilbur
and Stern and interrupted count
less meals, I realize that many of
you must rely simply on this
statement.
Without platitudes then, I offer
for your consideration my term
as the HR’s first sophomore busi
ness manager and my experience
this year providing liaison with
LASSU, Larry Royse, and the
Dean’s office. I thus claim both
a political and financial perspec
tive of the ASSU—a perspective
resulting for me in the dissatis
faction that has so greatly
prompted my bid for office.
There has been considerable
call for strength, vigor, and effi
ciency, and I have joined in it.
But the presidency and your deci
sion both require a body of prin
ciple. Claiming that the ASSU
should concern Itself not only
with the student body, but with
the University and the outside
world as well; I have extended
from the very beginning, propo
sals that indicate both what I
shall do with the ASSU in terms
of basic improvement and the di
rection the organization would
then take.
I have found you attentive, but
not eager, polite but not enthusi
astic my ultimate purpose
should be clear.

I desire to seek a creative, dy
namic, pressured, and coordinated
presidency. The issues in which
I am most concerned are:
1) The development of a brain
trust of creative individuals to
advise, communicate, and be the
major initiating body of student
government. The present Legis
lature and Cabinet are too bulky
for effective creative leadership.
2) T h e encouragement and
training of leadership as the key
to all good government, suggest
ing a leadership training program
for select freshmen. This would
include the instilling of enthusi
asm, the mechanics of organiza
tion, and information on opportu
nities for leadership.
3) Develop a more meaningful
relationship with the faculty, util
izing the graduate students as a
liaison to the faculty.
4) Promotion and stimulation
of student groups which can make
a beneficial addition to the uni
versity with emphasis on the cul
tural, academic, and religious as
pects.
5) Information campaign for
i the student body concerning the
Tressider Union, an important fu
ture center for student activity.
6) A weekly Daily article of a
critical and informative nature.
7) Promotion of the proposal
that freshmen elect a delegate at
large preserving the continuity of
class representation, and a re
evaluation of the married student
representation.
8t The request and acceptance
of student pressure, i.e. the open
office policy.
For the above proposals, I will
devote much time and effort and
take eight units each quarter.

Student government has begun
to die a little even before it has
fully matured. It is upon this
paradox of unqualified failure in
the midst of the unprecedented
success of the university that the
campaign should turn. What the
student body has done has been
impressive: what it has not done
has been more impressive. Conse
quently, I suggest an election
yardstick of proven administra
tive competence: dedicated, con
sistent, and successful participa
tion in varied campus activities.
The highest office must be filled
only by one of exceptional experi
ence and personal strength; we
deserve nothing less.
Tile ASSU is overshadowed by
competing organizations which it
should be leading and coordinat
ing; while its personnel is over
worked, vast reserves of available
talent are loft untapped. The
ASSU has followed when it should
have led, acquiesced where it
should have proposed.
These are the problems. Here
arc some of the 21 specific ways
I would meet them: publish LAS
SU agendas one week before
meetings, institute a permanent
public relations assistant to the
President, create a brain trust of
administrative assistants, insti
tute two cabinet hostels, extensive
use of freshmen on investigating
commissions, emphasis on the
cabinet as a planning body, and
election of part of the LASSU
representatives in the fall lo allow
sophomore participation.
It is a time for strength.

The only kind of student gov
ernment which I think is mean-
I ingful in a university such as ours
is one which is primarily, if not
exclusively, concerned with the
representation of student opinion.
This kind of student government
is both responsible and construc
tive. It is based upon the prin
ciple of cooperation, which should,
I believe, be exercised by the vari
ous student groups both in their
relation to each other and in their
relation with the university, i.e.
the faculty, the Board of Trustees,
and the administration. I see the
role of student government, artic
ulated by the President of the AS
SU, as facilitating and participat
ing in this kind of cooperation.
How to achieve such coopera
tion? I do not think it can be
achieved on anything but a grass
roots basis. As ASSU President
I would direct my attention to
wards investigating how ade
quately expressive of student
opinion already existing bodies
such as Legislature and the Cabi
net are, and, at the same time,
regularly convene an open and in
formal body, composed of at least
one member from each living
group, for discussion and com
ment on any and all aspects of
student life which can be affected
by student government.
It is the standing of the indi
vidual- which is important here.
Student government is, after all.
for the student, and. although w'e
seem to forget this fact come mid
terms, so is the university. As
ASSU President I would like to
sec these facts more often present
in our minds than they are now.
G think that through applied and
mutual cooperation responsible
and constructive student govern
ment is possible. That is why I
■ am running for the office of AS
i SU President.
