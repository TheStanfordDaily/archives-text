# Bonner vs. Murray for Senior V-P

KAYE BONNER
’62 Vice President
In order to widen tiie scope of
class government beyond social
coordination, which includes the
traditional senior class activities
—Happy Hours, Heritage Fund
and the Senior Ball—class govern
ment should promote other func
tions in which seniors are more
vitally interested: a study could
be made on a problem pertinent to
seniors by compiling information
gained from opinion polls into a
published report.
1 would suggest a new method
of selecting Ex Com members
which would insure a dedicated
group who would meet less often
as a whole, more often in smaller
committees.
|OAN MURRAY
'62 Vice President
After two years on the class
Ex Com I feel improvements can
bo made in the selection of Ex
Com members and in communica
tions with the class.
Ex Com should do more for the
individual members of the class
and provide activities which ap
peal to a greater number. Cer
tainly never forgetting the most
important -Happy Hours, Senior
Ball, and Graduation.
The senior year is the most im
portant with your support we
can make it the very best for '(>2!
