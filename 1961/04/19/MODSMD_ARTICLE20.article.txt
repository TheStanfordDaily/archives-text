# Two Running for Veep

Like most positions in student
government, the duties of the
Vice-President extend as far as
the officer wants to stretch them.
Of course, she will carry out her
expected tasks, presiding over the
Social Coordinating Committee
and acting in the president’s ab
sence, but she can go beyond this
to make social life a valuable con
tribution to the students.
By working at such jobs as
j member of class Ex-Coms and So
cial Vice-President of Lagunita, I
have experience with the publicity
and organization the Vice-Presi
dent handles. There seems to be
a barrier between “social” and
“intellectual” affairs. No one
Vice-President can destroy it, but
she can encourage social chairmen
to make exchanges more stimu
lating than the usual dessert or
coffee. Why not an exchange for
the Tuesday Evening Series? Or
two groups might sign up for the
same seminar after a speech or
lecture. The Foreign Student pro
grams and Faculty Associate Pro
grams need improvement. It is
hard to tell whether the presence
of members of the opposite sex
will increase interest in India's
economic problems, but wo could
try.
The ASSU Vice-President lias a
relatively unbiased seat, in the
Legislature and she is in a good
position to discover the gripes
and interests of (lie student body,
then relate them to LASSU. If
she is aware of tin* varied inter
ests of the represented croups,

the c6mmunications difficulty
might bo alleviated.
The Vice-President should in
form, initiate and represent. She
should see (hat new ideas are
originated and tested. The scat
in Legislature must be meaning
fid. She must work closely with
the president so that executive
policies are clear to the student
body. But in all her duties as
Vice-President, she must remem
ber that to have a vital student
body, we must have a student
body aware of one another's in
terests.

There is a pressing need for re
sponsible leadership in student
government, a leadership which
will not revolutionize the struc
ture of student committees and
social groups, but which will urge
them to take a more active and
effective part in the University
life.
The office of vice-president of
the student body has become a
mechanical clearing hoard for so
cial events and student activities.
It was originally intended that
this office serve as a center of
j communication and cooperation
between these groups and the stu
dent government. It is my intent
to reinstate this original purpose.
Having served on certain of
these committees, Pre-Reg and
Stanford Today and Tomorrow,
and as a social chairman for my
own living group, I have felt this
need for positive cooperation be
tween the committees, led b,y en
ergetic and responsible student
government.
