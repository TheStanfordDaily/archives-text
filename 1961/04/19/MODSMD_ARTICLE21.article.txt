LES NICHOLS
Toyon-ICC Rep. to LASSU
1 believe that Toyon men are in
terested in what LASSU does with j
our money and what actions it
takes on our behalf. I am equally
convinced that we cannot influ
ence intelligently the actions of
LASSU unless we can count our
selves a part of the attentive, well
informed public. I am running for
Toyon Representative on (he as
sumption that Toyon men want a
representative who will keep
them informed and who will carry
their sentiments to Legislature.
If elected. I will make available
to Toyon men information con
cerning Legislature's meetings. 1
will make every effort to deter
mine what Toyon feeling is on is
sues of special importance. I will
make Legislature’s actions con
cerning larger issues on campus
known by reporting regularly to
the elected representatives to
Inter Club Council.
DICK WEINIC
Toyon-ICC Rep. to LASSU
LASSU should create a focal
point for student opinion and
form a closer liaison between lliei

student body and the administra
tion by voicing more frequent
opinions on issues of University
policy.
Legislature should act to:
1 • Reprimand any Daily Editor
who would use his editorial power
to further the vested interests of
a particular organization or living
group. 2) Give ICC a public forum
for evaluating forthcoming Uni
versity proposals concerning the
Eating Club system. 3) Pave the
road to the east Toyon parking
lot. 41 Open the Cellar on Sun
days. 5) Investigate food handling
in all University operated resi
dences and commissaries to de
termine the causes of the three
cases of food poisoning on cam
pus last quarter.
