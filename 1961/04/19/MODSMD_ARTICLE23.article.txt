SUE DAVIDSON
Women's Row Rep. to LASSU
As both an interested Stanford
student and a member of ASSU
affiliated organizations, I have
often noticed the tendency of
LASSU to make decisions with
out having adequate evidence at
its disposal. Since LASSU has
the power to affect policy, func
tions and funds of almost every
residence and organization on
campus, this lack of evidence is
detrimental, no matter for what
reason it exists. This, very sim
ply, is the basis of my campaign
to represent the interests of the
Womenâ€™s Row and of the student
body as a whole in attending all
LASSU meetings as an informed
and open-minded participant.
