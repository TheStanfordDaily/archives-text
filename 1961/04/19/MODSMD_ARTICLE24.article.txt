# Three Seats Open on Men s Council
## 
### 
Men’s Council is a student judi
ciary body which deals with the
more serious disciplinary prob
lems. Its function is not just to
punigh but to help those who ap
pear before it as much as possible.
The important point is that it is
a student council, for this can
have distinct advantages. In many
cases the members might better
understand the students’ prob
lems than faculty members would
and might be better able to dis
cover all of the facts of a case.
Many penalties for various of
fenses are already set; but, by
taking the initiative in discover
ing and carefully considering the
facts of an Individual case, the set
rules, I believe, may be applied
with greater rationale. In fact, if
the preceding possibilities are not
taken advantage of, there are no
real reasons even for the exist
ence of a student judiciary coun
cil.
In (he three years which I have
been at Stanford I have known
many different types of individ
uals and feel that I have some
thing of a knowledge of the stu
dents and their problems that is
necessary for this position.

... It seems to me that by the
nature of the duties of Men’s
Council, they should “represent”
no one. Ideally, a candidate would
be judged largely on his ability
and experience. As far as I can
see, no one has established any
sore of correlation between these
characteristics and his living
area. . . .
As for ability, I consider myself
an able sort of person. High in
telligence and a reasonable, ob
jective sort of mind are two ca
pacities which would contribute
to my effectiveness as a member
of Men’s Council. By this time it
will be clear that false modesty is
not one of my failings.
I have had a good deal of ex
perience in student government
(in junior collegei. . .
I am of the opinion that there
is room for a liberal voice on
Men’s Council, and I tend to put
myself in this liberal category.
... If you have accepted my
bias that I would be a good addi
tion to Men’s Council I would ap
preciate your support at the polls.

The candidates for Men’s Coun
cil face (wo important problems
this election: the problem of com
munication and the problem of
adequate representation.
First, GREATER COMMUNI
CATION should exist between the
Men’s Council and the men of (he
University. This should be ac
complished in two ways. Through
closer cooperation with Funda
mental Standard Commission, the
goals and functions of Men’s
Council should be defined, and
publicized to (he student body.
Also, a summary of Men’s Coun
cil actions should be published in
The Daily after each council
meeting. This summary would
omit the names of the students
involved, but state the nature and
conclusions of the cases. By in
forming the student body of the
actual proceedings of Men’s Coun
cil, unbased criticism would be
eliminated and helpful critical
discussion of Men’s Council would
be stimulated.
Second, Men’s Council serves
and is supposed to represent the
entire male student body. Per
petually it is dominated by mem
bers of fraternal organizations.
These men represent only one as
pect of University living, and
Men’s Council should contain a
WIDER REPRESENTATION of
men’s living groups.

It is through, and because of. a
secondary contact with Men’s
Council that I became interested
in this election. This past year
when two members of my living
group went before Men’s Council,
I found it quite difficult to follow
their case- what they were
charged with, how their guilt or
innocence was established, and on
what basis their sentence was de
termined.
I did not agree with the method
of sentence determination at all.
To the best of my knowledge the
two were judged by Men’s Council
as to whether or not they were fit
individuals for Stanford society,
an almost impossible decision
without personal knowledge of
their character, and a value judg
ment at best.
So point one is to make all pos
sible information available and
point two is to be concerned with
only the violation in question.
Also, I strongly agree with the
philosophy behind the recent plan
to allow violators’ living groups to
determine and administer their
penalties. I hope to actively work
for installation of this program.

What is Men’s Council?
Your ideas on what the Council
represents, what the Council bases
its decision upon, and why the
Council is necessary are undoubt
edly nebulous.
I contend that, more should be
known about the functioning of
the Council and that it should be
a more representative body. Three
major policies will affect this
change:
II The Council should work
closely with Fundamental Stand
ard Commission. An effective ed
ucational program directed by the
commission could prevent misin
terpretations of the Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard which
often develop into Men’s Council
cases.
2) Accounts of representative
Men’s Council decisions (names
omitted) should be published in
order to minimize inconsistencies
that seem to bo present.
3 1 There should he a definite
boundary to Council’s jurisdic
tion. More cases should be han
dled by separate house councils,
IFC or ICC with Men’s Council
acting as appellate body. In ma
jor cases Men’s Council is spokes
man for the entire university.

Empathy, as defined by Web
ster, means “imaginative projec
tions of one’s own consciousness
into another’s being.” From per
sonal experience, I am well aware
of the necessity for council mem
bers to possess this trait.
I do not mean to imply that I
want to “soften” Men’s Council.
How'ever, I am in favor of publi
cizing council decisions so that
everyone can know the precedents
upon which the decisions are
based. Naturally this can and
should be done in such away as
to keep those involved anony
mous.
Men’s Judicial Council is, and
will continue to be, an effective
example of Student Government.
I believe that I have a contribu
tion to make and I would appi’e
ciate the chance to do so.

In the past years the Men’s
Council has certainly fulfilled its
duties with intelligent reviews of
all cases concerned. For this rea
son there is no fundamental
change that appears to be neces
sary. What could be added to
Men’s Council, however, is a new
member, that member being a
representative of the Stern Toyon
group. In all equal fairness that
group should be represented by
being given a seat on the Coun
cil; and if I can do anything
about it, 1 certainly will. Other
than this I see no important
change needed; but if elected, I
would appreciate suggestions
from the students that might fa
cilitate the actions of Men’s Coun
cil.
