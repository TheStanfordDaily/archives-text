The basic cause of campus
apathy lies not in the character of
the students themselves, but in
lack of communication between
students and the objects of their
apathy. Here are several exam
ples of this lack which I propose
to improve:
1. Each Lagunita girl should
know that she is personally repre
sented in her student legislature,
and is informed of current legis
lation.
2. Communications obviously
need to be improved between
LASSU and The Daily, so stu
dents receive clear information
about current campus events.
3. Students should have a voice
