# Women's Council Explains Changes
## 
### 
Candidates for Women’s Coun
cil cannot be expected to have a
platform per se, as other candi
dates do, since tlie very nature of
the organization precludes know
ing what changes and ideas are
practical and can be put into ef
fect until one is actually a mem
ber.
For instance, two revisions
made this quarter were 1) revi
sion of the wording of the Funda
mental Standard charges to make
them more realistic and explicit.
Instead of two of the former cate
gories: Placing yourself in a so
cially unacceptable position
through using poor judgment,
and conduct unbecoming a Stan
ford Woman, the categories now
are: Major violation of the Social
Regulations due to poor judg
ment, and misconduct resulting
in: at destruction of property, b)
disturbance of the peace. c> dis
regard of other people's welfare,
d) endangering one’s personal
welfare. The remaining categories
of Deliberate Disregard of the So
cial Regulations. Intent to De
ceive, and Gross Negligence re
main unchanged.
The second major change made
was in Appeal Procedure, which is
that one now must phone Council
Office during office hours to
make an appointment.
These changes result from the
duty of Women’s Council to in
terpret Social Regulations made
by AWS. These are not new So
cial Regulations.
The other two main functions
are education and enforcement of
the Social Regulations for Stan
ford women.
