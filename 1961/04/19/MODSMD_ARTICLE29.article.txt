Stanford’s student government
can be and should be an essential
part of the school’s character. At
the present, however, the student
government is ineffectual be
cause it does not adequately rep
resent the students; one of the
most glaring deficiencies is the
complete lack of regard for the
sophomore class. Since it is im
possible for the sophomore class
to elect any representatives to
either LASSU or Men’s Council,
it will be the goal of the sopho
more class government to repre
sent its members and to effective
ly promote the best of their in
terests.

I am running unopposed for the
office of sophomore class vice
president. This says a lot about
how little we are. Our class has
ideas, interests, integrity, and in
telligence - for what they’re
| worth. What are they worth if
I we’re not willing to do something
with them? Are we content to
conform to a pattern of selfish
concern, but communal apathy?
Are we going to spend the next
three years in sophisticated little
circles making the “right” cynical
remarks about the things that
1 aren’t being done on campus?
j What is being done? What are we
I doing? What are we interested in
j doing? We DO have interests—
let’s get the people in our class
who have strong interests and are
acting upon them onto the soph
omore class Ex-Com to express
their interests.
