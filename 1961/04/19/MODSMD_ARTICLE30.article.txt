# AWS Secretary Post
## 
### 
Secretary â€”Susan Westerberg
Associated Women Students can
be an effective organization if en
thusiastic officers work to inter
est other women students. Many
have complained about AWS this
year, but few have given their
time to improve the situation. One
example of such lack of concern is
the apathy toward AWS elections.

After serving on an AWS commit
tee this year, I feel that I under
stand the purposes and duties of
the AWS cabinet.
