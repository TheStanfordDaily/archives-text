# USC Favored in Triangular Meet
## 
### KEN DERY Sports Editor 
The burden of proof is on USC.
Carrying a string of 94 straight
dual meets without a loss into
Saturday’s triangular and triple
dual meets with Oregon and Stan
ford, the Trojans will have all
they can handle in their clash
with the fleet Ducks.
National champions in 1958
the 20th time in 28 NCAA cham
pionship meets competed in the
Trojans are regarded as the num
ber one team in the country. Ore
gon is rated just a shade behind.
WITH ITS ranks bolstered by
three men who recorded the na
tion’s best collegiate marks in
their respective events, this year’s
squad is truly superb.
Heading the list of returning
lettermen are Luther Hayes a
hop, step, jump man; Dallas
Long, the massive shot-putter and
Jim Wade, a 6-6, 235-pound discus
t wirier.

Hayes, last year’s hop, step,
jump champion, has been concen
trating exclusively on the broad
jump and he has gone as welt as
24-10't<. Behind him is Bill Jack
son, who has lied Hayes’ best
leap.

Shot-putter Long, a bronze
medal winner at the Olympic
Games in Rome last summer, is
without peer in the college ranks.
His 64-6‘a last year is a record
and he has hit over 64 feet already
this season.
WADE and Jim Brewer took
seconds in last year’s NCAA 1

: meet and will be tough to beat
| in their respective events.
| Junior Wade has heaved the'
discus 177-11. To add to the fun,
footballer Dave Washington has
recorded 164-3 L.
Brewer appears to he headed

for the great pole vault season
that was predicted for him upon
his entrance into SC. His 15-414
last year has been topped by only
one man in Trojan history.
But this is just the start of the
rogue’s gallery. Don’t forget two
year letterman Bob Shordone in
the javelin. The 6-7, 225-pounder
1 has sent the light pole 256-10'-.
\ and to give some idea as to USC’s
'depth there is also Dick Tomlin
! ;on, who has done 240-3'a.
IN THE HIGH jump co-captain
Bob Avant has cleared 6-11 in
doors. Norm Grundy (6-10 '4 ) will
give SC more than just an aver
age number two man.
While not quite as strong as
Oregon’s sprinters, Coach Jess
Mortensen can still enter Bobby
Staten (47.4 1 in the quarter, Jim
Bates (9.6, 21.1) in the century
and 220 Bruce Munn (9.7, 21.0)
and Rusty Weeks (9.8, 21.4) in
(he century and 220.
Troy’s mile relay team of
I Staten, Dean Balzarett (47.5),
Kevin Hogan (46.2) and Rex Caw
ley (46.3) have already whipped
| off a time of 3:07.9, a new col
legiate record.

Students planning to attend the
Stan ford-SC-Oregon track meet in
the Stadium Saturday are urged
to buy their tickets ahead of time.
They are on sale from X-12 and 1-5

Student prices are 50 cents while
general admission is $1.50.
A crowd of 20,000 is expected

ing at (he Stadium on Saturday
could be a bedlam, according to

licity director.
