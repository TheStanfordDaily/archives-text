## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Sophomore Darrell Sutherland'
■ pitched a six-hit shutout to lead
1 the Stanford buseballers over San
Jose State 8-0.
Sutherland struck out nine I
| while walking only three, one of (
the best performances by any In 1
dian hinder this year.
SAN JOSE was never in the
contest. Stanford got a 1-0 lead in
1 the first inning, when Hal Schut/.-
mann doubled to left field, went
to third on Lee Moench’s ground
out, and scored on Gregg Post’s
| towering sacrifice fly to center
field.
Stanford put the game in the
bag in the fourth inning, scoring
four runs with some good hitting
and sloppy Spartan defensive
play. Post opened the frame with
a walk and went to third on Bob
Overman’s single to left field.
Overman took second when the
Spartan second sacker fumbled
the throw from the outfield.
Rich Ferrazzano’s single drove
in Post, and Overman scored on

| Mike Magee's infield out. Fer- 1
' razzano scored on Joel Shulman’s
one-baser. Shulman eventually!
; came in following a Spartan error
| and a wild pitch.
THE INDIANS got three un- !
earned tallies in the seventh!
1 inning. John Hurlbut doubled, |
I Ferrazano singled him home, Ma-
I gee singled to deep shortstop!
I sending Ferraz/ano to second |
i base. Both advanced another base
when the shortstop threw the ball
away, and scored on Shulman's
i third single of the day.
Sutherland’s shutout was in |
danger several times. With two
out in the third inning, two Spar
tans got on and the next batter
lined a hit over second base that
Magee knocked down. He trapped
the San Jose State man going
around third. In a rundown the
man got back to third, but the
batter who originally singled was
picked off at first base, after he
i tried to steal second with the base
already occupied.
In the Spartan half of the sev

enth inning, Sutherland loaded
j the bases with one out, but
1 pitched himself out of the jam by
getting the next two hitters to
ground out to the pitchers’ mound
! and strike out respectively.
THE GAME saw Sutherland’s
string of hitless innings stopped.
! A spartan beat out a bunt single
in the third inning to stop the
string at 11 l innings without a
hit by the opposition.
Two Indians made several
brilliant plays to back up Suther
land’s pitching. In the first in
ning, second baseman Magee dove
at a ground ball and threw the
runner out at first while sitting
on the outfield grass. For the last
out of the game, Bob Hensler
chased a long fly to left field and
caught it just before running into
the bank in left field.
