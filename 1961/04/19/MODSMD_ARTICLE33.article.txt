East Is East, and West Is West

Call it provincialism, but there’s nothing we like better than the i
opportunity to take a few digs at the East. After every football and !
basketball season the Eastern athletes, with the blessings of the New
York, Chicago. Boston, Philadelphia, etc. sportswriters,overrun the
All-American teams. Even wdth the recent successes of California in
basketball and Washington in football, the Western colleges are con- |
sidered athletically inferior.
NOW WE GET A chance to crow. On the basis of (he 1961 track

season it is apparent that track
power, which used to be centeied
in the East and then in the Mid
west, has shifted to the Pacific
slopes; Western schools have a
virtual stranglehold on the sport.
Take a look at the collegiate
marks for the current campaign.
Of the 15 events usually run in
college meets, 11 of the season’s
top marks belong to West Coast
athletes. The other four top per
formances belong to cindermen
from Oklahoma, Tennessee and
Texas—not an Easterner in the
bunch!
The West comes closest to com
pletely monopolizing collegiate
track in the middle distances; the
440. 880 and mile. All 13 of the
fastest quarter-milers in the na
tion hail from west of the Rockies
with USC’s Rex Cawler leading
the pack with a 42.2 clocking.

OREGON'S DVROE BURLESON is pacing the nation’s half-milers
and here, again, is another example of the Pacific Coast’s domina- |
lion. Of the best times there are 13 from the West, three from the
Midwest and none from the East. Ditto for the mile University of
Oregon trackmen own three of the four fastest times.
Fact is that we could go on almost indefinitely because in all of i
the running events, only two athletes from the distant side of the i
Mississippi have turned in fast enough times to rank among the top |
10 in their particular speciality.
Field and hurdle events are more of the same. USC all by itself j
has five of the nine first places in these categories and, if it weien’l
for Tennessee A&l’s Olympic champion Ralph Boston, who has I
topped the high hurdles in 13.7 to edge USC’s Boh Pierce’s best by
two seconds, the southlanders would have an even half dozen,
A CALIFORNIAN HOLDS the javelin record and two Oklahoma
residents pace the pole vaulters and broad jumpers. Somebody for- i
got to add the East.
There are some good reasons for the trend toward the West. Bet- j
ter climate year ’round training and competition, fewer cities and I
more room to run.
Some detractors might claim that (he Eastern schools begin their |
season later in the spring and will take over later in the year, but in i
the 1960 NCAA track finals, out of the five-school AAWU Confer- i
ence, USC finished second, UCLA third and Stanford sixth. Oregon j
and Oregon State tied for fourth and San Jose State tied Stanford
among the other coast representatives while Boston University was j
the only East Coast school listed in the top in. That should be suffi
cient proof that the West is best.

The Clincher
ANYONE NOT CONVINCED by now can see the clincher this!
Saturday when Stanford hosts Southern Cal and Oregon in what j
should be the best meet of the year, and one of the best in coast j
track annals.
Stanford, a power in past seasons, is too thin at the moment to
be ranked as one of the leading teams in the country, but the Indians j
do have a few individual performers who are outstanding.
Don Moore just broke the 25-foot barrier in the broad jump 1
against UCLA last Saturday by leaping 25-1, fourth best in the na
tion. Rich Klier is another local sporting a top mark, his 1:51.1 in the
880, also good for fourth. Art Batchelder 233-3 in the javelin, and
Phil White, sneaking up on 15 feet in the pole vault, are two more
standout Cards.
THE REAL ATTRACTION, of course, will be the dual compe
tition between Oregon and SC. Southern Cal’s last dual meet loss
was in 1933 and they’re facing probably the strongest possible chal
lenge in the northland Ducks. Add in the fact that SC mentor Jess
Mortenson had a few choice insults for Oregon Athletic Director
Leo Harris earlier in the year, and a natural rivalry results.
On the basis of the form book USC is favored to win again but I
fans attending the Saturday meet just may witness the end of a I
28-year victory skien. And in addition they may see a sub-four-minute I
mile, a 65-foot shot-put and assorted other records in any event it !
will be the best college track that the U S. can offer.

and Oregon State tied for fourth and San Jose State tied Stanford
among the other coast representatives while Boston University was j
the only East Coast school listed in the top in. That should be suffi
cient proof that the West is best.

The Clincher
ANYONE NOT CONVINCED by now can see the clincher this!
Saturday when Stanford hosts Southern Cal and Oregon in what j
should be the best meet of the year, and one of the best in coast j
track annals.
Stanford, a power in past seasons, is too thin at the moment to
be ranked as one of the leading teams in the country, but the Indians j
do have a few individual performers who are outstanding.
Don Moore just broke the 25-foot barrier in the broad jump 1
against UCLA last Saturday by leaping 25-1, fourth best in the na
tion. Rich Klier is another local sporting a top mark, his 1:51.1 in the
880, also good for fourth. Art Batchelder 233-3 in the javelin, and
Phil White, sneaking up on 15 feet in the pole vault, are two more
standout Cards.
THE REAL ATTRACTION, of course, will be the dual compe
tition between Oregon and SC. Southern Cal’s last dual meet loss
was in 1933 and they’re facing probably the strongest possible chal
lenge in the northland Ducks. Add in the fact that SC mentor Jess
Mortenson had a few choice insults for Oregon Athletic Director
Leo Harris earlier in the year, and a natural rivalry results.
On the basis of the form book USC is favored to win again but I
fans attending the Saturday meet just may witness the end of a I
28-year victory skien. And in addition they may see a sub-four-minute I
mile, a 65-foot shot-put and assorted other records in any event it !
will be the best college track that the U S. can offer.

East Is East, and West Is West

Call it provincialism, but there’s nothing we like better than the i
opportunity to take a few digs at the East. After every football and !
basketball season the Eastern athletes, with the blessings of the New
York, Chicago. Boston, Philadelphia, etc. sportswriters,overrun the
All-American teams. Even wdth the recent successes of California in
basketball and Washington in football, the Western colleges are con- |
sidered athletically inferior.
NOW WE GET A chance to crow. On the basis of (he 1961 track

season it is apparent that track
power, which used to be centeied
in the East and then in the Mid
west, has shifted to the Pacific
slopes; Western schools have a
virtual stranglehold on the sport.
Take a look at the collegiate
marks for the current campaign.
Of the 15 events usually run in
college meets, 11 of the season’s
top marks belong to West Coast
athletes. The other four top per
formances belong to cindermen
from Oklahoma, Tennessee and
Texas—not an Easterner in the
bunch!
The West comes closest to com
pletely monopolizing collegiate
track in the middle distances; the
440. 880 and mile. All 13 of the
fastest quarter-milers in the na
tion hail from west of the Rockies
with USC’s Rex Cawler leading
the pack with a 42.2 clocking.

OREGON'S DVROE BURLESON is pacing the nation’s half-milers
and here, again, is another example of the Pacific Coast’s domina- |
lion. Of the best times there are 13 from the West, three from the
Midwest and none from the East. Ditto for the mile University of
Oregon trackmen own three of the four fastest times.
Fact is that we could go on almost indefinitely because in all of i
the running events, only two athletes from the distant side of the i
Mississippi have turned in fast enough times to rank among the top |
10 in their particular speciality.
Field and hurdle events are more of the same. USC all by itself j
has five of the nine first places in these categories and, if it weien’l
for Tennessee A&l’s Olympic champion Ralph Boston, who has I
topped the high hurdles in 13.7 to edge USC’s Boh Pierce’s best by
two seconds, the southlanders would have an even half dozen,
A CALIFORNIAN HOLDS the javelin record and two Oklahoma
residents pace the pole vaulters and broad jumpers. Somebody for- i
got to add the East.
There are some good reasons for the trend toward the West. Bet- j
ter climate year ’round training and competition, fewer cities and I
more room to run.
Some detractors might claim that (he Eastern schools begin their |
season later in the spring and will take over later in the year, but in i
the 1960 NCAA track finals, out of the five-school AAWU Confer- i
ence, USC finished second, UCLA third and Stanford sixth. Oregon j

from Oklahoma, Tennessee and
Texas—not an Easterner in the
bunch!
The West comes closest to com
pletely monopolizing collegiate
track in the middle distances; the
440. 880 and mile. All 13 of the
fastest quarter-milers in the na
tion hail from west of the Rockies
with USC’s Rex Cawler leading
the pack with a 42.2 clocking.

OREGON'S DVROE BURLESON is pacing the nation’s half-milers
and here, again, is another example of the Pacific Coast’s domina- |
lion. Of the best times there are 13 from the West, three from the
Midwest and none from the East. Ditto for the mile University of
Oregon trackmen own three of the four fastest times.
Fact is that we could go on almost indefinitely because in all of i
the running events, only two athletes from the distant side of the i
Mississippi have turned in fast enough times to rank among the top |
10 in their particular speciality.
Field and hurdle events are more of the same. USC all by itself j
has five of the nine first places in these categories and, if it weien’l
for Tennessee A&l’s Olympic champion Ralph Boston, who has I
topped the high hurdles in 13.7 to edge USC’s Boh Pierce’s best by
two seconds, the southlanders would have an even half dozen,
A CALIFORNIAN HOLDS the javelin record and two Oklahoma
residents pace the pole vaulters and broad jumpers. Somebody for- i
got to add the East.
There are some good reasons for the trend toward the West. Bet- j
ter climate year ’round training and competition, fewer cities and I
more room to run.
Some detractors might claim that (he Eastern schools begin their |
season later in the spring and will take over later in the year, but in i
the 1960 NCAA track finals, out of the five-school AAWU Confer- i
ence, USC finished second, UCLA third and Stanford sixth. Oregon j
and Oregon State tied for fourth and San Jose State tied Stanford
among the other coast representatives while Boston University was j
the only East Coast school listed in the top in. That should be suffi
cient proof that the West is best.

The Clincher
ANYONE NOT CONVINCED by now can see the clincher this!
Saturday when Stanford hosts Southern Cal and Oregon in what j
should be the best meet of the year, and one of the best in coast j
track annals.
Stanford, a power in past seasons, is too thin at the moment to
be ranked as one of the leading teams in the country, but the Indians j
do have a few individual performers who are outstanding.
Don Moore just broke the 25-foot barrier in the broad jump 1
against UCLA last Saturday by leaping 25-1, fourth best in the na
tion. Rich Klier is another local sporting a top mark, his 1:51.1 in the
880, also good for fourth. Art Batchelder 233-3 in the javelin, and
Phil White, sneaking up on 15 feet in the pole vault, are two more
standout Cards.
THE REAL ATTRACTION, of course, will be the dual compe
tition between Oregon and SC. Southern Cal’s last dual meet loss
was in 1933 and they’re facing probably the strongest possible chal
lenge in the northland Ducks. Add in the fact that SC mentor Jess
Mortenson had a few choice insults for Oregon Athletic Director
Leo Harris earlier in the year, and a natural rivalry results.
On the basis of the form book USC is favored to win again but I
fans attending the Saturday meet just may witness the end of a I
28-year victory skien. And in addition they may see a sub-four-minute I
mile, a 65-foot shot-put and assorted other records in any event it !
will be the best college track that the U S. can offer.

East Is East, and West Is West

Call it provincialism, but there’s nothing we like better than the i
opportunity to take a few digs at the East. After every football and !
basketball season the Eastern athletes, with the blessings of the New
York, Chicago. Boston, Philadelphia, etc. sportswriters,overrun the
All-American teams. Even wdth the recent successes of California in
basketball and Washington in football, the Western colleges are con- |
sidered athletically inferior.
NOW WE GET A chance to crow. On the basis of (he 1961 track

season it is apparent that track
power, which used to be centeied
in the East and then in the Mid
west, has shifted to the Pacific
slopes; Western schools have a
virtual stranglehold on the sport.
Take a look at the collegiate
marks for the current campaign.
Of the 15 events usually run in
college meets, 11 of the season’s
top marks belong to West Coast
athletes. The other four top per
formances belong to cindermen
from Oklahoma, Tennessee and
Texas—not an Easterner in the
