# Biggest Class Race: '63
## 
### 
To promise that, if elected. I
would attempt and effect sweep
ing reforms would be folly, for
the Junior Class President, as all
class officers, is restricted by the
constitution. Basically, a class
president is responsible for stimu
lating and organizing cultural and
social activities for his particular
class. This traditional function
should be retained.
In addition, however, there is
room for expansion and reform.
Specifically, 1 am referring to the
class president’s seat on the ASSU
cabinet and his efforts in this ca
pacity. The cabinet of nearly 20
can be an effective instrument in
s udent government. The efforts
of a class officer in this capacity
could be rewarding to his class
specifically, and the students, gen
erally. I clearly see an opportun
ity here and intend to cultivate
it if elected.

In these past two years it has
become more apparent that class
government is nothing but a joke.
A progressive university such as
Stanford should not be faced with
the problem of poor and apathetic
class leadership. During last
year's election I became more

aware that our class needs posi
tive leadership. This year I am
prepared with a full and active
program which will put real lead
ership behind class government.
My program will move into ef
fect the day after elected. The
Ex-Com will be chosen and plans
for a successful Junior Prom will
be laid. Plans for class picnics
and opportunities for you to use
your almost forgotten class cards
will also be enacted. Class gov
ernment needs a boost—that boost
is Randy Vahan.

Class government is definitely

not government at all! It has ab
solutely no ability or power to
legislate or enforce enactments
over the members of the class;
and thus, class organization be
comes primarily an instrument
for providing collective diversion
for the largest number of class
members, and for supplementing
the activities of other campus or
ganizations and groups. Often,
we find that our campus and class
acquaintances are limited by our
strict adherence to club, dormi
tory and fraternity functions.
This is where the class organiza
tion enters, by not only providing
the chance for class members to
get together for an activity, but
also by providing a better degree
of entertainment and atmosphere
for activities: one that could not
be duplicated by a smaller organ
ization or residence because of the
lack of finances, facilities and
composite Influence.

Next year the job of I he Presi
dent of the Class of ’63 will entail
more work than it ever has in the
past. I have ideas, and the sup
port of several people whom I be
lieve to be well qualified for Ex-
Com. For this reason I have de
cided to run for Junior Class
President.
I live in Atherton, and would
therefore be available to do work
during the summer.
I feel increased organization in
class government, participation in
sponsored University activities,
and a reduction of governmental
flatulation is important.
No matter who you arc sup
porting, remember to VOTE!

Class of ’63. instead of having a
vast array of projects with half
vast support, we must concen
trate on quality in our existing
class activities. This quality in ac
tivities demands a corresponding
ly high quality in both the execu
tive and administrative aspects of
presidential leadership.
My plans are for this quality in
our junior responsibilities such
as the Junior Prom and Bachelor
Week. But to do this the presi
dent must have the complete sup
port of his class. Start now,
VOTE.

We, the class of nineteen sixty
three, although a strong class, are
not a unified one. It is my pur
pose to bring unification to our
class through such things as a
regular newsletter, several all
class meetings, and an increased
social program with at least one
function a quarter ending spring
quarter with a Luau at the beach.
It is my belief that through effi
cient and careful planning we will
be able to end the year with more,
instead of less, money in our
treasury. If I am elected junior
class president, I will work to my
utmost ability to make the class
of nineteen sixty-three outstand
ing both politically and socially.

Alt hough controversial, eye
catching reforms are a popular
approach to student body election
eering, I believe a sincere declara
tion of intent to organize and di
rect efficiently and successfully
is more indicative of what can be
accomplished by class officers. It
is not their job to impose their
will upon the class but to admin
istrate. They must make the; ex
isting system work as smoothly
as possible adding only those in
novations that will strengthen (he
system. They must provide
strong, alert, and experienced
leadership to the class as a whole
and especially to those expressing
a desire to help directly with class
sponsored activities.

government is nothing but a joke.
A progressive university such as
Stanford should not be faced with
the problem of poor and apathetic
class leadership. During last
year's election I became more

aware that our class needs posi
tive leadership. This year I am
prepared with a full and active
program which will put real lead
ership behind class government.
My program will move into ef
fect the day after elected. The
Ex-Com will be chosen and plans
for a successful Junior Prom will
be laid. Plans for class picnics
and opportunities for you to use
your almost forgotten class cards
will also be enacted. Class gov
ernment needs a boost—that boost
is Randy Vahan.

Class government is definitely

not government at all! It has ab
solutely no ability or power to
legislate or enforce enactments
over the members of the class;
and thus, class organization be
comes primarily an instrument
for providing collective diversion
for the largest number of class
members, and for supplementing
the activities of other campus or
ganizations and groups. Often,
we find that our campus and class
acquaintances are limited by our
strict adherence to club, dormi
tory and fraternity functions.
This is where the class organiza
tion enters, by not only providing
the chance for class members to
get together for an activity, but
also by providing a better degree
of entertainment and atmosphere
for activities: one that could not
be duplicated by a smaller organ
ization or residence because of the
lack of finances, facilities and
composite Influence.

Next year the job of I he Presi
dent of the Class of ’63 will entail
more work than it ever has in the
past. I have ideas, and the sup
port of several people whom I be
lieve to be well qualified for Ex-
Com. For this reason I have de
cided to run for Junior Class
President.
I live in Atherton, and would
therefore be available to do work
during the summer.
I feel increased organization in
class government, participation in
sponsored University activities,
and a reduction of governmental
flatulation is important.
No matter who you arc sup
porting, remember to VOTE!

Class of ’63. instead of having a
vast array of projects with half
vast support, we must concen
trate on quality in our existing
class activities. This quality in ac
tivities demands a corresponding
ly high quality in both the execu
tive and administrative aspects of
presidential leadership.
My plans are for this quality in
our junior responsibilities such
as the Junior Prom and Bachelor
Week. But to do this the presi
dent must have the complete sup
port of his class. Start now,
VOTE.

We, the class of nineteen sixty
three, although a strong class, are
not a unified one. It is my pur
pose to bring unification to our
class through such things as a
regular newsletter, several all
class meetings, and an increased
social program with at least one
function a quarter ending spring
quarter with a Luau at the beach.
It is my belief that through effi
cient and careful planning we will
be able to end the year with more,
instead of less, money in our
treasury. If I am elected junior
class president, I will work to my
utmost ability to make the class
of nineteen sixty-three outstand
ing both politically and socially.

Alt hough controversial, eye
catching reforms are a popular
approach to student body election
eering, I believe a sincere declara
tion of intent to organize and di
rect efficiently and successfully
is more indicative of what can be
accomplished by class officers. It
is not their job to impose their
will upon the class but to admin
istrate. They must make the; ex
isting system work as smoothly
as possible adding only those in
novations that will strengthen (he
system. They must provide
strong, alert, and experienced
leadership to the class as a whole
and especially to those expressing
a desire to help directly with class
sponsored activities.

To promise that, if elected. I
would attempt and effect sweep
ing reforms would be folly, for
the Junior Class President, as all
class officers, is restricted by the
constitution. Basically, a class
president is responsible for stimu
lating and organizing cultural and
social activities for his particular
class. This traditional function
should be retained.
In addition, however, there is
room for expansion and reform.
Specifically, 1 am referring to the
class president’s seat on the ASSU
cabinet and his efforts in this ca
pacity. The cabinet of nearly 20
can be an effective instrument in
s udent government. The efforts
of a class officer in this capacity
could be rewarding to his class
specifically, and the students, gen
erally. I clearly see an opportun
ity here and intend to cultivate
it if elected.

for providing collective diversion
for the largest number of class
members, and for supplementing
the activities of other campus or
ganizations and groups. Often,
we find that our campus and class
acquaintances are limited by our
strict adherence to club, dormi
tory and fraternity functions.
This is where the class organiza
tion enters, by not only providing
the chance for class members to
get together for an activity, but
also by providing a better degree
of entertainment and atmosphere
for activities: one that could not
be duplicated by a smaller organ
ization or residence because of the
lack of finances, facilities and
composite Influence.

Next year the job of I he Presi
dent of the Class of ’63 will entail
more work than it ever has in the
past. I have ideas, and the sup
port of several people whom I be
lieve to be well qualified for Ex-
Com. For this reason I have de
cided to run for Junior Class
President.
I live in Atherton, and would
therefore be available to do work
during the summer.
I feel increased organization in
class government, participation in
sponsored University activities,
and a reduction of governmental
flatulation is important.
No matter who you arc sup
porting, remember to VOTE!

Class of ’63. instead of having a
vast array of projects with half
vast support, we must concen
trate on quality in our existing
class activities. This quality in ac
tivities demands a corresponding
ly high quality in both the execu
tive and administrative aspects of
presidential leadership.
My plans are for this quality in
our junior responsibilities such
as the Junior Prom and Bachelor
Week. But to do this the presi
dent must have the complete sup
port of his class. Start now,
VOTE.

We, the class of nineteen sixty
three, although a strong class, are
not a unified one. It is my pur
pose to bring unification to our
class through such things as a
regular newsletter, several all
class meetings, and an increased
social program with at least one
function a quarter ending spring
quarter with a Luau at the beach.
It is my belief that through effi
cient and careful planning we will
be able to end the year with more,
instead of less, money in our
treasury. If I am elected junior
class president, I will work to my
utmost ability to make the class
of nineteen sixty-three outstand
ing both politically and socially.

Alt hough controversial, eye
catching reforms are a popular
approach to student body election
eering, I believe a sincere declara
tion of intent to organize and di
rect efficiently and successfully
is more indicative of what can be
accomplished by class officers. It
is not their job to impose their
will upon the class but to admin
istrate. They must make the; ex
isting system work as smoothly
as possible adding only those in
novations that will strengthen (he
system. They must provide
strong, alert, and experienced
leadership to the class as a whole
and especially to those expressing
a desire to help directly with class
sponsored activities.

To promise that, if elected. I
would attempt and effect sweep
ing reforms would be folly, for
the Junior Class President, as all
class officers, is restricted by the
constitution. Basically, a class
president is responsible for stimu
lating and organizing cultural and
social activities for his particular
class. This traditional function
should be retained.
In addition, however, there is
room for expansion and reform.
Specifically, 1 am referring to the
class president’s seat on the ASSU
cabinet and his efforts in this ca
pacity. The cabinet of nearly 20
can be an effective instrument in
s udent government. The efforts
of a class officer in this capacity
could be rewarding to his class
specifically, and the students, gen
erally. I clearly see an opportun
ity here and intend to cultivate
it if elected.

In these past two years it has
become more apparent that class
government is nothing but a joke.
A progressive university such as
Stanford should not be faced with
the problem of poor and apathetic
class leadership. During last
year's election I became more

aware that our class needs posi
tive leadership. This year I am
prepared with a full and active
program which will put real lead
ership behind class government.
My program will move into ef
fect the day after elected. The
Ex-Com will be chosen and plans
for a successful Junior Prom will
be laid. Plans for class picnics
and opportunities for you to use
your almost forgotten class cards
will also be enacted. Class gov
ernment needs a boost—that boost
is Randy Vahan.

Class government is definitely

not government at all! It has ab
solutely no ability or power to
legislate or enforce enactments
over the members of the class;
and thus, class organization be
comes primarily an instrument
for providing collective diversion
for the largest number of class
members, and for supplementing
the activities of other campus or
ganizations and groups. Often,
