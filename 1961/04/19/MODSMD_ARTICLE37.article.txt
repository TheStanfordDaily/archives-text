AL ALEXANDER
Off Campus Rep. to LASSU
As candidate tor off-campus |
representative I intend to repre
sent with diligence and sincere
concern the numerous and diverse |
groups of married and unmarried
students living off-campus. Be l
sides promoting the interests of I
off-campus students I intend to
“clean out” the many ambiguities'
and contradictions existing in stu
dent government of the form
which caused question as to the
legality of my candidacy. It is
just such vagueness that must be
corrected before student govern
ment can ho transformed from an
impotent farce of imagined power
into a potent force capable of re
alizing its potential influence in
directing university policy and de
cisions.
CARTER HARRISON
Write-in for Off Campus Rep,
Better parking, permanent hos
tel, and an effective Union arc
three issues I would actively pro
mote as your LASSU representa
tive. My primary concern would
be to inform off-campus students
of the forthcoming Issues, be
readily available to discuss these
issues, then vigorously promote
the off-campus point of view. |
ROBERT KORTEN
Off Campus Rep. to LASSU
This year the Legislature has
proved ineffectual in the follow
ing regards: 1> It has failed to I
make clear student positions on i
academic policy. 2) It has not
taken the necessary leadership in
'he building of a permanent hos
tel site.
In the field of off-campus prob
lems the following must be at
tended to; 1 1 More off-campus
parking space. 2) More benches
on Palm Drive and Escondido. 3)
More co’Ua ■; between off-campus
men an.; their LASSU representa
tives.
I would like to be able to ropre
•cut this sometime- neglected por
tion of students in solving these
and other problems as your off
campus representative.
DAVID KRATTER
Off Campus Rep. to LASSU
In recent elections, the cam
paigns of most of the candidates
seem to have been based upon the
assumption that students have
limited powers in the determina
tion of their own affairs. I am
dissatisfied with this approach,

and I propose, if elected, to work
i diligently for an expansion of the
i opportunities for students to par
j ticipate in formulating the poll
i cies that concern them. Specifi
cally, I propose the following:
1. To coordinate both the objee
j lions and suggestions of my off
! campus constituents so that they
lean maintain and increase their
role in student government.
2. By petition legislation, and
referendum to strive to make the
administration aware of the fact
(hat (he students WANT, NEED,
AND MUST HAVE a more active
role in student affairs.

This year the Legislature has
proved ineffectual in the follow
ing regards: 1> It has failed to I
make clear student positions on i
academic policy. 2) It has not
taken the necessary leadership in
'he building of a permanent hos
tel site.
In the field of off-campus prob
lems the following must be at
tended to; 1 1 More off-campus
parking space. 2) More benches
on Palm Drive and Escondido. 3)
More co’Ua ■; between off-campus
men an.; their LASSU representa
tives.
I would like to be able to ropre
•cut this sometime- neglected por
tion of students in solving these
and other problems as your off
campus representative.
DAVID KRATTER
Off Campus Rep. to LASSU
In recent elections, the cam
paigns of most of the candidates
seem to have been based upon the
assumption that students have
limited powers in the determina
tion of their own affairs. I am
dissatisfied with this approach,

and I propose, if elected, to work
i diligently for an expansion of the
i opportunities for students to par
j ticipate in formulating the poll
i cies that concern them. Specifi
cally, I propose the following:
1. To coordinate both the objee
j lions and suggestions of my off
! campus constituents so that they
lean maintain and increase their
role in student government.
2. By petition legislation, and
referendum to strive to make the
administration aware of the fact
(hat (he students WANT, NEED,
AND MUST HAVE a more active
role in student affairs.

As candidate tor off-campus |
representative I intend to repre
sent with diligence and sincere
concern the numerous and diverse |
groups of married and unmarried
students living off-campus. Be l
sides promoting the interests of I
off-campus students I intend to
“clean out” the many ambiguities'
and contradictions existing in stu
dent government of the form
which caused question as to the
legality of my candidacy. It is
just such vagueness that must be
corrected before student govern
ment can ho transformed from an
impotent farce of imagined power
into a potent force capable of re
alizing its potential influence in
directing university policy and de
cisions.

Better parking, permanent hos

three issues I would actively pro

be to inform off-campus students
of the forthcoming Issues, be
readily available to discuss these
issues, then vigorously promote
the off-campus point of view. |
