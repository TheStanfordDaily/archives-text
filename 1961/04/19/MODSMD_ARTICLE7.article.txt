# Faculty, Buildings and Plant To Get Most PACE Dollars
## 
### 
(EDlTOß’S NOTE: This is the
first of two articles dealing' with
how the $lOO million PACE money
will be spent. The second one will
appear in tomorrows’ Daily.)
New buildings for both aca
demic and nonacademic uses
will sprout on campus as a major
part of detailed plans for use of
the $lOO million the University ex
pects to raise in its three-year
PACE program announced yes
terday.
Among the structures sched
uled to go up are a new Health
Service infirmary, a fine arts
center, a student publications
building and structures for the
Graduate School of Business and
the Graduate School of Mineral
Sciences.
And, of course, the almost
legendary new undergraduate li
brary.
UNDER THE program, several
departments would switch places
on Quad, large lecture rooms
would bo renovated and general
repairs to the Quad would he
taken care of.
Broken down into general areas,
the money will go to: faculty, $2(5
million: student programs, $lO
million; library operations, $6 mil
lion: buildings and plant, $41.5
million; and continuing annual
support during the drive, $16.5 ]
million.
Under terms of the Ford Form- !
dation grant, Stanford must
match each of the $25 million
Ford dollars with three of its own
giving the $lOO million the Uni
versity expects to have by the
time the three-year PACE cam
paign ends.
SINCE THE University plans <
to increase its faculty by 20 peri
cent over the next five years, and
believing the salary structure for l
professors must advance by about
35 per cent, SIS.S million is slated
to go to faculty additions and im- i
proved salaries.
Some $6.5 million will be cur

| marked for direct expenditures
over several years, while the rest
of the money will be added to
general faculty endowment to per
manently bolster the new level of
faculty support.
Declaring “The bulwark of fac
ulty strength lies in permanently
endowed professorships, occupied
I by scholar-teachers of real dis- j
i tinction,” the University says it j
will establish 15 new endowed \
professorships for a total cost of i
$7.5 million. Stanford has only 17 |
currently, and University officials !
j admit “Stanford today is deficient I
j in named endowed chairs.”
STUDENT aid is slated to get [
$7 million in the forms of scholar- j
ships, fellowships, loans and
grants. Some $500,000 will be al- j
| loted to increasing revolving loan !
funds.
The rest will go to “enlarge the |
| scholarship-fellowship program, j
{ on a basis of $4.5 million for en- j
| dowment and $2 million for direct, j
continuing support.”
Special student programs will I
| be given a permanent endowment I
j of $2 million, and another SI mil
| lion for direct expenditure to
| "improve intramural athletics and i
| physical education, to increase the
| number of faculty residences and
j associates in living units, expand
j house libraries and support cul
i tural activities in the new Tresid
! der Union and elsewhere. . . .”
LIBRARY operations not in
cluding the building of the longed
for undergraduate library will
get $4.5 million. Funds will go for
purchasing and handling new i
books and improving service in '
the Main Library and the under-1
j grad libe, through “a combina
tion of term support for immedi-!
! ale improvement ts2 million) and i
: endowment for permanent sup
port ($2.5 million).”
The Hoover Institution will re
| reive $1.5 million $500,000 of it j
to be directly spent over the next
few years to expand the institu

tion's work and $1 million going
to endowment for continuing sup
port.
The humanities and behavioral
sciences are slated for $10,220,000
of the $41.5 million in buildings
and plant money.
JORDAN HALL, the behavioral
sciences building, will be given
j $2.3 million to rebuild it so it can
j house three core departments of
I the behavioral sciences: psychol
ogy, sociology and anthropology.
The Institute for Communica
tions Research and the Depart
| merit of Economics are to be “lo
j catcd either in or near Jordan
j Hall,” the University says.
Cost of the Jordan renovation
i is expected to be $2.8 million, but
j Stanford hopes to land $500,000 of
j the amount from federal grants.
SOME OF (he large Quad class
| rooms “will be modified and pro
{ vided with visual aid equipment
j and other modern devices” at an
j anticipated cost of $250,000.
Other Quad buildings will be re
done to permit double-decking as
in many of the current buildings.
| About $300,000 will go toward this
I project.
The undergraduate library, “de
signed to remove all barriers be
tween the reader and the book,”
will be put up for $4,870,000. A
Daily story later this week will de
scribe in detail how it will look
and operate.
EXPANSION and improvement
of the Main Library is scheduled
for $400,000 of the PACE funds.
A fine arts building will have
J the music, drama and art depart
ments in one building which “will
j bring (he basic creative arts to
| get her for the first time at Stan
| ford,” The University says “PACE
funds will permit construction of
the initial stage of this new' build
ing, to be located close to the
i Dinkelspiel Auditorium in the stu
dent activities area.”
It w ill run about $2.1 million.
