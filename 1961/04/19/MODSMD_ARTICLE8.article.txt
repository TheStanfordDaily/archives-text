# $100 MILLION SU DRIVE
## Sterling Terms Push 'Our Boldest Venture' 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
Stanford yesterday launched a
$lOO million three-year drive to
ward a “peak of excellence’’ in
higher education in what Presi
dent Wallace Sterling termed “our
boldest venture since the Univer
sity was founded.”
The campaign to match the
Ford Foundation grant got off to
a fast start with (he announce
ment that trustee commitments
of more than $3 million, plus 10
other advance gifts, already have
reached $7.4 million.
Kickoff to the big push came at
a luncheon at Lagunita attended
by almost 30 education writers
here for a two-day program ac
quainting them with Stanford and
the reasons behind the unprece
dented drive.
AMONG papers represented are |
The New York Times. Christian I
Science Monitor, Salt Lake City i
Deseret News, Arizona (Phoenix) }
Republic and all San Francisco |
and Los Angeles papers. Writers |
from Newsweek and U.S. News & !
World Report also are covering i
the event.
Sterling told the writers, Uni- j
versity of California President |
Clark Kerr and more than 100 j
alumni, faculty and administra
tion members present “This is our
boldest venture since the Univer
sity was founded.
“I am confident that it will I
write another bright page in the j
history of American higher edu j
cation in a crucially important
period,” he added.
THOMAS P. PIKE, president of
the Board of Trustees, made the
official declaration of the cam
paign’s start, saying it “presents
a magnificent opportunity for
Stanford to attain now greatness.”

He also outlined the way the
drive will be run by volunteers
from the 70,000 Farm alumni
spread around the globe.
Solicitation of the big donations
has already begun, Pike reported,
but organization of the many re
gional campaigns isn’t yet com
pleted.
A SERIES of kickoff dinners
is planned for key cities across
the nation next fall to get the
drive into high gear.
While the Ford Foundation had
given the University five years
to raise the matching funds to its
$25 million gift, Stanford officials
decided to attempt to get the job
done in three.
At a press conference following
the luncheon, Sterling said the de
cision to cut the time to three
years was made for two main
reasons:
• A natural desire to accom
plish the project in the shortest
possible time to meet the urgent
needs and many opportunities fac
ing Stanford, and
• The problem of keeping the
large number of volunteers to
gether and mobilized would be
oasiei 1 to handle in the shorter
period of time.
The University will receive one
dollar for every three it raises on
its own up to $75 million, under
terms of the grant. It started get
ting money when the award was
made last September.
FORMER President Herbert
Hoover, Class of ’95, was named
honorary chairman of the project.
Now living in New York, Hoover
sent the following telegram of
encouragement to the luncheon:
‘‘For seventy years Stanford .. .
has poured out a glorious stream
of youth competent to meet the
needs of our growing country and
our wav of life.
“The' Ford . . . gift of $25,000,-
000 opens a new door of opportu
nity for greater service by Stan
ford.
“Our country needs this ex
panded service.
“I believe the Stanford commu
nity can accomplish this task.
"WE MUST.”

Campaign co-chairmen will ho
trustees James B. Black, chair
man of the board of Pacific Gas
and Electric Co., and Edward R.
Valentine, president of the Robin
son Building Co. of Los Angeles.
Heading the major gifts section
is trustee David Packard, presi
dent of Hewlett-Packard in Palo
Alto and immediate past president
of the Board.
The drive officially has been
dubbed “The Stanford PACE Pro
gram A $lOO Million Plan of
Action for a Challenging Era.”
SPEAKING at the luncheon.
Sterling stated the Ford grant
“has placed Stanford in the grip
of an historic opportunity.”
He emphasized the services
American higher education pro
vides “to the broader society be
yond the campus” and called for
widespread, greater support for
the vital private sector of higher
education.
Noting the $46 million Ford
grant to Stanford and four other
private universities, the president
declared;
“THAT STANFORD received
such a high proportion of the to
tal award is a compliment to its
attainments, an expression of high
confidence in its future, including
its ability to attract the addi
tional $75 million, and a recogni
tion of its strategic position as a
private university in the West—•
one of a scant half dozen in the
western two-thirds of the United
States.”
He examined the special facili
ties of the private university
needed to train the top students
upon whom the nation will draw
for leadership in coming years
which he sees as filled with “op
portunities whose excitement and
importance are in proportion to
the dangers they will overcome.”
KERR pointed out the close tics
between Cal and Stanford and
noted both “have the same goal—-
the advancement of learning.
“Both pursue this goal alike for
its own fascination and for the
sake of the service to society
which they can render thereby,”
he continued.
There are a number of ways in
which a strong private university
can be helpful to public education,
Kerr added, and singled out par
ticularly “the establishing and up
holding of a pattern of independ
ence upon which all universities
can rely.
“THIS KIND of ‘moral sup
port,’ ” he went on, “can be vital
to maintaining the freedom of
thought and discussion so indis
pensable to a university’s per
formance of its functions of teach
ing, research and public service.
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Colum
bia, Stanford have set and still
maintain the standards that in
fluence us all.”
