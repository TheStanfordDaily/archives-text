# PACE to Provide Better Facilities
## 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
second of three articles explain
ing: in detail what Stanford plans
to do with the money it expects
to raise from the three-year
PACE drive.)

In an effort to provide students
and faculty with critically needed
space to work, live and relax in
Stanford plans to spend $41.5 mil
lion of the $lOO million to be
raised in the PACE campaign on
buildings and the University
plant.

Vice Provost Robert Wert said
yesterday that since World War
II “we have applied dollars to peo
ple alone,’’ and that it is time for
Stanford to give its people long
overdue facilities. '

As an example of the “most
critical” space shortage in the
University’s history, Wert pointed
out that there presently is not
enough office space for the new
faculty members coming in the
fall.

THE REASON for this, he said,
is that almost all construction
since 1945 has gone into such
things as dormitories, the post
office, bookstore, Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and so on. There has
been no real work done on class
room and office building, he
noted.

While admitting “the Univer
sity has fallen behind” in such
construction, he underlined the
fact that the PACE dollars will
enable establishment of facilities
needed to carry out the evergrow
ing amount of research, teaching
and administrative work going on.

The funds will mean the Uni
versity can ease the student hous
ing situation and put up the new
fine arts building, a new student
publications building and a new
gymnasium to take basketball
games out of the rickety Pavilion
—among other structures sched
uled for construction.

SPECIFICALLY, the basic sci
ences and engineering will get
$8,045,000 million—of which $2.-
225,000 will go for a new biology
building.
To bo constructed just south of
the chemistry buildings described
in yesterday’s Daily, the new
building will house the teaching
and research operations now cen
tered in Jordan Hall on Outer
Quad.

The University says the money
“will permit expansion into cer
tain areas not now represented in
this department, and strengthen
ing of undergraduate training
with emphasis on more highly in
dividualized instruction.”
TOTAL COST of the new build
ing will be $3.5 million, of which
$1,275,000 will be sought from
federal grants tor construction of
sciences facilities.

Rehabilitation of Hopkins Ma
rine Station 100 miles south of
Stanford in Pacific Grove will
draw $lOO,OOO. Funds provided
under the PACE drive will permit
urgently needed remodeling of
facilities for more effective serv
ice to research and graduate
training.

The physical chemistry building
will receive $700,000 and will
serve as a counterpart to the new

Stauffer Chemistry Building,
which houses organic chemistry
research. “It will resemble . . .

Stauffer . . . and lie just south of
it,” the University «ays.
TOTAL COST of the building is
$1 million, of which $300,000 again
will be asked from federal grants.
As the University officials put
it, “The chemistry library is now
inadequately housed. Renovation
of the front portion of the north
wing of the original (1900) Chem
istry Building will provied a suita
ble library, and mark a stop to
ward badly needed rehabilitation
of this entire building.”

THE REMODELING of the
front part will cost $125,000.
New engineering buildings will
draw $1,675,000 of the PACE dol
lars. The structures will provide
faculty office space, an engineer
ing library, classrooms and re
search activities.

“PACE funds will provide for
the first stage of a major new
building in the Science Quad, just
south of the Physics Lecture Hall,
and for construction of a building
for chemical engineering adja
cent to the new chemistry re
search buildings.

“FIRST STAGE of the new en
gineering building will cost $l,-
650,000 of which $625,000 will be
sought from federal grants . . ,”
according to a University state
ment.

Cost of the chemical engineer
ing building will be $1 million, of
which $350,000 hopefully will
come from federal money.

Rehabilitation of the engineer
ing laboratories is slated to run
about $650,000. The old engineer
ing labs just south of Quad across
from the Union will be remodeled
to serve current needs for both
classroom and research space.

SOLID mechanics, materials
science and the thermosciences
division of mechanical engineer
ing will draw much of the money.
Sections of three high-ceilinged
buildings will be converted into'
three-story structures with base
ments added. The University ex
pects total cost to be $1,350,000,
and will seek $700,000 of it from
federal and foundation grants.
Remaking the Physics Corner
building interior will run to $1.4
million—and the Mathematics De
partment will move to Physics
Corner after the Physics Depart
ment vacates the space by moving
into its new building across the
street.

TOTAL cost should hit $1.9 mil
lion, with $500,000 of it to be
sought from government grants.
A new building will go up on
Lomita Drive across from Geol
ogy Corner to house the School
of Mineral Sciences. It will con
tain additional teaching and re
search laboratories, classrooms,
administrative facilities, and tem
porarily (until permanent quar
ters are provided in a later build
ing) the mineral sciences library
now scattered in 11 different lo
cations.

Expected cost is $1,470,000
$300,000 hopefully to come from
government grants of some kind.

to do with the money it expects
to raise from the three-year
PACE drive.)

In an effort to provide students
and faculty with critically needed
space to work, live and relax in
Stanford plans to spend $41.5 mil
lion of the $lOO million to be
raised in the PACE campaign on
buildings and the University
plant.

Vice Provost Robert Wert said
yesterday that since World War
II “we have applied dollars to peo
ple alone,’’ and that it is time for
Stanford to give its people long
overdue facilities. '

As an example of the “most
critical” space shortage in the
University’s history, Wert pointed
out that there presently is not
enough office space for the new
faculty members coming in the
fall.

THE REASON for this, he said,
is that almost all construction
since 1945 has gone into such
things as dormitories, the post
office, bookstore, Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and so on. There has
been no real work done on class
room and office building, he
noted.

While admitting “the Univer
sity has fallen behind” in such
construction, he underlined the
fact that the PACE dollars will
enable establishment of facilities
needed to carry out the evergrow
ing amount of research, teaching
and administrative work going on.

The funds will mean the Uni
versity can ease the student hous
ing situation and put up the new
fine arts building, a new student
publications building and a new
gymnasium to take basketball
games out of the rickety Pavilion
—among other structures sched
uled for construction.

SPECIFICALLY, the basic sci
ences and engineering will get
$8,045,000 million—of which $2.-
225,000 will go for a new biology
building.
To bo constructed just south of
the chemistry buildings described
in yesterday’s Daily, the new
building will house the teaching
and research operations now cen
tered in Jordan Hall on Outer
Quad.

The University says the money
“will permit expansion into cer
tain areas not now represented in
this department, and strengthen
ing of undergraduate training
with emphasis on more highly in
dividualized instruction.”
TOTAL COST of the new build
ing will be $3.5 million, of which
$1,275,000 will be sought from
federal grants tor construction of
sciences facilities.

Rehabilitation of Hopkins Ma
rine Station 100 miles south of
Stanford in Pacific Grove will
draw $lOO,OOO. Funds provided
under the PACE drive will permit
urgently needed remodeling of
facilities for more effective serv
ice to research and graduate
training.

The physical chemistry building
will receive $700,000 and will
serve as a counterpart to the new

Stauffer Chemistry Building,
which houses organic chemistry
research. “It will resemble . . .

Stauffer . . . and lie just south of
it,” the University «ays.
TOTAL COST of the building is
$1 million, of which $300,000 again
will be asked from federal grants.
As the University officials put
it, “The chemistry library is now
inadequately housed. Renovation
of the front portion of the north
wing of the original (1900) Chem
istry Building will provied a suita
ble library, and mark a stop to
ward badly needed rehabilitation
of this entire building.”

THE REMODELING of the
front part will cost $125,000.
New engineering buildings will
draw $1,675,000 of the PACE dol
lars. The structures will provide
faculty office space, an engineer
ing library, classrooms and re
search activities.

“PACE funds will provide for
the first stage of a major new
building in the Science Quad, just
south of the Physics Lecture Hall,
and for construction of a building
for chemical engineering adja
cent to the new chemistry re
search buildings.

“FIRST STAGE of the new en
gineering building will cost $l,-
650,000 of which $625,000 will be
sought from federal grants . . ,”
according to a University state
ment.

Cost of the chemical engineer
ing building will be $1 million, of
which $350,000 hopefully will
come from federal money.

Rehabilitation of the engineer
ing laboratories is slated to run
about $650,000. The old engineer
ing labs just south of Quad across
from the Union will be remodeled
to serve current needs for both
classroom and research space.

SOLID mechanics, materials
science and the thermosciences
division of mechanical engineer
ing will draw much of the money.
Sections of three high-ceilinged
buildings will be converted into'
three-story structures with base
ments added. The University ex
pects total cost to be $1,350,000,
and will seek $700,000 of it from
federal and foundation grants.
Remaking the Physics Corner
building interior will run to $1.4
million—and the Mathematics De
partment will move to Physics
Corner after the Physics Depart
ment vacates the space by moving
into its new building across the
street.

TOTAL cost should hit $1.9 mil
lion, with $500,000 of it to be
sought from government grants.
A new building will go up on
Lomita Drive across from Geol
ogy Corner to house the School
of Mineral Sciences. It will con
tain additional teaching and re
search laboratories, classrooms,
administrative facilities, and tem
porarily (until permanent quar
ters are provided in a later build
ing) the mineral sciences library
now scattered in 11 different lo
cations.

Expected cost is $1,470,000
$300,000 hopefully to come from
government grants of some kind.

In an effort to provide students
and faculty with critically needed
space to work, live and relax in
Stanford plans to spend $41.5 mil
lion of the $lOO million to be
raised in the PACE campaign on
buildings and the University
plant.

Vice Provost Robert Wert said
yesterday that since World War
II “we have applied dollars to peo
ple alone,’’ and that it is time for
Stanford to give its people long
overdue facilities. '

As an example of the “most
critical” space shortage in the
University’s history, Wert pointed
out that there presently is not
enough office space for the new
faculty members coming in the
fall.

THE REASON for this, he said,
is that almost all construction
since 1945 has gone into such
things as dormitories, the post
office, bookstore, Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and so on. There has
been no real work done on class
room and office building, he
noted.

While admitting “the Univer
sity has fallen behind” in such
construction, he underlined the
fact that the PACE dollars will
enable establishment of facilities
needed to carry out the evergrow
ing amount of research, teaching
and administrative work going on.

The funds will mean the Uni
versity can ease the student hous
ing situation and put up the new
fine arts building, a new student
publications building and a new
gymnasium to take basketball
games out of the rickety Pavilion
—among other structures sched
uled for construction.

SPECIFICALLY, the basic sci
ences and engineering will get
$8,045,000 million—of which $2.-
225,000 will go for a new biology
building.
To bo constructed just south of
the chemistry buildings described
in yesterday’s Daily, the new
building will house the teaching
and research operations now cen
tered in Jordan Hall on Outer
Quad.

The University says the money
“will permit expansion into cer
tain areas not now represented in
this department, and strengthen
ing of undergraduate training
with emphasis on more highly in
dividualized instruction.”
TOTAL COST of the new build
ing will be $3.5 million, of which
$1,275,000 will be sought from
federal grants tor construction of
sciences facilities.

Rehabilitation of Hopkins Ma
rine Station 100 miles south of
Stanford in Pacific Grove will
draw $lOO,OOO. Funds provided
under the PACE drive will permit
urgently needed remodeling of
facilities for more effective serv
ice to research and graduate
training.

The physical chemistry building
will receive $700,000 and will
serve as a counterpart to the new

Stauffer Chemistry Building,
which houses organic chemistry
research. “It will resemble . . .

Stauffer . . . and lie just south of
it,” the University «ays.
TOTAL COST of the building is
$1 million, of which $300,000 again
will be asked from federal grants.
As the University officials put
it, “The chemistry library is now
inadequately housed. Renovation
of the front portion of the north
wing of the original (1900) Chem
istry Building will provied a suita
ble library, and mark a stop to
ward badly needed rehabilitation
of this entire building.”

THE REMODELING of the
front part will cost $125,000.
New engineering buildings will
draw $1,675,000 of the PACE dol
lars. The structures will provide
faculty office space, an engineer
ing library, classrooms and re
search activities.

“PACE funds will provide for
the first stage of a major new
building in the Science Quad, just
south of the Physics Lecture Hall,
and for construction of a building
for chemical engineering adja
cent to the new chemistry re
search buildings.

“FIRST STAGE of the new en
gineering building will cost $l,-
650,000 of which $625,000 will be
sought from federal grants . . ,”
according to a University state
ment.

Cost of the chemical engineer
ing building will be $1 million, of
which $350,000 hopefully will
come from federal money.

Rehabilitation of the engineer
ing laboratories is slated to run
about $650,000. The old engineer
ing labs just south of Quad across
from the Union will be remodeled
to serve current needs for both
classroom and research space.

SOLID mechanics, materials
science and the thermosciences
division of mechanical engineer
ing will draw much of the money.
Sections of three high-ceilinged
buildings will be converted into'
three-story structures with base
ments added. The University ex
pects total cost to be $1,350,000,
and will seek $700,000 of it from
federal and foundation grants.
Remaking the Physics Corner
building interior will run to $1.4
million—and the Mathematics De
partment will move to Physics
Corner after the Physics Depart
ment vacates the space by moving
into its new building across the
street.

TOTAL cost should hit $1.9 mil
lion, with $500,000 of it to be
sought from government grants.
A new building will go up on
Lomita Drive across from Geol
ogy Corner to house the School
of Mineral Sciences. It will con
tain additional teaching and re
search laboratories, classrooms,
administrative facilities, and tem
porarily (until permanent quar
ters are provided in a later build
ing) the mineral sciences library
now scattered in 11 different lo
cations.

Expected cost is $1,470,000
$300,000 hopefully to come from
government grants of some kind.

Stanford plans to spend $41.5 mil
lion of the $lOO million to be
raised in the PACE campaign on
buildings and the University
plant.

Vice Provost Robert Wert said
yesterday that since World War
II “we have applied dollars to peo
ple alone,’’ and that it is time for
Stanford to give its people long
overdue facilities. '

As an example of the “most
critical” space shortage in the
University’s history, Wert pointed
out that there presently is not
enough office space for the new
faculty members coming in the
fall.

THE REASON for this, he said,
is that almost all construction
since 1945 has gone into such
things as dormitories, the post
office, bookstore, Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium and so on. There has
been no real work done on class
room and office building, he
noted.

While admitting “the Univer
sity has fallen behind” in such
construction, he underlined the
fact that the PACE dollars will
enable establishment of facilities
needed to carry out the evergrow
ing amount of research, teaching
and administrative work going on.

The funds will mean the Uni
versity can ease the student hous
ing situation and put up the new
fine arts building, a new student
publications building and a new
gymnasium to take basketball
games out of the rickety Pavilion
—among other structures sched
uled for construction.

SPECIFICALLY, the basic sci
ences and engineering will get
$8,045,000 million—of which $2.-
225,000 will go for a new biology
building.
To bo constructed just south of
the chemistry buildings described
in yesterday’s Daily, the new
building will house the teaching
and research operations now cen
tered in Jordan Hall on Outer
Quad.

The University says the money
“will permit expansion into cer
tain areas not now represented in
this department, and strengthen
ing of undergraduate training
with emphasis on more highly in
dividualized instruction.”
TOTAL COST of the new build
ing will be $3.5 million, of which
$1,275,000 will be sought from
federal grants tor construction of
sciences facilities.

Rehabilitation of Hopkins Ma
rine Station 100 miles south of
Stanford in Pacific Grove will
draw $lOO,OOO. Funds provided
under the PACE drive will permit
urgently needed remodeling of
facilities for more effective serv
ice to research and graduate
training.

The physical chemistry building
will receive $700,000 and will
serve as a counterpart to the new

Stauffer Chemistry Building,
which houses organic chemistry
research. “It will resemble . . .

Stauffer . . . and lie just south of
it,” the University «ays.
TOTAL COST of the building is
$1 million, of which $300,000 again
will be asked from federal grants.
As the University officials put
it, “The chemistry library is now
inadequately housed. Renovation
of the front portion of the north
wing of the original (1900) Chem
istry Building will provied a suita
ble library, and mark a stop to
ward badly needed rehabilitation
of this entire building.”

THE REMODELING of the
front part will cost $125,000.
New engineering buildings will
draw $1,675,000 of the PACE dol
lars. The structures will provide
faculty office space, an engineer
ing library, classrooms and re
search activities.

“PACE funds will provide for
the first stage of a major new
building in the Science Quad, just
south of the Physics Lecture Hall,
and for construction of a building
for chemical engineering adja
cent to the new chemistry re
search buildings.

“FIRST STAGE of the new en
gineering building will cost $l,-
650,000 of which $625,000 will be
sought from federal grants . . ,”
according to a University state
ment.

Cost of the chemical engineer
ing building will be $1 million, of
which $350,000 hopefully will
come from federal money.

Rehabilitation of the engineer
ing laboratories is slated to run
about $650,000. The old engineer
ing labs just south of Quad across
from the Union will be remodeled
to serve current needs for both
classroom and research space.

SOLID mechanics, materials
science and the thermosciences
division of mechanical engineer
ing will draw much of the money.
Sections of three high-ceilinged
buildings will be converted into'
three-story structures with base
ments added. The University ex
pects total cost to be $1,350,000,
and will seek $700,000 of it from
federal and foundation grants.
Remaking the Physics Corner
building interior will run to $1.4
million—and the Mathematics De
partment will move to Physics
Corner after the Physics Depart
ment vacates the space by moving
into its new building across the
street.

TOTAL cost should hit $1.9 mil
lion, with $500,000 of it to be
sought from government grants.
A new building will go up on
Lomita Drive across from Geol
ogy Corner to house the School
of Mineral Sciences. It will con
tain additional teaching and re
search laboratories, classrooms,
administrative facilities, and tem
porarily (until permanent quar
ters are provided in a later build
ing) the mineral sciences library
now scattered in 11 different lo
cations.

Expected cost is $1,470,000
$300,000 hopefully to come from
government grants of some kind.
