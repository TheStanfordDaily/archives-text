# Cuba Rebels Crushed; Troops Scatter to Hills
## Revolutionaries Lack Force, Internal Support 
### United Press International 
Fidel Castro’s Communist-sup
plied armies appeared to have
crushed the last organized force
of invading revolutionaries yes
terday. But the rebel high com
mand said most of the anti-Castro
troops had reached the Escam
bray Mountains to fight on as
guerrillas.
The first organized anti-Castro
offensive ended after 2V2 days of

struggle against Migs, tanks and
artillery.
At 6:015 p.m. PST, a communi
que from the rebel headquarters
outside Cuba described the death
of a valiant beachhead.
CASTRO HIMSELF issued no
immediate victory claim. The gov
ernment radio was silent on the
reported rebel defeat as late as
eight hours after the beachhead
command post abandoned its ra
dio. It seemed likely that intense
military operations were continu
ing and that Castro was person
ally in command.
For the first time, Wednesday
night’s rebel communique de
scribed the assault force as num
bering “in the hundreds, not the
thousands.”
“THE RECENT landings in
Cuba have been constantly,
though inaccurately, described as
an invasion,” Wednesday night's
statement said. “It was, in fact,
a landing mainly of supplies and
support for our patriots who have
been fighting in Cuba for months.
The internal uprising envisioned
by the rebel leaders failed to ma
terialize. That alone doomed the
rebel mission—and Castro’s abil
ity to mount Migs and tanks
against the landing force was the
final blow.
REPORTS filtering back to
rebel leaders in the United States
gave this picture of the final
hours:
The command post on the beach
head apparently had to abandon
its position and its equipment in
cluding the radio transmitter
which blacked out in mid-after
noon.
With rebel vessels at the mercy
of Migs flying continuous high
speed missions over the area, a
Dunkirk-style withdrawal was
impossible.
THE POWER of Castro’s muni
tions and the flat terrain of the
beachhead area seemed to dictate
a bloody fate for any rebels left
behind. At best, they had 30 to
50 miles to cover on foot before
reaching the safety of the Escam
bray Mountains.
These ragged hills already were
virtually under siege by Castro’s
militia. It has been on constant
duty there holding i - ebel guerril
las more or less in siege for
months.
But the loss of the initial beach
head did not at all spell an end
to rebel activity.
IT WAS EXPECTED smaller
scale landing operations would
continue on the order of those
which had previously put com
mando groups ashore to join the
Escambray guerrillas.
The Wednesday evening com
munique took pains to avoid dis
couraging the anti-Castro move
ment within and without Cuba.
MEANWHILE pro-Castor vio
lence flared for the third day
throughout Latin America. Un
confirmed reports said the U.S.
naval attache in Guatemala City
was shot and wounded in one of
the riots.
