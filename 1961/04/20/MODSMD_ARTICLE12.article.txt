# Not Responsible
## 
### 
The time has come when one at
least partially responsible for the
furor over elections should speak,
and nothing prompted it more
than Tuesday’s editorial.
It is generally accepted that leg
islative bodies, under the BroWn
Act, may go into executive ses
sion, and therefore secret session,
if personnel-type problems are to
be considered. This was my under
standing of the meaning of execu
tive session when I asked Legis
lature last Thursday to go into
executive session. I had things to
explain, as my reasons for not
wishing to set up polls at Stern
and Toyon, which I knew would
be personnel-type, and further
which were, in essence, rumor.
While the Brown Act, as you
pointed out in your editorial, does
not apply to a student legislative
body, nonetheless the philosophy
of protecting the innocent and al
lowing personal evaluation, with
out fear of publicity for com
ments made in the session, which
is the philosophy behind the
Brown Act, was evident also in
reason for Legislature going into
executive session last Thursday.
At the time I asked for execu
tive session, I had stated, in open
session, most of my reasons for
opposing these polls. They con
cerned matters of equipment and
supervision. These, which The
Daily thoughtfully neglected to
mention, were my major reasons;
my “main reason” being control
of the Stern-Toyon vote, as Fri
day’s Daily said, is rather far
from being the truth.
In executive session, I stated
that Scotty and Steve had told me
that the candidate involved had
“virtual control” over the Stern-
Toyon vote, but I also said that I
considered this in the realm of
rumor, and that it may or may
not be true.
To further emphasize the lack of
adequate supervision under the
system at that time proposed for
polls in Stern and Toyon, I point
ed out that about 70 votes had
been frauded in fall quarter’s elec
tion. Since the fall election was a
minor one compared to this quar
ter’s election, and since the candi
dates for ASSU president had
been very busy with their cam
paign beginning early in winter
quarter, the possibility of further
fraud in this election was. I felt,
greater. I also said that, since
Election Commission is responsi
ble for the legitimacy of any poll,
and since the Commission mem
bers would already be supervising
five other polls at the times that
the Stern and Toyon polls would
be active, they would not be able
to supervise the additional six
polls, hence I would not be able
to vouch for the legitimacy of the
Stern and Toyon polls. The “ru
mor” that one candidate had “vir
tual control” of these two areas
led me to believe that, under the
system at that time proposed, the
possibility of illegal voting in
these areas would be increased.
Hence I felt it necessary to fight
the resolution on the floor at that
time.

My aim with elections has been
to get as many informed voters as
possible to vote in legal elections.
Sunday, another plan for polls in
these areas was proposed to me,
in which I saw a greatly reduced
possibility of illegality. So I ap
proved the plan, and the six addi
tional polls will be operating after
all.

I have no personal bone to pick
with anyone. Not even responsible
Daily members. But I abhor irre
sponsibility in student officials,
and you, Maynard, qualify as a
student official in two capacities:
you are editor of The Daily, and
you are a Legislature member.
First of all, let's clarify a few
things. Do you remember Sunday,
Maynard, when you admitted to
me that you were "the Legisla
ture member” who "leaked” the
information about executive ses-

sion to the reporter? Do you also
remember what went on in that
session, Maynard? Judging from
the distortions and half-truths ap
pearing in Friday’s Daily, you do
not remember.

Thirdly, Maynard, is it your de
cision to make as to what is good
for the public to know and what
is not? You seem to infer from
the tone of Tuesday’s editorial,
that Legislature, an elected body,
should not be saddled with the re
sponsibility of determining what
the public should know. You are
only one elected member, but evi
dently you feel qualified to be, in
this case, a type of censor, reus
ing to be bound by a majority de
cision of other members of Legis
lature who wish to operate, mo
mentarily, without publicity.
Fourth, to attack Tuesday’s edi
torial directly, the Legislature has
not "shown an unfortunate ten
dency to attempt to go into execu
tive session . . .” recently. If you
will refer to the backlog of min

utes for Legislature meetings for
the year, I dgubt you will find any
other attempts by Legislature to
go into executive session, save the
two attempts last Thursday,
which, incidentally, had justifi
able reasons behind them. If this
reflects a “tendency” I suggest
you look the word up in a good
dictionary. And the inference a
normal person draws from your
comment about "those who like to
do business in private . . is a
rather blatant attack on the re
sponsible members of Legislature.
Remember, too. Maynard, that
I have worked with you on The
Daily and am thoroughly ac
quainted with Daily problems and
and policies. I have watched your
lack of responsibility grow with
each time you worked on desk. I
suggest, therefore, that, combined
with the evidence cited above, you
are not responsible enough to hold
down the position of editor of the
campus newspaper.

Sunday, another plan for polls in
these areas was proposed to me,
in which I saw a greatly reduced
possibility of illegality. So I ap
proved the plan, and the six addi
tional polls will be operating after
all.

I have no personal bone to pick
with anyone. Not even responsible
Daily members. But I abhor irre
sponsibility in student officials,
and you, Maynard, qualify as a
student official in two capacities:
you are editor of The Daily, and
you are a Legislature member.
First of all, let's clarify a few
things. Do you remember Sunday,
Maynard, when you admitted to
me that you were "the Legisla
ture member” who "leaked” the
information about executive ses-

sion to the reporter? Do you also
remember what went on in that
session, Maynard? Judging from
the distortions and half-truths ap
pearing in Friday’s Daily, you do
not remember.

Thirdly, Maynard, is it your de
cision to make as to what is good
for the public to know and what
is not? You seem to infer from
the tone of Tuesday’s editorial,
that Legislature, an elected body,
should not be saddled with the re
sponsibility of determining what
the public should know. You are
only one elected member, but evi
dently you feel qualified to be, in
this case, a type of censor, reus
ing to be bound by a majority de
cision of other members of Legis
lature who wish to operate, mo
mentarily, without publicity.
Fourth, to attack Tuesday’s edi
torial directly, the Legislature has
not "shown an unfortunate ten
dency to attempt to go into execu
tive session . . .” recently. If you
will refer to the backlog of min

utes for Legislature meetings for
the year, I dgubt you will find any
other attempts by Legislature to
go into executive session, save the
two attempts last Thursday,
which, incidentally, had justifi
able reasons behind them. If this
reflects a “tendency” I suggest
you look the word up in a good
dictionary. And the inference a
normal person draws from your
comment about "those who like to
do business in private . . is a
rather blatant attack on the re
sponsible members of Legislature.
Remember, too. Maynard, that
I have worked with you on The
Daily and am thoroughly ac
quainted with Daily problems and
and policies. I have watched your
lack of responsibility grow with
each time you worked on desk. I
suggest, therefore, that, combined
with the evidence cited above, you
are not responsible enough to hold
down the position of editor of the
campus newspaper.
ELNA RODENHOUSE
Elections Commission
Chairman
The time has come when one at
least partially responsible for the
furor over elections should speak,
and nothing prompted it more
than Tuesday’s editorial.
It is generally accepted that leg
islative bodies, under the BroWn
Act, may go into executive ses
sion, and therefore secret session,
if personnel-type problems are to
be considered. This was my under
standing of the meaning of execu
tive session when I asked Legis
lature last Thursday to go into
executive session. I had things to
explain, as my reasons for not
wishing to set up polls at Stern
and Toyon, which I knew would
be personnel-type, and further
which were, in essence, rumor.
While the Brown Act, as you
pointed out in your editorial, does
not apply to a student legislative
body, nonetheless the philosophy
of protecting the innocent and al
lowing personal evaluation, with
out fear of publicity for com
ments made in the session, which
is the philosophy behind the
Brown Act, was evident also in
reason for Legislature going into
executive session last Thursday.
At the time I asked for execu
tive session, I had stated, in open
session, most of my reasons for
opposing these polls. They con
cerned matters of equipment and
supervision. These, which The
Daily thoughtfully neglected to
mention, were my major reasons;
my “main reason” being control
of the Stern-Toyon vote, as Fri
day’s Daily said, is rather far
from being the truth.
In executive session, I stated
that Scotty and Steve had told me
that the candidate involved had
“virtual control” over the Stern-
Toyon vote, but I also said that I
considered this in the realm of
rumor, and that it may or may
not be true.
To further emphasize the lack of
adequate supervision under the
system at that time proposed for
polls in Stern and Toyon, I point
ed out that about 70 votes had
been frauded in fall quarter’s elec
tion. Since the fall election was a
minor one compared to this quar
ter’s election, and since the candi
dates for ASSU president had
been very busy with their cam
paign beginning early in winter
quarter, the possibility of further
fraud in this election was. I felt,
greater. I also said that, since
Election Commission is responsi
ble for the legitimacy of any poll,
and since the Commission mem
bers would already be supervising
five other polls at the times that
the Stern and Toyon polls would
be active, they would not be able
to supervise the additional six
polls, hence I would not be able
to vouch for the legitimacy of the
Stern and Toyon polls. The “ru
mor” that one candidate had “vir
tual control” of these two areas
led me to believe that, under the
system at that time proposed, the
possibility of illegal voting in
these areas would be increased.
Hence I felt it necessary to fight
the resolution on the floor at that
time.

to get as many informed voters as
possible to vote in legal elections.

standing of the meaning of execu
tive session when I asked Legis
lature last Thursday to go into
executive session. I had things to
explain, as my reasons for not
wishing to set up polls at Stern
and Toyon, which I knew would
be personnel-type, and further
which were, in essence, rumor.
While the Brown Act, as you
pointed out in your editorial, does
not apply to a student legislative
body, nonetheless the philosophy
of protecting the innocent and al
lowing personal evaluation, with
out fear of publicity for com
ments made in the session, which
is the philosophy behind the
Brown Act, was evident also in
reason for Legislature going into
executive session last Thursday.
At the time I asked for execu
tive session, I had stated, in open
session, most of my reasons for
opposing these polls. They con
cerned matters of equipment and
supervision. These, which The
Daily thoughtfully neglected to
mention, were my major reasons;
my “main reason” being control
of the Stern-Toyon vote, as Fri
day’s Daily said, is rather far
from being the truth.
In executive session, I stated
that Scotty and Steve had told me
that the candidate involved had
“virtual control” over the Stern-
Toyon vote, but I also said that I
considered this in the realm of
rumor, and that it may or may
not be true.
To further emphasize the lack of
adequate supervision under the
system at that time proposed for
polls in Stern and Toyon, I point
ed out that about 70 votes had
been frauded in fall quarter’s elec
tion. Since the fall election was a
minor one compared to this quar
ter’s election, and since the candi
dates for ASSU president had
been very busy with their cam
paign beginning early in winter
quarter, the possibility of further
fraud in this election was. I felt,
greater. I also said that, since
Election Commission is responsi
ble for the legitimacy of any poll,
and since the Commission mem
bers would already be supervising
five other polls at the times that
the Stern and Toyon polls would
be active, they would not be able
to supervise the additional six
polls, hence I would not be able
to vouch for the legitimacy of the
Stern and Toyon polls. The “ru
mor” that one candidate had “vir
tual control” of these two areas
led me to believe that, under the
system at that time proposed, the
possibility of illegal voting in
these areas would be increased.
Hence I felt it necessary to fight
the resolution on the floor at that
time.

My aim with elections has been
to get as many informed voters as
possible to vote in legal elections.
Sunday, another plan for polls in
these areas was proposed to me,
in which I saw a greatly reduced
possibility of illegality. So I ap
proved the plan, and the six addi
tional polls will be operating after
all.

I have no personal bone to pick
with anyone. Not even responsible
Daily members. But I abhor irre
sponsibility in student officials,
and you, Maynard, qualify as a
student official in two capacities:
you are editor of The Daily, and
you are a Legislature member.
First of all, let's clarify a few
things. Do you remember Sunday,
Maynard, when you admitted to
me that you were "the Legisla
ture member” who "leaked” the
information about executive ses-

sion to the reporter? Do you also
remember what went on in that
session, Maynard? Judging from
the distortions and half-truths ap
pearing in Friday’s Daily, you do
not remember.

Thirdly, Maynard, is it your de
cision to make as to what is good
for the public to know and what
is not? You seem to infer from
the tone of Tuesday’s editorial,
that Legislature, an elected body,
should not be saddled with the re
sponsibility of determining what
the public should know. You are
only one elected member, but evi
dently you feel qualified to be, in
this case, a type of censor, reus
ing to be bound by a majority de
cision of other members of Legis
lature who wish to operate, mo
mentarily, without publicity.
Fourth, to attack Tuesday’s edi
torial directly, the Legislature has
not "shown an unfortunate ten
dency to attempt to go into execu
tive session . . .” recently. If you
will refer to the backlog of min

utes for Legislature meetings for
the year, I dgubt you will find any
other attempts by Legislature to
go into executive session, save the
two attempts last Thursday,
which, incidentally, had justifi
able reasons behind them. If this
reflects a “tendency” I suggest
you look the word up in a good
dictionary. And the inference a
normal person draws from your
comment about "those who like to
do business in private . . is a
rather blatant attack on the re
sponsible members of Legislature.
Remember, too. Maynard, that
I have worked with you on The
Daily and am thoroughly ac
quainted with Daily problems and
and policies. I have watched your
lack of responsibility grow with
each time you worked on desk. I
suggest, therefore, that, combined
with the evidence cited above, you
are not responsible enough to hold
down the position of editor of the
campus newspaper.
