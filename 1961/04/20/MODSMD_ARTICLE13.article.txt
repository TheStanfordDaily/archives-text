# On Greenberg
## 
### 
A fow days ago it seemed quite
apparent to even the most casual
observer that it was the intent of
your sheet to back the candidacy
of Mr. Chickering in this election.
With the printing of Mr. Barry
Greenberg’s article in this morn
ing’s Daily your intent has be
come pointedly obvious.
In his article your inarticulate
but well meaning predecessor did
his best to mock the ideas and
platforms of the two best quali
fied and most thoughtful candi
dates in this election, Bob Sayler
and Bob Mathewson. He blandly
assumes that because he said in
the previous day’s Daily that a
presiding officer of Legislature
cannot present his ideas to that
body, that the statement is true.
I suggest Mr. Greenberg watch
Larry Royse in action and see if
his ideas are not put over to the
LASSU.
Mr. Greenberg charitably de
votes an entire paragraph of your
precious space to a comment on
Bob Mathewson’s campaign plat
form. It is quite obvious to any
one who has read Bob’s campaign
material that Mr. Greenberg has
not. Mathew’son offers no pana
ceas as does the eloquent but
thoughtless Mr. Chickering. In
stead he has analyzed the prob
lems that exist with student gov
ernment and has offered some
proposals and allows that others
must be taken under careful
study. He recognizes the existence
of the ASSU Constitution, which
Chickering and McGee do not
when they say that the president
would not serve on LASSU, and
promises to live within its frame
work and not outside of it.

Mathewson has recognized the
most pressing problem confront
ing ASSU organization, lack of
communication with the student
body. This, by the way, is some
thing no other candidate with all
the “brain trusts” that they have,
has been able to come up with.
His proposals to better communi
cation by appointing a good pub
lic relations assistant and by com
municating regularly through
The Daily merit some considera
tion by the voters, if not by your
honorable sheet.
No other candidate has recog
nized the drain on ASSU man
power that the foreign campuses
represent. Mathewson’s proposals
regarding barnstorming the fresh
men to get them really interested
in student government is a con
structive proposal, but perhaps
Greenberg was too busy to read
to page three of Bob’s informa
tion pamphlet.
An there’s the old saying,
“Everybody talks about Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard
and Judicial Council, but nobody
does anything about them.” Did
Mr. Greenberg bother to read to
page four where Mathewson sets
out five specific proposals regard
ing the strengthing of the Ju
dicial Council through carefully
presented publicity, and better
intra-communication between
Council and Fundamental Stand
ard and Honor Code Commission?
In conclusion, I would suggest
that if you want to endorse a can
didate you do so positively (or do
you fear that that would be the
kiss of death?) and not do it by
going to any length of ignorance
to strike at the obviously well
qualified and well prepared ef
forts of his opponents. I only hope
that the student body pays as lit
tle attention to your attempts as
they seem to pay to your edi
torials. Why don’t you get
Messrs. Cutter and Stewart to
work for you? Their contribu
tion on Monday was the best thing
you’ve printed since you have
been editor.
