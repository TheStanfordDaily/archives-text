# New Flag
## 
### 
One hears it said, with some
justification, that the University
lives largely in the past. I would
to be the last to deny this. Speak
ing for myself, I must confess
that I have little professional con
cern for anything that has hap
pened since about A.D. 150.
But now and then one discovers
indications that the University
lives more in the past than we
realize. I was walking along the
other day, and I happened to
glance casually at the flag whip
ping in the breeze in front of the
Post Office. I want you to under
stand that it is not my habit to
scrutinize carefully every flag I
see, but this one looked odd some
how, and a second look showed
that it had 48 stars.
Now this a curious turn of af
fairs. Why has the University not
officially recognized the fact that
the Union now has 50 states?
Surely our American historians
are not suspicious of the historic
ity of such recent occurrences.
Surely our political scientists
have not intervened to prevent
Stanfordâ€™s recognizing the admis
sion of Alaska and Hawaii. Why
then are we still flying a 48-star
flag?
Perhaps it is this neo-conserv
atism of which we hear so much.
Are the conservatives conspiring
to turn back the clock? Are they
so opposed to progress that they
will not let us even fly the proper
flag? That would be an irony past
believing. Or is it the fault of the
Post Office Department? But the
party in power claims the praise
for having Alaska and Hawaii ad
mitted.
Maybe all w r e need Is 75 million
dollars.
