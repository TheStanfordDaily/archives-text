# Apathetic
## 
### 
Some of the candidates for stu
dent government offices have
adopted the attitude that the elec
tions are unquestionably right,
and that anyone who does not
vote is an apathetic dullard. I
would like to correct this miscon
ception and propose an alterna
tive to student government.
Government has its place, but
when it becomes duplicated and
inefficient as at Stanford, there
is no longer any justification for
it except that it educates us in the
democratic processes. In ele
mentary school we elected class
officers under the smiling, pater
nal guidance of principal and
teacher because it taught us about
our w'onderful democratic heri
tage. Our elections at Stanford
are little more than a habit ac
quired in secondary schools, and
they accomplish nothing that my
fifth grade elections did not do.
And while we look down our
noses with disapproval at Com
munistâ€™s youth rallies, we are es
sentially doing the same thing:
having a democratic youth rally.
We are not, of course, organized
in our meetings to the same de
gree as the Communists, and no
one sets down the purpose of our
elections for us to follow. They
are almost spontaneous, a product
of our culture, but the similarity
with the Communists does exist,
for all organized civilizations need
to arouse favorable opinion for
their governments, whether by
fair means or foul.
Our student government does
nothing that the University ad

ministration could not do except
give a few students popularity
that they do not deserve and ad
vance their future business ca
reers by adding an office to their
records. Many people argue that
student government provides a
link between the administration
and faculty and the students, but
if we all devoted the energies that
we give to the present elections
to the neglected faculty associate
program, a much more effective
and personal link would be estab
lished.
In conclusion, I am not con
demning student government in
itself, for it is beneficial to the
minority that is Interested. But
the present trend of opinion that
student government is the only
way and that something is wrong
with those who do not participate
in elections must stop. Once a so
cial pressure for participation in
meaningless elections develops,
there will be even less difference
between them and Communist
youth rallies.
