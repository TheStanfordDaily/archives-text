## Court Fight Wins Back Teachers' Credentials 
### 
After an eight-year fight, two
California teachers finally got
their credentials back last week.

John W. Maas, an English
teacher at San Francisco City Col
lege. was fired by the San Fran
cisco Board of Education without
a hearing when he refused to tes
tify at a House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee hearing in
1953.

A HIGHLY competent teacher
spent eight years in a variety of
jobs while he fought his case to
the State Supreme Court. In the
meantime, his credential expired.

Tillman Erb, who also took the
Fifth Amendment before the
Committee, was not allowed to
answer questions pertaining only
to himself. When he had finished
his teaching term at Campbell
High School, in Santa Clara Coun
ty, his request for a renewal of
his state teaching credential was
denied.
The State Board restored their
credentials last week after Dep
uty Attorney General Mayers
ruled that the board could not,
under the United States Consti-

tution, withhold credentials “sole
ly because the individuals invoked
the privilege against self-incrimi
nation (Fifth Amendment) in a
federa) proceeding.’’

THEY WERE fired under the
terms of the Dillworth Act. which
requires the dismissal of any
teacher who refuses to answer
political questions put by legis
lative committees or boards of
education.

The constitutionality of (his law
Is highly doubtful.
The State Supreme Court has
said that, it violates due process in
penalizing the exercise of a con
stitutional right, but the law'has
been construed so that only re
fusals based on an unjustified
use( whatever that means) of the
Fifth Amendment privilege vio
late it.
In these two cases, however, no
one even bothered to find out
about a justified or unjustified
use of Fifth. Neither was given a
hearing by his local board.
In anouncing the State board
decision to restore the credentials,
member Raymond Daba said,
“We may be accused of being tol
erant toward Communism, but
this is absolutely not so.
“WE HAVE to keep this thing
in proper perspective. Teachers
have the same constitutional
rights as all citizens.’’ Which is a
step in the right direction.
Whether these men will be re
instated in their jobs is another
question.
Local school boards seem to per
sist in thinking that people sub
poenaed, mentioned, or other
ways slandered by the HUAC are
guilty of “unprofessional conduct
and evident unfitness” to teach.
And if they have refused to an
swer questions, then this is even
more obviously true.
In the meantime, California suf
fers from a great lack of teachers.
Many excellent and gifted people
cannot get jobs with the public
school system because they stood
on a constitutional right. Others
with challenging different
thoughts are scared away from
teaching entirely.
AXD THOSE who do hold posi
tions are bound to have their

thinking somewhat altered. They
may avoid stimulating and contro
versial (but perhaps subversive)
thoughts. And they may, in turn,
produce rather unthinking stu
dents.
What right does the HIT AC
have to demand that all leaching
be from their point of view?
Felix Frankfurter said in 1952,

“Teachers must fulfill their func
tions by precepts and practice.
By the very atmosphere which
they generate, they must be ex
emplars of open-mindedness and
free inquiry. They cannot carry
out their great and noble task if
the conditions for the practice of
a responsible and critical mind
are denied them.”
