It seems that the hoys who do the football scheduling over at
Berkeley have changed their theme song from “The Dirty Golden
Bear” (or whatever it is) to one they must have picked up from Al
fred E. Neuman. Namely “What, Me Worry?”
THE I.IST TELLING where and against whom Cal will he playing
football next year has just arrived and you really have to be eased

into it to keep from going into
hysterics. Though we have never
been any great shakes at pre
dicting football (you might even
say wo were lousy shakes) we
would like to be the first to pre
dict that Cal will win the 1961
“Effigy” (Western Division) for
having the worst season on the
Coast.
We’re playing it safe by not
picking the Golden Bears to cop
national honors in the “Effigy”
derby, although with a few breaks
of the variety that Stanford ex
perienced this past year, Cal could
go all the way.
Here's the way Cal's football
schedule shapes up next year
(easy now; we warned you):
ON SEPT. 23 the University of
Texas comes to Strawberry Can
yon to beat Marv Levy’s charges
by, oh, say, 20 points. The Long-

horns finished with a 7-2 mark last year. Then, a week later the
Golden Ones travel 1.500 miles to meet Big 10 competition. lowa.
Not .just Purdue or Michigan or Illinois, you understand, but lowa.

On fo lowa

Now the Hawkeyes went 8-1 for the season last year and wore, to
our way of thinking, the best team in the Big 10. Better than Min
nesota who beat them 27-10. Had they played up to the potential they
showed against Ohio State and most of the other teams they heat
last year they would have beaten the Gophers. Also they would have
done better than Minnesota did against Washington in the Rose
Bowl. Be that as it may. lowa is big and fast and deep and will be
the team to beat in the Big 10 next year and they will pulverize Cal.
All right, then having had a taste of life in the country whore
football is away of life, the Bears travel to meet Missouri; only the
best team in the country last year. Missouri finished with a 10-1
mark last year including an Orange Bowl win over Navy. To say
more would be rubbing it in.
BACK TO BERKELEY now and the Brother Bear gets to take it
easy with a little conference action; breathers if you will. But we
fear they may be breathing fairly hard with back to back games
with Washington and Southern Cal. Rots of ruck, Marv.
Back East we follow the by now limping Californians as they
meet Penn State. The Pennsylvanians were 6-3 yast year. Go get ’em
Bears. Down south for UCLA, up north for the Air Force— whose
teams run in cycles and whose cycle should be on the upswing—and
then—get this now—Kansas.
Kansas was at 7-2-1 last year and one of the country’s best. And
they were a year away. Now their year will have come; they will
be rated at the top in the pre-season polls and they won’t be about
to let Cal get close.

And What About Big Game?

ALL THIS LEADS UP to Big Game. Now we’d hate to appear
overly optimistic and, never having seen Stanford win a Big Game,
perhaps it would be foolish for us to say that next year is going
to be different.
But consider:
1. Cal will be fucky to get 11 or 12 players down here by Nov.
25 after all they’ve been through.
2. Stanford will have been resting and waiting for the Big One
on such pushovers as Tulane, Michigan State (whoops), San Jose
and all the various ex-members of the old Pacific Coast Conference.
3. Next year is going to be different.
