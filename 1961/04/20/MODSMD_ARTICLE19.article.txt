## Cards Set for Battle 
### KEN DERY Sports Editor 
The big day is coming and the
Stanford track team, although
terribly out manned, refuses to
give in without a real battle.
Saturday is the hig day when '
talent-loaded USC and Oregon in

vade Stanford Stadium for a tri
angular and triple-dual meet.
Starting time is 1:30 p.m.
SUCH stalwarts as Rich Klier,
Don Bell, Dave Weill and Art
Batchelder are all preparing them
selves for the toughest competi
tion of their lives and arc cer
tainly going to try to steal some
points.
Coach Payton Jordan said yes
terday, “This is potentially one of
the finest meets in the history of
the sport. It has attracted nation
wide attention and an Oregon ra
dio station has sent down one of
its men for a direct broadcast. It
should really be something to
see.’’
While the Cards are given no
chance of winning the meet, some
of their performances may have
a great bearing on the outcome
between the Trojans and the
Ducks, the top two teams in the
country.
Co-captain Klier is highly re
garded in the 880 although he does
not hold the fastest comparative
time of the entrants. “He has a
lot of courage,” remarked Jordan,
“and they'll have to heat him to
win it.”
BULL AND Weill will have the
NCAA record holder, Jim Wade

of SC, to contend with in the dis
cus, but may pick up valuable
points just the same.
Batchelder, the fine javelin
thrower, will need the toss of his
life to win, but he has already
gone as well as 233-3.
PERHAPS the only Indian who
could he considered a favorite in
his event is smooth-striding Dan
Moore, in the broadjump.
Moore, a 6-2 1 2, 175-pound soph
omore from Salem, Oregon, was
brilliant last weekend against
UCLA with a jump of 25-1.
“He has not reached his maxi
mum by a long shot and he is

looking better all the time,” said
Coach Jordan. "He’s going to be
awfully tough to beat.”

STANFORD DISCUS THROWER DAVE WEILL
Card cinderman will be out to better his season’s best of
170¾ Saturday against USC and Oregon.
The big day is coming and the
Stanford track team, although
terribly out manned, refuses to
give in without a real battle.
Saturday is the hig day when '
talent-loaded USC and Oregon in

vade Stanford Stadium for a tri
angular and triple-dual meet.
Starting time is 1:30 p.m.
SUCH stalwarts as Rich Klier,
Don Bell, Dave Weill and Art
Batchelder are all preparing them
selves for the toughest competi
tion of their lives and arc cer
tainly going to try to steal some
points.
Coach Payton Jordan said yes
terday, “This is potentially one of
the finest meets in the history of
the sport. It has attracted nation
wide attention and an Oregon ra
dio station has sent down one of
its men for a direct broadcast. It
should really be something to
see.’’
While the Cards are given no
chance of winning the meet, some
of their performances may have
a great bearing on the outcome
between the Trojans and the
Ducks, the top two teams in the
country.
Co-captain Klier is highly re
garded in the 880 although he does
not hold the fastest comparative
time of the entrants. “He has a
lot of courage,” remarked Jordan,
“and they'll have to heat him to
win it.”
BULL AND Weill will have the
NCAA record holder, Jim Wade

of SC, to contend with in the dis
cus, but may pick up valuable
points just the same.
Batchelder, the fine javelin
thrower, will need the toss of his
life to win, but he has already
gone as well as 233-3.
PERHAPS the only Indian who
could he considered a favorite in
his event is smooth-striding Dan
Moore, in the broadjump.
Moore, a 6-2 1 2, 175-pound soph
omore from Salem, Oregon, was
brilliant last weekend against
UCLA with a jump of 25-1.
“He has not reached his maxi
mum by a long shot and he is

looking better all the time,” said
Coach Jordan. "He’s going to be
awfully tough to beat.”
