# Panel Opposes Cuban Invasion
## 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN JIM McDOWELL 
The recent Cuban invasion
“was worse than a crime; it was
a folly,” stated Dr. Paul Baran.
Stanford economics professor
who recently visited Cuba.
He spoke last night with the
lIR-sponsored panel of speakers
from Europe. Asia, Africa and
Latin America reflecting interna
tional opinions on the recent in
vasion of Cuba.

If the United States supported
the Cuban invasion, leaders of
Latin American countries would
have to adopt an extreme position
to avert rebellions, said Martin
Travis and Raymond D. Higgins
of the “Hispanic American Re
port,” using the Rojas govern
ment of Mexico as aih example.
THE DIRECTOR of the His
panic American Report, Ronald
Hilton, felt it is the duty of the
universities in the United States
to suport the active study and
understanding of Latin America.
“The United States has played a
major role in supporting the
Cuban revolution,” read a state
ment by 15 Latin American stu
dents, which asserted that some
of the planes shot down in Cuba
had places of origin outside of
Cuba.
“THE FRENCH would feel that
the Cubans have the total right of
owning their own economy,”
stated Maurice Baasin, and added,
“some Americans do not realize
that the era of decolonization has
come.”

“American prestige in France
is now at a very, very low point.;’
American talk of idealistic
plans such as the New Frontier
and the Peace Corps “seem very
hollow’’ compared with American
policies toward Cuba, said Adrian
Zeideman, a representative of
England.
“I AM FOR Latin America;
therefore I am for Castro,” was
the opinion of Stclio Careasquel.
•from Venezuela. He continued
that the Venezuelan government
backs Castro but is not support
ing him because of political rea
sons.

Dale Johnson reported of yes
terday's San Francisco student
demonstration against the al
ledgedly U.S. supported invasion,
"They were an angry bunch of
students.” The several thousand
students from colleges in the area
formed a sit-down blockade on the
steps of the Federal Building, pre
venting the entrance of last-min
ute income tax payers.
Johnson continued that the pur
pose of the demonstration was to
prevent additional dollars from
going to the United Slates govern
ment which would be used for
rebel support.
