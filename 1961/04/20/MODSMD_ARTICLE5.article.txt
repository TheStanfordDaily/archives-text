# DESIGN IN THEATER'
## New Art Gallery Exhibit Lauded 
### MARY LOU McKINLEY 
Through striking photographs,
costume sketches and movable
models, the Stanford Players’ “De
sign in Theater” exhibit, currently
on display at the Art Gallery,
should add considerable to the
enjoyment of any theater goer.
The extremely well-done, fasci
nating exhibit explains and ex
amines four of the major quali
ties of good theatrical design in
terms anyone can understand.
AS STATED in theexhibit’s bro
chure, theatrical designers “as
sist the audience’s perception of
the play and intensify the intel
lectual and emotional content of
the performance” through visual
means means which the exhibit
presents in detail.
The first section of the display
demonstrates how attention can
he focused on the dramatic action
through brightness and color con

trast in lighting and linear com
position in the set design.
A GROUP of actor-figures is
separated from the background,
and. then, an individual is sepa
rated from the group solely by
light which changes in color and
intensity in a hand-operated
model.
Another movable model demon
strates the quality of expressly-• i
ness which can be achieved
through lighting; here, the scene
changes from one having a soft,
diffuse quality to one illuminated
by a hard, shadow - producing
light. The model also shows the
eerie effects produced by directing
light upward on the scene.
COSTUME sketches, pictures of
stage settings and floor plans of j
movement also explain the prin-1
ciple of expressiveness through
image association, symbolism,
movement, mass and color.

The third important quality of
theater design is explained in a
series of whimsical cartoons
which show how impractical scen
ery and costumes can affect the
movement of the actor.
THE I.AST quality examined in
the exhibit is environmental in
formation as presented through
selecting from, and then simpli
fying, reality.
A striking model in the center
of the exhibit illustrates the
change from 19th Century, real
istically accurate stage design
which used flat scenery, to the
current trend toward merely sug
gesting a certain setting through
form and line.
On display until April 30 at the
Art Gallery, “Design in Theater”
is a “must” for any person with
even the most casual interest in
the stage. The gallery is open
daily, excluding Mondays, from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
