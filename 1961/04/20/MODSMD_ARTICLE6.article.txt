# Large Vote Cast First Day at Polls
## 
### 
Results of the first day of pri
mary elections indicated that in
terest is running high in the con
test for ASSU offices. Over - 25 per
cent of the student body, 2,105
students, voted yesterday, in con
trast to the normal 12-18 per cent
that voted on the first day.
The men seem to be more in
terested than usual since 1,568
men voted, with only 537 women
voting. Normally more women
vote in proportion to their num
bers than men, according to Elna
Rodenhouse, Elections Committee
chairman.
VOTING WILL continue today
until 3:15 p.m. when the last poles
close. Polls will be open at Engi
neering Corner and the Post Of
fice from 8:45 to 3:15; at Physics
Lecture Hall from 9 to 1; in front
of Law School from 10 to 1, and
at Toyon, Stern and on the Row
11:45 to 1:15.
The poll at Encina Store was
eliminated because of the poor
turn-out there.
Vote-counting will begin at 3:30
with running totals posted on the

board outside of the ASSU Office.
Results are expected to be ob
tained before 7 p.m„ stated Chair
man Rodenhouse.
A NEW write-in candidate run
ning for Class of ’63 president is
Tony DeLollis. He is opposing the
nominated candidate John Mc-
Carthy and Ted Striggles, also a
write-in candidate.
Although Striggles has been ac
cepted at the Florence campus for
next fall, he will not go if elected,
since the constitution states that
an elected candidate may not go
to a foreign campus, according to
Striggles.
When ho announced his candi
dacy, Striggles did not know of
this ruling, but hoped to organize
his ex-com during the summer
and allow them to run themselves
in his absence. Although the con
stitution necessitates his presence
here, if elected, Striggles plans to
operate approximately according
to his original plan, that is, organ
ize his ex-com during the summer
so well that, the members could
run themselves.

DeLILLIS is running on the
platform that class government
should act as “a source of two
way communication between our
class and the officers of the Leg
islature with the class president
as a liaison.”
He stated, “With interested and
sincere executive committee mem
bers from every sophomore living
group, I can collect and compile
the interests and opinions of our
class and lobby for them in the
Legislature and the office of the
ASSU president.”
DeLillis also would work for ad
mission of the class presidents to
Legislature.
At Legislature tomorrow Miss
Roden house will recommend that
the poll on the Row be eliminated
and that the number of polls in
Stern be cut from 4 to 2 for the
final elections because of insuffi
cient turn-out. The poll in Toyon,
in contrast, had a lai’ge enough
turn-out to warrant opening it
during the finals.
Finalists will meet Sunday
night at Wilbur in a “great de
bate" sponsored by Dean Hill,
present Wilbur representative to
Legislature.

ASSU candidates who wish
their pictures returned may
pick them up at the Daily
Shack.

A NEW write-in candidate run
ning for Class of ’63 president is
Tony DeLollis. He is opposing the
nominated candidate John Mc-
Carthy and Ted Striggles, also a
write-in candidate.
Although Striggles has been ac
cepted at the Florence campus for
next fall, he will not go if elected,
since the constitution states that
an elected candidate may not go
to a foreign campus, according to
Striggles.
When ho announced his candi
dacy, Striggles did not know of
this ruling, but hoped to organize
his ex-com during the summer
and allow them to run themselves
in his absence. Although the con
stitution necessitates his presence
here, if elected, Striggles plans to
operate approximately according
to his original plan, that is, organ
ize his ex-com during the summer
so well that, the members could
run themselves.

DeLILLIS is running on the
platform that class government
should act as “a source of two
way communication between our
class and the officers of the Leg
islature with the class president
as a liaison.”
He stated, “With interested and
sincere executive committee mem
bers from every sophomore living
group, I can collect and compile
the interests and opinions of our
class and lobby for them in the
Legislature and the office of the
ASSU president.”
DeLillis also would work for ad
mission of the class presidents to
Legislature.
At Legislature tomorrow Miss
Roden house will recommend that
the poll on the Row be eliminated
and that the number of polls in
Stern be cut from 4 to 2 for the
final elections because of insuffi
cient turn-out. The poll in Toyon,
in contrast, had a lai’ge enough
turn-out to warrant opening it
during the finals.
Finalists will meet Sunday
night at Wilbur in a “great de
bate" sponsored by Dean Hill,
present Wilbur representative to
Legislature.
