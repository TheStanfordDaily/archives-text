witnesses Ed Heinlein, Helen Har
ris, Joan Jones and Bill Bush will
testify to the facts.
The witnesses have seen a film
showing Miss Fell’s (Diane Fos
ter’s) fall in the Manlock Shoe
Salon. At issue is the negligence
of the salon and the contributory
negligence of Miss Fell.
JURORS ARE Fred Hodder,
Ted Cranston, Bill Borland, Ralph
Gilman, Michael Owen, Cathy
Wyler, Myron Peterson, Creescy
Wallace, Margaret Arkush, Judy
Levin, Phil Crabtree and Linda

The trial, with a recess at lunch,
is expected to last until about
4:30. Attorneys have already filed
the complaint and an answer and
have held a pre-trial conference
with the judge to determine the
issues to be presented to the jury
at the opening of the trial.
