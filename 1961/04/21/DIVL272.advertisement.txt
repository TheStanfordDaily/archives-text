THE DEAN YOU SAVE MAY BE YOUR OWN
Now in the waning days of the school year when the hardest
heart grows mellow and the very air is charged with memories,
let us pause for a moment and pay tribute to that overworked
and underappreciated campus figure, your friend and mine, the
dean of students.
Policeman and confessor, shepherd and seer, warden and
oracle, proconsul and pal, the dean of students is by far the
most enigmatic of all academicians. How can we understand
him? Well sir, perhaps the best way is to take an average day
in the life of an average dean. Here, for example, is what hap
pened last Thursday to Dean Killjoy N. Damper of Duluth
A and M.
At ti a.m. he woke, dressed, lit a Marlboro, and went up on
the roof of his house to remove the statue of the Founder which
had been placed there during the night by high-spirited under
graduates.
At 7 a.in. he lit a Marlboro and walked briskly to the campus,

on th<‘ roof of the girls dormitory by high-spirited under

At 7:45 a.m. he arrived on campus, lit a Marlboro, and
climbed the bell tower to remove his secretary who had been
placed there during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
At 8 a.m. he reached his office, lit a Marlboro, and met with
Dcrther Sigafoos, editor of the student newspaper. Young
Sigafoos had been writing a series of editorials urging the
United States to annex Canada. When his editorials had evoked
no res|H)nse, he had taken matters into his own hands. Accom
panied by his sports editor and two copy readers, he had gone
over the border and conquered Manitoba. With great patience
and several excellent Marlboro Cigarettes, the Dean persuaded
young Sigafoos to give Manitoba back. Young Sigafoos, how
ever, insisted on keeping Winnipeg.
At 9 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with Erwin .1,
Bender, president of the local Sigma Chi chapter, who came to
report that the Deke house had been put on top of the Sigma
Chi house during the night by high-spirited undergraduates.
At 10 a.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and went to umpire an
intramural softball game on the roof of the law school where the
campus baseball diamond had been placed during the night by
high-spirited undergraduates.
At 12 noon the Dean had a luncheon meeting with the presi
dent of the university, the bursar, the registrar, and the chair
man of the English department at the bottom of the campus
swimming pool where the faculty dining room had been placed
during the night by high-spirited undergraduates. Marlboros
were passed after lunch, but not lit owing to the dampness.
At. 2 p.ra., back in his office, the Dean lit a Marlboro and
received the Canadian minister of war who said that unless
young Sigafoos gave back Winnipeg, Canada would march.
Young Sigafoos was summoned and agreed to give back Winni
peg if he could have Saskatoon. The Canadian minister of war
at first refused, but finally agreed after young Sigafoos placed
him on the roof of the mining and metallurgy building.
At 3 p.m. the Dean lit a Marlboro and met with a delegation
from the student council who came to present him with a set
of matched luggage in honor of his fifty years’ service as dean
of students. The Dean promptly packed the luggage with his
clothing and Marlboros and fled to Utica, New York, wdiere he
is now in the aluminum siding game, e, ml M « shuim.n

To the dean of students and all you other hard-working
academic types, here's the new word in smoking pleasure
from the makers of Marlboro — king-size un/iltcrcd Philip
Munis Commander, Welcome aboard!
