# Calls for Applicants For Rhodes Awards
## 
### 
In the last few years Stanford has been poorly represented in
the ranks of Rhodes Scholarship winners. In fact, for two years
prior to this, Stanford went unrepresented, while Harvard accumu
lated a total of 12 winners, Princeton 6, Yale 6, and Dartmouth 7.
The situation began to improve this year when two local students
received the honor, but despite this promising trend, the fact re
mains that Stanford still lags behind the other major universities
of the nation in this field.
There are several apparent reasons behind this lag. One im
portant cause is the lack of close, personable student-faculty rela
tions. When a faculty member is intimately acquainted with the
candidate in question, he can write an effective evaluation and
recommendation. A Harvard professor, for instance, is most likely
to write a full account, including detailed references, critical com
mentary, and incisive evaluation. At most other colleges—perhaps
Stanford included—a student approaches his professor after class
and asks if he may use his name as a reference. The result is a
recommendation based almost entirely upon grades and containing
generalities and cliches that betray a lack of acquaintance with the
student.
Another reason, about which something is presently being done,
is that students lack information concerning post-graduate opportu
nities. Many students who are qualified do not discover that they
are eligible for various graduate honors, such as Rhodes, Woodrow
Wilson, and Fulbright scholarships, until Spring Quarter of their
senior year when it is generally too late. Some people, even though
highly qualified, have feelings of inferiority which keep them from
applying.
Many universities, particularly the eastern schools, conduct in
formational programs, such as the Rhodes seminar at Harvard, to
promote student interest and inform potential candidates of the
possibilities open to them. To supply the needed information to
Stanford students, Dean William Craig, local Rhodes chairman, is
planning to conduct an informational seminar if enough students
express an interest. So far only two such students have been
found. Dean Craig feels that the main problem is to encourage
people to apply. He expressed little doubt that Stanford repre
sentation would increase if more applications would be submitted.
We wish to urge support of his efforts. If Stanford is to rank
itself with the nation's leading universities, it will have to partici
pate to a far greater extent in the prestige scholarship programs.
