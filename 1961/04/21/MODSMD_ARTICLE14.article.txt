All-Time Low
Student interest in the elections
has reached an all-time low this
year. The reason is obvious; stu
dent government is almost use
less. What does student govern
ment do that affects the individ
ual student? Practically nothing;
it organizes a few social affairs.
The rest of the time student gov
ernment might as well not exist.
There are no real issues involved
in the elections; there are few dif
ferences between th candidates;
what does it matter which candi
date is elected? No wonder no
one pays much attention to the
election campaigns, and few
bother to vote.

The solution to the problem of
apathy is simply to make student
government mean something to
the ordinary student. Make the
Legislature, led by the president,
into the elected voice of the cam
pus. Individuals and groups that
are appointed or elected by small
segments of the University popu
lation—i.e., The Daily editor and
the heads of the HR—are often
accepted off-campus as express
ing the opinions of the Stanford
student body, simply because
there no group authorized to ex
press student opinion. The ultra
conservgtive editorials of Mr.
Parker, and formerly the ultra
liberal editorials of Mr. Green
berg, become accepted off-campus
as the opinions of the student
body as a whole. Far better that
an elected body bo entrusted with
expressing the majority opinion
of the campus.

Another Dante?
I am indeed encouraged by Mr.
Grothe’s letter to The Daily claim
ing that “The Daily’s editorials of
the last few months have repe
sented some of the most brilliant
thinking of the thirteenth cen
tury.’’ Any college newspaper
could certainly be proud of having
a Dante, Aquinas, Frederick 11,
or St. Francis write its editorials.

Clouds Campaign
The recent uproar over placing
the ballot boxes in Stern and
Toyon and the resultant secret
executive session of the Legisla
ture has served only to cloud to
a large extent the candidates and
the issues of the campaign. The
attacks, withdrawls and “who,
ME?” letters and the involved at
tacks on The Daily have eclipsed
the real purpose of the campaign
—to present a clear picture of
the candidates and the platforms
on which they stand.
It is a further insult to the Stan
ford students that they should be
accused of being “controlled” by
one candidate. Such control could
only be achieved by superiority of
the candidate involved or the in
ability of other candidates to suf
ficiently present themselves and
their views.
Stanford long ago outgrew
petty "Greek-independent split”
talk. Yet in this year’s campaign
it has been revived by the very
group that is charging others
with reviving it. The campaign
should be directed toward issues
and candidates without being com
plicated by lightfooted political
maneuvers and misleading
charges, aimed at attacking par
ticular candidates with no valid
reason other than unquestioning
partisanship.

Thank You
We wish to thank the Political
Union and the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises for the organization
and presentation of their excel
lent program on the problems of
the nuclear age. This discussion
of the key issue of our day by so
eminent a group as was brought
to the campus this past weekend
is an outstanding example of
Stanford’s acceptance of its re
sponsibility to provide leadership
in community affairs.
