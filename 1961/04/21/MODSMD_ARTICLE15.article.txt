## Exclusive Eight-Hour Interview With Mr. 'K' on Foreign Policy 
### 
(Editor’s Note: This is the first
article in a series of three on an
exclusive interview with Premier
Khrushchev.)
On this, our second visit, my
wife and I were taken on a long
journey by plane and auto to Mr.
Khrushchev’s country place in
Sochi on the Black Sea. Before we
left Moscow, accompanied by two
interpreters and an official of the
press department, there was
much mystery about all the de
tails of the coming visit, such as
when and where we were to see
the Great Man. In fact, as it
turned out, he had no other ap
pointments after half-past eleven
in the morning, when he met us in
the pinewoods near the entrance
of his place. Eight hours later, a
bit worn by much talk and two
large meals, we insisted on leav
ing in order to go to bed,
I would not like to leave the im

ipres-sion that all
eight hours were
devoted to great
affairs of the
world. Perhaps,
all told, three
and-a-half hours
were spent in
serious talk. The
rest of the time
went into the
tw o prolonged
meats at whieh

Mr. Khrushchev, who is on what
appears to be a non-fattening diet,
broke the rules, saying joyously
that the doctor had gone to Mos
cow for a day or two. The talk
was largely banter between Mr.
Khrushchev and Mikoyan, who
joined us for lunch, and the ban
ter turned chiefly on Armenian
food and Armenian wine and Ar
menian customs, which include
the compulsion to drink all
glasses to the end at each toast.
Though we all drank a bit more
than we wanted, Mikoyan chose
to regard us as American ascetics
who only sipped their wine. Fin
ally Mr. Khrushchev took pity on
us by providing a bowl into which
we could pour the wine as fast as
Mikoyan filled our glasses.
For an opening I reminded him
that we had last seen him in Octo
ber 1958, nearly a year before his
visit to the United States. Much
has happened in these two-and
a-half years and would he tell me
what seemed to him the most im
portant events for good or evil?
AFTER A moment or two of
hesitation, he replied that during
this period the two main forces
in the world—the capitalist and
the socialist—have concluded that
it was useless to “test” one an
other by military means. I took
him to mean by “test” the backing
of their political aims by the
threat of w ; ar.
In contrast with 1958, when he
professed to believe that the
United States and Germany might
attack him, he spoke with confi
dence that because of the grow
ing strength of the Communist
orbit, the threat of war from out
side was dying down. As a result,
the United Stales was abandoning
the “Dulles doctrine” that the

neutrality of small stales is ''im
moral.” He himself welcomed
President Kennedy’s proposal for
a neutral Laos.
You think then, I asked him,
that there has been a change in
United States policy? To this he
replied that while there were
some signs of a change, as for ex
ample in Laos, it was not a '‘radi
cal” change, as could be seen in
the United States attitude towards
disarmament. What, I asked him,
is wrong with the United States
attitude? We cannot see, he re
plied, that any change is immi
nent when the subject of disarma
ment is put in the hands of such a
believer in armaments as Mr.
McCloy. We think well of Mr.
McCloy and during his time in
Germany we had good relations
with him. But asking him to deal
with disarmament is a case of
asking the goat to look after the
cabbage patch.
I INTERJECTED the remark
that the final decisions would be
made by the President. But Mr.
Khrushchev insisted that the
forces behind the President would
deter mine his policy. These forces
behind the Kennedy administra
tion he summed up in the one
word “Rockefeller.” The view that
he is running the Kennedy admin
istration will be news to Gov.
Rockefeller. I should add that Mr.
Khrushchev considers me a Re
publican, which will be news to
Mr. Nixon.

Then we got onto the subject
of nuclear testing. He said that
the Western powers were not
ready to conclude an agreement,
and that this was shown, among
other things, by the demand for
21 or perhaps 18 inspections a
year. He had been led personally
to believe that the West would be
satisfied with about three “sym
bolic” inspections. Nineteen in
spections, our present demand,
were nothing but a demand for
the right to conduct complete re
connaissance of the Soviet Union.
I asked him about his attitude
towards underground testing. He
replied that the USSR has never
done any underground testing and
never will. I asked why? Because,
he said, we do not see any value

in small tactical atomic weapons.
It it comes to war, we shall use
only the biggest weapons. The
smaller ones are very expensive
and they can decide nothing. The
fact that they are expensive
doesn’t bother you because you
don’t care what you spend and,
what is more, many of your gen
erals are connected with big busi
ness. But in the USSR we have to
economize, and tactical weapons
are a waste.

Finally, he came to another
reason why an agreement may
not be possible. It turns on the
problem of the administrator of
the agreement. Here, he was vehe
ment and unqualified. He would
never accept a single neutral ad
ministrator. Why? Because, he
said, while there are neutral coun
tries, there are no neutral men.
You would not accept a Commu
nist administrator and I cannot
accept a non-Communist admin
istrator. I will never entrust the
security of the Soviet Union to
any foreigner. We cannot have
another Hammarskjold, no mat
ter where he comes from among
the neutral countries.
Our talk went to Cuba, Iran,
revolutionary movements in gen
eral, and finally to Germany. I
shall report on these topics in sub
sequent articles.

(Editor’s Note: This is the first
article in a series of three on an
exclusive interview with Premier
Khrushchev.)
On this, our second visit, my
wife and I were taken on a long
journey by plane and auto to Mr.
Khrushchev’s country place in
Sochi on the Black Sea. Before we
left Moscow, accompanied by two
interpreters and an official of the
press department, there was
much mystery about all the de
tails of the coming visit, such as
when and where we were to see
the Great Man. In fact, as it
turned out, he had no other ap
pointments after half-past eleven
in the morning, when he met us in
the pinewoods near the entrance
of his place. Eight hours later, a
bit worn by much talk and two
large meals, we insisted on leav
ing in order to go to bed,
I would not like to leave the im

ipres-sion that all
eight hours were
devoted to great
affairs of the
world. Perhaps,
all told, three
and-a-half hours
were spent in
serious talk. The
rest of the time
went into the
tw o prolonged
meats at whieh

Mr. Khrushchev, who is on what
appears to be a non-fattening diet,
broke the rules, saying joyously
that the doctor had gone to Mos
cow for a day or two. The talk
was largely banter between Mr.
Khrushchev and Mikoyan, who
joined us for lunch, and the ban
ter turned chiefly on Armenian
food and Armenian wine and Ar
menian customs, which include
the compulsion to drink all
glasses to the end at each toast.
Though we all drank a bit more
than we wanted, Mikoyan chose
to regard us as American ascetics
who only sipped their wine. Fin
ally Mr. Khrushchev took pity on
us by providing a bowl into which
we could pour the wine as fast as
Mikoyan filled our glasses.
For an opening I reminded him
that we had last seen him in Octo
ber 1958, nearly a year before his
visit to the United States. Much
has happened in these two-and
a-half years and would he tell me
what seemed to him the most im
portant events for good or evil?
AFTER A moment or two of
hesitation, he replied that during
this period the two main forces
in the world—the capitalist and
the socialist—have concluded that
it was useless to “test” one an
other by military means. I took
him to mean by “test” the backing
of their political aims by the
threat of w ; ar.
In contrast with 1958, when he
professed to believe that the
United States and Germany might
attack him, he spoke with confi
dence that because of the grow
ing strength of the Communist
orbit, the threat of war from out
side was dying down. As a result,
the United Stales was abandoning
the “Dulles doctrine” that the

neutrality of small stales is ''im
moral.” He himself welcomed
President Kennedy’s proposal for
a neutral Laos.
You think then, I asked him,
that there has been a change in
United States policy? To this he
replied that while there were
some signs of a change, as for ex
ample in Laos, it was not a '‘radi
cal” change, as could be seen in
the United States attitude towards
disarmament. What, I asked him,
is wrong with the United States
attitude? We cannot see, he re
plied, that any change is immi
nent when the subject of disarma
ment is put in the hands of such a
believer in armaments as Mr.
McCloy. We think well of Mr.
McCloy and during his time in
Germany we had good relations
with him. But asking him to deal
with disarmament is a case of
asking the goat to look after the
cabbage patch.
I INTERJECTED the remark
that the final decisions would be
made by the President. But Mr.
Khrushchev insisted that the
forces behind the President would
deter mine his policy. These forces
behind the Kennedy administra
tion he summed up in the one
word “Rockefeller.” The view that
he is running the Kennedy admin
istration will be news to Gov.
Rockefeller. I should add that Mr.
Khrushchev considers me a Re
publican, which will be news to
Mr. Nixon.

Then we got onto the subject
of nuclear testing. He said that
the Western powers were not
ready to conclude an agreement,
and that this was shown, among
other things, by the demand for
21 or perhaps 18 inspections a
year. He had been led personally
to believe that the West would be
satisfied with about three “sym
bolic” inspections. Nineteen in
spections, our present demand,
were nothing but a demand for
the right to conduct complete re
connaissance of the Soviet Union.
I asked him about his attitude
towards underground testing. He
replied that the USSR has never
done any underground testing and
never will. I asked why? Because,
he said, we do not see any value

in small tactical atomic weapons.
It it comes to war, we shall use
only the biggest weapons. The
smaller ones are very expensive
and they can decide nothing. The
fact that they are expensive
doesn’t bother you because you
don’t care what you spend and,
what is more, many of your gen
erals are connected with big busi
ness. But in the USSR we have to
economize, and tactical weapons
are a waste.

Finally, he came to another
reason why an agreement may
not be possible. It turns on the
problem of the administrator of
the agreement. Here, he was vehe
ment and unqualified. He would
never accept a single neutral ad
ministrator. Why? Because, he
said, while there are neutral coun
tries, there are no neutral men.
You would not accept a Commu
nist administrator and I cannot
accept a non-Communist admin
istrator. I will never entrust the
security of the Soviet Union to
any foreigner. We cannot have
another Hammarskjold, no mat
ter where he comes from among
the neutral countries.
Our talk went to Cuba, Iran,
revolutionary movements in gen
eral, and finally to Germany. I
shall report on these topics in sub
sequent articles.

(Editor’s Note: This is the first
article in a series of three on an
exclusive interview with Premier
Khrushchev.)
On this, our second visit, my
wife and I were taken on a long
journey by plane and auto to Mr.
Khrushchev’s country place in
Sochi on the Black Sea. Before we
left Moscow, accompanied by two
interpreters and an official of the
press department, there was
much mystery about all the de
tails of the coming visit, such as
when and where we were to see
the Great Man. In fact, as it
turned out, he had no other ap
pointments after half-past eleven
in the morning, when he met us in
the pinewoods near the entrance
of his place. Eight hours later, a
bit worn by much talk and two
large meals, we insisted on leav
ing in order to go to bed,
I would not like to leave the im

ipres-sion that all
eight hours were
devoted to great
affairs of the
world. Perhaps,
all told, three
and-a-half hours
were spent in
serious talk. The
rest of the time
went into the
tw o prolonged
meats at whieh

Mr. Khrushchev, who is on what
appears to be a non-fattening diet,
broke the rules, saying joyously
that the doctor had gone to Mos
cow for a day or two. The talk
was largely banter between Mr.
Khrushchev and Mikoyan, who
joined us for lunch, and the ban
ter turned chiefly on Armenian
food and Armenian wine and Ar
menian customs, which include
the compulsion to drink all
glasses to the end at each toast.
Though we all drank a bit more
than we wanted, Mikoyan chose
to regard us as American ascetics
who only sipped their wine. Fin
ally Mr. Khrushchev took pity on
us by providing a bowl into which
we could pour the wine as fast as
Mikoyan filled our glasses.
For an opening I reminded him
that we had last seen him in Octo
ber 1958, nearly a year before his
visit to the United States. Much
has happened in these two-and
a-half years and would he tell me
what seemed to him the most im
portant events for good or evil?
AFTER A moment or two of
hesitation, he replied that during
this period the two main forces
in the world—the capitalist and
the socialist—have concluded that
it was useless to “test” one an
other by military means. I took
him to mean by “test” the backing
of their political aims by the
threat of w ; ar.
In contrast with 1958, when he
professed to believe that the
United States and Germany might
attack him, he spoke with confi
dence that because of the grow
ing strength of the Communist
orbit, the threat of war from out
side was dying down. As a result,
the United Stales was abandoning
the “Dulles doctrine” that the

neutrality of small stales is ''im
moral.” He himself welcomed
President Kennedy’s proposal for
a neutral Laos.
You think then, I asked him,
that there has been a change in
United States policy? To this he
replied that while there were
some signs of a change, as for ex
ample in Laos, it was not a '‘radi
cal” change, as could be seen in
the United States attitude towards
disarmament. What, I asked him,
is wrong with the United States
attitude? We cannot see, he re
plied, that any change is immi
nent when the subject of disarma
ment is put in the hands of such a
believer in armaments as Mr.
McCloy. We think well of Mr.
McCloy and during his time in
Germany we had good relations
with him. But asking him to deal
with disarmament is a case of
asking the goat to look after the
cabbage patch.
I INTERJECTED the remark
that the final decisions would be
made by the President. But Mr.
Khrushchev insisted that the
forces behind the President would
deter mine his policy. These forces
behind the Kennedy administra
tion he summed up in the one
word “Rockefeller.” The view that
he is running the Kennedy admin
istration will be news to Gov.
Rockefeller. I should add that Mr.
Khrushchev considers me a Re
publican, which will be news to
Mr. Nixon.

Then we got onto the subject
of nuclear testing. He said that
the Western powers were not
ready to conclude an agreement,
and that this was shown, among
other things, by the demand for
21 or perhaps 18 inspections a
year. He had been led personally
to believe that the West would be
satisfied with about three “sym
bolic” inspections. Nineteen in
spections, our present demand,
were nothing but a demand for
the right to conduct complete re
connaissance of the Soviet Union.
I asked him about his attitude
towards underground testing. He
replied that the USSR has never
done any underground testing and
never will. I asked why? Because,
he said, we do not see any value

in small tactical atomic weapons.
It it comes to war, we shall use
only the biggest weapons. The
smaller ones are very expensive
and they can decide nothing. The
fact that they are expensive
doesn’t bother you because you
don’t care what you spend and,
what is more, many of your gen
erals are connected with big busi
ness. But in the USSR we have to
economize, and tactical weapons
are a waste.

Finally, he came to another
reason why an agreement may
not be possible. It turns on the
problem of the administrator of
the agreement. Here, he was vehe
ment and unqualified. He would
never accept a single neutral ad
ministrator. Why? Because, he
said, while there are neutral coun
tries, there are no neutral men.
You would not accept a Commu
nist administrator and I cannot
accept a non-Communist admin
istrator. I will never entrust the
security of the Soviet Union to
any foreigner. We cannot have
another Hammarskjold, no mat
ter where he comes from among
the neutral countries.
Our talk went to Cuba, Iran,
revolutionary movements in gen
eral, and finally to Germany. I
shall report on these topics in sub
sequent articles.

(Editor’s Note: This is the first
article in a series of three on an
exclusive interview with Premier
Khrushchev.)
On this, our second visit, my
wife and I were taken on a long
journey by plane and auto to Mr.
Khrushchev’s country place in
Sochi on the Black Sea. Before we
left Moscow, accompanied by two
interpreters and an official of the
press department, there was
much mystery about all the de
tails of the coming visit, such as
when and where we were to see
the Great Man. In fact, as it
turned out, he had no other ap
pointments after half-past eleven
in the morning, when he met us in
the pinewoods near the entrance
of his place. Eight hours later, a
bit worn by much talk and two
large meals, we insisted on leav
ing in order to go to bed,
I would not like to leave the im

ipres-sion that all
eight hours were
devoted to great
affairs of the
world. Perhaps,
all told, three
and-a-half hours
were spent in
serious talk. The
rest of the time
went into the
tw o prolonged
meats at whieh

Mr. Khrushchev, who is on what
appears to be a non-fattening diet,
broke the rules, saying joyously
that the doctor had gone to Mos
cow for a day or two. The talk
was largely banter between Mr.
Khrushchev and Mikoyan, who
joined us for lunch, and the ban
ter turned chiefly on Armenian
food and Armenian wine and Ar
menian customs, which include
the compulsion to drink all
glasses to the end at each toast.
Though we all drank a bit more
than we wanted, Mikoyan chose
to regard us as American ascetics
who only sipped their wine. Fin
ally Mr. Khrushchev took pity on
us by providing a bowl into which
we could pour the wine as fast as
Mikoyan filled our glasses.
For an opening I reminded him
that we had last seen him in Octo
ber 1958, nearly a year before his
visit to the United States. Much
has happened in these two-and
a-half years and would he tell me
what seemed to him the most im
portant events for good or evil?
AFTER A moment or two of
hesitation, he replied that during
this period the two main forces
in the world—the capitalist and
the socialist—have concluded that
it was useless to “test” one an
other by military means. I took
him to mean by “test” the backing
of their political aims by the
threat of w ; ar.
In contrast with 1958, when he
professed to believe that the
United States and Germany might
attack him, he spoke with confi
dence that because of the grow
ing strength of the Communist
orbit, the threat of war from out
side was dying down. As a result,
the United Stales was abandoning
the “Dulles doctrine” that the

neutrality of small stales is ''im
moral.” He himself welcomed
President Kennedy’s proposal for
a neutral Laos.
You think then, I asked him,
that there has been a change in
United States policy? To this he
replied that while there were
some signs of a change, as for ex
ample in Laos, it was not a '‘radi
cal” change, as could be seen in
the United States attitude towards
disarmament. What, I asked him,
is wrong with the United States
attitude? We cannot see, he re
plied, that any change is immi
nent when the subject of disarma
ment is put in the hands of such a
believer in armaments as Mr.
McCloy. We think well of Mr.
McCloy and during his time in
Germany we had good relations
with him. But asking him to deal
with disarmament is a case of
asking the goat to look after the
cabbage patch.
I INTERJECTED the remark
that the final decisions would be
made by the President. But Mr.
Khrushchev insisted that the
forces behind the President would
deter mine his policy. These forces
behind the Kennedy administra
tion he summed up in the one
word “Rockefeller.” The view that
he is running the Kennedy admin
istration will be news to Gov.
Rockefeller. I should add that Mr.
Khrushchev considers me a Re
publican, which will be news to
Mr. Nixon.

Then we got onto the subject
of nuclear testing. He said that
the Western powers were not
ready to conclude an agreement,
and that this was shown, among
other things, by the demand for
21 or perhaps 18 inspections a
year. He had been led personally
to believe that the West would be
satisfied with about three “sym
bolic” inspections. Nineteen in
spections, our present demand,
were nothing but a demand for
the right to conduct complete re
connaissance of the Soviet Union.
I asked him about his attitude
towards underground testing. He
replied that the USSR has never
done any underground testing and
never will. I asked why? Because,
he said, we do not see any value

in small tactical atomic weapons.
It it comes to war, we shall use
only the biggest weapons. The
smaller ones are very expensive
and they can decide nothing. The
fact that they are expensive
doesn’t bother you because you
don’t care what you spend and,
what is more, many of your gen
erals are connected with big busi
ness. But in the USSR we have to
economize, and tactical weapons
are a waste.

Finally, he came to another
reason why an agreement may
not be possible. It turns on the
problem of the administrator of
the agreement. Here, he was vehe
ment and unqualified. He would
never accept a single neutral ad
ministrator. Why? Because, he
said, while there are neutral coun
tries, there are no neutral men.
You would not accept a Commu
nist administrator and I cannot
accept a non-Communist admin
istrator. I will never entrust the
security of the Soviet Union to
any foreigner. We cannot have
another Hammarskjold, no mat
ter where he comes from among
the neutral countries.
Our talk went to Cuba, Iran,
revolutionary movements in gen
eral, and finally to Germany. I
shall report on these topics in sub
sequent articles.
