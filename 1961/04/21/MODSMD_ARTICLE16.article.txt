Possibilities of (take a deep
breath) a four-minute mile, a 9.3 1
100-yard dash, a 65-foot, shot-put, I
a seven-foot high jump, a 15-foot;
pole vault, a world’s record in the i
quarter-mile and a 25-foot broad 1
jump, plus a hot-tempered rivalry]
between the best two track teams
in the country will make tomor-1
row’s triangular meet in Stan-1
ford Stadium a collector’s item in I
the memories of the 20-23,000 ex-;
pected to be in attendance.
Starting time for the field:
events in the Oregon-Southern
Cal-Stanford contest is 1:30, The
mile will start at 2 p.m.
•STANFORD’S chances of win
ning the meet are (to paraphrase
James Heston's analysis of what I
Lyndon Johnston chances were of |

winning the Demorcatic Presiden
tial nomination) approximately
zere but Tribe Coach Payton
Jordan sees bis charges in the
role of spoilers with a chance to
affect the outcome.

Major concern in the meet will
center around the scoring of the
SC-Oregon dual meet. The Tro
jans have not lost a dual meet
since 1945 and the closest any
team has come to beating them
is Oregon who almost pulled it

off (wo .seasons ago at Stanford.
That time the Southerners had to
go all the way to the relay, the
last event, to win.
MOST DOPE sheets add up to
SC winning by about 20 points
but a few Trojans cracking up
under the pressure of the mbment
will be all the Ducks need to win.
Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s junior
miler, could give the Stanford
track its first taste of a four
minute mile. Burlie is quickly
rounding into his outdoor form
this year with a best time of
4:04.2. Last year, Burleson picked
on a meet with Stanford at Eu
gene to set an American citizen’s
mile record with a 3:58.6.
In that race Dyrol let Stanford’s
Ernie Cunliffe who was by then
making an all-out assault on the
four-minute mile himself lead
for three and three-quarters lap
and then turned on his famous
final burst of speed to leave the
faltering Cunliffe 15 yards behind
at the tape. Ernie’s time that day
was 4:00.4, the best he has ever
done, but Burleson, of course, was
the hero of the moment.
THE Pit I.ME competition Burle
[son will get will be from team
mates George Larson anti Keith
Forman. Larson has done the four
laps in 4:07.6 already this year
and Forman turned in a 4:08.6
last year.
Burleson is expected also to
start in the 880 and conceivably
i could he at the starting line for
the two-mile.
| Odds on favorite in the 100 will
|be Oregon’s Harry Jerome. The
[ Canadian sprinter has gone the
distance in 9.4 this year. Again
the major source of prodding will
! come from his own team as Ros
j coe Cook, with a 9.6 this year,
should be right up in there.
TAKING A psychological ap
proach to the 100, the following
might be considered intriguing.
Through the years most of the
best 100-yard-dash men have, at
one time or another, competed in
the Stadium. Mel Patton, Leamon
King and Ray Norton are three
of the 9.3 boys who have compe
ted locally for instance. Yet until
this year the Stadium reeord for
the century was 9.5. None of the
■sprint giants could do any better.
But this year San Jose sprinter
Dennis Johnson has run it in 9.3
twice. Maybe Jerome can take his
cue from that.
DALLAS LONG, the crown
prince of the shot-put, will give
SC first place points in his event.
Long’s best mark for the year is
64-3' i.

John Thomas’s Stadium (and
world) record of 7-3% in the high

jump is probably safe enough but
SC's Bob Avant lias been up to
6-10V4 and will be making an as
suit on seven feet.
The best field event competition
from all three teams will probably
be in the pole vault where Trojan
Jim Brewer will be the favorite.
Brewer, a sensation in high school
several years ago, is just now be
ginning to live up to his tremen

dous potential after many observ
ers had written him off as a flash
in the pan.
BREWER HAW vaulted 15-2’i
this year. Teamate Mel Hein could
give Brewer a run for it as Hein
has a season’s best of 14-7. Ore
gon’s major entry in the polo
vault, Phil Paquin, is out with an
injury but the Ducks will still be
in the running with Dari McAl
lister who has gone 14-4 this year.
Stanford’s fine sophomore, Phil
White, will be trying for some
Indian points. White also has a
best of 14-4 this year.

The oldest Stadium record of
46.6 for the quarter-mile could
be broken as Rex Cawley, who
has already done 46.2 this year,
will run the one-lapper for SC.
HI'BIE KEARNS set the pres
ent record in 1941. The world rec
ord is 45.7 which is not out of
Cawley’s reach.

One of the few Stanford
chances to pick up a first place
will he riding on Dan Moore in the
broad jump.
Last week in a meet with UCLA
Moore became the third best
broad jumper in University his
tory and the third Stanford man
to go over 25 feet. He turned in a
251 against the Bruins.

Students planning to see the
meet have been urged by the Ath
letic Department to buy tickets
early since the anticipated line of
fans just before the meet will
probably be such that the unlucky
ones could conceivably miss the
mile and the shot-put, two of the
outstanding events of the day.
Possibilities of (take a deep

100-yard dash, a 65-foot, shot-put, I

Major concern in the meet will
center around the scoring of the
SC-Oregon dual meet. The Tro
jans have not lost a dual meet
since 1945 and the closest any
team has come to beating them
is Oregon who almost pulled it

off (wo .seasons ago at Stanford.
That time the Southerners had to
go all the way to the relay, the
last event, to win.

but a few Trojans cracking up

will be all the Ducks need to win.
Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s junior
miler, could give the Stanford
track its first taste of a four
minute mile. Burlie is quickly
rounding into his outdoor form
this year with a best time of
4:04.2. Last year, Burleson picked
on a meet with Stanford at Eu
gene to set an American citizen’s
mile record with a 3:58.6.
In that race Dyrol let Stanford’s
Ernie Cunliffe who was by then
making an all-out assault on the
four-minute mile himself lead
for three and three-quarters lap
and then turned on his famous
final burst of speed to leave the
faltering Cunliffe 15 yards behind
at the tape. Ernie’s time that day
was 4:00.4, the best he has ever
done, but Burleson, of course, was
the hero of the moment.
THE Pit I.ME competition Burle
[son will get will be from team
mates George Larson anti Keith
Forman. Larson has done the four
laps in 4:07.6 already this year
and Forman turned in a 4:08.6
last year.
Burleson is expected also to
start in the 880 and conceivably
i could he at the starting line for
the two-mile.
| Odds on favorite in the 100 will
|be Oregon’s Harry Jerome. The
[ Canadian sprinter has gone the
distance in 9.4 this year. Again
the major source of prodding will
! come from his own team as Ros
j coe Cook, with a 9.6 this year,
should be right up in there.
TAKING A psychological ap
proach to the 100, the following
might be considered intriguing.
Through the years most of the
best 100-yard-dash men have, at
one time or another, competed in
the Stadium. Mel Patton, Leamon
King and Ray Norton are three
of the 9.3 boys who have compe
ted locally for instance. Yet until
this year the Stadium reeord for
the century was 9.5. None of the
■sprint giants could do any better.
But this year San Jose sprinter
Dennis Johnson has run it in 9.3
twice. Maybe Jerome can take his
cue from that.
DALLAS LONG, the crown
prince of the shot-put, will give
SC first place points in his event.
Long’s best mark for the year is
64-3' i.

John Thomas’s Stadium (and
world) record of 7-3% in the high

jump is probably safe enough but
SC's Bob Avant lias been up to
6-10V4 and will be making an as
suit on seven feet.
The best field event competition
from all three teams will probably
be in the pole vault where Trojan
Jim Brewer will be the favorite.
Brewer, a sensation in high school
several years ago, is just now be
ginning to live up to his tremen

dous potential after many observ
ers had written him off as a flash
in the pan.
BREWER HAW vaulted 15-2’i
this year. Teamate Mel Hein could
give Brewer a run for it as Hein
has a season’s best of 14-7. Ore
gon’s major entry in the polo
vault, Phil Paquin, is out with an
injury but the Ducks will still be
in the running with Dari McAl
lister who has gone 14-4 this year.
Stanford’s fine sophomore, Phil
White, will be trying for some
Indian points. White also has a
best of 14-4 this year.

The oldest Stadium record of
46.6 for the quarter-mile could
be broken as Rex Cawley, who
has already done 46.2 this year,
will run the one-lapper for SC.

•STANFORD’S chances of win

Lyndon Johnston chances were of |

winning the Demorcatic Presiden
tial nomination) approximately
zere but Tribe Coach Payton
Jordan sees bis charges in the
role of spoilers with a chance to
affect the outcome.

Major concern in the meet will
center around the scoring of the
SC-Oregon dual meet. The Tro
jans have not lost a dual meet
since 1945 and the closest any
team has come to beating them
is Oregon who almost pulled it

off (wo .seasons ago at Stanford.
That time the Southerners had to
go all the way to the relay, the
last event, to win.
MOST DOPE sheets add up to
SC winning by about 20 points
but a few Trojans cracking up
under the pressure of the mbment
will be all the Ducks need to win.
Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s junior
miler, could give the Stanford
track its first taste of a four
minute mile. Burlie is quickly
rounding into his outdoor form
this year with a best time of
4:04.2. Last year, Burleson picked
on a meet with Stanford at Eu
gene to set an American citizen’s
mile record with a 3:58.6.
In that race Dyrol let Stanford’s
Ernie Cunliffe who was by then
making an all-out assault on the
four-minute mile himself lead
for three and three-quarters lap
and then turned on his famous
final burst of speed to leave the
faltering Cunliffe 15 yards behind
at the tape. Ernie’s time that day
was 4:00.4, the best he has ever
done, but Burleson, of course, was
the hero of the moment.
THE Pit I.ME competition Burle
[son will get will be from team
mates George Larson anti Keith
Forman. Larson has done the four
laps in 4:07.6 already this year
and Forman turned in a 4:08.6
last year.
Burleson is expected also to
start in the 880 and conceivably
i could he at the starting line for
the two-mile.
| Odds on favorite in the 100 will
|be Oregon’s Harry Jerome. The
[ Canadian sprinter has gone the
distance in 9.4 this year. Again
the major source of prodding will
! come from his own team as Ros
j coe Cook, with a 9.6 this year,
should be right up in there.
TAKING A psychological ap
proach to the 100, the following
might be considered intriguing.
Through the years most of the
best 100-yard-dash men have, at
one time or another, competed in
the Stadium. Mel Patton, Leamon
King and Ray Norton are three
of the 9.3 boys who have compe
ted locally for instance. Yet until
this year the Stadium reeord for
the century was 9.5. None of the
■sprint giants could do any better.
But this year San Jose sprinter
Dennis Johnson has run it in 9.3
twice. Maybe Jerome can take his
cue from that.
DALLAS LONG, the crown
prince of the shot-put, will give
SC first place points in his event.
Long’s best mark for the year is
64-3' i.

John Thomas’s Stadium (and
world) record of 7-3% in the high

jump is probably safe enough but
SC's Bob Avant lias been up to
6-10V4 and will be making an as
suit on seven feet.
The best field event competition
from all three teams will probably
be in the pole vault where Trojan
Jim Brewer will be the favorite.
Brewer, a sensation in high school
several years ago, is just now be
ginning to live up to his tremen

dous potential after many observ
ers had written him off as a flash
in the pan.
BREWER HAW vaulted 15-2’i
this year. Teamate Mel Hein could
give Brewer a run for it as Hein
has a season’s best of 14-7. Ore
gon’s major entry in the polo
vault, Phil Paquin, is out with an
injury but the Ducks will still be
in the running with Dari McAl
lister who has gone 14-4 this year.
Stanford’s fine sophomore, Phil
White, will be trying for some
Indian points. White also has a
best of 14-4 this year.

The oldest Stadium record of
46.6 for the quarter-mile could
be broken as Rex Cawley, who
has already done 46.2 this year,
will run the one-lapper for SC.
HI'BIE KEARNS set the pres

Students planning to see the
meet have been urged by the Ath
letic Department to buy tickets
early since the anticipated line of
fans just before the meet will
probably be such that the unlucky
ones could conceivably miss the
mile and the shot-put, two of the
outstanding events of the day.
Possibilities of (take a deep
breath) a four-minute mile, a 9.3 1
100-yard dash, a 65-foot, shot-put, I
a seven-foot high jump, a 15-foot;
pole vault, a world’s record in the i
quarter-mile and a 25-foot broad 1
jump, plus a hot-tempered rivalry]
between the best two track teams
in the country will make tomor-1
row’s triangular meet in Stan-1
ford Stadium a collector’s item in I
the memories of the 20-23,000 ex-;
pected to be in attendance.
Starting time for the field:
events in the Oregon-Southern
Cal-Stanford contest is 1:30, The
mile will start at 2 p.m.
•STANFORD’S chances of win
ning the meet are (to paraphrase
James Heston's analysis of what I
Lyndon Johnston chances were of |

winning the Demorcatic Presiden
tial nomination) approximately
zere but Tribe Coach Payton
Jordan sees bis charges in the
role of spoilers with a chance to
affect the outcome.

Major concern in the meet will
center around the scoring of the
SC-Oregon dual meet. The Tro
jans have not lost a dual meet
since 1945 and the closest any
team has come to beating them
is Oregon who almost pulled it

off (wo .seasons ago at Stanford.
That time the Southerners had to
go all the way to the relay, the
last event, to win.
MOST DOPE sheets add up to
SC winning by about 20 points
but a few Trojans cracking up
under the pressure of the mbment
will be all the Ducks need to win.
Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s junior
miler, could give the Stanford
track its first taste of a four
minute mile. Burlie is quickly
rounding into his outdoor form
this year with a best time of
4:04.2. Last year, Burleson picked
on a meet with Stanford at Eu
gene to set an American citizen’s
mile record with a 3:58.6.
In that race Dyrol let Stanford’s
Ernie Cunliffe who was by then
making an all-out assault on the
four-minute mile himself lead
for three and three-quarters lap
and then turned on his famous
final burst of speed to leave the
faltering Cunliffe 15 yards behind
at the tape. Ernie’s time that day
was 4:00.4, the best he has ever
done, but Burleson, of course, was
the hero of the moment.
THE Pit I.ME competition Burle
[son will get will be from team
mates George Larson anti Keith
Forman. Larson has done the four
laps in 4:07.6 already this year
and Forman turned in a 4:08.6
last year.
Burleson is expected also to
start in the 880 and conceivably
i could he at the starting line for
the two-mile.
| Odds on favorite in the 100 will
|be Oregon’s Harry Jerome. The
[ Canadian sprinter has gone the
distance in 9.4 this year. Again
the major source of prodding will
! come from his own team as Ros
j coe Cook, with a 9.6 this year,
should be right up in there.
TAKING A psychological ap
proach to the 100, the following
might be considered intriguing.
Through the years most of the
best 100-yard-dash men have, at
one time or another, competed in
the Stadium. Mel Patton, Leamon
King and Ray Norton are three
of the 9.3 boys who have compe
ted locally for instance. Yet until
this year the Stadium reeord for
the century was 9.5. None of the
■sprint giants could do any better.
But this year San Jose sprinter
Dennis Johnson has run it in 9.3
twice. Maybe Jerome can take his
cue from that.
DALLAS LONG, the crown
prince of the shot-put, will give
SC first place points in his event.
Long’s best mark for the year is
64-3' i.

John Thomas’s Stadium (and
world) record of 7-3% in the high

jump is probably safe enough but
SC's Bob Avant lias been up to
6-10V4 and will be making an as
suit on seven feet.
The best field event competition
from all three teams will probably
be in the pole vault where Trojan
Jim Brewer will be the favorite.
Brewer, a sensation in high school
several years ago, is just now be
ginning to live up to his tremen

dous potential after many observ
ers had written him off as a flash
in the pan.
BREWER HAW vaulted 15-2’i
this year. Teamate Mel Hein could
give Brewer a run for it as Hein
has a season’s best of 14-7. Ore
gon’s major entry in the polo
vault, Phil Paquin, is out with an
injury but the Ducks will still be
in the running with Dari McAl
lister who has gone 14-4 this year.
Stanford’s fine sophomore, Phil
White, will be trying for some
Indian points. White also has a
best of 14-4 this year.

The oldest Stadium record of
46.6 for the quarter-mile could
be broken as Rex Cawley, who
has already done 46.2 this year,
will run the one-lapper for SC.
HI'BIE KEARNS set the pres
ent record in 1941. The world rec
ord is 45.7 which is not out of
Cawley’s reach.

One of the few Stanford
chances to pick up a first place
will he riding on Dan Moore in the
broad jump.
Last week in a meet with UCLA
Moore became the third best
broad jumper in University his
tory and the third Stanford man
to go over 25 feet. He turned in a
251 against the Bruins.

Students planning to see the
meet have been urged by the Ath
letic Department to buy tickets
early since the anticipated line of
fans just before the meet will
probably be such that the unlucky
ones could conceivably miss the
mile and the shot-put, two of the
outstanding events of the day.
