Young Mike McCormick, pitch
ing nearly flawless ball, set the
Cincinnati Reds down on four hits
yesterday while hurling the San
Francisco Giants to a 2-1 victory.
His fast ball humming and his
curves breaking sharply, McCor
mick struck out five and walked
only one as he chalked up his
second win against one defeat.
McCormick hooked up in a bril
liant mound duel with young Jim
O’Toole of the Reds and the vic
tory was fashioned on a pair of
runs scored in the second and
third innings on fielder’s choices.
The Giants got a run in the sec
ond when Felipe Alou walked,
went to third on catcher Bob
Schmidt’s single and scored- on
third baseman Jimmy Daven
port’s infield out. The other run
came when McCormick led off
with a single and was erased on
second baseman Joe Amalfitano’s
fielder’s choice. Harvey Kuenn
singled Amalfitano to third, from
where he scored on Willie Mays’
infield out.
