# Stanford Nine to Host Potent California Bears
## 
### 
Deep in the depths of the CIBA
cellar, Stanford’s varsity baseball
team will take on second-place
California on the Sunken Dia
mond tomorrow in quest of their
first league win. 'Game time is

3:13 p.m.
The Bears, having gotten a late
start against CIBA opponents,
are 3-1 and trail the league lead
ing UCLA Bruins by just one
game. Cal boasts two of the
league’s top five hitters in Kevin
Scarpelli .421 and Bob Millinich
.400.

For the Indians, it’s been a hard
luck story so far. Their five losses
have all been close ones except
for a one-hit, 4-0 shutout, thrown
at them by Ken Bondee of the
Bruins alst weekend. The Cards
can stay with anyone in the
league but just haven’t gotten or
made the breaks.

With all starting pitchers well
rested for this one. Stanford can
call on any one of its successful
trio Marv Mecklenberg, Jim
Smith and Mark Miller. All three
pitched well last weekend in los
ing efforts to UCLA and USC.
An outside chance could be Earl
Russell, who relieved effectively
in both games of the Bruin double
header.
A change is expected in the

usual Stanford lineup with Bob
Overmann taking over behind the
plate and Mike Magee moving to
second base. This would send
heavy-hitting Skip Lawrence to
right.
Overmann and Magee both
turned in sterling performances
afield against UCLA.

The remainder of the lineup
should include Lee Moench, first
base; Joel Shulman, shortstop;
Rich Ferrazzano, third; John
Hurl but left field; and Hal Schulz
mann. center field.


SKIP LAWRENCE
Could be moved to right tomorrow
