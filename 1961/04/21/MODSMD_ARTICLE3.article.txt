## 'U.S. Will Act To Help Cuba If Necessary' 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Presi
dent Kennedy, declaring that the
United States will not abandon
Cuba, warned the Communists
yesterday that this country will
act on its own if necessary to
block Red aggression in the west
ern hemisphere.
“Let the record show that our
restraint is not inexhaustible,” he
said in proclaiming a new version
of the Monroe Doctrine.
IN HIS hardest hitting foreign
policy speech since taking office
three months ago, the president
also served notice on Russia that
this country will tolerate no
charge of “intervention” from the
bloody suppressors of the Hunga
rian revolution.
With fighting words, Kennedy
declared that the United States
will act quickly and alone to coun
ter Communist penetration of the
hemisphere if other American na
tions use the doctrine of non-in
tervention to evade such a tough
course.
“Should it ever appear that the
inter-American doctrine of non
interference merely conceals or
excuses a policy of non-action—if
the nations of this hemisphere
should fail to meet their commit
ments against outside Communist
penetration—then I want it clear
ly understood that this govern
ment will not hesitate in meeting
its primary obligations which are
to the security of our nation.”
HIS WORDS' were a direct
warning to Russia. But the presi
dent also cautioned other Ameri
can nations that the United States
expected them to live up to their
hemispheric defense pledges. If
they don’t, the United States will
act without them.
“Should that time ever come,”
he told Russia, “we do not intend
to be lectured on ‘intervention’ by
t hose whose character was
stamped for all time on the bloody
streets of Budapest.”
In pledging that Cuba would
not bo abandoned, Kennedy dis
closed he had been in contact with
Dr. Jose Miro Cardona, head of
the Cuban revolutionary council
which is directing efforts to over
throw Castro. The Cuban sought
the meeting and Kennedy ar
ranged for them to come to the
capital from Miami, Fla.
