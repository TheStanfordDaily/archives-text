# Daily Editor Hit By Legislature
## 
### JERRY RANKIN 
Legislature last night "strong
ly” censured Daily Editor May
nard Parker for leaking news of
what went on in LASSU’s execu
tive session last week.
After a tense, sometimes bitter
two and one-half hour discussion
of Parker’s editorial policies—and
the leaking of news of the execu
tivescssion which was printed in
last Friday’s Daily in particular—
LASSU voted 18-4 to censure him.
IT THEN approved by an iden
tical vote placing on next week’s
final election ballot the proposal
that "the editor of the . . . Daily
may be removed for stated cause
at a special election which may
be called by either two-thirds vote
of the Legislature or by petition
of 5 per cent of the” students.
This would enable the students,
by their own initiative or by a
two-thirds LASSU vote, to call a
special election to remove The
Daily editor. Two-thirds of the
votes cast would bo necessary for
recall.
The 18-4 vote to censure Parker
was taken while LASSU was
in “committee of the whole" to
permit freer discussion than
would be possible under regular
session.
WHEN IT returned to regular
session, the vote for censure was
16-6. While the policies and al
leged “irresponsibility” of the ed
itor were attacked during the long
discussion, the censure motion
passed referred only to his “al
lowing to be printed” the story
of what was discussed in the
closed-door session last week.
Another motion demanding cen
sure for what Moore Representa
tive Nancy Newman called Par
ker’s “many instances of irrespon
sibility” was beaten 16-3, with
3 abstentions.
One other move to take election
of the editor out of The Daily
staff’s hands and have the stu
dent body elect him w'as defeated
with only one yes vote.
DURING THE marathon meet
ing—held before about aO spec
tators who crowded the Bowman
Alumni House room—Parker
came under fire for what some
LASSU members called his “bla
tant irresponsibility” and “gen
eral incompetence.”
His leak last week concerning
the executive session drew the
most criticism.
Parker countered that he was
within his rights in leaking the
news to The Daily reporter who
was barred from the executive
session. He said this is done often
in relations between the press
and governmental bodies which
hold secret meetings.
HE DECLARED, however, that
he would walk out of any future
LASSU executive sessions and
would attempt to obtain news of
what happened in them after they
were over.
Law Sch o ol Rep Lincoln
Mitchell charged there has been a
“clear pattern of irresponsibility
or incompetence” on the part of
The Daily since Parker became
editor in early February.
He and other LASSU members
presented examples of what they
felt have been “irresponsible er
rors and distortions” in the edi
tor’s editorials and some news
stories in the paper since Parker
was elected.
PARKER SAID in reply that
provisions of the ASSU consti
tution regarding complaints to
The Daily editor had not been car
ried out.
Article 3, section 9 of (he con
stitution’s by-laws concerning the
paper says “All complaints con
cerning the editorial policies . . .
shall be referred to Publications
Board for discussion and recom
mendations . . . All decisions
reached by (the board) shall have
the effect of official recommenda
tions from the board to The
Daily.”
Parker said this procedure had
not been followed and should be
before Legislature took any
action.
