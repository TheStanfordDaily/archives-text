# $346 Million Needed By Stanford in '6O's

(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
(third of four articles dealing with
the University’s detailed plans for
expenditure of the funds to be
raised in the PACE drive.)
Big as it is, Stanford's three
year $l00 million drive to match
the Ford grant actually will pro
vide less than a third of the cost
of keeping the University running
in the Sixties.
For University officials pre
dict $346 million will be necessary
to operate Stanford at its current
high level of excellence during the
decade.
Thus, while they obviously ex
pect to come up with the huge
sum, officials point out that suc
cess of the PACE effort is vital
if the University is to obtain the
$346 million.
THE PACE money will be used
primarily to provide faculty mem
bers to teach and buildings to hold
6,000 undergraduate and 5,300
graduate students expected to
roam the Farm by 1970.
Of the estimated 5,300 gradu
ates, some 750 will eventually be
enrolled in the Graduate School
of Business, as compared with the
present 440.
“To accommodate this growth,
and to provide more suitable li
brary and classroom facilities, a
new building will be constructed
just west of Memorial Audito
rium, across Serra Street from
the . . . Stanford Art Gallery,”
the University says.

“THE NEW building will fea
ture classrooms especially adapt
ed to new business teaching meth
ods. ... It will also house the
newly founded International Cen
ter for Advanced Management Ed
ucation . . . which provides train
ing for teachers of business ad
ministration abroad, and the Stan
ford-Sloan Program which pro
vides the opportunity for promis
ing young executives from indus
try and Stanford Ph.D. candidates
to study together in a nine-month
seminar under the guidance of
outstanding professors.”
Total amount to be spent on the
professional and graduate schools
is $10,285,000, of which $5,025,000
will go for the new Business
School structure.
REHABILITATION of the
School of Education will get $260,-
000 for additional office, teaching
and research facilities in the base
ment of the building.
And the University expects fur
ther relief to come when the Psy
chology Department, now sharing
space in the Education Building,
moves to the behavioral sciences
building on Outer Quad.
Construction of a new clinical
research building at the Medical
Center will cost $2.5 million and
will complete the first stage of
the center.
THE BUILDING ‘‘will house all
or part of research programs in
medicine, surgery, obstetrics and
radiology, which are now seri
ously overcrowded,” Stanford of
ficials report.
It also will permit expansion
and integration of current work
in pediatrics and genetics, with
new emphasis on hereditary dis
eases.
The new building will lie be
tween the Stanford Hospital pavi
lion and the Medical School, on
the east side of the complex.
The building will run $5 million,
of which one-half will be sought
from federal grants for construc
tion of medical research facilities.
EXPANSION and rehabilitation
of the School of Law will cost $2.5
million. Additional class and sem
inar rooms (the school now oper
ates with only three classrooms
and one seminar room), a sub
stantially larger library collection
and differently designed library
facilities for student and faculty
use are planned.
When the Business School moves
from its home next door, the Law
School will take over (hat space
and reconstruct it to house an
entirely new law library.
The space thus freed, and the
law annex just south of the Law
Building, will be converted to
classroom and faculty use.
