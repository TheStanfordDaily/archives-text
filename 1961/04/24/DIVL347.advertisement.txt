PHELPS-TERKEL TELLS
THE GANT STORY!
W e think It Is very fitting that the name of Gant, first-family of New
England traditional shirtmakers be now wedded (commercially speaking)
to Phelps-Terkel, California’s first traditional men’s shop since 1923, and
the marriage commemorated on a label.
We invite you to celebrate this occasion with us by owning some of these
labels yourself, firmly sewed to shirts with the softly-flared button-down
collar that only Gant can make so gently right.
That certain well-bred look of a Gant shirt is a New England heritage
but you need no longer make the journey east. All Phelps-Terkel stores are
now showing Gant’s fine oxfords in long or short sleeves, and the price is the
same as in New England, $5.95,
