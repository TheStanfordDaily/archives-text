# Enthusiasm Marked Dr. Keesing's Life
## 
### 
Within a week after the tragic electrocution of Dr. Philip B. Gal
lagher, death claimed another of Stanford's noted faculty members.
Dr. Felix M. Keesing, Executive Head of the Department of Anthro
pology, who was recognized as the world's leading expert on an
thropology of the South Pacific islands, died of a heart attack Saturday
after collapsing while playing tennis. Dr. Keesing was 59.
Dr. Keesing conducted extensive field work among the peoples
of the Pacific and Philippine islands and also among the Menomini
Indians of Wisconsin, with particular emphasis upon the study of
culture change. This work served as the basis for several books,
including Culture Change and Cultural Anthropology; The Science
oi Custom, and also several monographs on the peoples he studied.
At the time of his death, Dr. Keesing was in the midst of preparing
a work on Philippine culture groups.
In the academic area, Dr. Keesing was described by his colleagues
as a conscientious scholar and able administrator. As a person, he
was termed a lively man whose great enthusiasm and energy af
fected everything he undertook. This enthusiasm found vent in his
academic work, in successful efforts to improve the curriculum, and
in rooting at football games and other sports events of which he was
an avid follower.
Dean Philip H. Rhinelander expressed the sentiments of all who
knew Dr. Keesing when he said, "His death is a very great loss to
all of us. His place will be almost impossible to fill."
Energetic to the end, Dr. Keesing will be remembered not only
for the excellence of his scientific work but also for that energy
which not only made his own life satisfying but also gave exuber
ance to everyone with whom he came into contact.
