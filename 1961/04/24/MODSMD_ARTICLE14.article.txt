Try Oaths

My colleague Wilfred Stone cer
tainly showed poor sportsman
ship in response to your demon
stration that his words could be
used to mean the reverse of what
he meant when he wrote them. I
am glad that you refused to let
his protest distract any of your
moral attention from the far more
serious issue of preventing stu
dents from announcing fictitious
betrothals in The Daily. If your
new regulations fail to prevent
such deplorable hoaxes, I recom
mend that you try loyalty oaths.
Meanwhile, I shall stand firmly
with you on the “bridge” that you
built “between the sometimes
gulf of misunderstanding between
faculty and students.” This bridge
not only “deserves the support of
the Stanford student body,” as
you so rightly declare; it desper
ately needs the support of anyone
who can swim.

Let me thank you, finally, for
your informative editorial on fra
ternities. Until you published it,
I had not appreciated the remark
able qualities of the fraternity
atmosphere. It is comforting to
learn that what had seemed a
stifling air is actually “an atmos
phere which binds real friend
ships.” If the waves in the gulf
should become too rough because
of the ‘ discordant harping” which
some fuzzy-minded professors
have mistaken for the winds of
freedom, this prodigious atmos
phere could be used to tie your
bridge together.

(EDITOR'S NOTE: The Daily
regrets its misquote of Dr. Slone
in its recent editorial on fratern
ities at Stanford. The error re
sulted from the fact, that The
Daily wished to use Dr. Stone’s
words, as he applied them to
Stern, to the fraternity system.
Unfortunately, The Daily, due to
a copyreading mistake did not
state the above in the editorial.)

Analysis Errors

While there exists legitimate di
vision of opinion with regard to
economic policy, we feel that
blatant errors of analysis, when
they appear in print, should be
pointed out. Your editorial of
April 12 is the case in point. Apart
from violations of basic principles
of logic, the editorial appears to
have been written by someone
who is completely oblivious to
elementary economics.

While we could, and perhaps
should, attempt to take advantage
of the recent temporary suspen
sion of the 250-word maximum on
letters to the editor, we feel that
it is sufficient to point out briefly
the following glaring errors:
1) Economic aid to depressed
areas does not necessarily con
flict with the progress of other
sectors of the economy; indeed,
there is strong reason to believe
that such aid would stimulate the
demand for goods and services
produced in other regions.
2) Grants to depressed areas
which are used for the construc
tion of plant and equipment ap
pear to be in few cases analogous
to the federal agriculture aid pro
gram. Indeed, the most rapidly
growing regions in the Western
Hemisphere have made extensive
use of government aid in capital
formation. Puerto Rico and Mex
ico are excellent examples.

3) While tax cuts are indeed
the most desirable method of rais
ing employment consistent with
minimizing government interfer
ence with the private sector, the
use of this tool is in no way de
pendent upon the existence of a
budget surplus.
The opinions expressed in the
editorial, we feel, indicate that
the editor has failed to cross the
pons asinorum of sophomore eco
nomics. Should the editor he
under the false impression that
all economic departments are
completely out of step with the
real world, we suggest recourse
to such a basic treatise as Adam
Smith's “Wealth of Nations.”

vision of opinion with regard to
economic policy, we feel that
blatant errors of analysis, when
they appear in print, should be
pointed out. Your editorial of
April 12 is the case in point. Apart
from violations of basic principles
of logic, the editorial appears to
have been written by someone
who is completely oblivious to
elementary economics.

While we could, and perhaps
should, attempt to take advantage
of the recent temporary suspen
sion of the 250-word maximum on
letters to the editor, we feel that
it is sufficient to point out briefly
the following glaring errors:
1) Economic aid to depressed
areas does not necessarily con
flict with the progress of other
sectors of the economy; indeed,
there is strong reason to believe
that such aid would stimulate the
demand for goods and services
produced in other regions.
2) Grants to depressed areas
which are used for the construc
tion of plant and equipment ap
pear to be in few cases analogous
to the federal agriculture aid pro
gram. Indeed, the most rapidly
growing regions in the Western
Hemisphere have made extensive
use of government aid in capital
formation. Puerto Rico and Mex
ico are excellent examples.

3) While tax cuts are indeed
the most desirable method of rais
ing employment consistent with
minimizing government interfer
ence with the private sector, the
use of this tool is in no way de
pendent upon the existence of a
budget surplus.
The opinions expressed in the
editorial, we feel, indicate that
the editor has failed to cross the
pons asinorum of sophomore eco
nomics. Should the editor he
under the false impression that
all economic departments are
completely out of step with the
real world, we suggest recourse
to such a basic treatise as Adam
Smith's “Wealth of Nations.”

My colleague Wilfred Stone cer
tainly showed poor sportsman
ship in response to your demon
stration that his words could be
used to mean the reverse of what
he meant when he wrote them. I
am glad that you refused to let
his protest distract any of your
moral attention from the far more
serious issue of preventing stu
dents from announcing fictitious
betrothals in The Daily. If your
new regulations fail to prevent
such deplorable hoaxes, I recom
mend that you try loyalty oaths.
Meanwhile, I shall stand firmly
with you on the “bridge” that you
built “between the sometimes
gulf of misunderstanding between
faculty and students.” This bridge
not only “deserves the support of
the Stanford student body,” as
you so rightly declare; it desper
ately needs the support of anyone
who can swim.

Let me thank you, finally, for
your informative editorial on fra
ternities. Until you published it,
I had not appreciated the remark
able qualities of the fraternity
atmosphere. It is comforting to
learn that what had seemed a
stifling air is actually “an atmos
phere which binds real friend
ships.” If the waves in the gulf
should become too rough because
of the ‘ discordant harping” which
some fuzzy-minded professors
have mistaken for the winds of
freedom, this prodigious atmos
phere could be used to tie your
bridge together.
