## Khrushchev Tells Of Cuban Policy 
### 
In this article I shall put to-,
gether those parts of the talk
which dealt with the revolution
ary movements among small na
tions. Mr. Khrushchev spoke spe
cifically of three of them Laos,
Cuba, and Iran. But for him these
three are merely examples of
what he regards as a worldwide
and historic revolutionary move
ment—akin to the change from
feudalism to capitalism—which is
surely destined to bring the old
colonial countries into the Com
munist orbit. I could delect no
doubt or reservation in his mind
that this will surely happen, that
there is no alternative, that while

he will help this
manifest destiny
and while we
will oppose it,
the destiny
would be rea
lized no matter
what either of us
did.
S pea king of
Iran, which he
did without my
raising the sub

ject, he said that Iran had a very
weak Communist Party but that
nevertheless the misery of the
masses and the corruption of the
government was surely producing
a revolution. “You will assert,” he
said, “that the Shah has been
overthrown by the Communists,
and we shall be very glad to have
it thought in the world that all the
progressive people in Iran recog
nize that we are the leaders of
the progress of mankind.”
JUDGING by the general tenor
of what he said about Iran, it
is not contemplating military in
would be fair to conclude that he
tervention and occupation—“lran
is a poor country which is of no
use to the Soviet Union”—but
that he will do all he can by prop
aganda and indirect intervention
to bring down the Shah.
In his mind, Iran is the most
immediate example of the inevita
ble movement of history in which
he believes so completely. He
would not admit that we can di
vert this historic movement by
championing liberal democratic
reforms. Nothing that any of us
can say can change his mind,
which is that of a true believer,
except a demonstration in some
country that we can promote deep
democratic reforms.
His attitude toward Cuba is
based on this same dogma. Cas
tro’s revolution is inevitable and
predetermined. It was not made
by the Soviet Union but by the

i history of Cuba, and the Soviet
Union is involved because Castro
appealed for economic help when
(he United States tried to strangle
the revolution with an embargo.
He said blatly. but not I thought
with much passion, that we were
preparing a landing in Cuba, a
landing not with American troops
but with Cubans armed and sup
ported by the United States. He
said that if this happened, the
Soviet Union would “oppose” the
United Slates.
I HOPE I WAS not misled in
understanding him to mean that
he would oppose us by propa
ganda and diplomacy, and that he
did not have in mind military in
tervention. I would in fact go a
bit further, based not on what he
said but on the general tone of
his remarks, that in his book it
is normal for a great power to
undermine an unfriendly govern
ment within its own sphere of in
j terest. He has been doing this
j himself in Laos and Iran and his
i feeling about the American sup
port of subversion in Cuba is al
together different in quality from
his feeling about the encourage
ment of resistance in the satellite
states of Europe. Mr. Khrushchev
thinks much more like Richelieu
and Metternich than like Wood
row Wilson.
I had an overall impression that
his primary interest is not in the
cold war about the small and
I underdeveloped countries. The
support of the revolutionary
i movement among these countries
is for him an interesting, hopeful,
agreeable opportunity, but it is
not a vital interest in the sense
that he would go to war about it.
He is quite sure that he will win
this cold war without military
force because he is on the side of
history, and because he has the
military power to deter us from
I a serious military intervention.
His primary concern is with the
strong countries, especially with
the United States, Germany, and
China. I could not ask him diiect
questions about China. But there
is no doubt that in his calculations
of world power, China is a major
factor. I felt that he thought of
China as a problem of the future,
and that may be one of the rea
sons why tor him the immediate
and passionate questions have to
do with Germany and disarma
ment.
FOR THE present I should add
a few miscellaneous impressions.
During our walk after lunch. Mi
koyan being with us then, I tried
to find out what they thought of

President Kennedy’s purpose to
bring the American economy not
only out of the current recession,
but out of its chronic sluggish
ness, For quite evidently, much of
his buoyant confidence in the his
toric destiny of the Soviet Union
is based on the undoubted ma
terial progress of Soviet industry
as compared with our slow rate
of growth.
To Mr. Khrushchev it was cer
tain that President Kennedy can
not succeed in accelerating Amer
ican economic growth. He had, he
(old me, explained that to Mrs.
Roosevelt when he was in New
York during the American elec
tion. Why can’t President Ken
nedy succeed? Because, he said, of
“Rockefeller,” and then added,
“DuPont.” They will not let him.
This was, it appears, one of those
truths that cannot he doubted by
any sane man.
None of this, however, was said
with any personal animus against
President Kennedy. Rather it was
said as one might speak of the
seasons and the tides and about
mortality, about natural events
which man does not control.
While he has no confidence in the
New Frontier, he has obvious re
spect for the President person
ally, though he confessed he
could hardly understand how any
man who had not been in a big
government for a long time could
suddenly become the head of it.
Moreover, as I shall report 'tomor
row in talking about the German
question, it is clear, I think, that
he looks forward to another round
of international negotiations be
fore he precipitates a crisis over
Berlin.
