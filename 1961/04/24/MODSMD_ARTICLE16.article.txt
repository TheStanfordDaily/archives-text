# Trojans Preserve String, Top OSC, Indian Spikers
## 
### RON RAPOPORT 
You will be pleased not to say
“Like a duck takes to water” to
Oregon track Coach Bill Bower
man, because his Ducks took not
at all well to the rains In the
Stadium Saturday.
Southern Cal’s trackmen, on the
other hand, acted like they’d been
playing in the mud all their lives
and the Trojans kept their re
markable string of track victories
alive. Stanford was there too, but.
as predicted, went almost un
noticed among the rush of greats
and near greats competing for
the two visitors.

THE FINAL scoring for the
triangular went SSL.-Gl-ITD with
the Trojans on top and the Indi
ans underneath. In the celebrated
dual meet between Oregon and
SC the Southerners won their
9Gth straight downing the Ducks
73-58. Oregon beat Stanford 90-
38 in the dual and SC trounced the
Tribe 104-25.

The promise of rain which kept
its word sporadically during the
meet kept (he crowd down to
about 8,500. That, however, is still
a goodly number and is more than
came to a similarly rain-threat
ened football game hero last fall.

For Stanford there was only
one bright spot as the few other
possibilities for the Indian wins
didn’t quite work out.
DAVE WEILL, huge Stanford
sophomore, set a school rcord in
(he discus with a toss of 175-0.
That’s nearly five feet better than
his all-time best and Weill looks
to be on his way to big things.

Trojan sophomore Rex Cawley
was the outstanding performer of
the flay as he set a Stadium rec
ord in the 440, won the low hur
dles while almost running back
wards, and anchored SC’s winning
mile relay lap.
In the 440 the smooth-moving
Cawley took an early lead and
was never threatened. He finished
15 yards ahead of teammate
Kevin Hogan. Cawley’s 46.3 broke
the Stadium record of 46.6 set in
1941 by Hubie Kearns.

THE BEST of the 440 times
weren’t bad either as Hogan fin
ished in 47.8, Bobby Staten, also
of the Trojans, ran 48.5 and Ore
gon’s Jim Puckett went 48.8.
In the 220 lows Cawley again
took a commanding lead and,
after clearing the last hurdle,
looked behind him, saw that no
body was close and trotted to
the finish line. His time was 23.4,
still good enough for a triangular

record and an Oregon-SC dual
meet record.

DALLAS LONG, SC’s great
shot-putter, heaved the hall 63-9
on his first attempt and then
loafed home as nobody else came
within three yards of his throw.

Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s Olym
pic middle distance star, won the
mile handily in 4:11.5. Stanford’s
John Northway led for the first
three laps, sometimes by as much
as 40 yards, but at the end of the
third go-around he was passed by
Burleson and fellow Oregonians
Keith Forman and George Larson
who finished one-two-three.
Northway finished fourth in
4:24.3.

Oregon’s Harry Jerome won the
100 as expected in 9.6. SC’s Jim
Bates and Bruce Munn finished
second and third, bolh timed in
9.7.

It was the same three in the
220 but in reverse order. The two
Trojans and Jerome fought it out
down to the wire but Munn was
tlie winner in 21.5 with Bates
second in an identical time and
Jerome third in 21.6.

SC’S 808 AVANT won the high
jump with no trouble at 6-814. Bob
Sbordone of the Trojans, took the
javelin with a loss of 217-4 Vi as
Stanford’s Art Batchelder, who
has been out past 230 feet this
year, faltered with a fourth-place
at 209-4.

In the two-mile Oregon’s Vic
Reeve and George Larson gave
the crowd a taste of togetherness
as they finished ahead of the pack
holding hands. With one lap to go
Reeve slowed down to let Larson
catch up and shouted “Tie.” Lar
son was willing and they tried
crossing the finish line together.
The unimpressed judges called
Reeve the winner, however, al
though they both finished in a
slow 9:50.7.
OREGON’S Jerry Close look
the broad jump with 24-4 as Stan
ford’s Dan Moore finished third
with 24-10%. Moore, who was out
to 25-1 last week, looked like ho
might have been past 25 feet
again on his last jump of the day,
but his foot went over the start
ing board and it was declared a
foul jump.
Close also equalled the Stadium
record in the high hurdles at 14.0.
Jim Brewer, the sensational
pole-vaulter for the Figueroa
Technicians, won his event at 14-8,
half a foot under his best for the
year. Stanford’s Phil White fin
ished in a three-way tie for second

with SC’s Mel Hein and Oregon’s
Dari McAllister at 14-0.

You will be pleased not to say
“Like a duck takes to water” to
Oregon track Coach Bill Bower
man, because his Ducks took not
at all well to the rains In the
Stadium Saturday.
Southern Cal’s trackmen, on the
other hand, acted like they’d been
playing in the mud all their lives
and the Trojans kept their re
markable string of track victories
alive. Stanford was there too, but.
as predicted, went almost un
noticed among the rush of greats
and near greats competing for
the two visitors.

THE FINAL scoring for the
triangular went SSL.-Gl-ITD with
the Trojans on top and the Indi
ans underneath. In the celebrated
dual meet between Oregon and
SC the Southerners won their
9Gth straight downing the Ducks
73-58. Oregon beat Stanford 90-
38 in the dual and SC trounced the
Tribe 104-25.

The promise of rain which kept
its word sporadically during the
meet kept (he crowd down to
about 8,500. That, however, is still
a goodly number and is more than
came to a similarly rain-threat
ened football game hero last fall.

For Stanford there was only
one bright spot as the few other
possibilities for the Indian wins
didn’t quite work out.
DAVE WEILL, huge Stanford
sophomore, set a school rcord in
(he discus with a toss of 175-0.
That’s nearly five feet better than
his all-time best and Weill looks
to be on his way to big things.

Trojan sophomore Rex Cawley
was the outstanding performer of
the flay as he set a Stadium rec
ord in the 440, won the low hur
dles while almost running back
wards, and anchored SC’s winning
mile relay lap.
In the 440 the smooth-moving
Cawley took an early lead and
was never threatened. He finished
15 yards ahead of teammate
Kevin Hogan. Cawley’s 46.3 broke
the Stadium record of 46.6 set in
1941 by Hubie Kearns.

THE BEST of the 440 times
weren’t bad either as Hogan fin
ished in 47.8, Bobby Staten, also
of the Trojans, ran 48.5 and Ore
gon’s Jim Puckett went 48.8.
In the 220 lows Cawley again
took a commanding lead and,
after clearing the last hurdle,
looked behind him, saw that no
body was close and trotted to
the finish line. His time was 23.4,
still good enough for a triangular

record and an Oregon-SC dual
meet record.

DALLAS LONG, SC’s great
shot-putter, heaved the hall 63-9
on his first attempt and then
loafed home as nobody else came
within three yards of his throw.

Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s Olym
pic middle distance star, won the
mile handily in 4:11.5. Stanford’s
John Northway led for the first
three laps, sometimes by as much
as 40 yards, but at the end of the
third go-around he was passed by
Burleson and fellow Oregonians
Keith Forman and George Larson
who finished one-two-three.
Northway finished fourth in
4:24.3.

Oregon’s Harry Jerome won the
100 as expected in 9.6. SC’s Jim
Bates and Bruce Munn finished
second and third, bolh timed in
9.7.

It was the same three in the
220 but in reverse order. The two
Trojans and Jerome fought it out
down to the wire but Munn was
tlie winner in 21.5 with Bates
second in an identical time and
Jerome third in 21.6.

SC’S 808 AVANT won the high
jump with no trouble at 6-814. Bob
Sbordone of the Trojans, took the
javelin with a loss of 217-4 Vi as
Stanford’s Art Batchelder, who
has been out past 230 feet this
year, faltered with a fourth-place
at 209-4.

In the two-mile Oregon’s Vic
Reeve and George Larson gave
the crowd a taste of togetherness
as they finished ahead of the pack
holding hands. With one lap to go
Reeve slowed down to let Larson
catch up and shouted “Tie.” Lar
son was willing and they tried
crossing the finish line together.
The unimpressed judges called
Reeve the winner, however, al
though they both finished in a
slow 9:50.7.
OREGON’S Jerry Close look
the broad jump with 24-4 as Stan
ford’s Dan Moore finished third
with 24-10%. Moore, who was out
to 25-1 last week, looked like ho
might have been past 25 feet
again on his last jump of the day,
but his foot went over the start
ing board and it was declared a
foul jump.
Close also equalled the Stadium
record in the high hurdles at 14.0.
Jim Brewer, the sensational
pole-vaulter for the Figueroa
Technicians, won his event at 14-8,
half a foot under his best for the
year. Stanford’s Phil White fin
ished in a three-way tie for second

with SC’s Mel Hein and Oregon’s
Dari McAllister at 14-0.

Stanford 25; Oregon 90, Stanford 38.
You will be pleased not to say
“Like a duck takes to water” to
Oregon track Coach Bill Bower
man, because his Ducks took not
at all well to the rains In the
Stadium Saturday.
Southern Cal’s trackmen, on the
other hand, acted like they’d been
playing in the mud all their lives
and the Trojans kept their re
markable string of track victories
alive. Stanford was there too, but.
as predicted, went almost un
noticed among the rush of greats
and near greats competing for
the two visitors.

THE FINAL scoring for the
triangular went SSL.-Gl-ITD with
the Trojans on top and the Indi
ans underneath. In the celebrated
dual meet between Oregon and
SC the Southerners won their
9Gth straight downing the Ducks
73-58. Oregon beat Stanford 90-
38 in the dual and SC trounced the
Tribe 104-25.

The promise of rain which kept
its word sporadically during the
meet kept (he crowd down to
about 8,500. That, however, is still
a goodly number and is more than
came to a similarly rain-threat
ened football game hero last fall.

For Stanford there was only
one bright spot as the few other
possibilities for the Indian wins
didn’t quite work out.
DAVE WEILL, huge Stanford
sophomore, set a school rcord in
(he discus with a toss of 175-0.
That’s nearly five feet better than
his all-time best and Weill looks
to be on his way to big things.

Trojan sophomore Rex Cawley
was the outstanding performer of
the flay as he set a Stadium rec
ord in the 440, won the low hur
dles while almost running back
wards, and anchored SC’s winning
mile relay lap.
In the 440 the smooth-moving
Cawley took an early lead and
was never threatened. He finished
15 yards ahead of teammate
Kevin Hogan. Cawley’s 46.3 broke
the Stadium record of 46.6 set in
1941 by Hubie Kearns.

THE BEST of the 440 times
weren’t bad either as Hogan fin
ished in 47.8, Bobby Staten, also
of the Trojans, ran 48.5 and Ore
gon’s Jim Puckett went 48.8.
In the 220 lows Cawley again
took a commanding lead and,
after clearing the last hurdle,
looked behind him, saw that no
body was close and trotted to
the finish line. His time was 23.4,
still good enough for a triangular

record and an Oregon-SC dual
meet record.

DALLAS LONG, SC’s great
shot-putter, heaved the hall 63-9
on his first attempt and then
loafed home as nobody else came
within three yards of his throw.

Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s Olym
pic middle distance star, won the
mile handily in 4:11.5. Stanford’s
John Northway led for the first
three laps, sometimes by as much
as 40 yards, but at the end of the
third go-around he was passed by
Burleson and fellow Oregonians
Keith Forman and George Larson
who finished one-two-three.
Northway finished fourth in
4:24.3.

Oregon’s Harry Jerome won the
100 as expected in 9.6. SC’s Jim
Bates and Bruce Munn finished
second and third, bolh timed in
9.7.

It was the same three in the
220 but in reverse order. The two
Trojans and Jerome fought it out
down to the wire but Munn was
tlie winner in 21.5 with Bates
second in an identical time and
Jerome third in 21.6.

SC’S 808 AVANT won the high
jump with no trouble at 6-814. Bob
Sbordone of the Trojans, took the
javelin with a loss of 217-4 Vi as
Stanford’s Art Batchelder, who
has been out past 230 feet this
year, faltered with a fourth-place
at 209-4.

In the two-mile Oregon’s Vic
Reeve and George Larson gave
the crowd a taste of togetherness
as they finished ahead of the pack
holding hands. With one lap to go
Reeve slowed down to let Larson
catch up and shouted “Tie.” Lar
son was willing and they tried
crossing the finish line together.
The unimpressed judges called
Reeve the winner, however, al
though they both finished in a
slow 9:50.7.
OREGON’S Jerry Close look
the broad jump with 24-4 as Stan
ford’s Dan Moore finished third
with 24-10%. Moore, who was out
to 25-1 last week, looked like ho
might have been past 25 feet
again on his last jump of the day,
but his foot went over the start
ing board and it was declared a
foul jump.
Close also equalled the Stadium
record in the high hurdles at 14.0.
Jim Brewer, the sensational
pole-vaulter for the Figueroa
Technicians, won his event at 14-8,
half a foot under his best for the
year. Stanford’s Phil White fin
ished in a three-way tie for second

with SC’s Mel Hein and Oregon’s
Dari McAllister at 14-0.

You will be pleased not to say
“Like a duck takes to water” to
Oregon track Coach Bill Bower
man, because his Ducks took not
at all well to the rains In the
Stadium Saturday.
Southern Cal’s trackmen, on the
other hand, acted like they’d been
playing in the mud all their lives
and the Trojans kept their re
markable string of track victories
alive. Stanford was there too, but.
as predicted, went almost un
noticed among the rush of greats
and near greats competing for
the two visitors.

THE FINAL scoring for the
triangular went SSL.-Gl-ITD with
the Trojans on top and the Indi
ans underneath. In the celebrated
dual meet between Oregon and
SC the Southerners won their
9Gth straight downing the Ducks
73-58. Oregon beat Stanford 90-
38 in the dual and SC trounced the
Tribe 104-25.

The promise of rain which kept
its word sporadically during the
meet kept (he crowd down to
about 8,500. That, however, is still
a goodly number and is more than
came to a similarly rain-threat
ened football game hero last fall.

For Stanford there was only
one bright spot as the few other
possibilities for the Indian wins
didn’t quite work out.
DAVE WEILL, huge Stanford
sophomore, set a school rcord in
(he discus with a toss of 175-0.
That’s nearly five feet better than
his all-time best and Weill looks
to be on his way to big things.

Trojan sophomore Rex Cawley
was the outstanding performer of
the flay as he set a Stadium rec
ord in the 440, won the low hur
dles while almost running back
wards, and anchored SC’s winning
mile relay lap.
In the 440 the smooth-moving
Cawley took an early lead and
was never threatened. He finished
15 yards ahead of teammate
Kevin Hogan. Cawley’s 46.3 broke
the Stadium record of 46.6 set in
1941 by Hubie Kearns.

THE BEST of the 440 times
weren’t bad either as Hogan fin
ished in 47.8, Bobby Staten, also
of the Trojans, ran 48.5 and Ore
gon’s Jim Puckett went 48.8.
In the 220 lows Cawley again
took a commanding lead and,
after clearing the last hurdle,
looked behind him, saw that no
body was close and trotted to
the finish line. His time was 23.4,
still good enough for a triangular

record and an Oregon-SC dual
meet record.

DALLAS LONG, SC’s great
shot-putter, heaved the hall 63-9
on his first attempt and then
loafed home as nobody else came
within three yards of his throw.

Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s Olym
pic middle distance star, won the
mile handily in 4:11.5. Stanford’s
John Northway led for the first
three laps, sometimes by as much
as 40 yards, but at the end of the
third go-around he was passed by
Burleson and fellow Oregonians
Keith Forman and George Larson
who finished one-two-three.
Northway finished fourth in
4:24.3.

Oregon’s Harry Jerome won the
100 as expected in 9.6. SC’s Jim
Bates and Bruce Munn finished
second and third, bolh timed in
9.7.

It was the same three in the
220 but in reverse order. The two
Trojans and Jerome fought it out
down to the wire but Munn was
tlie winner in 21.5 with Bates
second in an identical time and
Jerome third in 21.6.

SC’S 808 AVANT won the high
jump with no trouble at 6-814. Bob
Sbordone of the Trojans, took the
javelin with a loss of 217-4 Vi as
Stanford’s Art Batchelder, who
has been out past 230 feet this
year, faltered with a fourth-place
at 209-4.

In the two-mile Oregon’s Vic
Reeve and George Larson gave
the crowd a taste of togetherness
as they finished ahead of the pack
holding hands. With one lap to go
Reeve slowed down to let Larson
catch up and shouted “Tie.” Lar
son was willing and they tried
crossing the finish line together.
The unimpressed judges called
Reeve the winner, however, al
though they both finished in a
slow 9:50.7.
OREGON’S Jerry Close look
the broad jump with 24-4 as Stan
ford’s Dan Moore finished third
with 24-10%. Moore, who was out
to 25-1 last week, looked like ho
might have been past 25 feet
again on his last jump of the day,
but his foot went over the start
ing board and it was declared a
foul jump.
Close also equalled the Stadium
record in the high hurdles at 14.0.
Jim Brewer, the sensational
pole-vaulter for the Figueroa
Technicians, won his event at 14-8,
half a foot under his best for the
year. Stanford’s Phil White fin
ished in a three-way tie for second

with SC’s Mel Hein and Oregon’s
Dari McAllister at 14-0.

You will be pleased not to say
“Like a duck takes to water” to
Oregon track Coach Bill Bower
man, because his Ducks took not
at all well to the rains In the
Stadium Saturday.
Southern Cal’s trackmen, on the
other hand, acted like they’d been
playing in the mud all their lives
and the Trojans kept their re
markable string of track victories
alive. Stanford was there too, but.
as predicted, went almost un
noticed among the rush of greats
and near greats competing for
the two visitors.

THE FINAL scoring for the
triangular went SSL.-Gl-ITD with
the Trojans on top and the Indi
ans underneath. In the celebrated
dual meet between Oregon and
SC the Southerners won their
9Gth straight downing the Ducks
73-58. Oregon beat Stanford 90-
38 in the dual and SC trounced the
Tribe 104-25.

The promise of rain which kept
its word sporadically during the
meet kept (he crowd down to
about 8,500. That, however, is still
a goodly number and is more than
came to a similarly rain-threat
ened football game hero last fall.

For Stanford there was only
one bright spot as the few other
possibilities for the Indian wins
didn’t quite work out.
DAVE WEILL, huge Stanford
sophomore, set a school rcord in
(he discus with a toss of 175-0.
That’s nearly five feet better than
his all-time best and Weill looks
to be on his way to big things.

Trojan sophomore Rex Cawley
was the outstanding performer of
the flay as he set a Stadium rec
ord in the 440, won the low hur
dles while almost running back
wards, and anchored SC’s winning
mile relay lap.
In the 440 the smooth-moving
Cawley took an early lead and
was never threatened. He finished
15 yards ahead of teammate
Kevin Hogan. Cawley’s 46.3 broke
the Stadium record of 46.6 set in
1941 by Hubie Kearns.

THE BEST of the 440 times
weren’t bad either as Hogan fin
ished in 47.8, Bobby Staten, also
of the Trojans, ran 48.5 and Ore
gon’s Jim Puckett went 48.8.
In the 220 lows Cawley again
took a commanding lead and,
after clearing the last hurdle,
looked behind him, saw that no
body was close and trotted to
the finish line. His time was 23.4,
still good enough for a triangular

record and an Oregon-SC dual
meet record.

DALLAS LONG, SC’s great
shot-putter, heaved the hall 63-9
on his first attempt and then
loafed home as nobody else came
within three yards of his throw.

Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s Olym
pic middle distance star, won the
mile handily in 4:11.5. Stanford’s
John Northway led for the first
three laps, sometimes by as much
as 40 yards, but at the end of the
third go-around he was passed by
Burleson and fellow Oregonians
Keith Forman and George Larson
who finished one-two-three.
Northway finished fourth in
4:24.3.

Oregon’s Harry Jerome won the
100 as expected in 9.6. SC’s Jim
Bates and Bruce Munn finished
second and third, bolh timed in
9.7.

It was the same three in the
220 but in reverse order. The two
Trojans and Jerome fought it out
down to the wire but Munn was
tlie winner in 21.5 with Bates
second in an identical time and
Jerome third in 21.6.

SC’S 808 AVANT won the high
jump with no trouble at 6-814. Bob
Sbordone of the Trojans, took the
javelin with a loss of 217-4 Vi as
Stanford’s Art Batchelder, who
has been out past 230 feet this
year, faltered with a fourth-place
at 209-4.

In the two-mile Oregon’s Vic
Reeve and George Larson gave
the crowd a taste of togetherness
as they finished ahead of the pack
holding hands. With one lap to go
Reeve slowed down to let Larson
catch up and shouted “Tie.” Lar
son was willing and they tried
crossing the finish line together.
The unimpressed judges called
Reeve the winner, however, al
though they both finished in a
slow 9:50.7.
OREGON’S Jerry Close look
the broad jump with 24-4 as Stan
ford’s Dan Moore finished third
with 24-10%. Moore, who was out
to 25-1 last week, looked like ho
might have been past 25 feet
again on his last jump of the day,
but his foot went over the start
ing board and it was declared a
foul jump.
Close also equalled the Stadium
record in the high hurdles at 14.0.
Jim Brewer, the sensational
pole-vaulter for the Figueroa
Technicians, won his event at 14-8,
half a foot under his best for the
year. Stanford’s Phil White fin
ished in a three-way tie for second

with SC’s Mel Hein and Oregon’s
Dari McAllister at 14-0.

OREGON’S Jerry Close look

again on his last jump of the day,
but his foot went over the start

foul jump.
Close also equalled the Stadium
record in the high hurdles at 14.0.
Jim Brewer, the sensational
pole-vaulter for the Figueroa

half a foot under his best for the

You will be pleased not to say
“Like a duck takes to water” to
Oregon track Coach Bill Bower
man, because his Ducks took not
at all well to the rains In the
Stadium Saturday.
Southern Cal’s trackmen, on the
other hand, acted like they’d been
playing in the mud all their lives
and the Trojans kept their re
markable string of track victories
alive. Stanford was there too, but.
as predicted, went almost un
noticed among the rush of greats
and near greats competing for
the two visitors.

THE FINAL scoring for the
triangular went SSL.-Gl-ITD with
the Trojans on top and the Indi
ans underneath. In the celebrated
dual meet between Oregon and
SC the Southerners won their
9Gth straight downing the Ducks
73-58. Oregon beat Stanford 90-
38 in the dual and SC trounced the
Tribe 104-25.

The promise of rain which kept
its word sporadically during the
meet kept (he crowd down to
about 8,500. That, however, is still
a goodly number and is more than
came to a similarly rain-threat
ened football game hero last fall.

For Stanford there was only
one bright spot as the few other
possibilities for the Indian wins
didn’t quite work out.
DAVE WEILL, huge Stanford
sophomore, set a school rcord in
(he discus with a toss of 175-0.
That’s nearly five feet better than
his all-time best and Weill looks
to be on his way to big things.

Trojan sophomore Rex Cawley
was the outstanding performer of
the flay as he set a Stadium rec
ord in the 440, won the low hur
dles while almost running back
wards, and anchored SC’s winning
mile relay lap.
In the 440 the smooth-moving
Cawley took an early lead and
was never threatened. He finished
15 yards ahead of teammate
Kevin Hogan. Cawley’s 46.3 broke
the Stadium record of 46.6 set in
1941 by Hubie Kearns.

THE BEST of the 440 times
weren’t bad either as Hogan fin
ished in 47.8, Bobby Staten, also
of the Trojans, ran 48.5 and Ore
gon’s Jim Puckett went 48.8.
In the 220 lows Cawley again
took a commanding lead and,
after clearing the last hurdle,
looked behind him, saw that no
body was close and trotted to
the finish line. His time was 23.4,
still good enough for a triangular

record and an Oregon-SC dual
meet record.

DALLAS LONG, SC’s great
shot-putter, heaved the hall 63-9
on his first attempt and then
loafed home as nobody else came
within three yards of his throw.

Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s Olym
pic middle distance star, won the
mile handily in 4:11.5. Stanford’s
John Northway led for the first
three laps, sometimes by as much
as 40 yards, but at the end of the
third go-around he was passed by
Burleson and fellow Oregonians
Keith Forman and George Larson
who finished one-two-three.
Northway finished fourth in
4:24.3.

Oregon’s Harry Jerome won the
100 as expected in 9.6. SC’s Jim
Bates and Bruce Munn finished
second and third, bolh timed in
9.7.

It was the same three in the
220 but in reverse order. The two
Trojans and Jerome fought it out
down to the wire but Munn was
tlie winner in 21.5 with Bates
second in an identical time and
Jerome third in 21.6.

SC’S 808 AVANT won the high
jump with no trouble at 6-814. Bob
Sbordone of the Trojans, took the
javelin with a loss of 217-4 Vi as
Stanford’s Art Batchelder, who
has been out past 230 feet this
year, faltered with a fourth-place
at 209-4.

In the two-mile Oregon’s Vic
Reeve and George Larson gave
the crowd a taste of togetherness
as they finished ahead of the pack
holding hands. With one lap to go
Reeve slowed down to let Larson
catch up and shouted “Tie.” Lar
son was willing and they tried
crossing the finish line together.
The unimpressed judges called
Reeve the winner, however, al
though they both finished in a
slow 9:50.7.
OREGON’S Jerry Close look
the broad jump with 24-4 as Stan
ford’s Dan Moore finished third
with 24-10%. Moore, who was out
to 25-1 last week, looked like ho
might have been past 25 feet
again on his last jump of the day,
but his foot went over the start

foul jump.
Close also equalled the Stadium
record in the high hurdles at 14.0.
Jim Brewer, the sensational
pole-vaulter for the Figueroa
Technicians, won his event at 14-8,
half a foot under his best for the
year. Stanford’s Phil White fin

with SC’s Mel Hein and Oregon’s

You will be pleased not to say
“Like a duck takes to water” to
Oregon track Coach Bill Bower
man, because his Ducks took not
at all well to the rains In the
Stadium Saturday.
Southern Cal’s trackmen, on the
other hand, acted like they’d been
playing in the mud all their lives
and the Trojans kept their re
markable string of track victories
alive. Stanford was there too, but.
as predicted, went almost un
noticed among the rush of greats
and near greats competing for
the two visitors.

THE FINAL scoring for the
triangular went SSL.-Gl-ITD with
the Trojans on top and the Indi
ans underneath. In the celebrated
dual meet between Oregon and
SC the Southerners won their
9Gth straight downing the Ducks
73-58. Oregon beat Stanford 90-
38 in the dual and SC trounced the
Tribe 104-25.

The promise of rain which kept
its word sporadically during the
meet kept (he crowd down to
about 8,500. That, however, is still
a goodly number and is more than
came to a similarly rain-threat
ened football game hero last fall.

For Stanford there was only
one bright spot as the few other
possibilities for the Indian wins
didn’t quite work out.
DAVE WEILL, huge Stanford
sophomore, set a school rcord in
(he discus with a toss of 175-0.
That’s nearly five feet better than
his all-time best and Weill looks
to be on his way to big things.

Trojan sophomore Rex Cawley
was the outstanding performer of
the flay as he set a Stadium rec
ord in the 440, won the low hur
dles while almost running back
wards, and anchored SC’s winning
mile relay lap.
In the 440 the smooth-moving
Cawley took an early lead and
was never threatened. He finished
15 yards ahead of teammate
Kevin Hogan. Cawley’s 46.3 broke
the Stadium record of 46.6 set in
1941 by Hubie Kearns.

THE BEST of the 440 times
weren’t bad either as Hogan fin
ished in 47.8, Bobby Staten, also
of the Trojans, ran 48.5 and Ore
gon’s Jim Puckett went 48.8.
In the 220 lows Cawley again
took a commanding lead and,
after clearing the last hurdle,
looked behind him, saw that no
body was close and trotted to
the finish line. His time was 23.4,
still good enough for a triangular

record and an Oregon-SC dual
meet record.

DALLAS LONG, SC’s great
shot-putter, heaved the hall 63-9
on his first attempt and then
loafed home as nobody else came
within three yards of his throw.

Dyrol Burleson, Oregon’s Olym
pic middle distance star, won the
mile handily in 4:11.5. Stanford’s
John Northway led for the first
three laps, sometimes by as much
as 40 yards, but at the end of the
third go-around he was passed by
Burleson and fellow Oregonians
Keith Forman and George Larson
who finished one-two-three.
Northway finished fourth in
4:24.3.

Oregon’s Harry Jerome won the
100 as expected in 9.6. SC’s Jim
Bates and Bruce Munn finished
second and third, bolh timed in
9.7.

It was the same three in the
220 but in reverse order. The two
Trojans and Jerome fought it out
down to the wire but Munn was
tlie winner in 21.5 with Bates
second in an identical time and
Jerome third in 21.6.

SC’S 808 AVANT won the high
jump with no trouble at 6-814. Bob
Sbordone of the Trojans, took the
javelin with a loss of 217-4 Vi as
Stanford’s Art Batchelder, who
has been out past 230 feet this
year, faltered with a fourth-place
at 209-4.

In the two-mile Oregon’s Vic
Reeve and George Larson gave
the crowd a taste of togetherness
as they finished ahead of the pack
holding hands. With one lap to go
Reeve slowed down to let Larson
catch up and shouted “Tie.” Lar
son was willing and they tried
crossing the finish line together.
The unimpressed judges called
Reeve the winner, however, al
though they both finished in a
slow 9:50.7.
OREGON’S Jerry Close look
the broad jump with 24-4 as Stan
ford’s Dan Moore finished third
with 24-10%. Moore, who was out
to 25-1 last week, looked like ho
might have been past 25 feet
again on his last jump of the day,
but his foot went over the start
ing board and it was declared a
foul jump.
Close also equalled the Stadium
record in the high hurdles at 14.0.
Jim Brewer, the sensational
pole-vaulter for the Figueroa
Technicians, won his event at 14-8,
half a foot under his best for the
year. Stanford’s Phil White fin
ished in a three-way tie for second

with SC’s Mel Hein and Oregon’s
Dari McAllister at 14-0.
