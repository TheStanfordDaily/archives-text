### United Press International 
Maury McDermott, a pitcher of
long time service in the Ameri
can League belted a pinch-hit,
three-run double in the ninth in
ning yesterday to start the St.
Louis Cardinals on their way to a
7-4 victory over San Francisco
after the Giants had won the
opener of a doubleheader, 2-1.
The Cards signed McDermott
this spring as a free agent after
he walked into camp and asked
for a job pitching batting prac
tice.
This afternoon the former Red
Sox and Yankee left-hander also
hurled the ninth inning and set
down three in a row to assure re
lief pitcher Lindy McDaniel his
second victory against one loss.

The loss went to Billy Oâ€™Dell,
his first of the year, after he came
on in the ninth then was hoisted
before McDermott got up.
