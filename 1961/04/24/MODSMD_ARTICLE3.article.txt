# Wilbur Hears Sayler Debate Chickering
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
ASSU presidential candi
date Lawry Chickering and Bob
Sayler faced each other in a
“Nixon-Kennedy” debate at Wil
bur Hall last night.
Opening the meeting with a
statement of policy, Chickering
cited the position of the president
on Legislature as the only real is
sue of the campaign. Calling the
president “little more than a con
stitutional monarch,” Chickering
once more called for his removal
as chairman of Legislature and
emphasized the need for more ini
tiating action.
“THE LEGISLATURE should
spend more than 50 per cent of its
time solving problems,” Chicker
ing stated.
In a partial rebuttal, Sayler de
clared, “The school needs a rea
soned approach to self-govern
ment.” This approach, according
to Sayler, is exactly what he has
been trying to accomplish in the
campaign by means of specific
proposals rather than mere indi
cation of problems.
HE THEN defended the posi
tion of the president as chairman
of Legislature by a comparison to
U.S. government. Here, too, he
stated, the president initiates leg
islation indirectly by working
through the legislators.
Asked to comment on the pro
posal regarding the recall of The
Daily editor, both candidates
agreed that this was not the an
swer. They would have instead a
better definition of the editor’s
position.
