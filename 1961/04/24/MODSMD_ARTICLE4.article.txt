# Mud Follies To Start Drive For Con Home
## 
### 
Attention will be focused on
the weatherman this week as
plans for Con Home Week and the
Mud Follies opener set for Sun
day go into the final stage of
preparation.
Whether the opening Follies
will feature mud, sand or merely
damp weeds, it promises to be one
of the most unusual events ever
held on the Stanford campus, ac
cording to Chairman Lee Stephen
son.

And it’s sure to set a lively pace
for the rest of the week, Con
Home Week Chairman Ralph Gil
man added, which will include the
traditional Strawberry Brunch in
Union Court May 3, class ex-com
sponsored tournaments on Quad
and voting for a king and queen
W’ho can be anyone—and anything
—from a dorm janitor to a stray
phython.

To be elected at a penny a vote,
the king and queen, who can be
nominated by any living group or
organization, will be crowned at
a TGIF carnival at Mama's the
afternoon of May 5.
According to Mary Smith and
Tim Wood, chairmen, this con
cluding event will feature the Zo
diacs band, crew chug races (with
men’s, women’s and mixed
events), a raffle for an evening
in San Francisco and various
booths, including the ever-popular
DU dunking booth.
At house meetings tonight, liv
ing groups will have the oppor
tunity to select king and queen
candidates as well as teams for
both the Mud Follies and Carnival
events.

Frosh men and women are
being organized this week by
Steve Burks and Ann Lusignan
for the extensive off-campus solic
itations. While this is an impor
tant part of the drive, on-campus
fund raising in the various living
groups is expected to contribute
greatly to the overall goal of
$12,000.
