# BUT 'DON'T SEND PREACHERS'
## Foreign Students Call Peace Corps Idea OK 
### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
"I think peace perhaps is the new challenge for Americans," re
marked HR Africa Desk head Art Spiegel last night, in an interna
tional students' panel discussion of President Kennedy's Peace Corps.
"I think the idea is very very interesting and I think it has great
possibilities," began Renato Villela of Brazil. "I see the Peace Corps

idea as a teaching thing.” The
discussion was sponsored by the
Community Committee for Inter
national Students.
AGRICULTURAL and medical
assistance is also needed, he add
ed. He felt training was impor
tant to help the people progress,
for “to be really able to do a good
job they will have to understand
the poor people.”
“One of the greatest jobs is to
separate the Idea of propaganda
from the Peace Corps,” he empha
sized.

“I think it is not only an excel
lent idea, but more than this it
fulfills a vital necessity,” re
marked Eduardo Wiesner of Co
lombia. He felt that for Colombia,
agricultural and public health as
sistance were particularly impor
tant.

“I WOULD think they would be
suspicious of anyone,” he de
scribed as the attitude of host
countries to the Peace Corps
agents.
“For East Africa . . . the idea
of the Peace Corps, if you ex
clude the name, is not new,” stat
ed James Maina of Kenya. He
referred to the present system in
Africa, where Britain sends teach
ers. doctors, medical technicians
and other agents under the colo
nial service administration.
"I think first and foremost is
education,” he said, because the
British haven’t sent many teach
ers. He felt there was a particu
lar need for teachers in junior and
secondary schools.
“ANOTHER field I think im
portant is agriculture,” he added.
“Without very much training you
could help a great deal with agri
culture,” particularly in teaching
"simple techniques.”
Peace Corps agents should not
think they are going just as
American ambassadors or they
will bo disappointed, Maina cau
tioned. “Regard yourself more or
less as an individual.”
“We need education, but don’t
send us preachers,” Art Spiegel,
representative of the American
point of view, has hoard from for
eign universities.
“Perhaps the two key words
are initiative and creativity,” ho
said. “We’re going to select serv
ice-oriented rather than success
oriented people.”
Dr. William Allaway, assistant
dean of men, served as moderator
of the panel.
