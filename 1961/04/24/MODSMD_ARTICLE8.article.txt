# $100 MILLION DRIVE
## PACE to Improve Physical Plant for Students 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
last of four articles telling in de
tail how the University will spend
the SIOO million it plans to get in
the PACE campaign.)
While much of the money to
be raised in the three-year PACE
drive will go for building new, or
remodeling old, classroom and of
fice facilities, a large amount also
will be used for such things as
new dormitories, a new Health
Service building, a faculty club
and other activity buildings.
Faculty-student activities and
services will draw ,$4,750,000 from
the PACE dollars, of which $l.l
million will be used to completely
remodel the old Union so it can
contain all of the offices associa
ted with the dean of students.
The University explains “Stu
dents will be able to handle all
service matters from admission
through registration, housing, stu
dent financial aid, counselling and
guidance to job placement in one
spot convenient to the student ac
tivity center.”
The deans will move in after
the offices now in the Union shift
to the Tresidder Union construc
tion on which is scheduled to get
underway in the next few months.
QUAD SPACE now occupied by
some of the student affairs of
fices will be released for use by
academic departments, primarily
in the humanities or social sci

onces.
Men’s athletic buildings will get
$1,750,000 for construction of a
long-needed gymnasium, with ade
quate seating capacity and flexi
ble design permitting its use for
a variety of athletic activities.
The University notes that the
new gym “will bo the first step in
a long range program of expan
sion and rehabilitation of athletic
facilities.”
ANOTHER long-awaited and al
most legendary student building
is the student publications build
ing, set to cost $300,000 —$50,000
of which will come from the four
student publications’ building and
other funds.
Thus, The Daily. Quad and
Chaparral will be able to move
out of their shaky shacks and
under one roof in a building which
will adjoin the Stanford Press on
the spot where The Daily Shack
is now.
The Sequoia also will join the
three other publications, vacating
its quarters in a “temporary”
building behind Cubberley.
A FACULTY club to bo con
structed between Bowman Alum
ni House and Roble will cost
$900,000. Officials hope “11 will
provide a meeting place for the
ideas of many disciplines, and the
kind of center which helps to
build faculty esprit essential to a
vital university.”
A new facility for the Health
Service will run $750,000 to “pro
vide the initial phase of an ex

pandable building to include phy
sicians’ offices, treatment rooms
and a small infirmary.”
Student residences will receive
$0,450,000, with $5,050,000 going
for new student residences.
UNDERLINING the seriousness
of the housing situation, Stanford
officials say there has been since
World War II “an increase of only
20 per cent: in student living ac
commodations while student pop
ulation was growing 130 per cent.
These factors combine to jeopar
dize Stanford’s status as a resi
dence university.”
Living units for 800 undergrad
uates will be built under the
PACE program.
Each house will hold 50 stu
dents. Although four such houses
will be served from a common
kitchen, each house will include
its own dining room, house li
brary, lounges, conference rooms,
quiet areas and quarters for resi
dent directors and assistants.
“ASSOCIATED faculty dwel
lings will be provided to make
possible a dynamic house pro
gram,” the University reports. A
new twist is that two groups of
four units will be built for under
graduate men and women, who
will share common dining rooms.
Another two groups will house
eight fraternities, replacing the
decrepit Row houses facing con
demnation. This will bring to 16
the number of fraternities in new
University housing.
Another dormitory to house 200

graduate students will be con
structed east of Toyon Hall.
TOTAL COST of all these units
will be $7.9 million, with $2,850,-
000 to bo asked of federal housing
loan funds, to bo repaid from
rental income.
“In order to bring to the older
residences the advantages being
incorporated in new buildings, a
program of remodeling of older
units will be undertaken,” the
University says.
Libraries, faculty residences
and other facilities will be added.
This will cost $1.4 million.
NOTING "the campus is served
today by a system (of roads, util
ities, etc.) geared to the pre-war
University community,” officials
plan to improve fire protection,
utilities, drains and sewers W'ith
PACE money.
“The roadw'ay and parking sys
tem will be modified with the aim
of keeping automobiles away
from the growing central core of
the campus.”
These facilities will cost $l,-
750,000.

Finally, during the three years
of the PACE drive, the University
will spend $5.5 million yearly on
continued support for the follow
ing programs: faculty—s3so,ooo
per year; research—s2 million;
student aid $1 million; library
and other—slso,ooo; and general
unrestricted support—s2 million.

This, then, is how Stanford
plans to spend its 100 piillion
PACE dollars.

dents. Although four such houses
will be served from a common
kitchen, each house will include
its own dining room, house li
brary, lounges, conference rooms,
quiet areas and quarters for resi
dent directors and assistants.
“ASSOCIATED faculty dwel
lings will be provided to make
possible a dynamic house pro
gram,” the University reports. A
new twist is that two groups of
four units will be built for under
graduate men and women, who
will share common dining rooms.
Another two groups will house
eight fraternities, replacing the
decrepit Row houses facing con
demnation. This will bring to 16
the number of fraternities in new
University housing.
Another dormitory to house 200

graduate students will be con
structed east of Toyon Hall.
TOTAL COST of all these units
will be $7.9 million, with $2,850,-
000 to bo asked of federal housing
loan funds, to bo repaid from
rental income.
“In order to bring to the older
residences the advantages being
incorporated in new buildings, a
program of remodeling of older
units will be undertaken,” the
University says.
Libraries, faculty residences
and other facilities will be added.
This will cost $1.4 million.
NOTING "the campus is served
today by a system (of roads, util
ities, etc.) geared to the pre-war
University community,” officials
plan to improve fire protection,
utilities, drains and sewers W'ith
PACE money.
“The roadw'ay and parking sys
tem will be modified with the aim
of keeping automobiles away
from the growing central core of
the campus.”
These facilities will cost $l,-
750,000.

Finally, during the three years
of the PACE drive, the University
will spend $5.5 million yearly on
continued support for the follow
ing programs: faculty—s3so,ooo
per year; research—s2 million;
student aid $1 million; library
and other—slso,ooo; and general
unrestricted support—s2 million.

This, then, is how Stanford
plans to spend its 100 piillion
PACE dollars.
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
last of four articles telling in de
tail how the University will spend
the SIOO million it plans to get in
the PACE campaign.)
While much of the money to
be raised in the three-year PACE
drive will go for building new, or
remodeling old, classroom and of
fice facilities, a large amount also
will be used for such things as
new dormitories, a new Health
Service building, a faculty club
and other activity buildings.
Faculty-student activities and
services will draw ,$4,750,000 from
the PACE dollars, of which $l.l
million will be used to completely
remodel the old Union so it can
contain all of the offices associa
ted with the dean of students.
The University explains “Stu
dents will be able to handle all
service matters from admission
through registration, housing, stu
dent financial aid, counselling and
guidance to job placement in one
spot convenient to the student ac
tivity center.”
The deans will move in after
the offices now in the Union shift
to the Tresidder Union construc
tion on which is scheduled to get
underway in the next few months.
QUAD SPACE now occupied by
some of the student affairs of
fices will be released for use by
academic departments, primarily
in the humanities or social sci

onces.
Men’s athletic buildings will get
$1,750,000 for construction of a
long-needed gymnasium, with ade
quate seating capacity and flexi
ble design permitting its use for
a variety of athletic activities.
The University notes that the
new gym “will bo the first step in
a long range program of expan
sion and rehabilitation of athletic
facilities.”
ANOTHER long-awaited and al
most legendary student building
is the student publications build
ing, set to cost $300,000 —$50,000
of which will come from the four
student publications’ building and
other funds.
Thus, The Daily. Quad and
Chaparral will be able to move
out of their shaky shacks and
under one roof in a building which
will adjoin the Stanford Press on
the spot where The Daily Shack
is now.
The Sequoia also will join the
three other publications, vacating
its quarters in a “temporary”
building behind Cubberley.
A FACULTY club to bo con
structed between Bowman Alum
ni House and Roble will cost
$900,000. Officials hope “11 will
provide a meeting place for the
ideas of many disciplines, and the
kind of center which helps to
build faculty esprit essential to a
vital university.”
A new facility for the Health
Service will run $750,000 to “pro
vide the initial phase of an ex

pandable building to include phy
sicians’ offices, treatment rooms
and a small infirmary.”
Student residences will receive
$0,450,000, with $5,050,000 going
for new student residences.
UNDERLINING the seriousness
of the housing situation, Stanford
officials say there has been since
World War II “an increase of only
20 per cent: in student living ac
commodations while student pop
ulation was growing 130 per cent.
These factors combine to jeopar
dize Stanford’s status as a resi
dence university.”
Living units for 800 undergrad
uates will be built under the
PACE program.
Each house will hold 50 stu

will be served from a common

Men’s athletic buildings will get
$1,750,000 for construction of a
long-needed gymnasium, with ade
quate seating capacity and flexi
ble design permitting its use for
a variety of athletic activities.
The University notes that the
new gym “will bo the first step in
a long range program of expan
sion and rehabilitation of athletic
facilities.”
ANOTHER long-awaited and al
most legendary student building
is the student publications build
ing, set to cost $300,000 —$50,000
of which will come from the four
student publications’ building and
other funds.
Thus, The Daily. Quad and
Chaparral will be able to move
out of their shaky shacks and
under one roof in a building which
will adjoin the Stanford Press on
the spot where The Daily Shack
is now.
The Sequoia also will join the
three other publications, vacating
its quarters in a “temporary”
building behind Cubberley.
A FACULTY club to bo con
structed between Bowman Alum
ni House and Roble will cost
$900,000. Officials hope “11 will
provide a meeting place for the
ideas of many disciplines, and the
kind of center which helps to
build faculty esprit essential to a
vital university.”
A new facility for the Health
Service will run $750,000 to “pro
vide the initial phase of an ex

pandable building to include phy
sicians’ offices, treatment rooms
and a small infirmary.”
Student residences will receive
$0,450,000, with $5,050,000 going
for new student residences.
UNDERLINING the seriousness
of the housing situation, Stanford
officials say there has been since
World War II “an increase of only
20 per cent: in student living ac
commodations while student pop
ulation was growing 130 per cent.
These factors combine to jeopar
dize Stanford’s status as a resi
dence university.”
Living units for 800 undergrad
uates will be built under the
PACE program.
Each house will hold 50 stu
dents. Although four such houses
will be served from a common
kitchen, each house will include
its own dining room, house li
brary, lounges, conference rooms,
quiet areas and quarters for resi
dent directors and assistants.
“ASSOCIATED faculty dwel
lings will be provided to make
possible a dynamic house pro
gram,” the University reports. A
new twist is that two groups of
four units will be built for under
graduate men and women, who
will share common dining rooms.
Another two groups will house
eight fraternities, replacing the
decrepit Row houses facing con
demnation. This will bring to 16
the number of fraternities in new
University housing.
Another dormitory to house 200

graduate students will be con
structed east of Toyon Hall.
TOTAL COST of all these units
will be $7.9 million, with $2,850,-
000 to bo asked of federal housing
loan funds, to bo repaid from
rental income.
“In order to bring to the older
residences the advantages being
incorporated in new buildings, a
program of remodeling of older
units will be undertaken,” the
University says.
Libraries, faculty residences
and other facilities will be added.
This will cost $1.4 million.
NOTING "the campus is served
today by a system (of roads, util
ities, etc.) geared to the pre-war
University community,” officials
plan to improve fire protection,
utilities, drains and sewers W'ith
PACE money.
“The roadw'ay and parking sys
tem will be modified with the aim
of keeping automobiles away
from the growing central core of
the campus.”
These facilities will cost $l,-
750,000.

Finally, during the three years
of the PACE drive, the University
will spend $5.5 million yearly on
continued support for the follow
ing programs: faculty—s3so,ooo
per year; research—s2 million;
student aid $1 million; library
and other—slso,ooo; and general
unrestricted support—s2 million.

This, then, is how Stanford
plans to spend its 100 piillion
PACE dollars.
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
last of four articles telling in de
tail how the University will spend
the SIOO million it plans to get in
the PACE campaign.)
While much of the money to
be raised in the three-year PACE
drive will go for building new, or
remodeling old, classroom and of
fice facilities, a large amount also
will be used for such things as
new dormitories, a new Health
Service building, a faculty club
and other activity buildings.
Faculty-student activities and
services will draw ,$4,750,000 from
the PACE dollars, of which $l.l
million will be used to completely
remodel the old Union so it can
contain all of the offices associa
ted with the dean of students.
The University explains “Stu
dents will be able to handle all
service matters from admission
through registration, housing, stu
dent financial aid, counselling and
guidance to job placement in one
spot convenient to the student ac
tivity center.”
The deans will move in after
the offices now in the Union shift
to the Tresidder Union construc
tion on which is scheduled to get
underway in the next few months.
QUAD SPACE now occupied by
some of the student affairs of
fices will be released for use by
