# Paris Guards Against Feared Invasion
## De Gaulle Orders Out Soldiers, Volunteers 
### 
PARIS (UPl)—President Charles De Gaulle, acting under new die*
tatorial powers early this morning girded Paris with troops, police
and civilian volunteers against a feared invasion by insurgent French
paratroops from Algeria.
Rumor circulated shortly before dawn that French radar stations

had picked up planes coming from
Algeria and a Ministry of Infor
mation spokesman said;
“It is not improbable that they
have taken off from Algeria.”
Asked if this meant it was prob
able they had taken off, he said:
“I CAN only say it is not im
probable.”
However, the government an
nounced later it had intercepted
a message from rebel Gen. Mau
rice Challe in Algeria indicating
the French insurgents there held
up the expected air invasion of
France.

Minister of State Andre Mal
raux made the announcement to
citizen loaders asking for arms.
He said the intercepted message
explained why the rebel planes
failed to take off. But he refused
to reveal the reason.

“IF THE insurgents were plan
ning to organize their invasion as
a parade they have lost because
now we have had time to organ
ize.”

The city was tense. April in
Paris became a nightmare.
A regiment of 2.000 loyal troops
and 1,000 civilians, hastily assem
bled and armed, ringed the presi
dential Elysee Palace. Four tanks
pointed guns down the nearby
Champs Elysee. The whole civil
ian populace was urged to turn
out and act as a human Maginot
line should rebel French generals
in Algeria send Foreign Legion
paratroop invaders.

ALL 10 Paris airports—civil
and military—were closed, and
barricades ordered strung across
runways to prevent landings.
An estimated 15,000 soldiers,
riot squad police and gendarmes
all heavily armed turned out as
the Algiers radio boasted that in
surgents held all Algerian air
fields as well as Algiers and three
other cities.

“This evening is not for words
hut for deeds,” said Malraux to
the volunteers at the palace.
THE COMMUNIST Party. De
Gaulle’s bitterest domestic foe,
announced its support of him and
urged “all democrats to rise up
en masse.”

Lights burned into the early
morning in Do Gaulle’s palace
where be implemented his dra
matically proclaimed announce
ment last night that he was as
suming total control over all
phases of French life under “dic
tator” Article 16 of the constitu
tion.

Busses and trucks were lined up
at key intersections to form block
ade points. Fourteen tanks
blocked St. Cloud Bridge leading
to the heart of the city. All minis
tries were well guarded.
FIGHTER planes were ordered
to shoot at unidentified aircraft
refusing to obey instructions and
civilians were urged to report any
suspicious plane landings.
Sirens w'ere to alert the popu
lace if paratroops landed and Pre
mier Michel Debre appealed to
them to fill the streets. Demon
strations of civilians were planned
at airports if landings were made.
The invaders “are ready,” Debre
declared in a broadcast.

Thousands were urged to sur
round the Elysee Palace to help
loyal troops throw back any at
tackers.
