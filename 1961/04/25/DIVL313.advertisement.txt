support
C’mon, Dick! You’re rationaliz
ing. Jockey support' might never
have secured you against the
Emperor*’. But it certainly would
have provided snug protection
against the physical stresses and
strains of your active life. Your
armorer never tailored a coat of
mail more knowingly than Jockey
tailors a brief —from 13 separate,
body-conforming pieces.
1. Other " imitation” briefs (copies of the
original Jockey brand) hare no more
Jockey support than a limp loin cloth.
2. Richard the Lion-Hearted, 1157-99.
surrendered England and a huge ransom
to secure his release from Henry VI.
Get the reel thing. Look for
the name JOCkGU on the waist band
