# Legislature Kills Daily Amendment
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
Legislature last night voted
against placing The Daily editor
recall amendment on this week’s
final election ballot.
The action came after many
LASSU members said they felt
the proposed amendment would
not Ik? approved by the necessary
two-thirds of the students voting.
Several of the legislators said
they had changed their minds and
would cast their ballot against
the amendment if it were put up
for a vote this week.
IN A sometimes-confused spe
cial meeting, the group reversed
the stand it took last Thursday in
ordering the placing on the ballot
of a proposed amendment which
would enable 5 per cent of the
students or two-thirds of LASSU
to call a special election to recall
any Daily editor. Such a regal!
would require two-thirds approval
by those voting to go into effect.
The special meeting was called
because it was discovered that
LASSU had acted illegally last
Thursday in putting the measure
on the ballot.
A provision in the ASSU con
stitution declares that any pro
posed amendment must receive
an okay on “form and style” from
the Political Science Department
and the Law School heads before
LASSU can vote to put it up for
election.
THIS WAS not done before
LASSU voted 18-4 to put the re
call amendment on this week’s
ballot, thus making that action in
valid.
ASSU President Larry Royse
led the opposition to putting the
proposal on the ballot. "I’m con
vinced it would have been de
feated” he said.
Ho said several of those who
presented the proposal last week
had decided they now were
against it and would vote that
way if it appeared on the ballot.
IN ADDITION, several other
members who last week voted for
the amendment said last night
they had changed their minds and
would rather see a detailed plan
submitted later providing for re
call of The Daily editor by some
means—an action not now pos
sible.

Royse noted that he had spent
many hours over the weekend
conferring with students and had
concluded the amendment would
not have drawn the necessary
two-thirds “Yes” vote needed to
put it into the constitution.
Toyon Representative Bill June
said LASSU should vote against
placing the amendment on the
ballot because it might be de
feated putting the situation back
where it started with no progress
made.

HE AND other LASSU mem
bers backed a move to appoint a
committee to study the problem
and come up with a plan making
the head of The Daily subject to
some sort of recall.

Royse then appointed a three
member committee to help him
draft a specific solution which
will be presented to Legislature
presumably later this quarter.
