The lawyers plan to summon
about 30 witnesses from more
than 200 they interviewed. They
hope to finish their presentation

Last week the prosecution had
its turn. It called on two men
who saw the demonstration and
who said they saw Meisenbach

sion at City Hall. It also called
the policeman to the stand.
However, each of them gave
widely varying stories on how
Schaumleffel was struck. All
agreed, however, that the 22-year
old student did hit the officer.

Berman and Charles Garry, said
yesterday they plan to form their
defense by blaming the San Fran
