# Off LASSU
## 
### 
Perhaps the most salient issue
in the present campaign for ASSU
President is whether or not the
president should be taken off
LASSU, leaving his Administra
tive Assistant to chairman the
meetings. My opponent has as
serted that the reason for our re
peatedly ineffectual student gov
ernment is because of a lack of
dedication and strength from the
president.

I disagree. I think it is highly
unlikely that for the past 20 or
30 years we have had, without ex
ception. weak and undedicated
leaders. We must look beyond the
leaders for the answer, and I am
convinced that the reason lies in
a weakness in the structure of our
government, in the fact the presi
dent has been forced to impartial
ly chairman meetings of the Leg
islature.

Student government has been
in the past ineffectual and unde
serving of respect because it has
repeatedly failed to take the initi
ative in solving campus problems.
In the past the president has
spent too much of his time in his
protocol and public relations func
tion and not enough in his initi
ating function.
Just as in our national govern
ment, the ASSU president is the
head of the initiating branch of
student government, and as such
it is job to provide the impetus
for the solutions to problems. But
as chairman of the Legislature, as
as impartial moderator, he can
not express his own opinions. He
must either express them through
his Administrative Assistant or a
legislator or hand over the gavel
(thus stepping down from the
chair).

I believe we are electing the
ASSU President first as an initi
ator and second as a professional
parliamentarian. But before the
president will ever have the re
spect due him or before he will
ever be able to fulfill his initiating
function, he will have to be per
manently in the position to assert
his own positions.
This is a vital issue. I am con
vinced that we must change this
weakness in our government
structure before we can expect
student government to positively
assert itself.
