# Cuban Invasion
## 
### 
Wednesday night I attended an
UR sponsored program on the
Cuban invasion. I had hoped to
hear a discussion in which both
sides of the issue would be pre
sented and defended so that I
could clarify some of my own
thinking. I did, indeed, hear one
Lside ably presented and vehe
mently defended by several dis
tinguished men—who, however,
cast some regrettable doubts on
their intellectual integrity by oc
casionally indulging in emotional
name-calling and charges of
"moral bankniptcy” on the part
of those who see things differ
ently.

Unfortunately, the UR did not
see fit to give any presentation
whatsoever of the other side of
the issue. Perhaps the people in
the HR don’t believe there is an
other side to the issue. But, as
was clear from the audience’s re
action, a number of people do see
aonther side to it. Since the HR
is, or should be, ah objective, im
partial organization, it behooves
them to find able speakers repre
senting both sides of such obvi
ously controversial issues. I hope
that, in the future, the HR will
not so brazenly disregard its obli
gations to itself and to the Uni
versity.
