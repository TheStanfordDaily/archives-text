# No Americites

In last Tuesday’s paper you re
ferred to Mr. Moshe Shamir as
an “Israelite.” I would like to
point out that the English ad
jective that means “coming from
or pertaining to the State of
Israel is “Israeli.” “Israelite.” on
the other hand, is an archaic
synonym for “Jew.” Mr. Shamir
is a Jew as well as an Israeli, but
that was not what you meant. As
a designation of country “Israel
ite” is as wrong as “Americite”
or “Englandese.”
