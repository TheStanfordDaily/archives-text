# Twenty-one Points
## 
### 
The naive aproach to the state
ment of issues and problems
should be left to the responsible
press. The means to the solutions
of these issues and problems is
the platform duty of the candi
dates. I judge the candidates on
| this basis.
There are perhaps four steps
for effective, experienced leader
ship; 1) the defining of the prob
lem, 2) the analysis of the causes
of the problem. 3) the offering of
several solutions, and 4) the
adoption of the best solution.
No president can ever hope to be
successful if he completes only
part of the four steps.
Perhaps Mr. Chickering has
recognized the new problems, I
commend him if he lias (since I
last heard him). If he has found
the solutions to these problems I
salute him; hut on the third and
fourth steps of effective leader
ship, I would feel insecure in
commendation.
The answer to any school prob
lem such as lack of communica
tion or the lack of student interest
and participation lies not in one
solution, but in Several. The presi
dential assistant will not be the
Messiah, nor will extra time for
the president replace competence
and experience. The staging of
Legislature may please the drama
majors and talent scouts, but will
it answer the fundamental prob
lem of “disinterest?” Certainly,
let us try it, but let us also stress
that this is just one solution.
For all of his retorical ability
and competence with language,
Bob has been reflective and of
fered a feasible, practical, and
honest platform in his ideas, but
more important I have faith in
his leadership qualities.
Bob is correctly called the 21
point candidate, for I am sure
there will be 21 solutions daily.
