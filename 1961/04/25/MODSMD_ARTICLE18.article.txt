We, at Stanford, pay approxi
mately $2.25 per classroom hour
in order to hear highly qualified
professors lecture.
As a result of the repair work
going on in Cubberley, Professor
Farmer, despite repeated requests
for quiet during that hour, has
had to dismiss class twice and
has been unable to deliver an un
interrupted lecture since the quar
ter began.
This wastes the students’
money, the professor’s time, and
the artists’ talent. With foresight,
this repair work might have been
undertaken over spring vacation;
with hindsight it might be post
poned until summer.
