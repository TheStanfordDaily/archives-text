## Germany Key Issue For Mr. 'K' 
### 
It was clear to me at the end of
a long talk that in Mr. Khru
shchev’s mind the future of Ger
many is the key question. I
sought first to understand why
he thinks the German problem is
so urgent, and so I asked him
whether, since agreement was so
far off, a standstill of live or ten
years might not be desirable. He
said this was impossible. Why?
Because there must be a German
solution before “Hitler’s generals
with their 12 NATO divisions’’ get
atomic weapons from France and
the United Slates. Before this hap
pens there must he a peace treaty
defining the frontiers of Poland
and Czechoslovakia and stabiliz
ing the existence of the East Ger
man state. Otherwise, West Ger
many will drag NATO into a war

for the unifica-i
tion of Germany
and the restora
tion of the old:
Eastern frontier.!
HIS feeling of,
urgency, then,
springs from
two causes: his’l
need to console!
date the Com-|
munist East Ger-;
man state

known for short as GDR and
second his need to do this before
West Germany is rearmed. He
said several times that he would
soon bring the German question
to a head. Quite evidently, the pos
sibility of nuclear arms for West
Germany is not immediate. Bonn
does not now have the weapons
and although the possibility of it
is real enough, the threat is not
so urgent as to be a matter of a
few months. The more immedia
ately urgent consideration is, no
doubt, the need to stabilize the
East German regime, particularly
in view of the flow of refugees.
My general impression was that
he was firmly resolved, perhaps
irretrievably committed, to a
showdown on the German ques
tion. But it was evident also that
he dreaded the tension—he re
ferred to this several times —and
is still looking for a negotiation
which will work out a postpone
ment and an accommodation.
In the talks it transpired that
he is thinking of the problem as
having three phases.
THE FIRST is what he con
siders the real and also the event
ual solution. He has no hope, how
ever, that the West will now ac
cept it. His thesis is as follows.
The two Germanys cannot be re
united. The West will not agree to
a unified Communist Germany
and the Soviet Union will not
agree to the absorption and de
struction of the GDR by West

Germany. There are in fact two
Germanys. The way to proceed is,
then, to “codify” the status quo in
the form of peace treaties with
what he called the three elements
of Germany. These three elements
are West Germany, East Ger
many, and West Berlin.

This codification would require
de facto but not diplomatic recog
nition of the GDR. It would fix by
international statute the position
of West Berlin as “a free city,”
with its right of access and its in
ternal liberty guaranteed by the
presence of “symbolic contin
gents” of French, British, Ameri
can, and Russian troops, by neu
tral troops under the aegis of the
U.N., and by the signatures of the
two Germanys and the four oc
cupying powers.
As I said above, Mr. Khru
shchev does not expect at this
time to reach this solution. He
has, therefore, a second position
which he called a “fallback" posi
tion. This is essentially that of
the Soviets at the last Geneva con
ference of the foreign ministers.
It would call for a temporary
agreement. In the Russian view
but not in our view this tempor
ary agreement would have a short
and fixed time limit of perhaps
two to three years. During this
time the two German states would
be invited to negotiate on a form
of unification perhaps, though
he did not say so specifically in
this talk, a kind of loose confeder
ation. At the end of the fixed
period of time, if a new agree
ment about West; Berlin along the
lines I have outlined previously
was reached, it would be emobdied
in a treaty. If no agreement was
reached, the legal rights of oc
cupation would lapse.
THIS GERMAN solution was,
as we know, refused by the West.
But if there is to be another
round of negotiations, variants on
it are likely to be the substance of
the bargaining.
If this fails, Mr. Khrushchev’s
third position is that ho will sign
a separate peace treaty with East
Germany. Then the GDR will in
the Soviet view be sovereign over
the lights of access to West Ber
lin. If the Western powers refuse
to do business with the GDR and
use force to enter West Berlin,
then the Soviet government will
use the Red Army to blockade
West Berlin.
Though it would be foolish to
undervalue his determination, the
threat is not quite so fierce as it
sounds. For he most certainly
does not want a military show
down, and “doing business” with
the GDR is a flexible and not a
rigid conception.
I HAVE confined myself strictly
to reporting my understanding of
the Soviet policy on Germany. If
I may venture an opinion of my
own, I would make these points.
First, Mr. Khrushchev will not
precipitate a crisis until he has
had a chance to talk face to face
with President Kennedy.
Second, he will surely sign a
separate peace treaty if he cannot
negotiate a temporary accommo
dation which is described under
his "second position.”
Third, the crucial points which

will determine whether the Ger
man question is resolved by ne
gotiation or goes to a showdown
are whether the prospect of nu
clear arms for Germany increases
or diminishes, and whether or not
we say that the freedom of West
Berlin, to which we are pledged,
can be maintained only by a re
fusal to negotiate about this fu
ture.

1 HAVE been asked many times
since we left the Soviet Union to
come to London whether I found
the whole interview encouraging
or depressing. I found it sobering.
On the one hand, the evidence was
convincing that the USSR is not
contemplating war and is genuine
ly concerned to prevent any crisis,
be it in Laos, in Cuba, or in Ger
many, from being uncontrollable.
On the other hand, there is no
doubt that the Soviet government
has a relentless determination to
foster the revolutionary move
ment in the underdeveloped coun
tries. This relentless determina
tion springs from an unqualified
faith in the pre-destined accept
ance of Communism by the under
developed countries. The Soviet
government has great confidence
in its own military forces. But it
regards them not as an instru
ment of world conquest but as the
guardian against American inter
ference with the predestined
world revolution.

the Soviet view be sovereign over
the lights of access to West Ber

to do business with the GDR and
use force to enter West Berlin,
then the Soviet government will
use the Red Army to blockade
West Berlin.

threat is not quite so fierce as it

does not want a military show
down, and “doing business” with
the GDR is a flexible and not a
rigid conception.
I HAVE confined myself strictly
to reporting my understanding of
the Soviet policy on Germany. If
I may venture an opinion of my
own, I would make these points.
First, Mr. Khrushchev will not
precipitate a crisis until he has
had a chance to talk face to face
with President Kennedy.
Second, he will surely sign a
separate peace treaty if he cannot
negotiate a temporary accommo
dation which is described under
his "second position.”
Third, the crucial points which

will determine whether the Ger
man question is resolved by ne
gotiation or goes to a showdown
are whether the prospect of nu
clear arms for Germany increases
or diminishes, and whether or not
we say that the freedom of West
Berlin, to which we are pledged,
can be maintained only by a re
fusal to negotiate about this fu
ture.

1 HAVE been asked many times
since we left the Soviet Union to
come to London whether I found
the whole interview encouraging
or depressing. I found it sobering.
On the one hand, the evidence was
convincing that the USSR is not
contemplating war and is genuine
ly concerned to prevent any crisis,
be it in Laos, in Cuba, or in Ger
many, from being uncontrollable.
On the other hand, there is no
doubt that the Soviet government
has a relentless determination to
foster the revolutionary move
ment in the underdeveloped coun
tries. This relentless determina
tion springs from an unqualified
faith in the pre-destined accept
ance of Communism by the under
developed countries. The Soviet
government has great confidence
in its own military forces. But it
regards them not as an instru
ment of world conquest but as the
guardian against American inter
ference with the predestined
world revolution.

It was clear to me at the end of
a long talk that in Mr. Khru
shchev’s mind the future of Ger
many is the key question. I
sought first to understand why
he thinks the German problem is
so urgent, and so I asked him
whether, since agreement was so
far off, a standstill of live or ten
years might not be desirable. He
said this was impossible. Why?
Because there must be a German
solution before “Hitler’s generals
with their 12 NATO divisions’’ get
atomic weapons from France and
the United Slates. Before this hap
pens there must he a peace treaty
defining the frontiers of Poland
and Czechoslovakia and stabiliz
ing the existence of the East Ger
man state. Otherwise, West Ger
many will drag NATO into a war

for the unifica-i
tion of Germany
and the restora
tion of the old:
Eastern frontier.!
HIS feeling of,
urgency, then,
springs from
two causes: his’l
need to console!
date the Com-|
munist East Ger-;
man state

known for short as GDR and
second his need to do this before
West Germany is rearmed. He
said several times that he would
soon bring the German question
to a head. Quite evidently, the pos
sibility of nuclear arms for West
Germany is not immediate. Bonn
does not now have the weapons
and although the possibility of it
is real enough, the threat is not
so urgent as to be a matter of a
few months. The more immedia
ately urgent consideration is, no
doubt, the need to stabilize the
East German regime, particularly
in view of the flow of refugees.
My general impression was that
he was firmly resolved, perhaps
irretrievably committed, to a
showdown on the German ques
tion. But it was evident also that
he dreaded the tension—he re
ferred to this several times —and
is still looking for a negotiation
which will work out a postpone
ment and an accommodation.
In the talks it transpired that
he is thinking of the problem as
having three phases.
THE FIRST is what he con
siders the real and also the event
ual solution. He has no hope, how
ever, that the West will now ac
cept it. His thesis is as follows.
The two Germanys cannot be re
united. The West will not agree to
a unified Communist Germany
and the Soviet Union will not
agree to the absorption and de
struction of the GDR by West

Germany. There are in fact two
Germanys. The way to proceed is,
then, to “codify” the status quo in
the form of peace treaties with
what he called the three elements
of Germany. These three elements
are West Germany, East Ger
many, and West Berlin.

This codification would require
de facto but not diplomatic recog
nition of the GDR. It would fix by
international statute the position
of West Berlin as “a free city,”
with its right of access and its in
ternal liberty guaranteed by the
presence of “symbolic contin
gents” of French, British, Ameri
can, and Russian troops, by neu
tral troops under the aegis of the
U.N., and by the signatures of the
two Germanys and the four oc
cupying powers.
As I said above, Mr. Khru
shchev does not expect at this
time to reach this solution. He
has, therefore, a second position
which he called a “fallback" posi
tion. This is essentially that of
the Soviets at the last Geneva con
ference of the foreign ministers.
It would call for a temporary
agreement. In the Russian view
but not in our view this tempor
ary agreement would have a short
and fixed time limit of perhaps
two to three years. During this
time the two German states would
be invited to negotiate on a form
of unification perhaps, though
he did not say so specifically in
this talk, a kind of loose confeder
ation. At the end of the fixed
period of time, if a new agree
ment about West; Berlin along the
lines I have outlined previously
was reached, it would be emobdied
in a treaty. If no agreement was
reached, the legal rights of oc
cupation would lapse.
THIS GERMAN solution was,
as we know, refused by the West.
But if there is to be another
round of negotiations, variants on
it are likely to be the substance of
the bargaining.
If this fails, Mr. Khrushchev’s
third position is that ho will sign
a separate peace treaty with East
Germany. Then the GDR will in
the Soviet view be sovereign over
the lights of access to West Ber

cept it. His thesis is as follows.
The two Germanys cannot be re
united. The West will not agree to
a unified Communist Germany
and the Soviet Union will not
agree to the absorption and de
struction of the GDR by West

Germany. There are in fact two
Germanys. The way to proceed is,
then, to “codify” the status quo in
the form of peace treaties with
what he called the three elements
of Germany. These three elements
are West Germany, East Ger
many, and West Berlin.

This codification would require
de facto but not diplomatic recog
nition of the GDR. It would fix by
international statute the position
of West Berlin as “a free city,”
with its right of access and its in
ternal liberty guaranteed by the
presence of “symbolic contin
gents” of French, British, Ameri
can, and Russian troops, by neu
tral troops under the aegis of the
U.N., and by the signatures of the
two Germanys and the four oc
cupying powers.
As I said above, Mr. Khru
shchev does not expect at this
time to reach this solution. He
has, therefore, a second position
which he called a “fallback" posi
tion. This is essentially that of
the Soviets at the last Geneva con
ference of the foreign ministers.
It would call for a temporary
agreement. In the Russian view
but not in our view this tempor
ary agreement would have a short
and fixed time limit of perhaps
two to three years. During this
time the two German states would
be invited to negotiate on a form
of unification perhaps, though
he did not say so specifically in
this talk, a kind of loose confeder
ation. At the end of the fixed
period of time, if a new agree
ment about West; Berlin along the
lines I have outlined previously
was reached, it would be emobdied
in a treaty. If no agreement was
reached, the legal rights of oc
cupation would lapse.
THIS GERMAN solution was,
as we know, refused by the West.
But if there is to be another
round of negotiations, variants on
it are likely to be the substance of
the bargaining.
If this fails, Mr. Khrushchev’s
third position is that ho will sign
a separate peace treaty with East
Germany. Then the GDR will in
the Soviet view be sovereign over
the lights of access to West Ber
lin. If the Western powers refuse
to do business with the GDR and
use force to enter West Berlin,
then the Soviet government will
use the Red Army to blockade
West Berlin.
Though it would be foolish to
undervalue his determination, the
threat is not quite so fierce as it
sounds. For he most certainly
does not want a military show
down, and “doing business” with
the GDR is a flexible and not a
rigid conception.
I HAVE confined myself strictly
to reporting my understanding of
the Soviet policy on Germany. If
I may venture an opinion of my
own, I would make these points.
First, Mr. Khrushchev will not
precipitate a crisis until he has
had a chance to talk face to face
with President Kennedy.
Second, he will surely sign a
separate peace treaty if he cannot
negotiate a temporary accommo
dation which is described under
his "second position.”
Third, the crucial points which

will determine whether the Ger
man question is resolved by ne
gotiation or goes to a showdown
are whether the prospect of nu
clear arms for Germany increases
or diminishes, and whether or not
we say that the freedom of West
Berlin, to which we are pledged,
can be maintained only by a re
fusal to negotiate about this fu
ture.

1 HAVE been asked many times
since we left the Soviet Union to
come to London whether I found
the whole interview encouraging
or depressing. I found it sobering.
On the one hand, the evidence was
convincing that the USSR is not
contemplating war and is genuine
ly concerned to prevent any crisis,
be it in Laos, in Cuba, or in Ger
many, from being uncontrollable.
On the other hand, there is no
doubt that the Soviet government
has a relentless determination to
foster the revolutionary move
ment in the underdeveloped coun
tries. This relentless determina
tion springs from an unqualified
faith in the pre-destined accept
ance of Communism by the under
developed countries. The Soviet
government has great confidence
in its own military forces. But it
regards them not as an instru
ment of world conquest but as the
guardian against American inter
ference with the predestined
world revolution.

It was clear to me at the end of
a long talk that in Mr. Khru
shchev’s mind the future of Ger
many is the key question. I
sought first to understand why
he thinks the German problem is
so urgent, and so I asked him
whether, since agreement was so
far off, a standstill of live or ten
years might not be desirable. He
said this was impossible. Why?
Because there must be a German
solution before “Hitler’s generals
with their 12 NATO divisions’’ get
atomic weapons from France and
the United Slates. Before this hap
pens there must he a peace treaty
defining the frontiers of Poland
and Czechoslovakia and stabiliz
ing the existence of the East Ger
man state. Otherwise, West Ger
many will drag NATO into a war

for the unifica-i
tion of Germany
and the restora
tion of the old:
Eastern frontier.!
HIS feeling of,
urgency, then,
springs from
two causes: his’l
need to console!
date the Com-|
munist East Ger-;
man state

known for short as GDR and
second his need to do this before
West Germany is rearmed. He
said several times that he would
soon bring the German question
to a head. Quite evidently, the pos
sibility of nuclear arms for West
Germany is not immediate. Bonn
does not now have the weapons
and although the possibility of it
is real enough, the threat is not
so urgent as to be a matter of a
few months. The more immedia
ately urgent consideration is, no
doubt, the need to stabilize the
East German regime, particularly
in view of the flow of refugees.
My general impression was that
he was firmly resolved, perhaps
irretrievably committed, to a
showdown on the German ques
tion. But it was evident also that
he dreaded the tension—he re
ferred to this several times —and
is still looking for a negotiation
which will work out a postpone
ment and an accommodation.
In the talks it transpired that
he is thinking of the problem as
having three phases.
THE FIRST is what he con
siders the real and also the event
ual solution. He has no hope, how
ever, that the West will now ac
cept it. His thesis is as follows.

and the Soviet Union will not

It was clear to me at the end of
a long talk that in Mr. Khru
shchev’s mind the future of Ger
many is the key question. I
sought first to understand why
he thinks the German problem is
so urgent, and so I asked him
whether, since agreement was so
far off, a standstill of live or ten
years might not be desirable. He
said this was impossible. Why?
Because there must be a German
solution before “Hitler’s generals
with their 12 NATO divisions’’ get
atomic weapons from France and
the United Slates. Before this hap
pens there must he a peace treaty
defining the frontiers of Poland
and Czechoslovakia and stabiliz
ing the existence of the East Ger
man state. Otherwise, West Ger
many will drag NATO into a war

for the unifica-i
tion of Germany
and the restora
tion of the old:
Eastern frontier.!
HIS feeling of,
urgency, then,
springs from
two causes: his’l
need to console!
date the Com-|
munist East Ger-;
man state

known for short as GDR and
second his need to do this before
West Germany is rearmed. He
said several times that he would
soon bring the German question
to a head. Quite evidently, the pos
sibility of nuclear arms for West
Germany is not immediate. Bonn
does not now have the weapons
and although the possibility of it
is real enough, the threat is not
so urgent as to be a matter of a
few months. The more immedia
ately urgent consideration is, no
doubt, the need to stabilize the
East German regime, particularly
in view of the flow of refugees.
My general impression was that
he was firmly resolved, perhaps
irretrievably committed, to a
showdown on the German ques
tion. But it was evident also that
he dreaded the tension—he re
ferred to this several times —and
is still looking for a negotiation
which will work out a postpone
ment and an accommodation.
In the talks it transpired that
he is thinking of the problem as
having three phases.
THE FIRST is what he con
siders the real and also the event
ual solution. He has no hope, how
ever, that the West will now ac
cept it. His thesis is as follows.
The two Germanys cannot be re
united. The West will not agree to
a unified Communist Germany
and the Soviet Union will not
agree to the absorption and de
struction of the GDR by West

Germany. There are in fact two
Germanys. The way to proceed is,
then, to “codify” the status quo in
the form of peace treaties with
what he called the three elements
of Germany. These three elements
are West Germany, East Ger
many, and West Berlin.

This codification would require
de facto but not diplomatic recog
nition of the GDR. It would fix by
international statute the position
of West Berlin as “a free city,”
with its right of access and its in
ternal liberty guaranteed by the
presence of “symbolic contin
gents” of French, British, Ameri
can, and Russian troops, by neu
tral troops under the aegis of the
U.N., and by the signatures of the
two Germanys and the four oc
cupying powers.
As I said above, Mr. Khru
shchev does not expect at this
time to reach this solution. He
has, therefore, a second position
which he called a “fallback" posi
tion. This is essentially that of
the Soviets at the last Geneva con
ference of the foreign ministers.
It would call for a temporary
agreement. In the Russian view
but not in our view this tempor
ary agreement would have a short
and fixed time limit of perhaps
two to three years. During this
time the two German states would
be invited to negotiate on a form
of unification perhaps, though
he did not say so specifically in
this talk, a kind of loose confeder
ation. At the end of the fixed
period of time, if a new agree
ment about West; Berlin along the
lines I have outlined previously
was reached, it would be emobdied
in a treaty. If no agreement was
reached, the legal rights of oc
cupation would lapse.
THIS GERMAN solution was,
as we know, refused by the West.
But if there is to be another
round of negotiations, variants on
it are likely to be the substance of
the bargaining.
If this fails, Mr. Khrushchev’s
third position is that ho will sign
a separate peace treaty with East
Germany. Then the GDR will in
the Soviet view be sovereign over
the lights of access to West Ber
lin. If the Western powers refuse
to do business with the GDR and
use force to enter West Berlin,
then the Soviet government will
use the Red Army to blockade
West Berlin.
Though it would be foolish to
undervalue his determination, the
threat is not quite so fierce as it
sounds. For he most certainly
does not want a military show
down, and “doing business” with
the GDR is a flexible and not a
rigid conception.
I HAVE confined myself strictly
to reporting my understanding of
the Soviet policy on Germany. If
I may venture an opinion of my
own, I would make these points.
First, Mr. Khrushchev will not
precipitate a crisis until he has
had a chance to talk face to face
with President Kennedy.
Second, he will surely sign a
separate peace treaty if he cannot
negotiate a temporary accommo
dation which is described under
his "second position.”
Third, the crucial points which

will determine whether the Ger
man question is resolved by ne
gotiation or goes to a showdown
are whether the prospect of nu
clear arms for Germany increases
or diminishes, and whether or not
we say that the freedom of West
Berlin, to which we are pledged,
can be maintained only by a re
fusal to negotiate about this fu
ture.

1 HAVE been asked many times
since we left the Soviet Union to
come to London whether I found
the whole interview encouraging
or depressing. I found it sobering.
On the one hand, the evidence was
convincing that the USSR is not
contemplating war and is genuine
ly concerned to prevent any crisis,
be it in Laos, in Cuba, or in Ger
many, from being uncontrollable.
On the other hand, there is no
doubt that the Soviet government
has a relentless determination to
foster the revolutionary move
ment in the underdeveloped coun
tries. This relentless determina
tion springs from an unqualified
faith in the pre-destined accept
ance of Communism by the under
developed countries. The Soviet
government has great confidence
in its own military forces. But it
regards them not as an instru
ment of world conquest but as the
guardian against American inter
ference with the predestined
world revolution.
