# A SPORTING PROPOSITION

When Payton Jordan puts on a track meet he does it up right. He
is one of a handful of track experts around today who, in addition
to being a trainer of strong bodies, is a great showman.
Take last Saturday for example. Two of the great track powers
in the country—USC and Oregon- came in for a dramatic head-to
head clash, with Stanford along to add some spice. All sorts of world
and national records were possibilities, hut Lady Luck would not
shine on Stanford Stadium as the rains came all night preceding
the meet.
THERE WAS JORDAN, up at R o’clock, seeing what had to be
done to gel the soggy cinder oval back into workable shape for the
afternoon’s festivities. (
The surface was worked on and by 1 ;30 the meet was ready to
begin on schedule. To those who know Jordan there was never any

doubt, but that the day would still
be an exciting one.
The swashbuckling mentor
came to Stanford four years ago
with a distinguished record as a
coach and competitor. He has
since proven why he is recognized
all over the world as one of the
outstanding authorities, teachers,
and coaches in his field. His color
ful personality reflects itself in
the way his recent teams--not un
usually strong have matured and
succeeded.
LAST YEAR, for instance, the
Cards finished in a tie for sixth
in the National Collegiate Cham
pionships and were also selected
sixth among the dual track and
field teams in the country. Inter
estingly enough, the Indians W'on
the latter spot the hard way. They
were the only team to meet all
five chosen ahead of them in dual
competition.

This season it Is the same story all over again, as the spikers
face probably the toughest schedule in the land. Matching strides
with such squads as USC. Oregon, Occidental, San Jose State, UCLA
and Oklahoma shows that Jordan thinks he can meet the best year
after year—with good material or poor—and still come out on top.
This is his own personal quality—the intangible that there is more
to being a track coach than just having a winning season.
Nothing Like a Track Meet'
Jordan loves track dearly and says, “For me, there is nothing like
the thrills that can be gotten at a track meet. Take a football game.
There is only one central battle. In a track meet there are so many
things happening all around you. There are no thrills like athletes
putting out more than they ever thought they could do. I'll always
love track the best.”
Jordan’s ability to ‘run’ an interesting meet stems directly from
this intense love. The handsome, well-built (6-1 '•*, 185-poundt gentle
man will always be remembered for his professional-type handling
of last summer’s Olympic Trials. The trials were a great crowd
pleaser and the two-day extravaganza was acclaimed by many ex
perts as the greatest meet of its kind ever held. All attendance and
gate receipt records for previous trials were soundly beaten.
A WONDERFUL performer himself in his college days when he
was captain of the USC team. Jordan is a man whose enthusiasm
and friendly warmth are available to all. He is never too busy to
talk about track. This reporter'saw him take the time to talk to three
young girls after the San Jose State-Oklahoma meet earlier this
spring, and the only thing that tore him away was the desire to
talk to his team before anyone had a chance to dress and leave. Other
wise, he might have talked to the girls all afternoon.
