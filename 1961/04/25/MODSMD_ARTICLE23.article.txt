### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford breezed to a 5-2 tri
umph over California yesterday
at Sunken Diamond. The win was
the Indians’ first in league compe
tition against five losses, while
the Bears plunged from first to
third in the tight CIBA race, with
a 3-2 mark.
Today at 3:15 Stanford faces
USF on the home field for the
second time this year. In the two
teams’ first meeting. Stanford
prevailed 7-0.
STANFORD jumped on Cal’s
starting pitcher Bill Oakley for
three runs in the second inning.
Oakley walked Mike Magee to
open the inning, and the second
sacker scored on Joel Shulman’s
long double over Cal left-fielder
Kevin Scarpelli’s head. Stanford
starting pitcher Mark Miller
bunted Shulman to third. After
Hal Schutzmann drew a walk,
Lee Moench drove in Shulman
with a single.
Skip Lawrence singled to load
the bases, but the side was re
tired with one more run when
John Hurlbut flied out to center
field and Moench was thrown out
at third while Schutzmann scored.
Cal scored in the third and
came within a run of Stanford in
the fifth inning, but Jim Smith
came in and retired the side after
giving up a run-scoring single.
SMITH WENT the last 4% in
nings, giving up only two hits
and no tallies. He walked only
one batter and struck out three.
Miller got credit for the victory.
He pitched 4 1 . t innings, allowing
four hits and Cal’s two runs.
Stanford clinched the win with
runs in the fifth and sixth innings.
In the fifth. Bob Overman singled
to deep shortstop, stole second
base, went to third on Magee’s
single, and scored when Cal
catcher Bob Milano dropped a
perfect throw to home plate in
a rundown.
The run in the sixth inning
came on a California error, a sac
rifice bunt, and Skip Lawrence’s
double to left field that, raised
dust as it landed on the foul line.
