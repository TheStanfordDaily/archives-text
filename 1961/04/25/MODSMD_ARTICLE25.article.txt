## 
### United Press International 
Frank Lary, the American
League’s most successful “Yankee
killer,’’ mowed down the New
Yorkers for the 24th time in his
career yesterday, 4-3, on a seven
hitter and pitched the Detroit
Tigers to their eighth straight
victory.
The league-leading Tigers, who
have not lost since their season
opener 13 days ago, broke a 2-2
tie with single runs in the fourth
and fifth innings and then with
stood a Yankee threat in the
seventh to cinch the victory. Bob
Turley was the losing pitcher.
The wanning streak represents
the longest the Tigers have
strung together since 1949 when
they won 10 in a row’.
Lary, posting his third victory
against no defeats, proved his
mettle in the seventh inning when
the Yanks threatened to pull it
out.
