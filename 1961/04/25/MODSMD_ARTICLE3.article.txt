## 
### 
PARIS (UPIi—A general loyal
to President Charles do Gaulle
was named head of the Air Force
in Algeria today and immediately
ordered his men to refuse to obey
or help the insurgents.
Gen. Michel Fourquet, the first
high officer in Algeria to de
nounce the insurrection, had been
commander of the Tactical Air
Corps in the Constantine area.
He was put in command of all
air forces in Algeria as de Gaulle
put an economic blockade on the
North African territory and mo
bilized Army reservists and ci
vilian militia at home.
THE GOVERNMENT, moan
while, claimed that the bulk of
the 400,000 troops in Algeria re
mained loyal. It based the claim
on a report from 10 pilots who
escaped the insurgents and re
turned to France.
The pilots also reported more
than 1,000 Air Force personnel
demonstrated at Algiers Airport
against the insurgents.
But the insurgents vowed in Al
giers to “fight on to final victory.”
Appealing for wider support for
their revolt, insurgent Army
forces in the western Algerian
city of Oran claimed they had dis
covered a French order for a
cease fire against Algerian Mos
lem I'ebels. The alleged order was
dated March 29.
THERE WAS no immediate
comment Rom the de Gaulle gov
ernment which brought out more
tanks and armored cars in Paris
and ordered the Air Force to
shoot down “on sight” any planes
from Algeria.
Thousands of civilians volun
teered to fight.
The North African territory
was totally isolated from France
by a financial and shipping stop
page.
France still feared invasion by
the generals and their Foreign Le
gion paratroops. Parisian air
ports, opened during the day,
were closed for the second night
last night and barricaded to pre
vent landings.
