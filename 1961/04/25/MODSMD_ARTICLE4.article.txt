### 
BY FRANCES FISHER
Presidential candidate Bob Say
ler finally has an opponent! The
returns from Floi’ence, which
came in by air mail letter yester
day, decided the runoff for the
ASSU pxesidential nomination in
favor of Lawrie Chickering.
Although contender Jim McGee
picked up two votes, while Chick
ering received none from the Flor
ence voters, Chickering had a
27-vote lead, putting him on the
final ballot.
ASSU Pi'esident Larry Royse,
who talked on the phone to Mike
Connoi-s, pi'esident of the Flor
ence campus, stated that because
of the expense of sending the re
sults by telegi'am, the group had
decided on an air mail letter,
which they mailed last Wednes
day. The campus had foi’gotten
about night letters, Royse men

tioned. To avoid similar delays
in the final election set for to
morrow, a night letter will bo
used for the results.
Sayler held a powerful load
in the Florence count, Royse said,

but the exact totals were not avail
able when he talked to Connors.
VOTING in the finals will be
gin tomoiTow when the polls at
Engineex-ing Corner and the Post
Office open at 8:45. The polls at
the Physics Lecture Hall will be
open from 9 to 1, those at the
Law Libi’ary from 10 to 1 and
those at Main Libraxy tomoiTow
night from 7-9.
Because of lack of equipment,
supei’visex’s and pexsonnel, and
"because of the politicking that
is going on” there will be no polls
at Encina, Toyon, Stern and the
Row, said Elna Rodenhouso, Elec
tions Committee chairman.

Stanford radio station KZSU,
880 on tile dial, will broadcast a

Presidential candidate Bob Say
ler finally has an opponent! The
returns from Floi’ence, which
came in by air mail letter yester
day, decided the runoff for the
ASSU pxesidential nomination in
favor of Lawrie Chickering.
Although contender Jim McGee
picked up two votes, while Chick
ering received none from the Flor
ence voters, Chickering had a
27-vote lead, putting him on the
final ballot.
ASSU Pi'esident Larry Royse,
who talked on the phone to Mike
Connoi-s, pi'esident of the Flor
ence campus, stated that because
of the expense of sending the re
sults by telegi'am, the group had
decided on an air mail letter,
which they mailed last Wednes
day. The campus had foi’gotten
about night letters, Royse men

tioned. To avoid similar delays
in the final election set for to
morrow, a night letter will bo
used for the results.
