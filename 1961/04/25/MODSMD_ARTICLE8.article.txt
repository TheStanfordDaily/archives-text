I public a set of resolutions laying down rules con
{ eerning posters and other “visual art media” used
I by student groups to publicize activities on campus.
The main resolution declaims “Theft or unau

mental Standard violation whether . . . the object
removed has actual monetary value.”
It added “Art Board will initiate formal action
against any persons who are proven to have re
moved. disturbed, or in any way mutilated visual
communications devices . . .”
IT NOTED THAT “collection of visual devices
after the date of a particular activity which they
announce, is permitted when the sponsoring group
has no further need for these devices. In any case
... the permission of the student group should
be obtained before removing posters, etc., for per
sonal possession.”
Another resolution from the group, which was
set up last quarter to provide a “Graphic Art Fac-
I ulty” which provides student groups with a depend
i able, capable poster and “visual communications”
service, declared that the board will fine groups 2.3
| cents per poster if their posters are not down
within three days after the activity they publicize
1 is finished.
The 23-cent “per item” charge will go into a
special account, 80 per cent of which will be
j donated to the annual Con Home drive. The other
1 20 per cent will go to the hoard’s Activities Division
* “for use in stimulating the efforts of Art Board

members towards positive enforcement of” the
resolution.
THK BO Alt I) SAID “All posters and similar
visual media on public displays are the property of
student organizations utilizing them, regardless
of their initial source.”
In a third measure, the board said “To protect
the original design and intent of the artist who

and promotional needs of various student groups
on campus, Ait Board gives its full support to the
artist’s original concept, in instances of contro
versy after the use of a design lias been accepted
by a requesting student” group.
“In the case of student organizations attempt
ing to alter the artist's design as submitted for a
poster, display, etc., (he group must yield its de
mands to the designer’s original intent if the de
signer has already obtained the group’s assent
that his design is presented in terms of the pur
pose for which it is needed.”
IT ADDKI) "In turn, . . . Art Board expects
that artists and designers will consult with leaders
of student organizations to understand their needs,
