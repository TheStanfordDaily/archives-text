# Stanford Receives Vanderbilt Yacht For Ocean Studies
## Pioneer Will Be Converted Into Marine Research Lab 
### AUSTIN SCOTT 
The acquisition of a 172-foot steel-hulled sailing ship and over
$460,000 will soon enable Stanford to make its first excursion into
open-ocean biological research.
The National Science Foundation today awarded Stanford $462,-
945 to be used in converting the two-masted schooner "Pioneer"

into the world’s largest scientific
sailing ship.
THE Pioneer, currently the sec
ond largest sailing ship under
U.S. registry, was given to Stan
ford’s Hopkins Marine Station at
Pacific Grove by philanthropist
George Vanderbilt, and the Na
tional Science Foundation’s gift
will turn her into a floating class
room of the sea.
“The ship’s mission of training
young scientists will he a totally
new one for such vessels,” said
Stanford President Wallace Ster
ling.

“Her primary purpose will be
to assist those on board to learn
more about the sea around them,
to pursue freely the most promis
ing or provocative discoveries
without hinderances from pre-ar
ranged research programs.”
THE Pioneer, staffed by three
faculty and twelve graduate stu
dents from installations through
out the United States, will be used
on a year-round schedule of re
search and graduate training.
Each working year will be di
vided into four terms of ten weeks
each, with most of each term
spent at sea.
At the beginning of each term
the pioneer will survey a section
of ocean. Biological specimens
will be collected at all depths and
physical and chemical characteris
tics of the water will be investi
gated. Data from these excur
sions will be turned over to any
qualified scientist for study.
DAILY lectures will supplement
field and laboratory work and
each student will submit a final
report on his activities during the
term.
Although the Pioneer has been
used before to gather marine
specimens, this will be her first
assignment as a research ship.
Most of her time will be spent in
the northeastern Pacific, although
scientists contemplate studying
poorly known portions of the
world’s oceans.
The Pioneer's history begins in
1927 when she was built at a cost
of $1.4 million and named the
Cressida. She participated in nu
merous yacht races until acquired
and renamed in 1938 by Vander
bilt. She collected museum speci
mens until World War 11, when
she was used as a training ship
by the Navy. Since 1951 she has
been afloat at Newport Beach.
DR. ROLF L. Bolin, assistant
director of Hopkins Marine Sta
tion and professor of biology at
Stanford will take charge of con
verting the Pioneer to research
work and selecting the faculty
and students.
Bolin plans to add dry and wot
laboratories, trawling frames and
winches, radio, radar and sonar
gear, and other hydrographic in
struments to make the Pioneer a
completely equipped biological
laboratory. She should be ready
for her shakedown cruise six
months after conversion starts.
Bolin will direct the Pioneer’s
entire scientific progi’am. He said
the number of oceanographic
problems open to attack from
such a ship are limited only by
(ho imagination and ingenuity of
the scientific staff.
MOST research vessels are de
voted to oceanography, but the
Pioneer wall concentrate prima
rily on marine biology. Hopkins
Marine Station, owned and oper
ated by Stanford, was established
in 1892 and has retained an em
phasis on marine biology, rather
than physical and chemical ocean
ography. It is the oldest such in
stitution on the Pacific Coast.
Sterling said acquisition of the
Pioneer places the Station “in a
position to expand both signifi
cantly both its work and its lead
ing reputation.”
