“I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY END
TO THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUSINESS’’
When Gene Segin got his B.S. in Business Ad
ministration at the University of Illinois, he was
in touch with 8 prospective employers.
Gene joined Illinois Bell Telephone Company
because; “The people I talked to here made it
very clear that 1 would not be shuffled into some
narrow specialized job. I thought this job offered
the greatest opportunity for broad experience.”
On his first assignment Gene was sent to Spring
field where he conducted courses in human rela
tions for management people.
His next move was to a traffic operations job
in Rock Island. On this assignment he was in
charge of all personnel who are directly responsible
for handling telephone calls in this heavily popu
lated area. Here Gene earned a reputation for
sound judgment and skill in working with people.
He was promoted to Traffic Supervisor.
Today, Gene’s chief responsibilities are in man
agement training and development, and company
union relations. The latter includes contract bar
gaining and helping settle labor disputes.
How does Gene feel about his job? “It’s a real
challenge. I’m in some of the most vital and in
teresting work in the country.” And about the
future—“ Well there aren’t any pushover jobs
around here. It’s tough. But if a man has what it
takes, I don’t think there’s any end to the oppor
tunity in this business.”
