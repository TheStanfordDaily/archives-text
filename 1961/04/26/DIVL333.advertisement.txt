Even though modern electronic computers work at al
most unbelievable speeds, the scientist is way ahead
of them.
Put quite simply, scientists have been thinking up com
plex problems faster than even the fastest computers
could handle them. To close this gap, IBM created
STRETCH, the world’s fastest, most powerful computer.
The first STRETCH system will go to the AEC at Los
Alamos to aid in nuclear reactor design. This goliath can
do a million additions or subtractions a second. It can
“read" the equivalent of four million characters per
minute from magnetic tape. It can print the equivalent
of three good-sized novels every hour. It can perform
all these operations simultaneously, and if necessary
pause midway in the problem and tackle a more im:
poriant one.
Creating such tools and putting them to work for sci-’’
ence—or for business, industry, or government is ex
citing, important work. It calls for talents and skills of
every kind, from liberal arts to Boolean algebra to astro
physics.
So whatever your particular talents and skills, there
may be just the kind of job at IBM you've always wanted.
The IBM representative will be visiting your campus this
year. Why not ask him about it? Your placement office
can make an appointment. For further information about
