# Algerian Leaders Flee; Revolt Folds
## 
### 
ALGIERS (UPl)—The four-day generals' revolt against President
Charles de Gaulle collapsed last night as suddenly as it began.
Government troops barred from Algiers by mutinous paratroopers
for four days took over the city almost without a fight.
General Maurice Challe, 56, the leader of the four dissidents, Gen.

Raoul Salan, 61, and air force Gen.
Edmond Jouhaud, 55, drove off in
a truck with a group of Legion
naires to an unknown destination
and an unknown fate.
THE FOURTH general, Andre-
Marie Zeller, 63, was last seen
leaving the square in civilian
clothes and on foot.
De Gaulle, who fought back
against the revolt with iron deter
mination, conferred in Paris with
his ministers on how to handle the
aftermath of a revolution that
nearly became a civil war.
The revolt collapsed within the
space of half an hour after a day
filled with rumors and reports the
insurrectionists wore planning to
invade Paris itself.
MOST OF the Foreign Legion
paratroopers who had occupied
the center of Algiers since early
Saturday withdrew to the sub
urbs. A handful remained in the
Forum, Algiers’ main downtown
square.
Sailors loyal to De Gaulle took
over the Algiers radio station
which changed hands in a drama
packed half hour shortly before
midnight, Algiers time.
By 1:30 a.m. it was all over
four days almost to the minute
since the revolt broke last Satur
day in protest against De Gaulle’s
determination to grant independ
ence to the Moslem Arabs here.
FIGHTING broke out in the
streets as the paratroopers pulled
out, their trucks rumbling
through avenues electric with
tension. ,
It was believed that most of
those involved were civilians. But
some paratroopers who remained
behind appeared to be clashing
with police.
Algiers radio, once more under
control of the government, broad
cast appeals for calm.
"IT IS ALL OVER,” it said.
“Go home. The situation is nor
mal.”

The announcer’s voice was filled
with emotion but his appeals fell
oil deaf ears. Thousands thronged
the streets to watch government
troops take over key buildings.

Sailors loyal to De Gaulle took
over the Algiers radio station
which changed hands in a drama
packed half hour shortly before
midnight, Algiers time.
By 1:30 a.m. it was all over
four days almost to the minute
since the revolt broke last Satur
day in protest against De Gaulle’s
determination to grant independ
ence to the Moslem Arabs here.
FIGHTING broke out in the
streets as the paratroopers pulled
out, their trucks rumbling
through avenues electric with
tension. ,
It was believed that most of
those involved were civilians. But
some paratroopers who remained
behind appeared to be clashing
with police.
Algiers radio, once more under
control of the government, broad
cast appeals for calm.
"IT IS ALL OVER,” it said.
“Go home. The situation is nor
mal.”

The announcer’s voice was filled
with emotion but his appeals fell
oil deaf ears. Thousands thronged
the streets to watch government
troops take over key buildings.
ALGIERS (UPl)—The four-day generals' revolt against President
Charles de Gaulle collapsed last night as suddenly as it began.
Government troops barred from Algiers by mutinous paratroopers
for four days took over the city almost without a fight.
General Maurice Challe, 56, the leader of the four dissidents, Gen.

Raoul Salan, 61, and air force Gen.
Edmond Jouhaud, 55, drove off in
a truck with a group of Legion
naires to an unknown destination
and an unknown fate.
THE FOURTH general, Andre-
Marie Zeller, 63, was last seen
leaving the square in civilian
clothes and on foot.
De Gaulle, who fought back
against the revolt with iron deter
mination, conferred in Paris with
his ministers on how to handle the
aftermath of a revolution that
nearly became a civil war.
The revolt collapsed within the
space of half an hour after a day
filled with rumors and reports the
insurrectionists wore planning to
invade Paris itself.
MOST OF the Foreign Legion
paratroopers who had occupied
the center of Algiers since early
Saturday withdrew to the sub
urbs. A handful remained in the
Forum, Algiers’ main downtown
square.
