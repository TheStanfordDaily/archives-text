For ASSU president, the long-awaited Florence ballot, which

arrived Monday, put Lawrio
Chickering on the ballot opposite
candidate Bob Saylor.
OTHER CANDIDATES appear

ward and Bill Broil for the re
maining position as Men’s Row
representative to Legislature, Wil
liam Callison and Bob Oaks for
Stern representative, Sandy

Pofahl and Dave Williams for
Class of 1963 president, and Linda
Gogins and Pat Christensen for
AWS president. Miss Christensen,
however, has stated that she is
not a candidate for this office.
In a debate on KZSU last night,
presidential candidates dicker
ing and Sayler narrowed the dif
ferences in their platforms slight
ly. The candidates were ques
tioned by Bill Brink. KZSU news
director, Ed Cutter, administra
tive assistant to the ASSU presi
dent; Scotty Thompson, Political

Union head; Maynard Parker,
Daily editor; and Frances Fisher,
Daily assistant managing editor.
In discussing the controversial
subject of the president’s position
as chairman of Legislature, Say
ler said that ho would feel per
fectly free to turn any meeting
over to an assistant if he felt he
needed to speak as a non-presid
ing officer.
SAYLER POINTED out that a
change in the constitution would
only shackle the president by re
stricting him from the power to
preside over the meeting.
Chickering reiterated his stand
that the president must be taken
off Legislature in order to re
move the obstacle that has been
hindering student government for
the "past 20 to 30 years.”
Both candidates stated that, in
the final analysis, their programs
rested on the enthusiasm they
could rouse from the student
body. In response to the question
“Do the candidates feel that Leg
islature has sufficiently qualified
leaders to carry out the candi
dates’ proposal?” both candidates
replied that the potential ap
peared good.
ANSWERING moderator Bill
Brink’s final question, "Why do
you think you are the man to put
through the programs you pro
pose?” Chickering said that “A
look at the platforms shows that
my platform better faces the prob
lems of the Stanford student
body.” Sayler stated that his spe
cific ideas for improvement, his
extensive past experience and his
reasonable platform made him
the man for the job.
In addition to Engineering Cor
ner and the post office, polls will
be located at Physics Lecture Hall
from 9 to 1, the Law' Library

only shackle the president by re
stricting him from the power to
preside over the meeting.
Chickering reiterated his stand
that the president must be taken
off Legislature in order to re
move the obstacle that has been
hindering student government for
the "past 20 to 30 years.”
Both candidates stated that, in
the final analysis, their programs
rested on the enthusiasm they
could rouse from the student
body. In response to the question
“Do the candidates feel that Leg
islature has sufficiently qualified
leaders to carry out the candi
dates’ proposal?” both candidates
replied that the potential ap
peared good.

Brink’s final question, "Why do
you think you are the man to put
through the programs you pro
pose?” Chickering said that “A
look at the platforms shows that

extensive past experience and his
reasonable platform made him
the man for the job.
