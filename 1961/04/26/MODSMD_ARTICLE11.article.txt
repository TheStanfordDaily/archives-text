BERMAN PREPS FOR PROM

Here's sophisticated, incisive comedian Shelley Berman
who'll appear at the annual all-class Junior Prom Friday
night at Bay Meadows. Ticket sales at Engineering Corner
will positively close on Thursday, said junior president Jim
Shekoyan. Cost per couple is $5.50 with a class card, $5.95
without. Ray Hackettâ€™s orchestra will play for dancing from
9 until 1, and dress is dark suit and cocktail dress.
