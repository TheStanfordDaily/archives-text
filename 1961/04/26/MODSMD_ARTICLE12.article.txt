# Creativity Tests Described by Psychologist

### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
“Thinking and Creativity" was
the topic last night of Donald W.
Taylor, Yale psychologist, at the
Tuesday Evening Series. The for
mer Stanford professor is well
known for research on problem
solving, decision-making, and cre
ative thinking.
Taylor discussed the convictions
employers often have in predict
ing creativity and problem solv
ing ability of potential employees.
EMPLOYERS often attach im
portance to whether or not the po
tential employee has hobbies, ho
said in illustration. However, tests
have shown no definite relation.
Studies made on the con-elation
of IQ with creativity found small
relation, he said, but since the
tests were made on groups of
people with high IQs, the results
were not meaningful.

Another aiea of testing was the
realtionship of the employee’s
undergraduate grades with his
creativity 10 or 12 years later.
Some employers think there will
be a difference in creativity be
tween. for instance, the A and the
B student, but no large correla
tion was found.
ONE AREA that did show a
definite correlation with creativi
ty, ho continued, was the em
ployee’s choice of favorite sub
jects in school. Out of the tested
group of engineers, creative per
sons tended to favor classroom, or
theoretical, scientific work, while
the less creative preferred the sci
entific labs.
He also illustrated the differ
ence in effectiveness of group
thinking and individual-thinking
toward creativity and problem
solving. In the test some partici
pants worked in groups, and oth
ers worked individually, to solve
a problem. The group procedure,
called “brainstorming” has four
rules for the participants: (1) do
not criticize ideas, (2) produce as
many ideas as possible, (31 let
yourself go, and (4) improve on
others ideas.
