# New Health Center In PACE Program
## 
### 
We are gratified to see that plans for a new $750,000 student
infirmary were included in last week's announcement of the $lOO
million PACE campaign. The facility, when built, would replace
the present crowded offices and treatment rooms of the Health
Service along with abolishing the rather rickety rest homes and
Isolation Hospital. It would also provide space for minor surgical
operations now done at the Palo Alto Clinic.

After many years of pushing the project to the bottom of the
priority list the University is finally moving ahead with these plans.
We urge them to keep moving. The proposals for a new health
center are now before an ad hoc committee of the faculty. Dean
of Students H. Donald Winbigler, a member of the committee, has
estimated that at least six months will be needed before the com
mittee issues its final report. Certainly it would be imprudent to
make hasty decisions on a matter where so much is at stake both
in student welfare and in money. However, the committee in pacing
its workload should remember Health Service Director Dr. George
Houck's rather startling disclosures of last quarter that his doctors
have had to treat serious illness such as pneumonia in the dormi
tories or the rest homes; that the present Health Center was built
to serve 500 women students; and that the Isolation Hospital is a
firetrap as well as being insufficient to handle a major epidemic
on campus.

Mr. Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice president for finance, has stated
that "If a donor were to come forth with the money, Stanford could
have a new infirmary within two and a half years." Such a donor
should be met with some sort of specUic word-picture of the new
facility. The ad hoc committee should provide this pictureâ€”as soon
as feasibly possible.
