## Latin American Policy Needs Major Revamping 
### 
The Cuban crisis indeed calls
for a re-evaluation of American
foreign policy toward Latin Amer
ica. Ail sides seem agreed to its
failure, and yet no sure replace
ment can be seen.

There seems to be a genuine
confusion as to the cause and so
lution for the recent Cuban de
bacle. It has been pointed out that
Castro has consistently followed
an anti-American policy.
WHEN CASTHO came to the
United States in April 1959, short
ly after the revolution, he was
greeted wildly by New York
crodws. Upon reaching Washing
ton, however, he was officially
snubbed. Neither the President,
nor the Vice President, nor the
Secretary of State would meet
with him.

His only meeting was wilh
lower State Department officials
who urged him to move slowly in
his reforms and to avoid jeopard
izing American interests. The
American government showed lit
tle interest in helping the newly
established Cuban regime and
turned down his requests for
modest assistance.

American press and officials
have for some time labelled Cas
tro a paranoid who sees danger
lurking around every corner.
These charges were in answer to
Castro’s claims that the U.S. gov
ernment was giving arms and as
sistance to Cuban exiles. Our gov
ernment denied these reports.
SEVERAL months ago, how
ever, the reports began to come
through of exile training bases in
Florida and Louisiana, and even
earlier, a report, almost hidden
by the American press and denied
by all governments involved, that
exile bases were established in
Guatemala, was released by Dr.
Ronald Hilton of Hispanic-Ameri
can Studies.

The prelude to the invasion was
the bombing of Havana by U.S.-
built, World War II B-26’s, flown
by Cubans who claimed to be de
fectors from Castro’s Air Force.
Adlai Stevenson in the UN. ri
diculed Cuban Foreign Minister
Roa’s claim that these planes
came from U.S. bases.
Following the defeat of the in-

I vasion, it was learned that these
pilots were flying from a U.S.-
built and equipped base in Guata
mala.
THE INVASION itself would
have been a comedy of errors, had
it not been so serious. Shortly be
j fore the attack, President Ken-
I nedy said the U.S. would never
i directly intervene. Immediately
: after the invasion’s failure. Ken-
I nedy said the U.S. might inter
j vene, alone if need be, to protect
j our security in this hemisphere.
| Clearly U.S.-Cuban relations
! have reached a serious impasse.
| It is no longer possible to talk of
| what the United States should
j have done. Our present policy
| must now be considered.
Despite our talk of national se
curity and Communist infiltration
I in Latin America, a policy of U.S.
j intervention and invasion would
seem disastrous.
AN INVASION of Cuba would
I no more erase our mistakes of the
j past two years than violence cor
| rected the errors of Russia in
| Hungary or of England and
J France in Egypt.
Rather, now that the blunders
have been brought directly to the
attention of the nation, we should
endeavor to change U.S. policy to
ward Latin America. Although
I proposals have often been made
to reorient our outlook toward
this important segment of the
world, they have been largely ig
nored.
We can no longer afford the
luxury of apathy toward South
America. If we are to retain a po
sition of leadership in this area, it
will not be by pious mouthing of
the Monroe Doctrine.
AN INVASION of Cuba might
succeed, taut we could well lose
South America as an aftermath
of the intervention. We must rec
ognize our failure in Cuba and act
to correct those policies which lost
this long-time friend.
President Kennedy’s economic
plan for Latin America has many
positive points designed to raise
the living standards in the area.
However, we must present our
selves to these countries as a su
perior alternative to Russian im
perialism if we deserve or expect
their support and friendship.

greeted wildly by New York
crodws. Upon reaching Washing
ton, however, he was officially
snubbed. Neither the President,
nor the Vice President, nor the
Secretary of State would meet
with him.

His only meeting was wilh
lower State Department officials
who urged him to move slowly in
his reforms and to avoid jeopard
izing American interests. The
American government showed lit
tle interest in helping the newly
established Cuban regime and
turned down his requests for
modest assistance.

American press and officials
have for some time labelled Cas
tro a paranoid who sees danger
lurking around every corner.
These charges were in answer to
Castro’s claims that the U.S. gov
ernment was giving arms and as
sistance to Cuban exiles. Our gov
ernment denied these reports.
SEVERAL months ago, how
ever, the reports began to come
through of exile training bases in
Florida and Louisiana, and even
earlier, a report, almost hidden
by the American press and denied
by all governments involved, that
exile bases were established in
Guatemala, was released by Dr.
Ronald Hilton of Hispanic-Ameri
can Studies.

The prelude to the invasion was
the bombing of Havana by U.S.-
built, World War II B-26’s, flown
by Cubans who claimed to be de
fectors from Castro’s Air Force.
Adlai Stevenson in the UN. ri
diculed Cuban Foreign Minister
Roa’s claim that these planes
came from U.S. bases.
Following the defeat of the in-

I vasion, it was learned that these
pilots were flying from a U.S.-
built and equipped base in Guata
mala.
THE INVASION itself would
have been a comedy of errors, had
it not been so serious. Shortly be
j fore the attack, President Ken-
I nedy said the U.S. would never
i directly intervene. Immediately
: after the invasion’s failure. Ken-
I nedy said the U.S. might inter
j vene, alone if need be, to protect
j our security in this hemisphere.
| Clearly U.S.-Cuban relations
! have reached a serious impasse.
| It is no longer possible to talk of
| what the United States should
j have done. Our present policy
| must now be considered.
Despite our talk of national se
curity and Communist infiltration
I in Latin America, a policy of U.S.
j intervention and invasion would
seem disastrous.
AN INVASION of Cuba would
I no more erase our mistakes of the
j past two years than violence cor
| rected the errors of Russia in
| Hungary or of England and
J France in Egypt.
Rather, now that the blunders
have been brought directly to the
attention of the nation, we should
endeavor to change U.S. policy to
ward Latin America. Although
I proposals have often been made
to reorient our outlook toward
this important segment of the
world, they have been largely ig
nored.
We can no longer afford the
luxury of apathy toward South
America. If we are to retain a po
sition of leadership in this area, it
will not be by pious mouthing of
the Monroe Doctrine.
AN INVASION of Cuba might
succeed, taut we could well lose
South America as an aftermath
of the intervention. We must rec
ognize our failure in Cuba and act
to correct those policies which lost
this long-time friend.
President Kennedy’s economic
plan for Latin America has many
positive points designed to raise
the living standards in the area.
However, we must present our
selves to these countries as a su
perior alternative to Russian im
perialism if we deserve or expect
their support and friendship.
