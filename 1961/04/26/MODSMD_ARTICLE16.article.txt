An Endorsement

The question of the proper role
of the ASSU President in the leg
islative process is receiving undue
emphasis. I submit that the ques
tion is largely one of legislative
technique—that if Lawrie Chick
ering feels as did I that he ran be
most effective with it—fine. But
if Bob Sayler feels that he can do
more as the immediate chairman
—that too is an acceptable ap
proach. In any event, the most im
portant criteria are those that are
being largely overlooked:
1. What experience, what pre
vious indication of interest and
competence, does the candidate
offer?
2. What, has the aspirant of
fered in terms of direct, specific
solutions for the two most im
mediate present weaknesses of
the ASSU - administration and
communication?
3. How does the candidate en
vision the role of student govern
ment?
Despite the fact that my legis
lative approach differs from Bob
Sayler’s. I feel that he meets these
criteria most, fully, and it is on
this basis that I extend my en
dorsement to him.

In yesterday’s Daily Mr. Chick
ering repeated his tiresome case
for taking the gavel away from
the President at LASSU meetings.
On the eve of the election I would
like to present my stand on this
issue again and examine my op
ponent’s position for the last time.
Lawrie and I agree that the ex
ecutive branch should have a
chance to make its wishes known
to the legislators. There are three
ways this has always been done
in LASSU: 1) through the admin
istrative assistant to the presi
dent, 2) nearly always through a
legislator partial to the executive
view (as it is done in the national
government), 3) through the
ASSU President when he chooses
to relinquish the chair. The ques
tion has never been whether or
not the executive can air his opin
ions but rather which of these
three means he should use. All
Lawrie is suggesting in this re
gard is that the president, by con
stitutional amendment, be banned
from the LASSU chair, so that
he can speak when he wants to.
Yet, he can speak when he wants
ton now. This is not a new altern
ative for presenting presidential
views. Chickering would simply

deny the president one of his im
portant responsibilities with no
new advantages added to the sys
tem. There is no need to intro
duce useless rigidity into an or
ganization that should remain as
flexible and adaptable as possible
to meet the shifting needs of the
University and the annual turn- 1
over in student personnel.
Besides presenting no new ad-1
vantages, Chickering’s proposal |
does involve some very real disad- :
vantages. The president suffers |
from acute underexposure to the
student body as it is; Lawrie’s
plan would only aggravate this
situation. Further, I don’t like to |
picture the president in the role!
of a “lobbyist” (my opponent’s j
term); this would only subtract ;
more of the respect that Lawrle 1
claims is so deficient in the office
now. Finally, the job of running !
the legislature is one of the presi- j
dent’s important functions.}
LASSU has been slow, logy, in-1
formal this year; I assert that it j
is time something was done by the |
chair to eliminate the indolence |
that now stifles this body’s effec
tiveness. The tone of LASSU is '
set by the firmness of the gavel; |
this is one reason why we should
keep the president at the head of j
LASSU. This is one reason why
I call this “a time for strong and j
proven leadership.”
ROBERT N. SAYLER
Candidate for ASSU
President

On Own Merits

I would like to present briefly
my reasons for suporting Boh
Sayler for ASSU President.
1) Sayler has run on his own
merits. He has not been pushed
by “campus loaders.” He has not
I made an “unholy alliance” to as
| sign the administrative assistant’s
| position to a person who can con
-1 trol him. Chickering has. We are
electing a president and not an
administrative assistant.
2) During the course of the
1 PACE program the ASSU Presi
; dent will be called upon to speak
! for the interests of the University.
\ Salyer is well suited to represent
j Stanford across the country; he
j has been doing it for three years,
j 3) Sayler has been specific;
j Chickering has not. W’hile Sayler
I has presented practical proposals
| for student government which re
! fleet his broad experience in stu-
I dent affairs, Chickering has dealt
I in nebulous ends without regard
j to means.

views. Chickering would simply

deny the president one of his im
portant responsibilities with no

LASSU has been slow, logy, in-1

ROBERT N. SAYLER
Candidate for ASSU
President

On Own Merits

I would like to present briefly
my reasons for suporting Boh
Sayler for ASSU President.
1) Sayler has run on his own
merits. He has not been pushed
by “campus loaders.” He has not
I made an “unholy alliance” to as
| sign the administrative assistant’s
| position to a person who can con
-1 trol him. Chickering has. We are
electing a president and not an
administrative assistant.
2) During the course of the
1 PACE program the ASSU Presi
; dent will be called upon to speak
! for the interests of the University.
\ Salyer is well suited to represent
j Stanford across the country; he
j has been doing it for three years,
j 3) Sayler has been specific;
j Chickering has not. W’hile Sayler
I has presented practical proposals
| for student government which re
! fleet his broad experience in stu-
I dent affairs, Chickering has dealt
I in nebulous ends without regard
j to means.

An Endorsement

The question of the proper role
of the ASSU President in the leg
islative process is receiving undue
emphasis. I submit that the ques
tion is largely one of legislative
technique—that if Lawrie Chick
ering feels as did I that he ran be
most effective with it—fine. But
if Bob Sayler feels that he can do
more as the immediate chairman
—that too is an acceptable ap
proach. In any event, the most im
portant criteria are those that are
being largely overlooked:
1. What experience, what pre
vious indication of interest and
competence, does the candidate
offer?
2. What, has the aspirant of
fered in terms of direct, specific
solutions for the two most im
mediate present weaknesses of
the ASSU - administration and
communication?
3. How does the candidate en
vision the role of student govern
ment?
Despite the fact that my legis
lative approach differs from Bob
Sayler’s. I feel that he meets these
criteria most, fully, and it is on
this basis that I extend my en
dorsement to him.

In yesterday’s Daily Mr. Chick
ering repeated his tiresome case
for taking the gavel away from
the President at LASSU meetings.
On the eve of the election I would
like to present my stand on this
issue again and examine my op
ponent’s position for the last time.
Lawrie and I agree that the ex
ecutive branch should have a
chance to make its wishes known
to the legislators. There are three
ways this has always been done
in LASSU: 1) through the admin
istrative assistant to the presi
dent, 2) nearly always through a
legislator partial to the executive
view (as it is done in the national
government), 3) through the
ASSU President when he chooses
to relinquish the chair. The ques
tion has never been whether or
not the executive can air his opin
ions but rather which of these
three means he should use. All
Lawrie is suggesting in this re
gard is that the president, by con
stitutional amendment, be banned
from the LASSU chair, so that
he can speak when he wants to.

An Endorsement

The question of the proper role
of the ASSU President in the leg
islative process is receiving undue
emphasis. I submit that the ques
tion is largely one of legislative
technique—that if Lawrie Chick
ering feels as did I that he ran be
most effective with it—fine. But
if Bob Sayler feels that he can do
more as the immediate chairman
—that too is an acceptable ap
proach. In any event, the most im
portant criteria are those that are
being largely overlooked:
1. What experience, what pre
vious indication of interest and
competence, does the candidate
offer?
2. What, has the aspirant of
fered in terms of direct, specific
solutions for the two most im
mediate present weaknesses of
the ASSU - administration and
communication?
3. How does the candidate en
vision the role of student govern
ment?
Despite the fact that my legis
lative approach differs from Bob
Sayler’s. I feel that he meets these
criteria most, fully, and it is on
this basis that I extend my en
dorsement to him.

Strong Leadership

In yesterday’s Daily Mr. Chick
ering repeated his tiresome case
for taking the gavel away from
the President at LASSU meetings.
On the eve of the election I would
like to present my stand on this
issue again and examine my op
ponent’s position for the last time.
Lawrie and I agree that the ex
ecutive branch should have a
chance to make its wishes known
to the legislators. There are three
ways this has always been done
in LASSU: 1) through the admin
istrative assistant to the presi
dent, 2) nearly always through a
legislator partial to the executive
view (as it is done in the national
government), 3) through the
ASSU President when he chooses
to relinquish the chair. The ques
tion has never been whether or
not the executive can air his opin
ions but rather which of these
three means he should use. All
Lawrie is suggesting in this re
gard is that the president, by con
stitutional amendment, be banned
from the LASSU chair, so that
he can speak when he wants to.
Yet, he can speak when he wants
ton now. This is not a new altern
ative for presenting presidential
views. Chickering would simply

deny the president one of his im
portant responsibilities with no
new advantages added to the sys
tem. There is no need to intro
duce useless rigidity into an or
ganization that should remain as
flexible and adaptable as possible
to meet the shifting needs of the
University and the annual turn- 1
over in student personnel.
Besides presenting no new ad-1
vantages, Chickering’s proposal |
does involve some very real disad- :
vantages. The president suffers |
from acute underexposure to the
student body as it is; Lawrie’s
plan would only aggravate this
situation. Further, I don’t like to |
picture the president in the role!
of a “lobbyist” (my opponent’s j
term); this would only subtract ;
more of the respect that Lawrle 1
claims is so deficient in the office
now. Finally, the job of running !
the legislature is one of the presi- j
dent’s important functions.}
LASSU has been slow, logy, in-1
formal this year; I assert that it j
is time something was done by the |
chair to eliminate the indolence |
that now stifles this body’s effec
tiveness. The tone of LASSU is '
set by the firmness of the gavel; |
this is one reason why we should
keep the president at the head of j
LASSU. This is one reason why
I call this “a time for strong and j
proven leadership.”
