### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
Mr. Versatility: John Fulton

Ocassionally, for no reason at all, we like to dust off the record
hooks, go back through the years and take a look at some of the out
standing Stanford athletes of forgotten eras. Today we've back
tracked 18 years to the days of Johnny Fulton, one of the Farm’s
all-time best middle distance runners and certainly one of the most
versatile runners the world has ever known.
A FRAIL, THIN runner with a withered left arm, Johnny com
peted for (he Indians in 19-12 and ’44 and achieved lasting fame by
breaking or tying all but one of the “unbeatable” records set by
Lawrence E. Myers in the 19th century.
Until Fulton’s time Myers held the best all ’round track records
in the world. Lawrence had been clocked in the 100-yard dash in 10
seconds flat. In the 220 he was caught at 22.5, he ran the 440 in 48.6,
the 600 in 1:11,4, the 660 in 1 ;22.0, the 880 in 1:55.4; the 1,000 in 2:13.0
and the mile in 4:27.6. Experts thought that his times over all the dis
tances would never be matched by any one runner.
Bid Fulton confounded the experts. Before his competitive track

career was over, Johnny had
equalled Myers’ best 100 time of
10 flat, cut almost a second off
the 220 standard with a best of
21.6, run the 440 in 48.1, covered
the 660 in 1:18.9, the 880 in 1:49.5
- about six seconds faster than
Myers, the 1,000 in 2:12.8 and the
mile in 4:24.0.
THOSE times are good, even by
today’s standards. They’re better,
in fact, than anything that the
1961 Stanford trackmen were able
to do in last Saturday’s meet with
Oregon and San Jose and his 880
lime hasn’t been matched by any
one in the nation so far this year.
Fulton’s career began, oddly
enough, when he was hit by a car
fluring his youth; doctors were
lucky to save Johnny’s life and
his arm never did fully recover.
When World War II broke out
Fulton was rejected by the draft
board.

Discouraged, he drifted into track at Los Angeles High School and
found that running was something that he could do moderately well.
Fulton’s top marks in high school—a 52.5 in the 440 and a 4:43.0 in
the mile—certainly weren’t earth-shaking but they were good enough
to win him an athletic scholarship to Stanford.

OXC'E AT THE FARM Johnny got off to a fast start by setting
a frosh half-mile record of 1:54.7, a mark that stood up until 1958
when Rich Klier ran two-tenths of a second faster. After he set the
freshman record Johnny’s smooth stride got better and better.
Garnett Young, head timer at Stanford meets from 1940 to 1955
and still active as an associate docker, remembers Fulton vividly.
“He had a style all his own,” said Young. “When most runners ac
celerate you can tell that they’re putting out an extra effort by
movements in the arms or signs of strain. When Johnny ran there
wasn’t any outward indication that he was accelerating. His legs
just began to move faster. He carried his left arm in an ackward
position but it didn't bother his running.”
The unique thing about Fulton, of course, was his versatility. In
a dual meet with San Jose State in ’43 he accomplished the rare feat
of doubling in the 100 and 880 and winning both.

Dead Last
THIS ABILITY to run at all distances was also his undoing in
some meets because Johnny at times overestimated his skill in the
longer races. Once he entered the mile—his worst event —in a meet
at Kezar Stadium; the only other entrants were a top European dis
tance runner and one of the best U.S. milers from the East Coast.
The day was cold and windy and at the end of the four laps the
European was the winner with the Easterner close behind and
Johnny a very distant last.
Nineteen forty-three and forty-four were inopportune years for
Fulton to be running. College competition was dropping off and dur
ing Fulton’s senior year Stanford was declared an army training
base and intercollegiate athletics at the Farm ceased.
Due in a large part to the efforts of Johnny Fulton, Stanford
trackmen still competed in local meets, entering under the colors of
the San Francisco Olympic Club and Johnny went on to win the na
tional AAU 800-meter champion for the Winged O in 1946.
DURING THE SAME years Fulton got more opportunities to run
by taking a leave of absence from Stanford and campaigning in the
Eastern indoor meets.
“When Johnny went back East and ran in Madison Square
Garden.” recalled Young, “he got bumped around quite abit by the
heavier runners and I remember one of the New York sports col
umnists saying ‘If races are run that way the officials ought to make
the runners weigh in before the race.’”
A little humping around didn’t stop Fulton though. He went on
to a successful season on the board tracks, winning four races and
losing two others by inches in six starts. The victories, of course,
were over a variety of distances and won for him the title of the
most versatile runner of all-time.
