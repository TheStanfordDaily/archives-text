# Draft Deferment OKs Needed
## 
### 
Stanford men who are presently
classified 2-S. and those planning
to request a scholastic draft de
ferment, are reminded that their
local board will require a certifi
cation of their student status at
the end of this academic year.
The National Service Office,
room 102J, urges anyone affected
to fill out a questionnaire as soon
as possible so the necessary forms
can be returned to the local draft
board.

THOSE currently classified 2-S
are subject to reclassification to
1-A this June. If they are plan
ning to continue in school, they
must notify the local board for
continuation or reinstatement of
their 2-S and inform the local
board that Stanford will supply
the necessary forms before July
31.
Seniors who hold a 1-A classifi
cation and who are planning a
graduate program of more than
one year are especially urged by
the office to investigate the pos
sibility of a student defer ment.
A scholastic deferment may be
granted by Selective Service on
the basis of the studentâ€™s rank-in
class and/or his score on the
Selective Service College Qualifi
cation Test.
THE BANK-in-class deferment
requirements are as follows: up
per half of the freshman class,
upper two-thirds of the sopho
more class and upper three
fourths of the junior class.
Seniors, with the exception of
prospective students in law or
medicine, expecting to obtain a
deferment for graduate work
must rank in the top fourth of the
class.
Law students musk rank in the
upper three-fourths of the class
each year. Seniors planning to
work for the M.D. degree must
rank in the upper half of the
senior class.
