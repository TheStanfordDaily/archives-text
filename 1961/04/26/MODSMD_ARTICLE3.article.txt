# Why Mutiny Disintegrated—Gordon Wright

### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
The success of the abortive Al
gerian revolt depended on “light
ning action" and the capture or
assassination of President Charles
de Gaulle, Professor of History
Gordon Wright said yesterday.
Only De Gaulle held together
the opposition to the rebels and
De Gaulle could not bo beaten as
long as he was alive.

Wright emphasized that nobody
could tell for sure what the
chances for the coup in France
were. The rebels’ action was
“very risky" he felt, with the
chances for success so uncertain.
THE FBEN C II government
took the situation "very serious
ly” and appeared “genuinely
frightened,” which was shown by
De Gaulle’s invoking of the con
stitutional clause to supply him
self with near-dictatorial powers.
When De Gaulle was responsi
ble for the insertion of the clause,
he stated ho would not use it ex
cept in case of a “really dire em
ergency,” explained Wright. A
bomb attack was an example of
such an emergency then given by
the French leader.

The crucial question in France
during the four-day revolt was if
De Gaulle could come through the
crisis without being “rubbed out.”
If he had failed, Wright could see
nothing but a chaotic situation in
France.

SINCE De Gaulle has triumphed
over the rebels, he will probably
both gain and lose prestige, the
professor declared. Division in
the armed forces of a country is
always a weakening effect, he
pointed out as one of the setbacks
De Gaulle suffered.

Victory over the rebels probably
strengthened De Gaulle’s personal
position but weakened his na
tional one, Wright concluded.
Wright credited the Communist
support of Do Gaulle, as well as
the backing of the Algerian Mos
lem rebel government, to a con
scious choice of “the lesser of two
evils.” Both groups would rather
see Do Gaulle’s plans for Algeria
go through than those of the anti-
Dc Gaulle forces in Algeria and
France.
