# PACE Drive Provides for New Infirmary
## 
### 
"If a donor wore to come forth
with the money now, Stanford
could have a now infirmary with
in two and a half years,” Kenneth
Cuthbertson, vice president for
finance, announced at the begin
ning of the PACE fund drive.
The PACE program, which is
designed to raise $lOO million for
expansion of University faculty
and facilities, includes a $750,000
item for a new infirmary. The
faculty would replace the present
Stanford Health Service offices
and the rest homes, which Health
Service Director Dr. George
Houck has termed inadequate.
ALTHOUGH exact plans for
the infirmary have not been re
leased, Cuthbertson said that the
building would include adequate
office space for the health service
doctors and a minimum of in
firmary-type accommodations.
As seen by Houck, the new in
firmary would be a two-story
building located a short distance
from the post office mall area.
He hopes that the building will
include infirmary accommoda
for at least 50 students. This ca
pacity anticipates an increase in
enrollment to 10,000.

Besides providing badly-needed
office space, the infirmary would
permit communicable disease pa
tients to be isolated from the rest
of the students.
