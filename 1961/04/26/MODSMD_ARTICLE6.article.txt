# Oregon Sponsor Rebels at Rating Sex Aggression
## 
### 
EUGENE, Ore. (UPD Pickets
showed up at the University of
Oregon Monday to protest firing
of a 20-year-old girl student coun
selor who objected to rating
other girls on such questions as
their aggressiveness toward the
opposite sex.
Gayle Osburn of Salem, a red
dish blonde with freckles, re
fused to resign after her protest
about the counselor rating sys
tem. So she was fired from the
job which is worth $225 a term
in board and room.
From 10 to 15 pickets showed
up in front of the student affairs
office to protest the firing, and
the form use. About half the
pickets were male students.
MISS OSBURN, a junior major
ing in education, said she felt that
neither she nor other students
counselors were qualified to rate
girl students as required. She also
objected to secrecy of the ratings.
Among the 12 items on which
counselors, as well as house
mothers and presidents, rate the
girls is the attitude toward the
opposite sex. They have five
points from among which to
mark “over-aggressive, aggres
sive, easy and natural, somewhat
shy and antagonistic.”
Miss Osburn said she was told
the girls should not see the forms
but that they would be made
available to employers who seek
information about it.
Donald Dushane, dean of stu
dent affairs, defended the firing
and said the forms were held in
strictest confidence and used only
when a student’s problems make
it useful and helpful.
THE STUDENT newspaper,
Daily Emerald, also was in on
the dispute. It quoted Dushane
as saying information was made
available to employers only if it
would be used for the student’s
benefit. Miss Osburn retorted in
the paper that if employers knew
“the only information they would
receive would be beneficial to the
student, they wouldn’t write for
references.”
Walter Freauff, assistant direc
tor of dormitories, said that since
Miss Osburn was "not in sympa
thy with the use of this form . . .
as a counselor she has no course
but to resign.”
