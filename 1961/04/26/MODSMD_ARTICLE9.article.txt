## Con Home Plays Unique Role 
### MARY LOU McKINLEY 
The Stanford Convalescent Home is unique.
While actually separate from the University,
the Home has been connected with the campus
for 42 years. And. for the last 36 of those years,
Con Home Week has been the most important all
campus spring quarter activity.
The Home had its beginnings in 1919 when a
group of children came down to the Farm from
the Stanford Clinic in San Francisco for a summer
of sun and rest.
IN 1931 IT MOVED into the Stanford family
mansion adjoining the campus. Part of (he old
house is still used today as the Home’s physical
therapy center, while five other buildings' have
been added to the grounds.
Unique in that no other university in the coun
try can boast of such a project, the Con Home is
also exceptional in that it is completely non-sec
tarian and non-profit.
Children from 2 years old through teen-age
are admitted on the basis of their individual needs,
not their parents’ ability to pay. Thus, the greatest
part of the Home’s operating expenses are paid
through endowment funds and gifts from individ
uals. auxiliaries in the area and the Stanford stu
dent body.
six KARS AGO the Home broadened its scope
and became a licensed medical hospital and rehabil
itation center as well as a place for children to
convalesce from non-communicable diseases such
as rhumatic fever ami asthma.

Approximately 100 persons work at the Home
•occupational and physical therapists, full-time
doctors and deglstered nurses, medical social work
ers and dietitians. In addition, students from Mills,
San Jose State, the University of Wisconsin and
Stanford work there as in-training therapists on an
accredited program.
SPECIAL SCHOOL classes are taught daily, ad
ministered by the Palo Alto school district.
Since its inception, the Con Home has cared for
more than 7,000 children. It is now equipped to
handle 65 at a time.
Two main personalities have become associated
with the Home through the years. The first, Sam
McDonald, spent a good many of his years in vol
untary service projects for the children.
HIS ANNUAL barbecues for the entire student
body on the grounds of the Con Home became fa
mous. And during the war years, Sam, who died
only a few years ago, tended five acres of land
on which he raised vegetables for the young
patients.
I he second personality, the Home's administra
tor Mrs. Ruth Atwood, has been associated with
the Home for 38 years. Next week will have a spe
cial significance for her, as Monday will mark
her retirement.
Graduated from the Stanford School of Nurs
ing, Mrs. Atwood was on the White House Confer
ence on Child Health under the Hoover administra
tion.
