# TO COST MORE THAN $4.8 MILLION
## New Undergrad Library—'Reader's Paradise’ 
### JERRY RANKIN 
. . A place where an engineering major
will be found' browsing through a volume of
Keats—or a French major will wile away a
couple of hours with Einstein or Newton . .
Thus does one hopeful official portray the
future for Stanford’s long-awaited new under
graduate library which sometime in the next
four or five years will be built astride Escondido
Road behind Cubberley.
THE GRACEFUL, three-story structure has
a top priority in Stanford’s three-year $lOO mil
lion PACE drive announced last week.
The new library will draw 4,870,000 of the
PACE dollars and be an undergraduate leader’s
paradise, if a look at plans for the building are
any indication.
Designed to remove all barriers between the
reader and the book, the Stanford structure will
be the first such undergraduate library west of
the Mississippi, and only the third one in the
nation. Harvard put up the first one, followed
by the University of Michigan.

Located at the end of Escondido Road, the
library will straddle Escondido and take up the
space now occupied by part of the Stern Hall
parking lot, the Cubberley parking lot and the
“temporary” buildings behind Cubberley.
IT OBVIOUSLY will be at the hub of campus
traffic. In fact, students heading for the Quad
area from Branner, Wilbur and Stern will have
to walk through the library to reach the Engi
neering Corner area.
The ground floor will be bisected by an open
area for through pedestrian traffic—thus mak
ing it difficult for students in Wilbur-Branner-
Stern who have neglected studies to use the
traditional rationalization of “I didn’t get near
the libe today.”
One feature of the library—now in the sche
matic drawing stage- will be a three-story
glass-walled shaft, surmounted by a skylight, in
the center. This will admit light to the center
of the library and serve as a stairwell.
THE VAULTED arcade design initiated in
the year-old bookstore and post office is to be

utilized and the reinforced concrete structure
will be tupped by the Farm’s traditional I'ed
tiled roof.
The advanced planning of the library will
free students to pursue their interests as if
they were in a well-stocked home library—ex
panded about 150 times.
Eventually some 150,000 volumes on a wide
range of cultural subjects—fiction, poetry, biog
raphy, general information—will be shelved on
open, free-standing stacks.
INSTEAD OF a loft-sized reading room,
there will be many intimate reading centers, in
terspersed with stacks. Wherever a student
finds a book, ho can drop into a chair to read it.
In the view of Elmer M. Grieder, acting di
rector of libraries, the now library will ‘‘stimu
late students to vigorous exploration and criti
cal appreciation of books, and make the discov
ery of ideas exciting to them.
‘‘lt is my hope,” he said, ‘‘that I will find an
engineer there reading poetry. He will be a bet
ter-educated person and a better engineer.”
MOST OF THE 100,000 square feet of floor

space will be given over to open stacks and read
ing areas, some with study tables and some with
lounge chairs.
Outdoor reading pavilions will be spotted
around the grounds and on roof terraces formed
by the variation between two and three stories.
Besides serving as a pedestrian throughfare,
the ground floor will provide seminar rooms
and listening facilities for tapes and records
used in the music and language courses.
A LOBBY and loan facilities, a small “ready
reference” collection, general periodicals, a set
up for projecting art prints, sound-proof typing
rooms and small conference rooms also will be
put into the building.
The estimated cost of $4,870,000 covers the
building and equipment. The library will open
with about 60,000 books, with expansion of
150,000 provided for.
“At fidl development, the library should
satisfy all general reading requirements in un
dergraduate courses,” Grieder said.
“THE MAIN Library will still be the center
for specialized study and research pursuits of

undergraduates and graduates alike," he added.
The Main Library was opened in 1919 to
meet the needs of a student body and faculty
less than a fourth the size of today’s. And it
now contains more than five times as many
volumes as it did then.
The Main Library and the Western Civiliza
tion Library have about 1,000 seats for reading
and studying. The new library will break the
space jam by adding 1,500 chairs.
THE UNIVERSITY’S library system now
houses more than 1.5 million catalogued vol
umes and some 2 million publications organized
for use by other methods.
Among American private universities, Stan
ford’s ranks eighth in volumes and sixth in ex
penditures per student.
A committee of faculty and administrative
officers recently declared—in a sentiment un
doubtedly echoed silently through the years by
thousands of Stanford students—‘‘no project
could do more for undergraduate education at
Stanford than a first-class undergraduate
library.”

ing it difficult for students in Wilbur-Branner-
Stern who have neglected studies to use the
traditional rationalization of “I didn’t get near
the libe today.”
One feature of the library—now in the sche
matic drawing stage- will be a three-story
glass-walled shaft, surmounted by a skylight, in
the center. This will admit light to the center
of the library and serve as a stairwell.
THE VAULTED arcade design initiated in
the year-old bookstore and post office is to be

utilized and the reinforced concrete structure
will be tupped by the Farm’s traditional I'ed
tiled roof.
The advanced planning of the library will
free students to pursue their interests as if
they were in a well-stocked home library—ex
panded about 150 times.
Eventually some 150,000 volumes on a wide
range of cultural subjects—fiction, poetry, biog
raphy, general information—will be shelved on
open, free-standing stacks.
INSTEAD OF a loft-sized reading room,
there will be many intimate reading centers, in
terspersed with stacks. Wherever a student
finds a book, ho can drop into a chair to read it.
In the view of Elmer M. Grieder, acting di
rector of libraries, the now library will ‘‘stimu
late students to vigorous exploration and criti
cal appreciation of books, and make the discov
ery of ideas exciting to them.
‘‘lt is my hope,” he said, ‘‘that I will find an
engineer there reading poetry. He will be a bet
ter-educated person and a better engineer.”
MOST OF THE 100,000 square feet of floor

space will be given over to open stacks and read
ing areas, some with study tables and some with
lounge chairs.
Outdoor reading pavilions will be spotted
around the grounds and on roof terraces formed
by the variation between two and three stories.
Besides serving as a pedestrian throughfare,
the ground floor will provide seminar rooms
and listening facilities for tapes and records
used in the music and language courses.
A LOBBY and loan facilities, a small “ready
reference” collection, general periodicals, a set
up for projecting art prints, sound-proof typing
rooms and small conference rooms also will be
put into the building.
The estimated cost of $4,870,000 covers the
building and equipment. The library will open
with about 60,000 books, with expansion of
150,000 provided for.
“At fidl development, the library should
satisfy all general reading requirements in un
dergraduate courses,” Grieder said.
“THE MAIN Library will still be the center
for specialized study and research pursuits of

undergraduates and graduates alike," he added.
The Main Library was opened in 1919 to
meet the needs of a student body and faculty
less than a fourth the size of today’s. And it
now contains more than five times as many
volumes as it did then.
The Main Library and the Western Civiliza
tion Library have about 1,000 seats for reading
and studying. The new library will break the
space jam by adding 1,500 chairs.
THE UNIVERSITY’S library system now
houses more than 1.5 million catalogued vol
umes and some 2 million publications organized
for use by other methods.
Among American private universities, Stan
ford’s ranks eighth in volumes and sixth in ex
penditures per student.
A committee of faculty and administrative
officers recently declared—in a sentiment un
doubtedly echoed silently through the years by
thousands of Stanford students—‘‘no project
could do more for undergraduate education at
Stanford than a first-class undergraduate
library.”
. . A place where an engineering major
will be found' browsing through a volume of
Keats—or a French major will wile away a
couple of hours with Einstein or Newton . .
Thus does one hopeful official portray the
future for Stanford’s long-awaited new under
graduate library which sometime in the next
four or five years will be built astride Escondido
Road behind Cubberley.
THE GRACEFUL, three-story structure has
a top priority in Stanford’s three-year $lOO mil
lion PACE drive announced last week.
The new library will draw 4,870,000 of the
PACE dollars and be an undergraduate leader’s
paradise, if a look at plans for the building are
any indication.
Designed to remove all barriers between the
reader and the book, the Stanford structure will
be the first such undergraduate library west of
the Mississippi, and only the third one in the
nation. Harvard put up the first one, followed
by the University of Michigan.

Located at the end of Escondido Road, the
library will straddle Escondido and take up the
space now occupied by part of the Stern Hall
parking lot, the Cubberley parking lot and the
“temporary” buildings behind Cubberley.
IT OBVIOUSLY will be at the hub of campus
traffic. In fact, students heading for the Quad
area from Branner, Wilbur and Stern will have
to walk through the library to reach the Engi
neering Corner area.

MOST OF THE 100,000 square feet of floor

space will be given over to open stacks and read
ing areas, some with study tables and some with
lounge chairs.
Outdoor reading pavilions will be spotted
around the grounds and on roof terraces formed
by the variation between two and three stories.
Besides serving as a pedestrian throughfare,
the ground floor will provide seminar rooms
and listening facilities for tapes and records
used in the music and language courses.
A LOBBY and loan facilities, a small “ready
reference” collection, general periodicals, a set
up for projecting art prints, sound-proof typing
rooms and small conference rooms also will be
put into the building.
The estimated cost of $4,870,000 covers the
building and equipment. The library will open
with about 60,000 books, with expansion of
150,000 provided for.
“At fidl development, the library should
satisfy all general reading requirements in un
dergraduate courses,” Grieder said.
“THE MAIN Library will still be the center
for specialized study and research pursuits of

undergraduates and graduates alike," he added.
The Main Library was opened in 1919 to
meet the needs of a student body and faculty
less than a fourth the size of today’s. And it
now contains more than five times as many
volumes as it did then.
The Main Library and the Western Civiliza
tion Library have about 1,000 seats for reading
and studying. The new library will break the
space jam by adding 1,500 chairs.
THE UNIVERSITY’S library system now
houses more than 1.5 million catalogued vol
umes and some 2 million publications organized
for use by other methods.
Among American private universities, Stan
ford’s ranks eighth in volumes and sixth in ex
penditures per student.
A committee of faculty and administrative
officers recently declared—in a sentiment un
doubtedly echoed silently through the years by
thousands of Stanford students—‘‘no project
could do more for undergraduate education at
Stanford than a first-class undergraduate
library.”
. . A place where an engineering major
will be found' browsing through a volume of
Keats—or a French major will wile away a
couple of hours with Einstein or Newton . .
Thus does one hopeful official portray the
future for Stanford’s long-awaited new under
graduate library which sometime in the next
four or five years will be built astride Escondido
Road behind Cubberley.
THE GRACEFUL, three-story structure has
a top priority in Stanford’s three-year $lOO mil
lion PACE drive announced last week.
The new library will draw 4,870,000 of the
PACE dollars and be an undergraduate leader’s
paradise, if a look at plans for the building are
any indication.
Designed to remove all barriers between the
reader and the book, the Stanford structure will
be the first such undergraduate library west of
the Mississippi, and only the third one in the
nation. Harvard put up the first one, followed
by the University of Michigan.

Located at the end of Escondido Road, the
library will straddle Escondido and take up the
space now occupied by part of the Stern Hall
parking lot, the Cubberley parking lot and the
“temporary” buildings behind Cubberley.
IT OBVIOUSLY will be at the hub of campus
traffic. In fact, students heading for the Quad
area from Branner, Wilbur and Stern will have
to walk through the library to reach the Engi
neering Corner area.
The ground floor will be bisected by an open
area for through pedestrian traffic—thus mak
ing it difficult for students in Wilbur-Branner-
Stern who have neglected studies to use the
traditional rationalization of “I didn’t get near
the libe today.”
One feature of the library—now in the sche
matic drawing stage- will be a three-story
glass-walled shaft, surmounted by a skylight, in
the center. This will admit light to the center
of the library and serve as a stairwell.
THE VAULTED arcade design initiated in
the year-old bookstore and post office is to be

utilized and the reinforced concrete structure
will be tupped by the Farm’s traditional I'ed
tiled roof.
The advanced planning of the library will
free students to pursue their interests as if
they were in a well-stocked home library—ex
panded about 150 times.
Eventually some 150,000 volumes on a wide
range of cultural subjects—fiction, poetry, biog
raphy, general information—will be shelved on
open, free-standing stacks.
INSTEAD OF a loft-sized reading room,
there will be many intimate reading centers, in
terspersed with stacks. Wherever a student
finds a book, ho can drop into a chair to read it.
In the view of Elmer M. Grieder, acting di
rector of libraries, the now library will ‘‘stimu
late students to vigorous exploration and criti
cal appreciation of books, and make the discov
ery of ideas exciting to them.
