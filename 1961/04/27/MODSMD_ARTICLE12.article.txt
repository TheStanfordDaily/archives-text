# Top Salaries Must For Top Teachers
## 
### 
It is encouraging to note in a just published report of the
American Association of University Professors that the faculty sala
ries of United States colleges and universities have inched up about
twelve and one-half per cent during the last two years. For all
those concerned with the guality of higher education this is ex
tremely welcome news, for a university's status and worth can
well be measured in terms of its faculty. As the outline of Stan
ford's fund-raising drive stated, "upon it (the faculty) the worth of
the University primarily depends."
Unfortunately the Associationâ€™s recently completed survey of
faculty compensation at 482 types of institutions does not show
Stanford in the top 21 which reported an average faculty compen
sation of $lO,OOO a year or better. Stanford was not to be found
on the list which included the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
California, the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, Swarthmore, and
most of the well-known Ivy-League universities.
The reasons for this are two-fold and were catalogued by Pro
vost Frederick E. Terman in a report to the Board of Trustees. First,
he cites the lack of top scale pay for established professors. He
notes that Stanford must pay "more than the going rate for equiva
lent men already on our campus, and that our going rate is less
than the present salaries of such men, if they are at good schools."
Thus, Stanford's salary posture is most awkward when dealing
with the men who are most responsible for Stanford's reputation.
The second factor which Dr. Terman states is the age of the
Stanford faculty. Pointing to their over-all youngness he notes that
these men "are approaching their peak rather than receding from
it." Clearly then salaries must rise as these men reach what Dr.
Terman calls "maturation."

To meet this challenge the University has allotted one-fourth
of the PACE campaign goal to faculty improvement. To obtain
those who can make the learning process an exciting one as well
as add new knowledge to the world of scholarship, the University
plans to spend $18,509,000, first, to increase the faculty by twenty
per cent in order to meet the needs of a growing graduate pro
gram and the increasing honors and tutorial undergraduate pro
grams. Secondly, part of this sum will be used to boost present
faculty salaries by thirty-five per cent. In addition another $7,500,-
000 will be spent to add fifteen endowed chairs to Stanford's cur
rent seventeen. Endowed at one-half million each, the chairs will
bring to Stanford professors of nation-wide and world-wide scholarly
brilliance.

Wallace Stegner has stated that "Stanford is a university trem
bling on the edge of greatness." Clearly, the administration's am
bitious plans for salary increases, if they are met, should be the
main factor in pushing us over this chasm. You can't have a great
university without great teachers.
