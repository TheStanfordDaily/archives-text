## Russ Arms, Political Build-up in Cuba 
### 
President Kennedy is facing the
hard and painful dilemma posed
by Castro’s Cuban Soviet Socialist
Republic.
We are witnessing the steady
build-up of Soviet military and po
litical power in the Western hem
isphere which every United States
official says is intolerable.
HAVE NO doubt about it, more
Soviet power is going to be put
at the disposal of Castro.
But while we say that a Soviet
military and political base in the
Western hemisphere is intoler
able, we stand committed to a
policy of “non-interference” which
was made for a different world
and set of circumstances than we
now face.
The dilemma is: Do we continue
to stand aside and watch the
mounting build-up of Soviet
power in Cuba? Or do we act
alone, even if this action is un
popular with our Latin American
neighbors who prefer to close
their eyes to the problem.
BY TREATY and policy we are
bound not to interfere in the in
ternal affairs of any member of
the Organization of American
States. This is the long-standing
U.S. and inter-American policy
of non-intervention.
But through these same inter-
American treaties we are com
mitted to resist the spread of
Communism to the Western hem
isphere and penetration by any
non-American power.
By every objective test Castro
is today creating a Soviet Socialist
state in Cuba. It is tied to the So
viet Union and Red China, who
have intervened in the internal
affairs of every nation they can
get their hands on.
THE POINT I want to make is
that non-interference in the “in
ternal affairs” does not bind us
to non interference in the spread
of Communist dictatorship to the
Western hemisphere or in build
ing a Soviet military and political
base in Cuba. These two things
are not just the “internal affairs”
of Cuba; they are the external af

fairs of every democratic Western
hemisphere country.
A few weeks ago in this space
I wrote the following:
"Have we got to stand impotent
and immobile, paralyzed by the
theory of ‘non-intervention’ until
Castro (and Khrushchev) have
intervened so widely that it is too
late? ... I suggest that the un
critical acceptance of the theory
of ‘non-intervention’ covers up
the Cuban problem, keeps us from
facing it clearly.”
IN HIS address to the Ameri
can Society of Newspapers Edi
tors here this past week Presi
dent Kennedy seemed to have con
cluded that non-intervention is no
longer workable because it leaves
the Communist free to fix their
hold on Cuba while we remain
immobilized. He said:
“Should it ever appear that the
inter-American doctrine of non
interference merely conceals or
excuses a policy of non-action—if
the nations of this hemisphere
should fail to meet their commit
ments against outside Communist
penetration—then I want it clear
ly understood that this govern
ment will not hesitate in meeting
its primary obligations which are
to the security of the United
States.”

I am sure that Mr. Kennedy
means exactly what he says—that
the U.S. will not indefinitely tol
erate a Cuban Soviet Socialist
state anchored in the Communist
bloc of Russia and Red China and
that we will act alone if necessary.
Obviously the timing must be the
President’s. He will surely try to
make the American republics rea
lize that they cannot counter So
viet intervention by pretending
that it isn’t happening. It is. The
invading Cuban freedom-fighters
have been set back by Soviet
arms in Castro’s hands, but most
of them have gone to the hills,
as the President said, to cany on
the struggle of “Cuban patriots
against Cuban tyranny.” The
struggle must not be ended until
the tyranny is overthrown.
