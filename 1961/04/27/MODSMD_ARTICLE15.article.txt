# Letters to the Editor

Thanks from Pre-Reg
To all those who tried out for
Pre-Reg;
This is an extremely difficult
letter to write—to find words to
express our appreciation and our
thanks toall those who tried out for
Pre-Reg. The best word we could
use is respect—respect for the in
terest, the ideas, and the vigor
that each of the over 200 students
who came to us showed in our
committee. It will be these sug
gestions and especially the in
terest in the program that will in
fluence and vitalize our planning
for next year.
We feel that the active interest
of so many different fields is a
sign of a changing Stanford—a
Stanford that is not only looking
toward the international and na
tional but also towards the in
ternal from the Fund Stan to
PACE. We sincerely hope that
the interest shown in our com
mittee by so many very capable
people will continue to be shown
in other areas.
Again may we express a mean
ingful thank you to all of vou.

Unholy Alliances
It is ironic that one of the presi
dential candidates defeated in the
primaries, in coming out for Rob
ert Sayler for ASSU president
should speak of “unholy alli
ances,’’ when he himself is part
of just such an alliance, resem
bling that of the offering of the
Vice Presidency to four different
men at the Los Angeles conven
tion last summer. And why
shouldn’t “campus leaders” sup
port a candidate? Couldn’t it be

because in their opinion he is the
better qualified to be ASSU pres
ident? How could such campus
leaders referred have a stake in
the election when some of them
are graduating, including one of
the writers of this letter? Robert
Sayler denies having offered the
job of administrative assistant to
anyone. It is unfortunate that a
candidate for so high an office
could mock truth so blatantly,
when one of the persons that’s
implicated as part of an “unholy
alliance” was explicitly offered
such a position by Mr. Sayler.
In reference to the second part
of the endorsement, representa
tion of Stanford is referred to.
Debating is not representing
Stanford as such. It is a personal
attempt for success only involv
ing the University in so far as
debating is a recognized ASSU
endeavor. We are electing a stu
dent body president, not a de
bater.
Furthermore, Mr. Sayler lays
claim on experience, and calls for
a “strong gavel.” Where was this
strong gavel on S.T.&T. Why
was jt not till Mr. Sayler resigned
from the committee that it be
gan doing anything new and chal
lenging? It is ironic that Mr.
Sayler should take credit for the
new goals that S.T.&T. has set,
when these “new frontiers” are
the work entirely of Mr. Sayler’s
successor.
And the third point is that Mr.
Sayler has been specific and Mr.
Chickering is nebulous. The op
posite could not be more true. Of
the “21 proposals” two are iden
tical (No. 2 and No. 18), more
than half have Jong been under
way, such as “public relations
don’t” and as a final finish to his
proposals, No. 21, he “proposes”
that as a result of his “proposals”
he is the “better qualified”! Never

in student body campaigns have
we seen anything so nebulous as
these 21 “proposals.” Mr. Chick
ering, on the other hand, has been
specific, with such original and
practical plans as the Arts Coor
dination Board, Response and
need for legislative reform.
Lawrie Chickering, in our
opinion, is by far the better man.

issues Important
This has been one of the hardest
fought ASSU Presidential cam
paigns in the short history of this
University. The color of the cam
paign has been muddied by the
vicious statements of some of its
most enthusiastic participants.
This is indeed unfortunate.
I am controlled by my judg
ment and wisdom, and have not
and will not be controlled by any
individual or group. I sincerely
hope that regardless of who shall
be acclaimed victor in this cam
paign. the issues shall receive the
attention they so richly deserve.
LAWRIE CHICKERING
Vote for Candidate
On this morning of the final day
of elections I would hope that any
students who have not already
made their choice would concen
trate on the individual candidates
and not on the “extra” person
nages and “mud" surrounding
each. Vote on the basis of personal
qualifications: program, experi
ence, and ability. Vote for Bob
Sayler or Lawrie Chickering.
