# Finishing Kick

Optimism Burns Midst Fallen Hopes

The Stanford baseball team is now 1-5 in CIBA play. Only three
weeks ago the same hall club was riding high aerest a wave of nine
non-league victories against just three losses. A feeling of anxiety
and impatience had settled over the Sunken Diamond as the 50 or-so
loyal baseball fans anticipated the coming season. The Indians had
virtually the same team that finished third last year, now strength
ened by the addition of some promising sophomores. Even Coach
Dutch Fehring was thinking about that elusive CIBA crown. Maybe
this would he his year.
THAT WHICH I'KOCEDED borders on the rlisasterous. Stanford
opened at UCLA on March 31 and before they could get started, they
found themselves 0-5 with the league. The hopes and aspirations of
a whole year’s work had seemingly disappeared over night.
The effect of such an experience on a ball club could conceivably
he sweat. and snrelv it did take a toll on the fired-Up Cards. Blit

lather than giving up as one
might expect, the team kept right
on hustling and snapped back
with three straight wins. Just
what was the effect of that three
week slump on the Indians?
This was the question we posed
early one morning to the man who
would seemingly know best,
Dutch Fehring. But like most big
time college coaches, Dutch is
press conscious and will show' a
reporter no more than the dull
black and white of Don Lieben
dorfer’s official statistics.
HK IS quick to point out that
four of those first five games
were close ones which could have
gone either way. In the first three
UCLA games the Cards left a
total of 35 men on base and lost
by a total of four runs. Checking
with Mr. Liebendorfer, we con
cede that this is true, but are com-

polled to add that it would only add to (he frustration or fading con
fidence of a ball club. But, as Dutch says, “They’re playing as well
now, maybe better, than any time during the season. There’s no
change of attitude out there.’’
Staying within the confines of the record book, Dutch pointed
out that should the Indians will all their remaining games they would
finish at 11-5, a mark which could conceivably give them a tie for
the title. In fact the Indians are in no worse position than USC was
last year at this time. The Trojans were wallowing in the depths of
the second division while Cal had jumped off to an 8-0 record. SC
was 4-2, a full three games behind, hut managed to win 9 out of
t heir next 10 to overtake the Bears. The comparison, pointed out by
Dutch himself, is admittedly a flattering one and stems from that
unfailing optimism which seems to be an integral part of most
Stanford coaches.
SO, IN' HIS OWN estimation, Fehring can see no change in atti
tude or marked effect on his team’s play as a result of that three
week drought. We would suggest that if anything it has helped the
team’s performance allowing them to be more relaxed out there
when the chips are down.
As for the effect on the coach himself. ‘•Well,” pondered Dutch
as he ran a hand through his thinning gray hair, “I guess it has cost
me a few up here.”

Silence Falls Over Second Base

We couldn't help but chuckle at Bob Brockmeyer’s comment in
the San Francisco Examiner Tuesday on the Cards’ repeated wise
cracks during the Cal game. They have been brought further into the
spotlight recently by the switch of sharp-tongued Mike Magee from
catcher to second base. This not only puts the colorful popper-pot
within hailing distance of the stands, but teams him up with first
baseman Lee Moench, who is equally adept in such things.
It •seems that Tuesday Mike and Lee were assailing "the Cal ball
players, the umpires, and each other with their usual constant stream
of provocative chatter. It reached a peak when a Cal batter stepped
out of the box just as Jim Smith delivered his pitch. Scarcely had the
umpire ruled it no pitch than Magee popped off insisting that the
hitter hadn’t left the box in time.
I HE UMPIRE JUMPED out in front of the plate and shouted
to Magee “Would you rather see him go to first for hitting the
catcher s mitt with his bat ?” Magee swallowed noticeably, returned to
his position, and remained silent—at least for a few pitches.

cede that this is true, but are com-

polled to add that it would only add to (he frustration or fading con
fidence of a ball club. But, as Dutch says, “They’re playing as well
now, maybe better, than any time during the season. There’s no
change of attitude out there.’’
Staying within the confines of the record book, Dutch pointed
out that should the Indians will all their remaining games they would
finish at 11-5, a mark which could conceivably give them a tie for
the title. In fact the Indians are in no worse position than USC was
last year at this time. The Trojans were wallowing in the depths of
the second division while Cal had jumped off to an 8-0 record. SC
was 4-2, a full three games behind, hut managed to win 9 out of
t heir next 10 to overtake the Bears. The comparison, pointed out by
Dutch himself, is admittedly a flattering one and stems from that
unfailing optimism which seems to be an integral part of most
Stanford coaches.
SO, IN' HIS OWN estimation, Fehring can see no change in atti
tude or marked effect on his team’s play as a result of that three
week drought. We would suggest that if anything it has helped the
team’s performance allowing them to be more relaxed out there
when the chips are down.
As for the effect on the coach himself. ‘•Well,” pondered Dutch
as he ran a hand through his thinning gray hair, “I guess it has cost
me a few up here.”

Silence Falls Over Second Base

We couldn't help but chuckle at Bob Brockmeyer’s comment in
the San Francisco Examiner Tuesday on the Cards’ repeated wise
cracks during the Cal game. They have been brought further into the
spotlight recently by the switch of sharp-tongued Mike Magee from
catcher to second base. This not only puts the colorful popper-pot
within hailing distance of the stands, but teams him up with first
baseman Lee Moench, who is equally adept in such things.
It •seems that Tuesday Mike and Lee were assailing "the Cal ball
players, the umpires, and each other with their usual constant stream
of provocative chatter. It reached a peak when a Cal batter stepped
out of the box just as Jim Smith delivered his pitch. Scarcely had the
umpire ruled it no pitch than Magee popped off insisting that the
hitter hadn’t left the box in time.
I HE UMPIRE JUMPED out in front of the plate and shouted
to Magee “Would you rather see him go to first for hitting the
catcher s mitt with his bat ?” Magee swallowed noticeably, returned to
his position, and remained silent—at least for a few pitches.


DUTCH FEHRING
CIBA crown elusive
Optimism Burns Midst Fallen Hopes

The Stanford baseball team is now 1-5 in CIBA play. Only three
weeks ago the same hall club was riding high aerest a wave of nine
non-league victories against just three losses. A feeling of anxiety
and impatience had settled over the Sunken Diamond as the 50 or-so
loyal baseball fans anticipated the coming season. The Indians had
virtually the same team that finished third last year, now strength
ened by the addition of some promising sophomores. Even Coach
Dutch Fehring was thinking about that elusive CIBA crown. Maybe
this would he his year.
THAT WHICH I'KOCEDED borders on the rlisasterous. Stanford
opened at UCLA on March 31 and before they could get started, they
found themselves 0-5 with the league. The hopes and aspirations of
a whole year’s work had seemingly disappeared over night.
The effect of such an experience on a ball club could conceivably
he sweat. and snrelv it did take a toll on the fired-Up Cards. Blit

lather than giving up as one
might expect, the team kept right
on hustling and snapped back
with three straight wins. Just
what was the effect of that three
week slump on the Indians?
This was the question we posed
early one morning to the man who
would seemingly know best,
Dutch Fehring. But like most big
time college coaches, Dutch is
press conscious and will show' a
reporter no more than the dull
black and white of Don Lieben
dorfer’s official statistics.
HK IS quick to point out that
four of those first five games
were close ones which could have
gone either way. In the first three
UCLA games the Cards left a
total of 35 men on base and lost
by a total of four runs. Checking
with Mr. Liebendorfer, we con
cede that this is true, but are com-

polled to add that it would only add to (he frustration or fading con
fidence of a ball club. But, as Dutch says, “They’re playing as well

DUTCH FEHRING
CIBA crown elusive
Optimism Burns Midst Fallen Hopes

The Stanford baseball team is now 1-5 in CIBA play. Only three
weeks ago the same hall club was riding high aerest a wave of nine
non-league victories against just three losses. A feeling of anxiety
and impatience had settled over the Sunken Diamond as the 50 or-so
loyal baseball fans anticipated the coming season. The Indians had
virtually the same team that finished third last year, now strength
ened by the addition of some promising sophomores. Even Coach
Dutch Fehring was thinking about that elusive CIBA crown. Maybe
this would he his year.
THAT WHICH I'KOCEDED borders on the rlisasterous. Stanford
opened at UCLA on March 31 and before they could get started, they
found themselves 0-5 with the league. The hopes and aspirations of
a whole year’s work had seemingly disappeared over night.
The effect of such an experience on a ball club could conceivably
he sweat. and snrelv it did take a toll on the fired-Up Cards. Blit

lather than giving up as one
might expect, the team kept right
on hustling and snapped back
with three straight wins. Just
what was the effect of that three
week slump on the Indians?
This was the question we posed
early one morning to the man who
would seemingly know best,
Dutch Fehring. But like most big
time college coaches, Dutch is
press conscious and will show' a
reporter no more than the dull
black and white of Don Lieben
dorfer’s official statistics.
HK IS quick to point out that
four of those first five games
were close ones which could have
gone either way. In the first three
UCLA games the Cards left a
total of 35 men on base and lost
by a total of four runs. Checking
with Mr. Liebendorfer, we con
cede that this is true, but are com-

polled to add that it would only add to (he frustration or fading con
fidence of a ball club. But, as Dutch says, “They’re playing as well
now, maybe better, than any time during the season. There’s no
change of attitude out there.’’
Staying within the confines of the record book, Dutch pointed
out that should the Indians will all their remaining games they would
finish at 11-5, a mark which could conceivably give them a tie for
the title. In fact the Indians are in no worse position than USC was
last year at this time. The Trojans were wallowing in the depths of
the second division while Cal had jumped off to an 8-0 record. SC
was 4-2, a full three games behind, hut managed to win 9 out of
t heir next 10 to overtake the Bears. The comparison, pointed out by
Dutch himself, is admittedly a flattering one and stems from that
unfailing optimism which seems to be an integral part of most
Stanford coaches.
SO, IN' HIS OWN estimation, Fehring can see no change in atti
tude or marked effect on his team’s play as a result of that three
week drought. We would suggest that if anything it has helped the
team’s performance allowing them to be more relaxed out there
when the chips are down.
As for the effect on the coach himself. ‘•Well,” pondered Dutch
as he ran a hand through his thinning gray hair, “I guess it has cost
me a few up here.”

Silence Falls Over Second Base

We couldn't help but chuckle at Bob Brockmeyer’s comment in
the San Francisco Examiner Tuesday on the Cards’ repeated wise
cracks during the Cal game. They have been brought further into the
spotlight recently by the switch of sharp-tongued Mike Magee from
catcher to second base. This not only puts the colorful popper-pot
within hailing distance of the stands, but teams him up with first
baseman Lee Moench, who is equally adept in such things.
