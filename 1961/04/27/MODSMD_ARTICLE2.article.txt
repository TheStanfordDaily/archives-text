## Playwright Uses Myth In 'Knight' 
### 
Doug Johnson, who wrote the
hook and lyrics tor the spring
show “Knight in Arms,” says that
contrast between the various ele
ments in the plot and simplicity
of the love interest provide a cap
sule description of how he has
adapted the play from the Ondine
legend.
Hoddy Guittard, composer of the
score for “Knight in Arms,” which
will be presented in Memorial Au
ditorium on May 5, 6, 12 and 13.
noted that he has combined cer
tain characteristics of operetta
with those of modern musical

comedy.
JOHNSON SAID. “The atmos
phere of the bawdy peasant fish
ing village near the sea where
Ondine, the water-sprite lives,
provides a groat contrast with the
elaborate style of the court which
Hans, the knight with whom she
falls in love, comes from.
“In the middle of this is the
very simple expression of love be
tween Hans and Ondine,” Johnson
said. “They’re both leaving their
own world to live in their own
represented by the other.”
In discussing the music, Guit
tard said, “The score is really
more operetta than musical com
edy. I’ve used some of the tech
niques developed when light opera
was being performed more than
it is today. With this I’ve tried to
combine certain of the expecta
tions of modern musical comedy.”
THE SCORE contains love duets
between Hans and Ondine, sev
eral comic numbers, and a drink
ing song sung by a chorus of
fishermen and villagers. One of
the musical highlights of the show
is the underwater ballet at the
beginning of the second act.
Guittard also noted that the 36-
man orchestra is the largest ever
used in a Ram’s Head show.
Tickets for all performances are
on sale at Mem And Box Office
for $l, $1.50 and $2.
