# FIRST TIME SINCE '39
## Huskies, Indians Vie 
### 
Washington’s cinder squad, with
one win and two losses in dual
meet competition, hopes to even
the score Saturday when it plays
host to the Stanford Indians at
the University of Washington Sta
dium in Seattle.
It is the first meeting of the !
two Big Five schools since 1939 1
when the Huskies met Stanford
at Palo Alto and got pasted, !
106 1/6 to 20 5/6.
BOTH TEAMS have most of
their strength in the field events.
Stanford has point garnering abil-1
ity in the discus while the north

landers are counting on wins in
the shot and pole vault.
Husky sophomore pole vault
ace John Cramer broke the school
record last weekend at UCLA as
he vaulted 15-1% and he will be
out to better the mark against the
Cards. Don Failla is right behind
the high soaring soph with a '6l
best of 14-4 to give Washington 1
a double threat in the vault.
Shot putter Bill Buchanan is
another of Husky mentor Stan
Hiserman’s charges who might 1
put a new record in the books.
Burly Bill hit 55-914 against the
Bruins, just a quarter of an inch
behind the University standard
set by Bert Bender in 1959.
ADDING depth to the shot de
partment is 250 pound junior
Tony Angell who has a best of j
53-4 this season and a career best i
of 54-1 1 2 , and George Makela who
has a put of 53-1014 as his top
1961 performance.
UW is also potent in the jave
lin; John Douglas has thrown
222-B'i and both Tyler Stroh and
Gary Clark have been well past
190.
In the sprints Husky hopes ride
on the fleet feet of Seattleite Bob
Saunders, a senior and a two-year
letterman. Saunders churned to
a 9.7 clocking in the hundred on
a rain-drenched track last week,
just two-tenths of a second off his
fastest century of 9.5.
Saunders doubles in the 220
where he has run 20.9 while Dick
Hobbs follows with a 21.9.
AN INJURY to highly promis
ing sophomore hurdler Mike
Thrall that will probably keep
him out of the Saturday meet
dimmed Washington's chances in
the high and low barrier races,
two events where the host track
sters had counted on some valu
able first places.
If Thrall is out Hiserman will
go with Barney Olherg who has
done 14.6 in the highs and 24.4 in
the lows.
Washington has no real
strength in the longer running
events. Rick Harder has covered
the 440 in 48.6 this season but the
number two and three men, Tom
Evans and Jon Lomax, are more
than a second behind him.
HARDER doubles in the 880
With a 1:53.8 and Dennis Atkinson |
handles the mile chores, complet
ing the four-lap grind in 4:22.0.
Phil Weiser and Knut Frost ad |
have both been under ten min
utes in the two mile and could |
give the visitors trouble in the
eight-lap run.
Washington doesn’t figure to
bother the Indians much in the
high jump, discus or broad jumps |
as the respective team bests in ;
these departments have been 6-0, I
162-9’ i and 22-6 V s.
