# Greased Pole, Bikes, Mud To Highlight Sunday Follies
## 
### MARY LOU McKINLEY 
Featuring a greased pole in
stead of a diving platform, bicycle
instead of canoe races and a tug
of-war in place of the former feats
on inner tubes, the Lake Lagunita
Mud Follies Sunday afternoon
will signal the opening of the
Farm’s annual Con Homo Week.
Scheduled to begin at noon, the
Follies wall include a climb to the
top of a greased pole, a bike race
around the perimeter of the lake
and a giant ball push on the
hardly-damp lake bed.

FRATERNITIES and other
men’s residences will compete in
these various events. Last year’s
Hydrofollies saw the men of Delta
Upsilon come in first as overall
champions, with Ccdro placing
second.

Soft drinks, ice cream and hot
dogs will be sold near the boat
house, and entertainment (aside
from that featuring mud) will
also be provided.
Of necessity, the Phi Kap’s leg
endary “Aquazoo” will not go
down in the turbid “water of Lake
Lagunita this year. It will, how-

ever, be seen somewhere on Quad
during the week for those who
wish to pay tribute.
BECAUSE of their unusual na
ture. the Sunday afternoon acti
vities will be recorded on film and
shown later over television. Chan

of all races and creeds who are
suffering from severe physical
disabilities or convalescing from
