# Harvard Students Riot Over Diploma Change
## 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (UPI) Thousands of Harvard students
took to the streets of Cambridge last night in an egg-throwing,
screaming protest against the school’s switch from Latin to English
diplomas.
Harassed city police used tear gas shells and nightsticks as some
5,000 students surged out through an unlocked gate at the Harvard
Yard, overflowed into Harvard Square and snarled traffic for al
most a mile in either direction. Four students were arrested.
It was the second demonstration in the past two nights. Wednes
day night’s demonstration was more orderly, however, with a toga
clad student addressing students in Latin from the steps of venerable
Widener Library.
UNIVERSITY AUTHORITIES said last night’s protest began
mildly enough with a gathering at the steps of the library. When a
University proctor attempted to disperse the crowd, the students began
a dash to the campus gates, but found campus police there ahead of
them.
By that time, according to a proctor, “The whole damn college
was out.” The students ran to the home of university President
Nathan M. Pusey, shouting, “Latin Si. Pusey No!”
When they discovered that Pusey was not at home, they surged
into Harvard Square, main traffic artery of the city.
Two campus policemen, led by graying, distinguished-looking
Harvard College Dean John U. Monro, ran to South Street and man
aged to head off the mob at that point, but they failed to contain the
onslaught.
THE STUDENTS, WHOSE ranks had swelled by this time, began
tn pick up recruits from the Harvard residence houses along the
Charles River by that time.
Along the way, someone set off the campus fire alarm and the
clanging of the Harvard Fire Department added to the uproar.
Police apparently dispaired of clearing the square and began lob
bing team gas shells into the midst of the rioting students.
But one student said“ We’ll do this every night until we get
some action.”
