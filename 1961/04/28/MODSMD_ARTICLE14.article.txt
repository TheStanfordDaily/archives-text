# Castro Meetings Perfectly Timed
## 
### 
As the politicians and pundits look at the world effects of the
recent Cuban fiasco, private citizens, especially college students,
should closely examine the internal aftereffects.
These domestic aftereffects were, in the main, student demon
strations which occurred last week in downtown San' Francisco, at
many of the major colleges and universities in northern California,
and at the University of California at Los Angeles. These demon
strations were largely pro-Castro in flavor; the demonstrators' opin
ions could be summarized in the words of Stanford's Professor of
Economics Paul Baran, speaking at the Cuban panel last Wednesday
night in Cubberley, when he termed the recent Cuban invasions
"worse than a crime, it was a folly."
Our quarrel, however, does not ekist in the viewpoints of these
protestors, though we believe that the Institute of International Re
lations should have made a stronger effort to find an anti-Castro
speaker to balance the panel. It lies in the rapidity with which
these demonstrations were organized. President Clark Kerr of the
University of California, speaking at a Board of Regents meeting
last Saturday in Los Angeles said, "I am not surprised such demon
strations took place. But what concerns me most as a citizen was
the very quick organization that took place. This did not just hap
pen. Some mechanism was involved. But what mechanism was
used, I do not know." The Stanford meeting, timed either by co
incidence or plan, to coincide with the other pro-Castro meetings,
was held right in the middle of the kick-off of a $lOO million PACE
campaign with more than 20 newspaper reporters on the campus.
In addition a good percentage of the audience were neither stu
dents nor little old ladies from Palo Alto, but rather older men and
women, well-scattered through the audience.
These were the ones who heavily applauded the pro-Castro
statements. Their rabid cheering sometimes gave the impression
that the whole audience was pro-Castro when it was not. Clearly
the strong chairman and the sensibility of the students prevented
the match being lighted to a well-constructed bonfire.
The rallies and meetings for Cuba are still being held. Students
who attend should keep both eyes and ears wide open, and not
be carried away by a pre-planned circus atmosphere.

University of California, speaking at a Board of Regents meeting
last Saturday in Los Angeles said, "I am not surprised such demon
strations took place. But what concerns me most as a citizen was
the very quick organization that took place. This did not just hap
pen. Some mechanism was involved. But what mechanism was
used, I do not know." The Stanford meeting, timed either by co
incidence or plan, to coincide with the other pro-Castro meetings,
was held right in the middle of the kick-off of a $lOO million PACE
campaign with more than 20 newspaper reporters on the campus.
In addition a good percentage of the audience were neither stu
dents nor little old ladies from Palo Alto, but rather older men and
women, well-scattered through the audience.
These were the ones who heavily applauded the pro-Castro
statements. Their rabid cheering sometimes gave the impression
that the whole audience was pro-Castro when it was not. Clearly
the strong chairman and the sensibility of the students prevented
the match being lighted to a well-constructed bonfire.
The rallies and meetings for Cuba are still being held. Students
who attend should keep both eyes and ears wide open, and not
be carried away by a pre-planned circus atmosphere.
