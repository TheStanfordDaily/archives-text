## Timidity Worse Course In Cuban Situation 
### 
The question now is not who’s
the blame for the fiasco in Cuba—
but what next? How will the U.S.
respond to this initial failure?
The temptation is to look for a
scapegoat. Some within the Ad
ministration are already trying to
blame the Eisenhower administra
tion for the amateurish and in
adequate invasion.

FORTUNATELY President
Kennedy himself is having no
part of this “Operation Politics.”
He knows he could have vetoed
the invasion which was being pre
pared under Mr. Eisenhower dur
ing the past year and that it was
his responsibility to determine the
time and the circumstances under
which it was undertaken. Neither
he nor Secretary Rusk are shift
ing the responsibility to any
shoulders other than their own.
That’s good.
There should be a post-mortem
on what went wrong. But the pur
pose should be primarily to find
out what we now need to do to
bring about the success of the
anti-Castro revolution, not pri
marily to throw up some scape
goat at whom to shuttle the
blame.

Failure is tolerable if President
Kennedy makes it clear that he
is preparing to succeed.
ONE DANGER is that Mr. Ken
nedy may conclude that this first
failure in Cuba will create such
political division and partisan con
troversy in the United States that
he will not be free to take a bold
and riskful course of action in the
next few months.
I am convinced that the exact
opposite is the truth—that timid
ity toward the Castro regime will
divide the country and that full
steam-ahead preparation to pre
vent further up building of a So
viet-supported Castro regime will
unite U.S, political leadership and
will unite the American people.
Timidity alone will divide the
country.
If I am correctly informed, for
mer President Eisenhower and
former Vice President Richard
Nixon have assured Mr. Kennedy
that he will have their backing in
any measures to carry out the

commitment he made to the
American Society of Newspaper
Editors last week.

Referring to the tragic end of
the Hungarian freedom fighters,
he flatly stated that the U.S. will
“not accept the same outcome
which this small band of gallant
Cuban refugees must have known
they were chancing.”
If President Kennedy refuses
“to accept the same outcome” for
the Cuban freedom-fighters as be
fell the Hungarian freedom-fight
ers, then he i« saying that the
U.S. is determined to insure the
success of the anti-Castro Cuban
revolution.
This is what the American peo
ple want to hear. This is what the
American people want to see.
IT IS WELL that Gen. Maxwell
D. Taylor, former Chief of Staff
for the Army, is taking a new look
at our capabilities—and short
comings—in unconventional war
fare and intelligence. Gen. Taylor
is the right man to do it because
he has long been dissatisfied with
our limited war operations.
But what will count will be the
follow-up. Inadequate intelligence
may well have contributed some
what to the failure of the inva
sion. But this is not the heart of
the problem. The need is to in
crease radically the whole range
of our means to combat Commu
nist techniques of take-over by in
filtration and subversion. As an
essential first step we must, I
think, get a single, unified com
mand of all U.S. resources to be
used to counter Communist con
quest short-of-war.
What the President may well
have in mind is that Gen. Taylor
will reach this conclusion and will
be so convinced of its necessity
that he will be willing to take the
job himself.
Economic aid to other Latin
American countries is not going
to bring down Castro. That’s wish
ful thinking. Now fully warned
of his danger, Castro will be get
ting more Soviet arms. In another
six or eight months he may be
nearly impregnable. Just to wait
and hope for the best is the way
of bringing about the worst.

The question now is not who’s
the blame for the fiasco in Cuba—
but what next? How will the U.S.
respond to this initial failure?
The temptation is to look for a
scapegoat. Some within the Ad
ministration are already trying to
blame the Eisenhower administra
tion for the amateurish and in
adequate invasion.

FORTUNATELY President
Kennedy himself is having no
part of this “Operation Politics.”
He knows he could have vetoed
the invasion which was being pre
pared under Mr. Eisenhower dur
ing the past year and that it was
his responsibility to determine the
time and the circumstances under
which it was undertaken. Neither
he nor Secretary Rusk are shift
ing the responsibility to any
shoulders other than their own.
That’s good.
There should be a post-mortem
on what went wrong. But the pur
pose should be primarily to find
out what we now need to do to
bring about the success of the
anti-Castro revolution, not pri
marily to throw up some scape
goat at whom to shuttle the
blame.

Failure is tolerable if President
Kennedy makes it clear that he
is preparing to succeed.
ONE DANGER is that Mr. Ken
nedy may conclude that this first
failure in Cuba will create such
political division and partisan con
troversy in the United States that
he will not be free to take a bold
and riskful course of action in the
next few months.
I am convinced that the exact
opposite is the truth—that timid
ity toward the Castro regime will
divide the country and that full
steam-ahead preparation to pre
vent further up building of a So
viet-supported Castro regime will
unite U.S, political leadership and
will unite the American people.
Timidity alone will divide the
country.
If I am correctly informed, for
mer President Eisenhower and
former Vice President Richard
Nixon have assured Mr. Kennedy
that he will have their backing in
any measures to carry out the

commitment he made to the
American Society of Newspaper
Editors last week.

Referring to the tragic end of
the Hungarian freedom fighters,
he flatly stated that the U.S. will
“not accept the same outcome
which this small band of gallant
Cuban refugees must have known
they were chancing.”
If President Kennedy refuses
“to accept the same outcome” for
the Cuban freedom-fighters as be
fell the Hungarian freedom-fight
ers, then he i« saying that the
U.S. is determined to insure the
success of the anti-Castro Cuban
revolution.
This is what the American peo
ple want to hear. This is what the
American people want to see.
IT IS WELL that Gen. Maxwell
D. Taylor, former Chief of Staff
for the Army, is taking a new look
at our capabilities—and short
comings—in unconventional war
fare and intelligence. Gen. Taylor
is the right man to do it because
he has long been dissatisfied with
our limited war operations.
But what will count will be the
follow-up. Inadequate intelligence
may well have contributed some
what to the failure of the inva
sion. But this is not the heart of
the problem. The need is to in
crease radically the whole range
of our means to combat Commu
nist techniques of take-over by in
filtration and subversion. As an
essential first step we must, I
think, get a single, unified com
mand of all U.S. resources to be
used to counter Communist con
quest short-of-war.
