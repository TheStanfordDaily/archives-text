# Indians, Huskies To Match Strides
## 
### 
Fifteen members of the Stanford track team leave this afternoon
for Seattle and a dual meet clash with the Washington Huskies to
morrow afternoon. Of this group only one is a senior and eight are
sophomores.
While Stanford has not done too well in meet scoring so far,

several of these young perform
ers have recorded notable marks
in their particular events.
JUNIOR co-captain Rich Klier,
for example, ran a 1:51.1 half-mile
in the triangular meet with San I
Jose Slate and Occidental. His
mark is one of the better recorded
over 880 yards so far this season.
Junior javelin thrower Art
Batchelder unleashed a 233-3 ef
fort against San Jose and Okla
j homa. Although he could not
come up with his usual fine per
-1 formance last week it must be
j noted that it was chilly and the
j turf was very wet.
■ Stanford’s best depth to date
! has been in the discus throw and
the broad jump. In the discus, 6-7
sophomore Dave Weill and junior
co-captain Don Bell have been con
sistent point getters.
BOTH HAD the best tosses of
their lives last Saturday against
| USC and Oregon. Weill won the
event with a toss of 175 feet, de
feating NCAA record holder Jim
Wade of SC head-to-head.
Bell finished third with a spin
of 171-11.
| In the broad jump sophomore
Dan Moore, junior Charles Barth
land senior Craig Barrett have all
added points to the Card effort.
MOORE, the national freshman
broad jump champion two years
| ago has been improving this year,
j after having suffered a leg in
jury last spring which kept him
out of competition. He has gone
as well as 25-1 and barely missed
pushing 26 feet last week when
his foot just crossed the take off
bar for a foul.
The Indians will enter the
Washington meet without the
services of their top sprinter Len
Breschini. The chunky junior suf
fered a slight muscle pull in his
leg after running the 100-yard
dash in last week’s triangular and
is being held out of action this
weekend.

Stanford’s tough weightman’s
relay team will also compete in
the meet. Don Bell, Chris Stack,
Art Batchelder and Dave Weill
make up the massive baton pass
ing outfit, but surprisingly the
four have run 44.8 for the 440
yards.

Breschini. The chunky junior suf
fered a slight muscle pull in his
leg after running the 100-yard
dash in last week’s triangular and
is being held out of action this
weekend.

Stanford’s tough weightman’s
relay team will also compete in
the meet. Don Bell, Chris Stack,
Art Batchelder and Dave Weill
make up the massive baton pass
ing outfit, but surprisingly the
four have run 44.8 for the 440
yards.
Fifteen members of the Stanford track team leave this afternoon
for Seattle and a dual meet clash with the Washington Huskies to
morrow afternoon. Of this group only one is a senior and eight are
sophomores.
While Stanford has not done too well in meet scoring so far,

several of these young perform
ers have recorded notable marks
in their particular events.
JUNIOR co-captain Rich Klier,
for example, ran a 1:51.1 half-mile
in the triangular meet with San I
Jose Slate and Occidental. His
mark is one of the better recorded
over 880 yards so far this season.
Junior javelin thrower Art
Batchelder unleashed a 233-3 ef
fort against San Jose and Okla
j homa. Although he could not
come up with his usual fine per
-1 formance last week it must be
j noted that it was chilly and the
j turf was very wet.
■ Stanford’s best depth to date
! has been in the discus throw and
the broad jump. In the discus, 6-7
sophomore Dave Weill and junior
co-captain Don Bell have been con
sistent point getters.
BOTH HAD the best tosses of
their lives last Saturday against
| USC and Oregon. Weill won the
event with a toss of 175 feet, de
feating NCAA record holder Jim
Wade of SC head-to-head.
Bell finished third with a spin
of 171-11.
| In the broad jump sophomore
Dan Moore, junior Charles Barth
land senior Craig Barrett have all
added points to the Card effort.
MOORE, the national freshman
broad jump champion two years
| ago has been improving this year,
j after having suffered a leg in
jury last spring which kept him
out of competition. He has gone
as well as 25-1 and barely missed
pushing 26 feet last week when
his foot just crossed the take off
bar for a foul.
The Indians will enter the
Washington meet without the
services of their top sprinter Len
Breschini. The chunky junior suf
