# Freshman Spikers Triumph
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman track
team, rated No. 2 nationally de
feated the San Jose State fresh
man, rated No. 1, yesterday after
noon at Stanford. The score was
79-52.
Last year the Spartans were
the top-ranked freshman track
squad in the nation.
THE TURNING point in the ex
citing meet came when Handsel
Minyard of Stanford leaped 22-8G
in the broad jump on his final try,
to fly from third to first in the
■standings.
The meet was actually rapped
up for the Cards when they fash
ioned a brilliant sweep in the two
mile run. Dave Stone (10:07).
Larry Schaefer (10:11.7) and
George Pilz (10:12.8) were the
men w'ho completed the coup.
Perhaps even more outstanding
for the victors were speedsters
Bill Pratt and Robin Ruble.
Pratt captured the mile in 4:15.7
with Ruble third in 4:19.4.
1 Pratt’s time is a new freshman
record breaking the old standard
held by Keith Wallace of 4:16.3
set in 1958.
THEY WERE reversed in the
880 with Ruble hitting the tape
first in a fine 1 ;56.3, just nipping
Pratt who was clocked in 1:56.6.
Steve Arch also set a new frosh
mark when he heaved the shot
54-C. in finishing second behind
State’s Pat Kelso. Kelso got off
a put of 55-4 Vt.
A happy surprise for Coach
Payton Jordan was the fine ef
fort of Rich Chesarek in the quar
ter. Chesarek sped the distance in
48.7.
THE CARDS swept the javelin
event behind the healthy heaves
of Graham Gilmer, Rich Watson
and Chick Hastings. Gilmer’s win
ning mark was 180-1 V>.
Steve Cortright ran his best
times of the season in finishing
second in both the 120-yard high
hui’dles and the 220-yard low hur
dles. His times were 14.7 and 23,9.
The Card spikers were extreme
ly happy following the meet and
took the time to go on record as
thanking the crowd that turned
out.
