# Card Nine Journeys South, Meets Trojans
## 
### 
i The Indians invade McKeever
| ville this weekend for a pair of
i baseball games with the powerful
Southern California Trojans.
; The Trojans are currently tied
for the lead of the CIHA with
UCLA with a 6-2 conference mark.
This includes a 3-2 triumph over
Stanford earlier in the season.
THE NATIONAL college base
ball ratings list the Trojans as the
number one team in the nation,
and the Figgeroans won’t want to
lose their rating to a pair of de
feats at the hands of Stanford.
Stanford Coach Dutch Fehring
has nominated junior right-hander
j Jim Smith to pitch the Friday
opener of the two-game series, but
he is undecided as to whether
Marv Mecklenberg or Mark Mil
ler will pitch Saturday. Miller re
ceived the defeat for the loss in
the SC game earlier this year, al
though hg pitched well.
Fehring will go with (he same
lineup that defeated California
and USF already this week: Bob
Overman, catcher; Leo Moench,
first base; captain Mike Magee,
second base; Rich Ferrazzano,
third base; Joel Shulman, short
stop; John Hurlbut, left field; Hal
Schutzmann, center field; and
Skip Lawrence, right field.
STANFORD is in the CIBA cel
lar with a 1-5 league record, but
they have rebounded after a
“black weekend” in which they
lost a single game to Southern
Cal and a double header to UCLA,
| by dumping California from the
league lead, taking a ho-hum con
test from USF, and trouncing San
Jose State.
' The Indians’ spirit is high. Any

team with the likes of Moench
and Magee to wisecrack and even
keep the umpires alert will never
be out-fought.
The Card bascbaUers are hitting [
pretty well as a team now, and
Coach Fehring hopes that the
power will continue. John Hurl
but has been blasting the ball as
of late.

i The Indians invade McKeever
| ville this weekend for a pair of
i baseball games with the powerful
Southern California Trojans.
; The Trojans are currently tied
for the lead of the CIHA with
UCLA with a 6-2 conference mark.
This includes a 3-2 triumph over
Stanford earlier in the season.
THE NATIONAL college base
ball ratings list the Trojans as the
number one team in the nation,
and the Figgeroans won’t want to
lose their rating to a pair of de
feats at the hands of Stanford.
Stanford Coach Dutch Fehring
has nominated junior right-hander
j Jim Smith to pitch the Friday
opener of the two-game series, but
he is undecided as to whether
Marv Mecklenberg or Mark Mil
ler will pitch Saturday. Miller re
ceived the defeat for the loss in
the SC game earlier this year, al
though hg pitched well.
Fehring will go with (he same
lineup that defeated California
and USF already this week: Bob
Overman, catcher; Leo Moench,
first base; captain Mike Magee,
second base; Rich Ferrazzano,
third base; Joel Shulman, short
stop; John Hurlbut, left field; Hal
Schutzmann, center field; and
Skip Lawrence, right field.
STANFORD is in the CIBA cel
lar with a 1-5 league record, but
they have rebounded after a
“black weekend” in which they
lost a single game to Southern
Cal and a double header to UCLA,
| by dumping California from the
league lead, taking a ho-hum con
test from USF, and trouncing San
Jose State.
' The Indians’ spirit is high. Any

team with the likes of Moench
and Magee to wisecrack and even
keep the umpires alert will never
be out-fought.
