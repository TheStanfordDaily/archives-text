# Surprise: Neutron Looks Like Proton
## 
### 
A Stanford research team
Wednesday presented a new pic
ture of the proton and neutron—
basic building blocks of matter—
which appears to show they are
much simpler than had been sup
posed.

The team, headed by Prof. Rob
ert Hofstadter, reported to the
American Physical Society at a
Washington, D.C.. meeting that
the proton and neutron appear to
he “merely two different aspects

of a single entity.”
All atoms heavier than simple
hydrogen have nuclei, or cores,
consisting of positively charged
particles called protons jammed
cheek by jowl with neutral parti
cles called neutrons.
AFTER SEVEN years of re
search, the Stanford group con
cluded that both particles are com
posed entirely of mesons, some
times referred to as the glue
which holds together components
of the nucleus.

The scientists gave this picture
of an atom’s nucleus:

Elach proton and neutron has an
extremely dense, point-like meson
core surrounded by two clouds of
mesons. This structure resembles
that of the entire atom, which is
a nucleus of protons and neutrons
surrounded by shells or clouds of
moving electrons.
The meson clouds of the proton
and neutron are the same size and
shape and intermingle to keep the
nucleus from breaking up.
INFORMATION gleaned with
high energy atom smashers had

indicated lhat the neutron and
proton contained more than 30 ele
mentary particles.

“If our results are correct,”
Hofstadter said, “the structure of
proton and neutron is much sim
pler than we expected.”

The researchers examined nu
clei with a 150-ton. million-watt,
$500,000 magnetic spectrometer.
It measures electron scattering
from hydrogen and deuterium nu
clei under bombardment by the
University’s billion-volt, linear ac
celerator, prototype of the cur
rently proposed two-mile $ll4 mil
lion machine.
