# LIBRARY REPORT:
## Stacks Closed Sundays—No Money 
### 
The stacks will not be open on
Sunday evenings this quarter due
to a lack of funds to staff the li
brary, says E. M. Grieder, acting
director.

Hours for the library this quar
ter are 811 Monday through Fri
day. 8-5 Saturday, and 1-5 Sunday.
The reserve book room i« open
until 11 on Saturday and Sunday,
and the Western Civ Library is
open until 10:15 p.m. every night.
WINTER quarter the stacks
were opened to students from 5-11
p.m., but the messy condition of
the stacks on Monday morning
created a great maintenance prob
lem. Abuses of books and cards,
taking of food into the stacks, and
stealing also created problems.
The library did not have the funds
to pay experienced help to over
see the stacks during the extended
hours on Sunday and on week

nights from 10-11, Grieder said,
and only student help was pres
ent.
No extra funds were used to
pay help last quarter but savings
not available this quarter were
used. Since the week-night ex
tensions worked satisfactorily
they have been continued this
quarter.
“WE WOE El) gladly open the
stacks if we had the staff,” empha
sized Grieder, but ho explained
that the library cannot risk the
abuses of last quarter.
An experienced librarian is
needed in the building at all times
to tend to any emergencies as well
as to watch the stacks, Grieder re
marked. He cited an incident of
several years ago when a hoy
tried to light a bonfire in a stack
aisle.
Asked about next year's plans,

Grieder said there is a possibility
of opening the stack on Sunday
nights. Estimates and examina
tions with the University admin
istration are going on, but there
is “no present assurance” of fur
ther action. Grieder concluded.
MORE LIBRARY time and ac
cess is definitely needed by the
students for two important rea
sons, Grieder feels. First, the in
creased demands on students by
the faculty cause them to make
more extensive use of library fa
cilities, and. second, dorms are
overcrowded and difficult for

studying.
Counts taken of library users
last quarter showed that the ex
tension was worthwhile, con
firmed Grieder. While the use was
about half the daily average, the
number of night users increased
decidedly during the quarter.

brary, says E. M. Grieder, acting
director.

Hours for the library this quar
ter are 811 Monday through Fri
day. 8-5 Saturday, and 1-5 Sunday.
The reserve book room i« open
until 11 on Saturday and Sunday,
and the Western Civ Library is
open until 10:15 p.m. every night.
WINTER quarter the stacks
were opened to students from 5-11
p.m., but the messy condition of
the stacks on Monday morning
created a great maintenance prob
lem. Abuses of books and cards,
taking of food into the stacks, and
stealing also created problems.
The library did not have the funds
to pay experienced help to over
see the stacks during the extended
hours on Sunday and on week

nights from 10-11, Grieder said,
and only student help was pres
ent.
No extra funds were used to
pay help last quarter but savings
not available this quarter were
used. Since the week-night ex
tensions worked satisfactorily
they have been continued this
quarter.
“WE WOE El) gladly open the
stacks if we had the staff,” empha
sized Grieder, but ho explained
that the library cannot risk the
abuses of last quarter.
An experienced librarian is
needed in the building at all times
to tend to any emergencies as well
as to watch the stacks, Grieder re
marked. He cited an incident of
several years ago when a hoy
tried to light a bonfire in a stack
aisle.
Asked about next year's plans,

Grieder said there is a possibility
of opening the stack on Sunday
nights. Estimates and examina
tions with the University admin
istration are going on, but there
is “no present assurance” of fur
ther action. Grieder concluded.
MORE LIBRARY time and ac
cess is definitely needed by the
students for two important rea
sons, Grieder feels. First, the in
creased demands on students by
the faculty cause them to make
more extensive use of library fa
cilities, and. second, dorms are
overcrowded and difficult for

studying.
Counts taken of library users
last quarter showed that the ex
tension was worthwhile, con
firmed Grieder. While the use was
about half the daily average, the
number of night users increased
decidedly during the quarter.
The stacks will not be open on
Sunday evenings this quarter due
to a lack of funds to staff the li
brary, says E. M. Grieder, acting
director.
