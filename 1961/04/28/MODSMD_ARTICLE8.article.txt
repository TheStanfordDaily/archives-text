The office of AWS president
turned out to be a sticky problem.
Although Pat Christenson re
ceived more votes than Linda
Gogins, Miss Gogins won by de
fault because Miss Christenson
had refused the office in writing.
BECAUSE on the primary bal
lot there were no candidates for
AWS president, many names were
written-in, including both Miss
Gogins’ and Miss Christenson’s,
Miss Christenson declined the of
fice before the election, but not
before the ballots had been sent
to the printers. Consequently Miss
Christenson’s name appeared on

Stanford voters handed ASSU presidential candidate Bob Sayler
a landslide victory in the final elections yesterday. When the votes
were tallied, Sayler had run up a total of 1,744 to his opponent Lawrie
Chickering's 776.

Remarking on his sweeping vicl
certainly pleased with the vote, in it
is important is that I receive the c
body in order to achieve the dyna
been the basis of my platform. I

lory, Sayler said, "Although I am
[self it is rather unimportant. What
:ontinuing support of the student
imic student government that has
feel that this election is not the
end, but the beginning."
In sharp contrast to Sayler’s al
most 1,000 vote margin of victory,
the competition for Men’s Row
representative proved that every
single vote does count. Candidate
Alex Woodard totaled 182 votes,
to boat his opponent, Bill Broil,
who totaled 181. The one-vote dif
ference was chocked three times,
each time with the same result.

DAVE WILLIAMS triumphed
over Sandy Pofahl for Class of
1963 president, winning 407 votes
to Pofahl's 275.

In the competition for Stern
representative to Legislature Bill
Callison received 140 votes, win
ning over his opponent Bob Oaks,
who received 106.

The office of AWS president
turned out to be a sticky problem.
Although Pat Christenson re
ceived more votes than Linda
Gogins, Miss Gogins won by de
fault because Miss Christenson
had refused the office in writing.
BECAUSE on the primary bal
lot there were no candidates for
AWS president, many names were
written-in, including both Miss
Gogins’ and Miss Christenson’s,
Miss Christenson declined the of
fice before the election, but not
before the ballots had been sent
to the printers. Consequently Miss
Christenson’s name appeared on
the ballot.
