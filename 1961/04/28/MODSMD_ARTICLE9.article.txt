# Let Daily Funds Alone – LASSU
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
In an unusually swift, 45-min
ute meeting, Legislature last
night decided to leave the alloca
tion of money to The Daily under
the current setup.

A motion introduced last week
by Business School Representa
tive Pete Crumbine would have
taken the 75 cents the paper cur
rently receives directly from the
tuition of each student and put it
into the general ASSU fund, with
The Dally then receiving what
LASSU decided to give it.

BUT ED Cutter, administrative
assistant to ASSU President
Larry Royse, said the motion
would give the Legislature no
more power than it already has
in effect.

Crumbine said he had proposed
the motion “in response” to Daily
Editor Maynard Parker’s leaking
news to the paper of an executive
session of LASSU two weeks ago,
and voted with all but one legis
lator against taking it out of By
law and Rules Committee for dis
cussion.

LASSU ALSO approved a by
laws change making it the re
sponsibility of the student finan
cial manager or the administra
tive assistant to notify persons or
groups when matters concerning
them are due to come up before
Legislature.
The group also okayed the re
port of Elna Rodenhouse, Elec
tions Commission chairman, on
the final balloting. Miss Roden
house explained that polls at vari
ous spots on campus wore closed
early during final elections be
cause election workers failed to
show up on schedule, and she did
not want to leave polls unguarded.
