LUCKY STRIKE PRESENTS:
DOELDRiFrOoD:
DR. FROOD'S THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: A lllllc learning CUtl
he a dangerous thing—especially in a multiple-choice exam.
A
DEAR DR. FROOD: I have calculated that if the population explosion
continues at its present rate, there will be a person for every square
foot of earth by the year 2088. What do you think of that?
Statistics Major
DEAR STATISTICS: Well, one thing's sure, that will finish off the hula
hoopers—once and for all.
DEAR DR. FROOD: I have been training our
college mascot, a goat. He has learned how to
open a pack of Luckies, take out a cigarette,
light up and smoke. Do you think I can get
him on a TV show?
Animal Husbandry Major
DEAR ANIMAL: I’m afraid not. To make TV now
adays, you've got to have an act that's really
different. After all, there are millions of Lucky
smokers.
DEAR DR. FROOD: I am a full professor—and
yet I stay awake nights worrying about my abil
ity to teach today s bright young college stu
dents. They ask questions I can't answer. They
write essays I don't understand. They use com
plicated words that I’ve never heard before.
How can I possibly hope to win the respect of
students who are more learned than I am?
Professor
DEAR PROFESSOR: I always maintain that noth
ing impresses a troublesome student like the
sharp slap of a ruler across his outstretched
palm.
C ro f r-
I 'V
DEAR DR. FROOD; You can tell your readers for me that
college is a waste of time. My friends who didn't go to
college are making good money now. And me. with my
new diploma? I’m making peanuts!
Angry Grad
DEAR ANGRY: Yes, but how many of your friends can do
what you can do—instantly satisfy that overpowering
craving for a peanut.

DEAR DR. FROOD; Could you give a word of
advice to a poor girl who, after four years at
college, has failed to get herself
invited on a single date?
Miss Miserable
DEAR MISS: Mask?
THE RECRUITERS ARE COMING! THE RECRUITERS ARE COMING! And here's Frood to tell
you just how to handle them; These representatives of big business are, on the whole,
alert fellows. They may be aware that college students smoke more Luckies than any other
regular. Let them know that you know what's up—offer them a Lucky, then tap your cranium
knowingly. Remember—today s Lucky smoker could be tomorrow's Chairman of the Board.
