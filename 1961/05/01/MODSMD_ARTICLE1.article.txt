# Report on Unrest at an American University
## 
### 
(Editor’s Note: Late in March, Bowling
Green State University in northwestern Ohio,
a typical American campus, was rocked by a
series of student demonstrations. Adminis
tration officials dismissed the disturbances
as “spring fever” but many students claimed
the roofs lay deeper—in a steady encroach
ment of their academic and personal free
doms. The conflict is one that lias parallels
in colleges across tin- country. In the follow
ing dispatch, a UPI correspondent reports on
its repercussions—actual and potential.)
BY BEKNKKD 11. BUTLER
BOWLING GREEN, Ohio (UPD—Bowling
Green State University in this modest north
western Ohio community of 8,000, about 20
miles south of Toledo, appears much the
same as other state universities.
The school, founded in 1910, is known for
its high academic standards and fine athletic
teams, particularly football and basketball.
But in March this typical state university
campus became the scene of a three-day
demonstration, involving upwards of 2,000 of
its 6,000 students. The disturbances on
March 26-27-28 reached the point where the
university president declared a state of emer
gency and called in the state patrol. At one
point, the demonstrators surged into the
community, alarming many of the towns
people although there was no violence.
SOME INVOLVED in the demonstrations,
including several who were expelled, went to
Columbus to air grievances before a legisla
tive committee. One called the governor to
complain about the treatment of students at
the university.

What is the feeling on the campus now—
weeks after the demonstrations—about what
lay behind them.

Students generally blame the administra
tion of Dr. Ralph W. McDonald, university
president for the past 10 years, who they
claim is a stern, unyielding disciplinarian
who treats them as juveniles.

McDONALD came here in 1951 from Wash
ington where he had been head of the Na
tional Education Association’s division of
higher education. He also had been president
of the National Committee on Atomic En
orgy, predecessor to the Atomic Energy Com
mission.

McDonald. 59, a native of Illinois, ran for
governor of North Carolina in 1936 as a
“Democratic Liberal” but lost by a 3,000 vote
margin when the absentee ballots were
counted.

Both students and faculty admire what he
has accomplished in his drive to improve the
facilities and academic standing of the school.
But students maintain his rules are dicta
torial and are enforced in a “Gestapo-like”
manner by the campus police.
SOME OF THE faculty appear to lean to
ward the students' cause, but take no official
stand. Many students contend faculty mem
bers fear to speak out because of possible
loss of their jobs.
The administration seems solidly behind
McDonald.

McDonald speaks with fervor and anima
tion of the growth of BG since he became
president. He stresses that the students con
sist mainly of top scholars from the high
school graduating classes in Ohio.
“OUR university gets the serious-minded

students because of its strict regulations and
its fine reputation. The idea has gone abroad
somehow that Bowling Green is a place to
get a good education,” he said.
Enrollment has doubled since 1954. Last
year, he says, the school turned away 2,000
students because of lack of facilities.
He blames “little pressures” brought on by
overcrowding for the disturbances. He said
the school, which primarily is a resident uni
versity, has about 4,500 students living in a
quarter mile square area, mostly freshman
women.
DESPITE THE enrollment, he said, the
school provides a “top notch” education but
cannot alleviate the pressures of overcrowded
living facilities, cafeterias, libraries and other
areas until more buildings are constructed.
“I am very much on the side of the stu
dents,” he says. “Our basic aims and pur
poses are the same.”

McDonald and other administration offi
cials feel the demonstrations were nothing
more than spring fever that got out of con
trol.
BUT A sampling of students indicated they
feel that the demonstrations which began as
a harmless water fight actually developed
into what they described as a widespread
protest of policies. They said the causes had
been festering for some time and only fear
of expulsion or other punishment had held
them in check previously.
At least eight students were expelled as
a result.
Chief among grievances raised in the after
math were claims of double jeopardy in stu
dent traffic court after municipal fines, cen
sorship of the university newspaper, not

enough representation in and ineffectiveness
of student government.
THERE WERE other complaints of bans
on coeds kissing dates goodnight in front of
the women’s dormitories and charges of “Ges
tapo-like” enforcement of the ban on beer
drinking, both on and off campus.
The general complaint was a lack of free
dom as Individuals.
The consensus blamed McDonald.

Referring to the drinking ban, McDonald
says, “The liquor policy here has been in
existence before I came here. It is almost a
tradition. It is spelled out fully in the stu
dent catalogue and acceptance of that rule
and others is a requirement of admission.”
BUT SOME students claim the rule is en
forced so rigidly that campus cruisers have
been known to stop student cars entering the
campus late at night and check the students’
breath for any sign of alcohol.
McDonald says he maintains a hands-off
policy toward the university newspaper in
reply to the charge of censorship.
“The only thing I have to do with the paper
is to provide the money. There never was
any censorship. The only suggestion I made
was that with the troubled situation in the
world today, it would be good to keep up with
international nows by printing it in the
paper.”
STUDENTS, however, say no editorials ap
pear that are critical of the administration.
“They won’t even have a letters to the editor
column because of what students might say
about the administration,” many freshmen
and seniors say.
But Don Brenner, a BG graduate, said
there never was any censorship of the paper
in his two years as its director. “It is not a

student newspaper, but a university newspa
per,” he said. “It tries to represent both
sides.”
But he admitted “We have been too over
cautious in the printing of controversial ma
terial.”
BRENNER SAID he expected some modi
fication of the paper’s policies by the jour
nalism activities committee, composed of stu
dents and faculty, which determines the
policy.

McDonald said he knew of no ban on coeds
kissing their dates goodnight in front of the
dorms. “The rules of conduct for the women
are set down by the Association of Women
Students. I have delegated that authority
completely to the AWS as did my predeces
sor.”

After the demonstrations, McDonald sent
letters to both parents and students. He re
stated his support of university rules al
though admitting “there can be no doubt that
Bowling Green’s regulations are different
from those of many other excellent institu
tions.” He said he studied the grievances and
“it was quite apparent to me that many of
these deserve careful consideration and do
indeed warrant attention and action.”
HE INDICATED any changes would be de
cided in consultations between the adminis
tration and the student council.
When the students left for Easter vacation
they hinted further demonstrations would
occur when they returned. They returned
without incident, however, and adopted a
watch and wait policy. Meanwhile, the ad
ministration’s investigation of the disturb
ances continues.
