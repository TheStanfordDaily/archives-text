# Sayler Can Provide ASSU Leadership
## 
### 
In his victory statement ASSU President-elect Bob Sayler has
interpreted his smashing victory in the correctest sense: "I feel
that this election is not the end, but the beginning."
The voters, by giving Mr. Sayler a landslide margin of almost
1,000 ballots, have given him a mandate to carry out his large-scale
revampment and renovation of Stanford student government. Such
action is long overdue.
Mr. Sayler has outlined this action in his often stated "21 points."
Most important of these are his special investigatory commission to
define clearly the standards of the judicial authority on campus in
relation to the Men's and Women's Councils; his drive to establish
permanent hostel facilities; his reinvigoration of the President's Ad
visory Commission for Academic Affairs to give student opinion
on curriculum changes. Happily too, Mr. Sayler has said that he
will adopt a freshman orientation program to better integrate the
freshmen into the mainstream of student University life. From his
program the president-elect has made clear that he regards the
presidential power and Legislature as a starting point, not an end
ing point for legislation and reform. All of his platform points add
up to a commitment to catch up with the new birth of serious stu
dent interest which has its outcroppings in the Political Union's
Focus programs, the freshman discussion group on the Fundamen
tal Standard, and lastly, in one of the hardest fought election cam
paigns in Stanford history.
This is an ambitious program and many on campus have tended
to regard all of this platform as a conglomeration of campaign ora
tory and nothing more. These critics believe Mr. Sayler will be a
do-nothing president. Such dissenters have not observed either his
Kennedy-like drive or his catching enthusiasm. If he is able to per
suade enough of the first figures of the campus to join his six-man
braintrust, instead of some campus periphery organization, he
should be able to accomplish the mountainous program he has
outlined for his administration.
