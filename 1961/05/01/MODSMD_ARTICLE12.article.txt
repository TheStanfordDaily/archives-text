Fresh Thinking
Who are these pathetic people
who deign to designate them
selves young Americans for free
dom?
We have tired of the bundle of
social cliches being produced by
the “Berkleyan” lunatic fringe
who call themselves liberals. And
so we sought at least an articu
lated viewpoint indicating a mo
dicum of awareness of the current
issues in American life. To this
end, we recently checked into the
first meeting of the Young Ameri
cans for Freedom only to find, to
our dismay, a stultifying assem
blage of intellectual rabble. We
expected to find those people ca
pable of defending the American
ideals from the assault of totali
tarianism. Instead, we found the
witless, the inept, the misdirected,
and the misinformed. The posi
tive elements of their program en
tail picketing pickoters and turn
ing out a I’ooting section for the
H.U.A.C.
Gentlemen, the left has not of
fered us the new ideas, the fresh
thinking that our times demand.
Young Americans for Freedom,
can you? We fear not.

Right to Choose
HELP—MONSTER! ! What un
known power hath the Election
Commission chairwoman, that she
try to swing an election by
uniquely interpreting rules, and
by forbidding polls at certain
places of concentrated living?
It should be the duty of Elec
tions Commission to gather votes
fairly—NOT swing elections.
I issue a call to strike down this
monster, strip her of power, and
pickle her in formaldehyde. The
right to choose still lies with the
people.

Before I once more sink into
the absymal depths of the aca- j
demic murk I’d like to make a few !
comments about my recent un- j
successful sojourn for a seat on j
Men’s Council.
First, I’d like to thank the
countless minions who supported
me so faithfully, even to the bit-1
ter end. I might say that I was j
rather disconcerted at the slight
interest that my candidacy first
stirred. I was quite gratified later, |
however, by the tremendous wave j
of indifference swept up by my j
campaign. In truth, a few people
did work pretty hard (and ef-1
fectively as evidenced by the nar
row outcome) and I sincerely ap
preciate it.
Secondly, I’d like to rail at the
Daily’s editing of campaign state
ments, mine being a case in point. |
I must admit that my statement
may have been longer than the
prescribed limit, but I don’t think
this justified its being turned into
a travesty of the original by one
of the blue pencil-weilding, micro
cephalic members of your staff.
Had this incompetent merely re
versed his word-hacking, i.e.,
printed what he deleted instead of
the column as it appeared in The
Dally, I think the result would
have been a more valid represen
tation of what I had to say. Lest
this seem like “sour grapes’ I
hasten to add that I’m sure that [
your burlesquing my statement
was insignificant in the election’s
outcome. After all who reads The
Daily? It’s just that I don’t par
ticularly like to appear like a
fatuous ass, and who can’t spell
at that, e.g., your interesting sub
stitution of “sore of correlation”
for my phrase “sort of correla
tion.”

Lastly, I congratulate those per
spicuous students who managed
to get an inkling of what I was
driving at. Should they have
voted for mo I compliment them
on their discerning choice. I con
sole them for their candidate’s
loss with the thought that you
can’t keep a good man down . . .
