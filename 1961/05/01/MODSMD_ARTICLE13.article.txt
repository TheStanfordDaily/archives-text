## Armed Commitments in Laos, Cuba Would Be Disastrous for U.S. 
### 
On Thursday, the day before the
insurrection, the position of Gaul
list government was that for
France the Algerian question is
decided. The remaining problem

iwas when the Al
gerian National
ists would find
enough unity
among them
selves to assume
the powers that
would follow the
inde p en d e nee
which France
had decided to
grant them. On
Friday the Gen

erals rebelled, and almost cer
tainly the government in Paris
had little or no advance notice.
For seventy-two hours it was a
question whether the government
of Gen. de Gaulle had misjudged
its power.
During Saturday and Sunday
the rebellion had spread widely in
Algeria and by Sunday evening,
when Gen. de Gaulle spoke to the
nation, the mood in Paris was des
perate. One Cabinet Minister, for
example, was saying privately
that Paris was defenseless against
the paratroopers, that neither the
Army, nor the Air Force, nor the
Secret Service, nor the Police
could be relied upon to defend the
government. Only the Navy was
reliable. Sunday night in' Paris
was an anxious time, what with
the reports that paratroopers
were already in their planes and
would be dropping on Paris be
tween 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. M. De
bre. the Premier, had told the
French people that when they
heard the sirens announcing the
invasion, they should take then
cars and drive to the airports and
argue with the paratroopers! This
was a measure of how desperate
w-as the mood.

N EVERT HE LESS, during (hat
Sunday night the situation
changed radically. For reasons
which are not clear as yet, but can
perhaps be inferred, the para
troopers did not start for Paris,
or they were recalled. From then
on the insurrection began to fail.
Earlier that day I had heard Am
bassador Gavin say that nobody
could judge the situation until he
knew whether there was a strike
against Paris.

The big reason, I believe, why
the attack on Paris failed is that
the pessimists around Gen. de
Gaulle had underestimated his
personal power and resourceful
ness. When he had said on Thurs
day that for France the Algerian
question was decided, he was
speaking with the certainty that
while the dissidents in the armed
forces were strong men. the Gaul
list measures during the past year
or so had succeeded far more than
most people realized, in weaken
ing and breaking up the solidarity
of the rebellious officers.
The second reason, and no
doubt a smaller one—though I do
not know this for certain—was
that President Kennedy, acting on
the advice of Gen. Gavin—who is
a mighty good man in a crisis like
this one had rallied to Gen. do
Gaulle, had offered him help if it
were desired. The American pres-

ence in the Mediterranean of the
air forces of the Sixth Fleet,
w-hich were quite capable of inter
cepting an invasion, may have
done something to dissuade the
rebels from taking off for Paris.
It was wndely remembered in Pa
ris on Sunday night, and perhaps
also in Algeria, that on a previous
occasion when the paratroopers
were threatening Paris President
Eisenhower had rallied to Gen. de
Gaulle with an offer of American
help.
1 REPEAT that I cannot prove
this but I believe that the Ameri
can presence in the Mediterranean
was a factor, and that Ambassa
dor Gavin’s visit to Gen. de Gaulle
late Sunday evening marked an
American decision in which we
can take a certain quiet satisfac
tion.

We must not, how'ever, go over
hoard. A settlement in Algeria is
exceedingly difficult. For no
where in the world has any im
perial power succeeded in creat
ing a workable bi racial independ

ent state. The British, with all
their success in liquidating their
empire, have never succeeded in
doing this in their colonies where
there are two different religious
and racial communities. This

problem of the dual communities
extends from French Algeria
down through to British Central
and Eastern Africa to South Af
rica. If Gen. de Gaulle can now
succeed in establishing an inde
pendent Algeria, he will be a pio
neer in international relations.
FOR US, bewildered and beset
by events in Laos, South Vietnam,
and Cuba, this French affair
should be a salutary reminder not
to lose our perspective in world
affairs. By that I mean that we
must continue to keep our pri
mary attention fixed on what is
central and crucial and not be
come divided, distracted, and en
gaged in the periphery.
Reading the clippings after be
ing away for a month, I am as
tonished at the number of respon
sible men who want to use the
Marines and the American para
troopers all over the world. They
want to use them in Laos, in Viet-

nam, and Cuba. In my view, they
have lot their pride, their frustra
tion, and their impatience exag
gerate fantastically the impor
tance of these small peripheral
countries. This exaggeration is at
the expense of a clear and steady
and resolute view of the strategy
of our great adversary.
I cannot imagine any course of
action better calculated to lose
the cold war than to become en
gaged in the jungles of Indo-China
or in an occupation against the
guerrilla forces of Castro. Let us
never forget that the armed
forces of the Soviet Union are not
committed in any of these periph
eral countries. It is our para
mount duty in (he strategy of the
cold war not to become committed
in costly little wars which cannot
be won easily, if they can be won
at all, while the Soviet Union and
China have their hands free.
HAVK the addicts of these little
wars stopped to think what a little
war in Indo-China would be like?
If not, let them study the British
experience in Malaya where it
took ten years and a very large
army to subdue these Chinese
guerrillas. Have they thought
what a little war in Cuba would
be like after the Marines had cap
tured Havana and a few cities
and had then to govern a revolu
tionary peasantry?
Our people have to fix it in
their minds that the worldwide
upheaval which has come to Laos
and to Vietnam and to Cuba,
which will probably come to Iran
and to certain countries in South
America, that this world-wide rev
olution cannot be stopped and set
tled by the United States Marines,
great fighters though they are.
American armed engagements

in Ihese peripheral countries, with
the Soviet Union’s power uncom
mitted, would he the height of
strategic folly. These peripheral
countries, including Cuba, cannot
pose a vital threat to the security
| of (ho United States, and we must
not exaggerate their importance.
What is vitally important to the

future of the United States is the
central bastion of Western power.
This is what checks the central
power of the Soviet Union and
preserves the peace of the world
against a great war.. In this At
lantic bastion France is a key
country, as our actions in the past
few days have testified.

rebels from taking off for Paris.
It was wndely remembered in Pa
ris on Sunday night, and perhaps
also in Algeria, that on a previous
occasion when the paratroopers
were threatening Paris President
Eisenhower had rallied to Gen. de
Gaulle with an offer of American
help.
1 REPEAT that I cannot prove
this but I believe that the Ameri
can presence in the Mediterranean
was a factor, and that Ambassa
dor Gavin’s visit to Gen. de Gaulle
late Sunday evening marked an
American decision in which we
can take a certain quiet satisfac
tion.

We must not, how'ever, go over
hoard. A settlement in Algeria is
exceedingly difficult. For no
where in the world has any im
perial power succeeded in creat
ing a workable bi racial independ

ent state. The British, with all
their success in liquidating their
empire, have never succeeded in
doing this in their colonies where
there are two different religious
and racial communities. This

problem of the dual communities
extends from French Algeria
down through to British Central
and Eastern Africa to South Af
rica. If Gen. de Gaulle can now
succeed in establishing an inde
pendent Algeria, he will be a pio
neer in international relations.
FOR US, bewildered and beset
by events in Laos, South Vietnam,
and Cuba, this French affair
should be a salutary reminder not
to lose our perspective in world
affairs. By that I mean that we
must continue to keep our pri
mary attention fixed on what is
central and crucial and not be
come divided, distracted, and en
gaged in the periphery.
Reading the clippings after be
ing away for a month, I am as
tonished at the number of respon
sible men who want to use the
Marines and the American para
troopers all over the world. They
want to use them in Laos, in Viet-

nam, and Cuba. In my view, they
have lot their pride, their frustra
tion, and their impatience exag
gerate fantastically the impor
tance of these small peripheral
countries. This exaggeration is at
the expense of a clear and steady
and resolute view of the strategy
of our great adversary.
I cannot imagine any course of
action better calculated to lose
the cold war than to become en
gaged in the jungles of Indo-China
or in an occupation against the
guerrilla forces of Castro. Let us
never forget that the armed
forces of the Soviet Union are not
committed in any of these periph
eral countries. It is our para
mount duty in (he strategy of the
cold war not to become committed
in costly little wars which cannot
be won easily, if they can be won
at all, while the Soviet Union and
China have their hands free.
HAVK the addicts of these little
wars stopped to think what a little
war in Indo-China would be like?
If not, let them study the British
experience in Malaya where it
took ten years and a very large
army to subdue these Chinese
guerrillas. Have they thought
what a little war in Cuba would
be like after the Marines had cap
tured Havana and a few cities
and had then to govern a revolu
tionary peasantry?
Our people have to fix it in
their minds that the worldwide
upheaval which has come to Laos
and to Vietnam and to Cuba,
which will probably come to Iran
and to certain countries in South
America, that this world-wide rev
olution cannot be stopped and set
tled by the United States Marines,
great fighters though they are.
American armed engagements

in Ihese peripheral countries, with
the Soviet Union’s power uncom
mitted, would he the height of
strategic folly. These peripheral
countries, including Cuba, cannot
pose a vital threat to the security
| of (ho United States, and we must
not exaggerate their importance.
What is vitally important to the

future of the United States is the
central bastion of Western power.
This is what checks the central
power of the Soviet Union and
preserves the peace of the world
against a great war.. In this At
lantic bastion France is a key
country, as our actions in the past
few days have testified.

On Thursday, the day before the
insurrection, the position of Gaul
list government was that for
France the Algerian question is
decided. The remaining problem

iwas when the Al
gerian National
ists would find
enough unity
among them
selves to assume
the powers that
would follow the
inde p en d e nee
which France
had decided to
grant them. On
Friday the Gen

erals rebelled, and almost cer
tainly the government in Paris
had little or no advance notice.
For seventy-two hours it was a
question whether the government
of Gen. de Gaulle had misjudged
its power.
During Saturday and Sunday
the rebellion had spread widely in
Algeria and by Sunday evening,
when Gen. de Gaulle spoke to the
nation, the mood in Paris was des
perate. One Cabinet Minister, for
example, was saying privately
that Paris was defenseless against
the paratroopers, that neither the
Army, nor the Air Force, nor the
Secret Service, nor the Police
could be relied upon to defend the
government. Only the Navy was
reliable. Sunday night in' Paris
was an anxious time, what with
the reports that paratroopers
were already in their planes and
would be dropping on Paris be
tween 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. M. De
bre. the Premier, had told the
French people that when they
heard the sirens announcing the
invasion, they should take then
cars and drive to the airports and
argue with the paratroopers! This
was a measure of how desperate
w-as the mood.

N EVERT HE LESS, during (hat
Sunday night the situation
changed radically. For reasons
which are not clear as yet, but can
perhaps be inferred, the para
troopers did not start for Paris,
or they were recalled. From then
on the insurrection began to fail.
Earlier that day I had heard Am
bassador Gavin say that nobody
could judge the situation until he
knew whether there was a strike
against Paris.

The big reason, I believe, why
the attack on Paris failed is that
the pessimists around Gen. de
Gaulle had underestimated his
personal power and resourceful
ness. When he had said on Thurs
day that for France the Algerian
question was decided, he was
speaking with the certainty that
while the dissidents in the armed
forces were strong men. the Gaul
list measures during the past year
or so had succeeded far more than
most people realized, in weaken
ing and breaking up the solidarity
of the rebellious officers.
The second reason, and no
doubt a smaller one—though I do
not know this for certain—was
that President Kennedy, acting on
the advice of Gen. Gavin—who is
a mighty good man in a crisis like
this one had rallied to Gen. do
Gaulle, had offered him help if it
were desired. The American pres-

ence in the Mediterranean of the
air forces of the Sixth Fleet,
w-hich were quite capable of inter
cepting an invasion, may have
done something to dissuade the
rebels from taking off for Paris.

On Thursday, the day before the
insurrection, the position of Gaul
list government was that for
France the Algerian question is
decided. The remaining problem

iwas when the Al
gerian National
ists would find
enough unity
among them
selves to assume
the powers that
would follow the
inde p en d e nee
which France
had decided to
grant them. On
Friday the Gen

erals rebelled, and almost cer
tainly the government in Paris
had little or no advance notice.
For seventy-two hours it was a
question whether the government
of Gen. de Gaulle had misjudged
its power.
During Saturday and Sunday
the rebellion had spread widely in
Algeria and by Sunday evening,
when Gen. de Gaulle spoke to the
nation, the mood in Paris was des
perate. One Cabinet Minister, for
example, was saying privately
that Paris was defenseless against
the paratroopers, that neither the
Army, nor the Air Force, nor the
Secret Service, nor the Police
could be relied upon to defend the
government. Only the Navy was
reliable. Sunday night in' Paris
was an anxious time, what with
the reports that paratroopers
were already in their planes and
would be dropping on Paris be
tween 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. M. De
bre. the Premier, had told the
French people that when they
heard the sirens announcing the
invasion, they should take then
cars and drive to the airports and
argue with the paratroopers! This
was a measure of how desperate
w-as the mood.

N EVERT HE LESS, during (hat
Sunday night the situation
changed radically. For reasons
which are not clear as yet, but can
perhaps be inferred, the para
troopers did not start for Paris,
or they were recalled. From then
on the insurrection began to fail.
Earlier that day I had heard Am
bassador Gavin say that nobody
could judge the situation until he
knew whether there was a strike
against Paris.

The big reason, I believe, why
the attack on Paris failed is that
the pessimists around Gen. de
Gaulle had underestimated his
personal power and resourceful
ness. When he had said on Thurs
day that for France the Algerian
question was decided, he was
speaking with the certainty that
while the dissidents in the armed
forces were strong men. the Gaul
list measures during the past year
or so had succeeded far more than
most people realized, in weaken
ing and breaking up the solidarity
of the rebellious officers.
The second reason, and no
doubt a smaller one—though I do
not know this for certain—was
that President Kennedy, acting on
the advice of Gen. Gavin—who is
a mighty good man in a crisis like
this one had rallied to Gen. do
Gaulle, had offered him help if it
were desired. The American pres-

ence in the Mediterranean of the
air forces of the Sixth Fleet,
w-hich were quite capable of inter
cepting an invasion, may have
done something to dissuade the
rebels from taking off for Paris.
It was wndely remembered in Pa
ris on Sunday night, and perhaps
also in Algeria, that on a previous
occasion when the paratroopers
were threatening Paris President
Eisenhower had rallied to Gen. de
Gaulle with an offer of American
help.
1 REPEAT that I cannot prove
this but I believe that the Ameri
can presence in the Mediterranean
was a factor, and that Ambassa
dor Gavin’s visit to Gen. de Gaulle
late Sunday evening marked an
American decision in which we
can take a certain quiet satisfac
tion.

We must not, how'ever, go over
hoard. A settlement in Algeria is
exceedingly difficult. For no
where in the world has any im
perial power succeeded in creat
ing a workable bi racial independ

ent state. The British, with all
their success in liquidating their
empire, have never succeeded in
doing this in their colonies where
there are two different religious
and racial communities. This

problem of the dual communities
extends from French Algeria
down through to British Central
and Eastern Africa to South Af
rica. If Gen. de Gaulle can now
succeed in establishing an inde
pendent Algeria, he will be a pio
neer in international relations.
FOR US, bewildered and beset
by events in Laos, South Vietnam,
and Cuba, this French affair
should be a salutary reminder not
to lose our perspective in world
affairs. By that I mean that we
must continue to keep our pri
mary attention fixed on what is
central and crucial and not be
come divided, distracted, and en
gaged in the periphery.
Reading the clippings after be
ing away for a month, I am as
tonished at the number of respon
sible men who want to use the
Marines and the American para
troopers all over the world. They
want to use them in Laos, in Viet-

nam, and Cuba. In my view, they
have lot their pride, their frustra
tion, and their impatience exag
gerate fantastically the impor
tance of these small peripheral
countries. This exaggeration is at
the expense of a clear and steady
and resolute view of the strategy
of our great adversary.
I cannot imagine any course of
action better calculated to lose
the cold war than to become en
gaged in the jungles of Indo-China
or in an occupation against the
guerrilla forces of Castro. Let us
never forget that the armed
forces of the Soviet Union are not
committed in any of these periph
eral countries. It is our para
mount duty in (he strategy of the
cold war not to become committed
in costly little wars which cannot
be won easily, if they can be won
at all, while the Soviet Union and
China have their hands free.
HAVK the addicts of these little
wars stopped to think what a little
war in Indo-China would be like?
If not, let them study the British
experience in Malaya where it
took ten years and a very large
army to subdue these Chinese
guerrillas. Have they thought
what a little war in Cuba would
be like after the Marines had cap
tured Havana and a few cities
and had then to govern a revolu
tionary peasantry?
Our people have to fix it in
their minds that the worldwide
upheaval which has come to Laos

The big reason, I believe, why
the attack on Paris failed is that
the pessimists around Gen. de
Gaulle had underestimated his
personal power and resourceful
ness. When he had said on Thurs
day that for France the Algerian
question was decided, he was
speaking with the certainty that
while the dissidents in the armed
forces were strong men. the Gaul
list measures during the past year
or so had succeeded far more than
most people realized, in weaken
ing and breaking up the solidarity
of the rebellious officers.
The second reason, and no
doubt a smaller one—though I do
not know this for certain—was
that President Kennedy, acting on
the advice of Gen. Gavin—who is
a mighty good man in a crisis like
this one had rallied to Gen. do
Gaulle, had offered him help if it
were desired. The American pres-

ence in the Mediterranean of the
air forces of the Sixth Fleet,
w-hich were quite capable of inter
cepting an invasion, may have
done something to dissuade the
rebels from taking off for Paris.
It was wndely remembered in Pa
ris on Sunday night, and perhaps
also in Algeria, that on a previous
occasion when the paratroopers
were threatening Paris President
Eisenhower had rallied to Gen. de
Gaulle with an offer of American
help.
1 REPEAT that I cannot prove
this but I believe that the Ameri
can presence in the Mediterranean
was a factor, and that Ambassa
dor Gavin’s visit to Gen. de Gaulle
late Sunday evening marked an
American decision in which we
can take a certain quiet satisfac
tion.

We must not, how'ever, go over
hoard. A settlement in Algeria is
exceedingly difficult. For no
where in the world has any im
perial power succeeded in creat
ing a workable bi racial independ

ent state. The British, with all
their success in liquidating their
empire, have never succeeded in
doing this in their colonies where
there are two different religious
and racial communities. This

problem of the dual communities
extends from French Algeria
down through to British Central
and Eastern Africa to South Af
rica. If Gen. de Gaulle can now
succeed in establishing an inde
pendent Algeria, he will be a pio
neer in international relations.
FOR US, bewildered and beset
by events in Laos, South Vietnam,
and Cuba, this French affair
should be a salutary reminder not
to lose our perspective in world
affairs. By that I mean that we
must continue to keep our pri
mary attention fixed on what is
central and crucial and not be
come divided, distracted, and en
gaged in the periphery.
Reading the clippings after be
ing away for a month, I am as
tonished at the number of respon
sible men who want to use the
Marines and the American para
troopers all over the world. They
want to use them in Laos, in Viet-

nam, and Cuba. In my view, they
have lot their pride, their frustra
tion, and their impatience exag
gerate fantastically the impor
tance of these small peripheral
countries. This exaggeration is at
the expense of a clear and steady
and resolute view of the strategy
of our great adversary.
I cannot imagine any course of
action better calculated to lose
the cold war than to become en
gaged in the jungles of Indo-China
or in an occupation against the
guerrilla forces of Castro. Let us
never forget that the armed
forces of the Soviet Union are not
committed in any of these periph
eral countries. It is our para
mount duty in (he strategy of the
cold war not to become committed
in costly little wars which cannot
be won easily, if they can be won
at all, while the Soviet Union and
China have their hands free.
HAVK the addicts of these little
wars stopped to think what a little
war in Indo-China would be like?
If not, let them study the British
experience in Malaya where it
took ten years and a very large
army to subdue these Chinese
guerrillas. Have they thought
what a little war in Cuba would
be like after the Marines had cap
tured Havana and a few cities
and had then to govern a revolu
tionary peasantry?
Our people have to fix it in
their minds that the worldwide
upheaval which has come to Laos
and to Vietnam and to Cuba,
which will probably come to Iran
and to certain countries in South
America, that this world-wide rev
olution cannot be stopped and set
tled by the United States Marines,
great fighters though they are.
American armed engagements

in Ihese peripheral countries, with
the Soviet Union’s power uncom
mitted, would he the height of
strategic folly. These peripheral
countries, including Cuba, cannot
pose a vital threat to the security
| of (ho United States, and we must
not exaggerate their importance.
What is vitally important to the

future of the United States is the
central bastion of Western power.
This is what checks the central
power of the Soviet Union and
preserves the peace of the world
against a great war.. In this At
lantic bastion France is a key
country, as our actions in the past
few days have testified.

On Thursday, the day before the
insurrection, the position of Gaul
list government was that for
France the Algerian question is
decided. The remaining problem

iwas when the Al
gerian National
ists would find
enough unity
among them
selves to assume
the powers that
would follow the
inde p en d e nee
which France
had decided to
grant them. On
Friday the Gen

erals rebelled, and almost cer
tainly the government in Paris
had little or no advance notice.
For seventy-two hours it was a
question whether the government
of Gen. de Gaulle had misjudged
its power.
During Saturday and Sunday
the rebellion had spread widely in
Algeria and by Sunday evening,
when Gen. de Gaulle spoke to the
nation, the mood in Paris was des
perate. One Cabinet Minister, for
example, was saying privately
that Paris was defenseless against
the paratroopers, that neither the
Army, nor the Air Force, nor the
Secret Service, nor the Police
could be relied upon to defend the
government. Only the Navy was
reliable. Sunday night in' Paris
was an anxious time, what with
the reports that paratroopers
were already in their planes and
would be dropping on Paris be
tween 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. M. De
bre. the Premier, had told the
French people that when they
heard the sirens announcing the
invasion, they should take then
cars and drive to the airports and
argue with the paratroopers! This
was a measure of how desperate
w-as the mood.

N EVERT HE LESS, during (hat
Sunday night the situation
changed radically. For reasons
which are not clear as yet, but can
perhaps be inferred, the para
troopers did not start for Paris,
or they were recalled. From then
on the insurrection began to fail.
Earlier that day I had heard Am
bassador Gavin say that nobody
could judge the situation until he
knew whether there was a strike
against Paris.

The big reason, I believe, why
the attack on Paris failed is that
the pessimists around Gen. de
Gaulle had underestimated his
personal power and resourceful
ness. When he had said on Thurs
