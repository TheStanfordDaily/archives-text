# Survey Shows Fewer Jobs for June Graduates
## 
### 
MINNEAPOLIS (UPI) June
college graduates will have jobs
waiting for them if they are sci
entists, engineers, accountants, or
teachers, according to a report of
the Northwestern National Life
Insurance Co., which has just re
ceived the preliminary returns of
its 26th annual survey on college
employment.
PROSPECTS for business and
liberal arts graduates also look
bright, but they cannot be accu
rately appraised yet, the report
said. It was explained that many
employers have been delaying de
laying decisions on how many
new personnel they will hire un
til they can judge the vigor of the
current business upswing. They
expect it to take definite shape
within the next 30 or 60 days.
The University of California at
Los Angelos reported that more
small companies were interview
ing. especially in the electronics
field, than had last year. The
university said the actual number
of job offers were slightly fewer
than at this time last spring, due
mainly to greater selectivity, but
that overall prospects for the
June class were good.
IT WAS NOTED that there was
a continued demand for Ph.D.’s
and masters in anthropology, and
in other social sciences.
University of Pennsylvania said
it was “operating at our capacity
limit" of 500 recruiting compa
nies, but not averaging as many
jobs per company. Engineering
demand was reported equal to
last year and as many or more
jobs were being offered by gen
eral business.
