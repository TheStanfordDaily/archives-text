## 
### 
Stanford varsity, JV and fresh
man crews had a black Saturday
as all three lost to the California
Bear shells in the annual Big Re
gatta on the Oakland Estuary.
Cal’s varsity, breaking the way

through sweeping rains, jumped
off to an early load in the 2,000
meter race, and led by three
fourths of a length at the 600 !
meter pole. Gliding smoothly, the
Bear shell slowly pulled away and
won by two and one-half lengths
with a time of 5:54,
Stanford, suffering its first loss
of the year against three wins,
had a clocking of 6:02.
The Bear JV’s gave their Card
opponents a little of the same as
they moved out to a two and one
half length lead and held it to
the finish in a time of 6:05.5.
The freshman race was a run
away as the Cubs gained a full
four lengths on the Papooses and
finished in a torid 6:03.6. The
Stanford aggregate moved under
the line in 6:17.1.
/For the California varsity it
was their fourth win in as many
starts. They boast wins over USC,
UCLA and Long Beach State. The
first shell included four veterans
of Cal’s 1960 IRA champions.
Cal Coach Jim Lemmon’s week
end was complete, for on Friday j
his third varsity and second and
third frosh crews also triumphed I
over Stanford.
