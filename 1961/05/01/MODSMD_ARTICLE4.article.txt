### ILENE STRELITZ 
It was the eve of the Junior Prom—dream of the freshman women,
big night for the junior class. At Bay Meadows, summer formals
and pressed suits entered in happy couples. Shelley Berman and
Ray Hackett for just six dollars was too good to miss.
But Shelley Berman wasn't there.

And Ray Hackett wasn’t there.
But a radio was. and a Theta
Chi trio, and two hundred couples
in a hall that had cost $750 to rent.
So the couples that didn't leave
to catch Mort Sahl and the hun
gry i stayed and had a sock hop.
ACCORDING to Junior Class
President Jim Shekoyan, Berman
had been cancelled Thursday
night due to lack of ticket sales.
“People just weren’t interested,
perhaps due to this quarter’s lack
of interest in big dances.”
At least for Berman, the junior
class knew what had happened.
But being adaptable, they waited
for Hackett. Hackett in the mean
time played up a storm for a Cal
fraternity, never suspecting that
his booking agency had complete
ly crossed up his engagements.
AS OF LAST night, Shekoyan
and Junior Class Vice-President
Joan Cowell promised a full re
fund to all. With a $235 deposit
for Hackett still outstanding on
the budget as well as the $750
rental of Bay Meadows, Shekoyan
promises an interesting meeting
between Hackett’s booking ag
ency. junior class officers and a
Stanford Dean.
But there is one consolation to
the promless juniors.
