“Good, clean fun, my feather,”
said a mud caked pompon girl,
cheerfully. “It was a riot.”
Mud Follies were fully under
' way during the Arroyo-Cedro
| kickball game according to Chair
man Leo Stephenson’s plans, but
then more people started getting
into the act. The frosh natives
were restless.
After winning a tug-of-war
across one of the knee-deep mud
ponds, Arroyo men charged the
spectators. A trail of soaking
frosh dollies marked their ram-
{ page. Pompon girls wallowed in
i muddy troughs and slid on hands
: and knees through the crowds.
Minor injuries in the day’s
I events included Robert Blum, An
-1 son Garnsey, Carey Kelly, Mary
I Lockwood, Fred Phillips, and Suzy
j Webb. The muddied victims were
i treated for minor cuts and bruises
j and released.
Said one smiling frosh dollie,
“Can we do this next week too?”
Then she vanished in a new bar
rage of mud and frogs.
