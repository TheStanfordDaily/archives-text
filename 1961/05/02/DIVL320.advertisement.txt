A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME
As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone’s
lips is: “How did the different disciplines come to be marked by
academic robes with hoods of different colors?” Everybody—
but everybody— is asking it. I mean I haven’t been able to walk
ten feet on any campus in America without somebody grabs my
elbow and says, “How did the different disciplines come to be
marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?”
This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by collegians
who grab my elbow'. Usually they say, “Hey, Shorty, got a
Marlboro?” And this is right and proper. After all, are they not
collegians, and, therefore, the nation's leaders in intelligence
and discernment? And do not intelligence and discernment de
mand the tastiest in tobacco flavor and smoking pleasure? And
docs not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely mellow, a
selectrate filter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box
that is hard? You know it!

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes,
A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears
green, a master of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities wears
crimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow, Why?
Why, for example, should a master of library science wear lemon
yellow?
Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the
United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful—all, that
Is, except Wrex Todhunter.
Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise
Mambo, the Shay’s Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.
Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all
owing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.
(He was struck by a falling praline.)
Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’s
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
This lie did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.
Sigafoos. “What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven’t got?” Mr.
Todhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to
him: books.
So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books
and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
But Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There
upon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea
with sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with
sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving
tea with sugar and cream and lemon.
This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be
cause he had the only lemon tree in town —in fact, in the entire
state of North Dakota—and since that day lemon yellow has of
course been the color on the academic robes of library science.
(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library
and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There
were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,
alas, there wits no cream because the cow was not introduced
to California until 1931 by John Wayne.) isai shuiman

A ROBE BY ANY OTHER NAME
As Commencement Day draws near, the question on everyone’s
lips is: “How did the different disciplines come to be marked by
academic robes with hoods of different colors?” Everybody—
but everybody— is asking it. I mean I haven’t been able to walk
ten feet on any campus in America without somebody grabs my
elbow and says, “How did the different disciplines come to be
marked by academic robes with hoods of different colors, hey?”
This, I must say, is not the usual question asked by collegians
who grab my elbow'. Usually they say, “Hey, Shorty, got a
Marlboro?” And this is right and proper. After all, are they not
collegians, and, therefore, the nation's leaders in intelligence
and discernment? And do not intelligence and discernment de
mand the tastiest in tobacco flavor and smoking pleasure? And
docs not Marlboro deliver a flavor that is uniquely mellow, a
selectrate filter that is easy drawing, a pack that is soft, a box
that is hard? You know it!

But I digress. Back to the colored hoods of academic robes,
A doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears
green, a master of arts wears white, a doctor of humanities wears
crimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow, Why?
Why, for example, should a master of library science wear lemon
yellow?
Well sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to
March 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the
United States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.
Sigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful—all, that
Is, except Wrex Todhunter.
Mr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since 1822 when both
men had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had
chosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.
Sigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise
Mambo, the Shay’s Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.
Polk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all
owing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.
(He was struck by a falling praline.)
Consumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos’s
library, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.
This lie did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.
Sigafoos. “What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven’t got?” Mr.
Todhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to
him: books.
So Mr. Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books
and soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.
But Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began
serving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. There
upon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea
with sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with
sugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter began serving
tea with sugar and cream and lemon.
This, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. Todhunter be
cause he had the only lemon tree in town —in fact, in the entire
state of North Dakota—and since that day lemon yellow has of
course been the color on the academic robes of library science.
(Incidentally, the defeated Mr. Sigafoos packed up his library
and moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There
were, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,
alas, there wits no cream because the cow was not introduced
to California until 1931 by John Wayne.) isai shuiman
