# Vote Fraud Sign Of Moral Failure
## 
### 
The revelation of the vote frauding in last fall's student body
election is only one of the signs of a breakdown of moral discipline
in our college community and perhaps our nation.
The three suspended students, one of them recently elected to
one of the highest posts in the school, are products of this crumbling
morality. But this does not excuse them. The facts from Men's Coun
cil make clear that the two knew exactly what they were doing as
they illegally marked the ballots. The third party watched and did
nothing and he must be judged guilty, too. What compounds their
errors was their official position and their offense. These people cer
tainly must have realized the black-and-white seriousness of their
crime. It is not like the question of unwittingly drinking too much
at a party and later getting caught. There is no grey in-between in
marking ballots. The trio, too, relinquished the public trust which
makes their error all the more grave, not only to the student body
but also to themselves. These men could have perverted the people's
will by electing a candidate the majority had not chosen. Only luck
prevented this from happening.

The three have also lost much of the confidence individual stu
dents might have personally placed in their words and actions. As
the Roman satirist Phaedrus once said, "Whoever has even once be
come notorious by base fraud, even if he speaks the truth, gains no
belief." It is doubtful that the one who ran successfully for office
would have been elected if his part in this fraud had been revealed
beforehand and now certainly this person's effectiveness next year
will be impaired.

Their identities are known to a good percentage of the student
body; their names have not been published for it would only further
their humiliation on campus and in newspapers across the country.
We do not expect the campus to be overly alarmed at all this
nonsense, for the campus has not seemed overly alarmed about the
stealing of furniture from one living group by another living group.
It may be termed burglary in the outside world, but here it is only
a college prank. Before a reaction set in, the campus did not seem
concerned about the acts of obscene behavior before the freshman
women by the freshman men—although apologies flowed afterward.
And, too, the lies and smears of the last student election campaign
reminded us more of a Tammany Hall dogfight than a hard-fought
but clean campus election campaign.
We can not place too much blame on the students, for the nation
was seemingly unconcerned as a scholar, Charles Van Doren, prosti
tuted himself for the sake of easy quiz show money or watched as
disc jockeys fold of their payola money. Perhaps because the price
riggers of the electric companies were not "nice guys" the public ire
was slightly aroused.

What is needed now on this campus is a restoration of honesty
and integrity as group-accepted virtues rather than the "so-what-if
he's-a-little-dishonest—he's-a-nice-guy" attitude which prevails. This
restoration might reverse the sloppy morality which we of the post
war generation have bred.

nothing and he must be judged guilty, too. What compounds their
errors was their official position and their offense. These people cer
tainly must have realized the black-and-white seriousness of their
crime. It is not like the question of unwittingly drinking too much
at a party and later getting caught. There is no grey in-between in
marking ballots. The trio, too, relinquished the public trust which
makes their error all the more grave, not only to the student body
but also to themselves. These men could have perverted the people's
will by electing a candidate the majority had not chosen. Only luck
prevented this from happening.

The three have also lost much of the confidence individual stu
dents might have personally placed in their words and actions. As
the Roman satirist Phaedrus once said, "Whoever has even once be
come notorious by base fraud, even if he speaks the truth, gains no
belief." It is doubtful that the one who ran successfully for office
would have been elected if his part in this fraud had been revealed
beforehand and now certainly this person's effectiveness next year
will be impaired.

Their identities are known to a good percentage of the student
body; their names have not been published for it would only further
their humiliation on campus and in newspapers across the country.
We do not expect the campus to be overly alarmed at all this
nonsense, for the campus has not seemed overly alarmed about the
stealing of furniture from one living group by another living group.
It may be termed burglary in the outside world, but here it is only
a college prank. Before a reaction set in, the campus did not seem
concerned about the acts of obscene behavior before the freshman
women by the freshman men—although apologies flowed afterward.
And, too, the lies and smears of the last student election campaign
reminded us more of a Tammany Hall dogfight than a hard-fought
but clean campus election campaign.
We can not place too much blame on the students, for the nation
was seemingly unconcerned as a scholar, Charles Van Doren, prosti
tuted himself for the sake of easy quiz show money or watched as
disc jockeys fold of their payola money. Perhaps because the price
riggers of the electric companies were not "nice guys" the public ire
was slightly aroused.

What is needed now on this campus is a restoration of honesty
and integrity as group-accepted virtues rather than the "so-what-if
he's-a-little-dishonest—he's-a-nice-guy" attitude which prevails. This
restoration might reverse the sloppy morality which we of the post
war generation have bred.
The revelation of the vote frauding in last fall's student body
election is only one of the signs of a breakdown of moral discipline
in our college community and perhaps our nation.
The three suspended students, one of them recently elected to
one of the highest posts in the school, are products of this crumbling
morality. But this does not excuse them. The facts from Men's Coun
cil make clear that the two knew exactly what they were doing as
they illegally marked the ballots. The third party watched and did
nothing and he must be judged guilty, too. What compounds their
errors was their official position and their offense. These people cer
tainly must have realized the black-and-white seriousness of their
