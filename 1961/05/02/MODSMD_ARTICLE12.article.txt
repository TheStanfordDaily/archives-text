# Con Home Asks Student Help
## 
### 
The Con Home Drive is fortunate this year in having a list of dis
tinguished Con Home king and queen candidates ranging from
Delta Chi's Mo The Mutt to El Capitan's Count Marco to serve as
an incentive for contributions. The competition so far is close, but no
matter what the outcome, the ultimate winner will be the Con Home.
The money couldn't go for a more worthy cause. The Stanford
Convalescence Home, a licensed medical hospital and rehabilitation
center that operates separately from the University, cares for 65
children who are recuperating from crippling diseases and other
illnesses.
Since it was founded 42 years ago, the Con Home has treated
more than 7000 children. The home had its beginning in 1919 when
a group of children from the Stanford Clinic in San Francisco came
down to the Farm for a summer of rest and sun. In 1921, the Con
Home moved into the old Stanford mansion, part of which is still
used today as a physical therapy center.
Six years ago, the Con Home expanded into a hospital and re
habilitation center as well as a place for children with non-communi
cable diseases like rhumatic fever and asthma. About 100 persons,
including physical therapists, full-time doctors, nurses, and social
workers, presently carry ont the work of the Con Home.
Children from two years old through their teens are admitted to
the home on the basis of individual needs, rather than their parents'
ability to pay. Funds for the operation of this non-profit organization
come then from endowments and contributions by private citizens
and organizations in the Stanford-Palo Alto area.

Through the years several people have made helping the Con
Home their personal hobby and project. Before his death, Sam Mc-
Donald tilled five acres of land and raised vegetables for the children.
Sam McDonald did his part. Now the Con Home is calling upon
the students to do theirs.
