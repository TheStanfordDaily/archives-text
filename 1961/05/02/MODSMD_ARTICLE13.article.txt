## Mort Sahl Slashes Kennedy 
### 
The post-election Mort Sahl is
an intriguing phenomenon. To
say that only the names have been
changed concerning the subject of
his humor wouldn't be right, re
ally, because his whole conception
seems to have changed with the
Democratic ascent to power.
Sahl treats Kennedy and his
family and friends with a bitter
ness and a sense of disillusion
ment that was never present dur
ing the Eisenhower-Nixon days.
It’s almost as if Sahl feels he
and “his people” were betrayed.
IN THE pre-Kennedy days you
never got the feeling that Sahl
was really mad at the rulers of
the country, even though his
avowed purpose was to overthrow
them. Eisenhower wasn’t a bad
or dangerous man really; just a
little stupid and in a situation he
couldn’t handle.

Even Nixon was never a subject
for the bitterness that Kennedy
has become. Nixon, to Sahl, was
shady and dangerous, but he did
n’t seem to provoke the same in
tensity of feeling that Kennedy
now does.

At any rate, Sahl, in his new
found vehemence for the people
that he was once supposed to be
representing, presents a different
side of his personality and a new
side of his humor. The effect,
however, is the same. He remains
incredibly funny.
HE RIJNS OUT onto the stage
of the hungry i, unrolls the usual
newspaper and lays it down, looks
nervously at the audience and de
mands, “Well, do you still think
he’s better than Nixon?’’

He mentions Kennedy’s confer
ences with Herbert Hoover and
Douglas Mac Arthur regarding
foreign policy. “I gather,’’ he
says, "that Hitler wasn’t avail
able.” The audience—which he
says gets more mature every year
—is in hysterics. It must have
been the nastiest thing anybody
there has ever heard him say in
public.
He says that Kennedy is addres
sing the nation on radio today
and will hold a press conference
Monday. “In the meantime, you
have your weekend to do with as
you see fit.”
ON TO OTHER members of
the official and unofficial family.
“Bobby Kennedy is now in charge
of the FBI and the CIA. Both of
fices have signs saying ‘Little
Brother Is Watching You.’ ”
"Frank Sinatra has received
certain political favors for his
campaign help. Like repeal of
the Mann Act.”
It’s almost wtih a sigh of relief
that he returns to more usual
topics.
But even with his one time fa
vorites in power, Sahl doesn’t look
ready for retirement. He still has
a government to overthrow.
