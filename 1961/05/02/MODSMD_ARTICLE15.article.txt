I should like to thank you for
your editorial of Friday, 28 April.
God forbid that anyone currently
reading the Daily should think
that you support us. I am grati
fied to see that, finally, we have
been subjected to your omnis
cient, informed criticism.
I doubt that we shall suffer
from it.
The timing of the Cuban pro
gram was excellent, wasn’t it?
But shouldn’t that be to our cred
it? And if, indeed, it was unfor
tunate that the Cuban invasion co
incided with the PACE kick-off,
one must admit that some of the
program's merit was that it did
have immediate relevance. I con
fess that we control neither PA
CE nor Cuban affairs.
If for once you had sent out a
reporter to gather information
more complete than that which
suits only you, then you might
have found yourself with news
more fit to print.
I Your reporter would have dis-
I covered that efforts were and are
[ being made to present a program
[ representing the "other side." We
| very much desire to present a
whose credentials equal
i those of Dr. Baran. But we cannot
1 control this aspect of the prob-
I lem, either. Moreover, it is diffi
! cult to find any informed citizen,
including the President, who will
defend U.S. involvement in the
Cuban fiasco. But we continue to
hope that such a person or per
sons will make themselves known.
Furthermore, the question of
balance is, in ways, an artificial
I one. Must every program, every
speech be balanced, quantitative
ly, by an opposing position at
every time and at every place? I
think not. But, if thi-s were to be
done, how could we insure a bal
ance in the quality of the speak
ers? We can’t. Nevertheless, we
do try for a general balance. Your
| reporter would have discovered
j this fact, too.
I Your reporter would have dis
[covered that, purposely, publicity
was kept to” a minimum; that
] many precautions had been taken

to insure an orderly meeting; and
that, in fact, the meeting was or
derly. Please save such words as
“rabid” for situations to which
they apply.
Your general commitment to
irres pon s i b1 e, sensationalistic
journalism will never win you
support. It reflects not on you
alone but on your staff, on the
student body, and, finally, on the
University. Please remember that.
JOEL MEISTER,
UR Vice President
