# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION

### Ken Dery 
While the football season is still a long way off (the trackmen
are still busy pulling muscles) small bits of information have already
started drifting to the sports desk.
“There’s nothing wrong that a little good weather wouldn’t cure,”
Coach Jim Owens said last week in appraising the first week of
spring football turnouts at the University of Washington.
UNSEASONABLY cold, wet weather has hampered the defending
Rose Bowl champions since they started working out two weeks ago.
The first week, which saw the Huskies get in but 5 of their 20 ses
sions. was spent mostly on briefing the newcomers who will try to
pick up the slack caused by graduation.

The men from Seattle were hit
hard in the diploma game late in
June, and there are only 11 re
turning lettermen among the 80
hopefuls who greeted the youth
ful Owens. Only one of these,
Jim Skaggs, was a starter on last
year’s Rose Bowl championship
eleven. Skaggs, a 6-2. 215-pound
junior, played right end last sea
son, but will he switched to guard
this year.
It’s one of several changes
planned by the Husky coaches.
Big John Meyers, 0-6, 2-10, is to
go back to the tackle spot. He
played end last year, but was an
all-state tackle in high school.
ANOTHER major change will
see Ray Mansfield, the talented
junior, going to the pivot spot.
The hope is that the 6-3, 220-pound
standout will help fill tho void
created by the graduation of All-

America center Roy McKesson. The outlook is questionable, but the
Huskies are now carrying a winning tradition, started by such as
Bob Schloredt, McKasson. Kurt Gegner and the never say-die Don
McKeta, and they could be tough.

Early Tears from Oregon

A news letter from Eugene, Oregon, wasted no time in crying the
blues of graduation- a song which seems to be the theme of college
coaches. Gone are all-coast quarterback Dave Grosz, who accounted
for more than 3,000 yards in his varsity career, and halfbacks Cleve
land Jones and Dave Grayson. Jones and Grayson were one-two in
rushing and pass receiving the past season. Those at Stanford who
remember the small (5-3%, 1471 but devastating Jones are not cry
ing too hard.

The current bright spot for the Webfoots, who have won 15, lost
four and tied one in the last two regular season, is in the line, where
all-coast tackle Steve Barnett, a 245-pound junior leads the way. Bar
nett will be pushed for All-America honors and with good justifi
cation.

MEANWHILE, our own cards are not sitting around, still stunned
from the tragic episode of last fall.
Ninety-four men were listed on the tentative spring roster, and
forty of them are from last year’s very good freshman squad. The
accent this season will clearly be on youth, for Coach Cactus Jack
Curtice is faced with a rebuilding problem. Eight of the eleven regu
lars from the 1960 team were lost by graduation.

Backfield Starts from Scratch

The entile starting back field of the 0-10 sadness—Dick Norman,
quarterback; Mac Wylie, left halfback; Gil Dowd, right halfback; and
Skip Face, fullback, will be missing as will Dale Ostrander, end;
Dean Hinshaw, tackle; Don Peter, guard; and Ron Fernandes, guard.
ALL IS not black however as regulars Steve Pursell, Phil Toor
vald, Tom Walsh and Chris Cottle will be back. Other lettermen
slated for heavy duty in the hopeful comeback include ends Chet
Hinshaw and Rich Hearney; Chuck Buehler, Jack Gordon, C. B.
Simons, and Randy Vahan, tackles; guards Chuck Morehouse, Steve
Player. Starr Rounds, and Errol Scott; center John Butler; quarter
backs Rod Sears, Bob Price and Gary Sargent; halfbacks Ed Cum
mings, Tim Hansel, Larry Royse and Hal Steuber; and fullbacks
Gary Craig and Stan Lindskog.
Right now it looks as if almost every spot on the team is up for
grabs, with the edge going to Rod Sears in the all important
quarterback derby.
The Indians face a tough ten-game schedule which includes in
tersectional opponents, Tulane and Michigan State; Oregon State,
San Jose State, Washington, UCLA, Oregon, Southern California,
Washington State and California.
FOR THOSE who just can’t wait, you may rush the season by
sneaking out to the football practice field. The team workouts are
being held Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday each week.
The finale is the annual Varsity-Alumni game on May 20.

DICK NORMAN
Must do it without him.
While the football season is still a long way off (the trackmen
are still busy pulling muscles) small bits of information have already
started drifting to the sports desk.
“There’s nothing wrong that a little good weather wouldn’t cure,”
Coach Jim Owens said last week in appraising the first week of
spring football turnouts at the University of Washington.
UNSEASONABLY cold, wet weather has hampered the defending
Rose Bowl champions since they started working out two weeks ago.
The first week, which saw the Huskies get in but 5 of their 20 ses
sions. was spent mostly on briefing the newcomers who will try to
pick up the slack caused by graduation.

The men from Seattle were hit
hard in the diploma game late in
June, and there are only 11 re
turning lettermen among the 80
hopefuls who greeted the youth
ful Owens. Only one of these,
Jim Skaggs, was a starter on last
year’s Rose Bowl championship
eleven. Skaggs, a 6-2. 215-pound
junior, played right end last sea
son, but will he switched to guard
this year.
It’s one of several changes
planned by the Husky coaches.
Big John Meyers, 0-6, 2-10, is to
go back to the tackle spot. He
played end last year, but was an
all-state tackle in high school.
ANOTHER major change will
see Ray Mansfield, the talented
junior, going to the pivot spot.
The hope is that the 6-3, 220-pound
standout will help fill tho void
created by the graduation of All-

America center Roy McKesson. The outlook is questionable, but the
Huskies are now carrying a winning tradition, started by such as
Bob Schloredt, McKasson. Kurt Gegner and the never say-die Don
McKeta, and they could be tough.

Early Tears from Oregon

A news letter from Eugene, Oregon, wasted no time in crying the
blues of graduation- a song which seems to be the theme of college
coaches. Gone are all-coast quarterback Dave Grosz, who accounted
for more than 3,000 yards in his varsity career, and halfbacks Cleve
land Jones and Dave Grayson. Jones and Grayson were one-two in
rushing and pass receiving the past season. Those at Stanford who
remember the small (5-3%, 1471 but devastating Jones are not cry
ing too hard.

The current bright spot for the Webfoots, who have won 15, lost
four and tied one in the last two regular season, is in the line, where
all-coast tackle Steve Barnett, a 245-pound junior leads the way. Bar
nett will be pushed for All-America honors and with good justifi
cation.

MEANWHILE, our own cards are not sitting around, still stunned
from the tragic episode of last fall.
Ninety-four men were listed on the tentative spring roster, and
forty of them are from last year’s very good freshman squad. The
accent this season will clearly be on youth, for Coach Cactus Jack
Curtice is faced with a rebuilding problem. Eight of the eleven regu
lars from the 1960 team were lost by graduation.

Backfield Starts from Scratch

The entile starting back field of the 0-10 sadness—Dick Norman,
quarterback; Mac Wylie, left halfback; Gil Dowd, right halfback; and
Skip Face, fullback, will be missing as will Dale Ostrander, end;
Dean Hinshaw, tackle; Don Peter, guard; and Ron Fernandes, guard.
ALL IS not black however as regulars Steve Pursell, Phil Toor
vald, Tom Walsh and Chris Cottle will be back. Other lettermen
slated for heavy duty in the hopeful comeback include ends Chet
Hinshaw and Rich Hearney; Chuck Buehler, Jack Gordon, C. B.
Simons, and Randy Vahan, tackles; guards Chuck Morehouse, Steve
Player. Starr Rounds, and Errol Scott; center John Butler; quarter
backs Rod Sears, Bob Price and Gary Sargent; halfbacks Ed Cum
mings, Tim Hansel, Larry Royse and Hal Steuber; and fullbacks
Gary Craig and Stan Lindskog.
Right now it looks as if almost every spot on the team is up for
grabs, with the edge going to Rod Sears in the all important
quarterback derby.
The Indians face a tough ten-game schedule which includes in
tersectional opponents, Tulane and Michigan State; Oregon State,
San Jose State, Washington, UCLA, Oregon, Southern California,
Washington State and California.

The Indians face a tough ten-game schedule which includes in
tersectional opponents, Tulane and Michigan State; Oregon State,
San Jose State, Washington, UCLA, Oregon, Southern California,
Washington State and California.
FOR THOSE who just can’t wait, you may rush the season by
sneaking out to the football practice field. The team workouts are
being held Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday each week.
The finale is the annual Varsity-Alumni game on May 20.


DICK NORMAN
Must do it without him.
While the football season is still a long way off (the trackmen
are still busy pulling muscles) small bits of information have already
started drifting to the sports desk.
“There’s nothing wrong that a little good weather wouldn’t cure,”
Coach Jim Owens said last week in appraising the first week of
spring football turnouts at the University of Washington.
UNSEASONABLY cold, wet weather has hampered the defending
Rose Bowl champions since they started working out two weeks ago.
The first week, which saw the Huskies get in but 5 of their 20 ses
sions. was spent mostly on briefing the newcomers who will try to
pick up the slack caused by graduation.

The men from Seattle were hit
hard in the diploma game late in
June, and there are only 11 re
turning lettermen among the 80
hopefuls who greeted the youth
ful Owens. Only one of these,
Jim Skaggs, was a starter on last
year’s Rose Bowl championship
eleven. Skaggs, a 6-2. 215-pound
junior, played right end last sea
son, but will he switched to guard
this year.
It’s one of several changes
planned by the Husky coaches.
Big John Meyers, 0-6, 2-10, is to
go back to the tackle spot. He
played end last year, but was an
all-state tackle in high school.
ANOTHER major change will
see Ray Mansfield, the talented
junior, going to the pivot spot.
The hope is that the 6-3, 220-pound
standout will help fill tho void
created by the graduation of All-

America center Roy McKesson. The outlook is questionable, but the
Huskies are now carrying a winning tradition, started by such as
Bob Schloredt, McKasson. Kurt Gegner and the never say-die Don
McKeta, and they could be tough.

Early Tears from Oregon

A news letter from Eugene, Oregon, wasted no time in crying the
blues of graduation- a song which seems to be the theme of college
coaches. Gone are all-coast quarterback Dave Grosz, who accounted
for more than 3,000 yards in his varsity career, and halfbacks Cleve
land Jones and Dave Grayson. Jones and Grayson were one-two in
rushing and pass receiving the past season. Those at Stanford who
remember the small (5-3%, 1471 but devastating Jones are not cry
ing too hard.

The current bright spot for the Webfoots, who have won 15, lost
four and tied one in the last two regular season, is in the line, where
all-coast tackle Steve Barnett, a 245-pound junior leads the way. Bar
nett will be pushed for All-America honors and with good justifi
cation.

MEANWHILE, our own cards are not sitting around, still stunned
from the tragic episode of last fall.
Ninety-four men were listed on the tentative spring roster, and
forty of them are from last year’s very good freshman squad. The
accent this season will clearly be on youth, for Coach Cactus Jack
Curtice is faced with a rebuilding problem. Eight of the eleven regu
lars from the 1960 team were lost by graduation.

Backfield Starts from Scratch

The entile starting back field of the 0-10 sadness—Dick Norman,
quarterback; Mac Wylie, left halfback; Gil Dowd, right halfback; and
Skip Face, fullback, will be missing as will Dale Ostrander, end;
Dean Hinshaw, tackle; Don Peter, guard; and Ron Fernandes, guard.
ALL IS not black however as regulars Steve Pursell, Phil Toor
vald, Tom Walsh and Chris Cottle will be back. Other lettermen
slated for heavy duty in the hopeful comeback include ends Chet
Hinshaw and Rich Hearney; Chuck Buehler, Jack Gordon, C. B.
Simons, and Randy Vahan, tackles; guards Chuck Morehouse, Steve
Player. Starr Rounds, and Errol Scott; center John Butler; quarter
backs Rod Sears, Bob Price and Gary Sargent; halfbacks Ed Cum
mings, Tim Hansel, Larry Royse and Hal Steuber; and fullbacks
Gary Craig and Stan Lindskog.
Right now it looks as if almost every spot on the team is up for
grabs, with the edge going to Rod Sears in the all important
quarterback derby.
