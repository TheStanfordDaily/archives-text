## Indians Take on S.F. State 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Tho Stanford basehallers face
the difficult task of trying to
bounce back from a pair of week
end losses against the tough San
Francisco State Gators today on
the Sunken Diamond at 3:15.

The Gators have met crack op
position all season in non-league
games and to date have a 16-4 j
slate.
To hurl against the San Fran-j
ciscans, Stanford Coach Dutch |
Fehring has nominated Earl Rus-1
sell.
RUSSELL comes off an impres- i
sive performance against South
ern California in which he allowed ;
only one hit and no runs in three
innings. Fehring’s desire to beat
the Gators is reflected in his state
ment that he “would use any one
on the pitching staff in relief if,
the occasion calls for it.”
This comment was made with
two games against California;
coming up over the weekend,
j In the field Stanford will use
I the same eight players who have |
[started since Fehring decided to
j shake up the lineup following a
j three loss weekend.
808 OVERMAN is the catcher; i
Lee Moench, first base; Mike Ma- !
gee, the court jester, second base;
[Rich Ferrazzano, third base; Joel
I Shulman. shortstop; John Hurl
but, left field; Hal Schutzman,
center field; and Skip Lawrence, j
right field.
The two losses plunged Stan-!
ford further into the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion celler with a 1-7 league mark,
while Southern California rose
into undisputed possession of the
league lead with an 8-2 record.
UCLA and California split a
pair of games, with UCLA drop
ping from a tie for first to second !
; place in the conference, and Cal
holding third place. Santa Clara i
was idle in league competition and :
holds a 2-7 slate.
OF INTEREST to baseball fans >
is the performance of Cal’s num
ber one hurler Bill Oakley in Fri
day’s game against UCLA. Oak
-1 ley had a no-hitter going for 8%
j innings, whereupon three Bruins
, got consecutive hits, to ruin Oak
! ley’s bid for a no-hitter, his shut
j out, and his chance for victory.
I Cal lost 1-0.
