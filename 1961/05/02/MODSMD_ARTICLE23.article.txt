# Mays' Hits Lift Giants
## 
### United Press International 
When Warren Spahn pitched a
no-hitter against the San Fran
cisco Giants on Friday, he ven
tured the opinion that Willie
Mays was “swinging bad.’’ Spah
nie was dead wrong.
The “Say Hey” kid hit four
homers Sunday to help demolish
the Milwaukee Braves, and join a
select group of eight other slug
gers—including the late, immor
tal Lou Gehrig who have accom
plished this feat.
“IT was my greatest day,”
Mays said, surpassing his famed
over the-head catch in deep cen
terfield against the Cleveland In
dians in the 1954 World Series.
“Fielding doesn’t bother me,” Wil
lie said, “hut when I’m not hitting,
I worry.”
