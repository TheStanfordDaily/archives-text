# Weather May Delay U.S. Astronaut's Flight
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(UPl)—America’s man - in • space
capsule and the chosen astronaut
stood ready last night to rocket
into space. But a sudden change
in the weather left the project
with an estimated 50-50 chance of
blasting off early this morning.
No rain—an important factor—
was expected by daylight, but a
partial cloud cover was predicted,
as well as winds just on the bor
derline of being too strong.
FEDERAL space administrator
James E. Webb sounded a note of
caution for Americans not to ex
pect too much from the flight and
not to bo disheartened by any
failures along the road to space.
He said in a statement issued
here that “our first manner space
flight is an important milestone
in the progress of our space ef
fort. But wo must keep the per
spective that each flight is but one
of the many milestones we must
pass.”
“Some will completely succeed
in every respect,” ho said, “some
partially, and some will fail,” he
•said.
“I FEEL quite positive there
will be no precipitation tomor

row,” Project Mercury weather
man Ernest Ammon said last
night. “That was one point we
were concerned about.”

The 66.000 pound Redstone
rocket stood ready on its pad at
the south end of Cape Canaveral.
Last minute checks were made
on its mechanism as the count
down headed into the final hours.
The Astronaut whose name
still has not been announced—
went to bed early in the evening
to rest before squeezing into the
bell-shaped capsule designed to
carry America’s first man into
space.
ON Cape Canaveral itself, the
countdown was continuing on the
Redstone at its location on pad
No. 5. Nearly 10,000 men, includ
ing scientists, technicians, and
crews of the seven-ship recovery
fleet, were ready.
The painstaking two-day pre
launch checkout of rocket and
cabin equipment was proceeding
“with no complaints,” officials
said.
Speculation on the astronaut’s
identity centered on Navy Cmdr.
Alan B. Shepard as the man who
would climb into the capsule.

night. “That was one point we
were concerned about.”

The 66.000 pound Redstone
rocket stood ready on its pad at
the south end of Cape Canaveral.
Last minute checks were made
on its mechanism as the count
down headed into the final hours.
The Astronaut whose name
still has not been announced—
went to bed early in the evening
to rest before squeezing into the
bell-shaped capsule designed to
carry America’s first man into
space.
ON Cape Canaveral itself, the
countdown was continuing on the
Redstone at its location on pad
No. 5. Nearly 10,000 men, includ
ing scientists, technicians, and
crews of the seven-ship recovery
fleet, were ready.
The painstaking two-day pre
launch checkout of rocket and
cabin equipment was proceeding
“with no complaints,” officials
said.
Speculation on the astronaut’s
identity centered on Navy Cmdr.
Alan B. Shepard as the man who
would climb into the capsule.
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(UPl)—America’s man - in • space
capsule and the chosen astronaut
stood ready last night to rocket
into space. But a sudden change
in the weather left the project
with an estimated 50-50 chance of
blasting off early this morning.
No rain—an important factor—
was expected by daylight, but a
partial cloud cover was predicted,
as well as winds just on the bor
derline of being too strong.
FEDERAL space administrator
James E. Webb sounded a note of
caution for Americans not to ex
pect too much from the flight and
not to bo disheartened by any
failures along the road to space.
He said in a statement issued
here that “our first manner space
flight is an important milestone
in the progress of our space ef
fort. But wo must keep the per
spective that each flight is but one
of the many milestones we must
pass.”
“Some will completely succeed
in every respect,” ho said, “some
partially, and some will fail,” he
•said.
“I FEEL quite positive there
will be no precipitation tomor

row,” Project Mercury weather
man Ernest Ammon said last
night. “That was one point we
were concerned about.”
