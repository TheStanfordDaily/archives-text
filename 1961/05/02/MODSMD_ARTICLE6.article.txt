## Illegal Votes Pinned on Election Com Members 
### GREGG HOPKINS 
Three members of the ASSU Elections Committee, including one
person elected to a high campus post in the recently concluded
spring ASSU balloting, have been convicted by Men's Council of

tampering with votes in fall quarl
the University.
Dean of Students H. Donald
Council action in a statement’yes
terday giving his approval of the
Council’s recommendation that
one of tiie throe be suspended for
five quarters, the second for four, |
and the third for one quarter.

THE ASSU constitution forbids
release by Men’s Council of the
names of the students brought be
fore it for action and Daily policy
is not to publish student names.
The illegal action, which took
place during counting of the voles
in the fall quarter primary bal
loting, was explained this way by
Men’s Council Chairman Rich
Guggenhimc:
The name of Marty Collins was
written in on ballots for a posi
tion on Women’s Council as Elec
tions Com members were tallying
the votes. Miss Collins’ name was
written on about 100 ballots. She
was not an official candidate for
the office, had no knowledge of
the illegal action and was in no
way implicated in the Men’s Coun
cil investigation.
WINBIGLEH’S statement says
in part, “it was determined with
out any doubt that the outcome
of the election was unaffected by
the incorrect tallying and the
Council was satisfied that there
was no organized effort to rig the
election.”
THE Men’s Council investiga
tion began at that time, said Gug
genhime, and included inspection
of the fall ballots—normally kept
for a year following an election,
said Royse. The handwriting on
about 100 ballots was very simi
lar, Guggenhime stated, and sub
sequent investigation brought the
full situation into the open. Trial
before the council was held April
20-24.

Three members of the ASSU Elections Committee, including one
person elected to a high campus post in the recently concluded
spring ASSU balloting, have been convicted by Men's Council of

tampering with votes in fall quarl

Council action in a statement’yes
terday giving his approval of the
Council’s recommendation that
one of tiie throe be suspended for
five quarters, the second for four, |
and the third for one quarter.

THE ASSU constitution forbids
release by Men’s Council of the
names of the students brought be
fore it for action and Daily policy
is not to publish student names.
The illegal action, which took
place during counting of the voles
in the fall quarter primary bal
loting, was explained this way by
Men’s Council Chairman Rich
Guggenhimc:
The name of Marty Collins was
written in on ballots for a posi
tion on Women’s Council as Elec
tions Com members were tallying
the votes. Miss Collins’ name was
written on about 100 ballots. She
was not an official candidate for
the office, had no knowledge of
the illegal action and was in no
way implicated in the Men’s Coun
cil investigation.
WINBIGLEH’S statement says
in part, “it was determined with
out any doubt that the outcome
of the election was unaffected by
the incorrect tallying and the
Council was satisfied that there
was no organized effort to rig the
election.”
THE Men’s Council investiga
tion began at that time, said Gug
genhime, and included inspection
of the fall ballots—normally kept
for a year following an election,
said Royse. The handwriting on
about 100 ballots was very simi
lar, Guggenhime stated, and sub
sequent investigation brought the
full situation into the open. Trial
before the council was held April
20-24.
