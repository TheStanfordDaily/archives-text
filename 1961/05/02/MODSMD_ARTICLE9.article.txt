# Farm Housing—Part of Academic Life?
## 
### ILENE STRELITZ 
Student housing at Stanford should not bo a hotel
problem, it should be an integrated part of the Univer
sity’s academic program.
That view, expressed by Provost Frederick Terman
five months ago, will gain moaning in coming months
as the Stanford PACE drive gains momentum.
SEVERAL resident housing programs are high on
the PACE priority list, and future housing programs
will reflect many refinements in the thinking that
started the faculty resident program in Wilbur in 1955
and the faculty associate program in Lagunita in 1959.
“We feel the academic people should be more ag
gressive and have more voice in housing policies.” Ter
man continued. We are beginning to move into this field,
but we are still in the stage of tackling the problem
rather than suggesting specific plans for enlargement or
change of present policies. There is an increasing reali
zation that housing ranks as an academic problem.”
With, then, much official concern being directed to
student-faculty relations, The Daily turned for analysis
of one facet of this field to a group involved in a very
distinctive manner—faculty associates.
With a general cry of "Not enough time!” the near
dozen professors queried expressed an almost unanimous
preference for the resident program (faculty members
and their families actually living within the student resi
dence area) to the associate (faculty member visiting
and participating in the activities of a particular resi
dence or (dub).
WITH THE suggestions and evaluations made by the
associates, students presently working with the problem
can obtain an idea of what the faculty associates feel is

valuable, and what type of activities they wish to par
ticipate in.
In a program described by a freshman house presi
dent as “just about, the most valuable thing I’ve hit at
Stanford” and by a fraternity president as “currently
and ultimately a failure,” there is a need to discover
what can be done with the policy.
Otis Pease, associate professor of history and asso
ciate at Wilbur, condemns faculty associate-led discus
sions as part of the program. “The benefits of those
discussions benefit only the few that feel obligated to
show up.”
UNREHEARSED and spontaneous discussions rub
off the most. The best feature of the program from the
faculty point of view is the informality among the stu
dents in the residence hall concerning faculty relations.
“After going to three or four meals a week at the
hall. I feel no sense of uneasiness or obligation to talk
about one particular thing among the students,” con
tinued Pease.
“In no other part of academic life can this happen;
it is the one time the faculty member is unprepared as
far as what he is going to say.”
IN CONCLUSION, Pease aired an opinion that was
expressed by several of his fellow associates: “Women
students are a good deal less at case and on formal man
ners. What I like is a great deal of casual interchange
of ideas, and in my association I’ve found it stimulating
and civilized.
“Until radically different steps are taken by the ad
ministration in reference to student residences, the pro
gram is as good as it can get. I would like, for example
to sec seminars tied in with the residences. The system

could be improved, but only as the result of far reaching
administrative decisions.”

John Bunzel, associate professor of political science,
confirms the associate preference for informal discus
sion as opposed to stringently outlined plans.
“I FIND IT stimulating to talk at dinner with the
students over serious matters which deserve to bo dis
cussed informally, even heatedly. A faculty associate is
not one who goes over to live with them and play with
them, amusing them.
“Anything beyond discussion they would like to plan
is up to them; any successful program must come from
the students.” Bunzel cited as an event he particularly
enjoyed the attendance at dinner the night his group
invited a member of the John Birch Society to speak.
Bunzel personally sees a large scope for the faculty
associate in light of the fact “too few students have the
opportunity to sit down and talk about serious personal
problems, and what they are doing with their lives.”
MUCH OF THK value of the program depends, ac
cording to this professor, on the care exercised by the
group in choosing their associate. Picking a faculty
member they know, who reflects interests common to
the group, and who is spoken to extensively before
being chosen for the position, ranks high on his list.
He emphasizes, though, “the impetus must come
from I lie students, not the faculty member.”
A vast majority of the associates viewed the asso
ciate program as only a half-way step to what should
lead to an extension of the residence program. As ex
pressed by Stuart Fox, “Only when actually living in
the student facilities can the faculty member establish
a great enough air of informality and availability to be
truly valuable.”

a great enough air of informality and availability to be
truly valuable.”
Student housing at Stanford should not bo a hotel
problem, it should be an integrated part of the Univer
sity’s academic program.
That view, expressed by Provost Frederick Terman
five months ago, will gain moaning in coming months
as the Stanford PACE drive gains momentum.
SEVERAL resident housing programs are high on
the PACE priority list, and future housing programs
will reflect many refinements in the thinking that
started the faculty resident program in Wilbur in 1955
and the faculty associate program in Lagunita in 1959.
“We feel the academic people should be more ag
gressive and have more voice in housing policies.” Ter
man continued. We are beginning to move into this field,
but we are still in the stage of tackling the problem
rather than suggesting specific plans for enlargement or
change of present policies. There is an increasing reali
zation that housing ranks as an academic problem.”
With, then, much official concern being directed to
student-faculty relations, The Daily turned for analysis
of one facet of this field to a group involved in a very
distinctive manner—faculty associates.
With a general cry of "Not enough time!” the near
dozen professors queried expressed an almost unanimous
preference for the resident program (faculty members
and their families actually living within the student resi
dence area) to the associate (faculty member visiting
and participating in the activities of a particular resi
dence or (dub).
WITH THE suggestions and evaluations made by the
associates, students presently working with the problem
can obtain an idea of what the faculty associates feel is

valuable, and what type of activities they wish to par
ticipate in.
In a program described by a freshman house presi
dent as “just about, the most valuable thing I’ve hit at
Stanford” and by a fraternity president as “currently
and ultimately a failure,” there is a need to discover
what can be done with the policy.
Otis Pease, associate professor of history and asso
ciate at Wilbur, condemns faculty associate-led discus
sions as part of the program. “The benefits of those
discussions benefit only the few that feel obligated to
show up.”
UNREHEARSED and spontaneous discussions rub
off the most. The best feature of the program from the
faculty point of view is the informality among the stu
dents in the residence hall concerning faculty relations.
“After going to three or four meals a week at the
hall. I feel no sense of uneasiness or obligation to talk
about one particular thing among the students,” con
tinued Pease.
“In no other part of academic life can this happen;
it is the one time the faculty member is unprepared as
far as what he is going to say.”
IN CONCLUSION, Pease aired an opinion that was
expressed by several of his fellow associates: “Women
students are a good deal less at case and on formal man
ners. What I like is a great deal of casual interchange
of ideas, and in my association I’ve found it stimulating
and civilized.
“Until radically different steps are taken by the ad
ministration in reference to student residences, the pro
gram is as good as it can get. I would like, for example
to sec seminars tied in with the residences. The system

could be improved, but only as the result of far reaching
administrative decisions.”

John Bunzel, associate professor of political science,
confirms the associate preference for informal discus
sion as opposed to stringently outlined plans.
“I FIND IT stimulating to talk at dinner with the
students over serious matters which deserve to bo dis
cussed informally, even heatedly. A faculty associate is
not one who goes over to live with them and play with
them, amusing them.
“Anything beyond discussion they would like to plan
is up to them; any successful program must come from
the students.” Bunzel cited as an event he particularly
enjoyed the attendance at dinner the night his group
invited a member of the John Birch Society to speak.
Bunzel personally sees a large scope for the faculty
associate in light of the fact “too few students have the
opportunity to sit down and talk about serious personal
problems, and what they are doing with their lives.”
MUCH OF THK value of the program depends, ac
cording to this professor, on the care exercised by the
group in choosing their associate. Picking a faculty
member they know, who reflects interests common to
the group, and who is spoken to extensively before
being chosen for the position, ranks high on his list.
He emphasizes, though, “the impetus must come
from I lie students, not the faculty member.”
A vast majority of the associates viewed the asso
ciate program as only a half-way step to what should
lead to an extension of the residence program. As ex
pressed by Stuart Fox, “Only when actually living in

the student facilities can the faculty member establish
a great enough air of informality and availability to be
truly valuable.”
Student housing at Stanford should not bo a hotel
problem, it should be an integrated part of the Univer
sity’s academic program.
That view, expressed by Provost Frederick Terman
five months ago, will gain moaning in coming months
as the Stanford PACE drive gains momentum.
SEVERAL resident housing programs are high on
the PACE priority list, and future housing programs
will reflect many refinements in the thinking that
started the faculty resident program in Wilbur in 1955
and the faculty associate program in Lagunita in 1959.
“We feel the academic people should be more ag
gressive and have more voice in housing policies.” Ter
man continued. We are beginning to move into this field,
but we are still in the stage of tackling the problem
rather than suggesting specific plans for enlargement or
change of present policies. There is an increasing reali
zation that housing ranks as an academic problem.”
With, then, much official concern being directed to
student-faculty relations, The Daily turned for analysis
of one facet of this field to a group involved in a very
distinctive manner—faculty associates.
With a general cry of "Not enough time!” the near
dozen professors queried expressed an almost unanimous
preference for the resident program (faculty members
and their families actually living within the student resi
dence area) to the associate (faculty member visiting
and participating in the activities of a particular resi
dence or (dub).
WITH THE suggestions and evaluations made by the
associates, students presently working with the problem
can obtain an idea of what the faculty associates feel is

valuable, and what type of activities they wish to par
ticipate in.
In a program described by a freshman house presi
dent as “just about, the most valuable thing I’ve hit at
Stanford” and by a fraternity president as “currently
and ultimately a failure,” there is a need to discover
what can be done with the policy.
Otis Pease, associate professor of history and asso
ciate at Wilbur, condemns faculty associate-led discus
sions as part of the program. “The benefits of those
discussions benefit only the few that feel obligated to
show up.”
UNREHEARSED and spontaneous discussions rub
off the most. The best feature of the program from the
faculty point of view is the informality among the stu
dents in the residence hall concerning faculty relations.
“After going to three or four meals a week at the
hall. I feel no sense of uneasiness or obligation to talk
about one particular thing among the students,” con
tinued Pease.
“In no other part of academic life can this happen;
it is the one time the faculty member is unprepared as
far as what he is going to say.”
IN CONCLUSION, Pease aired an opinion that was
expressed by several of his fellow associates: “Women
students are a good deal less at case and on formal man
ners. What I like is a great deal of casual interchange
of ideas, and in my association I’ve found it stimulating
and civilized.
“Until radically different steps are taken by the ad
ministration in reference to student residences, the pro
gram is as good as it can get. I would like, for example
to sec seminars tied in with the residences. The system

could be improved, but only as the result of far reaching
administrative decisions.”

John Bunzel, associate professor of political science,
confirms the associate preference for informal discus
sion as opposed to stringently outlined plans.
“I FIND IT stimulating to talk at dinner with the
students over serious matters which deserve to bo dis
cussed informally, even heatedly. A faculty associate is
not one who goes over to live with them and play with
them, amusing them.
“Anything beyond discussion they would like to plan
is up to them; any successful program must come from
the students.” Bunzel cited as an event he particularly
enjoyed the attendance at dinner the night his group
invited a member of the John Birch Society to speak.
Bunzel personally sees a large scope for the faculty
associate in light of the fact “too few students have the
opportunity to sit down and talk about serious personal
problems, and what they are doing with their lives.”
MUCH OF THK value of the program depends, ac
cording to this professor, on the care exercised by the
group in choosing their associate. Picking a faculty
member they know, who reflects interests common to
the group, and who is spoken to extensively before
being chosen for the position, ranks high on his list.
He emphasizes, though, “the impetus must come
from I lie students, not the faculty member.”
A vast majority of the associates viewed the asso
ciate program as only a half-way step to what should
lead to an extension of the residence program. As ex
pressed by Stuart Fox, “Only when actually living in
the student facilities can the faculty member establish
a great enough air of informality and availability to be
truly valuable.”
