Then you’d like computer programming, the new career
that makes full use of your logical talents. If you have a
keen analytical and logical mind—and want to use it fully
after college—then computer programming at IBM may
be just the career you’ve always looked forward to.
A computer programmer examines a business, indus
trial, or scientific problem and translates it into a special
mathematical-logical language for the computer. Working
at amazing speeds, the computer can produce answers
in minutes, even seconds. Some of these answers might
actually take days to produce by other methods.
The problems are interesting and varied. IBM pro
grammers have used computers to predict hurricanes, tell
days ahead where satellites will be in space, locate the
best factory sites for businessmen, aid highway engineers
in laying out roads, and help manufacturers find the best
markets for their products.
No previous knowledge of computers is necessary; an
intensive training course will equip you for your work. But
you should have an analytical and logical turn of mind,
and at least two years of college mathematics.
In computer programming you will find that the salaries
are excellent, and that the future can be virtually as un
limited as the future of the computer itself.
The IBM representative will interview on your campus.
He will be glad to give you details about this fascinating
new profession. Your placement office will make an ap
pointment. Or you may write, outlining briefly your back
ground, to: Manager of Technical Recruitment, IBM
Corp., Dept. 902, 590 Madison Avenue, New York 22, N. Y.
You naturally have a better chance to grow with a growth company.
