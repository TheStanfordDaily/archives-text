## 
### 
Yesterday’s session of the City
Hall riot trial marked the last
chance of defense and prosecution
to present their cases before the
jury of 10 women and 2 men de
cides the fate of Robert Meisen
bach, 23, the University of Cali
fornia honor student, accused of
clubbing Officer Ralph Schaum
leffel during the riot last May.
In his closing argument, de
fense attorney Charles Garry ac
cused prosecution witnesses of
perjury in testifying against Moi
senbach.
“THERE’S been a lot of lying
going on in this court room, and
it hasn’t been on the part of the
defense witnesses,” said Garry.
PREVIOUSLY, Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Walter Giubbini
had called a barrage of prosecu
tion witnesses to testify against
Meisenbach. In all, nine wit
nesses. including Officer Schaum
leffel. .were called to testify
against him.
THE DEFENSE responded to
this attack by calling an oyewit
nes, who, for the first time in the
10-day trial, gave support to the
report that Schaumleffel merely
slipped and bumped his head. Sev
eral defense witnesses had said
they saw an officer slip. However,
none could positively identify the
officer as Schaumleffel.
This information was given by
James Toombs, 20, who said he
saw Schaumleffel lying almost at
his feet.
