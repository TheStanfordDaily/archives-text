# S. African Discusses Apartheid

“Tho problem in the Union of
South Africa is influx control,”
stated Dr. Barend Marais, profes
sor of History of Christianity at
the University of Pretoria in the
Union of South Africa, yesterday.
Because "when you don’t know
a country, you have misconcep
tions,” Marais was careful to ex
plain his viewpoint of the racial
situation in the Union. The group
that is involved in apartheid, the
government stand on integration,
is composed of nine million Afri
can Negroes (Bantus), four mil
lion of whom live on their native
homelands. The other five million
have moved to the urban areas.
APAKTHEID philosophy slates
that different racial groups in
South Africa must develop sepa
rately, with no mixing. Govern
ment policy is to develop tribal
homelands and relocate the five
million Bantus there. However,
only Negro-earned capital can be
used in the development. ‘‘White
money” would keep the Africans
as laborers.

Marais believes that separate
development of African home
lands is a good thing, but allows
that one can’t expect to drive back
five million Africans to their
homelands. Conversely, ho says,
one can’t expect the three million
whites who built up the area to
vote themselves into subjection.
DESPITE 12 years of apartheid
doctrine, the population tendency
is for Africans to move into white
areas. Once these people have
adopted a now w r ay of life, they
can’t be expected to return to
their old tribal customs, he said.
Many tribal chiefs are in favor
of apartheid, ho stated. They re
ceive a salary from tho govern
ment and regain some of their
lost authority.
Marais feels that, "the educa
tion program is a time bomb to
apartheid philosophy.” A greater
pei - cent of Africans attend
schools in the Union of South Af
rica than in any other African na
tion. The next five or six years
will prove if apartheid will work,
he believes.
TO A question whether a Congo
situation will develop in the
Union, Marais stated that it is
very unlikely. Ho thinks that a
two-month sitdown strike by the
Africans would be more effective.
The point is that the Africans do
not have the economic reserves to
sustain it, he feels.

ceive a salary from tho govern
ment and regain some of their
lost authority.
Marais feels that, "the educa
tion program is a time bomb to
apartheid philosophy.” A greater
pei - cent of Africans attend
schools in the Union of South Af
rica than in any other African na
tion. The next five or six years
will prove if apartheid will work,
he believes.
TO A question whether a Congo
situation will develop in the
Union, Marais stated that it is
very unlikely. Ho thinks that a
two-month sitdown strike by the
Africans would be more effective.
The point is that the Africans do
not have the economic reserves to
sustain it, he feels.

Professor Explains Apartheid
“Tho problem in the Union of
South Africa is influx control,”
stated Dr. Barend Marais, profes
sor of History of Christianity at
the University of Pretoria in the
Union of South Africa, yesterday.
Because "when you don’t know
a country, you have misconcep
tions,” Marais was careful to ex
plain his viewpoint of the racial
situation in the Union. The group
that is involved in apartheid, the
government stand on integration,
is composed of nine million Afri
can Negroes (Bantus), four mil
lion of whom live on their native
homelands. The other five million
have moved to the urban areas.
APAKTHEID philosophy slates
that different racial groups in
South Africa must develop sepa
rately, with no mixing. Govern
ment policy is to develop tribal
homelands and relocate the five
million Bantus there. However,
only Negro-earned capital can be
used in the development. ‘‘White
money” would keep the Africans
as laborers.

Marais believes that separate
development of African home
lands is a good thing, but allows
that one can’t expect to drive back
five million Africans to their
homelands. Conversely, ho says,
one can’t expect the three million
whites who built up the area to
vote themselves into subjection.
DESPITE 12 years of apartheid
doctrine, the population tendency
is for Africans to move into white
areas. Once these people have
adopted a now w r ay of life, they
can’t be expected to return to
their old tribal customs, he said.
Many tribal chiefs are in favor
of apartheid, ho stated. They re
ceive a salary from tho govern
ment and regain some of their
lost authority.
