# Weather Postpones Astronaut Flight; May Go Friday
## Cloudy Skies Make Hazards 'Too Extreme' 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(UPD—Surly weather grounded
“prime astronaut” Alan B. Shop
aid Jr. yesterday—but only tem
porarily.
Ho will attempt America’s first
manned-rocket trip into space la
ter this week, probably Friday
morning.
He would have gone today if
officials of the Mercury man-in
space project had given the word.
But they refused to add any haz
ard to an inherently dangerous
mission by shooting him off into
a cloudy sky.
THE 37-year-old navy comman
der and his 66.000-pound Redstone
rocket and his ton-and-a-half cabin
were all set to ride 115 miles into
space and 290 miles down the At
lantic missile range at 8 a.m. EOT
today.
Marine Lt. Col. John H. Glenn
Jr., Shepard’s “backup,” was
ready to pinch-hit if necessary.
The Mercury scientists, track
ers, launch crew, doctors, range
controllers, recovery ships, and
the five other Mercury astronauts
all were ready for their special
and vital roles, too.
BUT something not yet control
lable by man, the weather, said
not yet. A cold front spawned in
the central plains states some
days ago had generated a squall
line which swept down through
Florida last night.
At the same time clouds cov
ered and strong winds whipped
(he sea 80 miles northeast of
Grand Bahama Island where a
seven-ship recovery fleet was de
ployed to pick Shepard from the
water after his 15-minute ride.
At a solemn conference last
midnight, the weather men of
project Mercury said there was a
50-50 chance the weather might
get better. It didn’t.
SO at 8:35 a.m. EDT with Shep
ard in his silvery 20-pound space
suit, the Redstone fully fueled,
and the countdown only two
hours and 20 minutes from liftoff,
the shot was “scrubbed.”
On the basis of later forecasts,
Mercury officials said another at
tempt probably can lie made Fri
day morning—possibly as early as
Thursday morning.
SHEPARD was, of course, dis
appointed as he squirmed out of
his pressure suit and went back to
waiting. But as an old space hand
he was philosophical about it. He
knows all about the delays that
can plague rocket shoots.
Throughout the early hours of
the never-completed countdown
there were many interruptions, or
“holds,” because of the weather.
Shepard didn’t bat an eye, al
though some tension was noticed
elsewhere on the Cape.

“prime astronaut” Alan B. Shop
aid Jr. yesterday—but only tem
porarily.
Ho will attempt America’s first
manned-rocket trip into space la

morning.
He would have gone today if
officials of the Mercury man-in
space project had given the word.
But they refused to add any haz
ard to an inherently dangerous
mission by shooting him off into
a cloudy sky.
THE 37-year-old navy comman
der and his 66.000-pound Redstone
rocket and his ton-and-a-half cabin
were all set to ride 115 miles into
space and 290 miles down the At
lantic missile range at 8 a.m. EOT
today.
Marine Lt. Col. John H. Glenn
Jr., Shepard’s “backup,” was
ready to pinch-hit if necessary.
The Mercury scientists, track
ers, launch crew, doctors, range
controllers, recovery ships, and
the five other Mercury astronauts
all were ready for their special
and vital roles, too.
BUT something not yet control
lable by man, the weather, said
not yet. A cold front spawned in
the central plains states some
days ago had generated a squall
line which swept down through
Florida last night.
At the same time clouds cov
ered and strong winds whipped
(he sea 80 miles northeast of
Grand Bahama Island where a
seven-ship recovery fleet was de
ployed to pick Shepard from the
water after his 15-minute ride.
At a solemn conference last
midnight, the weather men of
project Mercury said there was a
50-50 chance the weather might
get better. It didn’t.
SO at 8:35 a.m. EDT with Shep
ard in his silvery 20-pound space
suit, the Redstone fully fueled,
and the countdown only two
hours and 20 minutes from liftoff,
the shot was “scrubbed.”
On the basis of later forecasts,
Mercury officials said another at
tempt probably can lie made Fri
day morning—possibly as early as
Thursday morning.
