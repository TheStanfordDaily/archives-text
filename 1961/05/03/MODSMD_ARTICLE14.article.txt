# More Misconceptions

### 
It is apparent from the editor
ial of Friday, April 28, that the
Daily editor suffers from several
misconceptions regarding the
flurry of student activity at the
time of the American interven
tion in Cuba. As the chief Stan
ford “conspirators” behind the
demonstrations and Wednesday’s
meeting, perhaps we can set the
record straight on several points.
1. The editorial contained ref
erences to “a pre-planned circus
atmosphere” and the “very quick
organization that took place. This
did not just happen. Some mech
anism was involved.” Clearly the
implication is that a sinister plot
is underfoot. In these days of
cold-war hysteria it is not unus
ual for liberal dissent to be im
puted to the skillful organization
and machinations of the interna
tional conspiracy. We appreciate
the fact that the most effective
conservative weapon is the asso
ciation of dissenting ideas with
communism. We cannot combat
the smears and innuendos that
issue forth from the right; we
can only shrug our shoulders—
or retreat into silence or apathy.
2. The second misconception is
that the demonstrations and Wed
nesday’s meetings were pro-Cas
tro. The issue is not and was not
the Cuban revolutionary govern
ment, but the illegal and immoral
actions of the United States Gov
ernment in regard to the sover
eign republic of Cuba. All of the
speakers addressed themselves to
this topic at Wednesday’s meet
ing and the demonstrations were
specifically “anti-intervention.”
3. The charge has been made
from several sources that the
Wednesday meeting was biased.
In a sense this is true. But surely
the HR is not responsible for the
opinions of foreign students, the
statements of those two profes
sors among several who were
asked to speak, or the fact that
in the ample time allotted only
one or two “pro-intervention”
speakers rose to the floor.
4. We regret that the recent
activities of a small group of stu
dents may adversely affect Stan
ford’s fund-raising capabilities.
We can only say that funds with
held because of the failure of the
University to squelch campus
“communism” is money that a
self-respecting university should
reject on any account.

actions of the United States Gov
ernment in regard to the sover
eign republic of Cuba. All of the
speakers addressed themselves to
this topic at Wednesday’s meet
ing and the demonstrations were
specifically “anti-intervention.”
3. The charge has been made
from several sources that the
Wednesday meeting was biased.
In a sense this is true. But surely
the HR is not responsible for the
opinions of foreign students, the
statements of those two profes
sors among several who were
asked to speak, or the fact that
in the ample time allotted only
one or two “pro-intervention”
speakers rose to the floor.
4. We regret that the recent
activities of a small group of stu
dents may adversely affect Stan
ford’s fund-raising capabilities.
We can only say that funds with
held because of the failure of the
University to squelch campus
“communism” is money that a
self-respecting university should
reject on any account.

It is apparent from the editor
ial of Friday, April 28, that the
Daily editor suffers from several
misconceptions regarding the
flurry of student activity at the
time of the American interven
tion in Cuba. As the chief Stan
ford “conspirators” behind the
demonstrations and Wednesday’s
meeting, perhaps we can set the
record straight on several points.
1. The editorial contained ref
erences to “a pre-planned circus
atmosphere” and the “very quick
organization that took place. This
did not just happen. Some mech
anism was involved.” Clearly the
implication is that a sinister plot
is underfoot. In these days of
cold-war hysteria it is not unus
ual for liberal dissent to be im
puted to the skillful organization
and machinations of the interna
tional conspiracy. We appreciate
the fact that the most effective
conservative weapon is the asso
ciation of dissenting ideas with
communism. We cannot combat
the smears and innuendos that
issue forth from the right; we
can only shrug our shoulders—
or retreat into silence or apathy.
2. The second misconception is
that the demonstrations and Wed
nesday’s meetings were pro-Cas
tro. The issue is not and was not
the Cuban revolutionary govern
ment, but the illegal and immoral
actions of the United States Gov
ernment in regard to the sover
eign republic of Cuba. All of the
speakers addressed themselves to
this topic at Wednesday’s meet
