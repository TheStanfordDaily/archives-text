# No Betrayal

Since I am not able to buy ad
vertising to reply to that urging
an end to our intervention in
Cuba, I hope it is allowable to
reply by open letter. The ad in
question, signed by about 120 per
sons, and appearing last Friday
as a petition to Mr. Kennedy, im
plied that Americans can only feel
shame for the invasion of April
17-19.
I, too, am ashamed of this in
vasion. It failed, and the United
States failed to establish a friend
ly government in Cuba. I am
ashamed that we look foolish.
But we have not betrayed our
ideals. Americans are dedicated,
perhaps, “to democracy and na
tional independence for all coun
tries”; but we should be still more
committed to democracy and na
tional independence and security
here at home. A communistic Cu
ban regime (which is not a de
mocracy to which we need dedi
cate ourselves) is a threat to our
own security. In prudence there
is no betrayal and no shame.
When a large country sees that
a small one is aiding or abetting
its very greatest enemies, the ap
propriate course is to prevent the
small nation from doing so any
longer. The government of the
large country has a greater duty
to its own citizens than to the
people of the small country. The
United States is not bound to give
comfort, remorseful re-evalua
tions, or long-suffering to nations
that seek to undermine us or to
side with our enemies.
If the foregoing nationalistic re
marks seem to have some truth,
perhaps the signers of the peti
tion advertisement would ac
knowledge them by not signing
anything else that is against our
own interests.
