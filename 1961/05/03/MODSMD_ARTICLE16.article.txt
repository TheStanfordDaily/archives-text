# Grubby Finger
## 
### 
Again the Daily has missed the
boat. First, if there is any lesson
to be taught as an aftermath of
the election fraud, it should not
be executed in such a manner as
to smear the people under ques
tion. In spite of its pretense at
“protecting the anonymity of the
frauds,” the Daily managed to
rather succinctly point its grub
by finger at the “public person
age” involved. It is certainly con
sistent policy for the mouthpiece
of (he universily (student portion
at least), to speak out for third
person responsibility and to de
cry the manifested lack of same
which has been herewith exempli
fied; but more important, the
Dully should not belie its own
stated purpose of “concealing the
conspirator’s Identity.” We be
lieve that this has been done both
loudly and unsubtly.
Second, and most odious of all,
is the lack of journalistic discre
tion and ethics which now ap
pears rampant in the Daily
shack. Miss Collins was phoned
the night before and asked if her
name or position could be used
in the May 2 article. Since Miss
Collins was not the only candi
date whose votes had been
changed, and because she had no
previous knowledge of the fraud
until a few weeks ago, she saw
no reason to he publicly implicat
ed. Her response, therefore, was
“no”; but both her name and
position were disclosed. We only
ask that the integrity of your
shack be consistent with the
worthwhile words in our paper.
