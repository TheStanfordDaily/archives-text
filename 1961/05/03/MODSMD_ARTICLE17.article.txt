Regarding Friday’s editorial,
which, where not misleading was
certainly vague, I would like to
make a few dissenting comments.
To say that the after-effects of
the Cuban fiasco were in the
main “pro-Castro” demonstrations
is to avoid the real issue as it is
stated in the open petition to
President Kennedy on your own
editorial page. Apparently some
people feel that our policy of in
tervention in Cuba is destroying
our moral integrity and our pres
tige abroad—especially in Latin
America. Their protest is aimed
at correcting what they believe
are moral errors of judgment in
their president—a patriotic mo
tive by anyone’s definition of this
much abused word.
Secondly, the implication that
Stanford and other university
students were dupes of a mysteri
ous organization (no doubt Com
munists) remains a very vague
one. Presumably you would have
your readers: 1) avoid demon
strations where possible mysteri
ous organizations may be pres
ent, 2) flee the scene whenever
“older men and women” cheer
minority causes “rabidly,” 3)
“keep their eyes and ears open”
(and their mouths shut) when in
a demonstration—especially when
there are reporters about and a
$1,000,000 PACE drive is being
initiated for their benefit. This
last piece of advice does full
credit to both the morality and
mentality of your entire editorial.
