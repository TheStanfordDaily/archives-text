# Group Virtues
## 
### 
What with Mr. Whyte’s and
Mr. Riesman’s books having been
around for half a decade now, it
is interesting to see how tenaci
ously The Daily still clings to the
view that “what’s needed . . .
(are) . . . group-accepted virtues.”
Is not the sloppy morality to
which you refer precisely the
product of an attitude relying
completely on (pei’haps tacit)
group acceptance, without both
ering to define an independent
“Weltanschauung”? In view of
the apparent success of our to
talitarian friends it may be opti
mistic to speak about a bank
ruptcy of group-oriented philoso
phy; but if we want to claim any
intrinsic distinction between our
thinking and theirs, we should
get back to thinking, and acting,
as individuals.
