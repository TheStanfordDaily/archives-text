# Prestige Decline
## 
### 
Upon the inauguration of the
new administration, I had great
hopes that U.S. actions and poli
cies would conform more closely
to those of an ideal democracy,
or would at least reflect an aware
ness of the need to remedy our
declining world prestige. The new
approaches to Laos, the Congo
and to neutralists in general, as
well as the positive efforts to ne
gotiate with Communist China (in
Warsaw) and with the U.S.S.R.
were all very promising. How
ever, the recent attempt to over
throw the Castro regime in Cuba
necessarily raises questions as to
the administration’s sincerity and
actual intentions.

It is difficult to understand the
administration’s vigorous pro
tests made in response to accusa
tions that the U.S. is (or was)
aiding the counterrevolutionaries,
since it is highly unlikely that
such a revolt would have occurred
in the face of U.S. opposition el
even actual neutralism. The re
action of the Cuban people seems
to indicate that there was not suf
ficient discontent to result even
in disaffection in Cuba itself once
the revolt began.
If no agency of (he U.S. govern
ment encouraged or aided the
counterrevolutionaries, then the
government certainly did not ex
ercise any effective restraint on
those Americans seeking pri
vately to aid the anti-Castro
forces, whether located in the
U.S. or in those Latin American
states particularly friendly with
the U.S.

Success by the “Cuban Freedom
Fighters,” who were apparently
agreed only on the necessity of
ousting Castro, might have re
sulted in a situation embarras
singly similar to those con
demned internationally as im
perialistic.
Whatever the extent of U.S. aid,
formal or informal, there is no
doubt in the minds of neutral na
tions in Latin America, Asia and
Africa, that the revolt took place
with U.S. complicity; an opinion
which is reinforced by the State
Department’s declaration of sym
pathy for the counterrevolution
ary cause. Neutralists cannot but
question U.S. righteous protests
against accusations of imperial
istic pursuits.
The revolt now has probably
set U.S.-Latin American relations
back many years and has weak
ened the status of the U.S., mor
ally at least, in world opinion.
Whatever the expectations of U.S.
strategists, the calculated risk
seems to have been in favor of
Communist gains, in propaganda,
if not more substantial terms.
A look at the evolution of Mex
ico since its equally leftist revo
lution of 1910, and at other Latin
American incidents, demonstrates
that the American states, with
time, have always been able to
settle their serious conflicts. Why
was it necessary for the U.S. to
risk such a defeat in this matter?
It is hoped that the New Fron
tier will have better ways of rem
edying the decline in U.S. pres
tige in the future.
