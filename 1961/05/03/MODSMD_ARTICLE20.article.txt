# Great Individuals

### 
I’m as excited as the next guy
(or girl) about Stanford’s Ford
grant—about dollars rolling in
and the opportunity of the PACE
program to make Stanford a
“great University.” But I can’t
help remarking that there ap
pears to be a certain unreal and
unhealthy element in our think
ing on the subject, as expressed
in recent Daily articles, editorials,
etc.

Lest “success spoil Stanford U.”
it might behoove us to bear in
mind that greatness, like happi
ness, can’t simply be purchased,
at any price.
Higher pay may attract better
professors, but it can’t create
them. A new infirmary may fa
cilitate treatment, but it can’t in
sure wise diagnoses or personal
concern. A new’ library may make
more books available, but it can’t
prevent thoughtless students
from carting them off unauthor
ized.

These are matters of personal
integrity, and of individual efforts
to attain it. They are matters
which we will still have to cope
with when we've built every cam
pus facility we could ever wish
for. Furthermore, they are things
we could be working on right
now, in our present surroundings.
$lOO million may go far —but a
collection of excellent individuals
will be what makes our Univer
sity truly great.
