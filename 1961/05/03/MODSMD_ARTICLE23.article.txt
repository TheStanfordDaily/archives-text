## Mr. Welch Has Right To Keep Witch-Hunting

I don’t like them either.
But that doesn’t mean they are
wrong.

In investigat-i
ing the John j
Birch Society,
the House com
mittee on Un-
American Activi 1
ties is once agair
violating the i
rights of the:
American people
The Constitutior j
guarantees the!
right of peaceful

assembly, and it is of this right
the Society is availing itself.

Should the activities of this
anti-Communist group be illegal
in any way—for instance, should
their unevidenced charges of com
munism be deemed libelous—it is
up to the normal process of law
to block them.

Should it be felt that their ac
tivities are harmful to such an
immense degree that the group
(whose very aim is to block com
munism l is actually attracting
communists who wait to take ad
vantage of the opportunity to di
vide the American people, let J.
Edgar Hoover and his band duly
investigate and bring charges
against those people about whom
they procure evidence.
The Committee is afraid it
doesn’t like what the retired can
dy-maker James Welch is saying,
nor the manner in which he says
it. Parenthetically, this is quite
odd as the man is doing nothing
more than the committee itself,
except possibly make a more de
termined and successful effort
(or removing people he’s against
from their jobs and their home
community). Could it be that the
committee has looked into a stag
nant and insect-filled pond and
doesn’t like the reflection it sees?
No matter what the House in
vestigators think of what is be
ing said, without drawing indis
criminate lines (a real jump for
communism) they can’t stop it.
Unless an existing written law
is being violated, in which case
local law enforcement will step
in, no one but a dictator or a dic
tatorial body can block an ac
tivity.
The notoriety afforded the
Birch society by this latest coup
will merely add to its strength,

while the needed action with
drawal of support of the group
by the public will be delayed
just a bit longer.
Until he is ousted by legal pro
cedures acting within the limits
of our judicial code, Mr. Welch
has the perfect right to keep
right on witch-hunting.
