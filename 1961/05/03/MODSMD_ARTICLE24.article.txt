## GOP Believes Party Fortunes on Upswing 
### 
Although President Kennedy
dominates the headlines, the Re
publicans believe that the political
trend is going their way.
Republican party fortunes are
on the upswing. This year’s cru
cial election test the important
New Jersey governorship will
almost certainly add to Republi
can strength.
THE primary victory of Eisen
hower’s Secretary of Labor James
P. Mitchell in the contest for the
Republican nomination in the
New Jersey governorship race is
significant for several reasons.

It shows rank-and-file Republi
can voters overruling the party
organization with a candidate of
their own choosing.
It shows how an outstandingly
qualified man arouses the interest
of the electorate.
NEW JERSEY Democrats could
not themselves agree on a strong
candidate and they were praying
that Mitchell would be cut down
in the primary. Despite the fact
that the Democrats have con
trolled New Jersey for eight
years, a Mitchell victory this fail
is now virtually conceded.
So much attention has been
given to explaining how Mr. Ken
nedy defeated Mr. Nixon that the
Republican strength in the 1960
elections is often overlooked.
Just as President Eisenhower’s
victories in 1952 and 1956 con
cealed the weakness of the Repub
lican party, so President Ken
nedy’s victory in 1960 tends to
conceal the strength of the Repub
lican party.
WHILE Mr. Kennedy was win

ning by the margin of 16/100 of
1 per cent in the popular vote, the
Republicans gained two Senate
seats, increased their strength in
the House by 21, added two gover
norships, and made a net gain of
290 seats in the 50 stale legisla
tures.
While Democratic strength was
receding, Mr. Kennedy ran behind
his party.
While Republican strength was
mounting, Mr. Nixon ran ahead
of his party. He carried 26 states
to Mr. Kennedy’s 23. The close
ness of the Presidential vote is
illustrated by the fact that a
switch of 11,874 votes in the states
of Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, New
Mexico, and Nevada would have
reversed the outcome.
THE Republican party’s great
est need is for more qualified and
attractive candidates for public
office. It usually requires a voter
uprising against the organization
to get them. That is what hap
pened in New Jersey. The New
Jersey Republican organization
was overwhelmingly against Mr.
Mitchell and the Republican vot
ers overturned the organization
choice for the first time in many
years in demanding Mr. Mitchell.
What many Republicans hope
and expect is that a Mitchell vic
tory in New Jersey this Novem
ber and the prospect of a Rocke
feller sweep in New York next
year will persuade Mr. Nixon
that, in his own interests as well
as that of the party, he ought to
run for Governor of California in
1962.
