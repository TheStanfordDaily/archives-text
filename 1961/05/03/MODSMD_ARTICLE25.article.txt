# Tribe Nine Rally Defeats SF State
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
On some last inning heroics, Stanford baseballers defeated San
Francisco State in a cliffhanger 7-6.
Jim Cowart's single with the bases loaded and two out in the
ninth inning tumbled the Gators to defeat after they had the game
locked up in the ninth. There were two out and no one on when

Rich Ferrazzano started the rally
with a single.
With Gordie Austin on first
base running for Ferrazzano
Joel Shulman walked on a 3-2
count. The shaken Gator pitcher
then walked pinch hitter John Or
chard to load the bases. Cowart
lined a two ball, no strike pitch
to right field to score the tying
and winning runs.
THU STANFORD victory was
a comeback effort all the way.
The Gators shelled Earl Russell
in the second inning for three
runs, and got to relief pitcher Dar
rell Sutherland for an unearned
run in the fourth inning for a 4-0
lead going into the sixth inning.
Stanford rallied for three runs
in the bottom of the sixth. Fer
razzano walked, and Shulman
doubled to drive him home. Jack
Allen, pinch-hitting for Suther
land, singled to drive Shulman
home. Leo Moench forced Allen
and scored after singles by Hal
Schutzmann and Skip Lawrence.
State got another pair in the
seventh inning off the slants of
Marv Mecklenburg, hut that was
their last gasp. Mark Miller and
Jim Smith held them thereafter.
STANFORD CAME within a
run in the eighth inning when
Shulman singled and Boh Hansler
hit a home run. Hensler, a pinch
hitter for Miller, golfed the ball
far over the 360 foot sign on the
left center field fence. The blast
was only the 54th home run hit
out of Sunken Diamond since its
construction 31 years ago and the
first hit out of it this year.
Stanford came close to lying

the score right after Hensler’s
home run. A now pitcher came
into the game for San Francisco
State, Ron Bolling, and he walked
Moench on four bad pitches.
He was hunted to second base
by Schutzmann and almost scored
on Skip Lawrence’s bid for a
Texas League single that the left
fielder caught off his shoe tops in
short left center field.
So Stanford had to be content
to wait for the ninth inning and
Cowart’s single.
OF THE PITCHERS, Suther
land had the best stuff. He struck
out nine batters in 4D. innings,
giving up only two hits and an
unearned run.
When Stanford Coach Dutch
Fehring said that he would use
everyone to win the game he
wasn’t fooling. Nineteen Stanford
players paraded on and off the
field, including five pitchers.
He used three pinch-hitters;
Allen singled home a run, Hensler
hit a two-run homer, and Orchard
walked to keep alive the ninth
inning rally.
In addition, he put in Cowart
after Moench had been removed
for a pinch runner, and the sub
stitute first-sacker responded with
the game-winning hit.
