jor league home run record for
the second time in two games
when Willie McCovey homered
with Jim Davenport on base and
one out in the ninth for two runs.
His blow gave San Francisco 14

games, tying the record set by
the New York Yankees in 1936
and equalled by the Boston Red
Sox in 1950 and the Milwaukee
Braves in 1953 and 1956.
Till! GIANTS, who tied an
other major league record with
13 homers in their last two

a single to center. It was Card
well’s third victory without a loss
this year.
Mays, who hit four homers
Sunday to tie a major league rec
ord, failed to hit in four tries
today. On his first appearance,
he worked the count to 3-and-2
and flied out. Next time he
grounded out on the second pitch
and in his third appearance flied
out with the bases full. In the
ninth he flied deep to center field.
The loss, coupled with Pitts
burgh’s late win over St. Louis
by a 6-0 score, put the Giants into
second place with a 10-7 mark.
Pittsburgh moved into first place,
a half-game ahead of the Giants
and Los Angeles.
Philadelphia was at Cincinnati,
Los Angeles at Milwaukee, and
Pittsburgh at St. Louis in N.L.

In the other day game in the
major leagues, a grand slam
home run by Mickey Mantle in
the top of the 10th inning yester
day broke up a tie game and gave
the New York Yankees a 6-4 vic
tory over Minnesota.
The homer, Mantle’s sixth
bases-full blast of his career,
ruined a fine performance by
Twins’ pitcher Camilo Pascual
and handed the Cuban his first
loss of the season.
IN THK LAST of the 10th,
Twins slugger Harmon Killebrew
knocked a home run, his third
in as many games.

Jim Coates, who relieved start
er Art Ditmar, picked up his first
victory of the season. The win
ning blow was Mantle’s eighth
homer of the season and raised
his RBI total to 22.
Minnesota drew 16,669 fans to
run its home attendance to 107,-

son. The figure puts the Twins
35,266 ahead of their attendance
in Washington last year for the
