# Big Meet Picked a Toss-Up
## Russ's Recovery Makes Cal Tough 
### 
California trackmen Will be
hard pressed to run their win
streak to four this Saturday in
the Stanford-California Big Meet,
Stanford has two wins one
against Oklahoma in a triangular
against OU and San Jose State,
and last weekend’s victory over
Big Five opponent Washington
in Seattle and will be out for
victory number three of ihe sea
son.
'I’llI*; MEET is expected to he
very close again this year and
many writers have leaned a little
toward picking the Indians to win
in Saturday’s clash at Berkeley.
Cal coach Brutus Hamilton al
ways manages to come up with
a few surprises in the meet and
one may he the return of Cebron
Russ Bear hurdler and broad
jumper who could give the
Bears much need e d points in
these events.
Russ htis been out of competi
tion for several weeks due to a
knee injury but if he is ready
to go and give his best by Sat
urday Cal’s chances are im
proved.
Till'; ItEAKS come off a not
loo-impressive victory over a
makeshift Santa Clara Youth Vil
lage squad. However, Dave Mag
gard’s toss of 57-9 in Ihe shot put
places him a solid favorite in this
event.

Stanford also has a dominance
in a field event as young Dave
Weill who threw 174'8” in the
discus and Don Bell with a 169-
5 1 2 mark are rated solid favor
ites. Both men have gone 20 feel
over Cal's best mark.
AGAIN’ A 1 Gaylord should
take the two-mile event for Cal
as his times in this event have
placed him among the leaders on
tiic Coast. Phil White should win
the pole vault for the Indians and
once again narrow the point
spread in the meet.
Another factor concerning this
Saturday’s meet will be whether
Rich Klier can re()eat his last
weekend’s performance for the
Tribe thinclads. He tied for first
with John Northway in the mile
then came back to take second in
the BSO to garner much-needed
Card points.
But as for the rest of the
events, anything can happen and
once again the Big Meet should
be a thriller.
