# Fantasy Prevails in Show Knight in Arms'
## 
### SONYA MICHEL 
Sneak previews of the music, sets, and costumes for "Knight in
Arms" reveal that the play will capture the light, fairy-tale quality
of the Ondine legend.
The setting changes from a rustic fishing village to the sumptu
ous court of Herzenstein, and the fanciful underwater kingdom of

Kuhleborn, ruler of the water
sprites.
“Rather than trying to be re
alistic; or create something appro
priate to the period of the play,
wo tried to catch a mood of fan
tasy,” said May Delafield, set de
signer.
MISS DELAFIELD, a fresh
man from St. James, New York,
also worked on sets for Ram’s
Head’s Winter On Acts.
A 36-piece orchestra with a
larger-than-usual string section
carries the light mood in Hoddy
Guittard’s score. The orchestra
is the largest ever used in a
Ram s Head production.
With the orchestra, a chorus
of fishermen and villagers sings
a lively, robust drinking song in
the local tavern. Also in the score
are love duets between Ondine
and her errant knight, and the
spirited national anthem of Her
zenstein.
“THE SCORE is really more
operetta than musical comedy,”
explained composer Guittard. “I’ve
used some of the techniques de
veloped when light opera was be
ing performed more than it is
today. With this, I’ve tried to
combine certain of the expecta
tions of musical comedy.”
Also set to music are two ballet
scenes staged by Mary-Alyce. One
dance takes place in Kulileborn’s
underwater realm. The dancers
play the roles of octopi, starfish,
lobsters, and sea-horses, as well
as the lithesome nereids.
Mary-Alyce has appeared in
New York under such choregra
phers as Jerome Robbins and Ag
nes DeMille, and played in the
Broadway production of “Call Me
Madam.”
THE CURTAIN goes up on
Ram’s Head's spring fantasy Fri
day night at 8:30. Other perform
ances arc this Saturday and next
Friday and Saturday nights. 1

ances, at SI, $1.50, and $2.00 are

Head’s Winter On Acts.
A 36-piece orchestra with a
larger-than-usual string section
carries the light mood in Hoddy
Guittard’s score. The orchestra
is the largest ever used in a
Ram s Head production.
With the orchestra, a chorus
of fishermen and villagers sings
a lively, robust drinking song in
the local tavern. Also in the score
are love duets between Ondine
and her errant knight, and the
spirited national anthem of Her
zenstein.
“THE SCORE is really more
operetta than musical comedy,”
explained composer Guittard. “I’ve
used some of the techniques de
veloped when light opera was be
ing performed more than it is
today. With this, I’ve tried to
combine certain of the expecta
tions of musical comedy.”
Also set to music are two ballet
scenes staged by Mary-Alyce. One
dance takes place in Kulileborn’s
underwater realm. The dancers
play the roles of octopi, starfish,
lobsters, and sea-horses, as well
as the lithesome nereids.
Mary-Alyce has appeared in
New York under such choregra
phers as Jerome Robbins and Ag
nes DeMille, and played in the
Broadway production of “Call Me
Madam.”

“KNIGHT IN ARMS” IN REHEARSAL
Hoddy Cuittard, at the piano, runs over "Knight in Arms”
score with his co-composer Doug Johnson, who also plays
the Lord Chamberlain.
Sneak previews of the music, sets, and costumes for "Knight in
Arms" reveal that the play will capture the light, fairy-tale quality
of the Ondine legend.
The setting changes from a rustic fishing village to the sumptu
ous court of Herzenstein, and the fanciful underwater kingdom of

Kuhleborn, ruler of the water
sprites.
“Rather than trying to be re
alistic; or create something appro
priate to the period of the play,
wo tried to catch a mood of fan
tasy,” said May Delafield, set de
signer.
