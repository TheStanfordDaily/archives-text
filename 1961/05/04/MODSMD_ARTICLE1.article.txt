# Traditional East-West Dichotomy Makes Japan Campus 'Different'
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
Anyone familiar with the tra
ditional dichotomy between East
and West would expect the Stan
ford Overseas Center at Tokyo
to be unlike its European fellows,
and so it is. Stanford in Japan
differs in scope, aim and actual
physical setup from the campuses
at Stuttgart, Tours and Flor
ence.

Its purpose, as stated in the
application form, is “to improve
the educational opportunities of
a selected group of students spe
cializing in Far Eastern Affairs.”
To this end, the Tokyo Center
has been designed to achieve a
highly concentrated exposure to
Japan and to its way of life for
the few who are intensely inter
ested in such exposure.
THE NINETEEN graduate and
undergraduate students in the
first group live in Japanese dor
mitories. The men are housed in
the Wakeijuku Dormitory, an in
dependent student compound near
Waseda University. Several of i
them have Japanese roommates.
Women students arc living at
the YWCA temporarily, until
they can move into the women’s |
dorm which will he ready in Sep
tember. All of the students eat
standard Japanese student meals
in the regular dining halls, which
means mostly rice.
COURSES AT Stanford-in-Ja
pan are given by Japanese profes
sors in English. As students can 1
demonstrate adequate knowledge
of Japanese, they will be sent to j
regular classed at one of the four
universities cooperating in the!
program: Waseda, Keio, Tokyo
and the Japan Women's Univer
sity.
A minimum requirement for
acceptance is three quarters of
Japanese at St an f or d, or the
equivalent, prior to departure. At
the center itself, three hours a
day are spent in language instruc
tion, with the students divided
into four sections according to
ability.
All classes are small, ranging

from two to seven students, and
courses offered vary widely to
suit the individual student’s field
of study. Subjects range from
Japanese history, politics and
philosophy, to directed reading in
special areas.
This allows a student to con
centrate on his own interests, and
at the same time, to gain wide
experience with Japanese and
Asian culture in general.
FART OF the course of study
! will be field trips scheduled to
I Osaka and Kyoto, and to the
| northern part of the country. In
I addition, group travel is a tradi
ition among Japanese students,
and this should mean many week
end trips for the Stanford stu
dents.
The center itself consists of a
few office rooms in an unused
mansion in the Wakeijuku com
pound. Here, Dr. John D. Goheen,
head of Stanford's philosophy de
partment and present director of
the center, does the work neces
sary to setting up the program
and keeping it in operation.
Hiroshi Miyaji, who is working
toward his Ph.D. at Stanford, is
acting as Goheen’s temporary ad
ministrative assistant, and is re
sponsible for the language part
of the program. The directorship
will rotate among Stanford pro
fessors.
THE IDEA behind Stanford-in-
Tokyo grew out of a long associ
ation between Stanford and Japa
nese professors and university

I officials. During the period of
post-war reconstruction in Japan,
According to James P. Thur
ber Jr., assistant to the dean of
| the Graduate Division, who at
| tended the dedication ceremonies
and remained for two weeks ob-
I serving the operation of the cen
j ter, there is nothing like Japan.
He stressed the difficulties that
1 these students face in adjusting
| to another culture and the con
j sequent rewards for success.
“It all boils down to the stu
| dent,” he stated, “If they want to
j learn, the opportunities are there.
[ They must take advantage. If
| they do, the sky’s the limit.”
| Thurber also said that, if two
i weeks were any indication, the
I center is well on the way to be
coming quite a success.
Stanford took an active part in
1 several programs with Japanese
| universities, including two sum
mer sessions for administrators
i held here.
Then, a little over a year ago,
the Asia Foundation of San Fran
cisco financed a field trip to Ja
pan to determine the possibilities
of making Japanese study avail
able on a practical basis to Amer
ican students. The result was the
establishment of the Stanford
Center for Japanese Studies,
Tokyo.

WAKEIJUKU DORMITORY
Residence for Stanford-in-Tokyo Students


DR. JOHN D. GOHEEN
Head of Tokyo Center
Anyone familiar with the tra
ditional dichotomy between East
and West would expect the Stan
ford Overseas Center at Tokyo
to be unlike its European fellows,
and so it is. Stanford in Japan
differs in scope, aim and actual
physical setup from the campuses
at Stuttgart, Tours and Flor
ence.

Its purpose, as stated in the
application form, is “to improve
the educational opportunities of
a selected group of students spe
cializing in Far Eastern Affairs.”
To this end, the Tokyo Center
has been designed to achieve a
highly concentrated exposure to
Japan and to its way of life for
the few who are intensely inter
ested in such exposure.
THE NINETEEN graduate and
undergraduate students in the
first group live in Japanese dor
mitories. The men are housed in
the Wakeijuku Dormitory, an in
dependent student compound near
Waseda University. Several of i
them have Japanese roommates.
Women students arc living at
the YWCA temporarily, until
they can move into the women’s |
dorm which will he ready in Sep
tember. All of the students eat
standard Japanese student meals
in the regular dining halls, which
means mostly rice.
COURSES AT Stanford-in-Ja
pan are given by Japanese profes
sors in English. As students can 1
demonstrate adequate knowledge
of Japanese, they will be sent to j
regular classed at one of the four
universities cooperating in the!
program: Waseda, Keio, Tokyo
and the Japan Women's Univer
sity.
A minimum requirement for
acceptance is three quarters of
Japanese at St an f or d, or the
equivalent, prior to departure. At
the center itself, three hours a
day are spent in language instruc
tion, with the students divided
into four sections according to
ability.
All classes are small, ranging

from two to seven students, and
courses offered vary widely to
suit the individual student’s field
of study. Subjects range from
Japanese history, politics and
philosophy, to directed reading in
special areas.
This allows a student to con
centrate on his own interests, and
at the same time, to gain wide
experience with Japanese and
Asian culture in general.
FART OF the course of study
! will be field trips scheduled to
I Osaka and Kyoto, and to the
| northern part of the country. In
I addition, group travel is a tradi
ition among Japanese students,
and this should mean many week
end trips for the Stanford stu
dents.
The center itself consists of a
few office rooms in an unused
mansion in the Wakeijuku com
pound. Here, Dr. John D. Goheen,
head of Stanford's philosophy de
partment and present director of
the center, does the work neces
sary to setting up the program
and keeping it in operation.
Hiroshi Miyaji, who is working
toward his Ph.D. at Stanford, is
acting as Goheen’s temporary ad
ministrative assistant, and is re
sponsible for the language part
of the program. The directorship
will rotate among Stanford pro
fessors.
THE IDEA behind Stanford-in-
Tokyo grew out of a long associ
ation between Stanford and Japa
nese professors and university

I officials. During the period of
post-war reconstruction in Japan,
According to James P. Thur
ber Jr., assistant to the dean of
| the Graduate Division, who at
| tended the dedication ceremonies
and remained for two weeks ob-
I serving the operation of the cen
j ter, there is nothing like Japan.
He stressed the difficulties that
1 these students face in adjusting
| to another culture and the con
j sequent rewards for success.
“It all boils down to the stu
| dent,” he stated, “If they want to
j learn, the opportunities are there.
[ They must take advantage. If
| they do, the sky’s the limit.”
| Thurber also said that, if two
i weeks were any indication, the
I center is well on the way to be
coming quite a success.
Stanford took an active part in
1 several programs with Japanese
| universities, including two sum
mer sessions for administrators
i held here.

WAKEIJUKU DORMITORY
Residence for Stanford-in-Tokyo Students


DR. JOHN D. GOHEEN
Head of Tokyo Center
Anyone familiar with the tra
ditional dichotomy between East
and West would expect the Stan
ford Overseas Center at Tokyo
to be unlike its European fellows,
and so it is. Stanford in Japan
differs in scope, aim and actual
physical setup from the campuses
at Stuttgart, Tours and Flor
ence.

Its purpose, as stated in the
application form, is “to improve
the educational opportunities of
a selected group of students spe
cializing in Far Eastern Affairs.”
To this end, the Tokyo Center
has been designed to achieve a
highly concentrated exposure to
Japan and to its way of life for
the few who are intensely inter
ested in such exposure.
THE NINETEEN graduate and
undergraduate students in the
first group live in Japanese dor
mitories. The men are housed in
the Wakeijuku Dormitory, an in
dependent student compound near
Waseda University. Several of i
them have Japanese roommates.
Women students arc living at
the YWCA temporarily, until
they can move into the women’s |
dorm which will he ready in Sep
tember. All of the students eat
standard Japanese student meals
in the regular dining halls, which
means mostly rice.
COURSES AT Stanford-in-Ja
pan are given by Japanese profes
sors in English. As students can 1
demonstrate adequate knowledge
of Japanese, they will be sent to j
regular classed at one of the four
universities cooperating in the!
program: Waseda, Keio, Tokyo
and the Japan Women's Univer
sity.
A minimum requirement for
acceptance is three quarters of
Japanese at St an f or d, or the
equivalent, prior to departure. At
the center itself, three hours a
day are spent in language instruc
tion, with the students divided
into four sections according to
ability.
All classes are small, ranging

from two to seven students, and
courses offered vary widely to
suit the individual student’s field
of study. Subjects range from
Japanese history, politics and
philosophy, to directed reading in
special areas.
This allows a student to con
centrate on his own interests, and
at the same time, to gain wide
experience with Japanese and
Asian culture in general.
FART OF the course of study
! will be field trips scheduled to
I Osaka and Kyoto, and to the
| northern part of the country. In
I addition, group travel is a tradi
ition among Japanese students,
and this should mean many week
end trips for the Stanford stu
dents.
The center itself consists of a
few office rooms in an unused
mansion in the Wakeijuku com
pound. Here, Dr. John D. Goheen,
head of Stanford's philosophy de
partment and present director of
the center, does the work neces
sary to setting up the program
and keeping it in operation.
Hiroshi Miyaji, who is working
toward his Ph.D. at Stanford, is
acting as Goheen’s temporary ad
ministrative assistant, and is re
sponsible for the language part
of the program. The directorship
will rotate among Stanford pro
fessors.
THE IDEA behind Stanford-in-
Tokyo grew out of a long associ
ation between Stanford and Japa
nese professors and university

I officials. During the period of
post-war reconstruction in Japan,
According to James P. Thur
ber Jr., assistant to the dean of
| the Graduate Division, who at
| tended the dedication ceremonies
and remained for two weeks ob-
I serving the operation of the cen
j ter, there is nothing like Japan.
He stressed the difficulties that
1 these students face in adjusting
| to another culture and the con
j sequent rewards for success.
“It all boils down to the stu
| dent,” he stated, “If they want to
j learn, the opportunities are there.
[ They must take advantage. If
| they do, the sky’s the limit.”
| Thurber also said that, if two
i weeks were any indication, the
I center is well on the way to be
coming quite a success.
