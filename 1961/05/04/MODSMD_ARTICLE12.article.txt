# Ram's Head Stages Original Musical
## 
### 
It's not often that even the seasoned West Coast theater-goer has
a chance to see a premiere performance of a musical comedy, but
Stanford theater-goers will have this rare chance this weekend and
npxt when the Ram's Head Production of "Knight in Arms" opens.
This is Ram's Head's first original musical comedy since 1951
and those who have taken a sneak look will uphold our viewpoint
that this promises to be an outstanding creative experience for actors
and audience alike. The show's composers, Stanford students Doug
Johnson and Hoddy Guittard, have put together a beautiful musical
fantasy based on the Ondine legend of the v/ater sprite and her love
story with a passing medieval Knight. The songs and sets capture
tbye light, fairy tale atmosphere of the legend and the leading players
do a professional job of both acting and singing.
We are glad to see Ram's Head going back after ten years to its
primary purpose of providing students with a chance to stage their
own shows rather than performing a Broadway-proven musical. For
outside of Broadway, Stanford is one of the few places in the country
where musical theater can be createdâ€”and then produced. While
students and faculty should support this creativity, they should do
so, not out of kindness for Stanford creativity, but because we think
they will get their dollar's worth of entertainment.
