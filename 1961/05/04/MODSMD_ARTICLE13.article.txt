The San Francisco News-Call Bulletin
President Kennedy, as he said he would, has sent Congress a
draft bill laying down rules of personal conduct in the government.
This is an attempt to consolidate a hash of ancient laws into a
single, clear-cut package, updated to modern circumstances. What
W© have, as the President said, is a set of laws with good intentions
but "deficient in form and substance."
But the President's message on this subject hits the target more
accurately than legislation can. Ethics in public office is a slate of
mind, summed up by the old slogan that a "public office is a public
trust."
Occasional cases of plain venality can be dealt with by general
laws on stealing, bribery and such. But confidence in government
can be diminished as much, or more, by improprieties which do
not necessarily transgress a law. Most of the scandals in Washing
ton in late years—from the "deep freezes" to the Sherman Adams
debacle— have stemmed from the lack of understanding of sound
moral behavior rather than deliberate corruption.
"The ultimate answer to ethical problems in government," said
the President, is "honest people in good ethical environment. No
web of statute or regulation, however intricately conceived, can
hope to deal with the myriad possible challenges to a man's integrity
or his devotion to the public interest."
As Mr. Kennedy recognized in his message, the "gravest re
sponsibility of all" rests on the President. He can set the tone, by the
type of men he appoints, by insisting on the type of conduct he
espouses.
