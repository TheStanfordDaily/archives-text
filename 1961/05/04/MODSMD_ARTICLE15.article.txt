## Cuba Invasion a Strategic Error, Showing Presidential Bungle 
### 
President Kennedy i; in grave
trouble. If, afier the appalling
mistake of judgment in the Cuban
venture, ho allows himself to he
sucked into the quicksands of
Laos, he will have compromised,
perhaps irrevocably, his influence
on events. For the more lie en
gages himself directly while the
Soviet Union and China keep a
free hand, the more he will weak
en his intluence.

I The disaster in
(Cuba has opened
the way to Chi-
II e u e diplomatic
intervention i n
the Laotian ne
gotiations. An
American mili
tary entangle
in en t in Laos
would not only
I tpen the way to
Chinese military

intervention hut would greatly
aggravate the pressure on Iran,
on Quomoy and Matsu, and on
our other exposed and vulnerable
outposts, including pr ob ah 1 y
West Berlin.
THU UN IT FI) ST A TKS would
have committed the cardinal stra
tegic error of dispersing its forces
at places where there can be no
decision while its adversary kept
his forces concentrated and intact.
Though it is late, it is, let us
hope, not too late to find our way
hack to the highway from which
we have strayed.
To do this there will have to be
a certain inquiry, which only the
President can conduct, followed
by a frank and convincing ex
planation of how so colossal a
mistake was made.
TICK QUESTION is how the
President decided to approve this
venture which was, as the event
has shown, so greatly miscon
ceived. As I understand it, and
pnntrarv fn thn (Tonoi'nl imnvnc.

.'-ion, there was no serious expec
tation that the landing of the ex
lies would he followed immedi
ately by a political uprising
againsl Castro. The object of the
landing was to establish a beach
head for a civil war against Cas
tro.
Bad as have been the conse
quences ol the failure, they are
probably less bad than would
have been the indecisive partial
success which was the best that
could conceivably have been
achieved. For in order to support
the rebellion in Cuba we would
have had to continue to violate
not only our treaties with the
oilier American stales hut also
our own laws which prohibit the
preparation of foreign military
expeditions in the United States.
My own inquiries as to how the
misjudgment was made lead me
to believe that the President was
not protected by the New Hands
-Bundy, Rostow, Schlesinger,
and Rusk against the bad advice
of the Old Hands, Bussell and
Dulles of the CIA. Lemnitzer and
Burke of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and Berle of the State Depart
ment. There is no doubt that the
plans had been drawn up and the
preparations made during the
preceding Administration. There
is no doubt that the President in
sisted upon modifying these plans
to avoid, as he thought and hoped,
any appearance of direct involve
ment of the United Slates Armed
Forces. Though much has been
said that this proviso ruined the
plan, there is no doubt also that
ihe Chiefs of St,iff and the CIA
advised the President to proceed
nevertheless.
I BKLLLVE an inquiry will
show that the Secretary of State,
although he had his misgivings,
approved the plan. Contrary to
innnh lh;*l line cuirl f l-\r>lin\'c»

it to be true that Stevenson and
Bowles were excluded from the
deliberations whiclr preceded the
fatal decision.
Furthermore, the record will
show, I believe, that the one man
who participated in the delibera
tions and pleaded with the Presi
dent not to approve the plan was
Sen. Fulbrlght. He foresaw what
would happen, he warned the
President that the right policy
was not to attempt to oust Castro
but to contain him while we
worked constructively in Latin
America. Sen. Fulbright was the
only wise man in the lot.
When there is a disaster of this
kind as for example the British
disaster at Suez the mistake can
Ire purged and confidence can be
restored only by the resignation
of the key figures who had the
primary responsibility and by
candid talk which offers the
promise that the mistake will not
be repeated.
IN THE immediate wake of the
disaster the President took the
position that he would accept all
j the blame and that nobody else
was to be held responsible. This
| was generous. It was brave, and
in the sense that the Chief Execu
tive must stand by those under
him, it was right. But it is not
the whole story. Under our sys
| tern of government, unlike the
British system, the Chief Execu
tive who makes a great mistake
does not and cannot resign. There
j fore, if there is to be accountabil-
I ity in our government, the Presi
dent must hold responsible those
i whose constitutional or statutory
j duty it is to advise him.
All this is a painful business,
| even for a hardened newspaper
writer. But the stakes are very
high and the national interest is
that the truth be found and that
justice be done. For there is at
stake the confidence of our own
people and of our friends through
out the world.

President Kennedy i; in grave
trouble. If, afier the appalling
mistake of judgment in the Cuban
venture, ho allows himself to he
sucked into the quicksands of
Laos, he will have compromised,
perhaps irrevocably, his influence
on events. For the more lie en
gages himself directly while the
Soviet Union and China keep a
free hand, the more he will weak
en his intluence.

I The disaster in
(Cuba has opened
the way to Chi-
II e u e diplomatic
intervention i n
the Laotian ne
gotiations. An
American mili
tary entangle
in en t in Laos
would not only
I tpen the way to
Chinese military

intervention hut would greatly
aggravate the pressure on Iran,
on Quomoy and Matsu, and on
our other exposed and vulnerable
outposts, including pr ob ah 1 y
West Berlin.
THU UN IT FI) ST A TKS would
have committed the cardinal stra
tegic error of dispersing its forces
at places where there can be no
decision while its adversary kept
his forces concentrated and intact.
Though it is late, it is, let us
hope, not too late to find our way
hack to the highway from which
we have strayed.
To do this there will have to be
a certain inquiry, which only the
President can conduct, followed
by a frank and convincing ex
planation of how so colossal a
mistake was made.
TICK QUESTION is how the
President decided to approve this
venture which was, as the event
has shown, so greatly miscon
ceived. As I understand it, and
pnntrarv fn thn (Tonoi'nl imnvnc.

.'-ion, there was no serious expec
tation that the landing of the ex
lies would he followed immedi
ately by a political uprising
againsl Castro. The object of the
landing was to establish a beach
head for a civil war against Cas
tro.
Bad as have been the conse
quences ol the failure, they are
probably less bad than would
have been the indecisive partial
success which was the best that
could conceivably have been
achieved. For in order to support
the rebellion in Cuba we would
have had to continue to violate
not only our treaties with the
oilier American stales hut also
our own laws which prohibit the
preparation of foreign military
expeditions in the United States.
My own inquiries as to how the
misjudgment was made lead me
to believe that the President was
not protected by the New Hands
-Bundy, Rostow, Schlesinger,
and Rusk against the bad advice
of the Old Hands, Bussell and
Dulles of the CIA. Lemnitzer and
Burke of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and Berle of the State Depart
ment. There is no doubt that the
plans had been drawn up and the
preparations made during the
preceding Administration. There
is no doubt that the President in
sisted upon modifying these plans
to avoid, as he thought and hoped,
any appearance of direct involve
ment of the United Slates Armed
Forces. Though much has been
said that this proviso ruined the
plan, there is no doubt also that
ihe Chiefs of St,iff and the CIA
advised the President to proceed
nevertheless.
I BKLLLVE an inquiry will
show that the Secretary of State,
although he had his misgivings,
approved the plan. Contrary to
innnh lh;*l line cuirl f l-\r>lin\'c»

it to be true that Stevenson and
Bowles were excluded from the
deliberations whiclr preceded the
fatal decision.
Furthermore, the record will
show, I believe, that the one man
who participated in the delibera
tions and pleaded with the Presi
dent not to approve the plan was
Sen. Fulbrlght. He foresaw what
would happen, he warned the
President that the right policy
was not to attempt to oust Castro
but to contain him while we
worked constructively in Latin
America. Sen. Fulbright was the
only wise man in the lot.
When there is a disaster of this
kind as for example the British
disaster at Suez the mistake can
Ire purged and confidence can be
restored only by the resignation
of the key figures who had the
primary responsibility and by
candid talk which offers the
promise that the mistake will not
be repeated.
IN THE immediate wake of the
disaster the President took the
position that he would accept all
j the blame and that nobody else
was to be held responsible. This
| was generous. It was brave, and
in the sense that the Chief Execu
tive must stand by those under
him, it was right. But it is not
the whole story. Under our sys
| tern of government, unlike the
British system, the Chief Execu
tive who makes a great mistake
does not and cannot resign. There
j fore, if there is to be accountabil-
I ity in our government, the Presi
dent must hold responsible those
i whose constitutional or statutory
j duty it is to advise him.
All this is a painful business,
| even for a hardened newspaper
writer. But the stakes are very
high and the national interest is
that the truth be found and that
justice be done. For there is at
stake the confidence of our own
people and of our friends through
out the world.

President Kennedy i; in grave
trouble. If, afier the appalling
mistake of judgment in the Cuban
venture, ho allows himself to he
sucked into the quicksands of
Laos, he will have compromised,
perhaps irrevocably, his influence
on events. For the more lie en
gages himself directly while the
Soviet Union and China keep a
free hand, the more he will weak
en his intluence.

I The disaster in
(Cuba has opened
the way to Chi-
II e u e diplomatic
intervention i n
the Laotian ne
gotiations. An
American mili
tary entangle
in en t in Laos
would not only
I tpen the way to
Chinese military

intervention hut would greatly
aggravate the pressure on Iran,
on Quomoy and Matsu, and on
our other exposed and vulnerable
outposts, including pr ob ah 1 y
West Berlin.
THU UN IT FI) ST A TKS would
have committed the cardinal stra
tegic error of dispersing its forces
at places where there can be no
decision while its adversary kept
his forces concentrated and intact.
Though it is late, it is, let us
hope, not too late to find our way
hack to the highway from which
we have strayed.
To do this there will have to be
a certain inquiry, which only the
President can conduct, followed
by a frank and convincing ex
planation of how so colossal a
mistake was made.
TICK QUESTION is how the
President decided to approve this
venture which was, as the event
has shown, so greatly miscon
ceived. As I understand it, and
pnntrarv fn thn (Tonoi'nl imnvnc.

.'-ion, there was no serious expec
tation that the landing of the ex
lies would he followed immedi
ately by a political uprising
againsl Castro. The object of the
landing was to establish a beach
head for a civil war against Cas
tro.
Bad as have been the conse
quences ol the failure, they are
probably less bad than would
have been the indecisive partial
success which was the best that
could conceivably have been
achieved. For in order to support
the rebellion in Cuba we would
have had to continue to violate
not only our treaties with the
oilier American stales hut also
our own laws which prohibit the
preparation of foreign military
expeditions in the United States.
My own inquiries as to how the
misjudgment was made lead me
to believe that the President was
not protected by the New Hands
-Bundy, Rostow, Schlesinger,
and Rusk against the bad advice
of the Old Hands, Bussell and
Dulles of the CIA. Lemnitzer and
Burke of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and Berle of the State Depart
ment. There is no doubt that the
plans had been drawn up and the
preparations made during the
preceding Administration. There
is no doubt that the President in
sisted upon modifying these plans
to avoid, as he thought and hoped,
any appearance of direct involve
ment of the United Slates Armed
Forces. Though much has been
said that this proviso ruined the
plan, there is no doubt also that
ihe Chiefs of St,iff and the CIA
advised the President to proceed
nevertheless.
I BKLLLVE an inquiry will
show that the Secretary of State,
although he had his misgivings,
approved the plan. Contrary to
innnh lh;*l line cuirl f l-\r>lin\'c»

it to be true that Stevenson and
Bowles were excluded from the
deliberations whiclr preceded the
fatal decision.
Furthermore, the record will
show, I believe, that the one man
who participated in the delibera
tions and pleaded with the Presi
dent not to approve the plan was
Sen. Fulbrlght. He foresaw what
would happen, he warned the
President that the right policy
was not to attempt to oust Castro
but to contain him while we
worked constructively in Latin
America. Sen. Fulbright was the
only wise man in the lot.
When there is a disaster of this
kind as for example the British
disaster at Suez the mistake can
Ire purged and confidence can be
restored only by the resignation
of the key figures who had the
primary responsibility and by
candid talk which offers the
promise that the mistake will not
be repeated.
IN THE immediate wake of the
disaster the President took the
position that he would accept all
j the blame and that nobody else
was to be held responsible. This
| was generous. It was brave, and
in the sense that the Chief Execu
tive must stand by those under
him, it was right. But it is not
the whole story. Under our sys
| tern of government, unlike the
British system, the Chief Execu
tive who makes a great mistake
does not and cannot resign. There
j fore, if there is to be accountabil-
I ity in our government, the Presi
dent must hold responsible those
i whose constitutional or statutory
j duty it is to advise him.
All this is a painful business,
| even for a hardened newspaper
writer. But the stakes are very
high and the national interest is
that the truth be found and that
justice be done. For there is at
stake the confidence of our own
people and of our friends through
out the world.
