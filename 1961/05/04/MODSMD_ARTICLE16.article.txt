# Finishing Kick

Stanford Frosh Could Be Number One

Thi-s weekend the sports spotlight will undoubtedly fall on the
Big Meet where Coach Payton Jordan’s highly trained crew will be
trying to prevent California from running up its fourth straight vic
tory in the cross-bay series. But running concurrently with the var
sity Stanford’s surprising freshman spikers will be bidding for the
number-one ranking nationally as they square off against the Cal
Frosh.

As the season opened, the Papooses, boasting an outstanding crop
of prep stars, were ranked second in the nation by Track and Field
Magazine. Last weekend they romped over the supposed number-one
team, San Jose State, by a decisive 79-52 margin. In view of this,
perhaps we would not be stretching objectivity too far if we were
now to claim for them that number-one rating.

THE MAKEUP of a champion
ship track team, and a national
champion at that, is more than
just a lot of prep super-stars as
the Track and Field poll would
seem to indicate. Coach Jordan
is the first to point out that the
depth, the second and third place
guys, are equally as important to
a top-flight team.
This year’s frosh have both.
The high-scoring stars include two
freshman record holders, Steve
Arch and Bill Pratt, and team
captain Robin Rukle. Arch’s rec
ord-shattering toss in the shot put
against San Francisco State and
Contra Costa JC was 52-8, but last
week he was out to 54-Vi only to
finish second to the '6O prep
champ Pat Kelso of SJS.
Ruble, rated last year by Scho
lastic Coach Magazine as the fin
est middle distance runner in the

country, has not yet gotten down to his high school times, but is
coming along fast. Ruble also was under his best last week when
turned the mile in 4:19.4 which was good for third place in the
fast field. Ho has been a constant winner in the half with a best
time of 1:56.
A REALLY PLEASANT surprise for Coaches Jordan and Jim
ter rill this year has been Pratt, who justified their confidence fully
last week when he ol’pped six-tenths of a second off the standing
school record as he covered the mile in 4:15.7. Pratt also holds the
380 marl; wl.k h he set earlier in the year at 1:54.3. Add to this trio
Rich Choserek and Steve Cortright, who have been doubling all sea
son long in the sprints and hurdles respectively, and we come up
with a solid, high scoring nucleus to go with the necessary depth
the Papooses have shown.
But in Jordan’s track philosophy there is a third factor every
bit as important in its own way as the primary two. He calls it
“collective unity and enthusiasm” and credits to it the difference
between a good team and a great team.

'Unify, Enthusiasm' Make the Difference

Now, to the average track fan sitting high atop the Stadium rim
the closest semblance to team work is the split-second passing of
the baton among the four relay men. But Jordan’s “collective unity”
is a kind of team work and team spirit all rolled into one. It is the
feeling he instills in his athletes that the important thing is the Stan
ford point total and the team performance, not their own.
It is that certain something that prompted Craig Barrett to un
hesitantly enter four events against Washington last weekend even
though it might have meant that he couldn’t go quite as far in his
specialty, the broad jump. As a result he added 12 points to the
team total rather than the three or five he might otherwise have
tallied. And, we might add, it’s no secret that Barrett’s performance
was largely responsible for the Indians’ close win.
THAT SAME SPIRIT was even more apparent in Ernie Cunliffe
last year when he willingly doubled and sometimes tripled, knowing
full well that every time he ran the mile first, his chances for any
record in his specialty, the 880, were nil.
In short it was that “consciousness and fierce competition” of
pulling together that enabled guys like Handsel Minyard, Clayton
Raaka, Cortright and Cheserek to come through and help beat a
team they shouldn’t have, the two coaches agreed.
And, although it can be argued that this “spirit” or “collective
unity” is a minimum factor when weighed against sheer personnel,
we are reminded that the Washington track meet was decided by
the three-feet that separated the anchor men in the final relay, a
minimum distance indeed.

For those avid track fans who were alarmed to find Rich Klier’s
name among the list of patients at the Men’s Rest Home in Mon
day's Daily, rest easy. Rich was only there for a rest after his tax
ing performance in Seattle. He had become so worked up that he
couldn’t sleep, according to Jordan. However, he has been working
out since Tuesday and is expected to be up for the big one at Cal
Saturday.
