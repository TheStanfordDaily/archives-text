# Golden Bears Blue, Face Indian Threat
## 
### 
University of California’s thin
track squad will have to come up
with some all-time bests if they’re
to continue their domination over
the Stanford Indians when the
two teams meet this Saturday on
the Golden Bear’s track.
THE HOST cindormcn beat
Santa Clara Youth Village, 76-51,
last week in preparation for the

Cards but outstanding individual
performances were few and far
between.

One of the top marks turned in
by the East Bay Bears was Bob
Karlsrud’s 48.3 in the quarter
mile—a full second and a half
faster than Stanford’s best 440
the same weekend, a 49.8 run by
Rich Parker against Washington.
Karlsrud doubled by covering
the 220 around one turn and in
a nine-mile wind in 21.7 which is

better than the Farm sprinters
usually do.
El) DONAHUE cleared 6-4 in
the SCYV meet to tie for second

and he poses a formidable chal
lenge to Stanford’s John Fontius
and Don Bell, both of whom often j
are in the 6-0 to 6-2 region.
The mile could turn out to be
quite a battle. Woody Covington
toured the four-lap grind in 4:19.8
for the Berkeleyites last week and
he was followed closely by team
males George Linn, who ran a
4:20.1, and Gary Walton, who was
clocked in 4:21.5.
Stanford distance men John
Northway and Rich Klier had
similar times against the Huskies
as both were caught in 4:18.4 in
a first place tie.

The 880 produced the only other
top Cal marks, Marty Ziebarth
running a 1:54.3 and Rich San
ford a 1:54.8.
