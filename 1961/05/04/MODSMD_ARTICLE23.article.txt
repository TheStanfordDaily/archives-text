# Frosh Hit Four Homers, Win
## 
### 
Four home runs, two by Bob
Hollman and one each by Tom
May and Jim Seckler, allowed the
frosh baseball team to overcome
a five-run deficit and beat the
Santa Clara Broncs, 8-6, in an 11-
inning fray yesterday at Stan
ford.
Jack Wood got credit for the
win, hurling the final 6 2/3 in
nings and allowing just one hit.
