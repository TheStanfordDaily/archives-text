# Women's Housing Drawing Today
## 
### 
Drawing for women’s housing
will be held today, from 9-4:30 in
the Women’s Club House rather
than yesterday as previously re
ported in the Daily.
All freshman women, except
those going overseas in Juno or
September, along with sophomore
or junior women wishing to
change residences, will draw. Up
perclass women may drop out of
the drawing on Friday if they
wish.
