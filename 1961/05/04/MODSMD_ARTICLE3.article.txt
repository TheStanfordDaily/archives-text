# RIOT TRIAL
## Jury Finds UC Senior 'Not Guilty' 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) A
jury yesterday found University
of California senior Robert Mei
senbach innocent in an assault
case arising out of last year’s city
hall riots against the House Com
mittee on Unamerican Activities.
Meisenbach, 23, was one of 64
persons arrested May 13. 1960.
during violence which broke out
when 150 persons, most of them
students, were refused admittance
into the committee's hearing room
and were forced from the city hall
by police armed wtih fire hoses.
Charges were dismissed against
all those arrested except Mcisen
bach, who was accused of taking
a police officer’s club away from
him and hitting the officer on the
head with it.

During the two-week trial in
! Superior Judge Harry J, Neu
j barth’s court, contradictory testi
j mony was presented by prosecu
j tion and defense witnesses. Mei
senbach denied that he attacked
I Officer Ralph E. Schaumleffel
and accused police of beating him.
PROSECUTION witnesses con
tradicted each other in accounts
} of the “beating” that the officer
I received.

, Schaumleffel said that he was !
i struck behind the left ear, wit- |
I nesses said the blow was on the j
right side. The officer said he !
i was hit once, supporting wit- j
j nesses saw two or three blows, i
j Schaumleffel said both he and |
j Meisenbach fell, while a leading j
prosecution witness reported that '
both stayed upright.
THE CITY HALL riots re
I ceived worldwide attention and j
| were the subject of a controver
sial film, "Operation Abolition,” j
which was made from seized:
newsreel film. Editors of the film |
were accused of presenting a false i
over-all picture of the incidents, j
The debate centered around I
whether the riot was Communist- j
inspired and directed, or a spon- j
taneous demonstration by stu
dents.
The jury deliberated 2V 2 hours '
before announcing its verdict. It |
was greeted by a cheering crowd j
of spectators in the courtroom, j
largely students.
"Down deep I always felt I !
would be acquitted and that jus- j
tice would result,” Meisenbach 1
said.
Defense attorney Jack Berman
said the verdict “knocks ‘Opera
tion Abolition’ into the creek”
and was a “direct blow” to the
House committee.
