# Rebels Ignore Laotian 'Truce'
## 
### 
VIENTIANE, La os (U PI)
Rebel Laotian forces ignored
cease-fire appeals by their own
leaders yesterday and launched
heavy new attacks in southern
Laos. Communist units broke a
local cease-fire agreement north
of Vientiane Tuesday night.
Both the Communist Pathet
Lao guerrillas and leftwing army
forces under Paratroop Capt.
Kong Le called on their forces in
the Laotian civil war to cease mil
itary operations as of 8 a.m. (6
p.m. PDT Tuesday).
The first evidence of Commu
nist bad faith came in the Ban
Him Heup area 50 miles north of
Vientiane where a local cease fire
had been in effect since Monday,
Communist Pathet Lao troops
opened a heavy mortar attack on
the government command post
there Tuesday right.
Despite the Communist attacks,
the defense ministry said the
royal truce team would continue
trying to meet with the rebels.
