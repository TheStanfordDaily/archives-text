# Please Send Lizzie a Card
## 
### 
Like women, newspaper
presses must he coaxed and
teased into satisfying your
desires. They're unpredicta
ble. Sometimes you just can’t
do anything with them.
That’s the way things are
at The Daily right now. Our
friendly press, Little Lizzie,
just doesn’t want to go. She
stopped during yesterday’s
press run. Nobody knows
why—but we’re trying to find
out. We’re teasing, begging
and coaxing. We’re trying to
get Liz to cooperate.
With luck we’ll be back on
speaking terms tomorrow.
But until W'e are, Liz’s cousin
at the Menlo Park Recorder
is giving us a hand—for
money, of course. It's strictly
a business deal, for our heart
still belongs to Liz. No one
could quite replace her.
“Get Well” cards will be ap
preciated.
