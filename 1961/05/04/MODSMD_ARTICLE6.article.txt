# Assignment: Write a Song
## 
### 
(To the tune of "Sons ol the Stanford Red")
Sons of the Stanford Red,
Here is a jolt for you—on.
Write fifty words in the lyric
style,
Send them to Professor Herbert
Nanney, room 825 at the Knoll as
soon as possible.
Composer Strabo V. Claggett
has submitted copies of a march
ing song he wrote during World
War 1 to Stanford and Harvard.
He plans to award legal title to
the music to the university that
writes the best set of campus
song lyrics. The successful lyri
cist will become co-composer of
the song with Mr. Claggett.
Early in April, Harvard’s Hasty
Pudding Club sang their suggest
ed lyrics for composer Claggett
who described them as “good
words.”
Better words may be submitted
to Professor Nanney, who has
copies of the music.
