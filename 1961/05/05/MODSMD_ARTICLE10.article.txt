# LASSU Okays Manne, Previn Jazz Program
## 
### JERRY RANKIN, Managing Editor 
The jazz music of the Andre Previn Trio and Shelley Manne
and his Men will fill Frost Amphitheater May 28 as a result of
Legislature's giving the go-ahead last night to the Africa Desk
sponsored program.
LASSU granted its approval after a thorough scrutiny of the

plans for the HR show, and on
the condition that sufficient un
derwriting be obtained to cover
expenses if the show for some
reason is not successful.
Profits from the show, accord
ing to chairman 'l’om Bailard.
would go toward setting up an
exchange of students between
Stanford and African universities.
WHILE THE exchange cannot
be established for the next school
year, the Africa Desk would hold
any money it made from the jazz
program for use in the exchange,
which it now hopes to have going
for the 1962-63 school year.
Bailard said the program would
be at 2 p.m. May 28, which is the
Sunday of the last week before
dead week. He declared that if
just 1,000 tickets are sold, Africa
Desk still could make money.
He indicated that he expects a
much larger crowd. Frost’s ca
pacity is 10,000. While he didn’t
hope to draw that large a crowd,
he was optimistic about luring
several thousand jazz enthusiasts
to the show.
A FEW LASSU members sug
gested the program might not go
over, but after hearing the de
tailed plans already made regard
ing police, publicily, ticket sale,
and financial arrangements, the
legislators okayed the project.
Bailard pointed out that he can
get Manne and Previn for a total
of $1,900 instead of the $4,000 the
two groups would normally re
ceive for such a performance.
He said the desk does not ex
pect to sell more than about 1,500
tickets to Stanford students—
based on past experience with
end-of-spring-quarter shows—but
does anticipate a large ticket sale
among high and other college stu
dents on the Peninsula, jazz fans
throughout the Bay Area and the
general public.
IN OTHER matters, the group
headed into the first of several
sessions on next year’s budgets
for ASSU organizations.
Sitting as committee of the
whole—a parliamentary move to
provide for freer discussion—
LASSU approved six budgets.
When all of next year’s budgets
have been gone over in committee
of the whole, LASSU will convene
in regular session and make the
final decisions on how much
money each ASSU group will get
next year, and presumably will go
along with what it decides in
committee of the whole meetings.
THE FOLLOWING budgets
were given tentative approval last
night:
Associated Women’s Students—
s63s; Foreign Scholarship Com
mission, $9,489.50; Elections Com
mission—-$770; Cardinals Board—
sl,oss; Hostel Board $470; Rally
Commission —$1,735; Student-Fac
ulty Commission $7O.
Increases from this year’s budg
ets were recommended for the fol
lowing groups:
Foreign Scholarship Commis
sion $1,000; Elections Commis
sion $382; Rally Commission—
s2B2.
THE ONLY real disagreement
on any of the budgets came when
some members questioned the
value of the Daily’s election sup
plement, and it was moved to
strike provision for supplements
next fall and spring from thei
Election Commission budget.
After many members said they
felt the supplement was valuable
in informing students about the
candidates and in generating a
larger voting turnout, however,
LASSU approved the money for i
next year’s supplements. , j
