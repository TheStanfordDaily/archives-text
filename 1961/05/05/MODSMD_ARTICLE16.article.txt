# JOURNEY TO BERKELEY
## Spikers Test Cal in 'Big One’ 
### 
BY KEN DERY, Sports Editor
Trying to even the score for the fall "Big One", the Stanford track
team meets arch-rival California tomorrow afternoon at 1:00 p.m. at
Berkeley.
The sparkling Card frosh take on the Bear frosh at 11:00, also

across the Bay.
COACH Payt on Jordan watched
his squad, yesterday, fresh off a
stunning upset of Washington,
and said, “I’m sure it will be a
close meet. The guys are physi
cally and mentally ready and you
can bet we’ll give it all we’ve got.”
Rich Klior, ace half miler, is
feeling fine after a day’s relaxa
tion in the rest home and will
run his specialty, in addition to
the mile relay.
The junior co-captain was so
emotionally drained after last
week’s test in Seattle that he
couldn’t let down and was unable
to sleep.
Discus throwers Don Bell and
Dave Weil! arc also in top shape,
and they have been steady point
earners, week after week.
SO FAB sophomore Weill (6-7,
2701 has the better mark of the
two with a 175-foot heave, but
Bell is not far behind having spun
the plate 171-11. The two have
proven to be tough when it counts
and may come up with their best
marks ever tomorrow.
Mr. Versatility, Craig Barrett,
will see yeoman service per usual.
He is entered in the 100-yard
dash, the high hurdles, the low
hurdles and the broad jump. Bar
rett tallied 12 big points last week
against the Huskies.
The broad jump is expected to
be dominated by Stanford mostly
because of Dan Moore. Moore, a
sophomore from Salem, Oregon,

has leaped 25-1 and is running
smoothly after a leg injury which
sidelined him last year.
FOR THE Bears the big ques
tion mark seems to be Cebron
Russ. Russ, who won both the

low and high hurdles and finished
second to John Kelly in the broad
jump last year when the Bears
scored a 72 1/3-58 2/3 upset at
Palo Alto, is Cal’s big man. With
out him the Bears’ chances of giv
ing Payton Jordan his fourth con
secutive loss in the cross-bay
series will be greatly reduced.
