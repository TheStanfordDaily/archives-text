The Big Five tracksters suc
cessfully assaulted several rec
ords in action last weekend. Out
standing efforts included a seven
foot high jump, the nation’s best
400 meter hurdles lime, a 15-foot
pole vault and a collegiate record
mile relay.
The relay record was turned in
by USC. The Trojans broke the
old record of 3:07.9 of which they
were a co-holder with a clocking
of 3:07.6. This is just two seconds
off the world record set by a 1960
U.S. Olympic foursome.

the first and only U.S. high
jumper to make the magic 7 foot
height this season. He topped an
even seven feet in the Mt. San
Antonio Relays.
The 15-foot vault belongs to
Washington’s consistent sopho
more John Cramer. He topped
15%, an inch off his season’s best.
He has now hit 15 feet or more
four times this year.
Rex Cawley, outstanding SC
sophomore who already holds the
nation’s best low hurdles time and
held the best 440 time until Sat
urday, ran the 400-meter hurdles
in 50.6 to take the national lead
in that event too.
OTHER outstanding perform
ances wore a 9.5 hundred yard
dash by Bruce Munn of USC, al
though he ran with the aid of a
strong wind, and a new California
school record of 57-9 in the shot
put by Dave Maggard.
Dallas Long, the only collegiate
shot putter to exceed 60 feet this
season, did it again this weekend
with a 61-9% put.
The Big Five’s national bests
this week include the mile relay,
shot put, 400-moter hurdles, low
hurdles and high jump.
Twelve of the fifteen marks set
in the 1960 AAWU track meet
have already been bettered this
year. The only three not topped
are the mile, the 880 and the jave
lin.
