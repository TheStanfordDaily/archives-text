# First U.S. Space Trip Set Today
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(UPI) America’s first space
flight was scheduled to "go” early
this morning.
That was the word yesterday
from the weather man, from
"prime astronaut” Alan B. Shep
ard Jr., from his Mercury-Red
stone rocket and cabin combina
tion, and from officials of the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration (NASA).
The word was relayed by Lt.
Col. John H. Powers, information
officer for NASA’s Mercury man
in-space project. Unless the
weather turns sour again, or
something else unguessable hap
pens, Shepard was scheduled to
leap 115 miles into space and 290
miles down the Atlantic missile
range at. around 5 a.m. PDT.
DOCTORS have pronounced the
37-year-old Shepard in "superb
condition” for his mission. And
at a news briefing Powers told
reporters:
“The weather man tells us that
it looks like the weather will be
clear enough for us to go ... the
chances are better than 50-50 in
our book that we can got off the
launching before the weather
worsens.”
Subsequent reports said weath
er conditions were steadily im
proving for a flight today.
BUT ANOTHER spell of bad
weather is on the way. There
were indications that if Shepard
didn’t got off today, his flight
may have to be postponed several
(lays.
Powers said yesterday “the
weather looks good up to noon
tomorrow” but that the outlook is
“less encouraging for the week
end.”
“If we don’t get off Friday,” he
said, “we will have to take a long,
hard look at the situation.”
AS FOB THE 33-ton Redstone
rocket, “she performed beauti
fully with no difficulties” in a
number of simulated flights
Wednesday, Powers said, and in
side the ton-and-a-half Mercury
spacecraft “everything is now
working in perfect order.”
Powers’ optimism about the
weather, which went bad and
forced postponement of the shot
on Tuesday, stemmed from fore
casts which indicated wind, cloud,
and wave conditions would be
well within the specifications de
creed by NASA for the flight.

Col. John H. Powers, information
officer for NASA’s Mercury man
in-space project. Unless the
weather turns sour again, or
something else unguessable hap
pens, Shepard was scheduled to
leap 115 miles into space and 290
miles down the Atlantic missile
range at. around 5 a.m. PDT.
DOCTORS have pronounced the
37-year-old Shepard in "superb
condition” for his mission. And
at a news briefing Powers told
reporters:
“The weather man tells us that
it looks like the weather will be
clear enough for us to go ... the
chances are better than 50-50 in
our book that we can got off the
launching before the weather
worsens.”
Subsequent reports said weath
er conditions were steadily im
proving for a flight today.
BUT ANOTHER spell of bad
weather is on the way. There
were indications that if Shepard
didn’t got off today, his flight
may have to be postponed several
(lays.
Powers said yesterday “the
weather looks good up to noon
tomorrow” but that the outlook is
“less encouraging for the week
end.”
“If we don’t get off Friday,” he
said, “we will have to take a long,
hard look at the situation.”
AS FOB THE 33-ton Redstone
rocket, “she performed beauti
fully with no difficulties” in a
number of simulated flights
Wednesday, Powers said, and in
side the ton-and-a-half Mercury
spacecraft “everything is now
working in perfect order.”
Powers’ optimism about the
weather, which went bad and
forced postponement of the shot
on Tuesday, stemmed from fore
casts which indicated wind, cloud,
and wave conditions would be
well within the specifications de
creed by NASA for the flight.
