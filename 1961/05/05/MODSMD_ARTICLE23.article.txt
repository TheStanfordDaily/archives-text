# Golfers Meet SJS, UCLA
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity golfers
will be after their eighth and
ninth wins in a row this weekend
as they host the San Jose Spar
tans today and the UCLA Bruins
tomorrow.
LAST Ut.llK the Cards dumped
USC, 20'j-GU, to remove a major!
obstacle between them and the
AAWU title, and a victory over
the Baby Blue would virtually
clinch the Big Five championship
for the locals.
Western Intercollegiate cham
pion John Lotz of SJS will pro
vide the big threat to Coach Bud
Finger’s men in today’s match.
However, in an earlier meeting
this year between the two schools,
Card number one man Bill Parish
downed Lotz, 3-0, to lead Stanford
to a 20-7 win over the southerners.
BACKING up Farish will be
Kent Winton, who plays in the
second slot and tied for medalist
honors against SC with a one
over par 73, and Phil Underwood,
who beat his SJS foe last week
and shot a 66 over the San Jose
Country Club layout for low
score.
Other starters will be sopho
more Bill Welch, Steve Smith,
who won both of his matches

against the Sparts and Trojans,
and sophomore Dave Munro. who
has been a consistent winner as
number six man.
