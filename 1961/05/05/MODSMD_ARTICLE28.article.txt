# Students' Art To Be Shown At Annual Exhibit in Gallery
## 
### 
The annual exhibition of art
created by Stanford students will
open tomorrow at the University
Art Gallery.

The entries cover the range of
Hie art department’s work: fab
rics, graphic design and art. kites,
canvases of all sizes, water colors,
drawings, models, architectural
renderings, functional designs
and sculpture.
Prof, Matt Kahn, in charge of
assembling the show, reports that
"rather than arbitrarily cutting
the exhibition down to size,” he
is going to try to show it all. “It
seems in keeping with the state
of the department,” he said,
“bursting at the seams. As the
department is, so should the
show be.”

A yearly event for the past 20-
25 years, the show not only em
phasizes quality, according to
Prof. Edward M. Farmer, acting
head of the department, but also
will present as wide a cross sec

tion of student work as possible.
The show will run through May
28. Admittance to the Gallery is
free, and hours are 10 a.m. to 5
p.m, from Tuesday through Sat
urday, and noon to 4 p.m. on Sun
days. Some of the exhibited works
are for sale.
