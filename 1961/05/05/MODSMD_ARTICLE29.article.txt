# Seniors Count In Grad Survey
## 
### 
A select group of Stanford sen
iors will participate next week in
a nation-wide study of the rela
tionship between college experi
ence and the future plans of col
lege graduates.
The students are asked to fill
out questionnaires to provide in
formation regarding the number
of graduating students who will
go on to graduate study and of
those who intend to go directly
into business and other careers.
The study also expects to deter
mine the influences that led stu
dents to make their choices.
The study, under the joint spon
sorship of the Office of Education,
the National Institute of Health,
and the National Science Founda
tion, is under the direction of the
National Opinion Research Cen
ter, a non-profit organization affil
iated with the University of Chi
cago.
Wendy Goebel, graduate stu
dent in Sociology, is the campus
representative of the Research
Center. Miss Goebel urges each
senior chosen to fill out and re
turn his questionnaire promptly.
