# 'Not Censorship' Says Chappie; Playboy Issue Cuts Voluntary
## 
### 
Brad Efron, heading the coming
I issue of the Chappie—a Playboy
j parody—ran into a few snags and
j suggestions that result in the ap
j pearance of some holes in the is
sue to hit the stands Wednesday, j
In Efron’s own words, “It has
j proven rather difficult to parody
! Playboy without delving into the
subject they consider paramount
—sex.”
Efron made it clear that while
he has spoken to Dean of Men
William Craig, and was given
some information in reference to
situations in past times as well as
to current problems, there was no
censorship enacted.
Anything removed was re
moved voluntarily by the Chappie
staff: Stated Efron, “We defi
nitely don’t want to give the im
pression that the deans are hound
ing us, because they aren’t. The
Chapie has had no censorship
trouble in the past few years, and
we don’t foresee any.”
COMMENTING further on the
Playboy issue whose “last minute
changes” resulted in “a few small
holes,” the Chappie editor stated,
“Wo tried to exaggerate the usual
preoccupations of the Playboy

people until they become obses
sions.
“The Dean’s office objected to
nothing specific; the material that
was cut involved both stories and
| pictures. Those lines which were
removed did not amount to any- j
thing major.”
Despite his consciousness of its
occasional patches of white space,
Efron -with a gleam in his eye
termed Wednesday’s issue “The
best in years.”
