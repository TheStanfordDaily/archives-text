# 'Go Fly a Kite' Says Prof, and...
## 
### 
If you see odd shapes aloft over
the Knoll Sunday afternoon, don't
panic. They aren’t flying saucers,
low-flying Vostoks, or Cuban mis
siles.
They are, in the words of Art
Prof. Matt Kahn, kites that “look
wonderful and fly marvelously.”
About 15 to 25 entries are ex
pected in a kite contest which is
to take place at 4 p.m. Sunday on
the hill behind the Knoll.
The kites, a project-for-credit in
the advanced design and sculp
ture classes of the Art and Archi
tecture Department, were as
signed with the injunction, “Be
inventive, go ‘far out.’ ”
The students were, and the
kites do.
