# US to Increase Viet Nam Aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Chair
man J. William Fulbright of the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee said last night he believed
Pi«sident Kennedy would send j
U.S. troops to save South Viet!
Nam from Communist conquest j
if all other steps failed.
The Arkansas Democrat made

the statement after a White
House conference with Kennedy.
He said the President made no
commitments concerning direct
U.S. military intervention.
Fulbright emerged from the
meeting shortly after Secretary of
State Dean Rusk said the United
States had undertaken an urgent
campaign to bolster South Viet
Nam against growing Communist
sabotage and terrorism.
BUSK TOLD a news conference
earlier that the President already
had authorized an increase in U.S.
military assistance to the South
Viet Nam government of Presi
dent Ngo Diem and was taking
other steps to counter the Com
munist threat.
The secretary added, however,
that he could neither confirm nor
deny reports from other authori
tative sources that Kennedy had
given Diem a pledge of U.S. mili
tary intervention if such action
proved necessary to save the coun
try.
FULBRIGHT stated he believed
India and Japan, as the two ma
jor eastern nations should be
brought into a program of cooper
ation which would represent “a
very formidable force.”
“If they won’t do it, then it’s
just too bad,” he said, “I don’t see
how, forever, if these countries
are not willing to make a real
contribution on defense, we can
bo expected to do it.”
Fulbright said he and Kennedy
did not discuss the Laotian crisis.
Asked whether he is writing off
Laos, Fulbright said he would not
like to “say that too bluntly.”
“They're still negotiating for a
cease-fire, and they may be able
1 to get a government that is neu
,tral,” he said.
