A tree
is for me...
and
everyone else
We come across many a young fellow
like this in our job of exploring and
drilling for oil.
As a visitor in the forest. Standard
has a responsibility to protect wild
life and keep the wilderness fresh and
green. And we accomplish this in
several ways by working closely with
fish and game and wildlife officials.
We steer around the feeding grounds,
using soft-tired vehicles to preserve
the natural ground cover. When wells
are in. we assure new growth by re
seeding grassland and planting young
trees on the work area.
Water wells, essential to our drilling
operations, also nourish thirsty plants
and animals...and nesting and breed
ing ponds are built for wild fowl.
Exploring teams in helicopters keep
sharp watch for fires, and on the
ground our men with bulldozers and
water trucks stand ready to help
when tire strikes.
Wherever Standard taps new oil
reserves to serve the nation â€”the
forest and the animals who live there
are protected.
planning ahead to serve you better
