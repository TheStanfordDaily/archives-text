# 'Knight' Praised—'Lively, Well Done' Ondine Adaptation
## 
### 
Whether the "arms" were those of a nereid or a princess, it was
obvious that "knight" was in capable hands when Ram's Head
opened its original Spring Show Festival in Memorial Auditorium.
From the hilarious "No, Not Salammbo" number to the stunning
"court of the king of the sea" and the stirring final meeting of the

errant knight and his sea nymph,
"Knight in Arms” is lively and
well done.
In adapting the legend of On
dine, Douglas Johnson and Hoddy
Guittard have utilized the several
opportunities for large chorus
numbers and enlarged the sotting
to include some very amusing
characters while, at the same
time, keeping the main plot line
clear and unencumbered.
DIRECTOR Tom Bissinger has
done a good job of keeping the
show well-paced and the stage
filled with interesting movement
which falters only occasionally.
In the role of the nereid who
becomes mortal only to be called
back to the sea, Betty Elchler is
lovely. She is a charming Ondine,
light and frivolous in her non
mortal state, more serious and
sensitive when she becomes hu
man.
Although Miss Eichler is the
real star of the show, Hans the
knight is well played by Dick Jac
qua. As the Duke of Upper Her
zenstein who is attracted to the
nymph because of her disarming
frankness, Jacqua’s portrayal
blends tenderness and just
enough pomposity which lends
humor to his solo “I Love War.”
WHILE BOTH Miss Eichler and
Jacqua have good voices, the 36-
piece orchestra drowns out too
many of the words to their songs.
Unfortunately, this occurs
throughout the show, making
many of the numbers completely
unintelligible from a verbal point
of view.
Along with having written the
book and lyrics for "Knight.”
Johnson is a contender for the
most applause in the show as the
extremely funny Lord Chamber
lain. His gift for comedy has
sparked many Ram's Hoad pro
ductions, and this one is no excep
tion.
Leading the “Salammbo” num
ber, Johnson also is a hit singing
“Today True Love Is Dead.” The
two pages provide amusing
touches to this number, but fre
quently their actions are distract
ing. causing the audience to lose
some of the words.
JOHN HARROP does an out
standing job as another comic
character, Herzenstein’s King Gre
garius Secundus. He, too, has a
keen sense of timing for the comic,
but never lets the role become
pure slapstick.
Ronald Feinberg has the rich
voice needed for Khuleborn, guar
dian of the nereids, but his charac
terization is too stiff and dispas
sionate, especially in his first
scenes.
Other characters of note in the
show were the princess Lorraine
for whom Hans deserts Ondine,
played by Judy Waterman; Eric
and Geltvin. the Lord Chamber
lain’s humorous sidekicks, charac
terized by Tim Laddish and Wil
liam Siden, who, with Dennis Gib
son and Peggy Norcross, join
Johnson for the show-stopping
“Salammbo.”
WHILE ALL the scene settings
are attractive and interesting, de
signed by May Delafield, the un
dersea scene which opens the sec
ond act is stunning. Mike Cham
breau’s lighting, good throughout
the show, contributes greatly to
the effectiveness of this sot.
The dancing in this scene is like
wise good, with interesting chore
ogrphy by Mary Alyce. By keep
ing the number of dancers down
to nine, Miss Alyce has eliminated
the messy chorus “spectaculars”
which marked Ram’s Head shows
several years ago.

The singing chorus sounds
good, too, especially in the snap
py. fun opening number, although
here, too, tuneful sounds fre
quently take the place of intelligi
ble words. The first act finale
suffers greatly from this, and
Miss Waterman's one solo is
scarcely audible.
“Knight in Arms’’ will continue
Friday and Saturday night in Me
morial Auditorium. 8:30 p.m.
Tickets are priced at $l, $1.50 and
$2 and are well worth the price.

keen sense of timing for the comic,
but never lets the role become
pure slapstick.
Ronald Feinberg has the rich
voice needed for Khuleborn, guar
dian of the nereids, but his charac
terization is too stiff and dispas
sionate, especially in his first
scenes.
Other characters of note in the
show were the princess Lorraine
for whom Hans deserts Ondine,
played by Judy Waterman; Eric
and Geltvin. the Lord Chamber
lain’s humorous sidekicks, charac
terized by Tim Laddish and Wil
liam Siden, who, with Dennis Gib
son and Peggy Norcross, join
Johnson for the show-stopping
“Salammbo.”
WHILE ALL the scene settings
are attractive and interesting, de
signed by May Delafield, the un
dersea scene which opens the sec
ond act is stunning. Mike Cham
breau’s lighting, good throughout
the show, contributes greatly to
the effectiveness of this sot.
The dancing in this scene is like
wise good, with interesting chore
ogrphy by Mary Alyce. By keep
ing the number of dancers down
to nine, Miss Alyce has eliminated
the messy chorus “spectaculars”
which marked Ram’s Head shows
several years ago.

The singing chorus sounds
good, too, especially in the snap
py. fun opening number, although
here, too, tuneful sounds fre
quently take the place of intelligi
ble words. The first act finale
suffers greatly from this, and
Miss Waterman's one solo is
scarcely audible.
“Knight in Arms’’ will continue
Friday and Saturday night in Me
morial Auditorium. 8:30 p.m.
Tickets are priced at $l, $1.50 and
$2 and are well worth the price.
Whether the "arms" were those of a nereid or a princess, it was
obvious that "knight" was in capable hands when Ram's Head
opened its original Spring Show Festival in Memorial Auditorium.
From the hilarious "No, Not Salammbo" number to the stunning
"court of the king of the sea" and the stirring final meeting of the

errant knight and his sea nymph,
"Knight in Arms” is lively and
well done.
In adapting the legend of On
dine, Douglas Johnson and Hoddy
Guittard have utilized the several
opportunities for large chorus
numbers and enlarged the sotting
to include some very amusing
characters while, at the same
time, keeping the main plot line
clear and unencumbered.
DIRECTOR Tom Bissinger has
done a good job of keeping the
show well-paced and the stage
filled with interesting movement
which falters only occasionally.
In the role of the nereid who
becomes mortal only to be called
back to the sea, Betty Elchler is
lovely. She is a charming Ondine,
light and frivolous in her non
mortal state, more serious and
sensitive when she becomes hu
man.
Although Miss Eichler is the
real star of the show, Hans the
knight is well played by Dick Jac
qua. As the Duke of Upper Her
zenstein who is attracted to the
nymph because of her disarming
frankness, Jacqua’s portrayal
blends tenderness and just
enough pomposity which lends
humor to his solo “I Love War.”
WHILE BOTH Miss Eichler and
Jacqua have good voices, the 36-
piece orchestra drowns out too
many of the words to their songs.
Unfortunately, this occurs
throughout the show, making
many of the numbers completely
unintelligible from a verbal point
of view.
Along with having written the
book and lyrics for "Knight.”
Johnson is a contender for the
most applause in the show as the
extremely funny Lord Chamber
lain. His gift for comedy has
sparked many Ram's Hoad pro
ductions, and this one is no excep
tion.
Leading the “Salammbo” num
ber, Johnson also is a hit singing
“Today True Love Is Dead.” The
two pages provide amusing
touches to this number, but fre
quently their actions are distract
ing. causing the audience to lose
some of the words.
JOHN HARROP does an out

done a good job of keeping the
show well-paced and the stage
filled with interesting movement
which falters only occasionally.
In the role of the nereid who
becomes mortal only to be called
back to the sea, Betty Elchler is
lovely. She is a charming Ondine,
light and frivolous in her non
mortal state, more serious and
sensitive when she becomes hu
man.
Although Miss Eichler is the
real star of the show, Hans the
knight is well played by Dick Jac
qua. As the Duke of Upper Her
zenstein who is attracted to the
nymph because of her disarming
frankness, Jacqua’s portrayal
blends tenderness and just
enough pomposity which lends
humor to his solo “I Love War.”
WHILE BOTH Miss Eichler and
Jacqua have good voices, the 36-
piece orchestra drowns out too
many of the words to their songs.
Unfortunately, this occurs
throughout the show, making
many of the numbers completely
unintelligible from a verbal point
of view.
Along with having written the
book and lyrics for "Knight.”
Johnson is a contender for the
most applause in the show as the
extremely funny Lord Chamber
lain. His gift for comedy has
sparked many Ram's Hoad pro
ductions, and this one is no excep
tion.
Leading the “Salammbo” num
ber, Johnson also is a hit singing
“Today True Love Is Dead.” The
two pages provide amusing
touches to this number, but fre
quently their actions are distract
ing. causing the audience to lose
some of the words.
JOHN HARROP does an out
standing job as another comic
character, Herzenstein’s King Gre
garius Secundus. He, too, has a
keen sense of timing for the comic,
but never lets the role become
pure slapstick.
Ronald Feinberg has the rich
voice needed for Khuleborn, guar
dian of the nereids, but his charac
terization is too stiff and dispas
sionate, especially in his first
scenes.
Other characters of note in the
show were the princess Lorraine
for whom Hans deserts Ondine,
played by Judy Waterman; Eric
and Geltvin. the Lord Chamber
lain’s humorous sidekicks, charac
terized by Tim Laddish and Wil
liam Siden, who, with Dennis Gib
son and Peggy Norcross, join
Johnson for the show-stopping
“Salammbo.”
WHILE ALL the scene settings
are attractive and interesting, de
signed by May Delafield, the un
dersea scene which opens the sec
ond act is stunning. Mike Cham
breau’s lighting, good throughout
the show, contributes greatly to
the effectiveness of this sot.
The dancing in this scene is like
wise good, with interesting chore
ogrphy by Mary Alyce. By keep
ing the number of dancers down
to nine, Miss Alyce has eliminated
the messy chorus “spectaculars”
which marked Ram’s Head shows
several years ago.

The singing chorus sounds
good, too, especially in the snap
py. fun opening number, although
here, too, tuneful sounds fre
quently take the place of intelligi
ble words. The first act finale
suffers greatly from this, and
Miss Waterman's one solo is
scarcely audible.
“Knight in Arms’’ will continue
Friday and Saturday night in Me
morial Auditorium. 8:30 p.m.
Tickets are priced at $l, $1.50 and
$2 and are well worth the price.
