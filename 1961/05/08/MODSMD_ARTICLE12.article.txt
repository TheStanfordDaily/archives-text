# Social Behavior Standards Needed

### 
The recent tear gas bombing of the Sigma Nu library and the
news that another fraternity has already experienced its pledge sneak
remind us that spring fever is again this year accompanied by imma
ture action on the part of some students.
To accuse only fraternity members of foolish springtime be
havior would, of course, be untrue. The Stern Hall chemical bomb
of last fall which temporarily blinded one student and last year's
light bulb throwing spree at Wilbur Hall are non-fraternity examples.
Both occurred in University residences where discipline codes are
ususally set up and enforced by the University through its residents
and directors. Such a disciplinary system leaves no room for stu
dent codification and control except by third person responsibility
and group pressure.
This is not the case with the fraternities. The fraternities possess
the responsibility of determining and enforcing their own discipli
nary system. The University charges the fraternities with this respon
sibility in its 1957 housing policy statement which states, "Each fra
ternity is to maintain an internal organization sufficiently strong in
leadership to plan, administer, and control the academic, social and
financial programs of the group."
While fraternities have lined up to this charge in some areas,
notably in the improving of their financial and academic programs,
they have unfortunately lagged in setting and maintaining standards
of social conduct.
The seven who threw the tear gas bomb returned to their house
to pick up the bomb. Surely a cooler, more mature mind could have
stopped the party at this point with some individual action. As it
happened, smarting eyes, not bomb fragment wounds, resulted from
the prank, but individual action would have prevented either from
occurring. True, group pressure in small living groups is sometimes
extremely difficult to resist, yet someone must resist it when events
are carried outside either law or decency.
Pledge sneaks, on the other hand, are both more destructive and
more difficult to slop. The cost to fraternities in personal injuries and
material damages has run into thousands of dollars in the last few
years while the ill will toward fraternities accrued from such action
is impossible to estimate in dollar value. The pledges, since they are
not living in the house, are harder to control. The lone fraternity can
instruct its pledge class not to sneak, but if they sneak anyway the
house is in no position to stop them. An all-fratemity ban on pledge
sneaks is needed. The group unity, which is the only worthy value
gained from this tribal custom, can be kept intact by a work project,
engineered and completed by the pledge class.
The Interfratemity Council, while proving itself adept at staging
Greek Weeks, has shown itseli reluctant to make any fraternity-wide
policy decisions. It has usually fallen into step behind the University
on fraternity policy instead of making it. Here is a chance for the
Council to create policy by outlawing a custom which has consist
ently resulted in more ill will than could be offset by a thousand
Greek Weeks.
