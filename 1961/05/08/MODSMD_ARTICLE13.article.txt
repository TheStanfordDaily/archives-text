# ON OTHER CAMPI
## Sides of Cuban Issue Colleges Back Both 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Some Stanford students and
faculty reacted with disappoint
ment mixed with bewilderment to
the news of the U.S. role in the
Cuban invasion. We couldn’t un
derstand why Kennedy, Eisen
hower, the American press, and
the American public felt as they
did. I wondered how other stu
dents at other universities felt.

As might be
expected, the
“Fair Play for
Cuba Commit
tee” planned ral
lies, debates, and
dis c us s i on s.
Some students
from each of the
colleges near the
rallies attended.
At two col-

ST ASSESS leges, San Fran
cisco State and the University of
Minnesota, considerable numbers
of anti ■ anti - invasion students
heckled the rallies. At S.F. State
the hecklers hurled invectives
such as “Beats don’t represent col
lege students, we do.” At Minne
sota the hecklers hurled snow
balls.

PERHAPS the editorials in stti
dent newspapers provide a better
over-all impression of student
opinion than do the actions of the
demonstrating few. The opinions
of editors vary from charges of
illegal action on the part of the
United States to carefully phrased
regret that the invasion failed.

The Phoenix, newspaper of
Swarthmore, carried an editorial
which said, "Recent aid to the Cu
ban counterrevolutionaries by U.S.
Neutrality Act and the Charter of
the Organization of American
States.” The Phoenix goes on to
advocate reconciliation with Cuba.
An editorial in the University
of Michigan Daily agrees with the
Phoenix. “If the United States is
to regain the honor that it so
highly prizes, it should obey inter
national and national law.” This
editorial goes on to suggest that

this country close her border to
Cuban revolutionists.
A later editorial in the Michigan
Daily agrees with this position,
stating “It would be a sad state
of affairs for this country to
adopt a defensive orientation of
policy toward Cuba.”
THE CORNELL DAILY SUN
states that “the United States is
Justified in allowing Cuban exiles
within its borders, but it must dis
associate itself with their ac
tions.” This was written on April
16, before the American public
knew the extent of U.S. aid to the
rebels.
The editorials on Cuba which
are hesitant or unwilling to con
demn the invasion, find some
thing else to complain about. The
UCLA Daily Bruin says that
"Cuba is but the most recent ex
ample of our deteriorated Latin
American policy.”
The Daily Bruin also demands
that Kennedy “make some reason
able statement on the invasion-aid
charges.” The Spartan Daily of
San Jose State also complains
about the “curtain of secrecy
which suddenly enveloped the
White House when the invasion
first began.”
THE UNIVERSITY Daily Kan
can can find little to condemn in
the invasion except that “it was
a miscalculation that failed.” The
same editorial later states that
"We have an interest in Cuba and
we will do all possible to protect
that interest.”
The San Francisco State news
paper takes a different view of
our interest. The editor of that
paper writes “Many Cubans—and
they may be right—think that our
actions were based primarily on
our business interests. This is not
the way to run a government.”
To me it seems that this inter
ests question is the crucial one.
We must decide if we should cen
ter our interest on United Fruit
Co., United States security, inter
national law, or the freedom of
everyone everywhere.
