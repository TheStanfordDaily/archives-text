More on Cuba
Open and vigorous political dis
cussion deserves wider participa
tion at Stanford. Campus debate
over the Cuban crisis is a case in
point. It has lx>en singularly one
sided. Critics of American policy
have coalesced into a single
group, with eloquent and aggres
sive leadership, employing plat
form, press, radio, and television
to assert its views. The opposi
tion hae neither organized nor
spoken out individually. Its iner
tia frustrates the democratic proc
ess of reaching sound judgments
on public issues, and it belies the
intellectual vigor of the Univer
sity community. One purpose of
this letter is to stimulate an active
competition of views about Cuba.
I concede ot the popular front,
which has been so vocal in behalf
of Fair Play for Cuba, that Ameri
can policy has taken many a
wrong turn—before, during, and
after Batista. Opportunities have
been missed by successive presi
dents, by the Department of State,
notoriously by CIA, to encourage
Cuba’s democratic development at
the expense of both totalitarian
ism-left and totalitarianism-right.
If American policy in Cuba is pre
cedent for American policy
throughout Latin America, the re
sults must be catastrophic for
both Latin America and ourselves.
There my concessions stop, I
dissent from Prof. Baran’s opin
ion, recently announced at Cub
beriey, that Castro demonstrated
“greatness” by switching in mid
stream from democratic to “so
cialist” revolution. I suspect that
Castro, as a Johnny-come-lately to
the Communist camp, will have
tenuous membership in the soci
ety of socialist dictators, which
distrusts men of flexible opinion
and prefers leaders who adhere
to an unswerving prototype. Of
course, Castro’s personal fate is
less momentous than that "so
cialist” revolution signifies im
placeable hostility toward demo
cratic capitalism (or democratic
socialism, for that matter) as
inherently irrational, inhumane,
and degenerate. In my scale of
values, it is not a stroke of
“greatness” to establish in Cuba
a strategic center for active dif
fusion throughout Latin America
of such implacable hostility to
the United States. One tragic as
pect of United States policy
toward Cuba is that it has given
Castro occasion for stigmatizing
this country as the foe of social
and economic reform in Latin
America. But one tragic aspect
of socialist dogma is its denial
that United States policy can he
reoriented and its triumphant de
duction that implacable hostility
for democracy is a necessary first
step toward Latin America’s eco
nomic development.

I do not share Prof. Sweezy’s
opinion, recently stated in cam
pus debate .that Marshall Plan
aid and, by inference, its sequels
are predatory measures for shor
ing-up capitalist ruling classes

both here and abroad. This view
is no more persuasive now than
in its first expression by the
USSR in 1947-1948. By definition,
according to this view, economic
aid flowing from capitalist de- ]
mocracy is imperialism barely
disguised. By definition, too, eco
nomic and military aid flowing
from the USSR or China is a “so
cialist dividend,” selfless charity i
from one proletariat to another. I
fending off the forces of imperial- j
ism and assisting each new social-1
ist society to fulfill its historical
mandate.
In a composite of Prof. Baran’s
eloquent phrases, socialist aid is
“the fruit of the heroism, endur
ance, and toil of the Russian work
ers and peasants.” Nourished by |
it, the courage of Cuban campesi- j
nos has turned “Castro’s torch |
into a blazing fire which con- j
sumed Batista, imperialism, and I
capitalism in Cuba.” Arriving at
a critical moment, it has injured
Cuba against defections or Cas
tro’s liberal associates in the July
26th movement, those “vacillating
fellow-travelers” of whom Prof.
Baran remarks, “Many leaves fall j
off before the heart of the arti-)
choke is reached.” That capitalist
aid is black and socialist aid white
offends my color-sense.
Fair Play for Cuba is a vegeta
rian alliance of two groups. There
are the artichoke leaves. Many of
us have marginal issues to discuss
with these “bourgeoisie.” And
then there are Professors Baran
and Sweezy. deep in the heart of
the artichoke, for whom interna
tional aid from the United States
in either wheat or munitions and
with or without a price tag is ne
cessarily destined for “United
States Gauleiters” abroad. In
their last analysis, the United
States can have no correct policy
toward Cuba. The substantial is
sues of social structure and na
tional interest, which Cuba is dra
matizing, align many of us spe
cifically against the views of these
gentlemen. Their “objective rea
son” assures them that Marxist
Socialism must sweep through La
tin America and that its momen j
turn can be accelerated by their j
active intellectual leadership of
popular fronts here. How objec
tive and how rational their views
are should be tested in free dis
cussion.
This letter is a personal expres

sinn, suggested by no one else and

Split infinitive
A number of I’ecent letters have
criticized you, Editor Parker, for
poor thinking, for even poorer
English, for errors in logic and
so on. But these critics are harsh:
they fail to see the real signifi
cance of your work. I, however,
if I might indulge here in a little
self-pride I had the ability to
recognize your intentions from
the very start. You are, Editor
Parker, I submit, one of the great
humorists in the field of Jour
nalism. Your critics simply fail
to see your great humor; that is
why they object to your editori
als. If they had only realized that
you are attempting every time
you write a word, phrase, or sen
tence, to be humorous, then they
would have been able to under
stand, as I do, that you are dis
gusted with traditional standards
of what everybody else calls good
journalism. If such standards call
for consistency in thought (even
within the same sentence) or for
some semblance of grammatical
English, you, Editor Parker, have
decided to do away with such
trivia, to penetrate instead with
your incomparable wit to the
very heart of matters.
Thus, Editor Parker, you sly
humorist you, when you split in
finitives with parenthetical ex
pressions; when you bring in his
torical analogies (usually from
the middle ages, it seems) that
serve only to obfuscate your top
ic; when finally you can write
such barbaric syntax as “If he
happened to still be alive, Thurs
day woidd he Lcland Stanford's
137 th birthday” I enjoy your
work, I chuckle, it makes my
morning breakfast more pleasant.
But one point in the quotation I
just gave still puzzles me. Tell
us, Editor Parker: did Thursday
perhaps die of a split infinitive?

Cuba against defections or Cas

26th movement, those “vacillating

Split infinitive
A number of I’ecent letters have
criticized you, Editor Parker, for
poor thinking, for even poorer
English, for errors in logic and
so on. But these critics are harsh:
they fail to see the real signifi
cance of your work. I, however,
if I might indulge here in a little
self-pride I had the ability to
recognize your intentions from
the very start. You are, Editor
Parker, I submit, one of the great
humorists in the field of Jour
nalism. Your critics simply fail
to see your great humor; that is
why they object to your editori
als. If they had only realized that
you are attempting every time
you write a word, phrase, or sen
tence, to be humorous, then they
would have been able to under
stand, as I do, that you are dis
gusted with traditional standards
of what everybody else calls good
journalism. If such standards call
for consistency in thought (even
within the same sentence) or for
some semblance of grammatical
English, you, Editor Parker, have
decided to do away with such
trivia, to penetrate instead with
your incomparable wit to the
very heart of matters.
Thus, Editor Parker, you sly
humorist you, when you split in
finitives with parenthetical ex
pressions; when you bring in his
torical analogies (usually from
the middle ages, it seems) that
serve only to obfuscate your top
ic; when finally you can write
such barbaric syntax as “If he
happened to still be alive, Thurs
day woidd he Lcland Stanford's
137 th birthday” I enjoy your
work, I chuckle, it makes my
morning breakfast more pleasant.
But one point in the quotation I
just gave still puzzles me. Tell
us, Editor Parker: did Thursday
perhaps die of a split infinitive?

More on Cuba
Open and vigorous political dis
cussion deserves wider participa
tion at Stanford. Campus debate
over the Cuban crisis is a case in
point. It has lx>en singularly one
sided. Critics of American policy
have coalesced into a single
group, with eloquent and aggres
sive leadership, employing plat
form, press, radio, and television
to assert its views. The opposi
tion hae neither organized nor
spoken out individually. Its iner
tia frustrates the democratic proc
ess of reaching sound judgments
on public issues, and it belies the
intellectual vigor of the Univer
sity community. One purpose of
this letter is to stimulate an active
competition of views about Cuba.
I concede ot the popular front,
which has been so vocal in behalf
of Fair Play for Cuba, that Ameri
can policy has taken many a
wrong turn—before, during, and
after Batista. Opportunities have
been missed by successive presi
dents, by the Department of State,
notoriously by CIA, to encourage
Cuba’s democratic development at
the expense of both totalitarian
ism-left and totalitarianism-right.
If American policy in Cuba is pre
cedent for American policy
throughout Latin America, the re
sults must be catastrophic for
both Latin America and ourselves.
There my concessions stop, I
dissent from Prof. Baran’s opin
ion, recently announced at Cub
beriey, that Castro demonstrated
“greatness” by switching in mid
stream from democratic to “so
cialist” revolution. I suspect that
Castro, as a Johnny-come-lately to
the Communist camp, will have
tenuous membership in the soci
ety of socialist dictators, which
distrusts men of flexible opinion
and prefers leaders who adhere
to an unswerving prototype. Of
course, Castro’s personal fate is
less momentous than that "so
cialist” revolution signifies im
placeable hostility toward demo
cratic capitalism (or democratic
socialism, for that matter) as
inherently irrational, inhumane,
and degenerate. In my scale of
values, it is not a stroke of
“greatness” to establish in Cuba
a strategic center for active dif
fusion throughout Latin America
of such implacable hostility to
the United States. One tragic as
pect of United States policy
toward Cuba is that it has given
Castro occasion for stigmatizing
this country as the foe of social
and economic reform in Latin
America. But one tragic aspect
of socialist dogma is its denial
that United States policy can he
reoriented and its triumphant de
duction that implacable hostility
for democracy is a necessary first

Split infinitive
A number of I’ecent letters have
criticized you, Editor Parker, for
poor thinking, for even poorer
English, for errors in logic and
so on. But these critics are harsh:
they fail to see the real signifi
cance of your work. I, however,
if I might indulge here in a little
self-pride I had the ability to
recognize your intentions from
the very start. You are, Editor
Parker, I submit, one of the great
humorists in the field of Jour
nalism. Your critics simply fail
to see your great humor; that is
why they object to your editori
als. If they had only realized that
you are attempting every time
you write a word, phrase, or sen
tence, to be humorous, then they
would have been able to under
stand, as I do, that you are dis
gusted with traditional standards
of what everybody else calls good
journalism. If such standards call
for consistency in thought (even
within the same sentence) or for
some semblance of grammatical
English, you, Editor Parker, have
decided to do away with such
trivia, to penetrate instead with
your incomparable wit to the
very heart of matters.
Thus, Editor Parker, you sly
humorist you, when you split in
finitives with parenthetical ex
pressions; when you bring in his
torical analogies (usually from
the middle ages, it seems) that
serve only to obfuscate your top
ic; when finally you can write
such barbaric syntax as “If he
happened to still be alive, Thurs
day woidd he Lcland Stanford's
137 th birthday” I enjoy your
work, I chuckle, it makes my
morning breakfast more pleasant.
But one point in the quotation I
just gave still puzzles me. Tell
us, Editor Parker: did Thursday
perhaps die of a split infinitive?

More on Cuba
Open and vigorous political dis
cussion deserves wider participa
tion at Stanford. Campus debate
over the Cuban crisis is a case in
point. It has lx>en singularly one
sided. Critics of American policy
have coalesced into a single
group, with eloquent and aggres
sive leadership, employing plat
form, press, radio, and television
to assert its views. The opposi
tion hae neither organized nor
spoken out individually. Its iner
tia frustrates the democratic proc
ess of reaching sound judgments
on public issues, and it belies the
intellectual vigor of the Univer
sity community. One purpose of
this letter is to stimulate an active
competition of views about Cuba.
I concede ot the popular front,
which has been so vocal in behalf
of Fair Play for Cuba, that Ameri
can policy has taken many a
wrong turn—before, during, and
after Batista. Opportunities have
been missed by successive presi
dents, by the Department of State,
notoriously by CIA, to encourage
Cuba’s democratic development at
the expense of both totalitarian
ism-left and totalitarianism-right.
If American policy in Cuba is pre
cedent for American policy
throughout Latin America, the re
sults must be catastrophic for
both Latin America and ourselves.
There my concessions stop, I
dissent from Prof. Baran’s opin
ion, recently announced at Cub
beriey, that Castro demonstrated
“greatness” by switching in mid
stream from democratic to “so
cialist” revolution. I suspect that
Castro, as a Johnny-come-lately to
the Communist camp, will have
tenuous membership in the soci
ety of socialist dictators, which
distrusts men of flexible opinion
and prefers leaders who adhere
to an unswerving prototype. Of
course, Castro’s personal fate is
less momentous than that "so
cialist” revolution signifies im
placeable hostility toward demo
cratic capitalism (or democratic
socialism, for that matter) as
inherently irrational, inhumane,
and degenerate. In my scale of
values, it is not a stroke of
“greatness” to establish in Cuba
a strategic center for active dif
fusion throughout Latin America
of such implacable hostility to
the United States. One tragic as
pect of United States policy
toward Cuba is that it has given
Castro occasion for stigmatizing
this country as the foe of social
and economic reform in Latin
America. But one tragic aspect
of socialist dogma is its denial
that United States policy can he
reoriented and its triumphant de
duction that implacable hostility
for democracy is a necessary first
step toward Latin America’s eco
nomic development.

I do not share Prof. Sweezy’s
opinion, recently stated in cam
pus debate .that Marshall Plan
aid and, by inference, its sequels
are predatory measures for shor
ing-up capitalist ruling classes

both here and abroad. This view
is no more persuasive now than
in its first expression by the
USSR in 1947-1948. By definition,
according to this view, economic
aid flowing from capitalist de- ]
mocracy is imperialism barely
disguised. By definition, too, eco
nomic and military aid flowing
from the USSR or China is a “so
cialist dividend,” selfless charity i
from one proletariat to another. I
fending off the forces of imperial- j
ism and assisting each new social-1
ist society to fulfill its historical
mandate.
In a composite of Prof. Baran’s
eloquent phrases, socialist aid is
“the fruit of the heroism, endur
ance, and toil of the Russian work
ers and peasants.” Nourished by |
it, the courage of Cuban campesi- j
nos has turned “Castro’s torch |
into a blazing fire which con- j
sumed Batista, imperialism, and I
capitalism in Cuba.” Arriving at
a critical moment, it has injured
Cuba against defections or Cas
tro’s liberal associates in the July
26th movement, those “vacillating
fellow-travelers” of whom Prof.
Baran remarks, “Many leaves fall j
off before the heart of the arti-)
choke is reached.” That capitalist
aid is black and socialist aid white
offends my color-sense.
Fair Play for Cuba is a vegeta
rian alliance of two groups. There
are the artichoke leaves. Many of
us have marginal issues to discuss
with these “bourgeoisie.” And
then there are Professors Baran
and Sweezy. deep in the heart of
the artichoke, for whom interna
tional aid from the United States
in either wheat or munitions and
with or without a price tag is ne
cessarily destined for “United
States Gauleiters” abroad. In
their last analysis, the United
States can have no correct policy
toward Cuba. The substantial is
sues of social structure and na
tional interest, which Cuba is dra
matizing, align many of us spe
cifically against the views of these
gentlemen. Their “objective rea
son” assures them that Marxist
Socialism must sweep through La
tin America and that its momen j
turn can be accelerated by their j
active intellectual leadership of

sive leadership, employing plat
form, press, radio, and television
to assert its views. The opposi
tion hae neither organized nor
spoken out individually. Its iner
tia frustrates the democratic proc
ess of reaching sound judgments
on public issues, and it belies the
intellectual vigor of the Univer
sity community. One purpose of
this letter is to stimulate an active
competition of views about Cuba.
I concede ot the popular front,
which has been so vocal in behalf
of Fair Play for Cuba, that Ameri
can policy has taken many a
wrong turn—before, during, and
after Batista. Opportunities have
been missed by successive presi
dents, by the Department of State,
notoriously by CIA, to encourage
Cuba’s democratic development at
the expense of both totalitarian
ism-left and totalitarianism-right.
If American policy in Cuba is pre
cedent for American policy
throughout Latin America, the re
sults must be catastrophic for
both Latin America and ourselves.
There my concessions stop, I
dissent from Prof. Baran’s opin
ion, recently announced at Cub
beriey, that Castro demonstrated
“greatness” by switching in mid
stream from democratic to “so
cialist” revolution. I suspect that
Castro, as a Johnny-come-lately to
the Communist camp, will have
tenuous membership in the soci
ety of socialist dictators, which
distrusts men of flexible opinion
and prefers leaders who adhere
to an unswerving prototype. Of
course, Castro’s personal fate is
less momentous than that "so
cialist” revolution signifies im
placeable hostility toward demo
cratic capitalism (or democratic
socialism, for that matter) as
inherently irrational, inhumane,
and degenerate. In my scale of
values, it is not a stroke of
“greatness” to establish in Cuba
a strategic center for active dif
fusion throughout Latin America
of such implacable hostility to
the United States. One tragic as
pect of United States policy
toward Cuba is that it has given
Castro occasion for stigmatizing
this country as the foe of social
and economic reform in Latin
America. But one tragic aspect
of socialist dogma is its denial
that United States policy can he
reoriented and its triumphant de
duction that implacable hostility
for democracy is a necessary first
step toward Latin America’s eco
nomic development.

I do not share Prof. Sweezy’s
opinion, recently stated in cam
pus debate .that Marshall Plan
aid and, by inference, its sequels
are predatory measures for shor
ing-up capitalist ruling classes

both here and abroad. This view
is no more persuasive now than
in its first expression by the
USSR in 1947-1948. By definition,
according to this view, economic
aid flowing from capitalist de- ]
mocracy is imperialism barely
disguised. By definition, too, eco
nomic and military aid flowing
from the USSR or China is a “so
cialist dividend,” selfless charity i
from one proletariat to another. I
fending off the forces of imperial- j
ism and assisting each new social-1
ist society to fulfill its historical
mandate.
In a composite of Prof. Baran’s
eloquent phrases, socialist aid is
“the fruit of the heroism, endur
ance, and toil of the Russian work
ers and peasants.” Nourished by |
it, the courage of Cuban campesi- j
nos has turned “Castro’s torch |
into a blazing fire which con- j
sumed Batista, imperialism, and I
capitalism in Cuba.” Arriving at
a critical moment, it has injured
Cuba against defections or Cas
tro’s liberal associates in the July
26th movement, those “vacillating
fellow-travelers” of whom Prof.
Baran remarks, “Many leaves fall j
off before the heart of the arti-)
choke is reached.” That capitalist
aid is black and socialist aid white
offends my color-sense.
Fair Play for Cuba is a vegeta
rian alliance of two groups. There
are the artichoke leaves. Many of
us have marginal issues to discuss
with these “bourgeoisie.” And
then there are Professors Baran
and Sweezy. deep in the heart of
the artichoke, for whom interna
tional aid from the United States
in either wheat or munitions and
with or without a price tag is ne
cessarily destined for “United
States Gauleiters” abroad. In
their last analysis, the United
States can have no correct policy
toward Cuba. The substantial is
sues of social structure and na
tional interest, which Cuba is dra
matizing, align many of us spe
cifically against the views of these
gentlemen. Their “objective rea
son” assures them that Marxist
Socialism must sweep through La
tin America and that its momen j
turn can be accelerated by their j
active intellectual leadership of
popular fronts here. How objec
tive and how rational their views
are should be tested in free dis
cussion.
This letter is a personal expres

Split infinitive
A number of I’ecent letters have
criticized you, Editor Parker, for
poor thinking, for even poorer
English, for errors in logic and
so on. But these critics are harsh:
they fail to see the real signifi
cance of your work. I, however,
if I might indulge here in a little
self-pride I had the ability to
recognize your intentions from
the very start. You are, Editor
Parker, I submit, one of the great
humorists in the field of Jour
nalism. Your critics simply fail
to see your great humor; that is
why they object to your editori
als. If they had only realized that
you are attempting every time
you write a word, phrase, or sen
tence, to be humorous, then they
would have been able to under
stand, as I do, that you are dis
gusted with traditional standards
of what everybody else calls good
journalism. If such standards call
for consistency in thought (even
within the same sentence) or for
some semblance of grammatical
English, you, Editor Parker, have
decided to do away with such
trivia, to penetrate instead with
your incomparable wit to the
very heart of matters.
Thus, Editor Parker, you sly
humorist you, when you split in
finitives with parenthetical ex
pressions; when you bring in his
torical analogies (usually from
the middle ages, it seems) that
serve only to obfuscate your top
ic; when finally you can write
such barbaric syntax as “If he
happened to still be alive, Thurs
day woidd he Lcland Stanford's
137 th birthday” I enjoy your
work, I chuckle, it makes my
morning breakfast more pleasant.
But one point in the quotation I
just gave still puzzles me. Tell
us, Editor Parker: did Thursday
perhaps die of a split infinitive?
