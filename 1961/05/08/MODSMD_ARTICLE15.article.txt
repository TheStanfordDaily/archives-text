## 
### GLENN ALFRED 
Califoi'nia won the 66th renew
al of the Big Meet, 69-62, in a
elose battle that went right down
to the final relay Saturday. The
win tied the series at 32 each,
with two meets ending in ties.
The top performances for Stan
ford came from Craig Barrett,
John Nourse. and John North
way.
Barrett accumulated 10 vital
points in four events, lie won the
low hurdles in a time of 24.3, fin
ished second in the broad jump
with a best jump of 23-9U, and
ended up in the show column in
the high hurdles and 100 yard
dash.
Northway topped his previous
best time in the two mile by 2.3.9
seconds, finishing second to Cal's
Al Gaylord in 9:16.
XOIIRSK WON the high
hurdles and finished third in the
lows all this after he wasn’t
deemed good enough to make the
trip to Washington last week.
Other winning Stanford per
formers were: Phil White in the
pole vault, 14-0; Art Batehelder,
javelin. 213-9; Charles Barth, in
the broad jump, 24- : b : and Dave
Weill and Don Bell, one-two in
the discus with distances of 172-
3'l- and 168- :! 4 ,
Several factors ruined Stan
ford’s chances to win the meet.
California swept the high jump
where Stanford had figured for
at least a second. Star Stanford
broad jumper Dan Moore badly
pulled a muscle, which kept him
out of the first three places. And

7X>aiUi Sj&<nt4

finally, the Indians failed to ac
complish a possible sweep of the
low hurdles, as Cal's Bill Barbee
sneaked past Nourse and Bill
Wandry for those important sec
ond place points.
The Bears’ Cebron Russ, one of
the all-time great Big Meet per
formers having scored two firsts
and a second last year, reinjured
his knee and was unable to ac
complish more than a third place
in the broad jump. This hurt Cal.
but didn’t keep them away from
victory.
TIIK MKKT started slowly for
Stanford, even though Bob Atkin
son got an unexpected second in
the shot put with a heave of 31-
? ;i 4. Cal's Dave Maggard won the
event as expected with a put of
37-1 :, 4 . Woody Covington and
Gaylord finished 1-2 in the mile
for the Bears, with the Indians’
Rich Klier third. Northway was
held out of the four-lapper in
preparation for the grueling two
mile to come. Klier was entered
here instead of in his specialty,
the 880, a coaching move that
backfired.
Cal’s Bob Karlsrud won both
the 220 and the 440 as expected,
and Ron Suggs swept past Bar
rett and Len Bresehini to win the
100 yard dash in a slow 10 flat.
Rich Parker kept Stanford go
ing with a second in the 880, as
he drove past two rival runners
to finish behind Cal's Marty Zie
barth.
CALIFORNIA led 38-37 at the
time, and with a probable sweep
of the two-mile the Bears seemed
a cinch to win even without the
relay.
Northway wasn’t given much
of a chance to finish better than
fourth, since Cal's four entries
had times 10 seconds under his
best of 9:41.9.
Before the two-mile, Stanford
Coach Payton Jordan and his
team surrounded the inner ring
of the track to cheer on North
way and warn him when any of

the Cal men tried to move past
him.
As the race started, Stanford’s
Robin Nowinski look the lead and
set the pace for the first lap.
Then Gaylord, Nbrthway, and
George Linn, a former teammate
of Northway’s at Palo Alto High
School, took over. All Linn had
to do was to finish ahead of
Northway, and for all intents and
purposes, the meet would he over.
HR COII.IIN'T do it. Northwa\
took over second place l ight be
hind Gaylord lor the last se\en
laps and never relinquished it.
Linn made his move on the first
turn of the sixlh lap. Immediately
the Stanford athletes surrounding
the track began yelling and wa\
ing Northway to run even faster,
Northway turned on the speed
and when Linn tried to cut in
he almost bumped the Card star,
Linn waited as Gaylord took
the lead by 13 yards. I’inallj on
the backs!retch of the last lap
Linn moved again, but Northway
was kicking, and at the tape he
had almost caught Gaylord. lie
finished second, three yards be
hind the winner, and was mobbed
by his Stanford teammates.
All the drama of the two-mile
event went for naught, as Cal
won the relay. The Bears had a
two-yard lead as Rich Parker
passed to Klier for the last lap.
The perfect pass sprung Klier into
a short lead but Karlsrud, the
rival anchor man, went into high
gear in the last 1(10 yards and
won going away for Cal. His re
lay lap was 47.1 while Klier, prf
marily an 880 man, finished in
47.8.

Robin Nowinski look the lead and
set the pace for the first lap.
Then Gaylord, Nbrthway, and
George Linn, a former teammate

to do was to finish ahead of
Northway, and for all intents and
purposes, the meet would he over.
HR COII.IIN'T do it. Northwa\
took over second place l ight be

laps and never relinquished it.
Linn made his move on the first
turn of the sixlh lap. Immediately
the Stanford athletes surrounding
the track began yelling and wa\
ing Northway to run even faster,
Northway turned on the speed
and when Linn tried to cut in
he almost bumped the Card star,
Linn waited as Gaylord took
the lead by 13 yards. I’inallj on
the backs!retch of the last lap
Linn moved again, but Northway
was kicking, and at the tape he
had almost caught Gaylord. lie
finished second, three yards be
hind the winner, and was mobbed
by his Stanford teammates.
All the drama of the two-mile
event went for naught, as Cal
won the relay. The Bears had a
two-yard lead as Rich Parker
passed to Klier for the last lap.
The perfect pass sprung Klier into
a short lead but Karlsrud, the
rival anchor man, went into high
gear in the last 1(10 yards and
won going away for Cal. His re
lay lap was 47.1 while Klier, prf
marily an 880 man, finished in
47.8.
Califoi'nia won the 66th renew

The top performances for Stan
ford came from Craig Barrett,
John Nourse. and John North
way.

ished second in the broad jump
with a best jump of 23-9U, and

best time in the two mile by 2.3.9
seconds, finishing second to Cal's
Al Gaylord in 9:16.

the broad jump, 24- : b : and Dave
Weill and Don Bell, one-two in
the discus with distances of 172-

Several factors ruined Stan
ford’s chances to win the meet.
California swept the high jump
where Stanford had figured for
at least a second. Star Stanford
broad jumper Dan Moore badly
pulled a muscle, which kept him
out of the first three places. And

finally, the Indians failed to ac

low hurdles, as Cal's Bill Barbee
sneaked past Nourse and Bill
Wandry for those important sec

The Bears’ Cebron Russ, one of
the all-time great Big Meet per
formers having scored two firsts
and a second last year, reinjured
his knee and was unable to ac

in the broad jump. This hurt Cal.
but didn’t keep them away from
victory.
TIIK MKKT started slowly for
Stanford, even though Bob Atkin
son got an unexpected second in

event as expected with a put of
37-1 :, 4 . Woody Covington and
Gaylord finished 1-2 in the mile
for the Bears, with the Indians’
Rich Klier third. Northway was
held out of the four-lapper in
preparation for the grueling two
mile to come. Klier was entered
here instead of in his specialty,
the 880, a coaching move that
backfired.
Cal’s Bob Karlsrud won both
the 220 and the 440 as expected,
and Ron Suggs swept past Bar
rett and Len Bresehini to win the
100 yard dash in a slow 10 flat.
Rich Parker kept Stanford go

he drove past two rival runners
to finish behind Cal's Marty Zie

CALIFORNIA led 38-37 at the
time, and with a probable sweep
of the two-mile the Bears seemed
a cinch to win even without the
relay.
Northway wasn’t given much
of a chance to finish better than

The Bears’ Cebron Russ, one of
the all-time great Big Meet per
formers having scored two firsts
and a second last year, reinjured
his knee and was unable to ac
complish more than a third place
in the broad jump. This hurt Cal.
but didn’t keep them away from
victory.
TIIK MKKT started slowly for
Stanford, even though Bob Atkin
son got an unexpected second in
the shot put with a heave of 31-
? ;i 4. Cal's Dave Maggard won the
event as expected with a put of
37-1 :, 4 . Woody Covington and
Gaylord finished 1-2 in the mile
for the Bears, with the Indians’
Rich Klier third. Northway was
held out of the four-lapper in
preparation for the grueling two
mile to come. Klier was entered
here instead of in his specialty,
the 880, a coaching move that
backfired.
Cal’s Bob Karlsrud won both
the 220 and the 440 as expected,
and Ron Suggs swept past Bar
rett and Len Bresehini to win the
100 yard dash in a slow 10 flat.
Rich Parker kept Stanford go
ing with a second in the 880, as
he drove past two rival runners
to finish behind Cal's Marty Zie
barth.
CALIFORNIA led 38-37 at the
time, and with a probable sweep
of the two-mile the Bears seemed
a cinch to win even without the
relay.
Northway wasn’t given much
of a chance to finish better than
fourth, since Cal's four entries
had times 10 seconds under his
best of 9:41.9.
Before the two-mile, Stanford
Coach Payton Jordan and his
team surrounded the inner ring
of the track to cheer on North
way and warn him when any of

the Cal men tried to move past
him.
As the race started, Stanford’s
Robin Nowinski look the lead and
set the pace for the first lap.
Then Gaylord, Nbrthway, and
George Linn, a former teammate
of Northway’s at Palo Alto High
School, took over. All Linn had
to do was to finish ahead of
Northway, and for all intents and
purposes, the meet would he over.
HR COII.IIN'T do it. Northwa\
took over second place l ight be
hind Gaylord lor the last se\en
laps and never relinquished it.
Linn made his move on the first
turn of the sixlh lap. Immediately
the Stanford athletes surrounding
the track began yelling and wa\
ing Northway to run even faster,
Northway turned on the speed
and when Linn tried to cut in
he almost bumped the Card star,
Linn waited as Gaylord took
the lead by 13 yards. I’inallj on
the backs!retch of the last lap
Linn moved again, but Northway
was kicking, and at the tape he
had almost caught Gaylord. lie
finished second, three yards be
hind the winner, and was mobbed
by his Stanford teammates.
All the drama of the two-mile
event went for naught, as Cal
won the relay. The Bears had a
two-yard lead as Rich Parker
passed to Klier for the last lap.
The perfect pass sprung Klier into
a short lead but Karlsrud, the
rival anchor man, went into high
gear in the last 1(10 yards and
won going away for Cal. His re
lay lap was 47.1 while Klier, prf
marily an 880 man, finished in
47.8.
Califoi'nia won the 66th renew

to the final relay Saturday. The
win tied the series at 32 each,
with two meets ending in ties.
The top performances for Stan
ford came from Craig Barrett,
John Nourse. and John North

ished second in the broad jump
with a best jump of 23-9U, and
ended up in the show column in

the broad jump, 24- : b : and Dave
Weill and Don Bell, one-two in

Several factors ruined Stan

California swept the high jump
where Stanford had figured for
at least a second. Star Stanford
broad jumper Dan Moore badly
pulled a muscle, which kept him
out of the first three places. And
