# Crew Retains Harbach Cup
## 
### 
Stanford crew retained posses
sion of the Harbach Cup by virtue
of its three-length win o\'er USC
in Los Angeles Harbor Saturday,
UCLA was third, finishing about
tw'o seconds behind the Trojans.
The varsity victory coupled
with a first in JV competition and
a second in the freshman race
gave the Indians a total of 19
points and the light to keep the
cup another year.
UCLA took second place with 16
points after winning the frosh
event and taking second to the
Stanford JVs. USC was a distant
third with 11 points. The low
score can be attributed to the fact
that the Trojans did not enter in
the freshman division.
