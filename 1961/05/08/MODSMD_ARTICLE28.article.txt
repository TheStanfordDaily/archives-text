### 
Where are the Republicans?
Thatâ€™s what Prof. John Bunzel,
head of the Northern California
Citizenship Clearinghouse, would
like to know.
The group is offering an op
portunity for Republicans and
Democrat s to work for two
months this summer in the party
headquarters in San Francisco, at
$2OO per month, but thus far many
Democrats but no Republicans
have applied.
Bunzel asks that any interested
Republican, particularly gradu
ates or seniors, see him immedi
ately in room 22E, Political Sci
ence.
