## 
### 
The tear gas bomb thrown into
the Sigma Nu house last Wednes
day night turned out to be a fra
ternity prank perpetrated by sev
en Theta Chi brothers, according
to Dean of Men W'illiam G. Craig.

Stanford Police Chief Gordon
Davis announced that the names
of the offenders have been sent to
Craig for disciplinary action.
Earlier the FBf had been working
on the case since tear gas bomb
ings fall under their jurisdiction.
Davis said that the bombing
was meant to appear to be a
pledge sneak and that the seven
Theta Chi’s had intended to steal
silverware not a radio, which they
pilfered instead in the confusion.
The bomb crashed through a
window in Sigma Nu’s library at
1:00 a.m. Wednesday. The explo
sion did not injure any of the four
students studying in the room.
The bomb did damage the room,
however.
Davis said that the student of
fenders had had the tear gas born!)
in their possession for four years.
He credited the prompt solution
of the case to the excellent coop
eration from the fraternity men |
involved.
