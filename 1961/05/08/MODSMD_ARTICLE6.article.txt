## 
### 
Russia will put more men in !
space before the end of this year.
Lt. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever pre
dicted Saturday at the second an
nual alumni convention of the
Graduate School of Business. i

Schriever, air force missile
chief, said that the success of as- i
tronaut Alan Shepard, Jr.’s, flight)
on Friday will probably not speed j
up the U.S.’s Mercury man-in- j
space schedule, which calls for the j
first orbital flight late this year. (
SCHRIEVER declared emphati
cally that the U.S. cannot afford |
to be second place in space and j
that the national budget can stand i
the strain of an all-out space ef-1
fort.

While ho believes that present ;
air force satellite programs are
getting enough money. Schriever
said that with a determined pro
gram the U.S. could have a man
on the moon by 1970. and called |
for this determination to be first
from the American people because
"the future of free men every
where may depend on our accom
plishments in space.”
HE DENIED, however, that a
gap in space research and devel
opment work exists.
The Russians have more mis
siles but U.S. development work
on solid-fuel and nuclear rocketry
is probably more advanced. He |
pointed also to the successful 1
Minuteman missile firing early ‘
this year as an important, accom
plishment, describing the missile
as economically superior to other
U.S. missiles.
