HIGHER EDUCATIONâ€”EXTENSION COURSE AT THE KNOLL
Art Prof, Matt Kahn asked his students in advanced design and sculpture classes to design
far-out kites and fly them at the Knoll yesterday. So the students and a small group of
spectators showed up and the kites were flown though none was very avant-garde, as
kites go. Repairing a downed kite are sophomore Harvey Nelson. Mrs. Nelson and Linda
Paccagnella.
