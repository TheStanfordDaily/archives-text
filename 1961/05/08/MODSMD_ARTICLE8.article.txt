# Congo Government to Try Tshombe for High Treason
## Katanga Head Charged With Lumumba Murder 
### 
COQUILHATVILLE, Congo (UPl)—The government of Premier
Joseph Kasavubu announced yesterday it would try Katanga Presi
dent Moise Tshombe for the murder of Patrice Lumumba and for
other crimes of high treason.
Murder and high treason are punishable by death.

An announcement by Foreign
Minister Justin Bomboko said the
Kasavubu government also would
“do everything in our power to
liberate the province of Katanga
by force if necessary.” Tshombe
declared Katanga independent of
the central government last sum
mer

(ELISABETHVILLE dispatches
said Katanga was threatening to
destroy vital dams, communica
tions centers and other strategic
points if Leopoldville tried to im
pose its will. Interior Minister
Godfroid Munungo warned Satur
day that “useless massacres”
would follow interference in Ka
tanga affairs.)
The announcement came at a
press conference attended by
army strongman Maj. Gen. Jo
seph Mobutu whose troops seized
Tshombe when he stalked out of
a Congo “summit conference”
here aimed at turning the Congo
into a loose federation of states.
Lumumba, who became pre
mier when the Congo achieved its
independence last spring, was de
posed by Mobutu who decided he
was taking the Congo into the
Communist camp. Lumumba was
flown to Katanga Province for
safe keeping but was reported
killed trying to escape.
THE COMMUNIST world and
many African nations contended
he was murdered by the Katanga
government and that the escape
story was put out as a cover-up
attempt. His death was announced
on Feb. 12.
Tshombe has been under para
troop guard for nine days in a
rambling riverside villa half a
mile away from the hall where the
conference of Congolese leaders is
being hold.
The announcement he would be
put on trial was in sharp contrast
with a statement made two days
ago in Leopoldville by foreign of
fice spokesman Pascal Kapella.
Kapella said Tshombe would be
free to return to his capital of
Elisabethville when the confer
ence ended.

THE CENTRAL government’s
tough attitude toward Tshombe
was considered a victory for Bom
boko who always has been a fierce
opponent of any move that might
have been interpreted as a recog
nition of Katangancse independ
ence.

Bomboko was not present at the
Tanarivc conference on Madagas
car last March where Tshombo’s
predominant influence led other
Congolese leaders to agree on a
future confederation in which the
various states would be largely
self-ruling.

Bomboko was known (o have
been extremely critical of this de
cision. Moreover, widespread dis
agreement developed among the
Congolese leaders over how this
w r as to be carried out.
THE FOREIGN minister told
the press conference yesterday if
was not by popular reaction but
on government orders that army
soldiers prevented Tshombe from
leaving Coquilhatville after ho
stalked out of the conference.
Bomboko, who held the press
conference at the home of a rela
tive where ho is staying, accused
Tshombe of at least four major
crimes:
• The assassination of Baluba
tribesmen in northern Katanga
Province by his mercenaries from
abroad, and the assassination of
political prisoners including Lu
mumba. Punishable by death.

• Counterfeiting by printing
his own francs, a crime that could
be punished by hard labor.
• Rebelling against (he central
government, a crime of high trea
son punishable by death.
• The theft of arms, planes and
bank funds which the central
Congo government Inherited from
Belgium at independence, a crime
punishable by a long prison term.
