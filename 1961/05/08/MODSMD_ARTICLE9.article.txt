# Laos Rebels Occupy Village Near Capital

### 
VIENTIANE (UPD—Rebel Pa
thet Lao troops occupied the vil
lage of Ban Lat Hane, 14 miles
north of Luang Prabang, yester
day in force and a battle in the
area could be expected at any mo
ment, reliable sources said today.
Two battalions, estimated at 700
men, took the town and were re
ported advancing down the Me
kong River towards the royal cap
ital.
The action was interpreted as
an attempt to consolidate territory
under Pathet Lao control before
the beginning of the supervisory
activities of the International Con
trol Commission which was due to
arrive in Laos yesterday.
There was no indication that the
rebels would try to capture Luang
| Prabang. But the possibility they
are moving towards an engage
ment with the government garri
son just north of there pointed up
the fragile nature of the cease fire
which is not yet one week old.
A battle, if any, would take
place at Pak Ou, six miles south
east of Ban Lat Hane. Both towns
, are situated on the north bank of
I the Mekong which runs west to
| east at that point before curving
j southwards to Luang Prabang.

The sources said several skir
mishes have been reported in the
area since the cease lire went into
effect “on all fronts.” Government
casualties numbered four killed.
