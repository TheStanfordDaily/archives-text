'A GUIDE FOR THE DATELESS’?
With the cost of dating rising higher and higher it is no wonder
that so many of us men are turning to discus throwing. Natur
ally, we would prefer nuzzling warm coeds to flinging cold
disci, but who’s got that kind of money? Prices being what they
are, the average man today has a simple choice: dating or eating.
l idess the average man happens to be Finster Sigafoos.
Finster came to college with the normal ambition of any
average man: he wanted to find the prettiest coed on campus
and make her his. He looked long and carefully, and at last he
found her—a tall job named Kretchma Inskip, with hair like
beaten gold.
He asked her for a date. She accepted. He appeared at her
sorority house that night, smiling, eager, and carrying a bouquet
of modestly priced flowers.
“Now then,” said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy flora to a
pledge, “where are we going tonight?”
Finster was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared an attractive plan for this evening. “How would you
like to go out to the Ag campus and see the milking machine?”
he asked.
“Ick,” she replied.
“Well, what would you like to do?” he asked.
“Come,” said she, “to a funny little place I know just outside
of town.”
And away they went.

The place was Millionaires Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was filled with beautiful ladies in backless
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Original Rembrandts adorned
the walls. Marlboro trays adorned the cigarette girls. Chained
to each table was a gypsy violinist.
Finster and Kretchma were seated. “I,” said Kretchma to
the waiter, “will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I will have
lobster and capon in maderia sauce with asparagus spears. For
dessert I will have melon stuffed with money.”
“And you, Sir?” said the waiter to Finster.
“Just bring me a pack of Marlboros,” replied Finster, “for
if ever a man needed to settle back and enjoy the mild benefi
cence of choice tobacco and easy-drawing filtration, it is the
shattered hulk you see before you now.”
So, smoking the best of all possible cigarettes, Finster watched
Kretchma ingest her meal and calculated that every time her
fetching young Adam’s apple rose and fell, he was out another
Then he took her home.
It was while saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant
idea. “Listen!” he cried excitedly. “I just had a wonderful
notion. Next time we go out, let’s go Dutch treat!”
Byway of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her housemother and stormed into the house.
“Well, the heck with her,” said Finster to himself. “She is
just a gold digger and lam w r ell rid of her. lam sure there are
many girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will understand
the justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much
money from home as men, so what could be more fair than
sharing expenses on a date?”
With good heart and high hopes, Finster began a search for
a girl who would appreciate the equity of Dutch treat, and you
will be pleased to hear that he soon found one—Mary Alice
Hematoma, a lovely three-legged girl with sideburns.

It was while saying goodnight that Finster got his brilliant
idea. “Listen!” he cried excitedly. “I just had a wonderful
notion. Next time we go out, let’s go Dutch treat!”
Byway of reply, Kretchma slashed him across the face with
her housemother and stormed into the house.
“Well, the heck with her,” said Finster to himself. “She is
just a gold digger and lam w r ell rid of her. lam sure there are
many girls just as beautiful as Kretchma who will understand
the justice of my position. For after all, girls get as much
money from home as men, so what could be more fair than
sharing expenses on a date?”

'A GUIDE FOR THE DATELESS’?
With the cost of dating rising higher and higher it is no wonder
that so many of us men are turning to discus throwing. Natur
ally, we would prefer nuzzling warm coeds to flinging cold
disci, but who’s got that kind of money? Prices being what they
are, the average man today has a simple choice: dating or eating.
l idess the average man happens to be Finster Sigafoos.
Finster came to college with the normal ambition of any
average man: he wanted to find the prettiest coed on campus
and make her his. He looked long and carefully, and at last he
found her—a tall job named Kretchma Inskip, with hair like
beaten gold.
He asked her for a date. She accepted. He appeared at her
sorority house that night, smiling, eager, and carrying a bouquet
of modestly priced flowers.
“Now then,” said Kretchma, tossing the sleazy flora to a
pledge, “where are we going tonight?”
Finster was a man short on cash, but long on ideas. He had
prepared an attractive plan for this evening. “How would you
like to go out to the Ag campus and see the milking machine?”
he asked.
“Ick,” she replied.
“Well, what would you like to do?” he asked.
“Come,” said she, “to a funny little place I know just outside
of town.”
And away they went.

The place was Millionaires Roost, a simple country inn made
of solid ivory. It was filled with beautiful ladies in backless
gowns, handsome men in dickeys. Original Rembrandts adorned
the walls. Marlboro trays adorned the cigarette girls. Chained
to each table was a gypsy violinist.
Finster and Kretchma were seated. “I,” said Kretchma to
the waiter, “will start with shrimps remoulade. Then I will have
lobster and capon in maderia sauce with asparagus spears. For
dessert I will have melon stuffed with money.”
“And you, Sir?” said the waiter to Finster.
