# Liberal Group Put Off Campus At S.F. State

### 
A liberal political group booted
off campus at San Francisco State
College is fighting to be allowed
back on.
SCOPE (Student Committee on
Politics and Education) was
stripped of official campus recog
nition last week by the student
Congress of Organizations (COO)
after a speech by Frank Wilkin
son and a pro-Cuba rally.
SCOPE sponsored the on-cam
pus talk by Wilkinson—who is
now in Jail for pleading the First
Amendment when he appeared be
fore the House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee.

Prof. Robert Hall, faculty ad
viser to the group, said SCOPE
didn’t indorse Wilkinson’s stand,
but felt he should be allowed to
air his views.
Hall declared that SCOPE took
no position on the Cuban invasion,
but that student members attend
ed the pro-Cuba rally on campus
to see what was going on. SCOPE
did not sponsor the rally.
COO charged, in expelling the
group, that SCOPE had partici
pated in unauthorized off-campus
activities and had put notices on
bulletin boards wtihout permis
sion, among other mistakes.
HALL termed this “false and
pretentious.”

But SCOPE plans to appeal for
help to the college administration,
the California Federation of
Teachers fAKL-CTOt and maybe
the American Civil Liberties
Union.
