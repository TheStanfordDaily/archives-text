# Medal, Hero’s Welcome For Shepard in Capital
## Astronaut Paid Tribute By Kennedy, Congress 
### 
WASHINGTON— (UPI) —America's first spaceman harvested a
hero's reward in this unashamedly worshipping capital yesterday.
His wife, who has seen him seldom in recent weeks, kissed him.
His president, John F. Kennedy, clasped him by the hand and pinned
a medal on him.

A quarter of a million Ameri
cans lined the streets to cheer
and cry and cheer again as he
rode from the White House to
the Capitol. On Capiiol Hill mem
bers of Congress paid him tribute.
IN THK State Department aud
itorium 500 reporters rose and
gave him an ovation, a thing re
porters seldom do.

But Cmdr. Alan B. Shepard Jr.,
pilot of the spaceship “Freedom
7,” refused to accept it all for
himself. To the President, to the
Congress, to the reporters he said
it was not he hut “we’’ who did
the thing they were praising him
for.

“I am acutely aware,” he said,
“of the hundreds of individuals
who made this flight possible.”

IT WAS TRUK, of course, that
Alan B. Shepard of East Deny,
N.H., was not alone responsible
for last Friday’s “perfect space
flight” from Cape Canaveral, Fla.

But as Robert R. Gilruth, direc
tor of the Mercury man-in-space
project, said, it was Alan B. Shep
ard “who really broke the ice for
all of us.” and showed America
the way into the great new fron
tier of space.
So it was to Alan Shepard that
President Kennedy gave the dis
tinguished Service Medal of the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, NASA’s highest
award. And it was to Alan Shep
ard that this capital city gave its
heart yesterday.
AT 7:34 AM. PDT last Friday,
Shepard rode a rocket-boosted
Mercury capsule on a 15-minute
trip which carried him 115 miles
above the Atlantic Ocean and 302
miles down the Atlantic missile
range.

It was history’s first flight,
however brief, of a pilot-con
trolled spacecraft. It also was the
first vital, life-risking act in this
country’s long-range program to
explore the moon and planets and
the voids in between.

If you believe Shepard, it was
strictly a “no sweat" operation.
Everything had been planned out
to the last detail. There was a
moment of “apprehension” be
fore liftoff, but everything worked
fine, and there were no bad mo
ments during the flight.
NEVERTHELESS, Shepard’s
countrymen were thrilled. So, un
der orders from the President,
Shepard flow back here from his
temporary post-flight refuge on
Grand Bahama Island for yester
day’s reception.
Flying with him were the other
six Mercury astronauts. At An
drews Air Force Base in nearby
Maryland, where they landed,
Shepard was last off the plane.
At the foot of the ramp, wait
ing to meet him was his wife,
Louise, his parents, of East Der
ry; his sister and his wife’s father
and mother.
THERE WERE kisses and hand
shakes before the helicopter
flights to the White House south
lawn where President and Mrs.
Kennedy greeted the party.

The citation read by the Presi
dent and hero. The President even
dent said Shepard’s “flight as the
first United States astronaut was
an outstanding contribution to
th e advancement of hum an
knowledge and space technology
and a demonstration of man’s
capabilities in suborbital space
flights.”

Actually, the ceremony wasn’t
all that pompous. Kennedy and
Shepard shook hands more like
college classmates than like presi
dent and hero. The president even
managed to drop the medal on
the ground and to forget, for a
moment, to pin it on the hero’s
lapel.
THIiRK WAS laughter and gai
ety, And Kennedy paid a graceful
tribute to the other astronauts
and to the high NASA officials
who had thought up Project Mer
cury and carried it through to
this point.

knowledge and space technology
and a demonstration of man’s
capabilities in suborbital space
flights.”

Actually, the ceremony wasn’t
all that pompous. Kennedy and
Shepard shook hands more like
college classmates than like presi
dent and hero. The president even
managed to drop the medal on
the ground and to forget, for a
moment, to pin it on the hero’s
lapel.
THIiRK WAS laughter and gai
ety, And Kennedy paid a graceful
tribute to the other astronauts
and to the high NASA officials
who had thought up Project Mer
cury and carried it through to

WASHINGTON— (UPI) —America's first spaceman harvested a
hero's reward in this unashamedly worshipping capital yesterday.
His wife, who has seen him seldom in recent weeks, kissed him.
His president, John F. Kennedy, clasped him by the hand and pinned
a medal on him.

A quarter of a million Ameri
cans lined the streets to cheer
and cry and cheer again as he
rode from the White House to
the Capitol. On Capiiol Hill mem
bers of Congress paid him tribute.
IN THK State Department aud
itorium 500 reporters rose and
gave him an ovation, a thing re
porters seldom do.

But Cmdr. Alan B. Shepard Jr.,
pilot of the spaceship “Freedom
7,” refused to accept it all for
himself. To the President, to the
Congress, to the reporters he said
it was not he hut “we’’ who did
the thing they were praising him
for.

“I am acutely aware,” he said,
“of the hundreds of individuals
who made this flight possible.”

IT WAS TRUK, of course, that
Alan B. Shepard of East Deny,
N.H., was not alone responsible
for last Friday’s “perfect space
flight” from Cape Canaveral, Fla.

But as Robert R. Gilruth, direc
tor of the Mercury man-in-space
project, said, it was Alan B. Shep
ard “who really broke the ice for
all of us.” and showed America
the way into the great new fron
tier of space.
So it was to Alan Shepard that
President Kennedy gave the dis
tinguished Service Medal of the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, NASA’s highest
award. And it was to Alan Shep
ard that this capital city gave its
heart yesterday.
AT 7:34 AM. PDT last Friday,
Shepard rode a rocket-boosted
Mercury capsule on a 15-minute
trip which carried him 115 miles
above the Atlantic Ocean and 302
miles down the Atlantic missile
range.

It was history’s first flight,
however brief, of a pilot-con
trolled spacecraft. It also was the
first vital, life-risking act in this
country’s long-range program to
explore the moon and planets and
the voids in between.

If you believe Shepard, it was
strictly a “no sweat" operation.
Everything had been planned out
to the last detail. There was a
moment of “apprehension” be
fore liftoff, but everything worked
fine, and there were no bad mo
ments during the flight.
NEVERTHELESS, Shepard’s
countrymen were thrilled. So, un
der orders from the President,
Shepard flow back here from his
temporary post-flight refuge on
Grand Bahama Island for yester
day’s reception.
Flying with him were the other
six Mercury astronauts. At An
drews Air Force Base in nearby
Maryland, where they landed,
Shepard was last off the plane.
At the foot of the ramp, wait
ing to meet him was his wife,
Louise, his parents, of East Der
ry; his sister and his wife’s father
and mother.
THERE WERE kisses and hand
shakes before the helicopter
flights to the White House south
lawn where President and Mrs.
Kennedy greeted the party.

The citation read by the Presi
dent and hero. The President even

first United States astronaut was
an outstanding contribution to
th e advancement of hum an

and a demonstration of man’s

drews Air Force Base in nearby
Maryland, where they landed,
Shepard was last off the plane.
At the foot of the ramp, wait
ing to meet him was his wife,
Louise, his parents, of East Der
ry; his sister and his wife’s father
and mother.
THERE WERE kisses and hand
shakes before the helicopter
flights to the White House south
lawn where President and Mrs.
Kennedy greeted the party.

The citation read by the Presi
dent and hero. The President even
dent said Shepard’s “flight as the
first United States astronaut was
an outstanding contribution to
th e advancement of hum an
knowledge and space technology
and a demonstration of man’s
capabilities in suborbital space
flights.”

Actually, the ceremony wasn’t
all that pompous. Kennedy and
Shepard shook hands more like
college classmates than like presi
dent and hero. The president even
managed to drop the medal on
the ground and to forget, for a
moment, to pin it on the hero’s
lapel.
THIiRK WAS laughter and gai
ety, And Kennedy paid a graceful
tribute to the other astronauts
and to the high NASA officials
who had thought up Project Mer
cury and carried it through to
this point.
