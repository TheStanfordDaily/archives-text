ELISABETHVILLE, The Congo
(UPD - South African mercena
ries began deserting the Katanga
army yesterday as the central
government in Leopoldville laid
plans for the trial of Katanga
President Moise Tshombe on trea
son and murder charges.
A spokesman for the Katanga
government accused the white
troops of “deserting when the go
ing got too tough.” The mercena
ries placed themselves under the
protection of the United Nations
and were expected to bo flown to
Leopoldville for questioning.
THK C’HARGKS against Tsh
ombe include murdering Patrice
Lumumba and slaughtering Ba
luba tribesmen. The white mer
cenaries led the attacks against
the Balubas in northern Katanga
Pi’ovince.

(In Leopoldville U.N. Secretary
General Dag Hammarskjold was
reported to have demanded the
Congolese government punish the
troops who cut down 42 U.N. sol
diers at Port Francqui last month.
The demand was given to Presi
dent Joseph Kasavubu in Coquil
hatville where Tshombe is hold.

(The U.N. troops were shot up
by Congolese soldiers April 27.
The official toll is 42 missing and
all are feared dead. Hammarsk
joid said the guilty Congolese
must be brought to trial.)

Elisabothville itself was quiet
despite reports Tshombo would
be tried on charges that could
bring the death penalty. Top offi
cials appeared unworried.
ONE OFFICIAL said a trial of
Tshombe might not have the re
sult the Kasavubu government of
Leopoldville wanted. Ho said Kas
avubu and his premier Joseph
Ileo were heavily involved in Lu
mumba’s transfer to Katanga.

The official said Tshombe never
wanted custody of the former
premier and that the first he
know of his arrival was when the
plane carrying Lumumba re
quested permission to land at Elis
abethville.
Meanwhile, the absence of Brit
ish, South African and other mer
cenaries from the streets of Elisa
bet hviHe strengthened the impres
sion the government sent them
out of town to avoid a possible
roundup by U.N. forces.
