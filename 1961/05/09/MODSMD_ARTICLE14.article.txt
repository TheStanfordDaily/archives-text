# HCUA Foes Weaken Democratic System

### 
Following the acquittal of Robert Meisenbach on charges aris
ing out of last May's Un-American Activity Committee riots, the
opponents of the committee have termed the acquittal a victory over
the committee.

Their statements have succeeded somewhat in obscuring an
accurate summation of the trial, provided by San Francisco's Mayor
George Christopher. "This matter only decided whether or not a
particular party was involved in one phase of the incident."

The key result of the Meisenbach acquittal has not been either
a victory or the decision of one phase, but rather an addition to the
aura of martyrdom which surrounds those who participated in the
riots. The students have taken on a mantle of respectability, even
though they blatantly broke the law. Because they were committed
to a cause which they and their supporters felt just and right, this
group feels their actions should be interpreted above the law.
This attitude can be employed only in undemocratic countries.
The student riots which toppled governments in Korea and Turkey
can be sanctioned only because the traditional channels of opinion
—the press, pressure on legislators, radio-television, right-to-petition,
orderly picketing—were all unavailable.
This was not the case in San Francisco last May. All channels
were open to the opponents of the committee, but they did not
follow democratic processes. Instead they translated their disap
proval of the committee into actions which challenged the public
order.

We did not feel sorry for them in May and we feel no sympathy
for them a year later. In that year they have condoned the defiance
of the orders of uniformed policemen and have approved of mob
force to gain admittance to a Congressional committee. Their self
righteousness has been bolstered with an error-packed movie ver
sion of the riots and by the McCarthy smear tactics of the far right.
They have repeatedly said that they were trying to improve the
democratic system, when by their actions against authority they
actually contributed to its decay.
