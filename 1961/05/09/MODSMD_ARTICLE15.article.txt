## Election Laws Must Guard Against Fraud 
### 
We have still to tighten the elec
tion laws against fraud and care
lessness and, even more impor
tant, to provide for real enforce
ment.

There are two essential ingredi
ents for this reform.

The first is for Republicans and
Democrats to quit pointing at
each other as the guilty one. Both
should recognize that better en
forcement of the election laws
will benefit everyone by insuring
that every vote will count.
THERE is no doubt that over
the years both parties have en
gaged in illegal and unfair prac
tices at the polling booths, voting
dead men and counting out the
living.
But no party has had a mono
poly on these evils.
Obviously when a national elec
tion is as tight as last fall, the
very fact that some 3,000,000
Americans were deprived of their
ballots, undermines confidence in
the democratic process and un
derlines the need for reform. In
terparty recrimination, however,
will get us nowhere. The assump
tion that one party is more culp
able than the other will simply de
lay reform. Mr. Nixon might
have picked up strength if all the
votes had been secure, but it is
also true that President Kennedy
might have won by a greater plu
rality.
THE SECOND ingredient for
election reform is for the Republi
can and Democratic parties to re
cruit and train adequate man
power to guard the polls. Rep.
William B. Widnall, R., of Now
Jersey, has a helpful suggestion.
He says: “It appears to me that
a tremendous service could be
performed by some of the col
leges in providing watchers and
challengers for election day.”
This goes to the heart of the
problem. The greatest protection
to the integrity of the ballot—
safeguarding both the right to
vote and the fairness of the count
—comes from the ability of the
two parties to put competent, vol
untary workers at every polling
place in every district in every
state. In areas where one party

is weak, adequate watchers are
unavailable. Often they are un
trained, do not know the laws, are
quite useless. Many of the worst
abuses at the polls stem from this
inadequacy.
How can the parties get compe
tent election watchers in ade
quate number?

It seems to me that a right and
workable answer is staring us in
the face: Why not a political
peace corps of volunteer college
students? They would gladly give
their services in at least one elec
tion. They would serve the better
functioning of democracy in the
U.S. the way the international
peace corps is preparing to help
build democracy In other coun
tries.

ON THE BASIS of conversa
tions with undergraduates on
many campuses, I am sure that
largo numbers of college students
would be willing and eager to vol
unteer if given a significant job
to do. They would need to receive
special training because untrained
poll watchers are helpless. Many
would themselves like to get into
politics. Service in the political
peace corps would be a good be
ginning.

The Democratic and Republican
National Chairmen, San. Thrus
ton Morton and John Bailey,
ought to realize, if they don’t al
ready, that voter opinion is very
sensitive about fraud and care
lessness at the polls.
The completely non-partisan
study, “Are You a Shadow Vo
ter?”—put out by the Women’s
Division of the Republican Na
tional Committee—has created a
nationwide stir. Political and non
political organizations, including
the League of Women Voters and
the Fair Campaign Practices Com
mittee, have been distributing
copies by the thousands in all the
states.
MR. MORTON and Mr. Bailey
need not to leave the initiative to
others. The need for action is evi
dent and it seems to me that the
political peace corps is a large
part of the right answer.

living.
But no party has had a mono
poly on these evils.
Obviously when a national elec
tion is as tight as last fall, the
very fact that some 3,000,000
Americans were deprived of their
ballots, undermines confidence in
the democratic process and un
derlines the need for reform. In
terparty recrimination, however,
will get us nowhere. The assump
tion that one party is more culp
able than the other will simply de
lay reform. Mr. Nixon might
have picked up strength if all the
votes had been secure, but it is
also true that President Kennedy
might have won by a greater plu
rality.
THE SECOND ingredient for
election reform is for the Republi
can and Democratic parties to re
cruit and train adequate man
power to guard the polls. Rep.
William B. Widnall, R., of Now
Jersey, has a helpful suggestion.
He says: “It appears to me that
a tremendous service could be
performed by some of the col
leges in providing watchers and
challengers for election day.”
This goes to the heart of the
problem. The greatest protection
to the integrity of the ballot—
safeguarding both the right to
vote and the fairness of the count
—comes from the ability of the
two parties to put competent, vol
untary workers at every polling
place in every district in every
state. In areas where one party

is weak, adequate watchers are
unavailable. Often they are un
trained, do not know the laws, are
quite useless. Many of the worst
abuses at the polls stem from this
inadequacy.
How can the parties get compe
tent election watchers in ade
quate number?

It seems to me that a right and
workable answer is staring us in
the face: Why not a political
peace corps of volunteer college
students? They would gladly give
their services in at least one elec
tion. They would serve the better
functioning of democracy in the
U.S. the way the international
peace corps is preparing to help
build democracy In other coun
tries.

ON THE BASIS of conversa
tions with undergraduates on
many campuses, I am sure that
largo numbers of college students
would be willing and eager to vol
unteer if given a significant job
to do. They would need to receive
special training because untrained
poll watchers are helpless. Many
would themselves like to get into
politics. Service in the political
peace corps would be a good be
ginning.

The Democratic and Republican
National Chairmen, San. Thrus
ton Morton and John Bailey,
ought to realize, if they don’t al
ready, that voter opinion is very
sensitive about fraud and care
lessness at the polls.
The completely non-partisan
study, “Are You a Shadow Vo
ter?”—put out by the Women’s
Division of the Republican Na
tional Committee—has created a
nationwide stir. Political and non
political organizations, including
the League of Women Voters and
the Fair Campaign Practices Com
mittee, have been distributing
copies by the thousands in all the

MR. MORTON and Mr. Bailey

We have still to tighten the elec
tion laws against fraud and care
lessness and, even more impor
tant, to provide for real enforce
ment.

There are two essential ingredi
ents for this reform.

The first is for Republicans and
Democrats to quit pointing at
each other as the guilty one. Both
should recognize that better en
forcement of the election laws
will benefit everyone by insuring
that every vote will count.
THERE is no doubt that over
the years both parties have en

dead men and counting out the
living.
