### Ken Dery 
Assorted Items

If Boston Rod Sox outfielder Jackie Jensen needed psychiatric and
hypnotic help before, he’ll require a whole entourage of problem
soothers when the bench jockies get through with him. . . .
Another who recently joined the growing list of athletes attempt
ing to make peace with their minds is golfer Ken Venturi. Venturi
Is having trouble sinking putts and tried hypnosis at Las Vegas in
an attempt to correct the situation. . .
SAM SNEAD just tw'o weeks short of his 49th birthday—walked
off with 10,000 silver dollars for winning last week’s Las Vegas
Tournament of Champions. Snead never could do much out in the
desert before, and he was not one of the top favorites. It seems that
the powerful swinger, with the perpetual straw’ hat, w'as alw'ays a
little too dazzled by the night lights and the tinkle of chips to be a
serious contender in years past. This year Slammin’ Sam went to
bed early. . .

Speaking of the Vegas tourney
it seems that Jay Hebert pre
dicted before the first day’s shoot
ing that he had finally discovered
how to play the game. Handsome
Jay, 38, made his prediction look
good by leading the field through
36 holes, but fell victim to the
wildly erratic wind on the third
day and could only manage a
78. . .
Hebert’s brother Lionel an
other of the top touring pros—-
was credited with helping teach
Jay a few of the finer points. Lio
nel took 81 strokes the last day.
That’s the way the game of golf
seems to go the minute you
think you have it conquered it
humbles you, but good. . .

ARNOLD PALMER is creat
ing more of a legend every time
he tees off. If he isn’t coming
from fleep in the pack to win it,

he is scrambling with the duffers. The muscular Palmer recorded a
nine on one hole at Las Vegas when he got in some tall grass (he
could hardly see the ball> and chose to slash it out. It took a clutch
12 footer to keep golf’s all-time highest single season money winner
out of double figures. Undaunted Arnie birdied the next hole. . .

Cunliffe Runs Again

Saturday’s West Coast Relays at Fresno should be one of the
outstanding track events of this season. Former Stanford Stars
Ernie Cunliffe and John Kelly will lie competing in the mile and the
hop, step, jump respectively. -. . . Cunliffe has been working out
under the watchful eye of Coach Payton Jordan.

It is rumored that Navy’s grid hero, Joe Bellino, may never play
pro sports of any kind. The diminutive line smasher injured his
shoulder on that story-book catch late in the fourth quarter of last
year’s Orange Bowl game and the ailment has persisted. In addition
to his football talents Bellino was a slugging catcher and had numer
ous major league offers. . .

TIIK 12-MAN amateur basketball team that represented the
United States on an eight-game tour of the Soviet Union went un
defeated. The final game was last Sunday with the United States
Some of the male players were Jerry Lucas of Ohio State; Ben
team easily trouncing the Russian All-Stars by a score of 87-65.
Warley, John Barnhill, Roger Taylor, Dan Swartz and Jack
Adams of the NBL and AAU champion, Cleveland Pipers; and Paid
Neumann, former Stanford captain and top guard of the New York
Tapers of the National Basketball League. . .
The U.S. women all-stars played their female opponents about
even in their series. . .
