## Fulbright Chances Good at Stanford 
### MIKE SAKS 
Stanford students are missing out on a great opportunity when
they don't apply for Fulbright scholarships. This is the strong con
viction of Associate Prof. Martin B. Travis Jr. of the Political Science
Department, campus coordinator for the program.

“Harvard had 160 applications
last year while Stanford had only
40. Yet 41 per cent of the 40
who applied from Stanford ac
cepted this year,” stated Travis.
“With this fine percentage, we
should have many more appli
cants.”

He believes that a lack of pub
licity around campus, partly due
to advisers, is the major cause
of the small number of applica
tions.

FULBRIGHT scholarships arc
granted in a great number of
countries. They are open to both
graduates and undergraduates.
There is no competition between
the two groups. Each receives an
equal amount of Fulbright funds.
“Fulbright scholarships are
open to all fields of study at Stan
ford,’’ said Travis. Applications
are due Oct. 20 this year but it
is a good idea to make plans now,
INFORMATION and applica
tions may be picked up at Tra
vis' office (21H) in two weks.

Although there is a condition
on the scholarship that excludes
persons who wish to study in a
country where they have previ
ously lived for over three months,
students who have attended Stan
ford’s overseas campuses can ap
ply for national grants. These are
almost identical to the scholar
ships, Travis stated.
“Don’t be scared to apply,” Tra
vis emphasized. Stanford has an
excellent record of acceptances.
England, the most difficult place
to be accepted for, will see three
Stanford students next year.

I) U K TO THE competition,
grade points for England are high
(3.3', but lower grade points will
suffice for less sought-after
countries.

“Graduating seniors have a bet
ter chance for acceptance than
graduate students,” according to
Sandra Levinson, a teaching
assistant in the Political Science
Department and a 1958-59 Ful
bright scholar to England.
Besides, the scholarships are
more than adequate to live on,
she said.

For her nine months in Eng
land she received $ 10 a week, $l5O
for books, tuition and roundtrip
transportation. “Because my ex
penses were only eight, dollars
a week, I was able to travel

abroad for many months on the
money I saved,” Miss Levinson
said.

she said.

For her nine months in Eng
land she received $ 10 a week, $l5O
for books, tuition and roundtrip
transportation. “Because my ex
penses were only eight, dollars
a week, I was able to travel

abroad for many months on the
money I saved,” Miss Levinson
said.
Stanford students are missing out on a great opportunity when
they don't apply for Fulbright scholarships. This is the strong con
viction of Associate Prof. Martin B. Travis Jr. of the Political Science
Department, campus coordinator for the program.

“Harvard had 160 applications
last year while Stanford had only
40. Yet 41 per cent of the 40
who applied from Stanford ac
cepted this year,” stated Travis.
“With this fine percentage, we
should have many more appli
cants.”

He believes that a lack of pub
licity around campus, partly due
to advisers, is the major cause
of the small number of applica
tions.

FULBRIGHT scholarships arc
granted in a great number of
countries. They are open to both
graduates and undergraduates.
There is no competition between
the two groups. Each receives an
equal amount of Fulbright funds.
“Fulbright scholarships are
open to all fields of study at Stan
ford,’’ said Travis. Applications
are due Oct. 20 this year but it
is a good idea to make plans now,
INFORMATION and applica
tions may be picked up at Tra
vis' office (21H) in two weks.

Although there is a condition
on the scholarship that excludes
persons who wish to study in a
country where they have previ
ously lived for over three months,
students who have attended Stan
ford’s overseas campuses can ap
ply for national grants. These are
almost identical to the scholar
ships, Travis stated.
“Don’t be scared to apply,” Tra
vis emphasized. Stanford has an
excellent record of acceptances.
England, the most difficult place
to be accepted for, will see three
Stanford students next year.

I) U K TO THE competition,
grade points for England are high
(3.3', but lower grade points will
suffice for less sought-after
countries.

“Graduating seniors have a bet
ter chance for acceptance than
graduate students,” according to
Sandra Levinson, a teaching
assistant in the Political Science
Department and a 1958-59 Ful
bright scholar to England.
Besides, the scholarships are
more than adequate to live on,
she said.
