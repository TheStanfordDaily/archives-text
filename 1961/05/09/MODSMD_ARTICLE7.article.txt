# PREP SCIENCE:
## Can't Convey Information on Understanding 
### JANET ROSS 
High school science courses
“simply cannot convey enough in
formation and understanding to
enable the individual to compre
hend modern technology,” Leon
ard I. Schiff, head of the physics
department, told an audience at a
recent Stanford alumni confer
ence.
Science courses in secondary
school should present the student
with an “orderly, rational view of
the natural world” and “should be
thought of as cultural courses
rather than as ‘tool’ subjects,” he
said. When preparatory courses
attempt more than this, he claims,
they become “a collection of unre
lated. undigested rules and facts.”
SCHIFF especially approves of
the current trend toward stress
ing the discovery of scientific
principles by the student, but
holds that “specialization should
lie left to the university.”

“The typical entering college
freshman of the not-too distant fu
ture,” he predicted. “ will know
how to express himself correctly,
clearly and interestingly in writ
ing.
In addition, the frosh “will be
able to read, write, speak and un
derstand a foreign language at an
intermediate level and will be well
enough prepared in mathematics
to start a college calculus course,”
Schiff prognosticated.

THE EDUCATION of both the
future scientist and non-scientist
should be the same at elementary
and secondary school levels. “Pre
college education,” Schiff says,
“should devote itself to the devel
opment of the basic skills re
quired for the conduct of life and
to an introduction to the cultural
appreciation required for the en
joyment of life.”

Certain courses, of course, must
be taught as “tool subjects” be
fore college, Schiff says, including
English, math and foreign lan
guages.
