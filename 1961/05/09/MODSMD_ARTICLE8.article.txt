# Laotian Rebels Threaten Truce

### 
VIENTIANE (UPD—A series
of Communist attacks falling .just
short of a major offensive and a
Red thrust to within 14 miles of
Luang Prabang threatened yes
terday to shatter the fragile Lao
tian truce.

The first contingent of the
three-nation international com
mission formed to oversee the
five-day-old cease fire arrived at
the same airport yesterday whore
helicopters were unloading
wounded Meo tribesmen guerril
las, victims of new Communist
attacks.

Government and rebel negotia
tors met again at the truce village
of Hin Heap. 50 miles north of
Vientiane, but their three hour
and five-minute meeting was de
voted almost entirely to an acri
monious exchange of charges of
truce violations. No agreement
was reached.

At the same time, the govern
ment made public a new series of
rebel demands that the govern
ment withdraw troops from the
Hin Heup area. The rebels also
accused the government of “fol
lowing” a Soviet transport plane
and opening fire in four provinces.

Informed sources said about 700
rebels occupied the village of Lai
Hane Sunday, apparently with a
fight, and started moving down
the Mekong River toward Luang
Prabang.

There was no indication the
rebels would try to Invade the
royal capital itself but there was
a possibility they would clash
with a government garrison at
Pak On. about six miles from Lat
Hane.
