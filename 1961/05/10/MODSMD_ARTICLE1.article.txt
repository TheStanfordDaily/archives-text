# Senate Approves Kennedy Program For Latin America
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPl)—The Senate last night passed a $5OO mil
lion measure to finance the first step of President Kennedy's pro
gram to help Latin American nations help themselves.
Included in the measure—which now goes back to the House
for a final agreement—was another $lOO million to assist Chile back

on its feet in the wake of last
year’s disastrous earthquakes.
THE AID program was pro
posed last year by former Presi
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower, atrd
Congress passed a measure auth
oriing it before adjournment late
last summer.
President Kennedy accepted the
measure as-was but told Congress
he planned to use it as the base
for a broader long-range program
to help wipe out poverty, disease
and ignorance in the hemisphere.
Before passing the bill, the Sen
ate tacked on an amendment
which would put a ceiling of 8 per
cent on interest that could be
charged on any 'oans made under
the program.
THE HOUSE, which did not fix
any interest ceiling, was expected
to refer the measure to a House-
Senate conference committee to
work out a compromise.
The Senate adopted the interest
amendment, offered by Sen. John
F. Williams, R.-Del., after exten
sive debate. Then it passed the
main bill by voice vote.
Williams argued that the ceil
ing was needed to keep recipient
countries from being charged the
excessive interest rates now prev
alent in much of South and Cen
tral America.
THE PRESIDENT would have
virtually unlimited authority over
use of the $5OO million aid fund,
which would finance the program
for the remainder of this fiscal
year.
Senate Democratic Whip Hu
bert H. Humphrey said the meas
ure provided “the best way and
the democratic way to prevent the
spread of Castro-brand revolution
in the hemisphere.”
On the Republican side. Sen.
Francis Case, N.J., said the Cuban
crisis may have been worthwhile
if it has “developed our resource
fulness to develop the capabilities
of the other free Latin American
countries.”

SEN. HOMER Capchart, R.-Ind.,
opposed the measure on grounds
it lacked adequate controls over
the way the money will be spent.

Sen. Henry C. Dworshak, R.-
Idaho, said the outlay would be
the start of a 10-year program
that would “contribute to the
bankruptcy of our country.”

But Sen. Jacob K. Javits, R,-
N.Y., objected to the bill on oppo
site grounds- that it should be at
least doubled.
