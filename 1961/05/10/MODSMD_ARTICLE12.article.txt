# Actual Situation

### 
In the Daily editorial “Russ
Arms, Political Buildup in Cuba’’
(April 271, Roscoe Drummond
poses a “hard and painful dilem
ma.’’ “Do we continue to stand
aside and watch the mounting
build up of Soviet power in Cuba?
Or do we act alone . . If you
accept Mr. Drummond’s conten
tion that “We are witnessing the
steady build up of Soviet military
and political power in the West
ern hemispher-e” and “the spread
of Communist dictatorship,” it
seems you must embrace the di
lemma. But does this describe the
actual situation in Cuba?
That it does seems to be taken
for granted in most of the think
ing in this country at the present
time. But that Cuba poses a seri
ous threat to our security and to
the solidarity of the western hem
isphere—isn’t this just the impor
tant question at issue, rather than
something to be taken as a fore
gone conclusion? What informa
tion supports the belief that in
Cuba we witness “the steady
build-up of Soviet military and po
litical power?” I can think of
three commonly known facts
which may explain this belief in
the popular mind.
First, and I suppose most im
portant, the arms shipments from
iron-curtain countries. I, too, was
concerned about these shipments,
and thought all the Cuban charges
of invasion during the past year
were just a cover-up. But now we
realize that the Cuban charges
were true! Now it would be an
interesting species of double-think
to suppose that the Cubans’ at
tempt to prepare themselves for
this invasion constituted a threat
to our security. And incidentally,
can we reasonably expect the Cu
bans to do anything else but con
tinue an arms build-up, if we con
tinue to talk intervention?
Second, Cuba is receiving tech
nical and financial aid from Rus
sia. Well, so are India, Egypt, and
some of the new countries in Af
rica.
Third, the government is carry
ing out a program of land reform
similar to those in Communist
countries. This, I suppose, ex
plains a lot of the suspicion and
hostility toward Cuba in this
country, but has no bearing on
the point at issue.
There must be other facts about
the Cuban situation which sup
port the contention that it is be
coming some sort of Soviet satel
lite. What are they? I suggest
that the whole question of
whether Cuba poses a military
and political threat to this hemis
phere, and to what extent, is a
question which should be opened
up for public discussion, not de
cided on in advance in our think
ing about Cuba.

In the Daily editorial “Russ
Arms, Political Buildup in Cuba’’
(April 271, Roscoe Drummond
poses a “hard and painful dilem
ma.’’ “Do we continue to stand
aside and watch the mounting
build up of Soviet power in Cuba?
Or do we act alone . . If you
accept Mr. Drummond’s conten
tion that “We are witnessing the
steady build up of Soviet military
and political power in the West
ern hemispher-e” and “the spread
of Communist dictatorship,” it
seems you must embrace the di
lemma. But does this describe the
actual situation in Cuba?
That it does seems to be taken
for granted in most of the think
ing in this country at the present
time. But that Cuba poses a seri
ous threat to our security and to
the solidarity of the western hem
isphere—isn’t this just the impor
tant question at issue, rather than
something to be taken as a fore
gone conclusion? What informa
tion supports the belief that in
Cuba we witness “the steady
build-up of Soviet military and po
litical power?” I can think of
three commonly known facts
which may explain this belief in
the popular mind.
First, and I suppose most im
portant, the arms shipments from
iron-curtain countries. I, too, was
concerned about these shipments,
and thought all the Cuban charges
of invasion during the past year
were just a cover-up. But now we
realize that the Cuban charges
were true! Now it would be an
interesting species of double-think
to suppose that the Cubans’ at
tempt to prepare themselves for
this invasion constituted a threat
to our security. And incidentally,
can we reasonably expect the Cu
bans to do anything else but con
tinue an arms build-up, if we con
tinue to talk intervention?
Second, Cuba is receiving tech
nical and financial aid from Rus
sia. Well, so are India, Egypt, and
some of the new countries in Af
rica.
Third, the government is carry
ing out a program of land reform
similar to those in Communist
countries. This, I suppose, ex
plains a lot of the suspicion and
hostility toward Cuba in this
country, but has no bearing on
the point at issue.
There must be other facts about
the Cuban situation which sup
port the contention that it is be
coming some sort of Soviet satel
lite. What are they? I suggest
that the whole question of
whether Cuba poses a military
and political threat to this hemis
phere, and to what extent, is a
question which should be opened
up for public discussion, not de
cided on in advance in our think
ing about Cuba.
