# On Gas Chamber
## 
### 
While the world hears with hor
ror once again of the atrocities
committed by Adolph Eichmann
and others like him, the state of
California blandly makes use of
its own gas chamber to execute
Alexander Robillard, and the
State Assembly votes to continue
capital punishment. Although to
draw a parallel between the geno
cide of Nazi Germany and the
“legal” capital punishment of Cal
ifornia may seem unreal, the prin
ciple against both is the same,
namely, that execution, even
though sanctioned by a state for
whatever reason, is an immoral
and degenerate practice for mod
ern nations.

In addition, there is no practi
cal justification for capital pun
ishment. The oft-quoted reason of
prevention of murder or other
capital crimes is fallacious, as
seen by the fact that in no state
where execution has been abol
ished has the homicide rate risen,
and in several states it has since
declined. The expense of main
taining a death row is immense,
and, in many states, greater than
the cost of supporting condemned
prisoners for a term of life im
prisonment. And the argument of
protecting society from criminals
falls through in view of increas
ing, modern rehabilitation meth
ods. Revenge and perhaps an un
conscious sadism seem to be the
only real motives.
The trend for the future aboli
tion of capital punishment looks
promising, for the absurdity and
immorality of execution is becom
ing realized. However, until there
is abolition, California will con
tinue the barbaric use of its gas
chamber, and the rest of the
world will continue to wonder
just how civilized the United
States really is,
