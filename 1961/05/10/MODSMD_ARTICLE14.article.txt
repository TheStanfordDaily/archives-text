# Reject Responsibility
## 
### 
Having followed with interest
the dispute about your editorial
policy, I was glad to read an edi
torial in today’s Daily (May 8,
1961) stating one incontestable
premise: that the bombing of live
Sigma Nu library reveals a de
plorable rejection of social re
sponsibility by the perpetrators of
the “fraternity prank.”
That rejection is indeed deplor
able for two reasons: it discredits
the ethical standards of the per
sons involved, and it brings into
question the value of the disci
plines in higher education. There
have been in the course of this
term three incidents of similar
import. The first was the some
times tasteless debate upon your
actions; the second was the dis
missal of several student govern
ment officials for abuse of office;
the third was the bombing affair.
I am unable to come to any judg
ment upon the first, except that
in the published statements there
has been a great deal more heat
than light.

But the accessible evidence con
cerning the other two incidents is
more explicit and alarming. It
does not concern the community
at large that the personal stand
ards of some of its members are
of such a calibre that they allow
of perverting the offices entrust
ed to them or of wilfully destroy
ing property and jeopardizing the
welfare of others. That is regret
table; but it is in the last analysis
a matter for private reflection.
However, it does concern the Uni
versity community, it must con
cern that community, that the
very purpose for which it exists
has been brought so strongly into
question.

That purpose is to prepare stu
dents to assume the one unalter
able duty of an educated man—to
act with integrity; to cherish free
dom, but to honor responsibility.
One would surely be unfair and
inaccurate in assuming that the
attitudes shown in these two af
fairs represent the attitudes of
most Stanfordians. But it is clear
that those who wish to dissociate
themselves from such attitudes
must now come to an open reaf
firmation of purpose.

The members of the student
government dismissed for wrong
ful conduct were presumably rep
resentatives of the student body,
elected by that body. The previous
incidents mentioned in your edi
torial as being similar to the Sig
ma Nu bombing indicate that the
attitudes shown in that more re
cent affair are not limited to the
seven persons who perpetrated it.
If the Stanford students as a
whole disavow these attitudes,
that must now be made evident.
And. on the other hand, if they
wish to discard the principle of
freedom with responsibility, that
too should be made clear. On
their (trivate and collective re
solve depends the continuance of
those high and worthy standards
which the students of this Uni
versity have thus far maintained,
and the vindication of those goals
for which a University exists.

Having followed with interest
the dispute about your editorial
policy, I was glad to read an edi
torial in today’s Daily (May 8,
1961) stating one incontestable
premise: that the bombing of live
Sigma Nu library reveals a de
plorable rejection of social re
sponsibility by the perpetrators of
the “fraternity prank.”
That rejection is indeed deplor
able for two reasons: it discredits
the ethical standards of the per
sons involved, and it brings into
question the value of the disci
plines in higher education. There
have been in the course of this
term three incidents of similar
import. The first was the some
times tasteless debate upon your
actions; the second was the dis
missal of several student govern
ment officials for abuse of office;
the third was the bombing affair.
I am unable to come to any judg
ment upon the first, except that
in the published statements there
has been a great deal more heat
than light.

But the accessible evidence con
cerning the other two incidents is
more explicit and alarming. It
does not concern the community
at large that the personal stand
ards of some of its members are
of such a calibre that they allow
of perverting the offices entrust
ed to them or of wilfully destroy
ing property and jeopardizing the
welfare of others. That is regret
table; but it is in the last analysis
a matter for private reflection.
However, it does concern the Uni
versity community, it must con
cern that community, that the
very purpose for which it exists
has been brought so strongly into
question.

That purpose is to prepare stu
dents to assume the one unalter
able duty of an educated man—to
act with integrity; to cherish free
dom, but to honor responsibility.
One would surely be unfair and
inaccurate in assuming that the
attitudes shown in these two af
fairs represent the attitudes of
most Stanfordians. But it is clear
that those who wish to dissociate
themselves from such attitudes
must now come to an open reaf
firmation of purpose.

The members of the student
government dismissed for wrong
ful conduct were presumably rep
resentatives of the student body,
elected by that body. The previous
incidents mentioned in your edi
torial as being similar to the Sig
ma Nu bombing indicate that the
attitudes shown in that more re
cent affair are not limited to the
seven persons who perpetrated it.
If the Stanford students as a
whole disavow these attitudes,
that must now be made evident.
And. on the other hand, if they
wish to discard the principle of
freedom with responsibility, that
too should be made clear. On
their (trivate and collective re
solve depends the continuance of
those high and worthy standards
which the students of this Uni
versity have thus far maintained,
and the vindication of those goals
