We must applaud Professor
Shaw’s demand for more open
and vigorous political discussion
at Stanford and heed his warning
that our policy in Latin America
may be catastrophic for both Lat
in America and ourselves. How
ever, to the adjectives “open and
vigorous” I would add, under
lined, the key word “informed.”
The current debate is being car
ried on. both on the right and the
left, by people who showed no in
terest in Cuba until the island
blew up. I would hesitate for pro
fesional reasons about expressing
vehement opinions and certainly
writing books concerning the cri
sis in Africa, India or some other
area of the world concerning
which I have no competence. This
of course does not imply a lack
of interest.

The staff of the Hispanic Amer
ican Report has been following
Cuban affairs month by month,
indeed day by day, for fourteen
years, and we analyzed exactly
the mistakes which were being
made and the consequences. Any
mild satisfaction we feel at the
flood of “you told us so” mes
sages we are now receiving is
more than offset by the tragic
feeling which must have over
whelmed Cassandra, a figure
whom I really understand for the
first time.

We have developed in our In
stitute techniques which are prov
ing their worth, but to become an
expert requires an immense
amount of time, devotion and
training. This country is plagued
with experts whose outdated ex
pertise is fed only by one or two
U.S. newspapers, an occasional
article, a rare visit to Latin Amer

ica, and little else. The task of
analyzing Latin American affairs
is just as complicated as surgery,
and most of our experts impress
mo the way a surgeon must feel
on visiting a provincial medical
school in Ruritania. A complete
reform of our academic system is
necessary if we are to produce
trained analysts in international
affairs. This is a long and rather
hopeless task in view of the rigor
mortis which has beset our aca
demic structure, but meanwhile
our universities are in large
measure responsible for the peo
ple who are running our foreign
policy in Washington, many of
whom are technically incredible.
What bothers me is that our
motto seems to be “millions for
defence but not one cent for
study.” We must spend unlimited
sums to get a man in orbit, pour
half a billion dollars into Latin
American aid, send technicians at
great expense all over the globe,
but it is considered out of the
question to give adequate support
to universities for work which
does not fit into our traditional
academic structure. The problem
is that such work requires some
thing other than money, and I
doubt very much if our universi
ties have it. If they don't, God
help us.

more than offset by the tragic
feeling which must have over
whelmed Cassandra, a figure
whom I really understand for the
first time.

We have developed in our In
stitute techniques which are prov
ing their worth, but to become an
expert requires an immense
amount of time, devotion and
training. This country is plagued
with experts whose outdated ex
pertise is fed only by one or two
U.S. newspapers, an occasional
article, a rare visit to Latin Amer

ica, and little else. The task of
analyzing Latin American affairs
is just as complicated as surgery,
and most of our experts impress
mo the way a surgeon must feel
on visiting a provincial medical
school in Ruritania. A complete
reform of our academic system is
necessary if we are to produce
trained analysts in international
affairs. This is a long and rather
hopeless task in view of the rigor
mortis which has beset our aca
demic structure, but meanwhile
our universities are in large
measure responsible for the peo
ple who are running our foreign
policy in Washington, many of
whom are technically incredible.
What bothers me is that our
motto seems to be “millions for
defence but not one cent for
study.” We must spend unlimited
sums to get a man in orbit, pour
half a billion dollars into Latin
American aid, send technicians at
great expense all over the globe,
but it is considered out of the
question to give adequate support
to universities for work which
does not fit into our traditional
academic structure. The problem
is that such work requires some
thing other than money, and I
doubt very much if our universi
ties have it. If they don't, God
help us.

We must applaud Professor
Shaw’s demand for more open
and vigorous political discussion
at Stanford and heed his warning
that our policy in Latin America
may be catastrophic for both Lat
in America and ourselves. How
ever, to the adjectives “open and
vigorous” I would add, under
lined, the key word “informed.”
The current debate is being car
ried on. both on the right and the
left, by people who showed no in
terest in Cuba until the island
blew up. I would hesitate for pro
fesional reasons about expressing
vehement opinions and certainly
writing books concerning the cri
sis in Africa, India or some other
area of the world concerning
which I have no competence. This
of course does not imply a lack
of interest.

The staff of the Hispanic Amer
ican Report has been following
Cuban affairs month by month,
indeed day by day, for fourteen
years, and we analyzed exactly
the mistakes which were being
made and the consequences. Any
mild satisfaction we feel at the
flood of “you told us so” mes
sages we are now receiving is
more than offset by the tragic
feeling which must have over
whelmed Cassandra, a figure
whom I really understand for the
