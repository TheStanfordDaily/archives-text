# Con Home Thanks
## 
### 
Since we can’t thank each of
you individually, we would like to
use this means to express our
gratitude to those freshman men
and women who went out into
Palo Alto and Menlo Park last
week to solicit for the Convales
cent Home. Many of you were
pulled away from midterm prepa
ration. Others, especially some of
the ‘‘male couples,” were disap
pointed in your partners. And
unfortunately some of you were
sent to areas which were too big
or which appeared to need the
money more than the Con Home
itself. Despite these drawbacks
and the fact that your class is
smaller than last year’s, you ac
cepted the challenge and support
ed the drive to the extent that it
is clearly the most successful to
date. The goal of $7,000 has been
surpassed and exceeds by over
$5OO the amount raised last year.
So to those of you who were a
part of this success, on behalf of
Cardinals Board, the Con Home
Week Committee, and those kids
who will benefit so greatly from
your efforts, many thanks again
for a job well done.
