## Indo-China Prospects Bleak; Reds Ignore US Policy, Peril S. Vietnam 
### 
Even with a cease fire in Laos,
our prospects in Indo-China are
bleak. The best we can hope for
now is that Prince Souvanna
Phouma, whose fall we engi
neered, will return to power, pre
siding over a quasi-neutralist gov
ernment. This government will
be more heavily mortgaged to the
Communists than was his first
government. In Laos, the State
Department gambled and lost on
the policy that a pro-American
government based on the Ameri
can military presence could be
pushed right up against Commu
nist China and Communist Viet
minh.

mam, which ad
joins Laos, the
government
which we
brought into
power and which
wo support, is in
great peril. It
still holds the ci
ties but it has all
but lost control

LIPPMANN 'of the country
side to the Communist guerrillas.
Why is our friend And client, Ngo
Dinh Diem, losing this civil war?
NOW the truth is, as so many
correspondents have reported,
that our man is extremely unpop
ular, his government being both
reactionary and corrupt. It fol
lows that if we are going to build
up a resistance to the Commu
nists, we cannot do it by dropping
in our paratroopers and expecting
them to win a guerrilla war. We
shall have first of all to reform
drastically the Vietnamese gov
ernment which we support. For
unless we can support a popular
government, we are certain to
lose in Vietnam.

This country has never yet had
a leader who has dared to explain
candidly the consequences of the
change in the world balance of
power since the Soviet Union
broke the American nuclear mo

nopoly in 1949. Until about the
middle ’fifties, until the Soviet
Union began to develop missiles
to carry nuclear weapons, our
military pre-eminence was still so
great that we were able with im
punity to encircle the Soviet
Union with military bases extend
ing from Japan and South Korea
through Southeast and South Asia
to the Middle East.
WHEN the Soviet Union became
a nuclear power, when our su
premacy was reduced to parity,
the wiser men of the West, those
with long memories and long ex
perience and long heads, realized
that military outposts could not
be maintained on the frontiers of
the Communist world. Just as
Cuba is not now, and will never
be allowed to become, a Soviet
military outpost, so in reverse for
peripheral positions like Laos,
The change in the world bal
ance of power demanded a change
in our policy. It demanded that
we scrap the policy of American
satellite states and promote in
stead a policy of neutralism for
the weak and vulnerable periph
eral states. That is the best, in
deed that is the only, hope of their
not being engulfed by commu
nism. In some measure, the Ken
nedy administration has recog
nized this truth for example in
accepting the idea of neutral
Laos. But the President has never
explained it to the country, and
therefore he has no reliable pub
lic opinion on which to lean.
UNTIL the country understands
that the basic conception of our
policy has to be changed, Mr. Ken
nedy will be a harried man. He
will have a series of crises in
which he has to be on the defen
sive and always trying to see how
little he can lose. Moreover, the
energies of the country and his
energies will be dispersed, and the
attention of the country and his
attention will be distracted from
the great tasks.
In Asia the great task is to con
solidate the key countries which
are India. Pakistan, and Japan.
In Latin America the future
will be determined in the key
countries- not in Cuba but in Bra
zil, the Argentine, Chile, Venezu
ela, and Mexico.
In the Middle East the future
depends not on the northern mili
tary alliance, which is mere pa
per, but on the capacity of the
key countries Egypt, Irag, Tur
key, and Iran—to adapt their poli
cies to the realities of the strate
gic position.
THE whole future, whether it is
to be war or peace, depends on
the consolidation of the Atlantic
Alliance, and upon the rise within

it of new, fresh, modern military
and political leadership.
There is a lot to be done and
the fate of mankind does not de
pend upon what happened in the
Bay of Pigs. It would be a good
thing if this could be realized by
those whom H. G. Wells once de
scribed as the “Gawdsakers,” that
is to say, those who are running
about and wringing their hands
over the Cuban mess and crying,
“For Gawd’s sake, let’s do some
thing,” They need to cool off.
They might ponder the wisest re
mark which was uttered during
the debates about Cuba—that Cas
tro i« a thorn in our flesh, but he
is not a dagger in our hearts.
Having gotten things in perspec
time again, the country could turn
its attention to those regions of
the globe where great and inspir
ing things are waiting to be done.
