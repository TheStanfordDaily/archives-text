### JOHN OSMUNDSON 
A Fast Start
At the start of every major league baseball season some player
gets away to a fast start and causes the fans to wonder if after all
these years this might be his year.
WALLY MOON has gotten off to just such a start this season
by hitting eight home runs in his first 12 games, nine in his first
23 starts, batting in 20 runs, holding a .500 hatting average through
most of the fir st part of the campaign and providing the Los Angeles |
Dodgers with the major part of their offensive power-.
At his current rate Moon should end up with something like
63.78 home runs call it 64 for practical purposes and would set a
new record in the process.
The old record, of course, belongs to Babe Ruth—6o home runs)
in one season set hack irr 1927 when Babe was playing right field
for the New York Yankees. There have been other sporting per
formances that have been outstanding, notably Bobby Jones’ grand
slam as an amateur golfer, but none has been quite as treasured as |
Ruth’s.
THE BABL’S has almost been broken on three occasions. Lew j
(Hack) Wilson hit 56 for the Chicago Cubs in 1930, the Philadelphia]
Athletics’ Jimmy Foxx slugged 58 round trippers in ’32 and Hank
Greenberg equaled Foxx’s output in 1938 for the Detroit Tigers.
Ralph Kiner, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays are some of the
stars in the modern era who have come the closest to duplicating
the homer record.
Records are meant to he broken and eventually Ruth’s will fall; !
we just don’t hope Moon isn’t the one to do it. Actually we’re not
too worried. Moon will probably taper off to his normal hitting and
run producing levels, but still his case holds special inteiest.
-MOON plays half of his games in ’6l in the Dodgers’ home park, j
the Los Angeles Coliseum and he gets a big advantage from the,
250-foot left field screen. A left handed batter, Wally has developed {
a delayed swing in order to hit with power to his opposite field,
down the left field line.
So far the swing has done wonders. Of his nine homers, eight
have been in the Coliseum all to left and left center. His output
fell on the road; only one of his homers has been hit in an enemy
park that one down the right field line—but he’ll see quite a bit I
more of the left field screen before the season is over.
Which brings up th question:. If Moon does succeed in hitting]
63.78 home runs beg pardon, 64 home runs will his feat be better j
than Ruth hitting 60 under more adverse conditions?
We say no.
BASEBALL is the national game and much of its popularity stems ]
from the fact that its traditions have been preserved over more than
70 years by leaving the basic rules unchanged and by keeping the j
whole character of the game intact.
A Gimmick
If Moon were to break Ruth's record he would be taking advan-1
tage of a temporary gimmick for he has never threatened the home 1
tun record, and probably never will again, once the Dodgers move]
to their new Chavez Ravine grounds.
Baseball can’t afford to cheapen its game, A new record by j
Moon woudl be no more worthy of recognition than a new 100-yard
dash mark set over a 90-yard course.
EVEN IF it means revamping a few of the older parks, baseball -
men might do well to require at least minimum foul line distances |
and field dimensions.
