for a double-header on Saturday.

CALIFORNIA, should it sweep
against (lie Trojans on Saturday,

still has three more games to
play next week, including a pair
against dangerous UCLA, and
would still have a mathematical
chance to win the crown.
Three other league games on
this weekend’s schedule include
Santa Clara at California on Fri
day and Santa Clara at Stanford

for a double-header on Saturday.
UCLA draws a league bye.
In the hitting department Lar
ry Himes, Southern California
catcher, remains atop the batting
averages of the CIBA, but Kevin
Scarpelli, California’s smooth out
fielder, is closing in.
Himes is batting .425, with
three more league games ahead.

SCARPELLI is at .415 with six
more league contest on tap.
The two swingers met head
and-head at Berkeley this Satur
day in what should really be an
interesting duel.
Art Ersepke, Troy outfielder
who was CIBA batting king a
year ago, ranks third in the aver
ages at ,385, but is not playing
regularly. Rod Dedeaux, SC men
tor, has been platooning his out
fielders with considerable success
in the latter stages of the league
race and will probably continue
to follow this practice.

TKBBIK FOVVI.EK, UCLA out
fielder, ranks fourth at .340 and
has bated in 15 runs, which ties
him in this category with Steve
Bach, Trojan second baseman.
Skip Lawrence, Bob Overman
and John Hurlbut of Stanford
are all in the top ten carrying
averages of .314, .304 and .303
respectively.
