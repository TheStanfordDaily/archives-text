# NEW FLAG FOR STANFORD’S POST OFFICE
## 
### 
The Stanford Post Office now flies a 50-star flag, thanks to
the prodding of Edwin M. Good, assistant professor of re
ligion, and a gift from the Palo Alto Republican Assembly.
Good recently wrote a letter to the editor of the Daily in
which he noted that the flag at the Post Office had only 48
stars. Members of the assembly investigated and Congress
man Charles S. Cubser (R-CilroyI obtained a flag which had
flown over the national Capitol. Presentation was made in
a ceremony yesterday. In the picture, Henry Quinn, super
