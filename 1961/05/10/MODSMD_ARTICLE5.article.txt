# Chaparral's Playboy Takeoff Spicy, Bold
## 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE 
Striving for greater heights of
audacity, the little men of the
Chaparral have managed to have
pr inted the raciest piece pf Farm
journalism in years with their
satire of Playboy Magazine, reti
tled ‘‘Dayboy.”

The ballyhooed “voluntary cen
sorship” proclaimed by new Old
Boy Brad Efron after conferences
with the dean isn’t all that ob
vious. The cover promises “vica
rious thrills for young dilet
tantes,” and there are plenty of
those. Plenty for Grannie when
you mail a copy home, too.

THE CHAPPIES have done
their versions of Playboy’s stand
ard features - “Layboy After
Ours,” “Layboy Advisor,” etc.—
but the one that conies off best
(even after censorship) is the
Chappie’s answer to the Play
mate. Any Stanford rough should
be able to guess what she’s
renamed.
The feature articles are laid out
(no pun intended) in a similar
manner to the original mag’s, and
are all preoccupied with the same
thing—sex. They’re “Stanford
i/ed,” however and this aspect of
the preoccupation make some of
them a howl. It also makes some
redundant bores.

“SILVERSTEIN Among the
Zetes,” is just W'hat it sounds like,
and is the mag’s funniest piece,

and typical of the topical, local
ized humor the Chappie does best
and should stick to. Judy Skin
ner’s "Fable of the Farm—ll” is
sly and subtle, a unique approach
for "Layboy.”
AN INCONGRUOUS feature is
a "portfolioette of the best queens
from the Stanford Chaparral.” A
big change from earlier Chappies
this year when Stanford babes
were only useful as a hilarious
contrast to those magnificent San
Jose specimens. Does ol’ Elly de
tect an attempt to sell more cop
ies among Farm coeds rather than
alienating them further?—or an
appeal for dates for the little
men?

Tying in with this hypothesis
is Old Boy Efron's statement that
"Layboy” is the biggest Chappie
ever produced and that the press
run is greater than ever, just to
show what a hot little number
they think they have on their
hands.

It may prove to be forty cents is
the going rate the first time
around, and sales ate set for Quad
and the P.O.

“LAYBOY” is a good satire if
you like Playboy in the first place.
Blue humor is pushed to the
questionable point and the inci
sive strokes with w'hich satire can
be most funny are missing, but
the Chaparral has put out a mag
guaranteed to appeal to the tastes
of the average Stanford male and
earthy Stanford females.
