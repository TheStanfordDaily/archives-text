# He Entered Stanford 40 Years Ago...
## 
### LOIS ROOT 
There’s a history book of Stan
ford walking around on campus
in the form of Manuel G. Betten
court, employee of the University
for 40 consecutive years. Since
1921 he lias watched and helped
Stanford grow.
The campus has changed quite
a lot in those 40 years, according
to Bettencourt. Coming from a
carpenter’s shop on Tereeira Is
land in the Azores, lie sought em
ployment at Stanford and became
a farm hand, milking cows in the
Stanford barn, now known as the
Stanford winery.
In the 1920’s the University area
really was a farm; “You couldn’t
look out of a window without see
ing the fields of hay. corn and
wheat,’’ Bettencourt recalls. And
during his first few summers
here, he worked in those fields.
AFTKK A few years, he sought
the outdoors and joined the labor
force to dig ditches and do car
pentry work. During this time, he
and other men were asked to go
to Searsville Lake in 1924 to con
nect the domestic water pipes to
the Searsville pipes because a wa
ter hook-up was .needed in this
area during the drought in case

“We also helped to put out fires.
When the old whistle blew we
would run to jump onto the Mod
el-T trucks. Tires weren’t made
then as they are now; the driver
would steer the truck onto a field
and we were lucky if the tires
didn’t blow out on the rocks,” re
calls Bettencourt.
ALREADY a Jack • of - many -
trades, he added two Model-T
Fords and three “private” cows to
his work load, one belonging to
his foreman, another to Stanford
Controller Aldon E. Roth, and one
for the campus sheriff, Fred
Freed.
He was spared taking care of
the four teams of horses then
used by the Corp Yard to deliver
goods all over campus.
Despite the large number of
tasks he had to do. he managed
to schedule in some extra time;
so one day in 1934 he ambled over
to the Stanford Nursery, then lo
cated behind the Museum, to see
if he could help out. At that time
the new women’s dormitory, La
gunita, needed landscaping and
flowers for the new flower boxes.
BETTENCOURT so enjoyed
j working with the nursery that
after two years, he became a fidl
I lime gardener. One day in 1930

j he stood up from his work to give
President Hoover some advice on
I care for his garden,
j Bettencourt moved to Union
Court four years later to give the
gardens and window boxes there
the benefit of his care.
When he had eight years of gar
dening behind him, he was ready
I for another change. He joined Iho
truck drivers at the Corp Yard to
help with on-campus delivery.
Bettencourt remembers that these
early 40’s saw the beginnings of
a resident, as well as classroom,
j campus; fields were forced to give
| way to buildings to house more
I students.
AND MOKE students led to an
increase in campus activity Bet
tencourt remembers Gordon Da
vis, precursor to Captain Mid
night and now police chief, speed
j ing by on his motorcycle in pur
suit of some vanishing student,
i Six years of delivering on cam
pus was enough for Bettencourt,
so in 1919 he returned to the nur
sery where he remained until 1957
j raising flowers from seedlings,
growing cuttings in wet sand, and
arranging cut flowers for Lagu
nita, Ventura Hall, the president’s
j house and weddings in Memorial
i Church.

Bettencourt liked Lagunita and
returned to gardening there; at
the -same time he cleaned out the
women's old swimming poo) lo
cated in the area of the Quad and
Chappie offices, which wore then
dressing roms.
THEN IN 1959, he crossed the
street from Lagunita for a full
day and has stayed at the Wom
en’s Gym ever since. His jobs
there have included maintaining
the now pool, watering and lining
the archery field, and keeping the
gophers out of the field, with the
help of his terrier Candy.
Bettencourt now lives in Moun
tain View with his wife and is
manager of the Portuguese Coun
try Club there. He is quite active
in social clubs and fraternal or
ganizations and in 1949 toured the
lodges of California as grand pres
ident of the California Portuguese
Lodge.
Mrs. Lucll Guthrie, head of the
Women’s Physical Education De
partment, sums up Bettencourt’s
employ: “Mr. Bettencourt is very
amiable, obliging and quite pleas
ant to get along with. He works
well with us, and that is worth
recognition in itself, for believe
me, it’s very hard for a man to
gel along well with 12 women!”

Mrs. Lucll Guthrie, head of the
Women’s Physical Education De

employ: “Mr. Bettencourt is very
amiable, obliging and quite pleas

me, it’s very hard for a man to

There’s a history book of Stan
ford walking around on campus
in the form of Manuel G. Betten
court, employee of the University
for 40 consecutive years. Since
1921 he lias watched and helped
Stanford grow.
The campus has changed quite
a lot in those 40 years, according
to Bettencourt. Coming from a
carpenter’s shop on Tereeira Is
land in the Azores, lie sought em
ployment at Stanford and became
a farm hand, milking cows in the
Stanford barn, now known as the
Stanford winery.
In the 1920’s the University area
really was a farm; “You couldn’t
look out of a window without see
ing the fields of hay. corn and
wheat,’’ Bettencourt recalls. And
during his first few summers
here, he worked in those fields.
AFTKK A few years, he sought
the outdoors and joined the labor
force to dig ditches and do car
pentry work. During this time, he
and other men were asked to go
to Searsville Lake in 1924 to con
nect the domestic water pipes to
the Searsville pipes because a wa
ter hook-up was .needed in this
area during the drought in case

“We also helped to put out fires.
When the old whistle blew we
would run to jump onto the Mod
el-T trucks. Tires weren’t made
then as they are now; the driver
would steer the truck onto a field
and we were lucky if the tires

MANUEL G. BETTENCOURT
With pet terrier, Candy
There’s a history book of Stan
ford walking around on campus
in the form of Manuel G. Betten
court, employee of the University
for 40 consecutive years. Since
1921 he lias watched and helped
Stanford grow.
The campus has changed quite
a lot in those 40 years, according
to Bettencourt. Coming from a
carpenter’s shop on Tereeira Is
land in the Azores, lie sought em
ployment at Stanford and became
a farm hand, milking cows in the
Stanford barn, now known as the
Stanford winery.
In the 1920’s the University area
really was a farm; “You couldn’t
look out of a window without see
ing the fields of hay. corn and
wheat,’’ Bettencourt recalls. And
during his first few summers
here, he worked in those fields.
AFTKK A few years, he sought
the outdoors and joined the labor
force to dig ditches and do car
pentry work. During this time, he
and other men were asked to go
to Searsville Lake in 1924 to con
nect the domestic water pipes to
the Searsville pipes because a wa
ter hook-up was .needed in this
area during the drought in case

“We also helped to put out fires.
When the old whistle blew we
would run to jump onto the Mod
el-T trucks. Tires weren’t made
then as they are now; the driver
would steer the truck onto a field
and we were lucky if the tires
didn’t blow out on the rocks,” re
calls Bettencourt.
ALREADY a Jack • of - many -
trades, he added two Model-T
Fords and three “private” cows to
his work load, one belonging to
his foreman, another to Stanford
Controller Aldon E. Roth, and one
for the campus sheriff, Fred
Freed.
He was spared taking care of
the four teams of horses then
used by the Corp Yard to deliver
goods all over campus.
Despite the large number of
tasks he had to do. he managed
to schedule in some extra time;
so one day in 1934 he ambled over
to the Stanford Nursery, then lo
cated behind the Museum, to see
if he could help out. At that time
the new women’s dormitory, La
gunita, needed landscaping and
flowers for the new flower boxes.
BETTENCOURT so enjoyed
j working with the nursery that
after two years, he became a fidl
I lime gardener. One day in 1930

j he stood up from his work to give
President Hoover some advice on
I care for his garden,
j Bettencourt moved to Union
Court four years later to give the
gardens and window boxes there
the benefit of his care.

dening behind him, he was ready
