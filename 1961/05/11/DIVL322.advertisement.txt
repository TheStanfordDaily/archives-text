Terrific buy at the Big E:
100% FINE ALPACA
7-BUTTON CARDIGAN
The "Gene littler"

Finding an alpaca sweater at a price like this
is like finding money. It's yours for all-out
good looks in a dashing all-over rib knit with
low-set pockets... and of course, the highly
popular 7-button front. Self trim. Hand wash
able. Olive, charcoal, dark brown. S-M-L-XL.
