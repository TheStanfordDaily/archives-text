## 
### FRANCES FISHER 
"Cheaters are making suckers of us all," Law Prof. Emeritus Harry
J. Rathbun pointed out last night in a discussion concerning the chal
lenge that the Fundamental Standard presents to the individual.
In addition to Rathbun, Dean of Students Donald Winbigler, Men's
Council member Eric Blitz and former Fundamental Standard Com
mission Chairman Bob Linneman spoke on the problem.

Directing his remarks to a
sparse audience at the Physics
Lecture Hall. Rathbun compared
the situations of seeing a burglar
and seeing •someone cheating. “If
I see a burglar stealing something
of value from me, I call the police.
Similarly when I see someone
cheating I should take some ac
tion, since this person is decreas
ing the value of my degree by
his action.”
In defining 3rd Person Respon
sibility. Rathbun said that the
word “responsibility” should be
divided into two words ability to
respond. “The ability to respond
to a situation creatively, accord
ing to the needs of the particular
problem, is the real measure of a
leader,” Rathbun said.
“WISDOM," he continued, is
| not only knowing what to do. but
j doing it.”
Dean of Students Donald Win
bigler spoke next on tho value
| which the University places on
student responsibility,
j Cryptically, Winbigler pointed
I out that the University places a
high value on student responsibil
ity because it “is the most effec
tive.” Working through the stu
dents is the most effective way of
! keeping levels of honesty high.
WINBIGLER hastened to em
phasize. however, the important
educational value of placing re
sponsibility on the students. “Hon
esty and integrity are not natural,
he stated, “but to be educated and
civilized is to realize that the in
terests of the whole group serve
the interests of the individual.”
He illustrated how much our
society depends on honesty by cit
ing everyday examples of a per
son’s complete dependence upon
the honesty of someone else. “For
instance, you must depend on the
druggist to give you the drugs on
your prescription, rather than a
cheaper substitute, and you must
! assume that an attorney will ad
vise you to the best of his ability
—that he won't cheat you.”
Concluding his talk, Winbigler
expressed the hope that Stanford
students will not weaken their at
tempts to preserve the hard-won
rights of the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standord.
ERIC REIT/, former chairman
of Men’s Council, emphasized the
I constructive, rather than punitive
| purposes of Men’s Council. He
used this principle as support for
the policy of not publicizing cases
tried by the council.
Explaining the little • known
rights of the individual during a
trial, Blitz enumerated three
rights of an accused person dur
ing the investigatory stage of the
case: 1) he could appeal to the
Dean of Students, 2» he could dis
qualify any member of the Judi
cial Council from participating in
the investigation, and 3) he could
bring in witnesses to support his
testimony.
As the concluding speaker, Bob
Linneman, former chairman of
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission, review
ed the last school year from the
standpoint of the Commission’s
initial purpose and the conclu
sions it has drawn.
“LAST FALL we decided to
evaluate the system of the Funda
mental Standard and come to a
conclusion as to whether or not
the system works.”
“After this evaluation,” Linne
man stated, “I have decided that
the general attitude of the stu
dents is that the whole system is
a farce.” He felt that the sparse
turn-out to the discussion sup
ported this conclusion.
LINNEMAN pin-pointed the
source of the problem as being
the fact that the Commission has
not done its job of educating and
orienting the students to the
ideals of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
“Two challenges now exist,”
I Linneman said. “One. do wo want
j the system? and two, if we want
J it can we prove it by accepting
i the responsibility that must go
I along with it ?”

As the concluding speaker, Bob
Linneman, former chairman of
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission, review
ed the last school year from the
standpoint of the Commission’s
initial purpose and the conclu
sions it has drawn.
“LAST FALL we decided to
evaluate the system of the Funda
mental Standard and come to a
conclusion as to whether or not
the system works.”
“After this evaluation,” Linne
man stated, “I have decided that
the general attitude of the stu
dents is that the whole system is
a farce.” He felt that the sparse
turn-out to the discussion sup
ported this conclusion.
LINNEMAN pin-pointed the
source of the problem as being
the fact that the Commission has
not done its job of educating and
orienting the students to the
ideals of the Fundamental Stand
ard.

"Cheaters are making suckers of us all," Law Prof. Emeritus Harry
J. Rathbun pointed out last night in a discussion concerning the chal
lenge that the Fundamental Standard presents to the individual.
In addition to Rathbun, Dean of Students Donald Winbigler, Men's
Council member Eric Blitz and former Fundamental Standard Com
mission Chairman Bob Linneman spoke on the problem.

Directing his remarks to a
sparse audience at the Physics
Lecture Hall. Rathbun compared
the situations of seeing a burglar
and seeing •someone cheating. “If
I see a burglar stealing something
of value from me, I call the police.
Similarly when I see someone
cheating I should take some ac
tion, since this person is decreas
ing the value of my degree by
his action.”
In defining 3rd Person Respon
sibility. Rathbun said that the
word “responsibility” should be
divided into two words ability to
respond. “The ability to respond
to a situation creatively, accord
ing to the needs of the particular
problem, is the real measure of a
leader,” Rathbun said.
“WISDOM," he continued, is
| not only knowing what to do. but
j doing it.”
Dean of Students Donald Win
bigler spoke next on tho value
| which the University places on
student responsibility,
j Cryptically, Winbigler pointed
I out that the University places a
high value on student responsibil
ity because it “is the most effec
tive.” Working through the stu
dents is the most effective way of
! keeping levels of honesty high.
WINBIGLER hastened to em
phasize. however, the important
educational value of placing re
sponsibility on the students. “Hon
esty and integrity are not natural,
he stated, “but to be educated and
civilized is to realize that the in
terests of the whole group serve
the interests of the individual.”
He illustrated how much our
society depends on honesty by cit
ing everyday examples of a per
son’s complete dependence upon
the honesty of someone else. “For
instance, you must depend on the
druggist to give you the drugs on
your prescription, rather than a
cheaper substitute, and you must
! assume that an attorney will ad
vise you to the best of his ability
—that he won't cheat you.”
Concluding his talk, Winbigler
expressed the hope that Stanford
students will not weaken their at
tempts to preserve the hard-won
rights of the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standord.
ERIC REIT/, former chairman
of Men’s Council, emphasized the
I constructive, rather than punitive

Explaining the little • known
rights of the individual during a
trial, Blitz enumerated three
rights of an accused person dur
ing the investigatory stage of the
case: 1) he could appeal to the

society depends on honesty by cit
ing everyday examples of a per
son’s complete dependence upon
the honesty of someone else. “For
instance, you must depend on the
druggist to give you the drugs on
your prescription, rather than a
cheaper substitute, and you must
! assume that an attorney will ad
vise you to the best of his ability
—that he won't cheat you.”
Concluding his talk, Winbigler
expressed the hope that Stanford
students will not weaken their at
tempts to preserve the hard-won
rights of the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standord.
ERIC REIT/, former chairman
of Men’s Council, emphasized the
I constructive, rather than punitive
| purposes of Men’s Council. He
used this principle as support for
the policy of not publicizing cases
tried by the council.
Explaining the little • known
rights of the individual during a
trial, Blitz enumerated three
rights of an accused person dur
ing the investigatory stage of the
case: 1) he could appeal to the
Dean of Students, 2» he could dis
qualify any member of the Judi
cial Council from participating in
the investigation, and 3) he could
bring in witnesses to support his
testimony.
As the concluding speaker, Bob
Linneman, former chairman of
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission, review
ed the last school year from the
standpoint of the Commission’s
initial purpose and the conclu
sions it has drawn.
“LAST FALL we decided to
evaluate the system of the Funda
mental Standard and come to a
conclusion as to whether or not
the system works.”
“After this evaluation,” Linne
man stated, “I have decided that
the general attitude of the stu
dents is that the whole system is
a farce.” He felt that the sparse
turn-out to the discussion sup
ported this conclusion.
LINNEMAN pin-pointed the
source of the problem as being
the fact that the Commission has
not done its job of educating and
orienting the students to the
ideals of the Fundamental Stand
ard.
“Two challenges now exist,”
I Linneman said. “One. do wo want
j the system? and two, if we want
J it can we prove it by accepting
i the responsibility that must go
I along with it ?”
