# Secretary Udall Violated Trust
## 
### 
A few weeks ago President Kennedy in his conflict-of-interests
speech to Congress said that "all officials must act with unwavering
integrity, absolute impartiality and complete devotion to the public
interest. This principle must be followed not only in reality but in
appearance. For the basis of effective government is public confi
dence, and that confidence is endangered when ethical standards
falter or appear to falter."
Somewhat sadly, a few days after the President's statement an
affair in his own official family took place, or at least became public
knowledge. The Secretary of the Interior Stuart Udall was exposed
as having sent a letter to Mr. J. K. Evans, a friend in the gas and oil
industry, requesting him to solicit the oil and gas industry for tickets
to a $lOO a plate, $l,OOO a table birthday party for President Ken
nedy. Mr. Udall, of course, denies such intent. All he hoped was that
Mr. Evans and "some of his friends would be at the dinner." Mr.
Udall, at a press conference, described himself as "flabbergasted"
and "embarrassed" by the letter. While he should be embarrassed,
it seems to us that he should not be too flabbergasted. Unless, of
course, we assume that Mr. Evans would send a letter to fifty-six
executives and lobbyists of the oil and gas industry, asking them to
the dinner, stating that it was Mr. Udall's idea, sending a carbon
copy to Mr. Udall, but without Mr. Udall's knowledge.
Even if we swallow this explanation of Mr. Udall's, and it is a
pretty large mouthful, his actions have shaken our trust in the Ken
nedy administration. The Interior Department has jurisdiction over
important functions of the petroleum industry. It is a rich industry
which can mobilize a powerful political lobbying force. In such a
position the Secretary should demonstrate his independence of this
pressure whether it comes from "a few friends" or a long list of
lobbyists.
Republicans and Democrats alike have been caught in similar
affairs. Perhaps as the New York Times points out, Mr. Udall "is a
victim of the questionable way in which political party functions are
financed."
While this may be true, Mr. Udall has certainly erred. In the fu
ture he should show a sincere respect for the high office he holds
and the public trust it represents. It would be unfortunate if a cabinet
member could not adhere to the ethics the President has pronounced.

financed."
While this may be true, Mr. Udall has certainly erred. In the fu
ture he should show a sincere respect for the high office he holds
and the public trust it represents. It would be unfortunate if a cabinet
member could not adhere to the ethics the President has pronounced.
A few weeks ago President Kennedy in his conflict-of-interests
speech to Congress said that "all officials must act with unwavering
integrity, absolute impartiality and complete devotion to the public
interest. This principle must be followed not only in reality but in
appearance. For the basis of effective government is public confi
dence, and that confidence is endangered when ethical standards
falter or appear to falter."
Somewhat sadly, a few days after the President's statement an
affair in his own official family took place, or at least became public
knowledge. The Secretary of the Interior Stuart Udall was exposed
as having sent a letter to Mr. J. K. Evans, a friend in the gas and oil
industry, requesting him to solicit the oil and gas industry for tickets
to a $lOO a plate, $l,OOO a table birthday party for President Ken
nedy. Mr. Udall, of course, denies such intent. All he hoped was that
Mr. Evans and "some of his friends would be at the dinner." Mr.
Udall, at a press conference, described himself as "flabbergasted"
and "embarrassed" by the letter. While he should be embarrassed,
it seems to us that he should not be too flabbergasted. Unless, of
course, we assume that Mr. Evans would send a letter to fifty-six
executives and lobbyists of the oil and gas industry, asking them to
the dinner, stating that it was Mr. Udall's idea, sending a carbon
copy to Mr. Udall, but without Mr. Udall's knowledge.
Even if we swallow this explanation of Mr. Udall's, and it is a
pretty large mouthful, his actions have shaken our trust in the Ken
nedy administration. The Interior Department has jurisdiction over
important functions of the petroleum industry. It is a rich industry
which can mobilize a powerful political lobbying force. In such a
position the Secretary should demonstrate his independence of this
pressure whether it comes from "a few friends" or a long list of
lobbyists.
Republicans and Democrats alike have been caught in similar
affairs. Perhaps as the New York Times points out, Mr. Udall "is a
victim of the questionable way in which political party functions are
financed."
