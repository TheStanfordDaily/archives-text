## Progressive Society Answer to Communism 
### 
We have been forced to ask our
selves recently how a free and
open society can compete with a
totalitarian state. This is a cru
cial question. Can our Western
society survive and flourish if it
remains true to its own faith and
principles? Or must it abandon
them in order to fight fire with
fire?

tell you that while he intends to
do what he can to assist the in
evitable, knowing that we will do
what we can to oppose the inevita
ble, what he does and what we do
will not be decisive. Destiny will
be realized no matter what men
do.

The dogma of inevitability not
only gives him the self-assurance
of a man who has no doubts but
is a most powerful ingredient of
the Communist propaganda. What
do we say to him, we who believe
in a certain freedom of the human
will and in the capacity of men
to affect the course of history by
their discoveries, their wisdom,
and their courage?
WE CAN say that in Mr. K.’s
dogma there is an unexamined
premise. It is that the capitalist
society is static, that it is and al
ways will be what it was when
Marx described it a hundred years
ago, that—to use Mr. K.’s own
lingo—there is no difference be
tween Rockefeller and his grand
father. Because a capitalist soci
ety cannot change, in its dealings
with the under-developed coun
tries it can only dominate and ex
ploit. It cannot emancipate and
help. If it could emancipate and
help, the inevitability of commu
nism would evaporate.
I venture to argue from this
analysis that the reason we are
on the defensive in so many
places is that for some ten years
we have been doing exactly what
Mr. K. expects us to do. We have
used money and arms in a long
losing attempt to stabilize native
governments which, in the name
of anti-communism, are opposed
to all important social change.
This has been exactly what Mr.
K.’s dogma calls for—that com
munism should be the only alter
native to the status quo with its
immemorial poverty and privi
lege.
WE CANNOT compete with
communism in Asia, Africa, or
Latin America if we go on doing
what we have done so often and
so widely—which is to place the
weak countries in a dilemma
where they must stand still with
us and our client rulers, or start
moving with the Communists.
This dilemma canont be dissolved
unless it is our central and per
sistent and unswerving policy to
offer these unhappy countries a
third option, which is economic
development and social improve
ment without the totalitarian dis
cipline of communism.
For the only real alternative to
communism is a liberal and pro
gressive society.

| There are those
who believe that
in Cuba the at
tempt to fight
fire with fire
would have suc
ceeded if only
the Pres ide nt
[had been more
ruthless and had
’had no scruples
about using
American forces.

I think they are wrong. I think
that success for the Cuban adven
ture was impossible. In a free so
ciety like ours a policy is bound
to fall which deliberately violates
our pledges and our principles,
our treaties and our laws. It is
not possible for a free and open
society to organize successfully a
spectacular conspiracy.
THE UNITED STATES, like
every other government, must
employ secret agents. But the
United States cannot successfully
conduct large secret conspiracies.
It is impossible to keep them se
cret. It is impossible for every
body concerned, beginning with
the President himself, to be suffi
ciently ruthless and unscrupulous.
The American conscience is a re
ality. It will make hesitant and
ineffectual, even if it does not pre
vent, an un-American policy. The
ultimate reason why the Cuban
affair was incompetent is that it
was out of character, like a cow
that tried to fly or a fish that
tried to walk.
It follows that in the great
struggle with communism, we
must find our strength by devel
oping and applying our own prin
ciples, not in abandoning them.
Before anyone tells me that this
is sissy, I should like to say why
I believe it, especially after listen
ing carefully and at some lengths
to Mr. Khrushchev. I am very cer
tain that we shall have the an
swer to Mr. Khrushchev if, but
only if, we stop being fascinated
by the cloak and dagger business
and. being true to ourselves, take
our own principles seriously.
Mr. K. is a true believer that
communism is destined to sup

planted feudalism. For him this

We have been forced to ask our

The dogma of inevitability not

WE CAN say that in Mr. K.’s
dogma there is an unexamined
premise. It is that the capitalist
society is static, that it is and al
ways will be what it was when
Marx described it a hundred years
ago, that—to use Mr. K.’s own
lingo—there is no difference be
tween Rockefeller and his grand
father. Because a capitalist soci
ety cannot change, in its dealings
with the under-developed coun
tries it can only dominate and ex
ploit. It cannot emancipate and
help. If it could emancipate and
help, the inevitability of commu
nism would evaporate.
I venture to argue from this
analysis that the reason we are
on the defensive in so many
places is that for some ten years
we have been doing exactly what
Mr. K. expects us to do. We have
used money and arms in a long
losing attempt to stabilize native
governments which, in the name
of anti-communism, are opposed
to all important social change.
This has been exactly what Mr.
K.’s dogma calls for—that com
munism should be the only alter

immemorial poverty and privi
lege.
WE CANNOT compete with
communism in Asia, Africa, or
Latin America if we go on doing
what we have done so often and
so widely—which is to place the
weak countries in a dilemma
where they must stand still with
us and our client rulers, or start
moving with the Communists.
This dilemma canont be dissolved
unless it is our central and per
sistent and unswerving policy to
offer these unhappy countries a
third option, which is economic
development and social improve

cipline of communism.

WE CANNOT compete with
communism in Asia, Africa, or
Latin America if we go on doing
what we have done so often and
so widely—which is to place the
weak countries in a dilemma
where they must stand still with
us and our client rulers, or start
moving with the Communists.
This dilemma canont be dissolved
unless it is our central and per
sistent and unswerving policy to
offer these unhappy countries a
third option, which is economic
development and social improve

We have been forced to ask our
selves recently how a free and

totalitarian state. This is a cru

society survive and flourish if it
remains true to its own faith and
principles? Or must it abandon
them in order to fight fire with
fire?

do what he can to assist the in
evitable, knowing that we will do
what we can to oppose the inevita

will not be decisive. Destiny will
be realized no matter what men
do.

The dogma of inevitability not
only gives him the self-assurance
of a man who has no doubts but
is a most powerful ingredient of
the Communist propaganda. What
do we say to him, we who believe
in a certain freedom of the human
will and in the capacity of men
to affect the course of history by
their discoveries, their wisdom,
and their courage?
WE CAN say that in Mr. K.’s
dogma there is an unexamined
premise. It is that the capitalist
society is static, that it is and al
ways will be what it was when
Marx described it a hundred years
ago, that—to use Mr. K.’s own
lingo—there is no difference be
tween Rockefeller and his grand
father. Because a capitalist soci
ety cannot change, in its dealings
with the under-developed coun
tries it can only dominate and ex
ploit. It cannot emancipate and
help. If it could emancipate and
help, the inevitability of commu
nism would evaporate.
I venture to argue from this
analysis that the reason we are
on the defensive in so many
places is that for some ten years
we have been doing exactly what
Mr. K. expects us to do. We have
used money and arms in a long
losing attempt to stabilize native
governments which, in the name
of anti-communism, are opposed
to all important social change.
