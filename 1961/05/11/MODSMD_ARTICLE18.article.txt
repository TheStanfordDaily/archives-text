A lew Look Looms at Spring Drills

Sideline quarterbacks have been buzzing for quite some time now
about the “new look’’ at Stanford, so we. being of insatiable curi
osity, couldn’t help but wander out toward the practice field earlier
this week to see for ourselves. We got quite a shock. There midst
the blocking dummies and sleds we recognized only a few faces and
even they were not where we expected to find them.
In fact the only familiar sight was the short, stocky hulk of
Cactus Jack standing there with his arms crossed in front of him
and that bright red baseball cap resting on the badk of his head.
He watched intently as the first club ran through some patterns,
and here again we were surprised.

THE SQUAD was running out
of what Curtice calls “the spread
split-T.“ No longer was the quar
terback dropping straight back
and firing to the flanked halfback
as in previous years. Instead they
were running a lot of action
passes, i.e. roll outs, pass-run op
tions, etc.
“We’ve got a little more fi
nesse with two and sometimes
three men handling the ball back
there,” Curtice explained. This
does not mean that the Cards will
be concentrating more on the run
ning game, although admittedly
they will have more speed in the
backfield next September.
Then also in the way of sur
prises is the personnel, eighty per
cent of which is freshmen. The
first unit has been changed con
tinually through the practice ses
sions with only end Steve Pursell’s
face appearing again and again.

“WE’VE GOT a great bunch of kids and they’re all getting a
chance,” the peppery coach said as he pointed to a roster, “no one
of them is any higher than any other. We’ll have to wait till next
week sometime before we start thinking about teams for the alumni
game.”
Curtice went on to praise this crop as “the finest and most spir
ited bunch” he’s ever had at Stanford, but we’ve heard this said
before on the spring practice field. This year though, with 40 fresh
men out, there did seem to be a difference—a certain snap and spark
that hadn’t been evident in years past.
The Stanford coaching staff has been careful about singling out
any individual for praise since the workouts began, but their voices
can’t hide a slight tone of anxiety as they talk about freshman full
back Mike Barnes’ three touchdowns two weeks ago or the long
gainer ripped off hy shifty Tyce Fitzmorris in that same game. Then
there are the surprise performances of yearling Steve Thurlow and
sophomore Reg Rhodes at quarterback and the fine running of Danny
Spence, who played JV hall last year. These are all new faces on
the varsity practice field, but they are probably here to stay.
THEN TOO, there are a number of returning lettermen who will
undoubtedly carry the load next year despite the large freshman
turnout. Returning from the starting eleven of last year are Pursell.
end; Phil Toorvald, tackle; and Chris Cottle, center. Tom Walsh,
who played about equal time with Ron Fernandes at guard, will he
back too, making a total of three and one-half.

Curtice Faces Backfield Headache

Biggest loss, of course, for the Indians was the starting backfield,
and here is where the new faces will be most likely to appear. Rod
Sears seems to have the inside track on the quarterback slot, if for
no other reason than experience. Sears has played behind Norman
for two years now and should be ready to come into his own.
Jim Smith is another possibility here, but even his will be a new
face for some Stanford fans. Smith did not play last year although
he lettered in 1959 as a sophomore. He is currently pitching for
Coach Dutch Fehring’s cellar-bound baseball team.
THE REST of the backfield is anybody’s guess. Returning letter
men for these spots include Ed Cummings, Tim Hanzel, Larry Rovse,
Hal Steubei, Gaiy Craig and Stan Lindskog. Add to these the out
standing freshman already mentioned and such worthy Brave candi
dates as Spence and Mick Doherty and the result is a tough choice
—both to make and to predict.
At any rate it will he a new team, a new system, a now schedule
and we hope some new results. They have im place to go but up’.

Sears seems to have the inside track on the quarterback slot, if for
no other reason than experience. Sears has played behind Norman
for two years now and should be ready to come into his own.

Coach Dutch Fehring’s cellar-bound baseball team.

CACTUS JACK
That familiar red cap
A lew Look Looms at Spring Drills

Sideline quarterbacks have been buzzing for quite some time now
about the “new look’’ at Stanford, so we. being of insatiable curi
osity, couldn’t help but wander out toward the practice field earlier
this week to see for ourselves. We got quite a shock. There midst
the blocking dummies and sleds we recognized only a few faces and
even they were not where we expected to find them.
In fact the only familiar sight was the short, stocky hulk of
Cactus Jack standing there with his arms crossed in front of him
and that bright red baseball cap resting on the badk of his head.
He watched intently as the first club ran through some patterns,
and here again we were surprised.

THE SQUAD was running out
of what Curtice calls “the spread
split-T.“ No longer was the quar
terback dropping straight back
and firing to the flanked halfback
as in previous years. Instead they
were running a lot of action
passes, i.e. roll outs, pass-run op
tions, etc.
“We’ve got a little more fi
nesse with two and sometimes
three men handling the ball back
there,” Curtice explained. This
does not mean that the Cards will
be concentrating more on the run
ning game, although admittedly
they will have more speed in the
backfield next September.
Then also in the way of sur
prises is the personnel, eighty per
cent of which is freshmen. The
first unit has been changed con
tinually through the practice ses
sions with only end Steve Pursell’s
face appearing again and again.

“WE’VE GOT a great bunch of kids and they’re all getting a
chance,” the peppery coach said as he pointed to a roster, “no one
of them is any higher than any other. We’ll have to wait till next
week sometime before we start thinking about teams for the alumni
game.”
Curtice went on to praise this crop as “the finest and most spir
ited bunch” he’s ever had at Stanford, but we’ve heard this said
before on the spring practice field. This year though, with 40 fresh
men out, there did seem to be a difference—a certain snap and spark
that hadn’t been evident in years past.
The Stanford coaching staff has been careful about singling out
any individual for praise since the workouts began, but their voices
can’t hide a slight tone of anxiety as they talk about freshman full
back Mike Barnes’ three touchdowns two weeks ago or the long
gainer ripped off hy shifty Tyce Fitzmorris in that same game. Then

THE SQUAD was running out
of what Curtice calls “the spread
split-T.“ No longer was the quar
terback dropping straight back
and firing to the flanked halfback
as in previous years. Instead they
were running a lot of action
passes, i.e. roll outs, pass-run op
tions, etc.
“We’ve got a little more fi
nesse with two and sometimes
three men handling the ball back
there,” Curtice explained. This
does not mean that the Cards will
be concentrating more on the run
ning game, although admittedly
they will have more speed in the
backfield next September.
Then also in the way of sur
prises is the personnel, eighty per
cent of which is freshmen. The
first unit has been changed con
tinually through the practice ses
sions with only end Steve Pursell’s
face appearing again and again.

“WE’VE GOT a great bunch of kids and they’re all getting a
chance,” the peppery coach said as he pointed to a roster, “no one
of them is any higher than any other. We’ll have to wait till next
week sometime before we start thinking about teams for the alumni
game.”
Curtice went on to praise this crop as “the finest and most spir
ited bunch” he’s ever had at Stanford, but we’ve heard this said
before on the spring practice field. This year though, with 40 fresh
men out, there did seem to be a difference—a certain snap and spark
that hadn’t been evident in years past.
The Stanford coaching staff has been careful about singling out
any individual for praise since the workouts began, but their voices
can’t hide a slight tone of anxiety as they talk about freshman full
back Mike Barnes’ three touchdowns two weeks ago or the long
gainer ripped off hy shifty Tyce Fitzmorris in that same game. Then
there are the surprise performances of yearling Steve Thurlow and
sophomore Reg Rhodes at quarterback and the fine running of Danny
Spence, who played JV hall last year. These are all new faces on
the varsity practice field, but they are probably here to stay.
THEN TOO, there are a number of returning lettermen who will
undoubtedly carry the load next year despite the large freshman
turnout. Returning from the starting eleven of last year are Pursell.
end; Phil Toorvald, tackle; and Chris Cottle, center. Tom Walsh,
who played about equal time with Ron Fernandes at guard, will he
back too, making a total of three and one-half.

Curtice Faces Backfield Headache

Biggest loss, of course, for the Indians was the starting backfield,
and here is where the new faces will be most likely to appear. Rod
Sears seems to have the inside track on the quarterback slot, if for
no other reason than experience. Sears has played behind Norman
for two years now and should be ready to come into his own.
Jim Smith is another possibility here, but even his will be a new
face for some Stanford fans. Smith did not play last year although
he lettered in 1959 as a sophomore. He is currently pitching for
Coach Dutch Fehring’s cellar-bound baseball team.
THE REST of the backfield is anybody’s guess. Returning letter
men for these spots include Ed Cummings, Tim Hanzel, Larry Rovse,
Hal Steubei, Gaiy Craig and Stan Lindskog. Add to these the out
standing freshman already mentioned and such worthy Brave candi
dates as Spence and Mick Doherty and the result is a tough choice
—both to make and to predict.
At any rate it will he a new team, a new system, a now schedule
and we hope some new results. They have im place to go but up’.
