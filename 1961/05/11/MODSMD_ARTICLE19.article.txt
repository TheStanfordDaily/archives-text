# WEST COAST RELAYS
## Track Records Threatened 
### 
A flock of new American col
legiate relay records could be set
at Fresno this Saturday as top
distance teams from Oregon, Ore
gon State and Houston, and out
standing sprint quartets from
San Jose and USC gather for the
33th running of one of the na
tion’s premier track meets, the
West Coast Relays.
THE FOUR-MILE relay mark
is in the greatest danger as all
the afore • mentioned distance

squads are capable of bettering 1
the present lime of 16:50.4 set i
by Western Michigan at the |
Drake Relays.
Oregon will be the favorite in I
the 16-lap race and if their four
some of Dyrol Burleson, George |
Larson, Keith Forman and Vic I
Reeve can combine their best; ’6l
times they could negotiate the j
course in less than 16:30.0.
Norm Fones, Dick Cuddihy,
Dale Storey and Norm Hoffman j
will run for the OSU Beavers
and, while they lost to Michigan ,
State last week, the northwest
erners have some of the fastest j
times in the nation this year.
HOUSTON will be banking on j
John Macy and their three Aus
tralian distance men, A1 Law |
rence, Barry Almond and Pat j
Clohissy.
Southern Cal and San Jose |
should have the field all to them-1
selves in the sprint relays after |
the withdrawal of Abilene Chris- j
tian.
The Spartan 440 and 880 con

t ingents will get a big boost from
the return of Bobby Poynter who
was one of SJS's top runners
last year, but missed all hut three '
of the meets this season. Dennis
•Johnson, who has been clocked
in world record equaling times of
9.3 on three separate occasions
this year, will anchor the Spar
tans’ sprint teams.
OREGON will also enter a 440
squad, consisting of Mike Gaech
ter, Roscoe Cook, Jim Puckett
and Harry Jerome, but bad
weather conditions have limited
their practice sessions and so the
Ducks don’t figure to win in the
shorter events.
Five medal winners from the
1960 Olympic Games will he en
tered in the individual events and
should threaten some U.S. and
world marks.
SHOT-PUTTER Dallas Long,
one of the brightest stars in Tro
jan coach Jess Mortenson’s track
galaxy, will attempt to better his
63-9 effort set at Stanford against
the Indians .and the Ducks.
