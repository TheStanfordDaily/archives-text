# Legality Of Eichmann's Trial Aired
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
“The purpose of law is to serve
justice, not the other way around.
This is the central truth in the
legal controversy concerning the
Eichmann trial.” Howard Sachas,
director of the Hillel Center, said
last night in Cubberley as part
of a panel discussion of the Eich
mann trial.

JAN TRISHA, associate profes
sor of political science, stated,
“Legally the case is dubious. Po
litically, however, no alternative
to the Israeli court is available.
Morally, Israel has its best case.”
The “issue is between unjust
law and unlawful justice,” Triska
continued.

“WE ARE GIVING up impor
tant principles,” Richard Wasser
strom. assistant professor of po
litical science and law. said, “if
we consent to the trial of Eich
mann in Israel.”

Three of these principles, Was
serstrom continued, are “criminal
law should not be retroactive,
each state ought to limit its con
trol to its area of jurisdiction,
and people should not be kid
napped from one state and
brought to another.”
“THE QUESTIONS of law
should really not concern us
here,” Leo Weinstein, associate
professor of French, said. “There
is one huge fact—six million hu
man beings, largely innocent,
were murdered.”
“Every argument that strays
from the magnitude of this crime
against humanity is a harmful
diversion,” Weinstein asserted,
“The first thing which must come
out of this consideration is that
such inhumanity must never hap
pen again,” he said with deep con
viction.
Weinstein lived in Germany un
til 1938, and again from 1944-1916.
IN REPLY TO Wasserstrom’s
and Triska’s expression of the
doubtful legal basis for the Eich
man trial. Sachas reminded the
audience, “there was not one ille
gal act performed by the SS
stormtroopers as they killed their
victims.”
Wasserstrom answered, “It is
precisely the fact that legal sys
tems can he corrupted that Israel
should not try Eichmann.” Ho
posed the question “can we give
up principles of a legal system
just because the person we aie
going to try is an absolutely rep
rehensible person?”

tant principles,” Richard Wasser
strom. assistant professor of po
litical science and law. said, “if
we consent to the trial of Eich
mann in Israel.”

Three of these principles, Was
serstrom continued, are “criminal
law should not be retroactive,
each state ought to limit its con
trol to its area of jurisdiction,
and people should not be kid
napped from one state and
brought to another.”
“THE QUESTIONS of law
should really not concern us
here,” Leo Weinstein, associate
professor of French, said. “There
is one huge fact—six million hu
man beings, largely innocent,
were murdered.”
“Every argument that strays
from the magnitude of this crime
against humanity is a harmful
diversion,” Weinstein asserted,
“The first thing which must come
out of this consideration is that
such inhumanity must never hap
pen again,” he said with deep con
viction.
Weinstein lived in Germany un
til 1938, and again from 1944-1916.
IN REPLY TO Wasserstrom’s
and Triska’s expression of the
doubtful legal basis for the Eich
man trial. Sachas reminded the
audience, “there was not one ille
gal act performed by the SS
stormtroopers as they killed their
victims.”
Wasserstrom answered, “It is
precisely the fact that legal sys
tems can he corrupted that Israel
should not try Eichmann.” Ho
posed the question “can we give
up principles of a legal system
just because the person we aie
going to try is an absolutely rep
rehensible person?”
“The purpose of law is to serve
justice, not the other way around.
This is the central truth in the
legal controversy concerning the
Eichmann trial.” Howard Sachas,
director of the Hillel Center, said
last night in Cubberley as part
of a panel discussion of the Eich
mann trial.

JAN TRISHA, associate profes
sor of political science, stated,
“Legally the case is dubious. Po
litically, however, no alternative
to the Israeli court is available.
Morally, Israel has its best case.”
The “issue is between unjust
law and unlawful justice,” Triska
continued.
