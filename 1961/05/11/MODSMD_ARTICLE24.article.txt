## 
### 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. (UPI) â€”Syracuse University has begun an in
vestigation into complaints of racial discrimination against the col
lege's foreign students.
An exploratory meeting between students and the office of the
Dean of Women was scheduled and a special committee of faculty

members and students was or
dered established to hear griev
ances from students.
The controversy was touched
off by the student newspaper, the
Daily Orange, which charged last
week that the university officials
set up a policy of discouraging
coeds from interracial dating.
The university denied the charge
at a meeting before foreign stu
dents.
Students also complained of dis
crimination in off-campus hous
ing. They called on the university
to take the responsibility of assur
ing non-white foreign students
that they would not suffer em
barrassment or ridicule when
they seek off-campus rooms.
Syracuse has a considerable
number of foreign students, in
cluding Negroes, Indians and
Southeast Asians.
