EN ROUTE WITH JOHNSON
(UPD- Vico President Lyndon B.
Johnson flew toward Viet Nam
yesterday for a meeting with
President Ngo Dinh Diem on the
testing ground of America’s new
determination to halt Communist
guerrilla-type aggression.
The unconfirmed report that
Johnson carried a S4O million of
fer of increased aid to help Viet
Nam fight the Reds with their
own guerrilla methods prompted
a “warning” from Communist
Gen. Vo Ngueyn Giap that this
would be a “dangerous threat to
peace” in Southeast Asia.
The Vico President is scheduled
to meet Diem today.
Johnson was seen off at Hick
am Air Force Base by Adm. Harry
D. Felt, commander of U.S. Pa
cific Forces, who told newsmen
that the U.S. military assistance
group in Viet Nam could easily be
augmented in strength.
“That is a high level decision,”
Felt said, indicating it still was
being studied in Washington.
