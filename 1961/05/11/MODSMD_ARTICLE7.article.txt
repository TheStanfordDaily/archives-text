# Demos Push New School Aid Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Demo
cratic members of the Senate La
bor Committee agreed yesterday
to push a revision in President
Kennedy’s formula for allocating
school aid funds. The change was
designed to win support of law
makers from large industrial
states.

Chairman Lister Hill, D-Ala., of
the labor committee and Chair
man Wayne Morse, D-Oie., of its
education subcommittee predicted
the full committee would approve
Kennedy’s public school aid pro
gram today.

The new formula would .dis
tribute federal grants on the ba
-1 sis of a state’s total school popu
[ lation, including children in pri
, vate and church-supported schools.
I No funds would go to non-public
schools, however.

THIS IS SIMILAR to the for
mula approved by a House Edu
cation Subcommittee Tuesday,
and to a bill passed by the Senate
last; year. Kennedy wanted to
count only students In public
schools in allocating federal as
sistance.
The revised formula, like Ken
nedy’s plan, would give larger
grants to poorer states. But by
including parochial and private
schools in the pupil count, large
industrial slates would get more
money than under the President's
j proposal.
MORSE TOLD reporters the
democratic formula would cost
I more than the $(160 million annual
I outlay requested by Kennedy.
I The Democrats faced the dilem
ma of pleasing both law makers
1 from poorer stales, who want a
j bigger slice of federal school aid
funds, and those from large indus
trial states who also want a hefty
cut.
The school aid bill was expected
to command some GOP support in
the Senate.
