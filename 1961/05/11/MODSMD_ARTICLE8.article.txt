# Rusk Reaffirms Stand In Laos
## Cease Fire Must Come Before Talk 
### 
GENEVA (UPI) Secretary of
State Dean Rusk arrived here last
night and said the United States
will not negotiate at the Laos
peace conference unless an effec
tive cease fire is shown to be in
force in that Southeast Asian
country.
Rusk made it clear as soon as
he stepped from his jet transport
that (he 14 - nation conference
scheduled to begin here tomorrow
would only get off the ground, as
far as the United States is con
cerned, ‘‘lf information from Laos
about a cease fire permits it.”
IN AN airport statement Rusk
said:
“The search for peace in Laos
is worth the best efforts of all
who might come to the (able. We
on our part hope their efforts
will succeed.
“The citizens of the kingdom of
Laos deserve their chance to live
their own lives in peace and tran
quility. Success of the conference
will not only contribute to the
well-being of the people of Laos
but will have a significant influ
ence on the general peace we so
much desire.”
A FEW HOURS earlier, Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromy
ko flew into Geneva and warned
against “procrastination” in end
ing what he called “a war danger
in Southeast Asia.”
Communist Chinese Foreign
Minister Chen Yi was to arrive
today. Other members of the Chi
nese delegation flew in from Mos
cow shortly before Gromyko.
There was no explanation why
Chen stayed over in the Soviet
capital.
U.N. officials who are making
conference preparations have
prepared table signs for the
United States, Britain, France,
Canada, Poland, India, The So
viet Union, Red China, North and
South Vietnam, Thailand, Burma,
Laos and Cambodia. But it was
not certain that all of them would
show up.
