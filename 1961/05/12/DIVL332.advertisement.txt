DR. FROOD'S THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: BEWARE OF SUBLIMINAL ADVERTISING!

Dear Dr. Frood: I’ve been reading a great deal about
automated teaching devices. How long will it be be
fore they come up with machines to replace profes
sors? Professor
DEAR PROFESSOR: Just as soon as they get one that
■ can rap the knuckles of a sleeping student, give
humiliating answers to foolish questions and spring
surprise tests whenever it happens to be in a bad
mood.

Dear Dr. Frood: My problem is fat, stubby fingers.
As a result, I am exceedingly awkward with my hands.
My manual dexterity is so poor, in fact, that I can't
even get a Lucky pack open. What can I do?
Fingers
DEAR FINGERS: Simply strap ordinary sewing needles
along both of your index fingers. Now cup the Lucky
pack in your hands, grasp the little red tab in your
teeth, and yank. Next, place the pack on a flat surface
and secure it between two unabridged dictionaries.
Then, with the right-hand needle, carefully, carefully
carve a one-inch-square opening at the top right-hand
corner. Finally, place the points of the needles firmly
against the sides of a Lucky and lift. That’s all there
is to it. A word of warning though: Try to be careful
when shaking hands.
Dear Dr. Frood: In the four years I've been at this
college I've done some pretty horrible things. I am
guilty, for instance, of into and
around the home of Professor ■■■§. I'm also
ashamed of the Board of Regents,
and completely the campus police

Can I, in good conscience, even accept a diploma
from dear old mmmmm?
DEAR wmßmmaßtummmm ■ You can if you send $5OO
in unmarked bills to Dr. Frood, Box 2990, Grand Cen
tral Station, New York 17, N. Y. If you don't, I'll print
your letter without the little black lines.
Dear Dr. Frood; Don’t you think it’s wrong for a boy
and girl to marry while they're still in school?
Soc. Mafor
DEAR SOC.: Yes, they should
at least wait until recess.
THE HANDWRITING IS ON THE WALL, says Dr. Frood. Or, more exactly, on the
blackboard. It's appearing on college blackboards everywhere; “College students
smoke more Luckies than any other regular.” Why is this statement showing up on
college blackboards? Because I am paying agents to put it there. For you must
remember that Luckies are the cigarette with taste—the emphatic toasted taste. Try
a pack of Luckies today.

DEAR wmßmmaßtummmm ■ You can if you send $5OO
in unmarked bills to Dr. Frood, Box 2990, Grand Cen
tral Station, New York 17, N. Y. If you don't, I'll print
your letter without the little black lines.
Dear Dr. Frood; Don’t you think it’s wrong for a boy
and girl to marry while they're still in school?
Soc. Mafor
DEAR SOC.: Yes, they should
at least wait until recess.
THE HANDWRITING IS ON THE WALL, says Dr. Frood. Or, more exactly, on the
blackboard. It's appearing on college blackboards everywhere; “College students
smoke more Luckies than any other regular.” Why is this statement showing up on
college blackboards? Because I am paying agents to put it there. For you must
remember that Luckies are the cigarette with taste—the emphatic toasted taste. Try
a pack of Luckies today.

Dear Dr. Frood: I’ve been reading a great deal about
automated teaching devices. How long will it be be
fore they come up with machines to replace profes

Dear Dr. Frood: My problem is fat, stubby fingers.
As a result, I am exceedingly awkward with my hands.
My manual dexterity is so poor, in fact, that I can't
even get a Lucky pack open. What can I do?
Fingers
DEAR FINGERS: Simply strap ordinary sewing needles
along both of your index fingers. Now cup the Lucky
pack in your hands, grasp the little red tab in your
teeth, and yank. Next, place the pack on a flat surface
and secure it between two unabridged dictionaries.
Then, with the right-hand needle, carefully, carefully
carve a one-inch-square opening at the top right-hand
corner. Finally, place the points of the needles firmly
against the sides of a Lucky and lift. That’s all there
is to it. A word of warning though: Try to be careful
when shaking hands.
Dear Dr. Frood: In the four years I've been at this
college I've done some pretty horrible things. I am
guilty, for instance, of into and
