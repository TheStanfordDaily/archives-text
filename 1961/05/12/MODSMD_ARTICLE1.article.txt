# Action to Censure Mich. Daily Fails
## 
### GREGG HOPKINS 
Assistant to the Editor
The University of Michigan
Daily was threatened last week
by the school’s student legisla
ture with a motion of censure
for an “apparent trend towards
irresponsibility in news reporting
and editorial comment.”
This motion was defeated by
voice vole in a meeting Wednes
day night of the University’s Stu
dent Government Council, Michi
gan Daily City Editor Phil Sher
man told the Stanford Daily last
night via long-distance telephone.
IN ITS STEAD was substi
tuted a study motion proposed
by a member of the paper’s edi
torial staff calling for the council
to meet with the Daily editors
and confer about the paper’s
"problems and difficulties,” and
to familiarize the Council with
the paper’s entire staff and prob
lems.
The furor came to a head when
the Michigan Daily published
what Sherman called “a semi
secret report” on living condi
tions in a freshman men’s dor
mitory, Certain members of the
Student Council thought this irre
sponsible since it might raise
doubts in the minds of parents
of incoming freshmen as to the
quality of the dorms and the ad
visability of sending a child to
live in one, said Sherman.
SHERMAN said “ a personal
clique of student leaders is
against us because we have either

criticized their organizations or
not printed what they think is a
sufficient amount of news about
their organizations.”
The report in question, called
the Scheub Report, a collection of
interviews by resident advisers
with about 50 freshmen, showed
freshmen to be dissatisfied with
their accommodations.
At a meeting of the Student
Government Council on May 3,
Michigan junior James Yost put
forth a motion expressing “grave
concern over . . . irresponsibility
... in the Daily," stating the
paper had neglected its “responsi
bility to improve the image of
the University, the student and
itself in the eyes of the admin
istration and other people.”
VOST SAID that recent articles
had not adhered to a Code of
Ethics for the publication adopted
in 1940 which states that the re
porting in news and editorial col
umns shall be “calm, fair and
intelligent.”
The council was divided on the
alleged “irresponsibility.” It was
charged at the meeting that the
underlying intention of Yost’s
motion was to gratify personal
grievances. The Interfraternity
President charged that rushing
had been deliberately played
ttown and that fraternity presi
dents have frequently been mis
represented.
In an editorial on May 6, the
Michigan Daily, long one of the
country’s outstanding college
publications, answered that it
would be a “disaster” if the coun
cil's “discussion of the Daily's
alleged irresponsibility turned in
to a series of vindictive charges,
counter-charges and rationaliza
tions.”
IF THE REPORT on the dor
mitories is true, the paper said,
then "the Daily in publishing it
is simply reporting news and de
scribing a deplorable situation
which should be brought into the
light and rectified.
“The fact that certain articles
may reflect badly on individuals
or groups is not a valid criticism
as long as the articles are true,”
said the editorial. “The Daily is
not responsible for maintaining
the University’s reputation by
suppressing news which might
make the administration or
alumni unhappy,”
The Michigan Daily is not con
trolled by the Student Govern
ment Council, but is under the
Board of Control of Student Pub
lications consisting of faculty,
administration, students and |
alumni in professional journal
ism. City Editor Sherman expec
ted no action from this group
because the Code of Ethics had
not been shown to be broken.

The University of Michigan
Daily was threatened last week
by the school’s student legisla

for an “apparent trend towards
irresponsibility in news reporting
and editorial comment.”
This motion was defeated by
voice vole in a meeting Wednes
day night of the University’s Stu

gan Daily City Editor Phil Sher
man told the Stanford Daily last
night via long-distance telephone.
IN ITS STEAD was substi

by a member of the paper’s edi
torial staff calling for the council
to meet with the Daily editors
and confer about the paper’s
"problems and difficulties,” and
to familiarize the Council with
the paper’s entire staff and prob
lems.
The furor came to a head when
the Michigan Daily published
what Sherman called “a semi
secret report” on living condi
tions in a freshman men’s dor
mitory, Certain members of the
Student Council thought this irre
sponsible since it might raise
doubts in the minds of parents
of incoming freshmen as to the
quality of the dorms and the ad
visability of sending a child to
live in one, said Sherman.
SHERMAN said “ a personal
clique of student leaders is
against us because we have either

criticized their organizations or
not printed what they think is a
sufficient amount of news about
their organizations.”
The report in question, called
the Scheub Report, a collection of
interviews by resident advisers
with about 50 freshmen, showed
freshmen to be dissatisfied with
their accommodations.
At a meeting of the Student
Government Council on May 3,
Michigan junior James Yost put
forth a motion expressing “grave
concern over . . . irresponsibility
... in the Daily," stating the
paper had neglected its “responsi
bility to improve the image of
the University, the student and
itself in the eyes of the admin
istration and other people.”
VOST SAID that recent articles
had not adhered to a Code of

in 1940 which states that the re

intelligent.”
