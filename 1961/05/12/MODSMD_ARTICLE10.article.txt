# Tyranny in Havana Strengthens Church
## 
### 
Cuba's Fidel Castro seems to be following the pattern of Com
munist dictators elsewhere. He has crushed the remnants of the
rebel invasion force and is now turning his dictatorship toward the
Church. Like most strong-men, he correctly views the Church as the
last focal point for opposition to his regime, and he means to crush it.
One of the first reporters who entered post-invasion Cuba, John
Barnes of the Los Angeles Times, reports a wide scale reign of terror
directed against the Church. He reports that every church and church
school has been taken over by G-2; that priests and nuns are in the
hands of the secret police or have fled the country. Priests are unable
to visit the sick and dying and Castro-created mobs have ransacked
churches. Cuba's eight bishops have either gone into hiding or have
been arrested by Castro intelligence squads. Manuel Cardinal Are
aga has sought asylum in a foreign embassy.
Cubans in the past have not shown as much interest in the Church
as other Latin nations. Only 200 of Cuba's 800 priests are Cuban born,
the rest being mainly Spanish. But Castro's reign of terror has had a
negative effect on this indifferent attitude. Cubans who never have
attended church regularly are now going to Mass, both to support
the priests in their flight and to show their opposition to the Castro
regime. Despite the mobs surrounding the walls of churches yelling
Paredon! Paredon!" (to the execution wall) the toughness of priests
and parishioners shows evidence that the Church will survive this
crisis as it has others in its history,
Castro's reign of terror will have its most important reverbera
tions elsewhere, especially with the lower classes throughout Latin
America. As news of the persecution spreads, these peasants are
bound to lose much of the enchantment they have so far shown
toward revolutionary Cuba and its land reform. This will give both
the United States and the countries to the south a fresh chance to
regain the minds of these peasant classes by attempting a solution
to this most difficult of Latin American problems.
