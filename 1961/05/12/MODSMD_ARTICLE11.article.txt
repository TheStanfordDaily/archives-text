Premature
Recent contributors expressed
disappointment with the first
meeting of the Young Americans
for Freedom. I suggest their dis
pleasure was misplaced and pre
mature. The meeting was strictly
an organizational meeting; ac
tion, if any, will be discussed
more thoroughly in the future.
More important, however, was
the implied criticism of the the
ory of the Young Americans for
Freedom. I must, I feel, express
some thoughts concerning this
criticism. It is the contention of
me and many of my friends that
America’s greatest danger does
not lay with the barbarians now
howling at her gates. Rather,
since her walls are strong and
her army vigilant, the possibility
of internal betrayal represents a
more explicit threat. Such be
trayal, if it comes, will not be
of the Rosenberg-Fuchs variety.
It will at the same time be more
insidious and more open. It will
be a “failure of nerve.”
This failure of nerve threatens
America from three directions.
The theses leading to this failure
can be summarized under three
headings:

A) America’s achievements are
illusory and worthless. This from
the “beats” and religious fanatics.
B) War, including defensive
war, is murder. This attack comes
from the anti-bomb sector.

C) Our only defense against
the aggressors is the adoption of
their methods—if not their phil
osophy. Schlesinger, Bowles, and
Galbraith are represented here.
Up to the present those people
of a ‘conservative’ persuasion
have not felt it was necessary to
defend America’s fundamental
philosophy. Most of them are only
just now beginning to realize the
terrible possibilities of the cur
rent trends and hence are only
beginning to organize the coun
ter-attack.
Before conservatives can coun
ter-attack, however, they will have
to analyse their position. They
will have to marshal their
thoughts into a coherent, rational
and consistent whole. Their phil
osophy must be convinced that
A) our society, by almost any
standards, is superior to any
other, B) Defensive violence is
both legal and recommended by
the Bible and English common
law, C) a totalitarian response

to an exterior threat is likely to
end in a substantive capitulation,
and further that such reactions
markedly reduce a society’s mean
time to failure.
This is what I feel Y.A.F. can
do. If the disappointed corre
spondnets referred ot above pre
fer a more active organization,
I suggest they contact the John
Birch Society which from all re
ports is ‘activist.’ In the mean
time I shall reread my Locke and
Mill.

Defamation
We also attended the first meet
ing of the “Young Americans for
Freedom” but received a rather
different impression than that re
gurgitated by Messrs. Stott, Tip
py, and Wade in yesterday’s
Daily. Their comment was so full
of distorted notions, grandiose,
but empty, words, and self-righte
ous hauteur that we found it im
possible to fully criticize it within
the 250-word limit for letters to
the Daily. Suffice it to say that
the whole point of their letter is
reduced to nothing when one re
alizes that the meeting’s purpose
was simply to organize a society
through which the political enthu
siasm of students of conservative
views could be utilized for the dis
semination of conservative politi
cal views around the campus. No
panacea for all the world’s ills
was presented, nor was a brand
spanking new, utopian political
theory offered. It would have
been a farce had this been the
case.

As for the character defama
tions so blandly perpetuated in
the letter: the students who at
tended could only be described as
average, a fair cross-section of the
student-body. From our view
point, and we were impartial ob
servers certainly, being far left in
these matters, Messrs. Stott, Tip
py, and Wade could not have been
discerned from the “stultifying
assemblage of intellectual rabble”
which they claimed to have found
there.
In short, we find little in their
letter to indicate that they even
attended the meeting and would
like to caution the student-body
about accepting a voice such as
this on any matter of importance.
