# AT SUNKEN DIAMOND TODAY
## Cards Meet Trojans 
### 
Coach Dutch Fehring’s base
ball nine really has its work cut
out this afternoon when the na
tion’s No. 1 team, USC, invades
the Sunken Diamond at 3:15.
Tomorrow the Cards meet
Santa Clara in a doubleheader
starting at 1:00 p.m„ also at the
Sunken Diamond.
TIIK TROJANS already hold
two decisions over the Indians
in a pair of games played in the
Southland earlier in the season.
As it looks from the national
scene, .Southern California, Fres
no State, and Oregon State ap
pear to have (be best chances of
winning the District 8 berth in
the NCAA college baseball world
series at Omaha June 9-14.
USC, ranked the No, 1 team
in the land by coaches, has posted

a 33-6 reco r d, despite a long,
tough schedule. The Trojans
placed seco n d at Omaha last
year.
THE MEN from “down south”
can clinch another California In
tercollegiate Baseball Association
crown (CIBAt and automatic se
lection to the District 8 playoff
this weekend.
A victory over Stanford today
and a split with Cal tomorrow!
would do it for the Trojans. But
don't let anybody tell you the
Cards and Bears won’t put up a
battle.
For the Cards Bob Overman
will do the catching; Lee Moench
will guard first base; Mike Magee
will play second; Joel Schulman
will be at shortstop; Rich Fer
razzano will hold down the hot
corner. The outfield will be com
posed of John Hurlbut in left,
Hal Schutzmann in center and
Skip Lawrence in right.
ACTUALLY California still has
a chance to claim a playoff spot,
if the Bears win all six remaining
games on their slate.
Fresno State, with a 32-6 rec
ord and ranked second nationally, j
is considered an almost sure bet |
to win the California at-large des- j
ignation.

The Bulldogs are 14-1 in the
California Collegiate Athletic
Association.
