# Don Carter Seeks Title
## 
### 
If Don Carter wins the $75,000
Professional Bowlers’ Association
Invitational Tournament that
opened yesterday in Pa ram us,
N.J., they’ll have to invent new
worlds for him to conquer.
The 34-year-old St. Louis ace
Wednesday night won the one
major title that had eluded him—
the American Bowling Congress
masters championship.
“THIS IS the one I wanted,”
said mild-mannered Don after de
feating Dick Hoover of St. Louis,
888-826, in four games for the
crown in a sensational battle.
Carter, five times “bowler of
the year,” had won the National
All-Star Tournament four times,
the World’s Invitational three
times and the first PBA Open last
fall.
But he never had been able to
win the masters, a special event
for the country’s top howlers in
augurated 11 years ago in St.
Paul.
TIIK $2,820 Carter won is a
masters record. He received $2.-
500 for first place and $320 for
eight match victories.
Carter is a favorite for the top
prize of $15,000 in the Paramus
tournament.
