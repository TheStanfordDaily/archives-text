### United Press International 
Billy Klaus' grand-slam homer plus homers by Gene Woodling
and Dale Long powered the down-trodden Washington Senators to
a 9-4 victory over the league-leading Detroit Tigers yesterday.
Klaus blast, the second grand-slam of his major league career,
highlighted a six-run rally in the fifth inning that put the Senators in

front to stay.
WOODLING’S fourth homer of
the season, a two-run wallop, also
came in the fifth and helped
Washington wipe out a 3-0 de
ficit.
Long then led off the sixth
with his third homer of the year
and the Senators added single
runs in the seventh and eighth.
Reliefer Marty Kutyna took
over in the fifth and held the
Tigers to one run on four hits
for his second win against no
losses.
DETROIT starter Bill Fischer
had the Senators under control
until the fifth when he was
yanked and three hurlers paraded
from the bullpen to the mound
for Detroit, none proving effec
tive.
John Gabler started for Wash
ington and was tagged for three
runs and seven hits in four in
nings. The lone run yielded by
Kutyna was a pinch homer by
Ozz.ie Virgil in the fifth.
The Baltimore Orioles defeated
the Minnesota Twins, 8-7, when
Paul Giel walked Ron Hansen
with the bases full in the eighth
inning to produce what turned
out to be the winning run.
STEVE Barber was credited
with his fourth victory although
Hoyt Wilhelm relieved him in the
sixth when the Twins scored
three runs to cut Baltimore’s load
to 7-6.
The Orioles collected only nine
hits to 14 for the Twins but were
aided by five Minnesota errors.
Camilo Pascual was the loser.
No other major league games
were scheduled.
