# Covington Gets 'Life'

It looked like the end of the
major league trail yesterday for
baseball veterans George Crowe,
Willie Jones and Joe Ginsberg,
but Wes Covington drew “life”
with the Chicago White Sox.
Crowe and Ginsberg were
among a group of players sent
to the minors Wednesday and
Jones was given his outright re
lease as the 18 major league clubs
pared their rosters to the re
quired 25-man limit.
COVINGTON, who has been in
an almost continuous fight with
the Milwaukee front office since
joining the organization in 1952,
became a part of the last-minute
juggling when the Braves dealt
him to the Chicago White Sox
for the $20,000 waiver price.
The 29-year-old Covington
never has lived up to the promise
he showed as a rookie in 1958
when he smacked 24 homers and
batted in 74 runs for the Braves
in only 90 games.
Hampered by bad knees, he hit
only 10 homers with 35 RBl’s the
following season, and when the
Braves attempted to cut his sal
ary the past two years, he bick
ered long and loud,
Milwaukee finally tossed in the
towel Wednesday after the big
outfielder hit under .200 in nine
games this year.
Of his four hits, only one was
for extra bases and that was a
double.
With the White Sox, he has a
good chance to gain a starting
job.
