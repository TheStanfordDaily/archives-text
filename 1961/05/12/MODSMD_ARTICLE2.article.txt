# Buckley to Talk Here Monday
## 
### 
“The most dangerous under
graduate Yale has seen in years’’
will appear at Stanford Monday
when Political Union presents
William F. Buckley, editor of The
National Review, an influential
right-wing conservative magazine.
During his discussion of “Lib
eral Ideology and American For
eign Policy’’ Buckley will be ques
tioned by a panel of Professors
Thomas Bailey and Otis Pease of
the history department and Ed
ward Shaw of the economics de
partment. The discussion will
take place at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium.
As a controversial author and
editor he has been fired upon
from right, left, and center. By
his own definition, a "radical con
servative,’’ he is the declared en
emy of what he calls “the passion
for modulation.” The variety of
epithets attached to him attest to
his belligerance on this issue.
The Buckley “labels” range
from “black reactionary,” to “a
true liberal in the old traditional
sense.” to “a child of the Middle
Ages.”
Tickets for the discussion are
available at the ASSU office for
50 cents.
Although safely graduated
from Yale, Buckley has invited
even more colorful “labels” by
writing three widely read, hotly
debated books.
