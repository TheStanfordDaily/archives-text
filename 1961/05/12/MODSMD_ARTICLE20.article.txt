## Big Winds May Peril Relays 
### 
The hope around Fresno yester
day was that the strong winds
would subside so that tomorrow’s
35th running of the West Coast
Relays might produce the number
of records that could occur under
proper conditions.
“The only thing we don’t have
under control is the weather,” say
West Coast Relays director J.
Flint Banner. "I’m afraid the
wind will whip up and spoil many
fine performances.”
GENERALLY the weather has
been good for all West Coast Re
lays in recent years.
Last year winds were light for
the 100-yard dash wdien Occiden
tal’s Doug Smith upset Ray Nor
ton of San Jose State in 9.4 sec
onds.
At that time they were saying
that Norton was the “World’s
fastest human.” His subsequent
failure at Rome ended all such
talk.
Strangely, Smith again will he
the underdog. This time it is an
other San Jose State sprinter who
has the track world gasping. His
name is Dennis Johnson.
THE JAMAICAN has equalled
the 9.3 world record four limes
this season already and has run
a wind-aided 9.2. it is not neces
sary to state that he is ready to
break through the supposedly
“unbreakable barrier.”
Oregon Coach Bill Bowerman
will use his speedsters, Roscoe
Cook and Harry Jerome, only in
relay events because “the weather
in Oregon has been too bad to get
ready.”
In the field events the outstand
ing performer is Dallas Long of
USC. Long—the finest college
shot putter in the land—is in a
class by himself and has a best of
64 feet 3 V2 inches this year. He
makes the 16-pound ball look like
a golf ball.
RINK BABKA, formerly of
USC and co-holder of the world
discus mark at 196-6’a, tries again
for 200 feet.
San Jose and USC figure to
dominate the sprint relays, but
tough competition can be expect
ed from the likes of Oregon, New
Mexico, Occidental, and UCLA.
Stanford has entered a team in
the distance medley.

Oregon's quartet anchored by
the brilliant Dyrol Burleson aims
at the American four-mile relay
record of 16 minutes 50.4 seconds
set by Western Michigan at the
Drake Relays.

the underdog. This time it is an
other San Jose State sprinter who
has the track world gasping. His
name is Dennis Johnson.
THE JAMAICAN has equalled
the 9.3 world record four limes
this season already and has run
a wind-aided 9.2. it is not neces
sary to state that he is ready to
break through the supposedly
“unbreakable barrier.”
Oregon Coach Bill Bowerman
will use his speedsters, Roscoe
Cook and Harry Jerome, only in
relay events because “the weather
in Oregon has been too bad to get
ready.”
In the field events the outstand
ing performer is Dallas Long of
USC. Long—the finest college
shot putter in the land—is in a
class by himself and has a best of
64 feet 3 V2 inches this year. He
makes the 16-pound ball look like
a golf ball.
RINK BABKA, formerly of
USC and co-holder of the world
discus mark at 196-6’a, tries again
for 200 feet.
San Jose and USC figure to
dominate the sprint relays, but
tough competition can be expect
ed from the likes of Oregon, New
Mexico, Occidental, and UCLA.
Stanford has entered a team in
the distance medley.

Oregon's quartet anchored by
the brilliant Dyrol Burleson aims
at the American four-mile relay
record of 16 minutes 50.4 seconds
set by Western Michigan at the
Drake Relays.
The hope around Fresno yester
day was that the strong winds
would subside so that tomorrow’s
35th running of the West Coast
Relays might produce the number
of records that could occur under
proper conditions.
“The only thing we don’t have
under control is the weather,” say
West Coast Relays director J.
Flint Banner. "I’m afraid the
wind will whip up and spoil many
fine performances.”
GENERALLY the weather has
been good for all West Coast Re
lays in recent years.
Last year winds were light for
the 100-yard dash wdien Occiden
tal’s Doug Smith upset Ray Nor
ton of San Jose State in 9.4 sec
onds.
At that time they were saying
that Norton was the “World’s
fastest human.” His subsequent
failure at Rome ended all such
talk.
Strangely, Smith again will he
the underdog. This time it is an
other San Jose State sprinter who
has the track world gasping. His
name is Dennis Johnson.
