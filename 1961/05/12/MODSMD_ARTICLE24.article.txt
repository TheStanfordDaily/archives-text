# IIR Africa Desk Looks for Truck
## 
### 
If anyone knows of a truck the
HR Africa Desk could use to take
about 33,000 books to a San Bruno
warehouse, he should contact the
HR as soon as possible, according
to Bob Almanzan, chairman of the
Books for Africa drive.
Books will bo taken to a ware
house the Navy is allowing the
HR to use for sorting and inven
tory and will be stored there this
summer until orders are placed
for them from Africa.

Probably two trips will be need
ed to transport the books, depend
ing on tho size of the truck. The
HR can be reached at DA 1-2300,
ext. 2194.
