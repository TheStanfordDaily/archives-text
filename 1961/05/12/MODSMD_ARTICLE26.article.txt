# Cuba Says Guatemala Set to Fake Attack
## 
### 
MIAMI (UPD— Cuba charged
yesterday Guatemala was plan
ning to fake an attack on itself
as a pretext for declaring war on
Cuba.
A Havana radio broadcast moni
tored here quoted “Guatemalan
patriots” and a Guatemalan stu
dent publication. “El Estudiante,”
as the source of its information.
It was not entirely clear
whether the paper was the only
source of Havana’s information
or whether the “Guatemalan pa
triots” referred to were not con
nected to the student report.

The broadcast claimed Presi
dent Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes of
Guatemala had ordered “numer
ous Yankee combat planes” paint
ed with the Cuban flag “to start
whenever Washington orders it,
permitting a declaration of war
against Cuba.”

Havana said it was alerting
world opinion because of “the ex
traordinary g r a v i t y” of the
charge.
Havana also warned that an at
tack on Cuba would be followed
by another attack on another

country but did not say whether
they meant Guatemala, the United
States or what country. Havana
has frequently hinted that Rus
sian rockets would be used
against the United States in case
of a U.S. attack on Cuba.

The broadcast claimed the U.S.
was planning a new invasion of
Cuba, using “counterrevolution
ary arms, Batista war criminals
such as those who are now being
concentrated on the Island of
Vieques, Puerto Rico.”

“Yankee imperialism.” the
broadcast said, “plans to use in
this new aggression Latin Ameri
can cannon fodder supplied by
some of the tyrannies such as that
of Ydigoras Fuentes and put the
monstrous attack, which includes
the bombing of our cities, under
the banner of the Organization of
American States.

“Washington is trying to hide
in this way the hateful participa
tion of the Marines of Mr. Ken
nedy in the invasion of Cuba that
is being prepared with hysteria
and fury.”
