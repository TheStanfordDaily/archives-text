## More Jobs, Higher Pay 
### 
WASHINGTON ( UPII —'Tho na
tion’s employment picture showed
two signs of improvement last
month although joblessness
stayed very high, the Labor De
partment reported yesterday.
Non-farm jobs increased sharp
ly in April for the first time since
last fall. And the work week of
the average factory employe was
longer, giving him more take
home pay.

The number of workers on non
farm payrolls shot up 384,000 for
a total of 52 million. This was
substantially more than the usual
seasonal pickup.
In the factories the average
work week increased by six min
utes to 39.2 hours. This was sig
nificant, the department said, be
cause the figure usually drops af
ter Easter.

Longer hours and a one-cent in
crease in hourly earnings pushed
up the average week’s pay of fac
tory workers to $91.34 during
April. This was 63 cents higher
than in March and more than $1
above the January figure.
Seymour Wolfbein, deputy as
sistant Labor Secretary, said the
April figures showed general im
provement in the employment sit
uation. But he said the real test
will be whether long-term unem
ployment and widespread jobless
ness among family breadwinners
decrease in the coming month.
