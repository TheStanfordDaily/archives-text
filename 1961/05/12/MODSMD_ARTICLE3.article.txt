Judy Waterman (left) plays Princess Lorraine and Dick
Jacqua is Hans, the errant knight, in the Ram's Head pro
duction "Knight in Arms," in its last performances in Me
morial Auditorium tonight and tomorrow.
The final week-end run of the suc
cessful Ram’s Head show, “Knight
in Arms” will begin tonight.
The show', which is an original
production written by Hoddy
Guittard and Doug Johnson and
directed by Tom Bissingcr, has
been critically acclaimed as “lively
and well-done.”

AN ADAPTATION of the leg
end of Ondine, the show stars
Betty Eichler as Ondine, and Dick
Jaqua as Hans, the errant knight.
Kuhleborn, the protector of On
dine and the other water nymphs,
is played by Ron Feinberg. He
tries to convince Ondine not to
give up her immortality to fall in
love with Hans but fails.
Hans takes Ondine off ot the
court of Herzenstein, where his
fiance, Princess Lorraine, played
by Judy Waterman is waiting for
him to return.

OTHER MEMBERS of the court
include Doug Johnson as the Lord
Chamberlain, Bill Siden as the
Royal Theatrical Producer, and
Tim Laddish as Eric, the Nordic
Ambassador.

The royal palace is a sumptu

ous, colorful set which contrasts
greatly with the rustic village,
Ondine’s former home. The sets
were designed by Mary Delafield
to carry out the fairytale mood
of the legend.
One of the special effects is a
modern underwater dance staged
by Mary-Alyce, professional dan
cer and choteographer who ap
peared in the Broadway produc
tion of “Call Mo Madam.’’ and
now works in the Comedia Thea
tre in Palo Alto.
