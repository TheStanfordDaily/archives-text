ATLANTA (UPI) Georgia
Tech announced the tentative ac
ceptance yesterday of three Negro
students for the fall term. They
would be the first members of
their race admitted to the school
since it was founded 76 years ago.
President Dr. Edwin Harrison
issued a prepared statement say
ing acceptance of the Negroes this
September was conditioned on the
"satisfactory completion of the
students’ final semester in high
school or preparatory school.”
Harrison said the applications
of 10 other Negroes were rejected
“on grounds consistent with our
normal admission policy.”

LIFTING of racial barriers at
Tech came exactly four months
after two Negroes were admitted
to the 175-year-old University of
Georgia at Athens under a federal
court injunction issued by U.S.
District Judge William A. Bootle.
Bootle’s order forbidding racial
discrimination at the Athens uni
versity encompassed the entire
university ssytem of which the
Georgia Institute of Technology is
a part. Tech has an enrollment in
excess of 5,000, including 48 wom
en students.

TECH OFFICIALS declined to
reveal the names of the Negroes
accepted or those turned dow'n
but one source tentatively identi

fied the three admitted as Ford
Greene, Ralph A. Long Jr., and
Lawrence Williams. All 13 are
seniors at Atlanta Negro high
Juno.
Admission of the three students
to Tech would make a total of six
Negroes who have breached the
state’s school segregation barriers
since last January.

In addition to the admission of
Hamilton Holmes, 19, and Miss
Charlayne Hunter, 18, to the Uni
versity of Georgia, another Ne
gro, Miss Mary Frances Early,
has been accepted for entrance to
the University’s graduate school
this summer.

schools. They will graduate in
MISSISSIPPI, South Carolina
and Alabama remain the only
southern states with total segre
gation in state-supported schools
and colleges.

“The ultimate decision as to the
admission or rejection of these
students was made by me after
a complete study of their high
school records, college entrance
examination board scores, and the
other factors that normally weigh
in the admission of all our stu
dents,” Harrison said.

But he said no Negro student
applicant w'as rejected “on the
grounds of personal interview
which is also a requirement of
those qualified for admission.”
He noted that last year Tech re
jected over 600 student applicants.
“We expect to reject at least that
number this year,” he added and
called attention to a “toughened
admission policy” adopted in 1957.
