# STANFORD LEADS IN ELECTRONICS
## Research Program Brings industry to Peninsula 
### 
BY C AROLE CBAYNE
Attraction of Stanford’s pro
gram in electronics has made the
Midpeninsula one of the nation’s
most important industrial elec
tronics centers, helping both in
dustry and the University.
This is the explanation for a
fast-growing industry forecast to
reach a billion-dollar investment
by 1965, says L. Farrell McGhie,
assistant dean of the School of
Engineering and assistant direc
tor of development.
ACCORDING TO McGhie, Stan
ford is number one in the country
in electronics research. “Modestly]
we arc among the top (with j
MlT),’’ he says; in the opinion of
many including the electronics
firms who have moved here to be
near Stanford, wo are the top.
Already well over 100 electron
ics firms, including the nation’s I
largest, Hewlett • Packard, have
moved into this area with its pool
of trained technicians and re
search people.
Stanford has graduateed more
Ph.D.’s in electronics in the last !
10 years than any other school
in the c ount r y, and they are j
highly in demand for university!
staffs. Stanford is also in the top
three or four in number of mas
ter’s degrees granted in electron-i
ics. 1,

ELECTRONICS research and
industry grew up together in the
Stanford-Palo Alto area from
humble beginnings in garage labs
and Stanford research. But Stan
ford's high place today, if it can
be attributed to any one man, is
due to Dr. Frederick E. Terman,
dean of engineering and provost
of the University, McGhie says.
The electrical engineering de
partment 30-35 years ago basi
cally concentrated on high volt
age, and Prof. Harris J. Ryan,
“the lightning tamer,” was a na
tional figure in this field.
Instruction in electronics at
Stanford really began in 1924 in
the attic above Ryan’s office.
When Terman became head of
electrical engineering, he worked
on advancing his field, radio. Un
der Terman this attic “communi
cations laboratory” became the
center of electronics at Stanford
from 1924 until the end of World
War 11.
HERE BILE HEWLETT devel
oped the resistance tuned oscil
lator that became the basis of
the Hewlett-Packard Company.
Dr, Edward Ginzton, now head
of Project M, also spent time j
there as a student.
The Varian brothers, encour
aged by joint research with Dr.,

I William Webster Hansen in his
* basement laboratory at Physics
i Corner, developed the Klystron
; tube, making microwave radar
■ possible and helping to win World
i War 11. Hansen eight years later
; j developed the linear accelerator,
, j When World War II started,
j Tcrman left to head a group of
j scientists at Harvard producing
. | radar counter - measures. Many
. j professors went East also, and
. j there was practically nothing in
j electronics on the West Coast.
. j The radar research lab at Har
j vard was built up to 800 re-
I searchers.
AFTER THE WAR Tcrman
j was t'alled back as dean of the
; | Engineering School, and he
I j brought back some of the Har
vard people.
Post-war enrollment was doub
'! ling, and Terman was given the
j opportunity to hand pick his fac
j ully. He was able to attract some
very good men, and his experi-
I once dealing with the government
j during the war helped him to
| attract research contracts.
The high quality staff attracted
good students, and they tend to
get acclimated to Stanford and
| want to stay in the area. Some set
i up businesses here, like the Vari
!an brothers and Hewlett and
j Packard.

INDUSTRIES WANTED to be
close to the supply of high qual
ity electronics people and to keep
up on new developments in re
search going on here. Many com
panies have said the only reason
they set up in this area was to
be close to Stanford.
From seven professors before
the war, Stanford’s electrical en
gineering department has expand
ed to about 35 with 400 under
graduates and graduates each
compared to about TOO under
grads and 25 grads before the
war.
The University now spends
about $3.5 million a year on re
search in electrical engineering.
General Telephone System is
setting up on Page Mill Road
what will be their big research
lab for the entire system because
they feel Stanford is the best
school to be near.
JUST AS electronics firms have
found it advantageous to be near
this center of top research, Stan
ford and the community have
benefited greatly from the
growth of electronics industry
around them.
Professors as well as industry
profit from the intellectual ex
change between research and de
velopment areas. Professors can
also receive pay from industries

for acting as consultants one day t
a week.
With so much research being t
done on campus, a lot of which i
is tied in with the local indus
j tries, professors can stay on cam
! pus during the summer and
j work, receiving additional pay .
| from the research budget. I
PROBABLY EVERY engineer- .
ing professor in the department '
j has had offers of twice his salary
j from industry, McGhie says. With
| these extra benefits, the Univer-
I sity gets a belter chance of com
i peting with industry for the top
| scientists. This competition has
j been a real problem to schools I
j where industry is not so close, j

electrical engineering, he worked
on advancing his field, radio. Un
der Terman this attic “communi
cations laboratory” became the
center of electronics at Stanford
from 1924 until the end of World
War 11.
HERE BILE HEWLETT devel
oped the resistance tuned oscil
lator that became the basis of
the Hewlett-Packard Company.
Dr, Edward Ginzton, now head
of Project M, also spent time j
there as a student.
The Varian brothers, encour
aged by joint research with Dr.,

I William Webster Hansen in his
* basement laboratory at Physics
i Corner, developed the Klystron
; tube, making microwave radar
■ possible and helping to win World
i War 11. Hansen eight years later
; j developed the linear accelerator,
, j When World War II started,
j Tcrman left to head a group of
j scientists at Harvard producing
. | radar counter - measures. Many
. j professors went East also, and
. j there was practically nothing in
j electronics on the West Coast.
. j The radar research lab at Har
j vard was built up to 800 re-
I searchers.
AFTER THE WAR Tcrman
j was t'alled back as dean of the
; | Engineering School, and he
I j brought back some of the Har
vard people.
Post-war enrollment was doub
'! ling, and Terman was given the
j opportunity to hand pick his fac
j ully. He was able to attract some
very good men, and his experi-
I once dealing with the government
j during the war helped him to
| attract research contracts.
The high quality staff attracted
good students, and they tend to
get acclimated to Stanford and
| want to stay in the area. Some set
i up businesses here, like the Vari
!an brothers and Hewlett and
j Packard.

INDUSTRIES WANTED to be
close to the supply of high qual
ity electronics people and to keep
up on new developments in re
search going on here. Many com
panies have said the only reason
they set up in this area was to
be close to Stanford.
From seven professors before
the war, Stanford’s electrical en
gineering department has expand
ed to about 35 with 400 under
graduates and graduates each
compared to about TOO under
grads and 25 grads before the
war.
The University now spends
about $3.5 million a year on re
search in electrical engineering.
General Telephone System is
setting up on Page Mill Road
what will be their big research
lab for the entire system because
they feel Stanford is the best
school to be near.
JUST AS electronics firms have
found it advantageous to be near
this center of top research, Stan
ford and the community have
benefited greatly from the
growth of electronics industry
around them.
Professors as well as industry
profit from the intellectual ex
change between research and de
velopment areas. Professors can
also receive pay from industries

for acting as consultants one day t
a week.
With so much research being t
done on campus, a lot of which i
is tied in with the local indus
j tries, professors can stay on cam
! pus during the summer and
j work, receiving additional pay .
| from the research budget. I
PROBABLY EVERY engineer- .
ing professor in the department '
j has had offers of twice his salary
j from industry, McGhie says. With
| these extra benefits, the Univer-
I sity gets a belter chance of com
i peting with industry for the top
| scientists. This competition has
j been a real problem to schools I
j where industry is not so close, j
The University also gets gifts
j from industries which recognize |
| the advantages Stanford has to |
| offer them and desire to make I
| it stronger. Palo Alto of course j
I benefits from the growth of in- j
j dustry through taxes. The tax j
( base here has gone down while
I in most other areas it has gone
up.
Leaders of industry have also
j given their leadership to the com
! munity on the city council, cham
j her of commerce, board of edu
[ cation, and as Stanford trustees.
