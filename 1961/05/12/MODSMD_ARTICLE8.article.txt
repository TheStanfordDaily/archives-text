# LASSU Chapp ie Censure Motion Fails
## Bid to Withhold Editor's Salary Also Defeated 
### 
BY FRANCES FISHER
The "crude, vulgar but funny" Chaparral parody of Playboy
Magazine came under fire by LASSU last night, but after discussion,
LASSU defeated 13-1 a resolution to censure Editor Brad Efron.
The specific adjectives "crude, vulgar but funny" were used by
loy Howard, Lagunita representative, but they were echoed by
nearly every member of Legislature.

AS ED CUTTER, who intro
duced the censure resolution, put
it, “1 laughed and thought it was
funny, but it was not funny as the
Stanford Chaparral, as a publi
cation representing Stanford Uni
versity.” Cutter is administrative
assistant to ASSU President
Larry Royse.
Assistant Student Financial
Manager Han Sywter cast the
single affirmative vote. Kay Hart
shorn, Ruble representative, Ward
Mac Donald, a graduate represen
tative and Bud Ratts, off-campus
representative abstained from
voting.

In the I’esolution Cutter pro
posed to withhold payment of
Efron's salary for this month and
to dismiss him from the Chapar
ral staff if “further distasteful is
sues” were published.
ESPECIALLY criticized was
the “Ribald Classic” which Todd
Stewart, ASSU student financial
manager, termed “a gi'eat insult
to many people and a terrible
thing to say about the leading re
ligion of the country.”
Cutter quoted Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler as saying
in effect that this issue will raise
the biggest stink among the fac
ulty and alumni of anything the
students have done in recent
years.
In defense of the issue, Efron
said the magazine was a parody
“and a good one” on Playboy Mag
azine, a publication “which is de
voted to self-gratification, espe
cially sexual gratification. There
fore, to be a good parody, it was
necessary to play up the sex as
pect of the magazine.”
EFRON ALSO pointed out that
the sales of the magazine were
the best in five years. Charles
Landis, Chappie business mana
ger, said that only 80 copies of
the magazine are left and that
they will sell for $1 each. Issues
on newsstands are being recalled.
The adverse effect on the
alumni, the poor taste of the mag
azine and the unsophisticated
style of the parody were pointed
out as supporting arguments for
the resolution of censure.
ARGUMENTS against the reso
lution included Nancy Sherwood’s,
“it is not up to Legislature, hut
up to the students whether or not
they want this type of magazine.
We should not kow tow to what
the alumni think—we should not
let this factor encroach on what
we want to do,” she said.
IN OTHER action Legislature
unanimously adopted a resolu
tion asking Dean Craig to with
draw his recent prohibition of
two-day overnights for those al
ready planned and for a commit
tee to submit a recommendation
regarding future policy on two
night overnights.
Swyter, author of the resolu
tion, said Craig had not given rea
sons for his action other than
saying “an overnight is AN over
night.” He said the prohibition
would have financial repercussion
for the groups which planned
overnights for this weekend, since
deposits had been made for ac
commodations for the overnights.

Swyter mentioned that two 2-
night overnights were held last
year and that the “sudden prohi
bition was unfair.”
SANDY MeCARTY, ASSU vice
president, said that many of the
overnights were registered late.
Craig told The Daily last night
that the two-night overnights of
last year wei’e not approved by
him and that he did not know
how they got through. He stated
that he felt it was “redundant to
issue a ruling for something that
one night and has always been
understood as such.”

In the I’esolution Cutter pro
posed to withhold payment of
Efron's salary for this month and
to dismiss him from the Chapar
ral staff if “further distasteful is
sues” were published.
ESPECIALLY criticized was
the “Ribald Classic” which Todd
Stewart, ASSU student financial
manager, termed “a gi'eat insult
to many people and a terrible
thing to say about the leading re
ligion of the country.”
Cutter quoted Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler as saying
in effect that this issue will raise
the biggest stink among the fac
ulty and alumni of anything the
students have done in recent
years.
In defense of the issue, Efron
said the magazine was a parody
“and a good one” on Playboy Mag
azine, a publication “which is de
voted to self-gratification, espe
cially sexual gratification. There
fore, to be a good parody, it was
necessary to play up the sex as
pect of the magazine.”
EFRON ALSO pointed out that
the sales of the magazine were
the best in five years. Charles
Landis, Chappie business mana
ger, said that only 80 copies of
the magazine are left and that
they will sell for $1 each. Issues
on newsstands are being recalled.
The adverse effect on the
alumni, the poor taste of the mag
azine and the unsophisticated
style of the parody were pointed
out as supporting arguments for
the resolution of censure.
ARGUMENTS against the reso
lution included Nancy Sherwood’s,
“it is not up to Legislature, hut
up to the students whether or not
they want this type of magazine.
We should not kow tow to what
the alumni think—we should not
let this factor encroach on what
we want to do,” she said.
IN OTHER action Legislature
unanimously adopted a resolu
tion asking Dean Craig to with
draw his recent prohibition of
two-day overnights for those al
ready planned and for a commit
tee to submit a recommendation
regarding future policy on two
night overnights.
Swyter, author of the resolu
tion, said Craig had not given rea
sons for his action other than
saying “an overnight is AN over
night.” He said the prohibition
would have financial repercussion
for the groups which planned
overnights for this weekend, since
deposits had been made for ac
commodations for the overnights.

Swyter mentioned that two 2-
night overnights were held last
year and that the “sudden prohi
bition was unfair.”
SANDY MeCARTY, ASSU vice
president, said that many of the
overnights were registered late.
Craig told The Daily last night
that the two-night overnights of
last year wei’e not approved by
him and that he did not know
how they got through. He stated
that he felt it was “redundant to
issue a ruling for something that
one night and has always been
understood as such.”

The "crude, vulgar but funny" Chaparral parody of Playboy
Magazine came under fire by LASSU last night, but after discussion,
LASSU defeated 13-1 a resolution to censure Editor Brad Efron.
The specific adjectives "crude, vulgar but funny" were used by
loy Howard, Lagunita representative, but they were echoed by
nearly every member of Legislature.

AS ED CUTTER, who intro

it, “1 laughed and thought it was
funny, but it was not funny as the
Stanford Chaparral, as a publi

versity.” Cutter is administrative
assistant to ASSU President
Larry Royse.
Assistant Student Financial

single affirmative vote. Kay Hart
