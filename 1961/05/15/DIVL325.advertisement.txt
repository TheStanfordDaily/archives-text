LUCKY STRIKE PRESENTS:

J DR. FROOO'S THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: Don t let CXUITIS UJISCt YOU.
After all, there arc worse things—distemper, hunger, insatiable thirst.
Dear Dr. Frood: Shouldn't we spend our
millions on education instead of a
race to the moon? Taxpayer

Dear Dr.
Frood: What
would you say
about a rich father
who makes his boy
exist on a measly
$l5O a week allowance?
Angered
DEAR ANGERED; I would
say, “There goes a man
I’d like to
call Dad.”
DEAR TAXPAYER: And let the
Communists get all that
cheese?

Dear Dr. Frood: A fellow on our campus
keeps saying, “Bully," “Pip-pip,”
"’Ear, ’ear," “Sticky wicket," and
“Ripping!" What do these things
mean?
Puzzled
DEAR PUZZLED: It’s best
just to ignore these
beatniks.
Dear Dr. Frood: How can I keep from bawling like
a baby when they hand me my diploma?
Emotional
DEAR EMOTIONAL: Simply concentrate
on twirling your mortarboard tassel
in circles above your head,
and pretend you are
a helicopter.

Dear Dr. Frood: What’s the
best way to open a pack of Luckies;
Rip off the whole top, or tear along one
side of the blue sticker?
Freshman
DEAR FRESHMAN: Rip? Tear? Why, open a
pack of Luckies as you would like to be
opened yourself.
FROOD REVEALS SECRET: After exhaustive study and research, Dr. Frood claims to
have discovered the reason why college students smoke more Luckies than any other
regular. His solution is that the word “Collegiates" contains precisely the same
number of letters as Lucky Strike —a claim no other leading cigarette can make!
CHANGE TO LUCKIES and get some fasfe for a change!
