Following is the complete text
of Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler’s statement explaining
the suspension of the Chaparral
for the rest of the year and the
suspension of Chappie editor
Brad Efron:
“WHATEVER the intent of its
editors, the May issue of the
Chaparral was outside the bounds
of propriety and acceptable taste.
“Freedom of the individual is
not at issue here. The Chaparral
is an official publication of the
Stanford students; as such it rep
resents the University in signifi
cant respects. Neither are wo
concerned at this point with mini
mum standards of legal require
ments for decency. The Univer
sity justifiably expects and re
quires that any Stanford publi
cation meets substantially higher
standards in this respect than the
minimum allowed in pulp maga
zines.
“BV ADMINISTRATIVE ac
tion, the Chaparral will suspend
publication for the rest of the
academic year, and the editor has
been suspended similarly for the
rest of the year. As a condition
for the resumption of publication
next autumn, the Associated Stu
dents will be required to demon
strate that there will be in the
future an adequate exercise of
student responsibility for the pub
lication.”
