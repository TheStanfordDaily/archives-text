### 
Scapegoat
(Editor’s Note: The following; tet
ter is a copy of one written by
Han Swyter, Assistant Student
Financial Manager, to Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler. It
is published here at Swyter’s re
quest.)
This letter is to protest your
suspending Brad Efron. It is not
to defend Efron. I am objecting
to the means by which he was
judged and to the penalty im
posed. This protest is intended to
express my concern over your
method of handling the case and
my feeling that the punishment
imposed will inhibit students
from criticizing Stanford or ex
pressing any opinion in the future
which may differ from the view
point held by the faculty or ad
ministration for fear of being sub
jected to similar arbitrary action,
not for what they say, hut for
saying it.

I will concede that, as editor,
Brad Efron showed very poor
judgment and acted irresponsibly
in permitting the publication of
the “Layboy” issue of the Chap
arral, which was crude and taste
less. The issue is indefensible, and
Efron should be disciplined. I ex
pressed this viewpoint at Legis
lature when, as a substitute mem
ber, 1 cast the only affirmative
vote for acensure motion. My pro
test is not, therefore, concerned
directly with Efron or the Chap
arral.

I am aware that Stanford must
maintain a satisfactory public
image in order to maintain its
rating as one of the outstanding
universities of this nation. This
image is as important to the stu
dents as to the administration,
particularly at this point in the
PACE program. I recognize your
responsibility for students’" ac
tions in this field and your
responsibility, however reluctant
you may be, to discipline indi
viduals when necessary. Never
theless, your action exceeded
what was necessary under the
circumstances. I agree with your
conclusion that Efron had to be
disciplined and agree that, be
cause Legislature failed to take
appropriate action and, conse
quently, prevented Men’s Council
from assuming jurisdiction, you
were justified in taking action.
However, I suggest that a more

tactful means would have been
for you to refer the case to the
Council and suggest, as they pre
dictably would, that they disqual
ify themselves. Such procedures
would have been in accord with
the agreement, embodied in the
Fundamental Standard, between
the administration and the Asso
ciated Students, that we take re
sponsibility, individually and col
lectively, for recommending dis
ciplinary action against students
in such matters.
My objection, however, Is to
(he severity of the disciplinary
action which you imposed after
assuming jurisdiction and to the
apparent reasons for it. From all
appearances, Efron has become a
scapegoat. He has been sacrificed
to appease the public, particularly
possible donors of funds. Conse
quently, I deplore your action for
the results it will have. It is a
threat to any student who may
wish to responsibly criticize the
students, faculty, alumni, or ad
ministration. Your action engen
ders fear in those of us who
value our records at Stanford and
still wish to say what we feel is
right. The implication exists that
similar action may be taken
against other individuals for rea
sonable expression of opinion
which may, nevertheless, reflect
poorly on our public image.
With all due respect, I remain,
HAN SWYTER

Engineers Stereoed?
Lest the stereotyped conde
scending attitude towards engi
neers, viz. the poor illiterate slobs,
become too much of a habit on
campus, let me point out that in
many cases it turns out to be
considerably easier for someone
long exposed to the mental disci
pline of the natural sciences, to
also acquire an understanding of
Keats, than it does for the French
major to assimilate quantum me
chanics.
In any case, if sly digs regard
ing anyone’s literary ambitions
must be made, I would doubt
whether The Daily is the place
to make them, at least not as
long as that newspaper insists
on spelling Mozart with tz (last
issue, fall quarter).
