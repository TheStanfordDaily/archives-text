## Congo Crucial Test For UN's Stability 
### 
Tlie United Nations is today at
its most critical juncture and
Moscow is throwing rocks on the
track.
The U.N. must either move
ahead to prove that it can be an
effective means to secure the sta
bility and independence of the
new nations. Or it is going to
grind to an impotent stop when
it is most needed.
THE CRUCIAL test is in the
Congo. There under the most ad
verse circumstances--a combina
tion of disunity within the U.N.
and disunity in the Congo—the
United Nations’ ability to shelter
the birth of a new nation is being
tried under fire.
If it can succeed in the Congo
against such despairing odds, the
U.N. will gain such strength and
prestige as will enable it to do
more of the same in other trouble
spots.
Will the U.N. succeed? Not if
the Soviet Union can prevent it
and it is throwing up every possi
ble roadblock.
IT IS NO accident that at the
moment when the United Nations
is beginning to demonstrate its
greatest usefulnes, Premier Khru
shchev is stepping up his fight to
derail the U.N.’s driving engine,
the office of the Secretary Gen
eral Dag Hammarskjold.
What Moscow wants to do is to
render the Secretariat immobile
and unable to shield the fragile,
new nations from the winds of
the cold war.

Mr. Khrushchev is not attack
ing the role of Secretary General
Hammarskjold because the U.N.
is at the point of failure in the
Congo. He is attacking the Sec
retary General because the U.N.
is, to Moscow, showing dangerous
signs of succeeding in the Congo.
MR. K. wants to insure the
U.N.’s failure in the Congo and
by making the office of the Secre
tary General impotent be certain
that the U.N. is not free to help
other nations.

When the charter was drafted
in San Francisco the Soviets felt
they had nothing to fear from the
power of the Secretary General.
The Soviets had a veto over the
Security Council. The General As
sembly was to be only a debating
society, a world town meeting of
the air.

The “science of Marxism,”
which is supposed to enable the
Communists to predict history,
somehow failed them at the U.n!
When Lumumba was Premier, the
Soviets joined the other powers
at the Security Council in voting
unanimously for the U.N. to help
in the Congo. Then when Lu
mumba was removed and the Gen
eral Assembly seated Kasavubu.
there was no way Moscow could
veto the directive to Hammarsk
jold to carry on the U.N. Congo
mission. Even the General As
sembly has successfully asserted
the power to act when the Secur
ity Council is deadlocked.

Thus the Kremlin has found its
Security Council veto insufficient
to immobilize the U.N. The So
viets concluded that the only
means of making the U.N. ade
quately impotent is to get a veto
over the functioning of the Sec
retariat.

THIS IS the purpose of the
clamorous Soviet demand that the
office of Secretary General be dis
solved and that the Secretariat be
put in charge of a committee of
three (a Russian, a Western, and
a neutral), each of whom would
have to agree before the Secre
tariat could carry out any direc
tive given to it by the Security
Council or the General Assembly.
Evidently Mr. Khrushchev is
afraid the United Nations will
succeed in sheltering the new na
tions from outside interference
and is determined to immobilize
the U.N. before it is too late. If
the new Afro-Asian nations truly
measure what he is up to, they
can be decisive in preventing it.

Mr. Khrushchev is not attack
ing the role of Secretary General
Hammarskjold because the U.N.
is at the point of failure in the
Congo. He is attacking the Sec
retary General because the U.N.
is, to Moscow, showing dangerous
signs of succeeding in the Congo.

U.N.’s failure in the Congo and

When the charter was drafted
in San Francisco the Soviets felt
they had nothing to fear from the
power of the Secretary General.
The Soviets had a veto over the
Security Council. The General As

the air.

The “science of Marxism,”
which is supposed to enable the

somehow failed them at the U.n!
When Lumumba was Premier, the
Soviets joined the other powers
at the Security Council in voting
unanimously for the U.N. to help
in the Congo. Then when Lu
mumba was removed and the Gen

there was no way Moscow could
veto the directive to Hammarsk
jold to carry on the U.N. Congo
mission. Even the General As
sembly has successfully asserted
the power to act when the Secur
ity Council is deadlocked.

Thus the Kremlin has found its
Security Council veto insufficient
to immobilize the U.N. The So
viets concluded that the only
means of making the U.N. ade
quately impotent is to get a veto
over the functioning of the Sec
retariat.

THIS IS the purpose of the
clamorous Soviet demand that the
office of Secretary General be dis
solved and that the Secretariat be
put in charge of a committee of
three (a Russian, a Western, and
a neutral), each of whom would
have to agree before the Secre
tariat could carry out any direc
tive given to it by the Security
Council or the General Assembly.
Evidently Mr. Khrushchev is
afraid the United Nations will
succeed in sheltering the new na
tions from outside interference
and is determined to immobilize
the U.N. before it is too late. If
the new Afro-Asian nations truly
measure what he is up to, they
can be decisive in preventing it.

Tlie United Nations is today at
its most critical juncture and
Moscow is throwing rocks on the
track.
The U.N. must either move
ahead to prove that it can be an
effective means to secure the sta
bility and independence of the
new nations. Or it is going to
grind to an impotent stop when
it is most needed.
THE CRUCIAL test is in the
Congo. There under the most ad
verse circumstances--a combina
tion of disunity within the U.N.
and disunity in the Congo—the
United Nations’ ability to shelter
the birth of a new nation is being
tried under fire.
If it can succeed in the Congo
against such despairing odds, the
U.N. will gain such strength and
prestige as will enable it to do
more of the same in other trouble
spots.
Will the U.N. succeed? Not if
the Soviet Union can prevent it
and it is throwing up every possi
ble roadblock.
IT IS NO accident that at the
moment when the United Nations
is beginning to demonstrate its
greatest usefulnes, Premier Khru
shchev is stepping up his fight to
derail the U.N.’s driving engine,
the office of the Secretary Gen
eral Dag Hammarskjold.
