# Press Lacks Self-Restraint, JFK Tells New York Editor
## 
### 
GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (UPD—
President Kennedy feels he has
not had much success in getting
American newspapers to accept
his self-censorship, it was revealed
tonight.
In a letter to the editor and
publisher of Newsday, a Long
Island Daily, the President wrote:
“I have asked the newspaper in
dustry, without much success, to
exercise more self-restraint in
publishing intelligence data help
ful to the enemy.”
HIS LETTER, which will take
up the entire editorial page of to
morrow’s Newsday, was in reply
to a letter from the publisher
which referred to Kennedy’s fre
quent demands on the American
people to sacrifice.
Kennedy answered that among
the sacrifices were the closing of
some military bases, major ef
forts in foreign aid, the Peace
Corps, a tightening up of expense
accounts, higher postal rates and
the halting of “stoppages in our
missiles and space effort.”
“These requests for sacrifice
are being strongly resisted by
some unwilling to pay the price
of national greatness,” the Presi
dent said.
