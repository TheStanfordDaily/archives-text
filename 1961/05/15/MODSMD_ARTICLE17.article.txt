# Indian Nine Tops DSC, Santa Clara
## 
### 
Knocking off the CIBA cham-1
pion USC Trojans and dropping
Santa Clara twice. Stanford's var
sity baseballers managed to pull
themselves out of the cellar and
into fourth place last weekend.
The Indians pulled off (he big-!
gest upset in CIBA play this year
by edging the Trojans 7-5 Friday, j
SC, ranked number one nation-1
ally, needed just one more win to
cop the league title, but had to |
wait until Saturday when they
split a doublehearier with Califor
nia. The Indians went on to stop
the Broncos twice by scores of 9-4
and 5-4 on Saturday.
TOMORROW Coach Dutch Feh
ring’s club will square off against
the San Diego Marines in a non- :
league fray at 3:15 p.m. on the
Sunken Diamond.
The Trojans and Indians bat
lied right down to the wire with
the lead changing hands three
times. John Hurlbut’s big bat and |
a couple of fine throws from cen- i
ter field by Hal Schutzmann made
the difference.
Schutzmann choked off the fi- 1
nal Trojan threat in the ninth as |
he caught a routine fly ball in cen
ter field and then fired a perfect (
peg to catcher Bob Overman just .
nipping the Trojan runner who ;
had tagged up at third. The fleet i,
center fielder pulled off a similar 1 1
double play earlier in the game. ;,
TRIO INDIANS were also in 1 1
trouble in the seventh when the {
Trojans exploded for four' runs to I ’
go ahead 5-4. With men on first I
and second and only one out )'

| Coach Dutch Fehring brought
sophomore Darrell Sutherland in
from the bull pen, and the lanky
righthander struck out the last
two Trojan hitters. Sutherland
was credited with the win al
though he threw only 12 pitches.
Saturday the Cards capitalized
on nine walks and two Santa
j Clara errors to pick up nine runs
jin the first game of 1 lit* double
j header.
j Jim Smith started for Stanford
Sand picked up the win although
he was shaky in the five innings
he worked, allowing nine hits,
iwalking four and striking out
I none.
THE STANFORD attack was
j bolstered by triples off the hats of
i Overman, Schutzmann and Joel
jShulman.
In the aftermath a fine relief
performance by Marv Mecklcn
j berg pulled the Indians out of a
jam in the sixth and preserved
the one-run victory.
The Indians trailed 3-1 going
unto the fifth and hopes of finally
climbing out of the cellar were
j fading. But Lee Moench and Skip
Lawrence started things with a
pair of singles and Hurlhut was
hit by a pitch to load the bases.
Overman then smacked a timely
single to right scoring two and
moving Hurlbut to third. Over
man stole second and went to
third on a throwing error by
catcher Ron Cook which also en
abled Hurlbut to score.
Peppery Mike Magee followed
with a perfect squeeze bunt down
the third base line which scored
Overman with the winning run.
