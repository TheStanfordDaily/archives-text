## 
### 
Seven Stanford history professors have joined 174 other Ameri
can historians in signing a letter to President John F. Kennedy criti
cizing his administration's Cuban policy.
Stanford professors signing the letter were Claude A. Buss, Fred
eric L. Cheyette, Gavin I. Langmuir, James T. C. Liu, Anatole G.

Mazour, Thomas C. Smith, and
Gordon Wright.
The letter criticizes the admin
istration’s attempt “to fabricate
national unanimity in support of
a Cuban policy whose future out
lines remain obscure.”

signed the letter since it was the
one way to counteract movements
in favor of direct intervention in
Cuba.”
Cheyette told the Daily that “I
would have made the letter even
stronger: Kennedy’s Cuba policy
deserves the censure which it is
getting. I am happy, however,
that no extreme policies have fol
lowed the invasion.”
KENNEDY’S suggestion that
the press should exercise self-cen
sorship also came in for criticism
jin the historians’ letter. “The na
tional interest, especially at this
i critical juncture, can only be
1 found in open debate. The idea of
; national interest must not be used
■ as a slogan to smother public de
| bate.”
Langmuir thinks that "the cen
j sorship issue should not be made
so important in newspaper cover-
I age” since it was not the main
| point of the letter.
Cheyette told the Daily that in
; sofar as publicity on the Cuban
j invasion was concerned, “the gov
! eminent must stop feeding false
I information to the public if the
j country is to know where its lead
ers are taking it.”
Cheyette expressed his satisfac
tion that Kennedy has not con
tinued his remarks about self
censorship and that, in fact, he
has backed down on the issue.

THE LETTER also assorts that
“further intervention in Cuba and
a facade of national unity at home
are equally dangerous.”
In the letter to Kennedy the his
torians commented, “You began
your administration on a note of
promise. The United States was
to seek a meeting of minds, to
prevent the test of arms. In less
than a hundred days, in dealing
with Cuba, our government has
in effect fallen back on the old
cliche; The only thing they under
stand is force. To resort to force
is to preclude understanding and
to undermine confidence in this
country’s good faith.”
While criticizing Kennedy’s past
policy, the letter also warns that
further intervention might cause
general war and would certainly
weaken “the position of the United
States in countries determined to
pursue their own development,
free of great-power control.”

happiness with the wording and

Seven Stanford history professors have joined 174 other Ameri
can historians in signing a letter to President John F. Kennedy criti
cizing his administration's Cuban policy.
Stanford professors signing the letter were Claude A. Buss, Fred
eric L. Cheyette, Gavin I. Langmuir, James T. C. Liu, Anatole G.

Mazour, Thomas C. Smith, and
Gordon Wright.
The letter criticizes the admin
istration’s attempt “to fabricate
national unanimity in support of
a Cuban policy whose future out
lines remain obscure.”

signers from men like C. Wright
Mills, who arc pro-Castro. I
signed the letter since it was the
one way to counteract movements
in favor of direct intervention in
Cuba.”
Cheyette told the Daily that “I
would have made the letter even
stronger: Kennedy’s Cuba policy
deserves the censure which it is
getting. I am happy, however,
that no extreme policies have fol
lowed the invasion.”
KENNEDY’S suggestion that
the press should exercise self-cen
sorship also came in for criticism
jin the historians’ letter. “The na
tional interest, especially at this
i critical juncture, can only be
1 found in open debate. The idea of
; national interest must not be used
■ as a slogan to smother public de
| bate.”
Langmuir thinks that "the cen
j sorship issue should not be made
so important in newspaper cover-
I age” since it was not the main
| point of the letter.
Cheyette told the Daily that in
; sofar as publicity on the Cuban
j invasion was concerned, “the gov
! eminent must stop feeding false
I information to the public if the
j country is to know where its lead
ers are taking it.”
Cheyette expressed his satisfac
tion that Kennedy has not con
tinued his remarks about self
censorship and that, in fact, he
has backed down on the issue.

THE LETTER also assorts that
“further intervention in Cuba and
a facade of national unity at home
are equally dangerous.”
In the letter to Kennedy the his
torians commented, “You began
your administration on a note of
promise. The United States was
to seek a meeting of minds, to
prevent the test of arms. In less
than a hundred days, in dealing
with Cuba, our government has
in effect fallen back on the old
cliche; The only thing they under
stand is force. To resort to force
is to preclude understanding and
to undermine confidence in this
country’s good faith.”
While criticizing Kennedy’s past
policy, the letter also warns that
further intervention might cause
general war and would certainly
weaken “the position of the United
