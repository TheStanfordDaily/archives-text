## 
### 
In the shadow of a record

San Jose State’s Dennis Johnson,
five Indian trackmen scored giv
ing Stanford eighth place in a
field of 16 at the West Coast Re
lays at Fresno Saturday.
Most successful of the Stanford
entrants was Ernie Cunliffe, a
graduate who ran unattached and
finished second in the mile with
a time of 4:05.2. His points were
not counted in the Indian total.
CUNIJFFE led throughout the
first three laps, running a 3:02
pace, but was overtaken in the
backstretch by Jim Grelle, for
merly of Oregon, who won in
4:02.5.
Dave Weill, a very promising
sophomore on this year’s track
squad, came through with a 173-
Vst heave in the discus which was
good for third place in the strong
field. Rink Babka won the event
at 180-7%.
Art Batchelder picked up fifth
place points in the javelin with
a toss of 232-9. Batchelder, a jun

24-Va for fifth place. Jerry Win
ters, a familiar face to Card track
fans of last year when he starred

a put of 55-1194.
Highlight of the afternoon’s
competition was the mile relay
where Oregon’s combo composed
of Lewis Powell, Sig Ohlemann,
Keith Forman and Dyrol Burleson
cracked the American record with
a time of 16:29.3. Burleson, who
ran the anchor lap in 4:00.8, also
won the mile in 4:00,2. That was
the first mile double of his life.

hind to win narrowly over Occi
dental’s Doug Smith, who was
caught in an identical 9.4 clock
ing.
USC won the team title with a
total of 76%, Occidental was sec

In the shadow of a record
breaking performance in the four
mile relay and a 9.4 century by
San Jose State’s Dennis Johnson,
five Indian trackmen scored giv
ing Stanford eighth place in a
field of 16 at the West Coast Re
lays at Fresno Saturday.
Most successful of the Stanford
entrants was Ernie Cunliffe, a
graduate who ran unattached and
finished second in the mile with
a time of 4:05.2. His points were
not counted in the Indian total.
CUNIJFFE led throughout the
first three laps, running a 3:02
pace, but was overtaken in the
backstretch by Jim Grelle, for
merly of Oregon, who won in
4:02.5.
Dave Weill, a very promising
sophomore on this year’s track
squad, came through with a 173-
Vst heave in the discus which was
good for third place in the strong
field. Rink Babka won the event
at 180-7%.
Art Batchelder picked up fifth
place points in the javelin with
a toss of 232-9. Batchelder, a jun

ior, was a consistent winner for
the Cards all year.
STANFORD picked up unex
pected points in the broad jump,
as junior Charles Barth leaped
24-Va for fifth place. Jerry Win
ters, a familiar face to Card track
fans of last year when he starred
for Coach Payton Jordan’s squad,
picked up a fifth in the shot with
a put of 55-1194.
Highlight of the afternoon’s
competition was the mile relay
where Oregon’s combo composed
of Lewis Powell, Sig Ohlemann,
Keith Forman and Dyrol Burleson
cracked the American record with
a time of 16:29.3. Burleson, who
ran the anchor lap in 4:00.8, also
won the mile in 4:00,2. That was
the first mile double of his life.
