### 
The will of Mrs. Florence Moore bequeaths $750,000 to the Uni
versity for the construction of a dormitory to be named for her late
husband, Robert S. Moore. Mrs. Moore, who died last July 12, left a
total estate of $14,254,474, according to an inventory filed in San
Mateo County Superior Court.

Fifty thousand dollars was left
to the Stanford Convalescent

Home and the same amount to
the University of California to
establish scholarships for worthy
students.

Mrs. Moore's gift to Stanford
will be applied to the cost of a
group of undergraduate non-fra
ternity residences to be bruit in
the area between The Knoll, May
field Ave. and Junipero Serra
Illvd., said a spokesman for the
development office yesterday.
THE TOTAL cost of the planned
construction will be roughly $l,-
600,000, the spokesman said,
which will be a combination of
gifts and government loans. Mrs.
Mooreâ€™s bequest will account for
more than half of the required $1
million in gift funds.
The intended gift was known to
the University last fall, but until
the will was probated, the funds
were not available. The spokes
man indicated that actual plans
for the development will start
soon to be under way when the
money is in Stanford hands.
The residence halls will be
named after Moore, who was the
founder of the Moore Shipbuild
ing Co. of Oakland and San Fran
cisco. His company built many of
the cargo vessels used in World
War I.
THE RESIDENCE will consist
of a group of buildings, perhaps
divided among both men and wo
men. the spokesman said.
Mrs. Moore was an Atherton
resident and died at the age of 95.
She previously made several gifts
to the University, including $1
million in 1955, which went to
ward the girls dorm which bears
her name and was the largest gift
ever made by a living person to
a university.
THE REMAINDER of the over
$l4 million estate went to other
charities, friends and relatives.
Mrs. Moore was childless, so the
bulk of the estate will bo shared
by her niece,, and nephews.
