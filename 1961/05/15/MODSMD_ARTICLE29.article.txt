shortly after noon, stoned it and
then followed it out of town and
tossed an incendiary bomb
through an open window when it
stopped for repairs.
Three persons, all members of

were injured from smoke inhala

completely destroyed by fire.
A white man, identified as

was hospitalized when two or
three white persons jumped him
as he attempted to walk Into the
terminal cafe with four or five
Negroes.
