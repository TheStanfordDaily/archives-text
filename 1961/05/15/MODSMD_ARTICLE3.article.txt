# Special ST&T Talk to Discuss Choosing Major
## 
### 
Some of the problems of choos
ing a major should be more easily
solved as a result of the Stanford
Today and Tomorrow Special Ma
jors Program scheduled for this
week.

A series of 14 panel discussions
will bo held in various Wilbur
lounges and in the Branner lobby
tomorrow night and Wednesday
night to provide comparative in
formation on the many different
fields of major which arc avail
able.

EACH SEMINAR will cover
two or more closely related fields,
and the panelists chosen are both
outstanding in their departments,
and able to compare and contrast
(heir field with others. The pro
fessors will outline briefly the op
portunities in their fields; what
specifically it entails to major in
the subject; fall courses aimed
especially at sophomores; honors
programs, etc.
They will encourage questions
from the floor.
Some of the participating fac
ulty members are Gordon Wright,
executive head of the History De
partment; J. L. Mofhershead Jr.,
professor of Philosophy; and R.
H. Alway, Dean of the Stanford
Medical School, on Tuesday.
FOB WEDNESDAY, a few of
the speakers listed are Mathe
matics professor H. M. Bacon,
Kurt Steiner of the Political Sci
ence Department, W. H. Stone, as
sociate professor of English, and
Football Coach Jack Curtice.
The program was arranged by
ST and T in answer to requests
from both undergraduates and
profesors. By introducing these
men, most of whom freshmen
have had no opportunity to meet
earlier, the Majors Program
wishes to encourage still unde
clared students to arrange later
private conferences with men re
ally “in the know,” thereby sup
plementing the present pre-major
advisory system.
