With totals still incomplete, re
sults of the Con Home solicita
tions appear very favorable, re
port spokesmen for the off and
on-campus solicitations, Steve
Burks and Fred McLane.
“A complete success beyond our
expectations and beyond our
hopes at first,” Burks described
the off-campus showing. The fi
nal totals should reach about
$7BOO the chairman estimated.
Burks wished to express special
thanks to the freshmen who made
the high total possible.
Figures on on-campus solicita
tion are still coming in and pres
ent figures are all approximate,
McLane explained, but the final
total should l>e about $lOOO. Indi
vidual living groups wtih high to

Eucalypto in Lagunita, $36; Ru
