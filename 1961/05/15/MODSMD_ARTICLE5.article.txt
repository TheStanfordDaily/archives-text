i Indian graduate student in petro
i leum engineering, is the I-Club’s
| new president.
As head of Stanford’s only or
ganization representing all for

j can students an opportunity to

club. Mathai has proposed an ex
j tensive social program for next
I year, including, dinners, ex-
I changes, movies, and talks by
prominent foreign visitors. High
lights of the I-Club’s social events
will be an “International Ball”
during full quarter, attended by

all the heads of diplomatib mis
sions in California, and an “Inter
national Dinner” during winter
quarter.
He also wants to put a foreign
representative in LASSU. A for
eign student in Legislature, he ex
plains, will not only be advantage
ous for the foreign students; it
will also Introduce a foreign view
point into LASSU, giving its rep
resentatives a broader outlook.
MATHAI polled 95 votes to de
feat his opponent, Touradj Amir
jsoleymani, who received 47 votes.
Fred Aw was elected vice presi
dent with 65 votes over Hunt Pea
cock with 59.

dents, and 30 per cent of the Am
erican members of tho I-Cluh
voted, out of a total membership
of 600 foreign students and 100

i Indian graduate student in petro
i leum engineering, is the I-Club’s
| new president.
As head of Stanford’s only or
ganization representing all for
eign students, Mathai wants to
“make the I-Club the top social
organization of the campus ... a
position it rightly deserves.’’
THE PURPOSE of the club, ho
says, is to give foreign and Ameri
j can students an opportunity to
meet one another. Most of the 600
foreign students at Stanford are
engaged in graduate studies and
live off campus, giving them little
other opportunity to fraternize
with American students, lie re
ported.
To stimulate interest in the
club. Mathai has proposed an ex
j tensive social program for next
I year, including, dinners, ex-
I changes, movies, and talks by
prominent foreign visitors. High
lights of the I-Club’s social events
will be an “International Ball”
during full quarter, attended by

all the heads of diplomatib mis
sions in California, and an “Inter
national Dinner” during winter
quarter.
He also wants to put a foreign
representative in LASSU. A for
eign student in Legislature, he ex
plains, will not only be advantage
ous for the foreign students; it
will also Introduce a foreign view
point into LASSU, giving its rep
resentatives a broader outlook.
MATHAI polled 95 votes to de
feat his opponent, Touradj Amir
jsoleymani, who received 47 votes.
Fred Aw was elected vice presi
dent with 65 votes over Hunt Pea
cock with 59.
The proposed amendment to the
I-Club constitution was rejected,
with 68 voting “yes” and 67 “no.”
A two-thirds majority would have
been necessary for adoption of the
amendment.
Twenty-five of the foreign stu
dents, and 30 per cent of the Am
erican members of tho I-Cluh
voted, out of a total membership
of 600 foreign students and 100
Americans.
