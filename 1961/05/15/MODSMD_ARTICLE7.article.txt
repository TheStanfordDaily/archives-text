Dr. Carl B. Spaeth, dean of the Stanford Law School, is under
consideration by President Kennedy for the post of Assistant Secre
tary of State for Inter-American Affairs, according to a report Friday
by the Associated Press. Another possibility for the post, according
to the Herald Tribune News Service, is Dr. Clark Kerr, president of

the University of California.
According to Spaeth, however,
there is “nothing to” the AP
"rumor.” “I have not been ap
proached about that job, although
I have been on two others,” he
said. He refused further com
ment.
SPAETH, 54, was general coun

Inter - American Committee for
Political Defense.
In 1945-46 he served as special
assistant to the Assistant Secre
tary of State for Inter-American
Affairs.
At the same time Kerr said,
"I have had no formal offer,
hence I have not accepted any
thing. I have had discussions with

the Administration regarding pos
sible assignments, beginning last
November, but I have had no for
mal offers, except for a part-time
consultative position on a labor
management advisory commit
tee.”
LAST DECEMBER Kerr turned
down the post of Secretary of
Labor in the Kennedy Adminis
tration.
According to reports from
Washington, Kennedy has for a
long time been seeking the proper
place in his administration for
Kerr.
In 1958 Kerr became president
of UC, succeeding Dr. Robert Gor
don Sproul. Before that he was

industrial relations for a time.
Kerr has also served on the War
Labor Board and the Wage Stabi
