# Religious Pressure Enters Chappie Row
## Clerics Blast 'Layboy'; Religion the Issue-Efron 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
Accusations of religious pressure and official denials added yes
terday to campus furor over Friday's suspension by Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler of the Chaparral and its editor Brad
Efron for the rest of the academic year.

When questioned, Executive As
sistant to the President Frederic
O. Glover stated. "It is true that
Father John P. Tierney (of St.
Anne’s Catholic Church in Palo
Alto) did call representing Arch
bishop John J. Mitty and objected
to the issue, but our decision had
nothing to do with him.’’ Arch
bishop Mitty heads the archdio
cese of San Francisco.
Efron, however, feels that the
religious issue was the biggest ob
jection to the magazine. He told
the Daily, "Religious objections
are (ho only reason I can imagine
I’ve been suspended, and the mag
azine suspended, because the rest
of the magazine was not much
different from usual.”
The particular article under fire
was the one entitled “The Ass and
the Cuckcold.” University sources
label the article “a burlesque of
the Incarnation, or Virgin Birth.”
WINBIGLER also denied that
outside pressures were in any
way responsible for his decision.
He said that he talked to all but
two of the members of the Com
mittee on Student Affairs and
Services before reaching a deci
sion, and the consensus was
strong support for the action
which he took individually.
Yesterday morning, students
who attended masses at St. Anne’s
reported that a statement was
made calling for student opinion
against the Chappie. It was ex
plained that Archbishop Mitty is
objecting to what was termed “a
direct attack on religious beliefs.”
REV. ROBERT MINTO of Me
morial Church, when asked for
his opinion on the Playboy par
ody, stated. “It showed poor judg
ment and the University had a
perfect right in taking this ac
tion.” He had earlier mentioned
the Chappie in his sermon.
Rev. Malcolm McAfee, Stanford
Presbyterian chaplain told the
! Daily last night that the Stanford
! Ecumenical Council will hold its
usual meeting on Wednesday
noon and at that time will release
a statement. The group represents
seven protestant denominations.
Student body president Larry
Roysc, who did not attend the
Legislature meeting last week,
1 “did favor the censure motion, and
I thought if it passed it would have
1 l>een satisfactory and probably
i would have prevented Efron’s be
j ing kicked out of school.”
| Typical comment on the suspen
sion by student leaders was that
I some action was necessary, but
ithe action taken was too strong.
ASSU President-elect Bob Sayler
! commented. “The magazine is in
bad taste —out of bounds. I ap
prove of the University’s action in
I disassociating itself from the
1 magazine and refusing to condone
the issue by suspending the maga
zine’s publication, but Efron’s
punishment is too strong . . . (the
University) went 100 far in choos
ing Efron as a scapegoat,”
Winbigler. however, who would
I have preferred direct student ac
' tion, nevertheless feels that the
j suspension of both editor and
magazine represent a minimum of
I censure. He said, “I waited to
i give duly constituted student ag
encies a chance to act on it and
unfortunately they did not. The
only choice in my mind was
whether this was enough or not.”
SEVERAL PETITIONS to pro
test the suspension and the cen
sorship involved in such action
are being circulated among the
students. Among those support
| ing the petitions are Nancy Han
| na, Jane Chrisman and Pat Black
of Lag and Tom Cover of Cro
! thers Memorial.
As campus opinion jelled on
i both sides of the issue, the follow
i ing comment was posted at the
Flicks last night; “I only regret
that I have but one life to give to
the PACE Program.—The Old
Boy.”
