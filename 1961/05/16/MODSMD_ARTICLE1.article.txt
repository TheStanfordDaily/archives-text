## 
### 
Daily Managing Editor Jerry Rankin was presented yesterday
with the first place award in the William Randolph Hearst Founda
tions Awards contest. His award was presented him yesterday in
Washington by President John F. Kennedy.
As top national winner, Rankin's award carries with it S2OOO for

himself and $3OOO for the Univer
sity Department of Communica
tion and Journalism.
Rankin met with Kennedy at 5
p.m. yesterday, EDT, for about 15
minutes. Also present were presi
dential press secretary Pierre Sal
inger and Randolph A. Hearst,
president of Hearst Consolidated
Publications.
On Rankin’s schedule today is
lunch with California Sen. Claire
Engle and flight to New York
City to tape a 6-minute segment
of the NBC-TV “Today” show, to
bo broadcast Wednesday morning.
He will appear on the “What’s
My Line?” TV show live Thurs
day night. He left Stanford last
Saturday and will return this
weekend.

The Hearst contest began last
November and has progressed by
monthly stages. Rankin’s total
points for the entire contest, in-

eluding each month’s competition
was the greatest of any contest
ant.

He won a first place in I he Jan
uary contest for editorial writing
for an editorial on integration at
the University of Georgia. All the
work he submitted was published
in the Daily.
In the November contest, for
news writing, Rankin placed
eighth with a story on Big Game
stunts. A LASSU article got him
12th place in the December com
petition.
He held the contest lead from
January on, although he didn’t
enter the February contest for
sports writing. He placed eleventh
in the March news story competi
tion, and although he entered the
April feature story contest, didn't
place.
Stanford entrants placed third
in over-all University scoring
though there are only 20 upper
division journalism majors on the
Farm. The first and second place
schools, the Universities of Kan
sas and Washington have large
journalism schools. Washington
edged Stanford out of second
place by only a few points.
Helping Rankin to gain third
spot for Stanford were Daily
writers Mary Lou McKinley, who
entered a news story in the No
vember- contest, and Ron Rapo
port who placed fourth in the
February sports writing competi
tion.
