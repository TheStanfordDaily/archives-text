# Buckley Hits Moralistic Rhetoric'
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
Liberal devotion to “moralistic
rhetoric” is harming our national
security, conservative William F.
Buckley charged last night. In a
speech attacking the liberal atti
tudes which he said have been
shaping our national policy, Buck
ley pointed out four areas which
he believes such attitudes have
effected.
“OUR national security has been
reduced in effectiveness by an in
tellectual distrust of the power of
force,” Buckley stated. This hesi
tation has meant, he said, that we
have been “deprived of an enor
mous leverage in behalf of na
tional security and peace.”
Buckley stressed a distinction
between a desire for peace, and
pacifism. “All civilized men of
the Western tradition must des
pise pacifism,” he assorted, claim
ing that the conditions under
which peace is thinkable for the
Westerner do not now exist and
that only bold and purposeful ac
tion will bring about those condi
tions.

THE right-wing editor of the
National Review next accused the
liberal attitude toward internal
security of effecting the national
security. He named Alger Hiss
and the Rosenborgs, among oth
ers, as examples of necessity for
greater internal security and
stated, “The continual advantage
of selective security ... is in some
measure denied to us on account
of the abstractions of liberalism.”

Buckley’s third point was that
national security is deeply influ
enced by liberalism’s “moralistic
rhetoric.” He said that the ex
pressed ideal of self-determination
for nations greatly handicaps our
national policy.

BUCKLEY also advocated the
development of a nuclear arsenal
as crucial to national security. He
compared atomic power to fire,
saying that possible dangers must
not prevent exploitation of poten
tial good. This is the power, he
said, “by which the free peoples
of Europe have been kept free.”
As his fifth and final point,
Buckley offered the following
statement: “The ultimate mean
ing of liberalism may lender to
tally irrelevant a concern for the
national security.”
Buckley spoke before a near
capacity crowd in Memorial Audi
torium, and the questions and an
swers both drew applause.

speech attacking the liberal atti
tudes which he said have been
shaping our national policy, Buck
ley pointed out four areas which
he believes such attitudes have
effected.
“OUR national security has been
reduced in effectiveness by an in
tellectual distrust of the power of
force,” Buckley stated. This hesi
tation has meant, he said, that we
have been “deprived of an enor
mous leverage in behalf of na
tional security and peace.”
Buckley stressed a distinction
between a desire for peace, and
pacifism. “All civilized men of
the Western tradition must des
pise pacifism,” he assorted, claim
ing that the conditions under
which peace is thinkable for the
Westerner do not now exist and
that only bold and purposeful ac
tion will bring about those condi
tions.

THE right-wing editor of the
National Review next accused the
liberal attitude toward internal
security of effecting the national
security. He named Alger Hiss
and the Rosenborgs, among oth
ers, as examples of necessity for
greater internal security and
stated, “The continual advantage
of selective security ... is in some
measure denied to us on account
of the abstractions of liberalism.”

Buckley’s third point was that
national security is deeply influ
enced by liberalism’s “moralistic
rhetoric.” He said that the ex
pressed ideal of self-determination
for nations greatly handicaps our
national policy.

BUCKLEY also advocated the
development of a nuclear arsenal
as crucial to national security. He
compared atomic power to fire,
saying that possible dangers must
not prevent exploitation of poten
tial good. This is the power, he
said, “by which the free peoples
of Europe have been kept free.”
As his fifth and final point,
Buckley offered the following
statement: “The ultimate mean
ing of liberalism may lender to
tally irrelevant a concern for the
national security.”
Buckley spoke before a near
capacity crowd in Memorial Audi
torium, and the questions and an
swers both drew applause.
