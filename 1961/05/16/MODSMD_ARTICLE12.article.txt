# Chappie Requires Royse Action
## 
### 
The cry of freedom of conscience has once again been raised by
those who feel that the University acted unjustly in its suspension of
the Chaparral and its editor, Brad Efron, until next fall. In petitions,
personal pleas, and letters to the editor, these students claim the Ad
ministration has stifled free thought for the PACE fund-raising cam
paign. They believe the Old Boy has been sacrificed for a quarter to
keep the University's skirts clean so that it can continue to flirt with
millionaires. Yet a look at the history of the Chaparral and its editors
will show that the University has acted no differently in handling
Mr. Efron than it has in handling wayward Chaparral editors since
the magazine was founded. President Ray Lyman Wilbur always
used to engage in what he termed "drowning an editor." When he
was president, no organized fund-raising campaign existed at Stan
ford; he simply acted when an editor stepped over the bounds of
good taste.

Some of the Administration's critics have stated that the Uni
versity has no right to determine what is good taste. We believe
differently. Clearly, the Chappie editor stepped into the realm of
crudity. The magazine contains stories which are both objectionable
on moral and religious grounds, not only to alumni, school children,
or parents, but also to a large portion of the student body. For those
students who want to read this type of literature, we suggest the
corner newsstand where it can be readily purchased. But literature
of such low standards as the May issue of the Chappie should not be
distributed as the official Stanford University humor magazine. As
Dean H. Donald Winbigler has said in explaining the intelligent Uni
versity policy, "The University justifiably expects and requires that
any Stanford publication meets substantially higher standards in this
respect than the minimum allowed in pulp magazines." Presumably,
those who disagree with this statement would like ASSU publica
tions to meet only minimum legal standards. Either this be true, or
they fear that students will no longer be free to criticize the Univer
sity. Again history has proven this latter assumption correct. The
Daily, both this spring and last, has taken strong issue with the Ad
ministration over the Hoover Manifesto and the Student Health Serv
ice. In both cases the Daily has not been subject to either the threat
of discipline or discipline itself. We suggest that those who would
invoke the freedom of conscience argument over the May Chaparral
would do well to save their call for a cause which really deserves
student concern.

The real misfortune of the Dean's decision was that it was not a
student decision. It should have been. The Legislature in its Thurs
day night session once again proved its in ineffectiveness. True, it
is difficult for such a group to legislate a collective policy which
might be labeled prudish. Yet, in the absence of a strong Publica
tions Board, we believe they should have affirmed the censure. Their
failure to act courageously as a policy-making body is a black spot
on their record.

The answer in the future, however, does not rely with Legisla
ture, but with an improved Publications Board. At the present this
Board is composed of the editor and business manager of each stu
dent publication, two representatives of the Legislature, and a jour
nalism faculty member. This body should be strengthened by add
ing at least one more Legislature member, an additional non
journalistic faculty member and at least one alumni member with
a journalistic background. Such a board would be sensitive enough
to public opinion without being controlled by it. The publications
would be safeguarded against the petty fluctuations of campus poli
tics, which would be recorded in a wholly political body such as
Legislature. Pre-censorship should not be the function of the Board,
although discussion of upcoming issues would be encouraged. How
ever, this board should take action against editors and publications.
This action could range anywhere from a warning to recommending
suspension. Editors would abide by decisions that originated from a
semi-professional board which subjects itself to a minimum of politi
cal pressure.

Dean Winbigler has stated the Chaparral will not resume publi
cation until "there will be in the future an adequate exercise of stu
dent responsibility for the publication." Here is a mandate for ASSU
President Larry Royse. In the few weeks left, there is still time for
the President to initiate a policy which would make possible the re
turn of the Chaparral next fall.

dent responsibility for the publication." Here is a mandate for ASSU
President Larry Royse. In the few weeks left, there is still time for
the President to initiate a policy which would make possible the re
turn of the Chaparral next fall.
The cry of freedom of conscience has once again been raised by
those who feel that the University acted unjustly in its suspension of
the Chaparral and its editor, Brad Efron, until next fall. In petitions,
personal pleas, and letters to the editor, these students claim the Ad
ministration has stifled free thought for the PACE fund-raising cam
paign. They believe the Old Boy has been sacrificed for a quarter to
keep the University's skirts clean so that it can continue to flirt with
millionaires. Yet a look at the history of the Chaparral and its editors
will show that the University has acted no differently in handling
Mr. Efron than it has in handling wayward Chaparral editors since
the magazine was founded. President Ray Lyman Wilbur always
used to engage in what he termed "drowning an editor." When he
was president, no organized fund-raising campaign existed at Stan
ford; he simply acted when an editor stepped over the bounds of
good taste.

Some of the Administration's critics have stated that the Uni
versity has no right to determine what is good taste. We believe
differently. Clearly, the Chappie editor stepped into the realm of
crudity. The magazine contains stories which are both objectionable
on moral and religious grounds, not only to alumni, school children,
or parents, but also to a large portion of the student body. For those
students who want to read this type of literature, we suggest the
corner newsstand where it can be readily purchased. But literature
of such low standards as the May issue of the Chappie should not be
distributed as the official Stanford University humor magazine. As
Dean H. Donald Winbigler has said in explaining the intelligent Uni
versity policy, "The University justifiably expects and requires that
any Stanford publication meets substantially higher standards in this
respect than the minimum allowed in pulp magazines." Presumably,
those who disagree with this statement would like ASSU publica
tions to meet only minimum legal standards. Either this be true, or
they fear that students will no longer be free to criticize the Univer
sity. Again history has proven this latter assumption correct. The
Daily, both this spring and last, has taken strong issue with the Ad
ministration over the Hoover Manifesto and the Student Health Serv
ice. In both cases the Daily has not been subject to either the threat
of discipline or discipline itself. We suggest that those who would
invoke the freedom of conscience argument over the May Chaparral
would do well to save their call for a cause which really deserves
student concern.

The real misfortune of the Dean's decision was that it was not a
student decision. It should have been. The Legislature in its Thurs
day night session once again proved its in ineffectiveness. True, it
is difficult for such a group to legislate a collective policy which
might be labeled prudish. Yet, in the absence of a strong Publica
tions Board, we believe they should have affirmed the censure. Their
failure to act courageously as a policy-making body is a black spot
on their record.

The answer in the future, however, does not rely with Legisla
ture, but with an improved Publications Board. At the present this
Board is composed of the editor and business manager of each stu
dent publication, two representatives of the Legislature, and a jour
nalism faculty member. This body should be strengthened by add
ing at least one more Legislature member, an additional non
journalistic faculty member and at least one alumni member with
a journalistic background. Such a board would be sensitive enough
to public opinion without being controlled by it. The publications
would be safeguarded against the petty fluctuations of campus poli
tics, which would be recorded in a wholly political body such as
Legislature. Pre-censorship should not be the function of the Board,
although discussion of upcoming issues would be encouraged. How
ever, this board should take action against editors and publications.
This action could range anywhere from a warning to recommending
suspension. Editors would abide by decisions that originated from a
semi-professional board which subjects itself to a minimum of politi
cal pressure.
