Baran and Sweezy

Prof. E. S. Shaw’s call for open
and vigorous political discussion
at Stanford, and in particular for
more debate over American pol
icy toward Cuba, is most gratify
ing. The absence of organized or
vocal support for American pol
icy, he writes, “frustrates the
democratic process of reaching
sound judgments on public issues,
and it belies the intellectual vigor
of the University community.’’
He himself then goes on to con
cede that American policy toward
Cuba “has taken many a wrong
turn —before, during, and after
Batista.” and that if a similar pol
icy is followed toward the rest of
Latin America “the results must
be catastrophic for both Latin
America and ourselves.” That is
exactly what the critics of Ameri
can policy, among whom we have
the honor to be singled out by
Jrof. Shaw, have been saying.
Can it be that the absence, in
campus debate, or for that matter
on the national scene, of intellec
tually respectable support for this
policy arises from the simple fact
that it is insupportable? Prof.
Shaw’s own letter certainly sug
gests this hypothesis.
A tragic aspect of American
policy toward Cuba, Prof. Shaw
says, “is that it has given Castro
occasion for stigmatizing this
country as the foe of social and
economic reform in Latin Amer
ica.” Well, hasn’t this country
been for many years now the foe
of social and economic reform,
not only in Latin America but all
over the globe? What about Iran
and Guatemala, two countries in
which reform - minded govern
ments enjoying massive popular
support were overthrown by the
CIA? What is the situation with
regard to social and economic re
form in South Korea and South
Vietnam, in Pakistan and in Thai
land, in the Philippines and in
Formosa, where American policy
has long ruled supreme? Is the
long record of implacable opposi
tion to economic and social re
form on the part of the United
States government, and of its un
swerving support for oppressive,
exploitative, and corrupt regimes
everywhere the result of acciden
tal “wrong turns,” or could there
perhaps be some doper reason?
We have tried to analyze this
problem and to answer htis qeus
tion, in our writings as well as
in open debate on and off the
campus. Prof. Shaw by implica
tion dismisses our views as mere

“socialist dogma,” and seeks to
discredit them because they hap
pen also to be held by the gov
ernment of the USSR. Is this good
enough for a serious social scien
tist who seeks to promote the
search for “sound judgments on
public issues?”
Prof. Shaw dissents from the
view that the Marshall Plan was
a measure for shoring up capital
ist ruling classes both here and
abroad. We wonder whether he
can really be serious. If the pri
mary purpose of the Marshall
Plan was not to bolster capitalist
regimes against the “threat” of
socialism, if its objectives were to
relieve human suffering and to
promote economic and social de
velopment, why were the billions
of dollars involved not directed to
the poorest instead of the richest
countries in the world? And if it
is not fear of the rising socialist
movement that governs American
policy towards other countries,
why have there since been no
Marshall Plans for those coun
tries in Asia, Africa, and Latin
America where there seemed to
be no immediate revolutionary
"danger?”

It offends Prof. Shaw’s “color
sense” to differentiate between
the aid given by socialist conn

tries to underdeveloped countries
in order to assist their develop
ment, and the aid given by the
United States to reactionary gov
ernments in order to help them
to light off social revolutions.
How does he feel about differen
tiating between the supply of
arms to Castro on the part of
socialist countries to help him
fend off a counterrevolutionary
invasion and the supply of arms
to former Batista-men by the
CIA in order to help them to es
tablish a counterrevolutionary re
gime in Cuba? We must submit
that in this case there is no dan
ger of offending Prof. Shaw’s
“color-sense”; failure to make the !
distinction would indicate total .
color-blindness.
Like many Americans, Prof.
Shaw resents the view, which we
have certainly expressed on many
occasions, that the United States,
under its present social structure,
is an imperialist country. The
problem is, however, not who
holds that view and who does not,
nor is it whether it is popular or
not. The problem is whether it
is true. If Prof. Shaw has serious
arguments to urge aaginst it, we
would be delighted to debate the
subject with him, or with Whom
ever he may wish to nominate,
at any suitable time and place.
Throughout his letter, Prof.
Shaw asserts or implies that we
are spokesmen for the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee or connected
with “popular fronts” to which
we provide “intellectual leader
ship.” Let us be quite explicit.
We joined the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee because we agree with
its objectives; neither of us
speaks, officially or unofficially,
for the committee, or for that
matter, for any other organiza
tion. We have never made any
secret of our desire to advance
and develop the ideas of Marxism
and socialism in this country and
everywhere else. We make no
claim, however, to intellectual
leadership of any popular front,
in fact we do not even know what
the term means as applied to the
United States today.
What we are trying to do in the
context of the Cuba crisis is pre
cisely what Prof. Shaw accuses
us of treating as an impossibility,
namely, to influence American
public opinion to bring pressure
on the administration in Washing
ton to cease its policy of brink
manship and to adopt a new atti
tude toward world affairs and
Cuba in particular. And while we
are certainly not overly sanguine
about the prospects for success,
it is not true, as Prof. Shaw as
serts, that in our last analysis
“the United States can have no
correct policy toward Cuba.” Our
conviction that this policy cannot
be simply regarded as an acciden
tal assortment of “wrong turns”
does not mean that we believe it
to be fatalistically predetermined.
An enlightened administration
serving the true interests of the
American people could resume
normal diplomatic and economic
relations with Cuba, could relin
guish the Guantanamo base a
symbol of American imperialism
in the Caribbean—and could let
Cuba work out its own destiny as
an independent, sovereign and
socialist—nation.

Protests Movie
I would like to protest the
showing of “The Seventh Seal”
at the flicks on Sunday. On Fri
day of last week, the Chaparral
was suspended from further pub
lication this year for alleged sac
rilege, i.e.: burlesqueing the Im
maculate Conception. Two days

later, the Sunday night flicks pre
sented Bergman’s celebrated
movie. Two of the actors played
the part of man and wife who
were named Joseph and Mary,
respectively. The husband made
several allusions to his belief that
his son was God-like. In this}
movie, the actor-husband, who |
was a jongleur, took place in a
skit in which he wore the cuck
old's horns. Can Bergman make
this burlesque for the sake of
art while the Chaparral must re
frain from such sacrilege for the
sake of PACE?

New Old Boy
Perhaps the answer to Chap
pie’s and Stanford’s problem is,
to make Dean Winbigler the |
new Old Boy. This alone could i
insure the proper censorship |
which is necessary to our all-1
important PACE program. The I
move to install the Dean would!
be a master of parody, far better
than the controversial Mr. Efron
or his immediate predecessor. His
"Statement on the removal of
Editor’ from Stanford,” a short
prose work wljich must have been
poetry to the ears of the little old
ladies in Palo Alto, is a wonder
fully subtle satire of Fundamen
tal Standard. I understand that
its rib-tickling ramifications also
run to Stanford’s distinguished
motto, though I have been
strangely unable to find some
one who can translate the Ger
man. At any rate, though the
Dean would probably prefer his
present relative obscurity, I pre
dict that America’s great free
press will carry word of his tal
ents the length and breadth of
the land. Let us make use of his
new-found prominence to bring
ever-increasing fame to one of
the world’s great universities. Re
quest, petition, gently suggest
(but please, please do not dem
onstrate) —Winbigler for old boy.
HOWARD BELOVE
An open postscript to the Dean:
In my letter, strong criticism
is implied, but nothing more. I
object to a scapegoat being cho
sen, though this is the “editors’
burden” and Mr. Efron has car
ried it manfully. I also feel that
it is the very cases which the
administration might least like
to see in student hands and might
at least likely to be satisfied with
the decision reached which must
determine whether the type of
student machinery embodied in
our Fundamental Standard and
elsewhere has, ultimatley, any
meaning at all. Strange as it may
seem, Dean, it is freedom which
is at issue. Not necessarily free
dom to publish objectionable lit
erature, but freedom for student
reaction and responsibility. If the
Fundamental Standard means
anything, it is this.

Keep Quiet
Sunday afternoon the court
yardofLagunit a turned into a
movie location for a PACE pro
paganda film. In a university
which is planned so that students
study in their rooms, we sud
denly foun d ourselves in the
midst of a songest. Wo didn’t

mind being asked to move out
for a day to make room for the
kick-off of the PACE Campaign,
but this is too much. The byword
of this “great” unlversity—until
we raise our $75 million seems
to be: Stop studying, keep quiet
(the Chappie included) and smile
for the publicity men,
