# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION
## 
### Ken Dery 
The day was Saturday, May 6. and Stanford’s undefeated golf
team had its streak of eight straight dual matches on the tine. With
the final foursome having but one hole to go, the Cards were in big
trouble.
Coach Bud Finger, a top-notch golfer himself and a former Stan
ford captain, was obviously nervous.
“I KNEW we were in trouble,” related the Coach. “If Dave Munro
wins the hole then we lie the match.” Our only way to win it out
right is for Steve Smith to beat UCLA’s Cliff Davis. With these
facts in mind I walked out to the 18th tee,
“To be honest with you, I feel that Smith is one of the best pres
sure players in the country. I put it straight to him and let him know
what he had to do for us to win.”

The now famous description
began to unfold. Davis teed off
first and pulled his drive slightly
to the left. Smith, a fine competi
tor. drilled one about 260 down the
middle of the fairway on the
tough 430-yard par four hole.
TO LISTEN to an excited and
happy Bud Finger continue the
tale: “Davis is a local hoy, from
Menlo Park and he knows the
course well. But it is a rainy and
windy day and he needs a very
straight shot to the green to avoid
this tree which is about 120 yards
short of the green. He went after
the flag with a four wood, off of
a downhill lie. and faded it badly
to the right. The ball was headed
out-of-bounds and I felt pretty
good for it looked like we would
pull out of the match alright.
“But the ball hit a springy
branch of a tree which was itself

out-of-bounds. It’s hard to believe, but the ball actually came straight j
back and remained in play.”
Smith hit his five iron shot up there pretty good to the elevated !
green, but the combination of the wind and a slight fade flipped the j
ball into the right-hand trap. The white pellet buried itself in the j
wet saiTtl.
FINGER was worried now—almost as if the match was not over,
and he was going through the agony for the very first time. He
continued, "Davis, who was the California State Junior Champion
in 1959 had an easy pitch shot home, but for some reason he stubbed
it and got himself into real trouble. Now he had to go over a trap
and under a menacing tree to get on the green. He made a real fine
shot though, and the ball ended up about 35 feet from the cup, just
off the edge of the putting surface.
“Smith, pulled a tremendous shot o> t of the bag from his buried
lie. He hit the pin and the ball dropped six feet from the cup. Things
looked bright again, for although Dave Munro had failed to get his
par to assure us a tie, we were now in relatively easy position to I
close out the match anyway.
“Steve came over to me and was obviously feeling pretty good, I
for his opponent lay just off the green in four while Steve was just
six feet away in three. The logical ending saw both men two putting
and Stanford winning the match.
“BFT WOULDN'T you just know it—Davis rolled it in for his
five. There it was—a six foot pressure putt. If Smith misses we
lose 15-12. If he knocks it in we win 141i-12‘s.”
What Smith did is history. Stanford today possesses a dual meet
record of eleven straight victories as this weekend’s AAWU Cham
pionship approaches.

Smith has had help

To attain a record such as this there has to be more than just
Steve Smith. And there is. In fact, Smith has not even been playing
number one.
SKNIOR KKNT WINTON and junior Bill Parish have been alter
nating in the top spot, and each has outstanding credentials. Winton
won the California State Fair Tourney last year beating Vorn Calli
son. Callison is the present National Public Links champion and
California State champ. Kent has been a consistent performer here
for three years. Parish has gone as well as 67 on the exacting Stan
ford layout, and this year he and pro Tommy Jacobs teamed to
finish third in Bing Crosby’s Pro-Amateur Tournament.
Smith, number three on the now-frozen ladder, just won the all
university championship. He is also the Wisconsin State champion
and last summer was runner up in the NCAA championship, losing
on the final hole to defending titleholder Dick Crawford of Houston.
But. perhaps Steve’s most noteworthy triumph is a 4-3 decision over
the world’s top amateur Jack Nicklaus. The match came in last sum
mer’s NCAA Tourney.
Playing in the number four slot is Bill Welch. Bill is just a
sophomore and could develop into one of the real good ones.
SKNIOIi PHIL UNDKRWOOD and sophomore Dave Munro have
been playing in the fifth and sixth spots respectively. Underwood
fashioned the lowest competitive round on the squad this season with
his 66 against San Jose State on the San Jose course. Munro accord
ing to Finger “should be a threat next year.’’
Add to this list Ralph Marron, a long hitter who worked all the
way up the ladder to where he actually was ranked sixth; Gappy
Hurst, the diminutive but beautifully coordinated sophomore, and
some of the members of the undefeated freshman team and you see
the strength of Stanford golf.
Speaking of the freshmen—the top six are Bill Sechrest, Kim
Corbin, Jim Rheim, Jeff Johnson, Jerry Hanweck and Robert Sherrer.
Watch out for Hanweck. He holds the Desert Inn course record along
with pro Art Wall with a torrid 65.

But. perhaps Steve’s most noteworthy triumph is a 4-3 decision over
the world’s top amateur Jack Nicklaus. The match came in last sum
mer’s NCAA Tourney.
Playing in the number four slot is Bill Welch. Bill is just a
sophomore and could develop into one of the real good ones.
SKNIOIi PHIL UNDKRWOOD and sophomore Dave Munro have
been playing in the fifth and sixth spots respectively. Underwood
fashioned the lowest competitive round on the squad this season with
his 66 against San Jose State on the San Jose course. Munro accord
ing to Finger “should be a threat next year.’’
Add to this list Ralph Marron, a long hitter who worked all the
way up the ladder to where he actually was ranked sixth; Gappy
Hurst, the diminutive but beautifully coordinated sophomore, and
some of the members of the undefeated freshman team and you see
the strength of Stanford golf.
Speaking of the freshmen—the top six are Bill Sechrest, Kim
Corbin, Jim Rheim, Jeff Johnson, Jerry Hanweck and Robert Sherrer.
Watch out for Hanweck. He holds the Desert Inn course record along
with pro Art Wall with a torrid 65.


STEVE SMITH
pressure player
The day was Saturday, May 6. and Stanford’s undefeated golf
team had its streak of eight straight dual matches on the tine. With
the final foursome having but one hole to go, the Cards were in big
trouble.
Coach Bud Finger, a top-notch golfer himself and a former Stan
ford captain, was obviously nervous.
“I KNEW we were in trouble,” related the Coach. “If Dave Munro
wins the hole then we lie the match.” Our only way to win it out
right is for Steve Smith to beat UCLA’s Cliff Davis. With these
facts in mind I walked out to the 18th tee,
“To be honest with you, I feel that Smith is one of the best pres
sure players in the country. I put it straight to him and let him know
what he had to do for us to win.”

The now famous description
began to unfold. Davis teed off
first and pulled his drive slightly
to the left. Smith, a fine competi
tor. drilled one about 260 down the
middle of the fairway on the
tough 430-yard par four hole.
TO LISTEN to an excited and
happy Bud Finger continue the
tale: “Davis is a local hoy, from
Menlo Park and he knows the
course well. But it is a rainy and
windy day and he needs a very
straight shot to the green to avoid
this tree which is about 120 yards
short of the green. He went after
the flag with a four wood, off of
a downhill lie. and faded it badly
to the right. The ball was headed
out-of-bounds and I felt pretty
good for it looked like we would
pull out of the match alright.
“But the ball hit a springy
branch of a tree which was itself

out-of-bounds. It’s hard to believe, but the ball actually came straight j
back and remained in play.”
Smith hit his five iron shot up there pretty good to the elevated !
green, but the combination of the wind and a slight fade flipped the j
ball into the right-hand trap. The white pellet buried itself in the j
wet saiTtl.
FINGER was worried now—almost as if the match was not over,
and he was going through the agony for the very first time. He
continued, "Davis, who was the California State Junior Champion
in 1959 had an easy pitch shot home, but for some reason he stubbed
it and got himself into real trouble. Now he had to go over a trap
and under a menacing tree to get on the green. He made a real fine
shot though, and the ball ended up about 35 feet from the cup, just
off the edge of the putting surface.
“Smith, pulled a tremendous shot o> t of the bag from his buried
lie. He hit the pin and the ball dropped six feet from the cup. Things
looked bright again, for although Dave Munro had failed to get his
par to assure us a tie, we were now in relatively easy position to I
close out the match anyway.
“Steve came over to me and was obviously feeling pretty good, I
for his opponent lay just off the green in four while Steve was just
six feet away in three. The logical ending saw both men two putting
and Stanford winning the match.
“BFT WOULDN'T you just know it—Davis rolled it in for his
five. There it was—a six foot pressure putt. If Smith misses we
lose 15-12. If he knocks it in we win 141i-12‘s.”
What Smith did is history. Stanford today possesses a dual meet
record of eleven straight victories as this weekend’s AAWU Cham
pionship approaches.

Smith has had help

To attain a record such as this there has to be more than just
Steve Smith. And there is. In fact, Smith has not even been playing
number one.
SKNIOR KKNT WINTON and junior Bill Parish have been alter
nating in the top spot, and each has outstanding credentials. Winton
won the California State Fair Tourney last year beating Vorn Calli
son. Callison is the present National Public Links champion and
California State champ. Kent has been a consistent performer here
for three years. Parish has gone as well as 67 on the exacting Stan
ford layout, and this year he and pro Tommy Jacobs teamed to
finish third in Bing Crosby’s Pro-Amateur Tournament.
Smith, number three on the now-frozen ladder, just won the all
university championship. He is also the Wisconsin State champion
and last summer was runner up in the NCAA championship, losing
on the final hole to defending titleholder Dick Crawford of Houston.

lose 15-12. If he knocks it in we win 141i-12‘s.”
What Smith did is history. Stanford today possesses a dual meet
record of eleven straight victories as this weekend’s AAWU Cham
pionship approaches.

Smith has had help

To attain a record such as this there has to be more than just
Steve Smith. And there is. In fact, Smith has not even been playing
number one.
SKNIOR KKNT WINTON and junior Bill Parish have been alter
nating in the top spot, and each has outstanding credentials. Winton
won the California State Fair Tourney last year beating Vorn Calli
son. Callison is the present National Public Links champion and
California State champ. Kent has been a consistent performer here
for three years. Parish has gone as well as 67 on the exacting Stan
ford layout, and this year he and pro Tommy Jacobs teamed to
finish third in Bing Crosby’s Pro-Amateur Tournament.
Smith, number three on the now-frozen ladder, just won the all
university championship. He is also the Wisconsin State champion
and last summer was runner up in the NCAA championship, losing
on the final hole to defending titleholder Dick Crawford of Houston.
But. perhaps Steve’s most noteworthy triumph is a 4-3 decision over
the world’s top amateur Jack Nicklaus. The match came in last sum
mer’s NCAA Tourney.
Playing in the number four slot is Bill Welch. Bill is just a
sophomore and could develop into one of the real good ones.
SKNIOIi PHIL UNDKRWOOD and sophomore Dave Munro have
been playing in the fifth and sixth spots respectively. Underwood
fashioned the lowest competitive round on the squad this season with
his 66 against San Jose State on the San Jose course. Munro accord
ing to Finger “should be a threat next year.’’
Add to this list Ralph Marron, a long hitter who worked all the
way up the ladder to where he actually was ranked sixth; Gappy
Hurst, the diminutive but beautifully coordinated sophomore, and
some of the members of the undefeated freshman team and you see
the strength of Stanford golf.
Speaking of the freshmen—the top six are Bill Sechrest, Kim
Corbin, Jim Rheim, Jeff Johnson, Jerry Hanweck and Robert Sherrer.
Watch out for Hanweck. He holds the Desert Inn course record along
with pro Art Wall with a torrid 65.

The day was Saturday, May 6. and Stanford’s undefeated golf
team had its streak of eight straight dual matches on the tine. With
the final foursome having but one hole to go, the Cards were in big
trouble.
Coach Bud Finger, a top-notch golfer himself and a former Stan
ford captain, was obviously nervous.
“I KNEW we were in trouble,” related the Coach. “If Dave Munro
wins the hole then we lie the match.” Our only way to win it out
right is for Steve Smith to beat UCLA’s Cliff Davis. With these
facts in mind I walked out to the 18th tee,
“To be honest with you, I feel that Smith is one of the best pres
sure players in the country. I put it straight to him and let him know
what he had to do for us to win.”

The now famous description
began to unfold. Davis teed off
first and pulled his drive slightly
to the left. Smith, a fine competi
tor. drilled one about 260 down the
middle of the fairway on the
tough 430-yard par four hole.
TO LISTEN to an excited and
happy Bud Finger continue the
tale: “Davis is a local hoy, from
Menlo Park and he knows the
course well. But it is a rainy and
windy day and he needs a very
straight shot to the green to avoid
this tree which is about 120 yards
short of the green. He went after
the flag with a four wood, off of
a downhill lie. and faded it badly
to the right. The ball was headed
out-of-bounds and I felt pretty
good for it looked like we would
pull out of the match alright.
“But the ball hit a springy
branch of a tree which was itself

out-of-bounds. It’s hard to believe, but the ball actually came straight j
back and remained in play.”
Smith hit his five iron shot up there pretty good to the elevated !
green, but the combination of the wind and a slight fade flipped the j
ball into the right-hand trap. The white pellet buried itself in the j
wet saiTtl.
FINGER was worried now—almost as if the match was not over,
and he was going through the agony for the very first time. He
continued, "Davis, who was the California State Junior Champion
in 1959 had an easy pitch shot home, but for some reason he stubbed
it and got himself into real trouble. Now he had to go over a trap
and under a menacing tree to get on the green. He made a real fine
shot though, and the ball ended up about 35 feet from the cup, just
off the edge of the putting surface.
“Smith, pulled a tremendous shot o> t of the bag from his buried
lie. He hit the pin and the ball dropped six feet from the cup. Things
looked bright again, for although Dave Munro had failed to get his
par to assure us a tie, we were now in relatively easy position to I
close out the match anyway.
“Steve came over to me and was obviously feeling pretty good, I
for his opponent lay just off the green in four while Steve was just
six feet away in three. The logical ending saw both men two putting
and Stanford winning the match.
“BFT WOULDN'T you just know it—Davis rolled it in for his
five. There it was—a six foot pressure putt. If Smith misses we
lose 15-12. If he knocks it in we win 141i-12‘s.”
