# Architects Plan Overhaul For Quad Fronting
## 
### 
Stanford Board of Trustees has
appointed two San Francisco ar
chitectural firms to design an
overhaul of the outer Quad,
The planned renovations are a
part of the PACE program (“Plan
of Action for a Challenging Era")
and will cost more than $4 million.
The renewal will affect the build
ing interiors along virtually the
entire front of the Quad facing
Sena Street.
THE ARCHITECTURAL firm
of Spencer and Lee will design
the modernization of the quarters
now occupied by the physics and
biology departments. The other
firm, Milton T. Pflueger, will
draw plans to expand the law
school.
As a result of the moderniza
tion plans, the Graduate School of
Business along with the biology
and physics departments will be
relocated in new buildings.
By taking over the quarters
now occupied by the business
school, the law school will be able
to expand its library. The first
phase of the law school’s expan
sion will start in 1962 with a re
modeling of the Law School An
nex.
THE BUSINESS SCHOOL will
then relocate in a new building of
its own, west of Memorial Hall.
After the physics and biology
departments leave their present
locations, the mathematics depart
ment will move into the rooms,
which will have been renovated in
the meantime.
The psychology, sociology, and
anthropology departments will
move into quarters next door to
the mathematics department,
where biology is now housed.
THE PHYSICS department will
relocate in the new Varian Labo
ratory of Physics when that build
ing is completed in 1962. It is
now under construction on the
side of Lomita Drive opposite the
present physics corner.
With the completion of the Va
rian Laboratory, Lomita Drive
will be closed from Sen a to Santa
Teresa streets because of the
heavy pedestrian traffic between
the main and science Quads.
