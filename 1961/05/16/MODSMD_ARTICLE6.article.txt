# Majors Program Opens Tonight; Help Intended
## 
### 
In a Special Majors Program to be inaugurated tonight, 21
leading faculty members will talk on their departments and the
prospects for majors in each, in seven separate panel discussions
set for 6:30 p.m. in Wilbur and Branner lounges.
The two-day program is presented by Stanford Today and
Tomorrow with the intention of helping undeclared students,
particularly freshmen and sophomores, get first hand informa
tion on majors in which they are interested. Students at all
levels, including upperclassmen dissatisfied with their present
major, are invited to the talks.
EACH SEMINAR-TYPE mooting will consist of short talks by
faculty representatives of three or four related departments fol
lowed by an open question period. According to ST&T chairman
Bill Butler, the program is designed to enable listeners to com
pare departments in the same area in which they may be inter
ested.
Each professor has been asked expecially to stress what spe
cifically it entails to major in his field, fall quarter courses aimed
at sophomores, and honors programs.
