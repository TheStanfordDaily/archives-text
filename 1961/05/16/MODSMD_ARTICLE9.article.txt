# Furor Rages-LASSU Reviews Chappie
## Dean Elaborates Stand; Chappies Decry Action 
### FRANCES FISHER 
Repercussions from the Chaparral parody on Playboy and the
subsequent suspension of the magazine and its editor, Brad Efron,
reverberated throughout the campus yesterday.

In addition to the furor of discussion over the issue, LASSU called
a special session to hear the administration's point of view on the

matter, Efron wrote a letter of
apology to Chaplain Robert
Minto and Roman Catholic Arch
bishop John J. Mitty for his
“Ribald Classic” and Chappie staf
fers held informal discussion in
the Branner Lobby.

The jocular atmosphere of last
Thursday’s LASSU meeting was
absent last night in the special
session of Legislature in which
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler presented answers to the
most common questions arising
about the issue.

Although the Legislature mem
bers appeared to supoprt the
Dean in his decisions, no defini
tive action was taken.

WIN BIGLER emphasized that
the PACE program was not re
sponsible for any of the action
taken; he neither mentioned it to
Efron before the publication of
the Chappie nor had it in mind
when he took the action of sus
pension.
The Dean added, however, that
after he had suspended the maga
zine and Efron he had pointed out
to Efron that this is an embarras
sing time for the Chaparral to
stop publication because of the
money planned for a new publica
tions building.
“Although certain people, espe
cially in religious communities
have commented on this matter,
their comments did not come di
rectly to me.” Winbigler said,
stressing the point that the action
was taken simply because the
magazine did not measure up to
acceptable levels of propriety.
In a telephone conversation
with the Daily, Father John Tier
ney of the Newman Club stated
that “as far as the Church is con
cerned the issue of the Chaparral
is closed.” He said that he did not
wish to be implicated in the mat
ter in any way and declined to
comment on his conversation with
Fred Glover, executive assistant
to President Wallace Sterling.

IN HIS APOLOGY to the cler
ics Efron expressed his regret
that the “Ribald Classic” offended
so many people. He said “the
article in question was intended
to be a literary criticism, not sac
rilege of any kind.”
“I was attempting to ridicule
what I considered pseudo-cultural
pornography” Efron pointed out
in reference to his article. He
continued “obviously and unfor
tunately, I failed to make the
point of my criticism clear. What
I was trying to ridicule became
confused with the instrument of
my ridicule.”
At the Branner Lobby last
night, Chappie staffers Judy Skin
ner and Lou Padulo expressed
their feeling that the Dean’s ac
tion was too strong, considering
the content of the magazine. Pa
dulo stated “Brad wrote nothing
here that was any more contro
versial than what he wrote all the
time while attending Cal Tech.”

THE fact that Efron, who is a
graduate student in statistics had
been here less than a year, was
pointed out at the LASSU meeting
last night. In reply to Charles
Landis Chappie Business Mana
ger’s comment that Efron did not
think that the issue was so bad,
Winbigler said “If Efron expected
this issue to be accepted, he is in
credibly naive in his judgment.”
Concerning the severity of the
action taken against Efron, Win
bigier said that “suspension is a
very clean effective thing to do.”
He further stated that suspension
is about the only punitive meas
ure the University has and that
it is not as unusual as many stu
dents think. He said that 25 stu
dents had been suspended from
the University for non-academic
reasons this year.
Larry Royse, ASSU President,
stated that he “would like to en
courage the Legislature members
to discourage Chappie staff mem
bers from publishing (his type of
material.”

However at the Soto lounge last
night, Chappie staffer Padulo
said. “It you think there’s no
place for risque articles at Stan
ford then say so and the Chappie
won’t write it.”

THE fact that Efron, who is a
graduate student in statistics had
been here less than a year, was
pointed out at the LASSU meeting
last night. In reply to Charles
Landis Chappie Business Mana
ger’s comment that Efron did not
think that the issue was so bad,
Winbigler said “If Efron expected
this issue to be accepted, he is in
credibly naive in his judgment.”
Concerning the severity of the
action taken against Efron, Win
bigier said that “suspension is a
very clean effective thing to do.”
He further stated that suspension
is about the only punitive meas
ure the University has and that
it is not as unusual as many stu
dents think. He said that 25 stu
dents had been suspended from
the University for non-academic
reasons this year.
Larry Royse, ASSU President,
stated that he “would like to en
courage the Legislature members
to discourage Chappie staff mem
bers from publishing (his type of
material.”

However at the Soto lounge last
night, Chappie staffer Padulo
said. “It you think there’s no
place for risque articles at Stan
ford then say so and the Chappie
won’t write it.”
Repercussions from the Chaparral parody on Playboy and the
subsequent suspension of the magazine and its editor, Brad Efron,
reverberated throughout the campus yesterday.

In addition to the furor of discussion over the issue, LASSU called
a special session to hear the administration's point of view on the

matter, Efron wrote a letter of
apology to Chaplain Robert
Minto and Roman Catholic Arch
bishop John J. Mitty for his
“Ribald Classic” and Chappie staf
fers held informal discussion in
the Branner Lobby.

The jocular atmosphere of last
Thursday’s LASSU meeting was
absent last night in the special
session of Legislature in which
Dean of Students H. Donald Win
bigler presented answers to the
most common questions arising
about the issue.

Although the Legislature mem
bers appeared to supoprt the
Dean in his decisions, no defini
tive action was taken.

WIN BIGLER emphasized that
the PACE program was not re
sponsible for any of the action
taken; he neither mentioned it to
Efron before the publication of
the Chappie nor had it in mind
when he took the action of sus
pension.
The Dean added, however, that
after he had suspended the maga
zine and Efron he had pointed out
to Efron that this is an embarras
sing time for the Chaparral to
stop publication because of the
money planned for a new publica
tions building.
“Although certain people, espe
cially in religious communities
have commented on this matter,
their comments did not come di
rectly to me.” Winbigler said,
stressing the point that the action
was taken simply because the
magazine did not measure up to
acceptable levels of propriety.
In a telephone conversation
with the Daily, Father John Tier
ney of the Newman Club stated
that “as far as the Church is con
cerned the issue of the Chaparral
is closed.” He said that he did not
wish to be implicated in the mat
ter in any way and declined to
comment on his conversation with
Fred Glover, executive assistant
to President Wallace Sterling.

IN HIS APOLOGY to the cler
ics Efron expressed his regret
that the “Ribald Classic” offended
so many people. He said “the
article in question was intended
to be a literary criticism, not sac
rilege of any kind.”
“I was attempting to ridicule
what I considered pseudo-cultural
pornography” Efron pointed out
in reference to his article. He
continued “obviously and unfor
tunately, I failed to make the
point of my criticism clear. What
I was trying to ridicule became
confused with the instrument of
my ridicule.”
At the Branner Lobby last
night, Chappie staffers Judy Skin

was taken simply because the
magazine did not measure up to
acceptable levels of propriety.
In a telephone conversation
with the Daily, Father John Tier
ney of the Newman Club stated
that “as far as the Church is con
cerned the issue of the Chaparral
is closed.” He said that he did not
wish to be implicated in the mat
ter in any way and declined to
comment on his conversation with
Fred Glover, executive assistant
to President Wallace Sterling.

IN HIS APOLOGY to the cler
ics Efron expressed his regret
that the “Ribald Classic” offended
so many people. He said “the
article in question was intended
to be a literary criticism, not sac
rilege of any kind.”
“I was attempting to ridicule
what I considered pseudo-cultural
pornography” Efron pointed out
in reference to his article. He
continued “obviously and unfor
tunately, I failed to make the
point of my criticism clear. What
I was trying to ridicule became
confused with the instrument of
my ridicule.”
At the Branner Lobby last
night, Chappie staffers Judy Skin
ner and Lou Padulo expressed
their feeling that the Dean’s ac
tion was too strong, considering
the content of the magazine. Pa
dulo stated “Brad wrote nothing
here that was any more contro
versial than what he wrote all the
time while attending Cal Tech.”

THE fact that Efron, who is a
graduate student in statistics had
been here less than a year, was
pointed out at the LASSU meeting
last night. In reply to Charles
Landis Chappie Business Mana
ger’s comment that Efron did not
think that the issue was so bad,
Winbigler said “If Efron expected
this issue to be accepted, he is in
credibly naive in his judgment.”
Concerning the severity of the
action taken against Efron, Win
bigier said that “suspension is a
very clean effective thing to do.”
He further stated that suspension
is about the only punitive meas
ure the University has and that
it is not as unusual as many stu
dents think. He said that 25 stu
dents had been suspended from
the University for non-academic
reasons this year.
Larry Royse, ASSU President,
stated that he “would like to en
courage the Legislature members
to discourage Chappie staff mem
bers from publishing (his type of
material.”

However at the Soto lounge last
night, Chappie staffer Padulo
said. “It you think there’s no
place for risque articles at Stan
ford then say so and the Chappie
won’t write it.”
