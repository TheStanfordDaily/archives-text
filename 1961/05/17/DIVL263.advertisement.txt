OLD GRADS NEVER DIE
In just a matter of weeks many of you will be graduating—
especially seniors.
You are of course eager to go out in the great world where
opportunities are limitless and deans nonexistent. At the same
time your hearts arc heavy at the thought of losing touch with
so many classmates you have come to know and love.
It is ray pleasant task today to assure you that graduation
need not mean losing touch with classmates; all you have to do
is join the Alumni Association and every year you will receive
a bright, newsy, chatty bulletin, chock full of information about
Oh, what a red-letter day it is at my house, the day the
Alumni Bulletin arrives! I cancel all my engagements, take the
phone off the hook, dismiss my chiropractor, put the ocelot
outside, and settle down for an evening of pure pleasure with
the Bulletin and (need I add?) a good supply of Marlboro
Cigarettes.
Whenever I am having fun, a Marlboro makes the fun even
more fun. That filter, that flavor, that pack or box never fails
to heighten my pleasure whether I am watching the television
or playing buck euchre or knitting an afghan or reading Mad
or enjoying any other fun-filled pursuit you might name—ex
cept, of course, spearfishing. But then, how much spearfishing
does one do in Clovis, New Mexico, where I live?
But I digress. Let us return to my Alumni Bulletin and let
me quote for you the interesting tidings about all my old friends
and classmates;
Well, fellow alums, it certainly has been a wing-dinger of a
year for all us old grads! Remember Mildred Cheddar and
Harry Camembert, those crazy kids who always held hands in
Econ II? Well, they’re married now and living in Clovis, New
Mexico, where Harry rents spearfishing equipment and Mildred
has just given birth to a lovely 28-pound daughter, her second
in four months. Nice going, Mildred and Harry!
Remember Jethro Brie, the man we voted most likely to suc
ceed? Well, old Jethro is still gathering laurels! Last week he
was voted “Motorman of the Year” by his fellow workers in
the Duluth streetcar system. “I owe it all to my brakeman,”
said Jethro in a characteristically modest acceptance speech.
Same old Jethro!
Probably the most glamorous time of all us alums was had by
Francis Macomber last year. He went on a big game hunting
safari all the way to Africa! We received many interesting post
cards from Francis until he was, alas, accidently shot and killed
by his wife and white hunter. Tough luck, Francis!
Wilma ‘‘Deadeye” Macomlier, widow of the late beloved
Francis Macomber, was married yesterday to Fred “Sureshot”
Quimby, white hunter, in a simple double-ring ceremony in
Nairobi. Good luck, Wilma and Fred!
Well, alums, that just about wraps it np for this year. Keep
