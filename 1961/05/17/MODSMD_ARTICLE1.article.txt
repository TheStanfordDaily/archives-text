# 'Antenna Farm’ Is Part of SU Space Research

Gifted though he was, Sen. Ice
land Stanford could never have
guessed that his foresight in 1885
would someday make his Farm a
world center of space research.
Big dishes and out-of-this-world
radio devices are strewn over
nearly 2,000 acres of Stanford’s
vast campus.

POINTED skyward, the strange
instruments catch eerie space
noises beamed our way from un
known sources. With radar fin
gers they reach out to explore the
far corners of our solar ssytem.

Radioscience Laboratory inves
tigators who conduct this re
search have found themselves
working on every continent of the
world including the Antarctic.
Conversely, many students and
specialists from other nations
have been drawn to Stanford
where they find themselves in the
forefront of world research on
space and its problems.

BUT for Stanford’s remarkable
prescience, these developments
might never have come to pass.
He stipulated that his Palo Alto
Stock Farm’s 8.800 acres, with
which he endowed the University,
should never be sold.

“Their proper management will
insure to the University an in
come much greater than would bo
realized were their value to he in
vested in any reliable interest
bearing security,” ho said.
STANFORD’S generous land
endowment already has resulted
in the antenna farm’s case in

development of one of the world’s
most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation.
The present work really began
in October 1916, when four Stan
ford electrical engineering stu
dents realized a once-in-a-lifetime
chance to test the idea that radio
effects were closely connected
with meteors.
Three of these students who re
mained to continue and expand
their meteor studies formed the
nucleus of Stanford’s present Ra
dioscience Laboratory; Profs.
Robert A. Helliwell, Laurence A.
Manning and O. G. Villard Jr. Ad
ditions since have been Profs.
Ronald N. Bracewell, Von R. Esh
leman, Allen M. Peterson, Allen
T. Waterman Jr. and the late Dr.
Philip B. Gallagher.
ACHIEVEMENTS of this group
have been outstanding.
One of the most spectacular was
the first radar contact of the sun.
announced a little more than a
year ago by Eshleman, Gallagher,
and then graduate student Lt. Col.
Robert C. Barthle of the Signal
Corps.
It was only one outgrowth of
the early meteor echo studies
which Manning and Villard have
carried to amazing lengths.
Speed of meteoric particles can
now be measured to determine
whether they are slow enough to
be considered members of our
solar system. Movements of their

ionized trails can reveal the speed
of the upper atmosphere’s high
winds.

PERHAPS more important is
that the size, strength, and occur
rences of meteoric ionization are
now being mapped and predicted,
making them useful to communi
cation enginers. Already the fre
quency spectrum normally avail
able for communications has been
markedly increased by the Stan
ford-developed technique of bounc
ing signals off meteor trails.
Oiher work of the laboratory
involves exploration of the iono
sphere as a whole -a study *of
“the dynamics of the global at
mosphere.”
The need for communicating
with satellites and space probes
makes it imperative to better un
derstand the complex interactions
among I he northern and southern
hemispheres of the ionosphere, its
auroral and equatorial zones and
the earth’s magnetic field.
STANFORD pioneered a new
approach to these studies the
use of “ionospherically propa
gated ground-backseat ter” to de
tect both calm and disturbed re
gions of the ionosphere hundreds
or even thousands of miles away.

The satellite era ushered in by
Sputnik has enabled the radio in
vestigators ot study upper regions
of the ionosphere they had found
largely inaccessible. Careful mon
itoring and measurement of a
satellite’s signal reveals the den
sity and location of ionization be
tween it and the receiver.

Going beyond the ionosphere,
“whistler” studies under Helli
well’s direction have led to even
more unusual modes of communi
cation.

ACCORDING to now well-ac
cepted theory, whistlers are low
frequency signals caused by light
ning discharges. The whistling
sound results from a “spreading
out” of the signal during its travel
through space along a line of
force in the earth’s magnetic field.
Helliwell and his group have
further tested these theories with
standard low-frequency signals
and find that the whistler paths—
which they term “space ducts”—
will also support radio communi
cations.

They also have built ultra-com
pact radio equipment for satellite
experiments which use the space
ducts in communications. The
most recent experiment of this
kind was the Navy’s LOFTI (Low
Frequency Trans-lonosphoric sat
ellite).

AS Helliwell’s group had pre
dicted, LOFTI proved that VLF
signals from the ground would
penetrate the lonosphere and be
received by the satelite. It “op
ened up a whole new’ field of sci
entific investigation that may lead
to remarkable advances in mili
tary communications and space
vehicle navigation,” said the
Navy.

One possibility is that the satel
lites might be able to rebroadcast
the message to submerged subma-

rines, thus providing a new chan
nel of communication with the un
dersea craft.
One of the most unusual and
elaborate instalaltions of the an
tenna farm is the “microwave
spectroholiograph,” a 32-dish ra
dio telescope used by Bracewell
for solar studies.
MECHANICALLY and electron
ically synchronized, the huge ar
ray of 10-foot dishes scans the
sun’s face all day with a pencil
like beam only 1/15th of a degree
in diameter. It is designed for de
tailed examination of the chromo
sphere—the fiery surface layer of
the sun.
The antenna farm would not be
complete without the familiar
“big dish” radio telescopes. In this
type of apparatus the University
has collaborated with Stanford
Research Institute.

The Institute now operates a
60-foot steerable dish on the an
tenna farm, and is readying a 150-
foot parabola.
THE two parabolic antennas
are intended for use primarily in
"radar astronomy,” which deals
with echoes from man-made sig
nals.
The 60-foot dish was the first to
make radar contact with Sputnik
I, and it has proved a highly use
ful research instrument under the
direction of Peterson.

The 20- to 60-megacycle trans
mitter, requiring a million-watt
input, will be the most powerful
ever built in its frequency range.

“whistler” studies under Helli
well’s direction have led to even
more unusual modes of communi
cation.

ACCORDING to now well-ac
cepted theory, whistlers are low
frequency signals caused by light
ning discharges. The whistling
sound results from a “spreading
out” of the signal during its travel
through space along a line of
force in the earth’s magnetic field.
Helliwell and his group have
further tested these theories with
standard low-frequency signals
and find that the whistler paths—
which they term “space ducts”—
will also support radio communi
cations.

They also have built ultra-com
pact radio equipment for satellite
experiments which use the space
ducts in communications. The
most recent experiment of this
kind was the Navy’s LOFTI (Low
Frequency Trans-lonosphoric sat
ellite).

AS Helliwell’s group had pre
dicted, LOFTI proved that VLF
signals from the ground would
penetrate the lonosphere and be
received by the satelite. It “op
ened up a whole new’ field of sci
entific investigation that may lead
to remarkable advances in mili
tary communications and space
vehicle navigation,” said the
Navy.

One possibility is that the satel
lites might be able to rebroadcast
the message to submerged subma-

rines, thus providing a new chan
nel of communication with the un
dersea craft.
One of the most unusual and
elaborate instalaltions of the an
tenna farm is the “microwave
spectroholiograph,” a 32-dish ra
dio telescope used by Bracewell
for solar studies.
MECHANICALLY and electron
ically synchronized, the huge ar
ray of 10-foot dishes scans the
sun’s face all day with a pencil
like beam only 1/15th of a degree
in diameter. It is designed for de
tailed examination of the chromo
sphere—the fiery surface layer of
the sun.
The antenna farm would not be
complete without the familiar
“big dish” radio telescopes. In this
type of apparatus the University
has collaborated with Stanford
Research Institute.

The Institute now operates a
60-foot steerable dish on the an
tenna farm, and is readying a 150-
foot parabola.
THE two parabolic antennas
are intended for use primarily in
"radar astronomy,” which deals
with echoes from man-made sig
nals.
The 60-foot dish was the first to
make radar contact with Sputnik
I, and it has proved a highly use
ful research instrument under the
direction of Peterson.

The 20- to 60-megacycle trans
mitter, requiring a million-watt
input, will be the most powerful
ever built in its frequency range.


STANFORD’S ANTENNA FARM
Devices Catch Noises from Space
Gifted though he was, Sen. Ice
land Stanford could never have
guessed that his foresight in 1885
would someday make his Farm a
world center of space research.
Big dishes and out-of-this-world
radio devices are strewn over
nearly 2,000 acres of Stanford’s
vast campus.

POINTED skyward, the strange
instruments catch eerie space
noises beamed our way from un
known sources. With radar fin
gers they reach out to explore the
far corners of our solar ssytem.

Radioscience Laboratory inves

working on every continent of the
world including the Antarctic.
Conversely, many students and
specialists from other nations
have been drawn to Stanford
where they find themselves in the
forefront of world research on
space and its problems.

BUT for Stanford’s remarkable
prescience, these developments
might never have come to pass.

Speed of meteoric particles can

that the size, strength, and occur

development of one of the world’s

The present work really began
in October 1916, when four Stan
ford electrical engineering stu
dents realized a once-in-a-lifetime
chance to test the idea that radio
effects were closely connected

year ago by Eshleman, Gallagher,
and then graduate student Lt. Col.
Robert C. Barthle of the Signal
Corps.
It was only one outgrowth of
the early meteor echo studies
which Manning and Villard have
carried to amazing lengths.
Speed of meteoric particles can
now be measured to determine
whether they are slow enough to
be considered members of our
solar system. Movements of their

ionized trails can reveal the speed
of the upper atmosphere’s high
winds.

PERHAPS more important is
that the size, strength, and occur
rences of meteoric ionization are
now being mapped and predicted,
making them useful to communi
cation enginers. Already the fre
quency spectrum normally avail
able for communications has been
markedly increased by the Stan
ford-developed technique of bounc
ing signals off meteor trails.
Oiher work of the laboratory
involves exploration of the iono
sphere as a whole -a study *of
“the dynamics of the global at
mosphere.”
The need for communicating
with satellites and space probes
makes it imperative to better un
derstand the complex interactions
among I he northern and southern
hemispheres of the ionosphere, its
auroral and equatorial zones and
the earth’s magnetic field.
STANFORD pioneered a new
approach to these studies the
use of “ionospherically propa
gated ground-backseat ter” to de
tect both calm and disturbed re
gions of the ionosphere hundreds
or even thousands of miles away.

The satellite era ushered in by
Sputnik has enabled the radio in
vestigators ot study upper regions
of the ionosphere they had found
largely inaccessible. Careful mon
itoring and measurement of a
satellite’s signal reveals the den
sity and location of ionization be
tween it and the receiver.

Going beyond the ionosphere,
“whistler” studies under Helli
well’s direction have led to even
more unusual modes of communi
cation.

ACCORDING to now well-ac
cepted theory, whistlers are low
frequency signals caused by light
ning discharges. The whistling
sound results from a “spreading
out” of the signal during its travel
through space along a line of
force in the earth’s magnetic field.
Helliwell and his group have
further tested these theories with
standard low-frequency signals
and find that the whistler paths—
which they term “space ducts”—
will also support radio communi
cations.

They also have built ultra-com
pact radio equipment for satellite
experiments which use the space
ducts in communications. The
most recent experiment of this
kind was the Navy’s LOFTI (Low
Frequency Trans-lonosphoric sat
ellite).

AS Helliwell’s group had pre
dicted, LOFTI proved that VLF
signals from the ground would
penetrate the lonosphere and be
received by the satelite. It “op
ened up a whole new’ field of sci
entific investigation that may lead
to remarkable advances in mili
tary communications and space
vehicle navigation,” said the
Navy.

One possibility is that the satel
lites might be able to rebroadcast
the message to submerged subma-

rines, thus providing a new chan
nel of communication with the un
dersea craft.
One of the most unusual and
elaborate instalaltions of the an
tenna farm is the “microwave
spectroholiograph,” a 32-dish ra
dio telescope used by Bracewell
for solar studies.
MECHANICALLY and electron
ically synchronized, the huge ar
ray of 10-foot dishes scans the
sun’s face all day with a pencil
like beam only 1/15th of a degree
in diameter. It is designed for de
tailed examination of the chromo
sphere—the fiery surface layer of
the sun.
The antenna farm would not be
complete without the familiar
“big dish” radio telescopes. In this
type of apparatus the University
has collaborated with Stanford
Research Institute.

The Institute now operates a
60-foot steerable dish on the an
tenna farm, and is readying a 150-
foot parabola.
THE two parabolic antennas
are intended for use primarily in
"radar astronomy,” which deals
with echoes from man-made sig
nals.
The 60-foot dish was the first to
make radar contact with Sputnik
I, and it has proved a highly use
ful research instrument under the
direction of Peterson.

The 20- to 60-megacycle trans
mitter, requiring a million-watt
input, will be the most powerful
ever built in its frequency range.

rines, thus providing a new chan

dersea craft.
One of the most unusual and
elaborate instalaltions of the an
tenna farm is the “microwave
spectroholiograph,” a 32-dish ra
dio telescope used by Bracewell
for solar studies.
MECHANICALLY and electron
ically synchronized, the huge ar
ray of 10-foot dishes scans the
sun’s face all day with a pencil
like beam only 1/15th of a degree
in diameter. It is designed for de
tailed examination of the chromo
sphere—the fiery surface layer of
the sun.
The antenna farm would not be
complete without the familiar
“big dish” radio telescopes. In this
type of apparatus the University
has collaborated with Stanford
Research Institute.

The Institute now operates a
60-foot steerable dish on the an
tenna farm, and is readying a 150-
foot parabola.
THE two parabolic antennas
are intended for use primarily in
"radar astronomy,” which deals
with echoes from man-made sig
nals.
The 60-foot dish was the first to
make radar contact with Sputnik
I, and it has proved a highly use
ful research instrument under the
direction of Peterson.

The 20- to 60-megacycle trans
mitter, requiring a million-watt
input, will be the most powerful
ever built in its frequency range.


STANFORD’S ANTENNA FARM
Devices Catch Noises from Space
Gifted though he was, Sen. Ice
land Stanford could never have
guessed that his foresight in 1885
would someday make his Farm a
world center of space research.
Big dishes and out-of-this-world
radio devices are strewn over
nearly 2,000 acres of Stanford’s
vast campus.

POINTED skyward, the strange
instruments catch eerie space
noises beamed our way from un
known sources. With radar fin
gers they reach out to explore the
far corners of our solar ssytem.

Radioscience Laboratory inves
tigators who conduct this re
search have found themselves
working on every continent of the
world including the Antarctic.
Conversely, many students and
specialists from other nations
have been drawn to Stanford
where they find themselves in the
forefront of world research on
space and its problems.

BUT for Stanford’s remarkable
prescience, these developments
might never have come to pass.
He stipulated that his Palo Alto
Stock Farm’s 8.800 acres, with
which he endowed the University,
should never be sold.

“Their proper management will
insure to the University an in
come much greater than would bo
realized were their value to he in
vested in any reliable interest
bearing security,” ho said.
STANFORD’S generous land
endowment already has resulted
in the antenna farm’s case in

development of one of the world’s
most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation.
The present work really began
in October 1916, when four Stan
ford electrical engineering stu
dents realized a once-in-a-lifetime
chance to test the idea that radio
effects were closely connected
with meteors.
Three of these students who re
mained to continue and expand
their meteor studies formed the
nucleus of Stanford’s present Ra
dioscience Laboratory; Profs.
Robert A. Helliwell, Laurence A.
Manning and O. G. Villard Jr. Ad
ditions since have been Profs.
Ronald N. Bracewell, Von R. Esh
leman, Allen M. Peterson, Allen
T. Waterman Jr. and the late Dr.
Philip B. Gallagher.
ACHIEVEMENTS of this group
have been outstanding.
One of the most spectacular was
the first radar contact of the sun.
announced a little more than a
year ago by Eshleman, Gallagher,
and then graduate student Lt. Col.
Robert C. Barthle of the Signal
Corps.
It was only one outgrowth of
the early meteor echo studies
which Manning and Villard have
carried to amazing lengths.
Speed of meteoric particles can
now be measured to determine
whether they are slow enough to
be considered members of our
solar system. Movements of their

ionized trails can reveal the speed
of the upper atmosphere’s high
winds.

PERHAPS more important is
that the size, strength, and occur
rences of meteoric ionization are
now being mapped and predicted,
making them useful to communi
cation enginers. Already the fre
quency spectrum normally avail
able for communications has been
markedly increased by the Stan
ford-developed technique of bounc
ing signals off meteor trails.
Oiher work of the laboratory
involves exploration of the iono
sphere as a whole -a study *of
“the dynamics of the global at
mosphere.”
The need for communicating
with satellites and space probes
makes it imperative to better un
derstand the complex interactions
among I he northern and southern
hemispheres of the ionosphere, its
auroral and equatorial zones and
the earth’s magnetic field.
STANFORD pioneered a new
approach to these studies the
use of “ionospherically propa
gated ground-backseat ter” to de
tect both calm and disturbed re
gions of the ionosphere hundreds
or even thousands of miles away.

The satellite era ushered in by
Sputnik has enabled the radio in
vestigators ot study upper regions
of the ionosphere they had found
largely inaccessible. Careful mon
itoring and measurement of a
satellite’s signal reveals the den
sity and location of ionization be
tween it and the receiver.

Going beyond the ionosphere,
“whistler” studies under Helli
well’s direction have led to even
more unusual modes of communi
cation.

ACCORDING to now well-ac
cepted theory, whistlers are low
frequency signals caused by light
ning discharges. The whistling
sound results from a “spreading
out” of the signal during its travel
through space along a line of
force in the earth’s magnetic field.
Helliwell and his group have
further tested these theories with
standard low-frequency signals
and find that the whistler paths—
which they term “space ducts”—
will also support radio communi
cations.

They also have built ultra-com
pact radio equipment for satellite
experiments which use the space
ducts in communications. The
most recent experiment of this
kind was the Navy’s LOFTI (Low
Frequency Trans-lonosphoric sat
ellite).

AS Helliwell’s group had pre
dicted, LOFTI proved that VLF
signals from the ground would
penetrate the lonosphere and be
received by the satelite. It “op
ened up a whole new’ field of sci
entific investigation that may lead
to remarkable advances in mili
tary communications and space
vehicle navigation,” said the
Navy.

One possibility is that the satel
lites might be able to rebroadcast
the message to submerged subma-

rines, thus providing a new chan

dersea craft.
