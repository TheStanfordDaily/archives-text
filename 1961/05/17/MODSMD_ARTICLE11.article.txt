# French, Algerians Start Negotiations
## 
### 
With the air settled by President deGaulle's swift crushing of
the Algerian insurrectionists, the long-postponed peace talks to
negotiate an Algerian independence have been re-scheduled for
this Saturday.
The revolt, which occurred last month has dissipated the rebels’
distrust of President deGaulle. In France this "mutiny of the gen
erals" has served to further coalesce public opinion behind the
President. It does not seem that the extreme nationalists within
France, the European Algerians or the rebel generals, have enough
force to execute any well-planned, large-scale operation against the
government. There is no reason, however, not to expect the group
to resort in desperation to bombings and assassinations, of which
deGaulle will be the main target.
Hopefully, these ambuscade tactics of the few will not dissuade
the Algerian delegation from the negotiations. For it is obvious that,
although a large majority of Frenchmen accept an independent
Algeria, they wish an independence which preserves the economic
and blood ties that have existed for more than 100 years. DeGaulle
himself has made clear that he hopes to form a state that will desire
to maintain close association with France. He has noted another out
come of the negotiations which could take place. That is a hostile
rupture with France. He speaks, then, of regrouping French Alger
ians by transferring them to France and the deportation of the mil
lion Algerians now employed in France back to Algeria. This latter
course would be difficult to undertake; the hostilities it would cre
ate would be long-lasting. The first course of a sovereign Algeria,
but with close ties with France, remains the most intelligent deci
sion for both sides.
So far, President deGaulle has shown quantities of patience,
fearlessness, and perseverance to put an end to the six and one
half year-old rebellion. It is now up to the Algerian Provisional Gov
ernment ot show that it, too, can demonstrate the qualities of true
statesmanship.
