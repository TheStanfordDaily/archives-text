It is understandable that many individuals desire a more active,
personal part in combating world communism. But current demands
for congressional investigation of an organization whose leader has
charged three American Presidents with being Red tools underscore
again the pitfalls with beset the anti-Communist path.
J. Edgar Hoover, who probably knows as much as any American
about fighting communism, recently stated that the "job of curtailing
and containing communism is one for legally constituted authorities
with the steadfast cooperation of every loyal citizen." The FBI chief
does not deny the individual a role but he warns against "reckless
charges" and "vigilante action."
The FBI has made good use of citizens who as undercover agents
under its specific directions infiltrated and exposed Communist
groups. But Mr. Hoover knows how the work of professionals can be
hampered by reckless charges. False tips can divert the trackers,
and continued mistaken "wolf, wolf" alarms create apathy.
Alertness is urgently required. Too few Americans are awake to
the real nature of this evil. But excessive fear breeds a rejection of
dmocratic processes. It leads decent, honorable citizens to use dis
honorable and authoritarian means to combat the evils they fear.
It too often fosters a totalitarian attitude which attacks everyone
who will not fight communism in one prescribed way. It induces a
self-defeating, self-righteous distrust and tearing down of men who
lead freedom's cause in key sectors.
Indeed it would be easy to conclude that such damage to a
healthy America was planned in Moscow. And some thoughtful
moderates will contend that this "radicalism of the right" splits, dis
credits and weakens the very forces in America which should be
most effective in combating the opposite extremeâ€”that which in the
name of "liberalism" often appears to be "greasing the Communist
skids" by moving toward submergence of individual and local in
terests in a paternalistic superstate.
The core of totalitarianism is disregard for the individual. The
core of free societies is concern for the individual. This has its roots
in religious teachings that man is the son of God. Persons who keep
this distinction clear in their thought and action can indeed have an
active and wisely effective part in combating communism.
Positive trust in divine guidance and protection should displace
a conspiratorial distrust. Positive rededication to a religious sense
of brotherhood should lessen concern with divisive organizational
"fronts." More positive reliance on the spiritual force of truth, justice
and freedom (when exemplified) should ease obsessive fears of
subversion.
Study of and appreciation for precious civil liberties and indi
vidual rights should be a more positive answer than either the ma
ligning or misinterpretation of them. Active efforts to set up noble
goals and to provide the equality of opportunity which will permit
every individual to achieve his full potential is a more positive
answer than any anti-communism which adopts totalitarian methods
to fight totalitarianism.
