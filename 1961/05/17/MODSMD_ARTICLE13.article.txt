Real Muslims Speak
We the undersigned, some of
the Muslim students at Stanford
University, have been questioned
by our fellow students and other
friends about what is known as
the “Black Muslim” movement
that seems to be gaining great
attention across the U.S. recently.
Our knowledge of this movement
is limited to what we have read
about it in the U.S. newspapers
and to what some of us have wit
nessed at a meeting of the group
in Philadelphia a few years ago.
We feel obligated to bring to the
attention of the.public the Islamic
point of view on certain principles
of fundamental importance. We
trust you will find this letter
worthy of publication.
One of the principles that has
been emphasized in Islam more
than in most other religions, we
believe, is that of racial equality.
Not only has tihs principle been
stressed in the Quran time and
time again but Islamic history
abounds in examples where this
rule has been put into practice.
The Holy Prophet Mohammed
himself was instrumental in
bringing about the marriage of
his cousin, Zainab daughter of
Jahsh, to Zaid who happened to
be a Negro. In the eyes of Islam
there is no black Muslim and no
white Muslim. If the followers of
the “Black Muslim” movement
profess to follow Islam, we would
like to remind them that the pol
icy of black supremacy or hatred
of the white is just as contrary,
to the spirit and the laws of Islam
as the hatred of the black race
by some whites in some parts of
the world.
We seem to feel that this move
ment is, at least to some extent,
politically oriented and we are
disturbed by the fact that the
name of the religion is being un
duly dragged into politics. As for
eign students our stay in this
country has been limited; but
from what little we have seen we
can only conclude that there is
lots of room left for improve
ment in the educational, economic
and social status of Negroes in
this country. It would, on the
other hand, be unfair if we did
not realize that great effort has
been made in this country in the
recent past to improve race rela
tions. With mutual understanding
and patience, we feel progress
would continue to be made.

We are happy to notice that
great transformation has taken
place in the personal lives of most
of the people who have joined
the “Black Muslim” movement;
They have become law abiding
citizens according to several

newspaper reports; they observe
rules of honesty and decency,,
they dress modestly and they I
pray regularly five times a day. j
This is indeed what Islam, among I
other things, enjoins upon its fol-'
lowers.
If Islam has been instrumental
in bringing about this happy
transformation, we are delighted
and we thank God for His love
and guidance. We feel assured
that if the followers of this move
ment observe the rules and the
spirit of Islam in its totality,
rather than in part, nobler and
greater glories await them atid
the racial equality they seem to
be striving for may eventually
be achieved in a non-violent and
peaceful manner because Islam,
as some of them seem to know,
is the religion of peace and sub
mission.

Immoral Thoughts
Unless Stanford students are I
to be condemned for having im
moral thoughts or for making
these thoughts known to other
students, the only vice of the re
cent Chaparral parody is that its
inconsistency with the standard
of propriety to which society pur
portedly subscribes may offend
potential donors to the Univer-i
sity. The importance of limiting I
student activity which interferes j
with the campaign to raise funds
is indisputable, for without funds, i
the “bold” new programs of the
University can not be effectuated.
The Chaparral is not the only j
student activity having the po-1
tential to adversely affect Stan-1
ford’s public relations. Every stu-;
dent attempt to sponsor a con- [
troversial speaker, to espouse an j
unpopular opinion, or to sponsor 1
a program requiring funds from
outside sources has this poten- i
tial. To stifle this kind of activ-1
ity, as such activities frequently '
have been stifled in the past, is |
to warn students that original j
thinking which strays beyond the 1
bounds of propriety is not to be
tolerated. That official policy dis
courages independent student)
thinking is obvious when expul-1
sion becomes the penalty for ex
pressing thoughts contrary to an
undefinable standard of propri
ety.
It Is inconceivable that the
University’s public relations may
be maintained only by discourag
ing freedom of thought, a policy
which is antithetical to the high
est goals of any educational in
stitution. Would not Stanford
gain, even financially, from a rep

utatlon for promoting intellectual
development by providing a cli
mate which favors the free ex
pression of ideas?
I commend the Chaparral staff
for its humorous parody of Play
boy. It did not offend my sense
of propriety.

Bad Taste
Amid all the hullabaloo of the
latest issue of the Chappie, one
point should he kept clearly in
mind: the Chaparral is supposed
to be the campus humor maga
zine. If the Chappie serves its
purpose, it is a welcome part of
university life.
The question is: is the latest
Chappie humorous? In particu
lar, is the article of Editor Efron
a humorous one? Judgment
should be based upon this cri
terion.
The article of Editor Efron is
not humorous. Instead, it is but
a thinly-disguised attempt to rid
icule a Christian belief. The cheap
obscenity of the article is matched
only by the stupidity and had
taste of the editor. The university
officials should take the neces
sary step to insure that the next
issue of the Chaparral will be
humorous.

Once there was a man who had
a great and beautiful faith. He
believed in agreat savior whose
life and teachings were all re
corded in a great hook. And
among the teachings therein re
corded, there was one which said
one should pity the scoffers and
the disbelievers for they would
be condemned to eternal suffer
ing. And another said that if one’s
enemy struck one, one should
turn the other cheek. And in yet
another place this great savior
was quoted as saying: “Venge
ance is mine.”
Now one day this man found
himself beginning to doubt his
faith. And he became sore afraid
lest he lose his faith and be left
with no place to turn. And then
a scoffer appeared before him,
who laughed at his faith and
ridiculed it. Whereupon the man
rose up in towering rage and
persecuted this scoffer unto his
ruin. Thereafter, somehow, the
man felt much more secure in
his faith.

Surpassing strange, isn’t it?

I am glad to see that something
has finally been done about that
horrid Chaparral. Last Friday,
while eating the tuna fish tor
was it macaroni and cheese?)
that the University's Representa

about that Nasty Story. I was
terribly disturbed.
In the future the Chaparral
should slick to cartoons. Like the

Real Muslims Speak
We the undersigned, some of
the Muslim students at Stanford
University, have been questioned
by our fellow students and other
friends about what is known as
the “Black Muslim” movement
that seems to be gaining great
attention across the U.S. recently.
Our knowledge of this movement
is limited to what we have read
about it in the U.S. newspapers
and to what some of us have wit
nessed at a meeting of the group
in Philadelphia a few years ago.
We feel obligated to bring to the
attention of the.public the Islamic
point of view on certain principles
of fundamental importance. We
trust you will find this letter
worthy of publication.
One of the principles that has
been emphasized in Islam more
than in most other religions, we
believe, is that of racial equality.
Not only has tihs principle been
stressed in the Quran time and
time again but Islamic history
abounds in examples where this
rule has been put into practice.
The Holy Prophet Mohammed
himself was instrumental in
bringing about the marriage of
his cousin, Zainab daughter of
Jahsh, to Zaid who happened to
be a Negro. In the eyes of Islam
there is no black Muslim and no
white Muslim. If the followers of
the “Black Muslim” movement
profess to follow Islam, we would
like to remind them that the pol
icy of black supremacy or hatred
of the white is just as contrary,
to the spirit and the laws of Islam
as the hatred of the black race
by some whites in some parts of
the world.
We seem to feel that this move
ment is, at least to some extent,
politically oriented and we are
disturbed by the fact that the
name of the religion is being un
duly dragged into politics. As for
eign students our stay in this
country has been limited; but
from what little we have seen we
can only conclude that there is
lots of room left for improve
ment in the educational, economic
and social status of Negroes in
this country. It would, on the
other hand, be unfair if we did
not realize that great effort has
been made in this country in the
recent past to improve race rela
tions. With mutual understanding
and patience, we feel progress
would continue to be made.

We are happy to notice that
great transformation has taken
place in the personal lives of most
of the people who have joined
the “Black Muslim” movement;
They have become law abiding
citizens according to several

newspaper reports; they observe
rules of honesty and decency,,
they dress modestly and they I
pray regularly five times a day. j
This is indeed what Islam, among I
other things, enjoins upon its fol-'
lowers.
If Islam has been instrumental
in bringing about this happy
transformation, we are delighted
and we thank God for His love
and guidance. We feel assured
that if the followers of this move
ment observe the rules and the
spirit of Islam in its totality,
rather than in part, nobler and
greater glories await them atid
the racial equality they seem to
be striving for may eventually
be achieved in a non-violent and
peaceful manner because Islam,
as some of them seem to know,
is the religion of peace and sub
mission.

Unless Stanford students are I

student activity which interferes j
with the campaign to raise funds

the “bold” new programs of the

The Chaparral is not the only j

It Is inconceivable that the

The article of Editor Efron is

Once there was a man who had
a great and beautiful faith. He
believed in agreat savior whose
life and teachings were all re
corded in a great hook. And
among the teachings therein re
corded, there was one which said
one should pity the scoffers and
the disbelievers for they would
be condemned to eternal suffer
ing. And another said that if one’s
enemy struck one, one should
turn the other cheek. And in yet
another place this great savior
was quoted as saying: “Venge
ance is mine.”
Now one day this man found
himself beginning to doubt his
faith. And he became sore afraid
lest he lose his faith and be left
with no place to turn. And then
a scoffer appeared before him,
who laughed at his faith and
ridiculed it. Whereupon the man
rose up in towering rage and

Once there was a man who had
a great and beautiful faith. He
believed in agreat savior whose
life and teachings were all re
corded in a great hook. And
among the teachings therein re
corded, there was one which said
one should pity the scoffers and
the disbelievers for they would
be condemned to eternal suffer
ing. And another said that if one’s
enemy struck one, one should
turn the other cheek. And in yet
another place this great savior
was quoted as saying: “Venge
ance is mine.”
Now one day this man found
himself beginning to doubt his
faith. And he became sore afraid
lest he lose his faith and be left
with no place to turn. And then
a scoffer appeared before him,
who laughed at his faith and
ridiculed it. Whereupon the man
rose up in towering rage and
persecuted this scoffer unto his

Real Muslims Speak
We the undersigned, some of
the Muslim students at Stanford
University, have been questioned
by our fellow students and other
friends about what is known as
the “Black Muslim” movement
that seems to be gaining great
attention across the U.S. recently.
Our knowledge of this movement
is limited to what we have read
about it in the U.S. newspapers
and to what some of us have wit
nessed at a meeting of the group
in Philadelphia a few years ago.
We feel obligated to bring to the
attention of the.public the Islamic
point of view on certain principles
of fundamental importance. We
trust you will find this letter
worthy of publication.
One of the principles that has
been emphasized in Islam more
than in most other religions, we
believe, is that of racial equality.
Not only has tihs principle been
stressed in the Quran time and
time again but Islamic history
abounds in examples where this
rule has been put into practice.
The Holy Prophet Mohammed
himself was instrumental in
bringing about the marriage of
his cousin, Zainab daughter of
Jahsh, to Zaid who happened to
be a Negro. In the eyes of Islam
there is no black Muslim and no
white Muslim. If the followers of
the “Black Muslim” movement
profess to follow Islam, we would
like to remind them that the pol
icy of black supremacy or hatred
of the white is just as contrary,
to the spirit and the laws of Islam
as the hatred of the black race
by some whites in some parts of
the world.
We seem to feel that this move
ment is, at least to some extent,
politically oriented and we are
disturbed by the fact that the
name of the religion is being un
duly dragged into politics. As for
eign students our stay in this
country has been limited; but
from what little we have seen we
can only conclude that there is
lots of room left for improve
ment in the educational, economic
and social status of Negroes in
this country. It would, on the
other hand, be unfair if we did
not realize that great effort has
been made in this country in the
recent past to improve race rela
tions. With mutual understanding
and patience, we feel progress
would continue to be made.

We are happy to notice that
great transformation has taken
place in the personal lives of most
of the people who have joined
the “Black Muslim” movement;
They have become law abiding
citizens according to several

newspaper reports; they observe
rules of honesty and decency,,
they dress modestly and they I
pray regularly five times a day. j
This is indeed what Islam, among I
other things, enjoins upon its fol-'
lowers.
If Islam has been instrumental
in bringing about this happy
transformation, we are delighted
and we thank God for His love
and guidance. We feel assured
that if the followers of this move
ment observe the rules and the
spirit of Islam in its totality,
rather than in part, nobler and
greater glories await them atid
the racial equality they seem to
be striving for may eventually
be achieved in a non-violent and
peaceful manner because Islam,
as some of them seem to know,
is the religion of peace and sub

Unless Stanford students are I

Once there was a man who had
a great and beautiful faith. He
believed in agreat savior whose
life and teachings were all re
corded in a great hook. And
among the teachings therein re
corded, there was one which said
one should pity the scoffers and
the disbelievers for they would
be condemned to eternal suffer
ing. And another said that if one’s
enemy struck one, one should
turn the other cheek. And in yet
another place this great savior
was quoted as saying: “Venge
ance is mine.”
Now one day this man found
himself beginning to doubt his
faith. And he became sore afraid
lest he lose his faith and be left
with no place to turn. And then
a scoffer appeared before him,
who laughed at his faith and
ridiculed it. Whereupon the man
rose up in towering rage and
persecuted this scoffer unto his

Real Muslims Speak
We the undersigned, some of
the Muslim students at Stanford
University, have been questioned
by our fellow students and other
friends about what is known as
the “Black Muslim” movement
that seems to be gaining great
attention across the U.S. recently.
Our knowledge of this movement
is limited to what we have read
about it in the U.S. newspapers
and to what some of us have wit
nessed at a meeting of the group
in Philadelphia a few years ago.
We feel obligated to bring to the
attention of the.public the Islamic
point of view on certain principles
of fundamental importance. We
trust you will find this letter
worthy of publication.
One of the principles that has
been emphasized in Islam more
than in most other religions, we
believe, is that of racial equality.
Not only has tihs principle been
stressed in the Quran time and
time again but Islamic history
abounds in examples where this
rule has been put into practice.
The Holy Prophet Mohammed
himself was instrumental in
bringing about the marriage of
his cousin, Zainab daughter of
Jahsh, to Zaid who happened to
be a Negro. In the eyes of Islam
there is no black Muslim and no
white Muslim. If the followers of
the “Black Muslim” movement
profess to follow Islam, we would
like to remind them that the pol
icy of black supremacy or hatred
of the white is just as contrary,
to the spirit and the laws of Islam
as the hatred of the black race
by some whites in some parts of
the world.
We seem to feel that this move
ment is, at least to some extent,
politically oriented and we are
disturbed by the fact that the
name of the religion is being un
duly dragged into politics. As for
eign students our stay in this
country has been limited; but
from what little we have seen we
can only conclude that there is
lots of room left for improve
ment in the educational, economic
and social status of Negroes in
this country. It would, on the
other hand, be unfair if we did
not realize that great effort has
been made in this country in the
recent past to improve race rela
tions. With mutual understanding
and patience, we feel progress
would continue to be made.

We are happy to notice that
great transformation has taken
place in the personal lives of most
of the people who have joined
the “Black Muslim” movement;
They have become law abiding
citizens according to several

newspaper reports; they observe
rules of honesty and decency,,
they dress modestly and they I
pray regularly five times a day. j
This is indeed what Islam, among I
other things, enjoins upon its fol-'
lowers.
If Islam has been instrumental
in bringing about this happy
transformation, we are delighted
and we thank God for His love
and guidance. We feel assured
that if the followers of this move
ment observe the rules and the
spirit of Islam in its totality,
rather than in part, nobler and
greater glories await them atid
the racial equality they seem to
be striving for may eventually
be achieved in a non-violent and
peaceful manner because Islam,
as some of them seem to know,
is the religion of peace and sub
mission.

Unless Stanford students are I
to be condemned for having im

be achieved in a non-violent and
peaceful manner because Islam,
as some of them seem to know,
is the religion of peace and sub
mission.

Immoral Thoughts
Unless Stanford students are I
to be condemned for having im
moral thoughts or for making
these thoughts known to other
students, the only vice of the re
cent Chaparral parody is that its
inconsistency with the standard
of propriety to which society pur
portedly subscribes may offend
potential donors to the Univer-i
sity. The importance of limiting I
student activity which interferes j
with the campaign to raise funds
is indisputable, for without funds, i
the “bold” new programs of the
University can not be effectuated.
The Chaparral is not the only j
student activity having the po-1
tential to adversely affect Stan-1
ford’s public relations. Every stu-;
dent attempt to sponsor a con- [
troversial speaker, to espouse an j
unpopular opinion, or to sponsor 1
a program requiring funds from
outside sources has this poten- i
tial. To stifle this kind of activ-1
ity, as such activities frequently '
have been stifled in the past, is |
to warn students that original j
thinking which strays beyond the 1
bounds of propriety is not to be
tolerated. That official policy dis
courages independent student)
thinking is obvious when expul-1
sion becomes the penalty for ex
pressing thoughts contrary to an
undefinable standard of propri
ety.
It Is inconceivable that the
University’s public relations may
be maintained only by discourag
ing freedom of thought, a policy
which is antithetical to the high
est goals of any educational in
stitution. Would not Stanford
gain, even financially, from a rep

utatlon for promoting intellectual
development by providing a cli
mate which favors the free ex
pression of ideas?
I commend the Chaparral staff
for its humorous parody of Play
boy. It did not offend my sense
of propriety.

Bad Taste
Amid all the hullabaloo of the
latest issue of the Chappie, one
point should he kept clearly in
mind: the Chaparral is supposed
to be the campus humor maga
zine. If the Chappie serves its
purpose, it is a welcome part of
university life.
The question is: is the latest
Chappie humorous? In particu
lar, is the article of Editor Efron
a humorous one? Judgment
should be based upon this cri
terion.
The article of Editor Efron is
not humorous. Instead, it is but
a thinly-disguised attempt to rid
icule a Christian belief. The cheap
obscenity of the article is matched
only by the stupidity and had
taste of the editor. The university
officials should take the neces
sary step to insure that the next
issue of the Chaparral will be
humorous.

Vengeance
Once there was a man who had
a great and beautiful faith. He
believed in agreat savior whose
life and teachings were all re
corded in a great hook. And
among the teachings therein re
corded, there was one which said
one should pity the scoffers and
the disbelievers for they would
be condemned to eternal suffer
ing. And another said that if one’s
enemy struck one, one should
turn the other cheek. And in yet
another place this great savior
was quoted as saying: “Venge
ance is mine.”
Now one day this man found
himself beginning to doubt his
faith. And he became sore afraid
lest he lose his faith and be left
with no place to turn. And then
a scoffer appeared before him,
who laughed at his faith and
ridiculed it. Whereupon the man
rose up in towering rage and
persecuted this scoffer unto his
ruin. Thereafter, somehow, the
man felt much more secure in
his faith.

Surpassing strange, isn’t it?

Disturbed
I am glad to see that something
has finally been done about that
horrid Chaparral. Last Friday,
while eating the tuna fish tor
was it macaroni and cheese?)
that the University's Representa
tives provided for lunch. I thought
about that Nasty Story. I was
terribly disturbed.
In the future the Chaparral
should slick to cartoons. Like the
one on the bottom of page 29,
volume 62, number 2.

Ineptness
The brilliance of Mr. W. F.
Buckley’s debate was matched in
prominence only by the inept ness
which the panel displayed in ex
tracting the issues involved and
meeting the challenge that Mr.
Buckley presented. To bring in
an irrelevant point, this embar
rassing babbling by representa
tives of the Stanford faculty
should do more to undermine the
goals of the Pace Program, than
any number of “Layboys.”

Tombstones
Last night I dreamt I saw two
tombstones. One read “Efron
R.I.P signed Winbigler”; the
other re a d “Winbigler R.I.P.
signed God.” The carving on each
was identical.
