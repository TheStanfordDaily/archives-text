Curtice Has New System

This Saturday afternoon at 3:45 Stanford students and alums
alike will have a rhanee to look at a completely new Stanford football
team and a new system. Coach Jack Curtice leads a group of forty
odd players into a game with the talent-loaded alumni coached by
former Stanford gieats Clark Shaughnessy, who coached the famous
Indian Wow Boys to the 1941 Rose Bowl victory over Nebraska,
Frankie Albert and Chuck Taylor, who both played on that Rose Bowl
team and had distinguished coaching careers.
Curtice will present his new “spread split T” which, like his pre
decessor Taylor’s system, has the fullback carrying for most of the
line charges and the halfbacks specializing on wide plays. The “new”
Indians will have a few familiar faces in the line-up: notably guard
Tom Walsh, centers Chris Cottle and John Butler, tackle C. B.
Simons and quarterback Rod Sears. However Curtice states that
from his thirty-seven top gridders only six seniors and nine juniors
will see a lot of action this weekend with the bulk of the work com
ing from players on last-season’s top frosh team.

The game will give the Stan
ford team a good chance to play
against new faces and the alumni
will bo out to continue their domi
nation of the traditional Alumni-
Varsity spring clash.
This year’s alumni team will
have a few of last year’s stand
outs missing. Ends Bill McColl
and Chris Burford cannot make
the trip and also quarterback
John Brodie will he unable to suit
up.
However, this year’s team will
have former Stanford greats in
all positions. Coaches Shaugh
nessy, Albert and Taylor can
draw on such stars as: Carl Is
sues, Sam Morley or Jim Ukropina
from the end position; Noel Rob
inson, John Clark, Norm Manoo
gian at guards; Paul Wiggin, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee or Dean
Hinshaw at tackle; Doug Pursell

or John Thomas at center; Gary Kerkorian or Dick Norman at quar
terback; and Gordy Young, John Bond, Chuck Shea, Jack Taylor or
Mac Wylie at backfield positions. So it looks like the alumni many
of which are just one or two years out of playing will present an
experienced group of standouts for the young Stanford varsity to
do battle.
Alumni quarterback Dick Norman will join the other side in
Saturday’s contest as he played on the Varsity’s last two loosing
efforts. The big problem for the alumni according to Coach Taylor
will be to get his team together to work up a few plays before Satur
day’s game. He is worried that the afternoon and evening “socializ
ing” might hamper earnest alumni efforts in practice but vows that
all the “old men” will be up for Saturday’s friendly contest.
The Varsity has been holding workouts three times a week and
of course have been working on Curtice’s new system. They too
will have problems working into the new plays and Curtice will have
to decide who will get starting positions at quarterback Sears ap
pears to have the nod here and the rest of the backfield spots. They
should be ready to start the season with a win and avenge the last
two 23-14, and 29-28 defeats at the hands of the Brodie-led Alumni.

Alumni Will Be Ready

The Alumni too will be prepared they began practice Monday
night and continued yesterday, and for the remainder of the week
have strenuous sessions followed by “refreshments.”
So it looks like the Third Annual Alumni game should provide all
the color Stanford fans should want. There will be passing and run
ning in the usual Indian wide-open fashion, former Stanford All-
Americans will perform again, and any way you look at it, the game
will not be patterned after last season because this time a Stanford
team can’t lose.

efforts. The big problem for the alumni according to Coach Taylor
will be to get his team together to work up a few plays before Satur
day’s game. He is worried that the afternoon and evening “socializ
ing” might hamper earnest alumni efforts in practice but vows that
all the “old men” will be up for Saturday’s friendly contest.
The Varsity has been holding workouts three times a week and
of course have been working on Curtice’s new system. They too
will have problems working into the new plays and Curtice will have
to decide who will get starting positions at quarterback Sears ap
pears to have the nod here and the rest of the backfield spots. They
should be ready to start the season with a win and avenge the last
two 23-14, and 29-28 defeats at the hands of the Brodie-led Alumni.

Alumni Will Be Ready

The Alumni too will be prepared they began practice Monday
night and continued yesterday, and for the remainder of the week
have strenuous sessions followed by “refreshments.”
So it looks like the Third Annual Alumni game should provide all
the color Stanford fans should want. There will be passing and run
ning in the usual Indian wide-open fashion, former Stanford All-
Americans will perform again, and any way you look at it, the game
will not be patterned after last season because this time a Stanford
team can’t lose.

Curtice Has New System

This Saturday afternoon at 3:45 Stanford students and alums
alike will have a rhanee to look at a completely new Stanford football
team and a new system. Coach Jack Curtice leads a group of forty
odd players into a game with the talent-loaded alumni coached by
former Stanford gieats Clark Shaughnessy, who coached the famous
Indian Wow Boys to the 1941 Rose Bowl victory over Nebraska,
Frankie Albert and Chuck Taylor, who both played on that Rose Bowl
team and had distinguished coaching careers.
Curtice will present his new “spread split T” which, like his pre
decessor Taylor’s system, has the fullback carrying for most of the
line charges and the halfbacks specializing on wide plays. The “new”
Indians will have a few familiar faces in the line-up: notably guard
Tom Walsh, centers Chris Cottle and John Butler, tackle C. B.
Simons and quarterback Rod Sears. However Curtice states that
from his thirty-seven top gridders only six seniors and nine juniors
will see a lot of action this weekend with the bulk of the work com
ing from players on last-season’s top frosh team.

The game will give the Stan
ford team a good chance to play
against new faces and the alumni
will bo out to continue their domi
nation of the traditional Alumni-
Varsity spring clash.
This year’s alumni team will
have a few of last year’s stand
outs missing. Ends Bill McColl
and Chris Burford cannot make
the trip and also quarterback
John Brodie will he unable to suit
up.
However, this year’s team will
have former Stanford greats in
all positions. Coaches Shaugh
nessy, Albert and Taylor can
draw on such stars as: Carl Is
sues, Sam Morley or Jim Ukropina
from the end position; Noel Rob
inson, John Clark, Norm Manoo
gian at guards; Paul Wiggin, Eric
Protiva, Troy Barbee or Dean
Hinshaw at tackle; Doug Pursell

or John Thomas at center; Gary Kerkorian or Dick Norman at quar
terback; and Gordy Young, John Bond, Chuck Shea, Jack Taylor or
Mac Wylie at backfield positions. So it looks like the alumni many
of which are just one or two years out of playing will present an
experienced group of standouts for the young Stanford varsity to
do battle.
Alumni quarterback Dick Norman will join the other side in
Saturday’s contest as he played on the Varsity’s last two loosing
efforts. The big problem for the alumni according to Coach Taylor
will be to get his team together to work up a few plays before Satur
day’s game. He is worried that the afternoon and evening “socializ
