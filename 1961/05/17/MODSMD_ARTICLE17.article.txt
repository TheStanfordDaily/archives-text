## USC Hitters Lead CIBA Bat Stats 
### 
The USC Trojans, who have al
ready won the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association
championship, have also made an
impressive showing in the batting
statistics.
Larry Himes, who seems a
cinch to win the batting title with
a .440 average, heads a list of five
Trojans among the ten leading
CIBA batters.
JOHN lIURLBUT and Skip
Lawrence for Stanford, who hit
.317 and .309 respectively, were
seventh and eighth. Lawrence had
the same number of hits as Hurl
but, but his one extra time at bat
dropped him eight percentage
points behind.
With the Trojans having com
pleted their sixteen-game sched
ule, this weekend will see Califor
nia and UCLA battle it out for
second place, while Stanford and
Santa Clara will tangle for fourth
place.

California holds a one-game
edge over the Bruins and, after
playing Stanford Friday, will be
host to UCLA Saturday for a dou
bleheader.

The Cards, who hold a one
game advantage over Santa Clara,
will play a doubleheader Saturday
at Santa Clara to determine the
cellar dweller.
STANFORD, who climbed out
of last place last weekend by de
feating USC and Santa Clara
twice, will have to be in top form
again to hold back the Broncos
who are spoiling for revenge. A
Card defeat Friday against Cal
and a Santa Clara win over UCLA
would put everything on an equal
footing Saturday.
1 Just to prove the magic of sta
tistics Stanford could mathemati
cally tie UCLA for third place. If
UCLA, with 7 wins and 6 defeats,
was to lose all three of its games
this weekend, and Stanford, with
4 wins and 9 defeats, was to sweep
all three of its games, both teams
would have identical seven and
nine records. Just don’t count on
it!
