# Ousted Editor Hits Chappie Shutdown
## 
### 
Suspended Chappie editor Brad Efron took one last blast at the
administration and student leaders last night before departing for
home.

"If every time someone's judgement is labeled faulty by the
administration a first-rate campus institution is liquidated, we shall

soon be left only with the second
late,” Efron said.

“If the Chappie goes under, or
worse in my opinion, becomes a
fettered second-rate magazine, it
will be a serious loss to campus
life at Stanford,” Efron concluded.
EFRON’ denied that he was
apologetic over last week's issue
of the Chaparral, a parody on
Playboy which caused not only
his suspension but the suspension
of the publication for the rest of
the school year.

“The quotes and misquotes at
tributed to me have given the im
pression that I am terribly apolo
getic and contrite over last Wed
nesday’s Chaparral. This is not
the case.”

Despite this apparent, lack of
remorse, Efron said again last
night that he sent letters of apol
ogy two days ago to Chaplain
Robert Minto and Roman Catholic
Archbishop John J. Mitty.

IN A statement to the Daily
last night. Minto said that he had
not asked for an apology and that
none had been received.

Efron, in clarifying his attitude
toward his suspension, said, “I am
sorry that certain articles have
been misinterpreted as sacrilege
and smut, but oven my most se
vere critic. Dean Winbigler, ad
mits I have at worst acted out of
bad judgment, not bad intentions.
My judgment has resulted in my
suspension. But it has also re
sulted in the suspension of the
Chaparral, and this should be a
matter of concern for the whole
student body.”
IN another shotgun blast, Efron
struck out at student leaders for
"falling all over each other to fall
in line with the administration’s
position. What the Daily called a
‘Good Playboy Parody’ last week
is now ‘objectionable corner news
stand humor.’ What Legislature
felt was not deserving of censure
last week is not worth saving
from suspension now.
“By next week,” he concluded,
“another campus institution may
have been dragged down to LAS
SU mediocrity.”

life at Stanford,” Efron concluded.
EFRON’ denied that he was
apologetic over last week's issue
of the Chaparral, a parody on
Playboy which caused not only
his suspension but the suspension
of the publication for the rest of
the school year.

“The quotes and misquotes at
tributed to me have given the im
pression that I am terribly apolo
getic and contrite over last Wed
nesday’s Chaparral. This is not
the case.”

Despite this apparent, lack of
remorse, Efron said again last
night that he sent letters of apol
ogy two days ago to Chaplain
Robert Minto and Roman Catholic
Archbishop John J. Mitty.

IN A statement to the Daily
last night. Minto said that he had
not asked for an apology and that
none had been received.

Efron, in clarifying his attitude
toward his suspension, said, “I am
sorry that certain articles have
been misinterpreted as sacrilege
and smut, but oven my most se
vere critic. Dean Winbigler, ad
mits I have at worst acted out of
bad judgment, not bad intentions.
My judgment has resulted in my
suspension. But it has also re
sulted in the suspension of the
Chaparral, and this should be a
matter of concern for the whole
student body.”
IN another shotgun blast, Efron
struck out at student leaders for
"falling all over each other to fall
in line with the administration’s
position. What the Daily called a
‘Good Playboy Parody’ last week
is now ‘objectionable corner news
stand humor.’ What Legislature
felt was not deserving of censure
last week is not worth saving
from suspension now.
“By next week,” he concluded,
“another campus institution may
have been dragged down to LAS
SU mediocrity.”
Suspended Chappie editor Brad Efron took one last blast at the
administration and student leaders last night before departing for
home.

"If every time someone's judgement is labeled faulty by the
administration a first-rate campus institution is liquidated, we shall

soon be left only with the second
late,” Efron said.

“If the Chappie goes under, or
worse in my opinion, becomes a
fettered second-rate magazine, it
will be a serious loss to campus
life at Stanford,” Efron concluded.
