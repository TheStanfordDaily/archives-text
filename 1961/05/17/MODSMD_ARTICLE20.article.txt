man.
Stanford's winning Indian baseballers scrambled to their fifth
straight triumph with a 3-2 win over the San Diego Marines yester
day at Sunken Diamond.
Jim Smith and Darrell Sutherland split the mound chores, with
Smith going the first five innings and Sutherland the last four. Both

pitchers were sharp, as the two
Marine runs were unearned.
Smith gave up four hits and j
struck out four in his stint, while
Sutherland allowed three hits and
struck out five.
San Diego scored first, with an
unearned tally in the first inning.
Leadoff hitter Hap Mays went to
second on thirdbaseman Rich Fer
razzano’s throwing error and
scored on Marine shortstop John
Spadoni’s single.
Stanford second sacker Mike
Magee saved Smith further
trouble with a diving grab in
back of second base that saved
two more runs.

Stanford tied it in the bottom
of the first inning when Hal
Schutzman walked, stole second
base, and scored on John Hurl
hut’s triple off the right-center
field bank.
The Indians went ahead to stay
in the fourth inning. Ferrazzano
opened the stanza with a single,
but was thrown out at the plate
attempting to score on Magee’s
double. Magee went to third on
the throw that nailed Ferrazzano
and scored when a throw by Ma
rine catcher Bill Lister hit him
on the leg and went down the
third base line.

Magee scored Stanford’s last
run in the bottom of the eighth
inning. He tripled and scored on
Joel Shulman’s single under the
shortstop’s glove into left field.

The Marines picked up another
run in the ninth on an infield

single, an error and a squeeze
hunt, but Sutherland struck, out
the last man to end the game.
The Indians’ top performers
were Magee with a double and
triple and II u r1 b u t, who also
doubled and tripled.
