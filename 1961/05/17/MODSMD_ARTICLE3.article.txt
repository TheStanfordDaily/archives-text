# Grafting Is Topic Of Holman Talk

Dr. Halsted R. Holman, execu
tive head of the Stanford Depart
ment of Medicine, and professor
at the Medical School, discussed
the progress of “Transplantation
of Human Tissues” last evening
at the Tuesday Evening Series
program.
In the past, tissues grafted
from one organism to another
have turned white after a period
and fallen off. The host’s immune
response to the graft was found
the cause of this phenomenon.
“TWO aspects of hypersensi
tivity,” he explained in description
of the host’s immunological reac
tion, are the immediate, antibody
response, and the delayed, cellu
lar response.
In the first example, a protein
produced by the host combines
with and neutralizes the invading
antigon. The antibody formed,
which is transferred through
plasma, causes the graft to fall
off.
THE host's reaction to a first
invasion of foreign material ap
pears in about twelve to fourteen
days, but to a second in perhaps
six hours, ho said, due to the
“memory response” of an organ
ism.
A sensitivation of the host’s
tells, which is transferred by
w'hitc blood cells rather than
plasma, occurs in cellular re
sponse, he added.
“The thing to do ... is to in
hibit the immune response of the
host.” ho said. The problem is to
build immunological tolerance,
for instance by radiation, without
destroying the organism’s ability
to combat other bacteria.
“We have the potential capacity
for selectively preventing the
host’s reaction to the graft,” he
concluded.
