# Elect Dierdorff ICC President
## 
### 
Dave Dierdorff of Breakers has
been elected President of the In
ter-Club Council for the next aca
demic year as the successor to
Bob Wood.
Dierdorff polled 152 votes
whereas his opponent, Gerry
Glancy of El Toro, drew 142
voles. This election was held last
Monday night to resolve the tie
that resulted from the first final
election on (he previous Monday.
IN THAT election each candi
date had received 131 votes. The
election for vice-president ended
at that time in a clear victoiy for
Frank Wallace of Los Arcos over
Bill Sharp of El Tigre.
The new president thinks that
“the clubs are more in keeping
with what w'e think the univer
sity wants in a living group sys
tem in that they arc an extension
of the educational process.’’
DIERDORFF said, "I would
like to reevaluate the clubs’ rush
ing program to bring it into closer
correlation with the philosophy of
the eating clubs. Rushing should
he more informal and should
spread over a longer period of
time so that we don’t judge a
rushee by how many beers he
can down.”
