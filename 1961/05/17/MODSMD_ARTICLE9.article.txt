# Korea General Defies U.S. --Arrests Cabinet Members
## New Strongman Promises Fast Creation Of New Government 
### 
SEOUL, Korea—UPl—Republic of Korea troops who seized the
government on Tuesday dug trenches and set up machine gun posi
tions north of Seoul yesterday as an apparent precaution against
attack by counter-revolutionary forces.
There was no indication that such an attack was imminent. But

tanks which guarded Seoul streets
Tuesday left the city and moved
north yesterday to the defense po
sitions.
The nation’s new military
strongman, Gen. Chang Do Yung,
pledged restoration of civil gov
ernment as soon as his forces
sweep away all vestiges of the
fallen governemnt of Premier
John M. Chang. The former gov
ernment still had support of the j
United States.
THE DEFENSE positions were |
dug a few miles north of Seoul on i
the road to Uijongbu and to the
area where the bulk of Korea’s
fighting forces are deployed.
Gen. Chang, who is not related |
to deposed Premier Chang, con-1
tinned efforts to organize a new |
government. There were uncon
firmed reports that among poli
ticians contacted by the revolu
tionary group was Pyun Yung
Tai, former premier and former i
foreign minister.
Pyun, generally considered one I
of the most honest politicians in |
Korea, is an English professor at
Seoul University.
GEN. CHANG made his vow to
restore civil government during a
radio broadcast Tuesday shortly
after leaders of the revolutionary j
junta had President Posun Yun
make a radio appeal for Premier
Chang to emerge from hiding and
surrender.
The general dissolved parlia
ment and began arresting cabinet
members.
Premier Chang and his demo
cratic party had been under in
creasing fii'e for failure to solve
the nation’s economic ills, for cor- j
ruption, for factional bickering
and for what some persons con- 1
sidered a soft attitude toward j
communism.
The general said in his broad- i
cast that corruption had increased !
during the past year and that the i
people were undergoing hard- (
ships.
SEOUL NEWSPAPERS gener
ally supported the military coup,|
although in varying degrees of en-1
thusiasm. The general opinion j
seemed to be that it was too bad |
this had In happen, hut that some- j
thing had to be done. J

Newspapers urged that the rev
olutionary commit tee return
power to civil authorities as soon
as possible.
One of the largest newspapers,
Donga Ilbo, asked Premier Chang
and his government to accept re
sponsibility for the situation and
resign, “thereby expressing its
sincerity in apologizing to the
people.’’
The English-language Korean
Republic, a government-controlled
newspaper, expressed some of the
most severe critiicsm of Premier
Chang.
“The present crisis has arisen,”
it said, “not because the hopes of
the people were too high after the
April (I960) revolution, but be
cause the achievements of the
government were too few.”
The streets of Seoul were de
serted tonight because of the
strictly enforced curfew. There
were no demonstrations in the
capital as had been claimed in a
Communist broadcast from North
Korea.

The nation’s new military
strongman, Gen. Chang Do Yung,
pledged restoration of civil gov
ernment as soon as his forces
sweep away all vestiges of the
fallen governemnt of Premier
John M. Chang. The former gov
ernment still had support of the j
United States.
THE DEFENSE positions were |
dug a few miles north of Seoul on i
the road to Uijongbu and to the
area where the bulk of Korea’s
fighting forces are deployed.
Gen. Chang, who is not related |
to deposed Premier Chang, con-1
tinned efforts to organize a new |
government. There were uncon
firmed reports that among poli
ticians contacted by the revolu
tionary group was Pyun Yung
Tai, former premier and former i
foreign minister.
Pyun, generally considered one I
of the most honest politicians in |
Korea, is an English professor at
Seoul University.
GEN. CHANG made his vow to
restore civil government during a
radio broadcast Tuesday shortly
after leaders of the revolutionary j
junta had President Posun Yun
make a radio appeal for Premier
Chang to emerge from hiding and
surrender.
The general dissolved parlia
ment and began arresting cabinet
members.
Premier Chang and his demo
cratic party had been under in
creasing fii'e for failure to solve
the nation’s economic ills, for cor- j
ruption, for factional bickering
and for what some persons con- 1
sidered a soft attitude toward j
communism.
The general said in his broad- i
cast that corruption had increased !
during the past year and that the i
people were undergoing hard- (
ships.
SEOUL NEWSPAPERS gener
ally supported the military coup,|
although in varying degrees of en-1
thusiasm. The general opinion j
seemed to be that it was too bad |
this had In happen, hut that some- j
thing had to be done. J

Newspapers urged that the rev
olutionary commit tee return
power to civil authorities as soon
as possible.
One of the largest newspapers,
Donga Ilbo, asked Premier Chang
and his government to accept re
sponsibility for the situation and
resign, “thereby expressing its
sincerity in apologizing to the
people.’’
The English-language Korean
Republic, a government-controlled
newspaper, expressed some of the
most severe critiicsm of Premier
Chang.
“The present crisis has arisen,”
it said, “not because the hopes of
the people were too high after the
April (I960) revolution, but be
cause the achievements of the
government were too few.”
The streets of Seoul were de
serted tonight because of the
strictly enforced curfew. There
were no demonstrations in the
capital as had been claimed in a
Communist broadcast from North
Korea.
SEOUL, Korea—UPl—Republic of Korea troops who seized the
