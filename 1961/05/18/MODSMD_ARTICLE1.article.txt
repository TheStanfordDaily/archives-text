# Chappie Staffers Propose Reforms For Reinstatement
## 
### MAUREEN STRAIN 
The Hammer and Coffin Society met last night to take a long,
hard look at itself.
Editor Brad Efron, suspended last week along with the Chapar
ral, presided over the meeting. They were there, he said, not to de
cide whether or not the Chappie staff had done something wrong in
publishing the controversial "Layboy" issue.
Instead, they had to agree upon some positive steps to reinstate
the Chappie on campus. "We definitely have to do something,"

Efron Insisted.
THE SOCIETY resolved to live
up in the future to the letter of
its 1952 constitution which gives
the Society, as publisher of the
Chaparral, the veto power over
material submitted by staff and
editorial board members.
Subject to administration ap
proval, the new scheme for in
suring a magazine in good taste,
okayed by the official publishing
group, Hammer and Coffin, will
be to submit the proofs of Ihe
magazine to a committee, repre
senting the Society, consisting of
Ihe paid editorial staff, in suffi
cient time before the date of pub
lication to cancel or alter any
material found objectionable.
This year. Hammer and Coffin
spokesmen Nick Shoumatoff and
Sandy Gallun told the Daily, one
situation contributing to the
Chappie’s problems was that
Hammer and Coffin has not been
so integrally connected with the
magazine’s editorial content as
befitted the publishers of a mag
azine.

THE EMPHASIZED that the
Society has the power to repri
mand and overrule the decisions
of the magazine’s editor. The edi
tor is to lie elected by the society
from its membership, a rule not
followed strictly in Efron’s case.
The Society hopes “to set the
sights of the magazine a little
higher,” said Shoumatoff, to pro
duce genuinely humorous mate
rial which might deal with any
subject, but avoid doing it in an
offensive way.
“NO ONE IX Hammer and
Coffin wants to see the magazine
off campus.” said Gallun,
Meanwhile, the San Jose State
College Spartan Daily reported
on Tuesday that the manager of
San Jose’s Spartan Bookstore,
Harry J. VVineroth, had this to
say about the “Layboy” issue:
"We took one look at the maga
zine and shipped all 300 copies
right back up there in the same
boxes they arrived in. That was
the filthiest thing I ever read.”
DEAN WINBIGLER had com
mented earlier, “I think a deci
sion has to be reached this next
two weeks in order to guarantee
a Chappie for next fall. We have
to got rolling.”
The Chappie staff began to take
steps in this direction last night.
At the same time, measures are
being taken to strengthen the
Public Relations Board. Ed Cut
ter, administrative assistant to
the president, explained the diffi
culties involved in promoting stu
dent responsibility through such
a board.
IT SHOULD be free from po
litical control, he said, and at the
same time not a censorship board.
It should assume some responsi
bility for student publications,
but can not take final responsi
bility from the editors, Cutter
said.
Suggestions have been made to
have professors on Pub Rel as
well as students, and to encour
age editors to use it as an ad
visory board.
Pub Rel, officers of the ASSU,
and the student publications
themselves are getting together
to develop something, Cutter said,
and some definite decision will
have to be reached lief ore the
end of this quarter.
