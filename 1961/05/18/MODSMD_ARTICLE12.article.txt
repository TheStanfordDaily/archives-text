# Mr. Nixon Returns To Political Arena
## 
### 
The first 100 days of the Kennedy administration have passed.
They have seen the country's political temperature return to normal
after experiencing a brief siege of Kennedy fever. The President has
suffered major defeats in foreign relations and tasted only the nar
rowest of domestic successes. Through all this the President has
continued to call for sacrifices on the part of the people, while send
ing minimum wage bills, depressed area bills, and agricultural bills
to the Congress. The President's actions have brought forth the nerv
ous suggestion from his anxious supporters, among them Mr. James
Reston of the New York Times, that "Maybe the President is right
that the people will not make the effort and sacrifices necessary, but
nobody will know until he asks not what the people are going to do
for their country, but indicate to them what he wants them to do."
In contrast to Mr. Kennedy's performance has been the readjust
ment of Mr. Nixon to his role as private lawyer and spokesman for
the loyal opposition. In these roles he has shown both wisdom and
foresight. While he justifiably criticized Secretary Udall for the lat
ter's statement which attempted to say the Cuban fiasco was all the
fault of the Eisenhower administration, he has kept silent on other
matters in order to maintain national unity. He did this, in spite of the
fresh memory of the victor's blatant and unqualified charges that he
would correct the failures of President Eisenhower.
More important, Mr. Nixon has been busily at work within his
party, rebuilding grass roots organization, finding appealing candi
dates for local and state offices, and beginning a speaking tour which
will summarize his three-month leave of absence.
This absence has seen Mr. Nixon briefly retire from the public
scene for a well-earned vacation and now his return to the political
battlefront. It is good to have him back.
