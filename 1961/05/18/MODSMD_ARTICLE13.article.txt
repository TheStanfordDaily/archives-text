## U.S. Should Settle For Neutralized Laos 
### 
With the Secretary of State at
Geneva worrying about the inter
nal politics of Laos and with the
Vice President doing a whirlwind
tour of Southeast Asia, it may be
useful to try if we can to see the
American involvement in its his
torical perspective.

Laos and South]
Vietnam are two
fragments thej
other two being;
Communist?
North Vietnam;
and neutralist)
Cambodia of
what used to be
the French colo-l
nial empire of (
Indo-China. Ja-:
pan overran this

empire after the collapse of
France in 1940, and although the
empire was restored to France
after the Japanese surrender in
.1945, the defeat of a Western by
an Asian power had, as the event
proved, fatally destroyed the pres
tige of France.
DURING the Japanese occupa
tion the Communist - Nationalist
Viet-Minh gathered force, and if
it had not been opposed from out
side Vietnam, would have con
trolled the country. A French Ex
peditionary Corps fought the
Viet-Minh from 1945 to 1954, un
til the costly war was ended by
the Geneva agreement of 1954.
By 1953, in the first year of
President Eisenhower’s adminis
tration, it had become plain that
the French were losing the Indo-
Chinese war. At the turn of the
year Secretary Dulles realized
that French power was doomed,
and that only intervention by the
United States could prevent the
whole of Indo-China from falling
into the hands of the Communists,
backed by Red China. It was at
this critical juncture that Mr.
Dulles proclaimed the celebrated
doctrine of “Massive retaliations.”

The immediate and primary
purpose of his speech was not, as
has often been said, to save
money, to balance the budget, to
get “a bigger bank for a buck.”
The purpose of Mr. Dulles’s
speech was to protect the frag
ments of the Indo-Chinese empire
against Communist domination
without involving American
troops in another Korean war.
This will be clear to anyone who
reads the speech in the light of
our current troubles. Mr. Dulles
said, for example, that “it is not
sound military strategy perma
nently to commit United States
land forces to Asia to a degree
that leaves us no strategic re
serves.”
THK. DULLES policy, then, was
to protect Indo-China by the
threat of dropping nuclear bombs
on China or Russia or both. In
1954 this was a workable policy.
For while the Soviet Union had
broken our nuclear monopoly in
1949, in 1954 it was just about to

master the hydrogen bomb and it
had no missile force comparable
with the bombers of the American
Strategic Air Force. The United
States was then the paramount
military power in the world, and
where it chose to exert its power,
its word was law.

There are some among us who
think that Laos and Vietnam
could be defended by the threat
of opening an American front for
another Korean war. They think
that Mr. Khrushchev can be in
timidated. They are mistaken.
Eisenhower and Dulles were in a
position to use the threat of nu
clear weapons because they had a
monopoly of nuclear weapons.
But Kennedy and Rusk cannot
threaten to fight a land war be
cause the Chinese and the Soviets
are overwhelmingly superior to
any land forces we could engage.
Our threat to fight another Ko
rean war would be bluff which
would immediately be called. If
we were to send a brigade of Ma
rines into South Vietnam, the Chi
nese would have no trouble at all
in sending two brigades into
North Vietnam.

WHAT THEN can Mr. Kennedy
do? Since he cannot defend the
old Indo-China by massive retalia
tions or by committing land
forces, he must do what he has
been trying to do in Laos since he
took office. He must do what the
British and the French and the
Indians want him to do. He must
try to induce the Soviet Union and
Red China to settle for a “neu
tralization,” that is to say, an
agreement by the great powers
not lo fight the cold war by proxy
inside Laos. Almost certainly it
will not be a satisfying arrange
ment. But does anyone know of a
better alternative?

We should, I feel, look upon all
this with a certain philosophy. As
a result of the defeat of both
France and Japan in Indo-China
we became, without in the least
wishing it, the heirs, or let us say,
the receivers, of the collapsed and
broken Indo-Chinese empire. Since
the end of the World War, espe
cially since 19154, we have, with
out enjoying any of the benefits
of empire, experienced all its
costs, risks, and frustrations.

This process of liquidation and
replacement is one that any ad
ministration — it happens to be
the Kennedy administration —
would now have to be engaged in.
The administration should engage
itself candidly, boldly, and con
structively, rising above the pres
ent small preoccupations of Mr.
Rusk and Mr. Johnson, to a pro
posal for a regional system of in
dependence and security and neu
trality for the old colonial lands of
South Asia.
This would be a very good sub
ject for the President to talk
about with Mr. Khrushchev.
