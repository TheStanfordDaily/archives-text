Sacred Cow
Difficult as it is mourn Layboy
Efron’s demise when still laugh
ing at the most genuinely funny
Chappie in many years, one can
wonder about the circumstances
surrounding his departure. It is
a badge of heroism of sorts to
be suspended from college for
publishing a “highly objection
able” humor magazine. But it
seems that a substantial part of
all the fuss was caused by Lay
boy’s lack of respect for Religion
in general and that sacred cow,
the Virgin Birth Story, in par
ticular.

The fact is that officials of the
Catholic Church made general
and specific, vociferous and indig
nant objection to Layboy’s Un
healthy and Erroneous religious
columns. The clergy’s objections
were both predictable and under
standable. The University’s reac
tion may have been predictable,
but it is far from understandable.
I find Dean Winbigler’s denial
that University action resulted
from Church protests unconvinc
ing, particularly when his state
ments immediately after publica
tion of the Chappie contained no
hint of disciplinary action.
More important, what is the
significance of the Dean’s Chris
tian Act for the rest of us? Is it
now wrong to criticize religious
myths in student publications?
Or only Wrong to parody them?
Wrong to lampoon the Church in
University buildings? No one
doubts that the Chappie could
laugh at the superstitions of Ama
zon River headhunters, the be
liefs of the Black Muslims, or, a
closer case, fundamentalist Prot
estant Bible pounders. If this is
so, where does Dean Winbigler
draw his line? Apparently at the
size, power, and wealth of the
offended group.
I wish Dean Winbigler or the
President would reassure us that
our Menckenisms or, more accu
rately, our Efronisms will not be
subject to a gentle inquisition
when the totems of a Big Church
are involved.
ROBERT FISHER
Responsible

In regard to the recent Chapar
ral incident, I have several com
ments to make aobut the implied
publication policy of Stanford as
implemented by Dean Winbigler.
First, although the editor can
be said to be responsible for his
publication, it seems rather ridic
ulous that the publication be held
responsible for its e d i t or. The
suspension of the publication
may, in the idiom, of the armed
services, be construed as “com
pany punishment,” but that
hardly befits the dignity of this
University.

Second, the University should
either assent to independence of
student publications or exercise
direct control. If its student pub
lications are said to represent
Stanford, then a member of the
administration should have edi
torial control.

Third, if the University would
shed itself of potentially embar
rassing publications, it should
specify that all student publica
tions be under the control of
completely independent student
corporations. If it still wished to
facilitate such publications, cost
type arrangements may be made
on equipment, supplies, and hous
ing. Such policies exist or have
existed at Harvard and Wiscon
sin.

It seems to me that these com
ments can be considered apart
from any judgment on the con
tent oft he disputed issue of Chap
arral.

Protesting

The most careless examination
of the Daily’s front page treat
ment of the Chappie-Efron affair
(May 16, 1961) reveals an obvi
ous example of slanted reporting.
The first two words of the head
line are no doubt intended to jolt
the reader’s mind at once into
indignation with the slogan, Re
ligious Pressure. (One sure to
succeed in arousing the desired
effect because of the wide popu
larity it has enjoyed in recent
national isues.) This neat little
psychological trick is followed by
still stronger words: Clerics Blast
‘Layboy’ and again, Religion the
Issue. Finally, in true TV com
mercial form, the headline slogan
is repeated in the opening sen
tence of the lead paragraph. By
this time the unwary reader’s
mind has been so psychologically
framed that it can do nothing but

elicit sympathy for the individual
(obviously persecuted to judge
from his facial expression ) whose
picture appears immediately un
der the headlines designedly, of
course.

I would now like to join the
ranks of those whose main de
light is to indulge in what seems
to be one of the most popular
pastimes nowadays, protesting.
I protest such obviously biased
reporting. Furthermore I protest
in advance against all those who
will inevitably protest that in this
affair an individual was unjustly
or unduly penalized through cen
sorship and suspension in a case
involving freedom of expression.
Freedom of expression, like all
freedoms, is a right. But there
is no such thing as an unlimited
right. All rights are limited by
concomitant obligations which
are the bases for the distinction,
often overlooked, between free
dom and license. In the case at
hand an obligation, in the form
of respect for the religious be
liefs of others, was clearly and
blatantly ignored. Or does it mat
ter that in an official publication
of the Stanford students, what is
to millions one of the most sacred
and profound beliefs, was crudely
parodied and disgustingly trave
stied? Thanks to University offi
cials such a mockery was not
allowed to go unpunished. I am
certain there are some who would
reflect more than once whether
or not they would want a degree
from an institution which would
allow such an insult to pass with
out punishment.

Sorry for Faculty

I trust that the souls of the
local clergy, and of the admin
istration of this university, are
salved by the action taken against
the editor of the Chaparral. In
wielding the cudgel of suspension
the Trustees have no doubt
struck a telling blow in the eter
nal battle against evil. They have
demonstrated their fearlessness
in the face of all the malign
forces of this world —and more
particularly of this university—
and the Stanford student will
take their example to heart. They
are to be lauded for their high
mindedness and their community
spirit.
But by other than myself. I
am low-minded and I have no
community spirit. The stench of
my morals smothers my desire
to take a place among the ranks
of those good people who are
blessed with such a sure percep
tion of the malignity and the evil
which constantly threatens the
equanimity of their community.
I thank God that there are people
in this world with enough forti
tude to crush evil whenever and
wherever it rears its ugly head.
Without them, I would surely be
lost.
I haven’t the guts to praise
them, though, because they
might, with their acute intuition,
recognize the evil in me, too. I
dont’ want to be crushed. I feel
sorry for the editor of the Chap
pie, my Satanic comrade. I also
feel sorry for the faculty adviser
who let this happen to him.

Poor Text Nixed
Having just completed my sec
ond quarter of freshman chem
istry, I would like to make a com
ment on the textbook we were
required to use. It is a hew book,
written by a member of the Stan
ford chemistry department, Dr.
Hutchinson, and is used by a
large number of beginning chem
istry students, including those for
whom chemistry will be a major.
Acknowledging my relative un
familiarity with college text
books, I feel, and several people
agree with me, that this is a very
poor book.
My primary reason for saying
so is that the book is extremely
difficult to read, not because the
author seems to feel that a flow
ery writing style is more impor
tant than a clear and concise
presentation. For instance, “His
tory provided the man | Mende
leev] with felicitous chronological
appropriateness,” is a typical sen
tence. Even if the reader is able
to keep awake, he cannot help
missing a great deal of important
information, buried as it is in this
unnecessary wordiness. There is
a difference between adding life
to a subject such as chemistry,
and sacrificing a rigorous and
clear presentation of important
concepts for monotonous and trite
verbal garbage. In direct contrast
is the new Physics 51 textbook,
which is not only lively and inter
esting but also very thorough and
precise in its treatment of me
chanics.
I realize that a new textbook
must be tested out on the “home
campus,” hut not, I should hope,
at the expense of hundreds of
students for whom it represents
an initial encounter with college
chemistry.

On Classics

In reference to Bill Webb’s let
ter in Wednesday’s Daily, I would
like to point out that the writer
of that letter, in his vitriolic burst
of self-righteous indignation, has
not seen, or chosen to ignore, the
very purpose of the article in
question, the “Ribald Classic.”

Each month, Playboy takes an
old and respected piece of liter
ature, and “translates” it to make
it appear as suggestive and lewd
as possible. Brad took an old and
respected piece of literature (and
who can deny that the Bible is
one of the oldest and most re
spected?) and “translated” it to
achieve the above effect. The ar
ticle is not, as Webb says, “a
thinly-disguised attempt to ridi
cule the Christian belief,” but
rather a rather violent attack on
Playboy. The article, if viewed
in the context of the magazine,
makes absolutely no religious
statement at all.

The question of whether or not
the article was funny is a matter
of opinion. I thought it was funny,
along with many of my friends,
and apparently many people did
not, but we have had many un
funny Chappies before without
firing the editor.
