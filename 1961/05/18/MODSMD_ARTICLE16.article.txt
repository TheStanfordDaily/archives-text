The Dull Black and White
The dull black and white of such things as seasonal records and
statistics often hide the true worth of a team, or at least under
estimate it, as is the case with Stanford’s varsity track squad this
year. The Indians have won only three dual meets this season while
losing nine, but these numbers don’t indicate that the teams they've
met have been the finest in the nation. San Jose State, USC, UCLA.,
Oregon, and Oregon State will undoubtedly rate among the top at
the close of (he season when all the so-called experts make their
infallible Judgments.

A more accurate indication of the material on Coacli Payton
Jordan’s team perhaps lies in the fact that it attracted 14 bids from
the Northern California Invitational Track and Field Meet. This
classic, to be held at Freemont High School in Sunnyvale Saturday,
will draw the cream of Northern California track talent including
armed services and unattached amateurs in addition to the excep
tionally strong college field.

* PERHAPS the most interesting
race of the evening will be the 880
where Stanford’s Rich Klier will
run up against one of the fastest
fields put together this year. The
competition will come from an
other of Jordan’s proteges, Ernie
Cunliffe, who holds the Stanford
record with a 1:47.3. The former
Card daptain has been working
hard for the big spring meets and
should be close to top form. Last
weekend he turned a 4:02.5 mile
in the West Coast Relays, which
was good enough for second.
Also in the field will be an old
Stanford nerrtesis Jerry Siebert
who competed for Cal in his un
dergraduate days. Siebert was a
member of the 1900 Olympic team,
as was Cunliffe, and has a 1:46.9
clocking to his credit.
To round out the field Santa
Clara Youth Village will enter

Jim Beatty, the American mile record holder and Larry Means, who
had the best time in the nation last year representing the Air Force.
THE DISCI'S field shapes up to be the finest assembled this year
with five men having gone over 170 feet. Dave Weill, who broke
the Stanford record as a sophomore this year with a heave of 175
feet, will be joined by teammate Don Bell in their quest against the
nation’s finest. Opposing them will be Dan Studney of San Jose
State, and Jay Sylvester and Jack Egan of Santa Clara Youth Village
all members of the magic 170-foot club.
Art Batchelder, a consistent winner all year for the Indians, will
run up against the stiffest competition he’s faced this year when he
encounters a brilliant field headed by former Card great Leo Long.
Long still holds the Stanford record which he set in 1954 at 235-9%.
Batchelder has threatened that mark but as yet has not exceeded
233-3. The hefty junior is rated third on the coast and fifth nation
ally in his event.
Phil White, who has been a pleasant surprise for Jordan this year
blossoming out as a sophomore to break the school pole vault record
with a 14-4lt mark, will have a severe test in store for him. He faces
the finest three-man team in the country in San Jose State’s Dick
Kemmill, Dick Gear, and Jeff Chase. Kimmell who rates as the
favorite, cleared 15-1% just last weekend.
Some Promising Freshmen
A NUMBER of promising freshmen were also deemed worthy to
compete in the Invitational by the selection board. Bill Pratt re
ceived bids in two events, the SBO and mile where he holds the Stan
ford frosh records. Pratt will pass tip the mile to concentrate on the
shorter distance. He will not be thrown into the same heat with
Klier, Cunliffe, Siebert & Co. but will be joined by varsity star Rich
Parker in a more bearable field. Pratt cracked Klier’s old frosh mark
with a 1.53 against the San Jose State freshman earlier this year.
The mile should pose an interesting duel between two outstanding
freshman stars, Ben Tucker of the Spartans anti Robin Ruble of
Stanford. Recognized as the two best in the high school ranks last
year, they met twice, each winning one of the encounters. Tucker
prevailed earlier this year when the two power-packed freshman
teams vied, and Ruble has been anxiously awaiting the chance to
even (he score again. Both yearlings will have to contend with Fred
Abbingtion, the SCYV star.
RICH CHESEREK is the only Stanford entrant who will double,
going in the 220 and 440. Cheserek tied the standing frosh record
this year at 21.6 and has been a consistent winner in the 440 for the
undefeated squad. In the 220 he may be a little over his head with
such names as Doug Johnson, SJS; Willie White, formerly of Cali
fornia; Don Ramos, SJS; and Keith Thomassen, SCYV lined up
against him. In the 440 he’ll face Thomassen. whose 46.1 is the fastest
time this year, and such established stars as Ramos and Jack Yer
man, an ex-Trojan now competing for SCYV.
Steve Arch in the Shot
In the shot freshman star Steve Arch will match heaves with the
Stanford record holder Jerry Winters who was out to 59-11 last year.
He will wear SCYV colors Saturday. These two will got plenty of
competition from Sylvester and Dave Maggard, the California cham
pion.
YEARLING Steve Cortright will meet with another ex-Stanford
great Chuck Cobb in the high hurdles. Cobb was captain of the 1958
team and broke the school mark then with a 13.9 performance. That
record still stands. Cortright. is perhaps the greatest threat to Cobb’s
niche in the record book, having turned a 14.7 this year and showing
steady improvement.
All -.things considered the Invitational will bo one of the true
classics of the '6l track season, rivaling the Coliseum Relays whose
place it lakes on the Stanford schedule. And what better tribute to
a team than strong recognition in these circles.

with five men having gone over 170 feet. Dave Weill, who broke
the Stanford record as a sophomore this year with a heave of 175
feet, will be joined by teammate Don Bell in their quest against the
nation’s finest. Opposing them will be Dan Studney of San Jose
State, and Jay Sylvester and Jack Egan of Santa Clara Youth Village
all members of the magic 170-foot club.
Art Batchelder, a consistent winner all year for the Indians, will
run up against the stiffest competition he’s faced this year when he
encounters a brilliant field headed by former Card great Leo Long.
Long still holds the Stanford record which he set in 1954 at 235-9%.
Batchelder has threatened that mark but as yet has not exceeded
233-3. The hefty junior is rated third on the coast and fifth nation
ally in his event.
Phil White, who has been a pleasant surprise for Jordan this year
blossoming out as a sophomore to break the school pole vault record
with a 14-4lt mark, will have a severe test in store for him. He faces
the finest three-man team in the country in San Jose State’s Dick
Kemmill, Dick Gear, and Jeff Chase. Kimmell who rates as the
favorite, cleared 15-1% just last weekend.
Some Promising Freshmen
A NUMBER of promising freshmen were also deemed worthy to
compete in the Invitational by the selection board. Bill Pratt re
ceived bids in two events, the SBO and mile where he holds the Stan
ford frosh records. Pratt will pass tip the mile to concentrate on the
shorter distance. He will not be thrown into the same heat with
Klier, Cunliffe, Siebert & Co. but will be joined by varsity star Rich
Parker in a more bearable field. Pratt cracked Klier’s old frosh mark
with a 1.53 against the San Jose State freshman earlier this year.
The mile should pose an interesting duel between two outstanding
freshman stars, Ben Tucker of the Spartans anti Robin Ruble of
Stanford. Recognized as the two best in the high school ranks last
year, they met twice, each winning one of the encounters. Tucker
prevailed earlier this year when the two power-packed freshman
teams vied, and Ruble has been anxiously awaiting the chance to
even (he score again. Both yearlings will have to contend with Fred
Abbingtion, the SCYV star.
RICH CHESEREK is the only Stanford entrant who will double,
going in the 220 and 440. Cheserek tied the standing frosh record
this year at 21.6 and has been a consistent winner in the 440 for the
undefeated squad. In the 220 he may be a little over his head with
such names as Doug Johnson, SJS; Willie White, formerly of Cali
fornia; Don Ramos, SJS; and Keith Thomassen, SCYV lined up
against him. In the 440 he’ll face Thomassen. whose 46.1 is the fastest
time this year, and such established stars as Ramos and Jack Yer
man, an ex-Trojan now competing for SCYV.
Steve Arch in the Shot
In the shot freshman star Steve Arch will match heaves with the
Stanford record holder Jerry Winters who was out to 59-11 last year.
He will wear SCYV colors Saturday. These two will got plenty of
competition from Sylvester and Dave Maggard, the California cham
pion.
YEARLING Steve Cortright will meet with another ex-Stanford
great Chuck Cobb in the high hurdles. Cobb was captain of the 1958
team and broke the school mark then with a 13.9 performance. That
record still stands. Cortright. is perhaps the greatest threat to Cobb’s
niche in the record book, having turned a 14.7 this year and showing
steady improvement.
All -.things considered the Invitational will bo one of the true
classics of the '6l track season, rivaling the Coliseum Relays whose
place it lakes on the Stanford schedule. And what better tribute to
a team than strong recognition in these circles.

The Dull Black and White
The dull black and white of such things as seasonal records and
statistics often hide the true worth of a team, or at least under
estimate it, as is the case with Stanford’s varsity track squad this
year. The Indians have won only three dual meets this season while
losing nine, but these numbers don’t indicate that the teams they've
met have been the finest in the nation. San Jose State, USC, UCLA.,
Oregon, and Oregon State will undoubtedly rate among the top at
the close of (he season when all the so-called experts make their
infallible Judgments.

A more accurate indication of the material on Coacli Payton
Jordan’s team perhaps lies in the fact that it attracted 14 bids from
the Northern California Invitational Track and Field Meet. This
classic, to be held at Freemont High School in Sunnyvale Saturday,
will draw the cream of Northern California track talent including
armed services and unattached amateurs in addition to the excep
tionally strong college field.

* PERHAPS the most interesting
race of the evening will be the 880
where Stanford’s Rich Klier will
run up against one of the fastest
fields put together this year. The
competition will come from an
other of Jordan’s proteges, Ernie
Cunliffe, who holds the Stanford
record with a 1:47.3. The former
Card daptain has been working
hard for the big spring meets and
should be close to top form. Last
weekend he turned a 4:02.5 mile
in the West Coast Relays, which
was good enough for second.
Also in the field will be an old
Stanford nerrtesis Jerry Siebert

member of the 1900 Olympic team,
as was Cunliffe, and has a 1:46.9

prevailed earlier this year when the two power-packed freshman
teams vied, and Ruble has been anxiously awaiting the chance to
even (he score again. Both yearlings will have to contend with Fred
Abbingtion, the SCYV star.
RICH CHESEREK is the only Stanford entrant who will double,
going in the 220 and 440. Cheserek tied the standing frosh record
this year at 21.6 and has been a consistent winner in the 440 for the
undefeated squad. In the 220 he may be a little over his head with
such names as Doug Johnson, SJS; Willie White, formerly of Cali
fornia; Don Ramos, SJS; and Keith Thomassen, SCYV lined up

time this year, and such established stars as Ramos and Jack Yer

Steve Arch in the Shot
In the shot freshman star Steve Arch will match heaves with the
Stanford record holder Jerry Winters who was out to 59-11 last year.
He will wear SCYV colors Saturday. These two will got plenty of
competition from Sylvester and Dave Maggard, the California cham
pion.
YEARLING Steve Cortright will meet with another ex-Stanford
great Chuck Cobb in the high hurdles. Cobb was captain of the 1958
team and broke the school mark then with a 13.9 performance. That
record still stands. Cortright. is perhaps the greatest threat to Cobb’s
niche in the record book, having turned a 14.7 this year and showing
steady improvement.
All -.things considered the Invitational will bo one of the true
classics of the '6l track season, rivaling the Coliseum Relays whose
place it lakes on the Stanford schedule. And what better tribute to
a team than strong recognition in these circles.

The Dull Black and White
The dull black and white of such things as seasonal records and
statistics often hide the true worth of a team, or at least under
estimate it, as is the case with Stanford’s varsity track squad this
year. The Indians have won only three dual meets this season while
losing nine, but these numbers don’t indicate that the teams they've
met have been the finest in the nation. San Jose State, USC, UCLA.,
Oregon, and Oregon State will undoubtedly rate among the top at
the close of (he season when all the so-called experts make their
infallible Judgments.

A more accurate indication of the material on Coacli Payton
Jordan’s team perhaps lies in the fact that it attracted 14 bids from
the Northern California Invitational Track and Field Meet. This
classic, to be held at Freemont High School in Sunnyvale Saturday,
will draw the cream of Northern California track talent including
armed services and unattached amateurs in addition to the excep
tionally strong college field.

* PERHAPS the most interesting
race of the evening will be the 880
where Stanford’s Rich Klier will
run up against one of the fastest
fields put together this year. The
competition will come from an
other of Jordan’s proteges, Ernie
Cunliffe, who holds the Stanford
record with a 1:47.3. The former
Card daptain has been working
hard for the big spring meets and
should be close to top form. Last
weekend he turned a 4:02.5 mile
in the West Coast Relays, which
was good enough for second.
Also in the field will be an old
Stanford nerrtesis Jerry Siebert
who competed for Cal in his un
dergraduate days. Siebert was a
member of the 1900 Olympic team,
as was Cunliffe, and has a 1:46.9
clocking to his credit.
To round out the field Santa
Clara Youth Village will enter

Jim Beatty, the American mile record holder and Larry Means, who
had the best time in the nation last year representing the Air Force.
THE DISCI'S field shapes up to be the finest assembled this year
with five men having gone over 170 feet. Dave Weill, who broke
the Stanford record as a sophomore this year with a heave of 175
feet, will be joined by teammate Don Bell in their quest against the
nation’s finest. Opposing them will be Dan Studney of San Jose
State, and Jay Sylvester and Jack Egan of Santa Clara Youth Village
all members of the magic 170-foot club.
Art Batchelder, a consistent winner all year for the Indians, will
run up against the stiffest competition he’s faced this year when he
encounters a brilliant field headed by former Card great Leo Long.
Long still holds the Stanford record which he set in 1954 at 235-9%.
Batchelder has threatened that mark but as yet has not exceeded
233-3. The hefty junior is rated third on the coast and fifth nation
ally in his event.
Phil White, who has been a pleasant surprise for Jordan this year
blossoming out as a sophomore to break the school pole vault record
with a 14-4lt mark, will have a severe test in store for him. He faces
the finest three-man team in the country in San Jose State’s Dick
Kemmill, Dick Gear, and Jeff Chase. Kimmell who rates as the
favorite, cleared 15-1% just last weekend.
Some Promising Freshmen
A NUMBER of promising freshmen were also deemed worthy to
compete in the Invitational by the selection board. Bill Pratt re
ceived bids in two events, the SBO and mile where he holds the Stan
ford frosh records. Pratt will pass tip the mile to concentrate on the
shorter distance. He will not be thrown into the same heat with
Klier, Cunliffe, Siebert & Co. but will be joined by varsity star Rich
Parker in a more bearable field. Pratt cracked Klier’s old frosh mark
with a 1.53 against the San Jose State freshman earlier this year.
The mile should pose an interesting duel between two outstanding
freshman stars, Ben Tucker of the Spartans anti Robin Ruble of
Stanford. Recognized as the two best in the high school ranks last
year, they met twice, each winning one of the encounters. Tucker
