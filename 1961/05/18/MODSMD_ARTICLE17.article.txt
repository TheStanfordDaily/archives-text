# Card Crews Seek Revenge In Seattle
## 
### 
Stanford’s varsity and JV crews,
beaten only by Washington and
Cal thus far in the season, got a
chance to avenge those defeats
this weekend as they meet the
Huskies and the Bears in the fifth
annual Western Splints at Seattle
Saturday.

FOR THE Cards (he Sprints of
fer not only an opportunity to

score an upset win over their Big
Five foes, but may well determine
whether or not the locals enter
the Intercollegiate Rowing Asso
ciation championships to be held
on Lake Onondaga in Syracuse,
June 17. Crew members will vote
on entering the IRA nationals
only after competing in Seattle.
Rapidly gaining prestige, (he
Western Sprints are now consid
ered the most important rowing

event on the West Coast and they
rival the well-established Eastern
Sprints on the national level.
This will be the first time that
the 2000 meter race has been held
in Seattle and the field will be one
of the largest in the history of
the event with USC, Oregon State,
UCLA, Long Beach State and
British Columbia entered in addi
tion to Stanford, Cal and Wash
ington.

THE CALIFORNIA Golden
Bears will be favored on the basis
of their decisive victory over Stan
ford on the Oakland Estuary two
weeks ago and their win over the
Huskies at Seattle last weekend.
Earlier in the season the In
dians showed winning form, beat
ing Oregon State, UCLA and USC
before losing to the two AAWU
powerhouses. In between the two
losses the Redskins added three
more wins, beating Long Beach
State and then drubbing SC and
the Bruins in Los Angeles to win
the Harbach Cup regatta for the
sixth straight time.
Stanford’s second boat has a
three win and two loss record for
the season; the JV’s beat UCLA
twice, USC once and lost to Cal
and UW.
THE VARSITY will be stroked
by captain Jon Loreen. with Jeff
Keller, Ed Ferry, John Ferguson,
Dick Lyon. Dennis Keith, Pete
Whelan and Will McCall manning
the other seven oars. Phil Weaver
