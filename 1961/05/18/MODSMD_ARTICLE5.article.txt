# KOREA REVOLT
## Halt Tried By Seeking US Troops 
### PHIL NEWSOM UPI Foreign News Analyst 
Editor’s note; The following dis
patch tells for the first time of
Ihe behind-the-scenes maneuver
ing which accompanied this
week’s overthrow of I lie Korean
government, including United
States rejection of a dramatic last
minute plea that U.S. troops inter
vene.

The last official leader of the
South Korean Army revolt tried
at the last moment to stop it by
asking for U.S. troop intervention.
The man who made the plea
was Lt. Gen. Chang Do Yung, Ko
rean army chief of staff, and
chairman of the military revolu
tionary committee which toppled
Premier John M. Chang from
power.
Gen. Carter B. Magruder, head
of U.S. and United Nations forces
in Korea turned him down.
Sources say Chang is a figure
head and that intricate behind
the-scenes political negotiations
which have followed the coup
show that the revolutionary com
mittee may have had less strength
than first appeared.
The real driving force behind
the revolt was not General Chang
as announced but Maj. Gen. Pak
Chong-Hui, deputy commanding
general of the Korean second
army and now vice chairman of
the military junta.
It was Pak who gave the signal
for the assault. Chang almost in
stantly made his plea to General
Magruder.
Magruder refused so quickly he
could not have stopped to consult
Washington. Presumably, he
acted under standing orders for
such a situation.
Only some 4,000 troops out of a
total army of more than 500,000
took part.
The rebel camp is known to
have planned its mows deliber
ately to coax U.S. support. Rebel
decrees stressed anti-communism
and pro-Americanism.
In the negotiations now going
on. several groups which could
make trouble have not yet come
forward. One group is the stu
dents. who a year ago toppled
President Syngman Rhee. An
other is the local Communists.
The North Koreans also have so
far stayed in the background.

than first appeared.
The real driving force behind
the revolt was not General Chang
as announced but Maj. Gen. Pak
Chong-Hui, deputy commanding
general of the Korean second
army and now vice chairman of
the military junta.
It was Pak who gave the signal
for the assault. Chang almost in
stantly made his plea to General
Magruder.
Magruder refused so quickly he
could not have stopped to consult
Washington. Presumably, he
acted under standing orders for
such a situation.
Only some 4,000 troops out of a
total army of more than 500,000
took part.
The rebel camp is known to
have planned its mows deliber
ately to coax U.S. support. Rebel
decrees stressed anti-communism
and pro-Americanism.
In the negotiations now going
on. several groups which could
make trouble have not yet come
forward. One group is the stu
dents. who a year ago toppled
President Syngman Rhee. An
other is the local Communists.
The North Koreans also have so
far stayed in the background.
