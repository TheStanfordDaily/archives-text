## 
### 
LOS ANGELES ( UPD The
University of Southern California
announced yesterday it had re
ceived more than eight million in
cash and pledges toward financ
ing a master plan for vast expan
sion of the university.

Dr. Norman Topping, USC pres
ident, said the entire plan would
cost about $3O million within the
next four years. He said the plan

has been in preparation for two
and one-half years.
STANFORD’S Vice - Provost
Robert Wert, commenting on the
plan, said, “It is clear that USC is
the major private institution of
the southern portion of the state
and serves the major population
area of the state. This area should
have a strong, well-financed pri
vate university. California’s
strength in higher education de
pends on a blend between private
and public education, so that the
university wishes USC every pos
sible success in achieving finan
cial success.’’

Topping called the master plan
the university’s “new era for en
terprise and excellence in educa
tion.”

THE master plan calls for a
fifty per cent increase in faculty,
endowment of profesional chairs
in specialized fields, higher fac
ulty salaries, increased emphasis
on graduate study, increased en
rollment of full-time students and
moie housing.

“We are confident that Los An
geles, the southland, the state and
nation, which USC has served so
well since its founding 81 years
ago will support us even more
faithfully in the years ahead to
improve private, independent
higher education in the Pacific
Southwest,” Topping said.
