# UNIVERSITY OF THE SEVEN SEAS'
## Ocean-Going College Campus Set 
### 
WHITTIER, Calif. (UPD A new twist is about to be added lo
the field of education. It’s an ocean-going college campus.
Nobody knows just who came up with the idea of a floating
campus, but it appealed lo a group of California educators and busi
nessmen who formed a non-profit corporation as the backbone for
the University of the Seven Seas.
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES of the university includes the presi
dent of a pipe and supply company, a speech and drama professor
from Whittier College, an assistant professor of education at Cali
fornia Western University, a lumber company president, a retired
U.S. Navy rear admiral, a U.S. Agriculture Department entomologist,
an associate professor of history at California Western University, a
former school superintendent, and a former college president.
Within a day or two after the announcement of establishment of
the university, applications from prospective students began to
flow in.
Dr. E. Ray Nichols Jr., vice president of the board of trustees,
presently chairman of the Department of Speech and Drama at
Whittier College, said from 25 to 50 applications were being received
every day.
ACCORDING to Nichols, the university seeks to provide the most
favorable means for (he study of man, his resources, his environment
and his outreach. He said the university fell the mobile classroom is
the way to best provide that environment, and added. “Instead of
bringing (lie world piecemeal into the laboratory, we'll take the stu
dent into the world laboratory.”

By September 1962 the university plans to launch its first float
ing campus with 525 students and from 35 to 40 of the finest faculty
members available, Nichols said.
Arrangements have already been made to turn the SS Jerusalem
into the university's first mobile campus. A full-time class schedule
will be maintained at sea, and while the ship is in port, field trips,
seminars at local universities and other appropriate activities will be
■emphasized.
Dr. Nichols said the university is designed for upper division
college students and for those already holding degrees from accredited
colleges and universities.
“We’ll offer advanced courses for credit in the liberal arts which
pertain most directly to the concept of international relations,” he
said.
STUDENTS WILL be enrolled in schools of creative arts, human
resources, management of human affairs and physical resources,
with classes ranging from music and art to nutrition and climatology.
Operation costs of the university will be mot by tuition, but private
gifts will assisl in providing scholarships, development and endow
ment. Dr. Nichols estimated that tuition for one semester on the
ocean-going campus will range from $2,500 to $3,500, depending on
accommodations.
In a manner of speaking, the roaming college campus will com
pete with many of its land-based counterparts, it'll bo fully air con
ditioned, have a large swimming pool, and broad areas for sports,
sun bathing, dining and dancing.
