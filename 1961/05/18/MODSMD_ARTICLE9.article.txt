# Work Starts On Clusters; Project To Relieve Jobless
## Four Houses To Occupy Cluster Within One Year 
### GREGG HOPKINS 
Construction of the first fraternity cluster is underway between
Mayfield Avenue and The Knoll. Four of Stanford's 24 fraternities
are expected to take occupancy in about a year.
The Daily learned last night that construction was begun at least
three weeks before originally scheduled at the request of the federal
government, which is helping to finance the clusters. The purpose
in the schedule speedup was to translate government loan funds into

jobs for the Santa Clara County!
area.

This program, a part of Presi
dent Kennedy’s recession fighting
measures, is the first work relief
in this area.
TDK CLUSTER project, being
built for the University by the
Utah Construction Company at a
cost of $1,281,700. will be occupied
by Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Theta
Delta Chi.
Plans for the group of build
ings were dVawn by San Fran
cisco architect John Carl Warn
ecke and Associates, and consist
of a complex of four resident
type buildings for the fraternities
and a home to bo occupied by a
senior faculty member’s family.
Each fraternity house will con
tain its own kitchen, contrary to
original plans formulated in 1957
for the cluster projects. Paul
Lindfors, Theta Dell representa
tive to the IFC committee which
planned the development in con
junction with the University De
velopment Office and the archi
tect, told the Daily last night that
the fraternities, in their effort to
include in the new buildings de
sireable features of present fra
ternities, requested that small
kitchenettes be made part of the
plans so that houses could pre
pare snacks and food for social
functions independent of the cen
tral kitchens.
AS PLANNING progressed, the
kitchenettes became larger, Lind
fors said, until finally they were
designed for preparation of break
fast and lunch for the individual
fraternities, leaving only dinner
for central kitchen preparation.
When the bids were returned,
according to Lindfors, costs were
above the University’s proposal.
As a construction economy meas
ure, and because of difficulties
arising from transporting food in
heated carts to the four fraterni
ties, the individual kitchens were
enlarged to handle all cooking
and the central kitchen was
dropped.
ACCORDING TO the Warnecke
firm's plans, the cluster buildings
are to use materials blending
with nearby faculty residences.
They will have two-man study
bedroom suites, individual house
libraries and study rooms.

In regard to his house’s feeling
on the completed plan, Lindfors
said the Theta Delts were “pretty
well pleased.” Their fear was that
the project would be "just an
other long-passageway Wilb u r
Hall,” but the architect had done
his best in conformation with Uni
versity desires to give the build
ings individuality.

The two-man suites, arranged
generally together in a wing, con
form to the trend in modern resi
dential construction, said Lind
fors, to isolate sleeping areas of
living quarters from activity
areas.

FUNDS FOR the construction
of the clusters come from com
bined sources: gifts from the
alumni of each fraterity, other
gifts and a loan from the Federal
Housing and Home Finance
Agency.

Set to go in the second frater
nity group, to be located near the
first are Kappa Alpha, Zeta Psi,
Alpha Delta Phi and Alpha Kappa
Lambda. Plans for this second
group are about six months be
hind the fii’st, sources said.
The first cluster was once set
to begin last September, so is
beginning construction eight
months late. Delay in financing
was part of the holdup. The origi
nal occupancy goal-date, for a
start last fall, was the fall of 1961.
Using the same time schedule, the
first cluster should be ready for
occupancy in the spring of 1962.

IFC President Swede Pierson turns first carload of earth on
newly begun fraternity cluster.
Construction of the first fraternity cluster is underway between
Mayfield Avenue and The Knoll. Four of Stanford's 24 fraternities
are expected to take occupancy in about a year.
The Daily learned last night that construction was begun at least
three weeks before originally scheduled at the request of the federal
government, which is helping to finance the clusters. The purpose
in the schedule speedup was to translate government loan funds into

jobs for the Santa Clara County!
area.

This program, a part of Presi
dent Kennedy’s recession fighting
measures, is the first work relief
in this area.
TDK CLUSTER project, being
built for the University by the
Utah Construction Company at a
cost of $1,281,700. will be occupied
by Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Theta
Delta Chi.
Plans for the group of build
ings were dVawn by San Fran
cisco architect John Carl Warn
ecke and Associates, and consist
of a complex of four resident
type buildings for the fraternities
and a home to bo occupied by a
senior faculty member’s family.
Each fraternity house will con
tain its own kitchen, contrary to
original plans formulated in 1957
for the cluster projects. Paul
Lindfors, Theta Dell representa
tive to the IFC committee which
planned the development in con
junction with the University De
velopment Office and the archi
tect, told the Daily last night that
the fraternities, in their effort to
include in the new buildings de
sireable features of present fra
ternities, requested that small
kitchenettes be made part of the
plans so that houses could pre
pare snacks and food for social
functions independent of the cen
tral kitchens.
AS PLANNING progressed, the
kitchenettes became larger, Lind
fors said, until finally they were
designed for preparation of break
fast and lunch for the individual
fraternities, leaving only dinner
for central kitchen preparation.
When the bids were returned,
according to Lindfors, costs were
above the University’s proposal.
As a construction economy meas
ure, and because of difficulties
arising from transporting food in
heated carts to the four fraterni
ties, the individual kitchens were
enlarged to handle all cooking
and the central kitchen was
dropped.
ACCORDING TO the Warnecke
firm's plans, the cluster buildings
are to use materials blending
with nearby faculty residences.
They will have two-man study
bedroom suites, individual house
libraries and study rooms.

In regard to his house’s feeling
on the completed plan, Lindfors
said the Theta Delts were “pretty
well pleased.” Their fear was that
the project would be "just an
other long-passageway Wilb u r
Hall,” but the architect had done
his best in conformation with Uni
versity desires to give the build
ings individuality.

The two-man suites, arranged
generally together in a wing, con
form to the trend in modern resi
dential construction, said Lind
fors, to isolate sleeping areas of
living quarters from activity
areas.

FUNDS FOR the construction
of the clusters come from com
bined sources: gifts from the
alumni of each fraterity, other
gifts and a loan from the Federal
Housing and Home Finance
Agency.

Set to go in the second frater
nity group, to be located near the
first are Kappa Alpha, Zeta Psi,
Alpha Delta Phi and Alpha Kappa
Lambda. Plans for this second
group are about six months be
hind the fii’st, sources said.
The first cluster was once set
to begin last September, so is
beginning construction eight
months late. Delay in financing
was part of the holdup. The origi
nal occupancy goal-date, for a
start last fall, was the fall of 1961.
Using the same time schedule, the
first cluster should be ready for
occupancy in the spring of 1962.
