place you love especially well in springtime...perhaps a place of hill
side and valley like this. You’ll think of this place when you try a Salem
cigarette, so soft, so gentle, so refreshing is its smoke. Special High
Porosity paper “air-softens” every puff. Fine tobaccos add their own
richness to Salem’s taste, too. Smoke refreshed... smoke Salem!
• menthol fresh
• rich tobacco taste
• modem filter, too
