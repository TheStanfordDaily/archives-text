Maybe you’re a fellow with more or less normal driving habits who’s looking
for a change of pace. Or maybe you’re a red-hot sports car buff. Either way,
you’ll find the fastest relief for that tantalizing itch in your driving foot at your
Chevrolet dealer’s One-Stop Shopping Center. He’s got cars that run the sport
ing gamut like no others—nimble Corvair Monzas (2- or 4-door), charged-up
Impala Super Sports (in five different body styles) and the kingpin of produc
tion sports cars, the Corvette. You can take your choice without
chasing all over town. They’re all stablemates under the same roof!
