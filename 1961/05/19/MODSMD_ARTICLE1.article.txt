# GENERAL STUDIES PROGRAM QUESTIONNAIRES
## Seniors Asked To Evaluate Their Education 
### KEEM STASSEN 
“What has been your goal in securing a
college education?” “Would you send a son
or a daughter to Stanford?” “Why did you
choose your major?”
THKSK ARE some of the more than 20(1
questions which 300 seniors are answering
this week. The Committee on General Stu
dies has sent each of them an 11-page ques
tionnaire in an attempt to evaluate their edu
cation.

“This is your opportunity to make a per
sonal contribution to improvement of under
graduate education at Stanford,” Dr. Robert
Walker, chairman of the Committee on Gen
eral Studies, wrote to the seniors.

"We want to keep the general studies pro
gram itr continual review,” Philip Rhinelan
der, Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, told the Daily yesterday.

Rhinelander, who is a member of the Com
mittee on General Studies, explained “This is
part of a concerted effort to do a little sys
tematic stock-taking.”

The seniors will answer questions about
all phases of their education. They have been
asked to evaluate each of the general studies
courses, the quality of the professors in each
department of the University, and the senior
colloquia.
THERE ARE ALSO questions about ex
tracurricular activities, the intellectual at
mosphere of University residences, the rela
tion between work spent and grade received
in various courses, lab assistants, faculty as
sociates, and general studies requirements.
Some of the questions indicate that the
committee is considering changes which
would affect the organization of the Univer
sity.

ONE OF these questions is “Should Stan
ford change to the semester system?” An
other' is "Should each student write a thesis
for graduation?” Still another is “Would you
approve of some system of comprehensive
examinations for graduation?”

“I can guarantee that the questionnaire
will be considered very carefully,” Professor
William Bark of the history department said.

Bark, who is also a member of the Com
mittee on General Studies, explained that the
general studies program has been in effect
for five years. It is time to do some evaluat
ting,” he said, “I hope we don't do anything
rash.

THE SENIORS who rec'eived the question
naires are supposed to bo a “representative
sampling” of the senior class. Their answers
to the questions will bo compared with those
of the class of ’55, who filled out a similar

questionnaire. That questionnaire led to the
present geenral studies program.
When asked if the general studies require

ments will be changed in the
near future, Dean Rhinelan
der- replied “It is impossible
to tell. We will be guided by
the results of the question
naire.”
“WE FEEL that student
opinion, systematically ta- ;
ken and honestly given, is a j
very important source of in
formation,” Rhinelander ex
plained.

Professor Bark was asked

if the questionnaire was a routine evaluation,
oi' if it was a result of specific complaints.
“It is connected with our re-evaluation of
the general studies program as well as our

concern over instruction in the freshman
year,” he replied.
Los Roos, chairman of the student-faculty
commission, said “We are especially inter
ested to see if our analysis of the faculty
associate program and of general studies ad
visers is accurate.”

SOME of the questions are rather personal
For example, the seniors are asked, “If you
had to do it all over again, would you major
in the same department?” Another question
asked was “How much time per week have
you spent in preparing for all courses?”

Other of the questions are amusing. One
of these is, “During which year at Stanford
did you develop least?” The seniors also
asked to rate courses and friends.
All questionnaires should bo turned in to
the general studies office today. They need
not be signed.

“I can guarantee that the questionnaire
will be considered very carefully,” Professor
William Bark of the history department said.

Bark, who is also a member of the Com
mittee on General Studies, explained that the
general studies program has been in effect
for five years. It is time to do some evaluat
ting,” he said, “I hope we don't do anything
rash.

THE SENIORS who rec'eived the question
naires are supposed to bo a “representative
sampling” of the senior class. Their answers
to the questions will bo compared with those
of the class of ’55, who filled out a similar

questionnaire. That questionnaire led to the
present geenral studies program.
When asked if the general studies require

ments will be changed in the
near future, Dean Rhinelan
der- replied “It is impossible
to tell. We will be guided by
the results of the question
naire.”
“WE FEEL that student
opinion, systematically ta- ;
ken and honestly given, is a j
very important source of in
formation,” Rhinelander ex
plained.

Professor Bark was asked

if the questionnaire was a routine evaluation,
oi' if it was a result of specific complaints.
“It is connected with our re-evaluation of
the general studies program as well as our

concern over instruction in the freshman
year,” he replied.
Los Roos, chairman of the student-faculty
commission, said “We are especially inter
ested to see if our analysis of the faculty
associate program and of general studies ad
visers is accurate.”

SOME of the questions are rather personal
For example, the seniors are asked, “If you
had to do it all over again, would you major
in the same department?” Another question
asked was “How much time per week have
you spent in preparing for all courses?”

Other of the questions are amusing. One
of these is, “During which year at Stanford
did you develop least?” The seniors also
asked to rate courses and friends.
All questionnaires should bo turned in to
the general studies office today. They need
not be signed.

“What has been your goal in securing a
college education?” “Would you send a son
or a daughter to Stanford?” “Why did you
choose your major?”
THKSK ARE some of the more than 20(1
questions which 300 seniors are answering
this week. The Committee on General Stu
dies has sent each of them an 11-page ques
tionnaire in an attempt to evaluate their edu
cation.

“This is your opportunity to make a per
sonal contribution to improvement of under
graduate education at Stanford,” Dr. Robert
Walker, chairman of the Committee on Gen
eral Studies, wrote to the seniors.

"We want to keep the general studies pro
gram itr continual review,” Philip Rhinelan
der, Dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences, told the Daily yesterday.

Rhinelander, who is a member of the Com
mittee on General Studies, explained “This is
part of a concerted effort to do a little sys
tematic stock-taking.”

The seniors will answer questions about
all phases of their education. They have been
asked to evaluate each of the general studies
courses, the quality of the professors in each
department of the University, and the senior
colloquia.
THERE ARE ALSO questions about ex
tracurricular activities, the intellectual at
mosphere of University residences, the rela
tion between work spent and grade received
in various courses, lab assistants, faculty as
sociates, and general studies requirements.
Some of the questions indicate that the
committee is considering changes which
would affect the organization of the Univer
sity.

ONE OF these questions is “Should Stan
ford change to the semester system?” An
other' is "Should each student write a thesis
for graduation?” Still another is “Would you
approve of some system of comprehensive
examinations for graduation?”
