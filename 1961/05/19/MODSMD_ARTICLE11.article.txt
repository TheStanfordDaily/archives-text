WASHINGTON UPI Chester i
Bowles, acting secretary of state,
said yesterday he assumes the
United States will recognize the
new' military degime in Korea,
although a decision now would
be premature.
Bowles said after a three-hour
closed session with the House for
eign affairs committee that the
Korean picture is “crystalizing.”
“It should he generally under
stood.” lie said, "that tills change
of government in Korea no mat
ter how unconstitutional it is—
does not mean a change to a gov
ernment antagonistic to the Unit
ed Stales.

‘‘The mili t a r y leaders are
strongly anti-communist and pro-
American. Ol course, when you
upset constitutional governments
any time and anywhere, there is
hound to be concern about it.”
Bowles said the United States
should face up to the fact that
“we can’t run the world.” He said
it should concentrate on helping
societies “which offer a maxi
mum freedom of choice to their
people.”
In Seoul revolutionary leaders
consolidated their power by ex
panding the military command
from five to 32 members, includ
ing top officers of the armed
services.
