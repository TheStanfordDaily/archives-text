# Kennedy Changes Press Relations
## 
### 
President Kennedy, a onetime newspaperman himself, has pro
duced more changes in relations with the press, radio and television
than did any of his three predecessors. While Messrs. Truman and
Roosevelt always regarded their relations with the press as a battle
of wits and Mr. Eisenhower attemped to make the press conference
a useful information device, none have made the adroit use of the
media, while at the same time questioning its judgment as Mr.
Kennedy,

The President's office has been thrown open to photographers
and television crews alike. Two wire service reporters, as did sev
eral magazine men, spent an entire working day with the president,
reporting what occurred with full pictures and stories. Both the Na
tional Broadcasting System and the Columbia Broadcasting System
have been allowed to show live shots of the President and his
assistants as they transact the nation's business. While Press Secre
tary Pierre Salinger has said, "I don't really believe that you can
'overexpose' the President of the United States. I think when people
talk about 'overexposure' they are if Iking about show business—
about jugglers and comics getting tc much TV time." However,
too much exposure, especially in reference to television, does re
sult in the nation's business being play-acted for the public, with
the Administration playing the actors and sometimes the comics.
One wonders, too, whether President Eisenhower could have
employed the same techniques without the cry that Madison Ave
nue had moved into the White House. Apparently, Madison Ave
nue techniques are allowable, if employed by Mr. Kennedy.
At the same time the President has been making such wide use
of the communications media, he has fed it false information and
told it to impose self-censorship. Speaking in the wake of the Cuban
fiasco with disclosures in major newspapers that the Central Intelli
gence Agency planned, trained, and executed the ill-fated landings,
the President has asked every newspaper to ask itself "with respect
to every story: 'ls it news?' All I suggest is that you add the ques
tion: 'ls it in the national interest?' " While this can certainly be
asked, we suggest that if the press had told more, not less of the
facts on the Cuban build-up, perhaps informed public opinion would
have convinced the White House to cancel its plans of folly.
Yet if the press should show more responsibility, as Mr. Ken
nedy seems to think, so should the Administration. Throughout the
Cuban affair it repeatedly lied, even though the facts were well
known and widely-dispersed. At first news of the landing the Ad
ministration fed the press a story that 5,000 rebels had landed, in
the hopes of producing a revolution within the island. As the land
ing was crushed the Administration changed its story to 400 men
supplying guerrilla forces. In neither case was the true story pre
sented. Only after the reporters in Florida dug out the true story
did the Administration admit the part it played in the landings.
We do not believe the President should deliberately misinform
the public. As the New York Times has editorially said, "The basic
principle involved is that of confidence. A dictatorship can get
along without an informed public opinion. A democracy cannot.
Not only is it unethical to deceive one's own public as part of a
system of deceiving an adversary government; it is also foolish.
Our executive officers and our national legislators are elected on
stated days, but actually they must be re-elected day by day by
understanding and support."
In the long run national security in the cold war can be under
mined far more easily from the suppression of news than from an
overabundance of information.

gence Agency planned, trained, and executed the ill-fated landings,
the President has asked every newspaper to ask itself "with respect
to every story: 'ls it news?' All I suggest is that you add the ques
tion: 'ls it in the national interest?' " While this can certainly be
asked, we suggest that if the press had told more, not less of the
facts on the Cuban build-up, perhaps informed public opinion would
have convinced the White House to cancel its plans of folly.
Yet if the press should show more responsibility, as Mr. Ken
nedy seems to think, so should the Administration. Throughout the
Cuban affair it repeatedly lied, even though the facts were well
known and widely-dispersed. At first news of the landing the Ad
ministration fed the press a story that 5,000 rebels had landed, in
the hopes of producing a revolution within the island. As the land
ing was crushed the Administration changed its story to 400 men
supplying guerrilla forces. In neither case was the true story pre
sented. Only after the reporters in Florida dug out the true story
did the Administration admit the part it played in the landings.
We do not believe the President should deliberately misinform
the public. As the New York Times has editorially said, "The basic
principle involved is that of confidence. A dictatorship can get
along without an informed public opinion. A democracy cannot.
Not only is it unethical to deceive one's own public as part of a
system of deceiving an adversary government; it is also foolish.
Our executive officers and our national legislators are elected on
stated days, but actually they must be re-elected day by day by
understanding and support."
In the long run national security in the cold war can be under
mined far more easily from the suppression of news than from an
overabundance of information.
President Kennedy, a onetime newspaperman himself, has pro
duced more changes in relations with the press, radio and television
than did any of his three predecessors. While Messrs. Truman and
Roosevelt always regarded their relations with the press as a battle
of wits and Mr. Eisenhower attemped to make the press conference
a useful information device, none have made the adroit use of the
media, while at the same time questioning its judgment as Mr.
Kennedy,

The President's office has been thrown open to photographers
and television crews alike. Two wire service reporters, as did sev
eral magazine men, spent an entire working day with the president,
reporting what occurred with full pictures and stories. Both the Na
tional Broadcasting System and the Columbia Broadcasting System
have been allowed to show live shots of the President and his
assistants as they transact the nation's business. While Press Secre
tary Pierre Salinger has said, "I don't really believe that you can
'overexpose' the President of the United States. I think when people
talk about 'overexposure' they are if Iking about show business—
about jugglers and comics getting tc much TV time." However,
too much exposure, especially in reference to television, does re
sult in the nation's business being play-acted for the public, with
the Administration playing the actors and sometimes the comics.
One wonders, too, whether President Eisenhower could have
employed the same techniques without the cry that Madison Ave
nue had moved into the White House. Apparently, Madison Ave
nue techniques are allowable, if employed by Mr. Kennedy.
At the same time the President has been making such wide use
of the communications media, he has fed it false information and
told it to impose self-censorship. Speaking in the wake of the Cuban
fiasco with disclosures in major newspapers that the Central Intelli
gence Agency planned, trained, and executed the ill-fated landings,
