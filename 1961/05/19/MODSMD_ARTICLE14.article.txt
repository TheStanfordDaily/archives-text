It was a nice thought on President Kennedy's part to send a
message to the Americans for Democratic Action, describing liberals
as the "Minutemen" of this space age. We fancy that the A.D.A.
was beginning to think of itself as the Old Guard of Liberalism in
this country; mustached veterans of many a campaign, scarred and
frost-bitten from the long retreat from Washington that began in '52;
half-elated, half-scared by a narrow victory on the New Frontier;
bearing their worn Phi Beta Kappa keys with a tired pride and clutch
ing their portable typewriters with the defiance of the Last Square
at Waterloo.
Now the President has called them Minutemen—and suddenly
there is the picture of that young farmer at Lexington, dropping his
plough and seizing his musket, in the dawn of a new nation. One
can hear "a hurry of hoofs in a village street" as Arthur Schlesinger
rides again to spread the alarm: one can see the embattled history
professors rise from the little wars of academic footnotes and, ball
point pen in hand, form rough ranks on the green. Mr. Kennedy's
"good friend, Sam Beer," is there, bidding his men hold their fire,
while the disciplined tramp of the marching American Medical Asso
ciation and the National Association of Manufacturers is heard in
the distance. Then the challenges—and the sudden muffled roar of
oratory and the sibilant sound of press releases in flight show the
battle is joined.
Well, it was a charming idea of the President's (or could it have
been Dr. Schlesinger's?) and it casts an aura of romance over a
gathering that has become rather old hat with the passing years.
Besides, the Administration has been turning its attention of late to
the need for real guerrillas with real guns for a real, if —one hopes—
limited war. Perhaps Mr. Kennedy is trying to do a little recruiting
in the A.D.A. Anyone for Laos?
