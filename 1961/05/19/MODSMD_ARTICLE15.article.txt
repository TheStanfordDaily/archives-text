Debaters' Tricks
Prof. E. S. Shaw is to be con
gratulated for his excellent state
ment in The Stanford Daily of
May 8, replying to some of the
views recently expressed by Prof.
Paul A. Baran and Professor
Paul M. Sweezy. To my knowl
edge many members of the Stan
ford faculty warmly approve
Prof, Shaw’s stand and 1 have no
doubt that a great many others
would state the case even more
strongly than he did. Most of the
faculty would also agree with all
three economists in their desire
for wider participation in “open
and vigorous political discussion”
at Stanford. Democracies thrive
on free and open discussions, just
as dictatorships must prevent
them by force or run the risk of
withering away. Yet one may
wonder, in the light of Prof. Ba
ran’s and Prof. Swee/.y’s answer
in this Tuesday’s Daily, if any
real purpose is to be served by
discussing the Cuban issue with
those who “have never made any
secret” of their "desire to advance
and develop the ideas of Marxism
and socialism in this country and
elsewhere.”

Tho trouble is that such a dis
cussion is likely to be more “vig
orous” than “open” and if we may
judge by Tuesday’s letter, pre
senting the socialist “reply” to
Prof. Shaw’s arguments, it is cer
tain to be protean, if nothing else.
Let me illustrate briefly what I
mean. Prof. Shaw apparently be
lieves not only in open and vig
orous but also fair and thorough
discussion of controversial issues.
The other side apparently be
lieves in partial rather than com
plete presentation, in debaters’
tricks rather than careful and
complete examination of the evi
dence. It is hardly surprising if
Prof. Baran’s and Prof. Sweezy’s
“reply” bears some resemblance
to a juggling act.
Prof. Shaw, in his old-fashioned
way, believes in trying to lay bare
the whole truth, not just the part
of it favorable to his side in the
discussion. Consequently, he
makes a number of "concessions”
about past errors in American
policy in Cuba. Do his opponents
make any concessions of “wrong
turns” or tragic mistakes in pol
icy by socialist states, such as
the USSR, or indeed Castro’s
Cuba itself? By no means do they
do this; they are far too busy
seizing on Prof. Shaw’s “conces
sions” and attempting to turn
them against him. They appear
to believe further that the Mar
shall Plan was “a measure for
shoring up capitalist ruling
classes both here and abroad.”
The United States, they say, “un
der its present social structure, is
an imperialist country.” And the
naval base at Guantanamo Bay
is “a symbol of American imperi
alism in the Caribbean . . They
maintain also that “it is not true,
as Prof. Shaw asserts, that in our
last analysis, ‘the United States
can have no con’ect policy toward
Cuba.’ ”
Now, as A1 Smith, an American
even more old-fashioned than
Prof. Shaw, used to say, “Let’s
look at the record.” Prof. Baran
and Sweezy concede no socialist
mistakes but that does not mean
there were none. The United

States is accused of “shoring up
capitalist ruling clases” but noth
ing is admitted about socialist
efforts in behalf of socialist mili
tary coups- in Korea, in Vietnam,
in Laos, and, of all places, in
Cuba, where a good deal of loud
socialist sabre rattling has been
done in the last year. Though the
United States is called “an impe
rialist country,’’ nothing seems to
be said about Red Chinese ven
tures in Tibet and India, in addi
tion to places already named. Nor
have we forgotten those self-sac
rificing Chinese "volunteers” in
the Korean War, which was a
socialistic war of imperialist ag
gression. There is an old Anglo-
Saxon (this is a cuss word in
Russian) legal principle to the
effect that a plaintiff must come
into court with clean hands. For
anyone working to “advance and
develop the ideas of Marxism and
socialism in this country and
everywhere else” to talk about
American imperialism, without
offering a word of apology about
the bloody, imperialist conquest
of Hungary, and the repression
of the other imperialist holdings
of the leading socialist state is
an act of audacious but quite fa
miliar effrontery. It would be in
teresting to have Hungary ex
plained, from the socialist posi
tion, but it is not to be expected
that this will he done.
As for Prof. Baran and Swee
zy’s insistence that Prof. Shaw is
wrong and that the United States
could have a correct policy toward
Cuba, it is clear what this means.
All we have to do is agree with
them; so easily can a “correct
policy” be achieved.
Yet we should perhaps be pa
tient. The most strongly social
istic countries are those which
have most recently emerged from
despotism and which only the
other day began to shake off the
strangle-hold of poverty, ignor
ance. and superstition. Not one
of them, so far as I know, has
yet succeeded in establishing a
society in which, while the will

of the majority prevails, the
rights of the minority are pro
tected; in which, while the wel
fare of society as a whole is
steadily advanced, the freedom
and dignity of the individual are
maintained; and in which politi
cal discussions can be not only
open and vigorous but devoted
to the search for the whole truth.
Until socialism, in Cuba or else
where, achieves more freedom, I
shall not be much impressed by
one-sided and unsupported accu
sations of imperialism or even by
the most enthusiastic eulogies of
Fidel Castro as a new apostle of
the Rights of Man.

Not For Sex
Why must we be exposed to
the baseness of the Chaparral?
The stories from this trash book
were worse than many that ap
pear in “dime novels.” It is ap
parent that the Chaparral must
depend upon sex to bolster its
circulation. How did this last
issue avoid censorship? Such filth
must be stopped. I propose that
there be either stricter censorship
or the abolishment of the maga
zine entirely.
People will lose track of their
ideals if they let their sensual
desires overshadow their aca
demic endeavourings. The Stan
ford women were unfairly treat
ed, and I think the Chaparral
should make a public apology.
The girls are not all ravishing,
but they are generally good con
versationalists and companions
and are altogether quite suitable.
Let us cast aside these insults
to our school, and let us remem
ber that we are here not for sex,
but for intellectual pursuit.

socialist sabre rattling has been
done in the last year. Though the
United States is called “an impe
rialist country,’’ nothing seems to
be said about Red Chinese ven
tures in Tibet and India, in addi
tion to places already named. Nor
have we forgotten those self-sac
rificing Chinese "volunteers” in
the Korean War, which was a
socialistic war of imperialist ag
gression. There is an old Anglo-
Saxon (this is a cuss word in
Russian) legal principle to the
effect that a plaintiff must come
into court with clean hands. For
anyone working to “advance and
develop the ideas of Marxism and
socialism in this country and
everywhere else” to talk about
American imperialism, without
offering a word of apology about
the bloody, imperialist conquest
of Hungary, and the repression
of the other imperialist holdings
of the leading socialist state is
an act of audacious but quite fa
miliar effrontery. It would be in
teresting to have Hungary ex
plained, from the socialist posi
tion, but it is not to be expected
that this will he done.
As for Prof. Baran and Swee
zy’s insistence that Prof. Shaw is
wrong and that the United States
could have a correct policy toward
Cuba, it is clear what this means.
All we have to do is agree with
them; so easily can a “correct
policy” be achieved.
Yet we should perhaps be pa
tient. The most strongly social
istic countries are those which
have most recently emerged from
despotism and which only the
other day began to shake off the
strangle-hold of poverty, ignor
ance. and superstition. Not one
of them, so far as I know, has
yet succeeded in establishing a
society in which, while the will

of the majority prevails, the
rights of the minority are pro
tected; in which, while the wel
fare of society as a whole is
steadily advanced, the freedom
and dignity of the individual are
maintained; and in which politi
cal discussions can be not only
open and vigorous but devoted
to the search for the whole truth.
Until socialism, in Cuba or else
where, achieves more freedom, I
shall not be much impressed by
one-sided and unsupported accu
sations of imperialism or even by
the most enthusiastic eulogies of
Fidel Castro as a new apostle of
the Rights of Man.

Not For Sex
Why must we be exposed to
the baseness of the Chaparral?
The stories from this trash book
were worse than many that ap
pear in “dime novels.” It is ap
parent that the Chaparral must
depend upon sex to bolster its
circulation. How did this last
issue avoid censorship? Such filth
must be stopped. I propose that
there be either stricter censorship
or the abolishment of the maga
zine entirely.
People will lose track of their
ideals if they let their sensual
desires overshadow their aca
demic endeavourings. The Stan
ford women were unfairly treat
ed, and I think the Chaparral
should make a public apology.
The girls are not all ravishing,
but they are generally good con
versationalists and companions
and are altogether quite suitable.
Let us cast aside these insults
to our school, and let us remem
ber that we are here not for sex,
but for intellectual pursuit.

Debaters' Tricks
Prof. E. S. Shaw is to be con
gratulated for his excellent state
ment in The Stanford Daily of
May 8, replying to some of the
views recently expressed by Prof.
Paul A. Baran and Professor
Paul M. Sweezy. To my knowl
edge many members of the Stan
ford faculty warmly approve
Prof, Shaw’s stand and 1 have no
doubt that a great many others
would state the case even more
strongly than he did. Most of the
faculty would also agree with all
three economists in their desire
for wider participation in “open
and vigorous political discussion”
at Stanford. Democracies thrive
on free and open discussions, just
as dictatorships must prevent
them by force or run the risk of
withering away. Yet one may
wonder, in the light of Prof. Ba
ran’s and Prof. Swee/.y’s answer
in this Tuesday’s Daily, if any
real purpose is to be served by
discussing the Cuban issue with
those who “have never made any
secret” of their "desire to advance
and develop the ideas of Marxism
and socialism in this country and
elsewhere.”

Tho trouble is that such a dis
cussion is likely to be more “vig
orous” than “open” and if we may
judge by Tuesday’s letter, pre
senting the socialist “reply” to
Prof. Shaw’s arguments, it is cer
tain to be protean, if nothing else.
Let me illustrate briefly what I
mean. Prof. Shaw apparently be
lieves not only in open and vig
orous but also fair and thorough
discussion of controversial issues.
The other side apparently be
lieves in partial rather than com
plete presentation, in debaters’
tricks rather than careful and
complete examination of the evi
dence. It is hardly surprising if
Prof. Baran’s and Prof. Sweezy’s
“reply” bears some resemblance
to a juggling act.
Prof. Shaw, in his old-fashioned
way, believes in trying to lay bare
the whole truth, not just the part
of it favorable to his side in the
discussion. Consequently, he
makes a number of "concessions”
about past errors in American
policy in Cuba. Do his opponents
make any concessions of “wrong
turns” or tragic mistakes in pol
icy by socialist states, such as
the USSR, or indeed Castro’s
Cuba itself? By no means do they
do this; they are far too busy
seizing on Prof. Shaw’s “conces
sions” and attempting to turn
them against him. They appear
to believe further that the Mar
shall Plan was “a measure for
shoring up capitalist ruling
classes both here and abroad.”
The United States, they say, “un
der its present social structure, is
an imperialist country.” And the
naval base at Guantanamo Bay
is “a symbol of American imperi
alism in the Caribbean . . They
maintain also that “it is not true,
as Prof. Shaw asserts, that in our
last analysis, ‘the United States
can have no con’ect policy toward
Cuba.’ ”
Now, as A1 Smith, an American
even more old-fashioned than
Prof. Shaw, used to say, “Let’s
look at the record.” Prof. Baran
and Sweezy concede no socialist
mistakes but that does not mean
there were none. The United

States is accused of “shoring up
capitalist ruling clases” but noth
ing is admitted about socialist
efforts in behalf of socialist mili
tary coups- in Korea, in Vietnam,
in Laos, and, of all places, in
Cuba, where a good deal of loud
socialist sabre rattling has been
done in the last year. Though the
United States is called “an impe

gratulated for his excellent state
ment in The Stanford Daily of
May 8, replying to some of the
views recently expressed by Prof.
Paul A. Baran and Professor
Paul M. Sweezy. To my knowl
edge many members of the Stan
ford faculty warmly approve
Prof, Shaw’s stand and 1 have no
doubt that a great many others
would state the case even more
strongly than he did. Most of the
faculty would also agree with all
three economists in their desire
for wider participation in “open
and vigorous political discussion”
at Stanford. Democracies thrive
on free and open discussions, just
as dictatorships must prevent
them by force or run the risk of
withering away. Yet one may
wonder, in the light of Prof. Ba
ran’s and Prof. Swee/.y’s answer
in this Tuesday’s Daily, if any
real purpose is to be served by
discussing the Cuban issue with
those who “have never made any
secret” of their "desire to advance
and develop the ideas of Marxism
and socialism in this country and
elsewhere.”

Tho trouble is that such a dis
cussion is likely to be more “vig
orous” than “open” and if we may
judge by Tuesday’s letter, pre
senting the socialist “reply” to
Prof. Shaw’s arguments, it is cer
tain to be protean, if nothing else.
Let me illustrate briefly what I
mean. Prof. Shaw apparently be
lieves not only in open and vig
orous but also fair and thorough
discussion of controversial issues.
The other side apparently be
lieves in partial rather than com
plete presentation, in debaters’
tricks rather than careful and
complete examination of the evi
dence. It is hardly surprising if
Prof. Baran’s and Prof. Sweezy’s
“reply” bears some resemblance
to a juggling act.
Prof. Shaw, in his old-fashioned
way, believes in trying to lay bare
the whole truth, not just the part
of it favorable to his side in the
discussion. Consequently, he
makes a number of "concessions”
about past errors in American
policy in Cuba. Do his opponents
make any concessions of “wrong
turns” or tragic mistakes in pol
icy by socialist states, such as
the USSR, or indeed Castro’s
Cuba itself? By no means do they
do this; they are far too busy
seizing on Prof. Shaw’s “conces
sions” and attempting to turn
them against him. They appear
to believe further that the Mar
shall Plan was “a measure for
shoring up capitalist ruling
classes both here and abroad.”
The United States, they say, “un
der its present social structure, is
an imperialist country.” And the
naval base at Guantanamo Bay
is “a symbol of American imperi
alism in the Caribbean . . They
maintain also that “it is not true,
as Prof. Shaw asserts, that in our
last analysis, ‘the United States
can have no con’ect policy toward
Cuba.’ ”
Now, as A1 Smith, an American
even more old-fashioned than
Prof. Shaw, used to say, “Let’s
look at the record.” Prof. Baran
and Sweezy concede no socialist
mistakes but that does not mean
there were none. The United

States is accused of “shoring up
capitalist ruling clases” but noth
ing is admitted about socialist
efforts in behalf of socialist mili
tary coups- in Korea, in Vietnam,
in Laos, and, of all places, in
Cuba, where a good deal of loud
socialist sabre rattling has been
done in the last year. Though the
United States is called “an impe
rialist country,’’ nothing seems to
be said about Red Chinese ven
tures in Tibet and India, in addi
tion to places already named. Nor
have we forgotten those self-sac
rificing Chinese "volunteers” in
the Korean War, which was a
socialistic war of imperialist ag
gression. There is an old Anglo-
Saxon (this is a cuss word in
Russian) legal principle to the
effect that a plaintiff must come
into court with clean hands. For
anyone working to “advance and
develop the ideas of Marxism and
socialism in this country and
everywhere else” to talk about
American imperialism, without
offering a word of apology about
the bloody, imperialist conquest
of Hungary, and the repression
of the other imperialist holdings
of the leading socialist state is
an act of audacious but quite fa
miliar effrontery. It would be in
teresting to have Hungary ex
plained, from the socialist posi
tion, but it is not to be expected
that this will he done.
As for Prof. Baran and Swee
zy’s insistence that Prof. Shaw is
wrong and that the United States
could have a correct policy toward
Cuba, it is clear what this means.
All we have to do is agree with
them; so easily can a “correct
policy” be achieved.
Yet we should perhaps be pa
tient. The most strongly social
istic countries are those which
have most recently emerged from
despotism and which only the
other day began to shake off the
strangle-hold of poverty, ignor
ance. and superstition. Not one
of them, so far as I know, has
yet succeeded in establishing a
society in which, while the will

of the majority prevails, the
rights of the minority are pro
tected; in which, while the wel
fare of society as a whole is
steadily advanced, the freedom
and dignity of the individual are
maintained; and in which politi
cal discussions can be not only
open and vigorous but devoted
to the search for the whole truth.
Until socialism, in Cuba or else
where, achieves more freedom, I
shall not be much impressed by
one-sided and unsupported accu
sations of imperialism or even by
the most enthusiastic eulogies of
Fidel Castro as a new apostle of
the Rights of Man.

Why must we be exposed to

The stories from this trash book
were worse than many that ap

parent that the Chaparral must
depend upon sex to bolster its
circulation. How did this last
issue avoid censorship? Such filth
must be stopped. I propose that
there be either stricter censorship
or the abolishment of the maga

People will lose track of their
ideals if they let their sensual
desires overshadow their aca

should make a public apology.
The girls are not all ravishing,
but they are generally good con
versationalists and companions
and are altogether quite suitable.
Let us cast aside these insults
to our school, and let us remem
ber that we are here not for sex,
but for intellectual pursuit.

done in the last year. Though the
United States is called “an impe
rialist country,’’ nothing seems to
be said about Red Chinese ven
tures in Tibet and India, in addi
tion to places already named. Nor
have we forgotten those self-sac
rificing Chinese "volunteers” in
the Korean War, which was a
socialistic war of imperialist ag
gression. There is an old Anglo-
Saxon (this is a cuss word in
Russian) legal principle to the
effect that a plaintiff must come
into court with clean hands. For
anyone working to “advance and
develop the ideas of Marxism and
socialism in this country and
everywhere else” to talk about
American imperialism, without
offering a word of apology about
the bloody, imperialist conquest
of Hungary, and the repression
of the other imperialist holdings
of the leading socialist state is
an act of audacious but quite fa
miliar effrontery. It would be in
teresting to have Hungary ex
plained, from the socialist posi
tion, but it is not to be expected
that this will he done.
As for Prof. Baran and Swee
zy’s insistence that Prof. Shaw is
wrong and that the United States
could have a correct policy toward
Cuba, it is clear what this means.
All we have to do is agree with
them; so easily can a “correct
policy” be achieved.
Yet we should perhaps be pa
tient. The most strongly social
istic countries are those which
have most recently emerged from
despotism and which only the
other day began to shake off the
strangle-hold of poverty, ignor
ance. and superstition. Not one
of them, so far as I know, has
yet succeeded in establishing a
society in which, while the will

of the majority prevails, the
rights of the minority are pro
tected; in which, while the wel
fare of society as a whole is
steadily advanced, the freedom
and dignity of the individual are
maintained; and in which politi
cal discussions can be not only
open and vigorous but devoted
to the search for the whole truth.
Until socialism, in Cuba or else
where, achieves more freedom, I
shall not be much impressed by
one-sided and unsupported accu
sations of imperialism or even by
the most enthusiastic eulogies of
Fidel Castro as a new apostle of
the Rights of Man.

Not For Sex
Why must we be exposed to
the baseness of the Chaparral?
The stories from this trash book
were worse than many that ap
pear in “dime novels.” It is ap
parent that the Chaparral must
depend upon sex to bolster its
circulation. How did this last
issue avoid censorship? Such filth
must be stopped. I propose that
there be either stricter censorship
or the abolishment of the maga
zine entirely.
People will lose track of their
ideals if they let their sensual
desires overshadow their aca
demic endeavourings. The Stan
ford women were unfairly treat
ed, and I think the Chaparral
should make a public apology.
The girls are not all ravishing,
but they are generally good con
versationalists and companions
and are altogether quite suitable.
Let us cast aside these insults
to our school, and let us remem
ber that we are here not for sex,
but for intellectual pursuit.

Debaters' Tricks
Prof. E. S. Shaw is to be con
gratulated for his excellent state
ment in The Stanford Daily of
May 8, replying to some of the
views recently expressed by Prof.
Paul A. Baran and Professor
Paul M. Sweezy. To my knowl
edge many members of the Stan
ford faculty warmly approve
Prof, Shaw’s stand and 1 have no
doubt that a great many others
would state the case even more
strongly than he did. Most of the
faculty would also agree with all
three economists in their desire
for wider participation in “open
and vigorous political discussion”
at Stanford. Democracies thrive
on free and open discussions, just
as dictatorships must prevent
them by force or run the risk of
withering away. Yet one may
wonder, in the light of Prof. Ba
ran’s and Prof. Swee/.y’s answer
in this Tuesday’s Daily, if any
real purpose is to be served by
discussing the Cuban issue with
those who “have never made any
secret” of their "desire to advance
and develop the ideas of Marxism
and socialism in this country and
elsewhere.”

Tho trouble is that such a dis
cussion is likely to be more “vig
orous” than “open” and if we may
judge by Tuesday’s letter, pre
senting the socialist “reply” to
Prof. Shaw’s arguments, it is cer
tain to be protean, if nothing else.
Let me illustrate briefly what I
mean. Prof. Shaw apparently be
lieves not only in open and vig
orous but also fair and thorough
discussion of controversial issues.
The other side apparently be
lieves in partial rather than com
plete presentation, in debaters’
tricks rather than careful and
complete examination of the evi
dence. It is hardly surprising if
Prof. Baran’s and Prof. Sweezy’s
“reply” bears some resemblance
to a juggling act.
Prof. Shaw, in his old-fashioned
way, believes in trying to lay bare
the whole truth, not just the part
of it favorable to his side in the
discussion. Consequently, he
makes a number of "concessions”
about past errors in American
policy in Cuba. Do his opponents
make any concessions of “wrong
turns” or tragic mistakes in pol
icy by socialist states, such as
the USSR, or indeed Castro’s
Cuba itself? By no means do they
do this; they are far too busy
seizing on Prof. Shaw’s “conces
sions” and attempting to turn
them against him. They appear
to believe further that the Mar
shall Plan was “a measure for
shoring up capitalist ruling
classes both here and abroad.”
The United States, they say, “un
der its present social structure, is
an imperialist country.” And the
naval base at Guantanamo Bay
is “a symbol of American imperi
alism in the Caribbean . . They
maintain also that “it is not true,
as Prof. Shaw asserts, that in our
last analysis, ‘the United States
can have no con’ect policy toward
Cuba.’ ”
Now, as A1 Smith, an American
even more old-fashioned than
Prof. Shaw, used to say, “Let’s
look at the record.” Prof. Baran
and Sweezy concede no socialist
mistakes but that does not mean
there were none. The United

States is accused of “shoring up
capitalist ruling clases” but noth
ing is admitted about socialist
efforts in behalf of socialist mili
tary coups- in Korea, in Vietnam,
in Laos, and, of all places, in
Cuba, where a good deal of loud
socialist sabre rattling has been
done in the last year. Though the
United States is called “an impe
rialist country,’’ nothing seems to
be said about Red Chinese ven
tures in Tibet and India, in addi
tion to places already named. Nor
