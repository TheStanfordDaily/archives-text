# END SPRING DRILLS
## Varsity Meets Alumni In Grid Classic 
### ROY SCHMIDT 
It'll be the old versus the new when the Indians square off
against a star-studded lineup of former Stanford greats for the third
annual Alumni-Football Game in the Stadium tomorrow at 3:45 p.m.
The Indian varsity will not only be running from an all-new

offense but the lineup will include
only two familiar faces from last
year, Steve Pursell who will again
man left end and Chris Cottle at
center.
THE REMAINDER of the line
up will include Chris Jessen at
right end. Randy Vahan and Jack
Gordon at tackles, Starr Rounds
and Wayne Favlic at guards, Rod
Sears at quarterback, Gary Craig
and Danny Spence at hails, and
Hal Steuber at full.
Jessen. Pavlic, and Spence will
all be doning varsity jerseys for
the first time, having played JV
ball last season. The others all
earned letters but saw limited ac
tion for the Indians in 19(50.
Biggest problem for Coach Jack
Curtice will he replacing his en
tire first string backfield, all of
whom will graduate in June.
Sears has been playing in the
shadow of Dick Norman for two
years and should he ready to come
into his own. The hopeful junior
was fourth in total offense last
year with 249 yards . in eight
games. While he didn’t match the
polished passing of Norman,
Sears proved to bo a greater
threat in the running game, and
should adapt easily to the new
array of rollouts and running
passes.
AFTER A YEAR’S absence
from the gridiron, Jim Smith will
return for a crack at the quarter
back spot. Smith, who earned his
football letter in 1959, is currently
pitching for the Stanford varsity
baseball team and won’t be avail
able until next year.
Freshman star Steve Thurlow
has showed unusual polish in
spring drills considering his ex
perience. Last season he led the
frosh team in scoring with 14
points, total offense with 278
yards, and passing, completing
11 of 28 for 212 yards.
Lettermen Bob Price and Gary
Sargeant should also see consider
able action. Sargeant will play on
the number one defensive unit re
placing Sears.
Craig, a junior, averaged a
whopping eight yards per carry
last year and has not shown signs
of letting up this spring. Right
behind him is Larry Royse, one of
the fastest men on the squad, who
sat out most of last year with an
injured hand.
A SURPRISE starter at right
half, Spence earned his crack at
the starting assignment this
spring with his impressive break

away running.
Spring drills also turned up two
bright prospects among the fresh
man in Tyce Fit/,morris and Mike
Barnes, both of whom averaged
over six yards per carry last sea
son. Barnes, a fullback, will miss
tomorrow’s game because of ill
ness, but Fitzmorris should see
plenty of action. Stan Lindskog
and Ed Cummings, lettermen
from 1960 will also work at the
halfback spots.

In Steuber the Cards will have
a hard-hitting fullback who aver
aged 4.65 yards per carry playing
behind Skip Face last year.
UP FRONT Cottle and Pursell
will be the stalwarts of a young
and rather green line. Pursell, in
addition to his fine blocking,
caught five passes for 83 yards
last year.
Vahan, Rounds, and Gordon all
lettered last year, while Pavilic
will be attempting to make the big
jump from frosh ball in one sea
son.

ALSO BATTLING for team
berths will be six promising fresh
men, Mike Dowling, Kent Colberg,
Frank Duhofsky, Marv Harris,

Garry Lofgren, and Dick Leeu
wenburg, Louie Adams, Frank
Patitucci, Charles McCormick and
Ken Fraser.
Coach Curtice, trying to adapt
his system to the material, has
shifted to what he calls a spread
split-T with all three running
backs lined up behind the quarter
back. From this formation the
Cards will be able to do more run
ning, and will add more finesse to
their aerial attack with action
passes.
The alumni lineup will be led by
quarterback Dick Norman, the
nation’s leading passer in 1959.
Norman will team with ends Carl
Issacs and Irv Nicolai in what
promises to be a potent passing
threat.
The remainder of the alumni
lineup will be Troy Barbee and
Eric Protiva at tackles, Norm Ma
noogian and Don Peter at guards,
Doug Pursell at center. Ron Cook
and Mac Wylie at halfbacks and
Chuck Shea at full.
