# New Setting At Frost Amphitheater Puts Spring Sing In Different Light
## 
### 
The stage at Frost Amphithea
ter is literally “set” for tonight’s
entertainment, which will be pro
vided by the twenty-three singing
groups competing in this year’s
annual Spring Sing.
The audience may be surprised
to find that Frost has undergone
a timely transformation, due to
the forthcoming Stanford Play
ers’ production of “Peer Gynt.” In
addition to scenery, “Peer Gynt’s”
excellent lighting set-up will be
utilized by the Sing’s lighting
crew for special effects.
THK SING Committee has cho
sen (he twenty-three competing
groups from thirty-five entrants,
all of whom, says Committee
Chairman Marshall Turner, were
“good enough to win a place in
last year’s Sing.” To judge from
this, it looks as though the audi
ence is assured of only the very
best in entertainment.

Besides the competitive groups,
three trios will help MC Drew Fa
gen in entertaining during the
breaks in the program.
JUDGING of the groups is
based on the total points each
group receives, points being given
for such ; things as originality and
appearance, as well as for the
over all performance. Points are
Subtracted for groups who go
over the stated time limit, which
includes the time for entrance and
for exit.

Winners' I r o p h i e s will be
awarded by the judges themselves

I this year, as all the judges are
well-known personalities, includ
ing Tommy Harris of "Tommy’s
jjoynt,” KABL’s program direc
tor Alan Hart. Sylvester Grisby,
and the president of the San Fran
cisco Conservatory of Music, Dr.
Robin Lauser.
Ushering for tonight's program,
which will begin at 7:30, is pro
vided by Rally Com, headed by
| Roger Salquist and Bill Warren.


Getting in tune for Spring Sing are the Alpha Delts, conducted by Larry Oderdonkt, who
will contribute their "Abstracts on American Cultural Themes, Opus No. 6" to the program.
