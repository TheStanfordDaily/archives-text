# Golfers Defend Title

Looking for their second AAWU golf championship in two years,
Stanford's undefeated golf team began play today in the grueling
72-hole Big Five tournament on the Ranier Country Club course in
Seattle.
Kent Winton, Bill Parish, Bill Welch, Phil Underwood, Steve Smith

and Ralph Marron teed off for the
Cards in this morning’s 18 holes,
to he followed by another 18 this
afternoon and the two final
rounds tomorrow.
The low four scores will count
in the team standings and last
year the Indians won the event
with a total of 1192 strokes, 41
shots ahead of UCLA, their near
est competitor, and Stanford’s :
best four swingers were bracketed
among the five low Individual |
scorers,
Stanford wall be heavily fav
ored to repeat on the basis of their
11 win and no loss record for the
current season, including dual
match victories over all of their
AAWU foes except Washington.
WINTON, who finished third in
the 1960 league individual compe
tition, and Smith, who was fifth
and finished second in the NCAA
championships, have sparked the
locals to their winning season
along with Farish, who has been a
consistent victor in the number
one position.
Biggest threat to Coach Bud
Finger’s charges will come from
UCLA as the Cards just managed
to sneak by the Bruins when the
two teams met on the Farm links |
two weeks ago. Smith sank a six j
foot putt on the 18th green in the !
final match to give Stanford a
narrow 14li-12 ] -> triumph.
Washington has a darkhorse
role on the strength of the north
erners’ third place finish last year,
just three strokes behind the
Bruins. Southern Cal took fourth
in the ’6O AAWU event and Cal
finished last.
