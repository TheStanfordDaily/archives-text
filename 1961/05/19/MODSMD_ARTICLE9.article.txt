13-1 a motion to censure Efron
and withhold his May salary);
this action was reversed by Dean
. . . VVinbigler.
“WE WISH to protest the usur
pation of our traditional juris
diction in such matters.”

motion. He said his reason for
requesting action was that Win
bigler “bypassed” the student or
ganizations set up to handle stu
dent affairs.
Other LASSU members disa
greed, saying LASSU had taken
no action on the matter. Educa
tion School Rep Don Warren said
(he group had been a “tower of
jolly” on the Chappie controversy,
and no purpose would bo served
by adopting the resolution.
IN OTHER action, LASSU put
off until next week discussion on
a proposal to seat a male and a
