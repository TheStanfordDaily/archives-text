INVESTMENT ANALYSIS must fascinate any
thinking man. Whatever happens in any part of
the world is related to the value of securities—
upheaval in the Congo, formation of the European
Common Market, Communist economic policies,
military aggression in the East—all have an in
fluence upon the value of stocks and bonds on
the New York Stock Exchange and the Over-the-
Counter markets. In no other field of investigation
—not even journalism—can a man find such quick

If an analyst fails to receive the minimum ad
vance indicated by this schedule, he will be on
notice that his resignation is desired. It is prob
able that of those who are accepted most can and

In addition to the salary, the company pro
vides a profit sharing plan which, under the mini
mum salary schedules, should result in providing
a capital fund of around $35,000 to $50,000 (as
a long term capital gain) at the end of the twelfth
year of employment.
To a small number of men who are about to
graduate from college and who have proved by
their scholastic records that they are capable of
doing hard, intelligent w’ork, the Value Line In
vestment Survey, one of the world’s foremost in
vestment advisory services, offers the following;
(1) a six-months course of training in security
analysis, taught by the head of the Value Line
organization and its top editor-analysts.

For three months during the tuition period
from July 15th to October 15th—$300.00 per

INVESTMENT ANALYSIS must fascinate any
thinking man. Whatever happens in any part of
the world is related to the value of securities—
upheaval in the Congo, formation of the European
Common Market, Communist economic policies,
military aggression in the East—all have an in
fluence upon the value of stocks and bonds on
the New York Stock Exchange and the Over-the-
Counter markets. In no other field of investigation
—not even journalism—can a man find such quick
identification with world-wide affairs as in the
stock marker.
If an analyst fails to receive the minimum ad
vance indicated by this schedule, he will be on
notice that his resignation is desired. It is prob
able that of those who are accepted most can and
will go ahead faster than shown in this schedule.
In addition to the salary, the company pro
vides a profit sharing plan which, under the mini
mum salary schedules, should result in providing
a capital fund of around $35,000 to $50,000 (as
a long term capital gain) at the end of the twelfth
year of employment.
To a small number of men who are about to
graduate from college and who have proved by
their scholastic records that they are capable of
doing hard, intelligent w’ork, the Value Line In
vestment Survey, one of the world’s foremost in
vestment advisory services, offers the following;
(1) a six-months course of training in security
analysis, taught by the head of the Value Line
organization and its top editor-analysts.
(2) the following minimum salary schedules:
For three months during the tuition period
from July 15th to October 15th—$300.00 per
month.
For the next three months’ apprenticeship,
October 15th to January 15th—$100.00 per
month.

The increases in pay
arc, of course, accompa
nied by promotions in title and responsibility as
well. In perhaps no other securities research or
ganization can the exceptionally able analyst ad
vance so rapidly to a position of meaningful re
sponsibility and stature.
In addition, the company provides, entirely at
company expense, the following insurance bene
fits; hospitalization, accident, major medical and
life.
