# Students Evaluate Advisors by Questionnaire
## 
### ILENE STRELITZ Managing Editor 
Fouv weeks ago six hundred Stanford stu
dents took part in a program that has re
ceived administrative consideration parallel
to the survey four years ago which brought
the general studies program into considera
tion- and its effects could well be equally
strongly felt.
THREE HUNDRED freshman, and one
hundred each of sophomores, juniors and
seniors received a questionnaire entitled “An
Evaluation of Undergraduate Advising.” The
form was the product of the Stanford Com
mittee on Advising headed by Registrar Har
vey Hall.

The questionnaire came
and went before anyone had
a chance to discover how
many of his friends had also
received one, and before any
bull sessions to compare
complaints and compliments
could come into being. There
was a reason for the quiet
ness and lack of publicity.
“We wanted to get, as far as
p os s i b 1 e, individual reac
tions uninhibited by the atti-

tudes of other students. There was evidence
that many students thought the system and
its performance work pretty well. This is not
what we get from bull sessions, where the

unfavorable is pushed to light.”
And the replies brought frank statistics
and even franker written comments which
are each being typed up to help categorize
the criticism under the leadership of a mem
ber of the Journalism Department.
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY students found
their advisors lacking in providing help for
long range objective to 162 who found help
in this dilection, while 316 found the advisor
equipped with adequate information about
General Studies compared to 76 who didn’t.
Two hundred forty-two students stated
that their advisor seemed to have a personal
interest in them while 149 termed this miss
ing, yet 275 students failed to make one or
more advance appointments to see the ad
visor at times other than registration or pre
registration as compared to 126 who did.
One of the most decisive answers provided
by the survey was the overwhelming 301 stu
dents who declared that their advisor does a
satisfactory job of accomplishing the pur
poses outlined in the statement concerning
advising included on the form, as compared
to 91 who did not.
BACKING Ul* this figure with the highest
division of replies were the 374 students ap
proving of the stated goals of advising to 16
who did not.

In part, the statement reads as follows:
. . you must take the initiative in seeking
out your advisor. Primarily his purpose is

to assist you in selecting an appropriate aca
demic program. . . .
"The long-range objective of a good advis
ing system is to bring the student to the point
where he can assume a maximum amount of
responsibility for his own academic program
and can make wise decisions of his own . . .

student should be made to feel as soon as
possible that his intellectual development is
his own responsibility. The advisor should
not be expected to relieve the student of re
sponsibility for decisions. . . .”
Hall reacted to this response in saying,

“There is enough favorable comment so that
the advisors won’t feel overwhelmed with
despair, but there are enough criticisms to
make them aware. We don’t anticipate a ma
jor change in the organization of the system,
but we do want to try to minimize errors and
omissions on the part of individual advisors.”

AS AN over-all, 206 students found their
general studies advisor adequate, 111 inade
quate, and 57 unnecesary, while 198 found
their major advisor adequate, 79 inadequate,
and 32 unnecessary.

Summed up in Hall’s words, “The chief
faults of the advisory system are at the g’’ass
roots level. People get busy, do a good job
of advising, but it could be at cost to them
selves and their careers.
“For whatever reason, there are individ
uals not doing as well as they could which
gives the whole program a blackeye. There

is a problem on a dynamic campus of a largo
turnover—people leaving for overseas cam
puses, traveling, visiting on other campuses.
Now people find themselves concerned, as ad
visors, with so much minutia that they have
difficulty going much beyond the mechanics
of the job. When people know the details
well enough, they have time for something
else.”
The advisory committee, a subcommittee
of the General Studies Committee, finds tho
conducting of this survey well within their
range of activities. The seven members—
Registrar Hall, Professors Farnsworth, Grom
mon, McCluney, Regnery. Vennard, and
Walker- perform two on-going functions as
a committee: seeking ways and means of im
proving advising in general, and acting on
individual petitions to deviate from the gen
eral studies program.
When queried as to what actions the re
sults of the questionnaire would bring, the
committee issued the following statement:
“MEMBERS of the Committee on Advising
think the results of the questionnaire afford
a constructive basis for improvement of the
program. For example, it is clear that too
many students find their advisors ill-in
formed about the General Studies require
ments, and certainly much more needs to be
done about planning long-range educational
objectives. Something can and should be done
about both of these matters.

“On the other hand, the widespread ap
proval of the present definition of the func
tion of the advisor does indicate that we do
have a basis for bettor understanding be
tween students and advisors than we have
had in the past. The committee hopes this
understanding is fully recognized by students
and faculty. .. .
“Generally speaking, members of the com
mittee were heartened that expressions of
disapproval (though some were harsh and
personal) were matched by voluntary com
ments expressing appreciation for a job well
done. On the whole, it appears that advisors
and students both should understand better
what should be expected of advisors; that
some advisors need to be better informed;
that advisors should be available at regular
times; that students should take some initia
tive in consulting their advisors at less busy
times; and that long-term planning is not
happening often enough.
“WK CONCLUDE that problems and
shortcomings certainly do exist in present ad
vising, but most seem to be of an individual
nature rather than in the organization or
structure of the advising system. The com
mittee, however, will continue to exploit?
ways of improving the system and its func
tion.”

Hall reacted to this response in saying,

AS AN over-all, 206 students found their
general studies advisor adequate, 111 inade
quate, and 57 unnecesary, while 198 found
their major advisor adequate, 79 inadequate,

Summed up in Hall’s words, “The chief
faults of the advisory system are at the g’’ass

of advising, but it could be at cost to them
selves and their careers.
“For whatever reason, there are individ
uals not doing as well as they could which

is a problem on a dynamic campus of a largo
turnover—people leaving for overseas cam
puses, traveling, visiting on other campuses.
Now people find themselves concerned, as ad

difficulty going much beyond the mechanics

proving advising in general, and acting on
individual petitions to deviate from the gen
eral studies program.
When queried as to what actions the re
sults of the questionnaire would bring, the
committee issued the following statement:
“MEMBERS of the Committee on Advising
think the results of the questionnaire afford
a constructive basis for improvement of the
program. For example, it is clear that too
many students find their advisors ill-in
formed about the General Studies require
ments, and certainly much more needs to be
done about planning long-range educational
objectives. Something can and should be done
about both of these matters.

“On the other hand, the widespread ap
proval of the present definition of the func
tion of the advisor does indicate that we do
have a basis for bettor understanding be
tween students and advisors than we have
had in the past. The committee hopes this
understanding is fully recognized by students
and faculty. .. .
“Generally speaking, members of the com
mittee were heartened that expressions of
disapproval (though some were harsh and
personal) were matched by voluntary com
ments expressing appreciation for a job well
done. On the whole, it appears that advisors
and students both should understand better
what should be expected of advisors; that
some advisors need to be better informed;
that advisors should be available at regular
times; that students should take some initia
tive in consulting their advisors at less busy
times; and that long-term planning is not
happening often enough.
“WK CONCLUDE that problems and
shortcomings certainly do exist in present ad

their major advisor adequate, 79 inadequate,

Summed up in Hall’s words, “The chief

of advising, but it could be at cost to them
selves and their careers.
“For whatever reason, there are individ

is a problem on a dynamic campus of a largo
turnover—people leaving for overseas cam

Now people find themselves concerned, as ad

difficulty going much beyond the mechanics
of the job. When people know the details
well enough, they have time for something

proving advising in general, and acting on

eral studies program.
When queried as to what actions the re
sults of the questionnaire would bring, the
committee issued the following statement:
“MEMBERS of the Committee on Advising
think the results of the questionnaire afford
a constructive basis for improvement of the
program. For example, it is clear that too
many students find their advisors ill-in
formed about the General Studies require
ments, and certainly much more needs to be
done about planning long-range educational
objectives. Something can and should be done
about both of these matters.

“On the other hand, the widespread ap
proval of the present definition of the func
tion of the advisor does indicate that we do
have a basis for bettor understanding be
tween students and advisors than we have
had in the past. The committee hopes this
understanding is fully recognized by students
and faculty. .. .
“Generally speaking, members of the com
mittee were heartened that expressions of
disapproval (though some were harsh and
personal) were matched by voluntary com
ments expressing appreciation for a job well
done. On the whole, it appears that advisors
and students both should understand better
what should be expected of advisors; that
some advisors need to be better informed;
that advisors should be available at regular
times; that students should take some initia
tive in consulting their advisors at less busy
times; and that long-term planning is not
happening often enough.
“WK CONCLUDE that problems and
shortcomings certainly do exist in present ad

BACKING Ul* this figure with the highest
division of replies were the 374 students ap
proving of the stated goals of advising to 16
who did not.

In part, the statement reads as follows:
. . you must take the initiative in seeking
out your advisor. Primarily his purpose is

to assist you in selecting an appropriate aca
demic program. . . .
"The long-range objective of a good advis
ing system is to bring the student to the point
where he can assume a maximum amount of
responsibility for his own academic program
and can make wise decisions of his own . . .

student should be made to feel as soon as
possible that his intellectual development is
his own responsibility. The advisor should
not be expected to relieve the student of re
sponsibility for decisions. . . .”
Hall reacted to this response in saying,

“There is enough favorable comment so that
the advisors won’t feel overwhelmed with
despair, but there are enough criticisms to
make them aware. We don’t anticipate a ma
jor change in the organization of the system,
but we do want to try to minimize errors and
omissions on the part of individual advisors.”

AS AN over-all, 206 students found their
general studies advisor adequate, 111 inade
quate, and 57 unnecesary, while 198 found
their major advisor adequate, 79 inadequate,
and 32 unnecessary.

Summed up in Hall’s words, “The chief
faults of the advisory system are at the g’’ass
roots level. People get busy, do a good job
of advising, but it could be at cost to them
selves and their careers.
“For whatever reason, there are individ
uals not doing as well as they could which
gives the whole program a blackeye. There

is a problem on a dynamic campus of a largo
turnover—people leaving for overseas cam
puses, traveling, visiting on other campuses.
Now people find themselves concerned, as ad
visors, with so much minutia that they have
difficulty going much beyond the mechanics
of the job. When people know the details
well enough, they have time for something
else.”
The advisory committee, a subcommittee
of the General Studies Committee, finds tho
conducting of this survey well within their
range of activities. The seven members—
Registrar Hall, Professors Farnsworth, Grom
mon, McCluney, Regnery. Vennard, and
Walker- perform two on-going functions as
a committee: seeking ways and means of im
proving advising in general, and acting on
individual petitions to deviate from the gen
eral studies program.
When queried as to what actions the re
sults of the questionnaire would bring, the
committee issued the following statement:
“MEMBERS of the Committee on Advising
think the results of the questionnaire afford
a constructive basis for improvement of the
program. For example, it is clear that too
many students find their advisors ill-in
formed about the General Studies require
ments, and certainly much more needs to be
done about planning long-range educational
objectives. Something can and should be done
about both of these matters.

“On the other hand, the widespread ap
proval of the present definition of the func
tion of the advisor does indicate that we do
have a basis for bettor understanding be
tween students and advisors than we have
had in the past. The committee hopes this
understanding is fully recognized by students
and faculty. .. .
“Generally speaking, members of the com
mittee were heartened that expressions of
disapproval (though some were harsh and
personal) were matched by voluntary com
ments expressing appreciation for a job well
done. On the whole, it appears that advisors
and students both should understand better
what should be expected of advisors; that
some advisors need to be better informed;
that advisors should be available at regular
times; that students should take some initia
tive in consulting their advisors at less busy
times; and that long-term planning is not
happening often enough.
“WK CONCLUDE that problems and
shortcomings certainly do exist in present ad
vising, but most seem to be of an individual
nature rather than in the organization or
structure of the advising system. The com
mittee, however, will continue to exploit?
ways of improving the system and its func
tion.”
