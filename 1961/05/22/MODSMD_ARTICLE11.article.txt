# Second Date Set For Spring Sing
## 
### 
The annual Spring Sing, can
celled last Friday because of rain,
will be held this Sunday, Chair
man Marshall Turner announced
last night.
At 11 a.m. Friday the Spring
Sing Committee called off the
event in the face of rain clouds,
a muddy amphitheatre and no
alternative place of presentation.
“Acoustics arc poor at the sta
dium, the basketball pavilion has
i limited space and Mem And is
I in use,” stated Turner.
Because the committee waited
until the last possible moment to
I make the decision, the change of
■ date did not appear in Friday’s
Daily.
