# STANFORD-THE 'OTHER-DIRECTED UNIVERSITY?
## What is the Stanford Image? PACE Rumors Charge Suppression 
### 
"It is inconceivable that the University's public relations may be
maintained only by discouraging freedom of thought, a policy which
is antithetical to the highest goals of any educational institution."
—Letter to the Editor, reprinted in the
Stanford Daily of Tuesday, May 16.
"Why not... insure the proper censorship required by the PACE
program?" — Letter to the Editor reprinted in the
Stanford Daily, Tuesday, May 16.
Comments like these are coming each day in large groups to the
Daily Shack. All over the campus the same comments are heard.
Everything from the Chappie suspension to the barring of Robert
Welch from a campus appearance has been attributed to the Admin
istration's desire to keep from offending any possible donor to the
PACE campaign.
In the words of one campus administrator who prefers to remain
anonymous, "Every time the campus hosts a controversial speaker,
that is, one who is an extremist in one direction or the other, approxi
mately a quarter of a million dollars is lost to the University in alumni
contributions."
Three top-level University offices mentioned the phrase, "the
Stanford image," and expressed concern over its current appearance.
These reactions, together with the absence of such speakers as
Bircher Robert Welch and Fulton Lewis 111, each of whose appear
ance was planned by campus organizations, have aroused campus
suspicions. The common fear is that the effects of the PACE drive
upon the Administration have resulted in intellectual suppression.
This charge has brought to mind a query that is reverberating
from the Quad to the lake-bed: Will the end justify the means?
Somehow it is hard to accept the belief that Stanford alumni,
products of the wide scope of the Stanford curriculum, would emerge
narrow-minded enough to condemn controversial campus political
activity by refusing to support the University.
With the rumors flying fast and furiously, with PACE becoming
an object of bitterness, and with the alumni bearing an attack on their
intellectual integrity, the time came to approach the people named
in the suppression charges and ask frank questions.
The statements of those approached appear on this page. Most
rumors were cleared up completely and were clearly shown to be
unsubstantiated. For those that remain vague, there are but two com
ments to be made.
First, if Stanford is truly functioning as the "other-directed uni
versity" geared solely to presenting a satisfactory "Stanford image,"
the PACE drive is useless. If Stanford is merely trying to meet its
financial needs but is opposed by the dogmatic beliefs held by the
very people it spent four years educating, we should all give up,
forget about the PACE drive, close our doors, and seek a university
from which we will emerge as thinking people.
