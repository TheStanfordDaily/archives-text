# 'Bucks' Should End Grants to Athletes
## 
### 
Giving financial aid to athletes is a big business at Stanford.
This aid is an unfortunate misdirection of money.

Most of the dollars reserved for athletes come from the Buck
Club, whose members contribute $lOO,OOO annually to help students
with athletic ability. The University distributes the money as grants
in-aid up to the amount of tuition. In accordance with the recom
mendations of the Department of Athletics, the awards go to the
athletes with the most athletic talent and financial need. The aca
demic criteria that are applied require only that the Office of Ad
missions admit the potential recipient and that he maintain a C
average after he gets here.
Although a group of alumni have every right to establish such
a grant-in-aid program, they should have the wisdom to establish or
perpetuate such a program. Instead, they should make a significant
contribution to higher education. If Stanford is to become a great
university, all of its alumni must recognize their responsibility to
interest outstanding students in Sanford and to aid the ones who are
needy. They should ignore the athletes who are not outstanding stu
dents. If this policy ends big-time athletics at Stanford, so much the
better.
Here is a challenge to the Buck Club. If the club believes what
its brochure implies, that outstanding athletes are often outstanding
students, then let the club redefine the criterion for its awards. Let
them make the criterion academic excellence with need presumed.
If the excellent athletes are often excellent students, a large number
of athletes will win grants-in-aid by their excellent scholarship.
If, however, only a few athletes win academic scholarships, the
Buck Club should admit its error and continue scholarships whose
criterion is scholarship. The Buck Club must discover whether its
assumptions are wrong and decide whether its criterion now distorts
the standard of values that a great university must serve.—N.H.W.
