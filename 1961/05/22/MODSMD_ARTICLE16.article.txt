By having debate on campus w r e
sometimes actually gain money.
The alleged loss of funds due to
campus controversy is a gross ex
aggeration. . . .
Certainly one could alienate a
certain opinion; we, though, have
been rather successful in getting
a variety of viewpoints expressed.
We do have trouble when
groups get off-base and don’t go
through regular student channels.
. . . Rumors get started and
they just keep getting repeated.. .
There has been more contro
versy on campus since this pro
gram started than at any time
during my 45 years here.
There have always been public
relations—there has been no sud
den new, different policy. In any
year, we are raising $l5 million
or so. . . .
There has always been concern
for public relations in general.
The last political election was
just a quieter year for contro
versy than '52. There was nothing
the administration did—it just
worked out that way. . . .
As for the Chappie-—tabulate
the years a Chappie or Daily edi
tor has been ousted in the past.
I can remember 1 h i s happen
ing to the Chappie as far back as
1917. It’s perennial. It’s the same
at the University of California and
everywhere else.
