### 
(Ed. note: This statement was
not submitted in written form hut
was given to the Daily by inter
view with the Freshman Edition
editorial board. Kemper. Freeman
is outgoing Alumni Association
president.)

“The winds of freedom blow,”
is the motto of the alumni as
well as of the University. , . .
The Alumni Association is an
independent organization we’re
lust all students who have been
at Stanford. . . .

There are reasons for limits
and laws. People shouldn’t com
mit crimes and be offensive; they
shouldn’t bo agents for any group
that advocates the destruction of
our government in favor of a
tyrannical government. . . .
There is no problem from the
alumni on liberalism, freedom, or
anything of that nature. Students
are just trying to read things into
administrative decisions.
