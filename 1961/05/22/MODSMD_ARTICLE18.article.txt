Let’s face it—we've got to think
about it (PACE). If we’re not
thinking about it, we’re not doing
our job.
We’ve known about PACE for
at least two years. We knew about
the possibility of a Ford Founda
tion grant two years before that,
j Any administration policy change
j would have started then, not now
jin the thick of the campaign. . . .
Robert Welch was being invited
not so that something could be
learned from him, but to heckle
him. If a person has something to
offer and if we can work him in
with the schedule and available
halls, he is seldom turned down.
There are a multitude of pro
grams going on constantly. This
place is in ferment!
There has certainly been no
real suppression!
. . . Fulton Lewis 111 is not an
authority. We don’t think he has
anything to offer in terms of edu
cation. , . .
Any problem of Stanford comes
from the fact that we are now
more in the public eye—not be
cause of PACE, but because we
are growing. Stanford just hasn’t
lived through this period of pub
lic view yet.

As for the alleged loss of alumni
gifts in the face of campus con
troversy, we must remember that
sometimes highly educated people
get fixed ideas—their world be
comes smaller. . . .
There are elderly alumni who
don’t like to see change. They too
want to see the University become
even greater, but they don’t like

|to see the intei’mediary steps.
There is a great difficulty in get
ting the alumni to participate
without their interfering with ev
erything.
Basically, of course, the alumni
do good things. . . .

As far as controversy involving
faculty goes, each year we have
a great many new faculty mem
bers who want to be accepted im
mediately—so they try to change
the world in their own image.
What we w'ant, though, is people
with enough guts to speak their
minds.

Maintenance of the “Stanford
[image” is not the major consid
| oration. It is, of course, a factor
that should enter people’s minds;
| i.e„ whether we’re behaving like
: human beings or jackasses.
[ The administrative policy is to
! get a good selection of points of
1 view on major issues.

When we do turn down a
speaker, it is because the timing is
wrong or there isn’t a hall avail
able. What we need are more fa
cilities.
