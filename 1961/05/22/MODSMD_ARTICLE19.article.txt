(Ed, noteiThis statement was
not submitted in written form but
was given to file Daily by inter
view with the Freshman Edition
editorial board. Agues Nohrnberg
is Director of Public Events, Pub
lic, Exercises Committee.)
At this moment in history,
Welch is not a man we should
have on campus.
There is no particular reason
but we must remember that the
possibility of poor attendance is a
factor in campus speeches.
Also, we have a very crowded
schedule; this is the kind of pro
gram apt to bring people from the
outside. It is also possible that
the committee felt the arrange
ments were not being handled
well.
We have to keep in mindâ€”what
kind of image would this create
in the community?
