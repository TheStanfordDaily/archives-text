# Varsity Trounces Alumni, 47-14; Spence Sparks Ground Attack
## Daily Sports 
### ROY SCHMIDT 
Showing surprising punch on
the ground, the Stanford varsity
claimed its first victory over the
alumni in thi'ee years Saturday as
they rolled up a 47-14 score.
The Indians dominated the
game in every department except
passing where Dick Norman re
turned to haunt them. The former
Card and the nation’s leading
passer in 1959 threw for 167 yards
and one of the two alumni touch
downs.
THE VARSITY running game,
never more than a secondary wea
pon before, blossomed into its
own, racking up 302 yards and ac
counting for five of the seven
scores. Leading rusher for the
Cards was Danny Spence who
picked up 64 yards in just three
tries for a phenomenal 20.67 yard
average. The sophomore speed
ster stunned the alumni defense
as he took a pitchout from quar
terback Rod Sears and weaved his
49 yards to the alum 18 before
finally being overtaken by John
Bessey on the second play of the
game.
The Indians capitalized on the
scoring opportunity five plays
later as fullback Hal Steuber
drove over from two yards out
after Sears had hit right half
Larry Royse with a bullet on the
one.
Spence, who also caught two
passes for 17 yards, was denied
his chance to get into the scoring
column when an off-side penalty
nullified his two-yard touchdown
jaunt late in the second quarter.
FRESHMAN quarterback Steve
Thurlow, showing surprising
poise in his first varsity game, en
gineered three scoring drives and
gained 51 yards on the ground in
four carries. Early in the second

quarter Thurlow, mixing his
plays well, pitched out to Royse
who swept around the right side,
eluded several alumni tacklers,
and dashed 34 yards for paydirt.
The run capped a 51-yard drive
which took seven plays.

Moments after the second half
kick-off, Royse picked off a stray
Jerry Gustafson pass and fought
his way hack for 10 yards to set
up the next score. Thurlow then
dropped back to pass, but finding
nobody in the open elected to run.
The fleet freshman started around
right end, cut inside and drove for
37 yards to the alumni 17. Gary
Craig then skirted right end for
the score.

Early in the final period an
other unknown. Jim Shroyer, a
JV from last year, teamed with
Thurlow in a drive that covered
67 yards in nine plays. Key play
in the march was a 31-yard Thur
low-Shroyer pass which moved the
ball to the alumni 32. Seven plays
later the same combo connected
again, this time from three yards
out for the sixth Stanford tally.
FIRST • STRING quarterback
Sears twisted an ankle late in the
second quarter and was forced to
sit out the remainder of the game.
The injury was not serious and it
enabled Coach Jack Curtice to get
a look at all his quarterback candi
dates. Six signal callers got a
chance although returning letter
man Gary Sargeant played only
on defense.

Aside from Thurlow and Sears,
Chuck Butler, Bob Price, and Reg
Rhodes made appearances, and all
three got into the scoring act.
Butler, who replaced Sears after
he turned his ankle, cracked over
from two yards out near the end
of the second quarter. Getting in
for the last two series, Price
sneaked over from inches out
after Royse had intercepted his
second alumni pass and returned
it 53 yards. Rhodes then came off

the bench and carried over for the
two-point conversion.
Sears led the quarterback con
tingent in passing, completing
four of five for 42 yards. Butler
led in yardage with 55 but com
pleted just four of nine attempts.
THE VARSITY defense picked
off five alumni aerials and added
one touchdown on Steve Pursell’s
23-yard romp with the third stray
pass by Gustafson.
Norman, who seemingly has a
clear shot at the quarterback spot
for the Chicago Bears of the Na
tional Football League, was on
the mark as he passed to John
Bond for one touchdown and set
up the other with a 39-yard pitch
to Bossey.

THE ALUMNI was unable to
muster an effective rushing at
tack against the Cardinal defense
and picked up only 13 yards in
the first half and 44 overall. Mac
Wylie and Rich McMillan led in
that department with 29 and 26
yards respectively, both on four
carries.

For Coach Jack Curtice it was
his first win since November 14,
1959, when fullback Skip Face
scored 27 poins to spatrk the In
dians to a 39-22 victory over Ore
gon State in Corvallis.

Craig then skirted right end for
the score.

Early in the final period an
other unknown. Jim Shroyer, a
JV from last year, teamed with
Thurlow in a drive that covered
67 yards in nine plays. Key play
in the march was a 31-yard Thur
low-Shroyer pass which moved the
ball to the alumni 32. Seven plays
later the same combo connected
again, this time from three yards
out for the sixth Stanford tally.
FIRST • STRING quarterback
Sears twisted an ankle late in the
second quarter and was forced to
sit out the remainder of the game.
The injury was not serious and it
enabled Coach Jack Curtice to get
a look at all his quarterback candi
dates. Six signal callers got a
chance although returning letter
man Gary Sargeant played only
on defense.

Aside from Thurlow and Sears,
Chuck Butler, Bob Price, and Reg
Rhodes made appearances, and all
three got into the scoring act.
Butler, who replaced Sears after
he turned his ankle, cracked over
from two yards out near the end
of the second quarter. Getting in
for the last two series, Price
sneaked over from inches out
after Royse had intercepted his
second alumni pass and returned
it 53 yards. Rhodes then came off

the bench and carried over for the
two-point conversion.
Sears led the quarterback con
tingent in passing, completing
four of five for 42 yards. Butler
led in yardage with 55 but com
pleted just four of nine attempts.
THE VARSITY defense picked
off five alumni aerials and added
one touchdown on Steve Pursell’s
23-yard romp with the third stray
pass by Gustafson.
Norman, who seemingly has a
clear shot at the quarterback spot
for the Chicago Bears of the Na
tional Football League, was on
the mark as he passed to John
Bond for one touchdown and set
up the other with a 39-yard pitch
to Bossey.

THE ALUMNI was unable to
muster an effective rushing at
tack against the Cardinal defense
and picked up only 13 yards in
the first half and 44 overall. Mac
Wylie and Rich McMillan led in
that department with 29 and 26
yards respectively, both on four
carries.

For Coach Jack Curtice it was
his first win since November 14,
1959, when fullback Skip Face
scored 27 poins to spatrk the In
dians to a 39-22 victory over Ore
gon State in Corvallis.

Showing surprising punch on
the ground, the Stanford varsity
claimed its first victory over the
alumni in thi'ee years Saturday as
they rolled up a 47-14 score.
The Indians dominated the
game in every department except
passing where Dick Norman re
turned to haunt them. The former
Card and the nation’s leading
passer in 1959 threw for 167 yards
and one of the two alumni touch
downs.
THE VARSITY running game,
never more than a secondary wea
pon before, blossomed into its
own, racking up 302 yards and ac
counting for five of the seven
scores. Leading rusher for the
Cards was Danny Spence who
picked up 64 yards in just three
tries for a phenomenal 20.67 yard
average. The sophomore speed
ster stunned the alumni defense
as he took a pitchout from quar
terback Rod Sears and weaved his
49 yards to the alum 18 before
finally being overtaken by John
Bessey on the second play of the
game.
The Indians capitalized on the
scoring opportunity five plays
later as fullback Hal Steuber
drove over from two yards out
after Sears had hit right half
Larry Royse with a bullet on the
one.
Spence, who also caught two
passes for 17 yards, was denied
his chance to get into the scoring
column when an off-side penalty
nullified his two-yard touchdown
jaunt late in the second quarter.
FRESHMAN quarterback Steve
Thurlow, showing surprising
poise in his first varsity game, en
gineered three scoring drives and
gained 51 yards on the ground in
four carries. Early in the second

quarter Thurlow, mixing his
plays well, pitched out to Royse
who swept around the right side,
eluded several alumni tacklers,
and dashed 34 yards for paydirt.
The run capped a 51-yard drive
which took seven plays.

Moments after the second half
kick-off, Royse picked off a stray
Jerry Gustafson pass and fought
his way hack for 10 yards to set
up the next score. Thurlow then
dropped back to pass, but finding
nobody in the open elected to run.
The fleet freshman started around
right end, cut inside and drove for

Showing surprising punch on
the ground, the Stanford varsity
claimed its first victory over the
alumni in thi'ee years Saturday as
they rolled up a 47-14 score.
The Indians dominated the
game in every department except
passing where Dick Norman re
turned to haunt them. The former
Card and the nation’s leading
passer in 1959 threw for 167 yards
and one of the two alumni touch
downs.
THE VARSITY running game,
never more than a secondary wea
pon before, blossomed into its
own, racking up 302 yards and ac
counting for five of the seven
scores. Leading rusher for the
Cards was Danny Spence who
picked up 64 yards in just three
tries for a phenomenal 20.67 yard
average. The sophomore speed
ster stunned the alumni defense
as he took a pitchout from quar
terback Rod Sears and weaved his
49 yards to the alum 18 before
finally being overtaken by John
Bessey on the second play of the
game.
The Indians capitalized on the
scoring opportunity five plays
later as fullback Hal Steuber
drove over from two yards out
after Sears had hit right half
Larry Royse with a bullet on the
one.
Spence, who also caught two
passes for 17 yards, was denied
his chance to get into the scoring
column when an off-side penalty
nullified his two-yard touchdown
jaunt late in the second quarter.
FRESHMAN quarterback Steve
Thurlow, showing surprising
poise in his first varsity game, en
gineered three scoring drives and
gained 51 yards on the ground in
four carries. Early in the second

quarter Thurlow, mixing his
plays well, pitched out to Royse
who swept around the right side,
eluded several alumni tacklers,
and dashed 34 yards for paydirt.
The run capped a 51-yard drive
which took seven plays.

Moments after the second half
kick-off, Royse picked off a stray
Jerry Gustafson pass and fought
his way hack for 10 yards to set
up the next score. Thurlow then
dropped back to pass, but finding
nobody in the open elected to run.
The fleet freshman started around
right end, cut inside and drove for
37 yards to the alumni 17. Gary
Craig then skirted right end for
the score.

Early in the final period an
other unknown. Jim Shroyer, a
JV from last year, teamed with
Thurlow in a drive that covered
67 yards in nine plays. Key play
in the march was a 31-yard Thur
low-Shroyer pass which moved the
ball to the alumni 32. Seven plays
later the same combo connected
again, this time from three yards
out for the sixth Stanford tally.
FIRST • STRING quarterback
Sears twisted an ankle late in the
second quarter and was forced to
sit out the remainder of the game.
The injury was not serious and it
enabled Coach Jack Curtice to get
a look at all his quarterback candi
dates. Six signal callers got a
chance although returning letter
man Gary Sargeant played only
on defense.

Aside from Thurlow and Sears,
Chuck Butler, Bob Price, and Reg
Rhodes made appearances, and all
three got into the scoring act.
Butler, who replaced Sears after
he turned his ankle, cracked over
from two yards out near the end
of the second quarter. Getting in
for the last two series, Price
sneaked over from inches out
after Royse had intercepted his
second alumni pass and returned
it 53 yards. Rhodes then came off

the bench and carried over for the
two-point conversion.
Sears led the quarterback con
tingent in passing, completing
four of five for 42 yards. Butler
led in yardage with 55 but com
pleted just four of nine attempts.
THE VARSITY defense picked
off five alumni aerials and added
one touchdown on Steve Pursell’s
23-yard romp with the third stray
pass by Gustafson.
Norman, who seemingly has a
clear shot at the quarterback spot
for the Chicago Bears of the Na
tional Football League, was on
the mark as he passed to John
Bond for one touchdown and set
up the other with a 39-yard pitch
to Bossey.

THE ALUMNI was unable to
muster an effective rushing at
tack against the Cardinal defense
and picked up only 13 yards in
the first half and 44 overall. Mac
Wylie and Rich McMillan led in
that department with 29 and 26
yards respectively, both on four
carries.
