Stanford’s varsity eight row’ed
to a close fourth behind Washing
ton, Cal and the University of
British Columbia at the West
Coast Sprints Regatta Saturday.
Washington and Cal, current
power's in western rowing, stroked
dead even down the length of the
2,000 meter course until Washing

mile at a 41, pulled two feet ahead
to win.
The winning time was 6:32.3,
with Cal just .2 seconds behind.
The ÜBC shell finished IV»
lengths in back of the winning
boats, with Stanford only 2Vz
lengths behind the leaders. Long
Beach Slate, UCLA and Oregon
State were the last three boats.
Stanford, stx-oking a full four

strokes under Washington for
most of the race at a 32, sprinted
the last portion at a 37, but was
unable to close the lead boats’
margin. The Indians had lost only
to Washington and Cal before Sat
urday.
A fresh breeze, almost bow on
to the light racing shells, gave a
slight advantage to the heavier
crews. Washington, Cal and ÜBC,
in that order.
Cal took the Jayvee title with a
time of 6:39.7, and the strong
Washington frosh ran away with
their event, finishing seven
lengths ahead of Oregon State.
