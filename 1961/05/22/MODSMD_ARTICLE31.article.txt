# 'Vagabond' Presents Student Guide For European, Asian, African Travel
## 
### 
The Vagabond, a guide for stu
dent travellers published under
the auspices of the Stanford Over
seas Information Service, will be
on sale at Engineering Corner to
day and tomorrow. May 22 and 23.
from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The
price will be 30 cents per copy.
For the last several years, SO
IS has published annually a mim
eographed booklet of travel tips
on student travel in Europe. The
Vagabond is hoped to be a great
improvement over this in that it
is a pr ofessionally printed, perma
nent 56-page booklet with sections
not only on Europe but on Africa
and Asia as well.
Those students planning travel
in the near future to Europe or
the Iron Curtain countries of
Eastern Europe will find exten
sive selections on these countries
written by Stanford students who

have either lived or travelled in
them.
The practicability of all means
of inexpensive student travel,
' from hitchhiking to bicycling or
motor-cycling to riding tramp
steamers is discussed, along with
price quotations and availability
of such modes of travel.
Youth hostels, student hostels,
pensions and other- places where
students can get inexpensive lodg
ing and numerous contacts with
the peoples of foreign lands are
described and located
Also included are various and
j sundry suggestions for things to
do and places to see which have
been discovered and enjoyed by
previous student travellers.

The article on African and As
ian travel, written by a Stanford
student, George Corfino, who
spent last year hitchhiking exten
sively on those continents, is pre
sented somewhat differently. Be
cause American student travel is
very sparse in most African and
Asian countries, and because such
travel is seen to be very useful
both to students and to interna
tional relations, this section of the
Vagabond should serve “as evi
dence that such travel is feasible,
both economically and physically."
General Information is given on
health, obtaining visas, getting
oriented in strange places, making
contacts with people, etc., fol
lowed by sections on 14 specific
countries giving locations and
prices of transportation, lodging
and food.

With this booklet as a founda
tion, and “some initiative and im
agination” it is suggested that “a
year’s trip around the world can
be had for a student’s summer
wages.”

The Vagabond proposes to be “a
supplement to a guide book and
not a roplaeement of them.” For
this reason, anything' which is
readily available from other
sources is not printed, and infor
mation which is included is meant
expressly for students, on the as
sumption that student travellers
should be interested in inexpen
sive travel and extensive contacts
with people.
