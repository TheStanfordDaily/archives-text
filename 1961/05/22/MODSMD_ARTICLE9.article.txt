## 
### MIRIAM PETENSKY 
To provide a meeting place for
conservatives on campus was the
motivation for the formation of
the Young Americans for Free
dom in late February, stated
president Bob Turk.
The organization, which held
its first meetings this quarter,
is not a political action society,
but rather attempts to provide
discussions and speakers for
themselves as interested conserv
atives.
TI RK founded the group be
cause he felt the need for a con
servatively oriented political
group to counter current leftist
feeling. There is a revival in con
servative feeling. Turk states,
which is shown by reception of

I such men as Buckley and Gold
[ water.
The YAF group's constitution,
drawn up in late February, states
that “in this time of moral and
political crisis it is the responsi
bility of the youth of America
to affirm certain eternal truths.”
The group, which is composed
of roughly 40 interested people,
i feels political freedom cannot lie
| separated from economic free
j dom. The free play of supply and
demand is necessary and govern,-
j ment should not interfere with
jthe market economy, said Tom
j Reilly, who is interested in the
j YAF. Above all. national sover
eignty is important and'free citi
zens should defend their rights,
j THE STANKOKII group is not

affiliated with the Political Union,
which works actively to find
speakers for the public, and it is
not affiliated with the national
YAF. The national organization,
composed of college students, has
the same purposes as the Stan
ford YAF but carries on political
action, such as lobbying, sending
letters and picketing.
Two meetings have been held
this quarter and a third is sched
uled for this Thursday. Officers
will lie elected and the statement
of principles of another conserv
ative group will be discussed.
Turk welcomes all interested
people to come to tilH at 7:30
p.m. for the meeting.
