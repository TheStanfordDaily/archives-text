DR. FROOO'S THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: 111 College, it

Dear Dr. Frood: I have a confession.
All my life I have been trying to
learn how to whistle. I just can t.
Please, will you tell me how to
whistle?
Puckered
DEAR PUCKERED: Watch the birds.
Notice how they gather a pocket of
air deep within the breast, then
push thin jets of this air into the
throat, through the larynx, up and
around the curled tongue, and then
bounce the air from the roof of the
mouth out through the teeth (which
act like the keyboard on a piano).
Practice this. In no time your
friends will be amazed at the beau
tiful, warbly trills that flow from
your beak.

Dear Dr. Frood: I just can't seem to
get in step with the rest of the students
here. They enjoy parties, dancing, folk
singing and dating. None of these
things interest me at all. Am 1 behind
the times or what?
Left Out
DEAR LEFT: You’re in the right times;
you’re just one of our squares.

Dear Dr. Frood: What do you think ac
counts for the fact that college stu
dents smoke more Luckies than any
other regular?
Marketing Student
DEAR MS: Collegiate Lucky smokers.
Dear Dr. Frood: Hamlet killed Polo
nius. Macbeth stabbed Duncan.
Richard murdered his little neph
ews. Othello strangled Desdemona,
and Titus served Tamora her two
sons in a pie before killing her. Don't
you think this obsession with vio
lence would make an excellent sub
ject for a term paper?
English Major
DEAR ENGLISH: No, I don’t, and my
advice to you is to stop running
around with that crowd.
Dear Dr. Frood: My coach is writing this letter
for me because I am illiterate. We want to
know if I got to learn how to read to get into
college. I am the best football player in the
state. X
DEAR X; Every college today will insist that
you meet certain basic entrance requirements.
I’m afraid you’re just out of luck, X, unless
you learn how to read diagrams and count to
eleven.
ARE YOU READY FOR THE FLOOD? Most students today live a carefree, devil-may-care
existence—buying their Luckies day to day. Only a handful have had the good sense to set
aside an emergency cache of three or four Lucky cartons, wrapped in oilskin. When the dam
breaks—they'll be ready. Will you?
