# COMMUNICATIONS EXPERT:
## JFK's Religion Changed Election 
### 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Following' is a summary of a talk on “Tin*
1960 Elections” given by Dr. Chilton 11. Bush, head of the Depart
ment of Communication and Journalism, at last week-end’s Alumni
Conference.)
Religion was the factor that made the 1960 presidential election
most different from all previous elections.
Because of his religion, Kennedy gained'more votes in the large
states than lie lost in certain other states. For the whole country,
the Protestant voting pattern was the same as it was in 1956, but
in some areas contributed to the Republican gains.
These Inferences are based on the data of opinion pollsters and
analyses of the votes in strategic precincts.
THE ANTI-COMMUNIST attitude of the Catholic church was an
advantage to Kennedy among Pollsh-Americans, many of whom had
distrusted Democratic foreign policy in 1952 and 1956.
Being a Catholic was also an advantage to Kennedy in the areas
of high unemployment in the larger states. This was because the
“prosperity” appeal was not a cross-pressure for Catholics to vote
Republican as it might have been if the election had been held a few'
months earlier when employment was high.
Election returns in some suburbs with a high Catholic population
also indicated an increase of Democratic voters. Now that it has
been demonstrated (hat a Catholic can be elected president, some of
these upper income voters may not be influenced by the religious
issue in the future.
JEWS, WHO CONSTITUTE about 3 per cent of the voting popu
lation but are concentrated in a few large cities, voted overwhelm
ingly for Kennedy 81 per cent in the Gallup post-election study.
This compares with 75 per cent in 1956.
The Negro vote also helped Kennedy both in the North and
in the South. About 4 out of 10 Negroes voted for Eisenhower in
1956, inil in 1960 only about one-third of the Negroes voted for Nixon.
Members of labor unions also voted more Democratic in 1960
about 65 per cent as compared with 57 per cent in 1956.
THE FARM VOTE in 1960 was little changed from the vote in
1956.
The proportion of young voters who were for a Democratic candi
date increased in 1960. The Republican candidates had been attracting

more young voters since 1948.
THERE IS SOME evidence that retired people with low incomes
favored Nixon because they feared Democratic policies would cause
inflation of prices.
The women’s vote in 1960 was split evenly between the two candi
dates. About three out of five women had voted Republican in 1952
and 1956. Kennedy received 10 per cent more of the women’s vote
than Stevenson did in 1956, and many of these votes were of young
women.
Kennedy carried only nine states by more than 51 per cent of the
popular vote, and four of these were northeastern states which re
flected bloc voting.
THIS FACT has revived interest in some of the proposals for
changing the electoral system. Six different joint resolutions are
pending in the Senate. The one that has attracted the most support
from Republican leaders and southern senators is the Mundt reso
lution.
This proposal provides that the voter would vote for two electors
at large in his state and for one elector from his elector-district.
Under this system, the electoral vote in some states would be divided
among the candidates instead of all of the electoral votes going to
the candidate who had a popular majority in the state.
As a result of the election, conservative Republican leaders are
advocating a type of campaign in future elections in which the appeal
will be to individuals rather than to voters as members of groups.
Senator Goldwater, for example, would try to detach some labor
union members from their group allegiance by appealing to their
interest as individuals.
THE CONSERVATIVE party in Great Britain has had success
with that type of campaign since 1945.
The liberal wing of the Republican party, however, may wish to
compete for the votes of blocs as the Democrats have done since 1936.
This struggle between strategies is now going on. In the minds
of many voters it will be confused with the candidacies of Rockefeller,
Goldwater and Nixon.
It isn't possible now to predict which strategy would be better
for Republicans, Both strategies seem to succeed in certain senatorial
and congressional races.
