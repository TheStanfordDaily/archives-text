### 
MONTGOMERY, AIa.—UPI—FBI agents arrested four men yes
terday accused of burning a bus carrying white and negro "freedom
riders" into Alabama, and the Justice Department rushed 200 more
U.S. Marshals to the state's riot-torn capital.
Steel-helmeted state National Guardsmen with loaded rifles and

fixed bayonets patrolled Mont
gomery on order from Gov. John
Patterson who insisted that fed
eral agents should get out of Ala
bama.
The white-columned city on the
Alabama River, known as the
“Cradle of the Confederacy,” was
intensely quiet after a savage
night. Most of the marshals who
battled a surging white mob last
night were pulled back to Max
well Air Force Base near Mont
gomery to rest and await develop
ments.
U.S. ASST. ATTY. GEN. Byron
(Whizzer) White, head of the
force of 500-550 marshals, said
“Our present intentions are to re
main here a few days ... (in the
event of) any disturbances not
only here but in other places in
Alabama.”
White told a news conference at
Maxwell AFB that the marshals
would act in concert with National
Guardsmen to preserve order. He
said federal officials had exam
ined the conditions under which
Army troops might be needed and
“conditions here don’t appear” to
warrant them.
He said ho felt the National
Guard had the “capability to pro
tect federal rights.” But he added,
“if there is a major concentration,
we will bo ready.”
WHITE SAID if marshals had
not been on hand during Sunday
night’s mob action “there wmuld
have been very serious conse
quences.”

One marshal, William D. Behen
of Jacksonville, Fla., said ho de
tected no sign of organized lead
ership in the mob which he said
seemed made up of youths. He
said “individuals” egged the
youths on.
At Anniston, Ala., 100 miles to
the northeast, FBI agents ar
rested four men yesterday and
charged them with attacking and
burning a bus carrying the first
“freedom riders” into Alabama
May 14. The attack began a week
of racial tension and violence that
erupted into street battles Sunday
night.
THE MEN were jailed in lieu
of $5,000 bond. They were identi
fied as Robert D. Couch, 19, unem
ployed; Jerry Eason, 22, a flower
shop employee; Frank B. Johnson.
43, a maintenance man, and Dal
ford L. Roberts, 42, a cab driver,
all of Anniston.

MONTGOMERY, AIa.—UPI—FBI agents arrested four men yes
terday accused of burning a bus carrying white and negro "freedom
riders" into Alabama, and the Justice Department rushed 200 more
U.S. Marshals to the state's riot-torn capital.
Steel-helmeted state National Guardsmen with loaded rifles and

fixed bayonets patrolled Mont
gomery on order from Gov. John
Patterson who insisted that fed
eral agents should get out of Ala
bama.
The white-columned city on the
Alabama River, known as the
“Cradle of the Confederacy,” was
intensely quiet after a savage
night. Most of the marshals who
battled a surging white mob last
night were pulled back to Max
well Air Force Base near Mont
gomery to rest and await develop
ments.

(Whizzer) White, head of the
force of 500-550 marshals, said

only here but in other places in
Alabama.”
