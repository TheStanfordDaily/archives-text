# Krushchev, JFK Make Summit Date
## 
### 
The news that President Kennedy will meet face-to-face with
Premier Khrushchev early this June in Vienna has again stirred an
optimism among some of us who seek a lessening of international
tension. This is unfortunate.
Only a year ago Mr. Khrushchev aborted the Paris summit con
ference with his demand for a public apology from President Eisen
hower over the U-2 incident. Since that occasion, he has put on an
other one of his show-stopping performances at the United Nations
as he embraced Mr. Castro and banged his shoe on the table. The
east-west conflict has not eased since last May. It has worsened.
Despite these defeats in Cuba, Laos and Geneva the President
still wants to talk to the Chairman so that the latter will not miscal
culate the toughness and determination of the new Administration.
The President has also expressed a wish to have an informal ex
change of views on world problems.
In spite of the apparent weakness of the United States position in
Cuba and Laos, our actual defense capabilities have not changed in
favor of the Soviet Union. While the Soviet premier will be im
pressed by the Kennedy vigor, it is highly unlikely that this impres
sion will change his evaluation of United States military strength.
There is the danger, too, that summit talks will give rise to the
wishful thinking among the peoples of the world that this type of
diplomacy in itself can ease world tensions. Two world leaders can
not necessarily solve problems of immense complexity within a few
hours of conversation. Mr. Khrushchev, in fact, has shown a tendency
to turn these international discussions into his propaganda forums.
Since his ascension to power, he has done practically nothing to
indicate that he wishes to ease international tensions. We can more
likely expect tirades on Cuba, than any concessions from him at this
upcoming meeting.

The President during the remaining years of his term will hope
fully be more judicious in both the number and timing of his summit
conferences, for summitry is usually unprofitable diplomacy. Sum
mits take the President away from Washington where he is at the
hub of both domestic and foreign policy decision-making. They sub
ject him to nervous strain and they downgrade the authority of diplo
mats already stationed in the various countries.

As Walter Lippmann has said, "personal summitry cannot suc
ceed unless in the interval between the big meetings there is per
sistent and imaginative quiet diplomacy." There has been little of
this diplomacy in these first months of the Kennedy administration.
