Batista Regime

I wish to express regret that
the United States gave recogni
tion to the Batista regime in Cuba,
and that we were slow to support
the revolution, lead by Fidel Cas
tro against that dictator. We are
a nation born of revolution. Our
belief in freedom and the worth of
the individual morally obligates
us to oppose any kind of tyranny.
The existence of the right of
the minority to disagree and the
right of the majority to rule only
as long as they are the majority
is the difference between freedom
and totalitarianism.

Castro must now be opposed on
the same grounds as those that
should have been used against
Batista. Where are the promised
free elections? Where are many
of the early leaders of the revo
lution? Where are those who dis
agree with Castro? Could it be
that our indirect support of the
Cuban exiles was laudable but in
adequate rather than a “loss of
honor?”

We are now engaged in a battle
for survival—cultural survival.
Our values, our right to disagree,
our freedom is being attacked.
The stated purpose of the Soviet
conspiracy is to make the World
Communistic. The present Castro
government has become a part of
that conspiracy which has en
slaved over one-third of the
Earth’s people. Free elections
have never been the route to Com
munist domination. Cuba is in ef
fect a colony of the imperialistic
Soviet Union which makes even
less attempt to hide its ultimate
aims than did Nazi Germany.
Revolution is the only answer
to tyranny which makes no other
provision for the will of the
people. Let us put an end to mo
ral weaknes by actively opposing
totalitarian governments whether
they be in Cuba, Spain, Yugosla
via, Hungary, or South Africa.

No Exercise
Mr. Buckley’s diction was su
perb. His lucidity and his humor
captivated his audience. By w r ay
of contrast the members of the
panel were in general unclear and
seemed unsure whether to defend
what Mr. Buckley attacked, e.g.,
liberalism, or to attack what he
defended, e.g., preventative mili
tarism and conservatism. The
emotional commitment of the
members of the panel to their
position tended to destroy their
ability to suggest weaknesses in
the structure of Mr. Buckley’s
logic. If the question Professor
North asked last (concerning spe
cific methods of using preventa
tive military force) had been
asked first, then the apparent
solidity of Mr. Buckley’s position
might have been more severely
challenged. Certainly the actual
successful use of military force
in Laos does not seem a trivially
simple matter.
Why did the members of the
panel seem unable to cope with
Mr. Buckley? The liberal struc
ture is sounder than it appeared.
Perhaps their homework had not
been carefully done, as Mr. Buck
ley somewhat unkindly observed.
Perhaps they were not aware of
the intellectual calibre of their
antagonist. But most of all it ap
peared that they suffered from
a lack of violent mental exercise
and that their verbal agility had
suffered. Perhaps their ideas
have not been sufficiently chal
lenged by their colleagues or by
their students.
It certainly would seem reason
able to propose the staging of
more frequent faculty vs. faculty
and perhaps faculty vs. student
debates, and also the placing of
greater emphasis on rhetoric and
logic for the students. Hopefully,
this would serve to increase the
dexterity and subtlety of thought
and the lucidity of speech, of the
university community as a whole.
