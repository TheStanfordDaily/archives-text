# FIRST OF A SERIES
## Stanford Religiosity: A Great Cosmic Administration Utility? 
### KEEM STASSEN 
Dr. Will Herberg, a dynamic
theologian and a perceptive soci
ologist from Drew University,
spoke of two kinds of religious
interest in the United Slates when
he was at Stanford last month.

I The first, the
religion of “be
longing and to
getherness,” ac
! cording to Her
tberg, overvalues
friendliness and
conformity and
fears insecurity
and loneliness.
THIS American
value system
leads to the

church which is all fellowship and
no thought, all coffee hour and
no worship. The archtype is The
American suburban community
church, which has no special be
liefs but has very popular bazaars.
Herberg terms the second,
“spiritual radicalism.” It is the
religion of those “passionately
concerned with the ultimate.”
These people believe in a God who
is living in their everyday life.
For them God is no more present
in church than he is anywhere
else. He may even be less present
there.
After explaining these two
kinds of believers, Herberg de
clared "Both kinds are well rep
resented at Stanford.”
THIS LEADS to the question—
What is religion at Stanford?
When is it the religion of belong
ing and when is it the religion of
dedicated faith?

This question becomes more
specific when it is directed at Me
morial Church. Herberg spoke of
the religion of suburbia. Is there
a comparable religion of “aca
demia” at Stanford?

Herberg said “American religl
ousity has made God into a great
cosmic public utility.” Could it
be said that “Stanford religiosity
has made God into a great cosmic
administration utility?”
OR IS THE opposite true? Is
Memorial Church today a center
for religious thought and worship
for everyone?
Similar questions can be asked
of the religion classes at Stanford.
Do students study religion so that
they will learn a cocktail party
philosophy, so they can transmit
objective notes to an objective
final and complete the course
with two academic units of A?

Or is religion studied at Stan
ford because students want to find
out what faith is and how it
works, because they care about
this concept which is called, for
want of a better term, God?
WHAT ABOUT the various de
nominational church groups con
nected with Stanford? Do they
compete by means of social gath

(“rings and attractive advertising
in order to get students away
from studying, or away from
other church groups?
Or do they offer discussion and
fellowship with other Stanford
students who are interested in
the same problem—that is, what
difference does God make to us?
The Stanford movement toward
ecumenicalism presents another
aspect of the same problem. Is
this a sign that denominations
have finally begun to realize that
they have more in common than
in conflict?
Or is the ecumenical movement
an example of the identity com
plex taken to the extreme? Is this
one way of saying “It doesn’t
matter what we believe—what
matters is that we are nice to each
othei’.”
We wonder. We criticize. We
praise. The next three articles in
this series will be an attempt to
provide facts and opinions to help
answer some of these questions.
These articles are written to help
each person to begin to re-evalu
ate religion at Stanford, and then
throw it out, change it. or cling
to it accordingly.
