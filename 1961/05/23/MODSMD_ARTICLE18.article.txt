(Continued from page 1)
last night when a mob stormed a
downtown Negro church where
1,500 Negroes, including 18 “free
dom riders.” gathered to plan new
attacks on Alabama segregation
laws.
The woman egged the attackers
on, and the federal marshals were
forced back. It was then that Pat
terson declared a limited martial
law and called out 800 National
Guardsmen.
PATTERSON, backed by state
officials and Alabama congress
men and supported by many other
southern governors, insisted fed
eral intervention i« unnecessary
and unwelcome. Alabama high
way patrolmen stopped all inter
state buses entering Alabama and
read occupants a state injunction
against “freedom riders.”
