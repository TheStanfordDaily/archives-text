# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION

### Ken Dery 
An opinion was expressed editorially yesterday that the Stanford
Buck Club’s grants-in-aid to athletes are "an unfortunate misdirection
of money.” This writer believes to the contrary.
The issue here is not whether the Buck Club or any other alumni
group has the right to establish such a grant-in-aid program, hut
rather are the basic criteria for awarding the grants in keeping with
the "standard of values that a great University must serve.”
NO ONE will disagree with the statement that an institution of
education such as Stanford places academic learning first. But there
is more to education than just classroom knowledge. The concept
of the well-rounded person is a realistic one and not just an ideal
which rationalizes lack of skill in any one particular field in favor
of mediocrity in a variety of areas. Who, then, is to deny that
athletics, big-time athletics in particular, do not add to the develop
ment and growth of an individual at an institution such as ours?
There are many rewards to he gained from competition in ath
letics on the big-time intercollegiate level which cannot be gained
through a de-emphasized program. Many of our top citizens w'ere
athletes in college and their desire, will-to-win and ability to function
as a team have helped to mold them into the strong leaders which
they have become. Athletes competing in intercollegiate competition
gain a sense of teamwork and personal fortitude'which is symbolic
of America herself.
WHO CAN say that the Buck Club “instead . . . should make a
significant contribution to higher education?” The cases of men
who have gone on to become professional athletes, physical educa
tor’s or coaches are only part of the story. To others, athletics have
served as a means to an education in highly diversified areas. To
quote an article written by Stanford Track Coach Payton Jordan in
Mentor magazine, “It seems inequitable that while colleges and uni
versities stress the development of professional men in every other
walk of life through scholarships, awards, and endowments, these
same colleges should be frowned upon for giving compar able assist
ance to athletes.”

Top Athletes Have Been Top Students

If it is true that “outstanding athletes are often outstanding stu
dents” as the editorial says tin the last seven years at Stanford
there have been 33 lettermen in basketball. Of these, 21 maintained
the necessary grades and continued on to graduate school.), why
should the Buck Club redefine the criterion for its awards? If a
man can gain the experience of playing in major intercollegiate
athletics and still achieve outstanding academic marks, then it seems
that the man would probably be a more highly developed person.
De-emphasis of sports at Stanford would not give the participating
athletics the same feeling. Much like intramurals these de-empha
sized sports would function under a “give-a-damn” attitude which
benefits neither the participants nor the spectators to much extent.
THE GREAT debate which has increased in fervor around the
Stanford campus in the last few years is whether there is any
benefit gained by granting aid to a needy athlete versus granting
aid to say a needy student studying dramatics. When the editorial
states that the Buck Club “should ignore the athletes who are not
outstanding students” it forgets that anyone accepted for admission
at this institution is recognized as an outstanding student. In saying
that the recipients of the grants need only maintain a C average, the
author failed to state that recipients of grants-in-aid in other fields
dramatics, debating, music and others—need only maintain the same
C average.

In conclusion let me slate that I believe lliat there is a deep, rich
feeling which players on a team can instill to a spectator—a feeling
which can give the spectator a keen thrill. Rand members, pompon
girls and just plain rooters can feel what is taking place on the
athletic field, and they receive a type of participation which can he
j'oth important and meaningful. Those who have never seen an
important basketball game go into overtime; those who have never
felt the pangi of anxiety before file start of the last track event of
the day, the mile relay, when the race will decide the afternoon’s
winner, have missed something.
