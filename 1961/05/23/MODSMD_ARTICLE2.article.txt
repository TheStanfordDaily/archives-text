# Paint, Feathers on Fiji; Pledge Joke?
## 
### 
Stanford junior Don Peterson was kidnapped from his off-campus
apartment early Sunday morning and carried by automobile to a
montain park near Gilroy where he was smeared with molasses,
dusted with feathers painted green and released to find his way
home alone.
Peterson, a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, was appar-

ently the victim of a Fiji pledge
sneak prank, said Stanford Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis. The In-

ferfraternity Council Judicial
Council is investigating the case
in cooperation with Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler.
THE PERSONS responsible for
the assault on Peterson have not
yet been determined. IFC Presi
dent Swede Pierson told the Daily
last night after a meeting involv
ing himself, Winbigler, Asst. Dean
of Men David Larimer and Peter
son.

Pierson an d Winbiglcr each
said the Fijis are cooperating
fully with the IFC and the Univer
sity on the matter. Pierson said
Peterson was uninjured, and had
a doctorâ€™s statement that his phys
ical condition was good.
Peterson was returning to his
Palo Alto apartment from a date
Sunday at 1:30 a.m. when several
figures jumped him, pulled a pil
lowcase over his head and forced
him into a waiting car.

WHEN THE destination, Mt.
Madonna Park in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, was reached, he was
shoved from the car and stripped
to his skivvies.
Molasses was smeared every
where but his eyes, mouth and
nose. The contents of two feather
pillows were then dusted over him
and green paint applied. His
hands were tied behind his back
with a web belt.
His abductors released him and
sped away. After walking two
miles, Peterson arrived at a main
highway. The third car to pass
stopped, and after examining Pe
terson in his headlights, the driver
promised to tell Gilroy police, and
roared away.
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies found Peterson at 3 a.m.
in a telephone booth and took him
to Wheeler Hospital in Gilroy to
be cleaned up.
