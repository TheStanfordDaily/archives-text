# Tribe Closes Season At Berkeley Today
## 
### 
Firmly entrenched in fourth
place in the CIBA standings, the
Card baseball team close's out its
season today against the Califor
nia Bears at Berkeley. A Stanford
loss would move cellar-dwelling
Santa Clara into a tie for fourth
with the Indians.
Cal, having posted a 10-5 record
to date will finish in second place
regardless of the outcome this
afternoon.

close out three years af varsity
ball when he starts against the
rival Bears. The stocky left
hander has been erratic this sea
son, but has been a valuable man
for Coach Dutch Fehring over the
three-year period. Perhaps his
biggest moment came as a junior
when he beat Santa Clara in both

games of a doubleheader, tying
the CIBA record for consecutive
innings pitched and breaking the
Stanford mark.
Fehring will go with his usual
lineup of Bob Overman, catcher;
Lee Moench, first base; Mike Ma
gee, second; Joel Shulman, short
stop; Rich Ferra/zano. third;
John Hurlbut, left field; Hal
Schut/mann, center; and Skip
Lawrence, right.
Moench, Magee, Hurlbut, and
Schutz.mann will also be making
their last appearance in varsity
togs. Other seniors on the squad
include Jim Cowart. Mike Felice,
Terry Lindeman and Earl Russell.
The Indians will be out to even
the ’6l series with California
which now stands at 2-1 for the
Bears.
