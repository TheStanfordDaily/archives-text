# Tractors for POW's Deal Abrew With Cuba
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD —A com
miltee of prominent Americans
today promised 10 Cuban war
prisoners to raise money for 500
tractors demanded by Fidel Cas
tro as the price for releasing more
than 1,200 prisoners.
The pledge was reported by
Walter Reuther, president of the
United Automobile Workers, after
a conference with the 10 paroled
Cubans. Castro let the prisoners
come to this country to negotiate
for the tractors.

The group met for about an
hour with the “Tractors for Free
dom Committee.” Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt is honorary chairman

of the committee. Reuther and
Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower, presi
dent of Johns Hopkins University,
are co-chairmen.
Reuther told a news conference
the 10 prisoners had been told by
Castro that the proposed deal was
not “trading tractors for people.”
They said he called it payment for
war damage caused during the ill
fated invasion of Cuba.

In Congress Sen. Homer E.
Capehart, R.-Ind., said the com
mittee would be violating federal
law unless President Kennedy has
given them authority to raise the
tractor funds. And if the Presi
dent has, Capehart told a news
conference, “It is an almost un
pardonable sin ... a most pathetic
situation.”

Capehart cited the Logan Act,
forbidding private negotiations

with foreign governments, to back
up his contention.
Reuther described the commit
tee as "voluntary, non-govern
ment but said the group had been
“authorized to say we are sanc
tioned.”

Reuther said costs of the heavy
type ranged up to $34,000 each
and that 500 tractors of that type
would cost about $l5 million.
Shortly before the prisoners ar
rived, Sen. Barry M. Goldwater,
R.-Ariz„ branded Castro’s offer
“Communist blackmail.” He said
U.S. prestige would nosedive if
Americans provided tractors for
“a Communist conspiracy only 90
miles off our shores.”

Sen. Wayne Morse, D.-Ore.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on Latin
America, finally proposed that the
State Department make clear im
mediately its position toward the
fund-raising drive.
In urging the State Department
to clarify its position, Morse said
he did not feel the committee was
violating the Logan Act. But he
said “We don’t know what chain
reaction they may be starting
with this proposal.”

America, finally proposed that the
State Department make clear im
mediately its position toward the
fund-raising drive.
In urging the State Department
to clarify its position, Morse said
he did not feel the committee was
violating the Logan Act. But he
said “We don’t know what chain
reaction they may be starting
with this proposal.”
WASHINGTON (UPD —A com
miltee of prominent Americans
today promised 10 Cuban war
prisoners to raise money for 500
tractors demanded by Fidel Cas
tro as the price for releasing more
than 1,200 prisoners.
The pledge was reported by
Walter Reuther, president of the
United Automobile Workers, after
a conference with the 10 paroled
Cubans. Castro let the prisoners
come to this country to negotiate
for the tractors.

The group met for about an
hour with the “Tractors for Free
dom Committee.” Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt is honorary chairman

of the committee. Reuther and
Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower, presi
dent of Johns Hopkins University,
are co-chairmen.
Reuther told a news conference
the 10 prisoners had been told by
Castro that the proposed deal was
not “trading tractors for people.”
They said he called it payment for
war damage caused during the ill
fated invasion of Cuba.

In Congress Sen. Homer E.
Capehart, R.-Ind., said the com
mittee would be violating federal
law unless President Kennedy has
given them authority to raise the
tractor funds. And if the Presi
dent has, Capehart told a news
conference, “It is an almost un
pardonable sin ... a most pathetic
situation.”

Capehart cited the Logan Act,
forbidding private negotiations

with foreign governments, to back
up his contention.
Reuther described the commit
tee as "voluntary, non-govern
ment but said the group had been
“authorized to say we are sanc
tioned.”

Reuther said costs of the heavy
type ranged up to $34,000 each
and that 500 tractors of that type
would cost about $l5 million.
Shortly before the prisoners ar
rived, Sen. Barry M. Goldwater,
R.-Ariz„ branded Castro’s offer
“Communist blackmail.” He said
U.S. prestige would nosedive if
Americans provided tractors for
“a Communist conspiracy only 90
miles off our shores.”

Sen. Wayne Morse, D.-Ore.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Subcommittee on Latin
America, finally proposed that the

mediately its position toward the
fund-raising drive.
