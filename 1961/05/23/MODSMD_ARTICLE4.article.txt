royal Laotian government ap
pealed Sunday to the Geneva
Conference to help carry out a
cease-fire after peace talks broke
down Sunday at the rebel held

cease-fire in Laos counted for
nothing.
THEY SAID efforts of the
three-nation International Control
Commission for Laos to investi
gate the most serious truce viola
tions were being thwarted by the
“neutralist” government at Xieng
Khouang.

14-nation meeting in Geneva ask
ing for a guarantee of Laos’ inde
pendence and neutrality and
speedy implementation of the
cease-fire by the control commis
