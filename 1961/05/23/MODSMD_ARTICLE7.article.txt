# South Korea Junta Continues Defiance
## 
### 
SEOUL, Korea (UPD The
chiefs of the Republic of Korea’s
armed forces swore allegiance
yesterday to the military junta
that seized power a week ago and
continued to defy United Nations
authortly.

The junta, which had promised
to restore civilian government as
soon as possible, dissolved all po
litical parties and labor unions in
moves that brought the nation
closer to military dictatorship.

MILITARY chiefs took a now
oath of office in a ceremony at the
National Assembly building, now
headquarters of the junta.
They continued to ignore orders
of United Nations Commander in
Chief, Gen. Carter B. Magruder of
the United Stales. Their actions
shocked Koreans and heightened
tensions in a nation alarmed by
mass arrests and drastic decrees
curbing civil liberties.
They further complicated rela

; tions with the United States
i which has opposed the junta from
the start.
THE military chiefs ignored or
ders by Magrauder to:
• Send back to their original
positions those units withdrawn
from the United Nations Com
mand to stage the May 16 coup.
Magruder contends the with
drawal was illegal.
• Restore to their original com
mands an estimated 15 front lino
generals now under arrest, or re
place them only with officers ac
ceptable to Magruder.
U.N. command authorities said
the junta has not complied with
either of these orders, although
some troop elements used in the
coup have returned to their orig
inal positions.
The military regime continued
its roundup of Communist sus
pects, hoodlums and other alleged
law violators.
