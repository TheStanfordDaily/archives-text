California Attorney General Stanley Mosk said last night that the
state will not act if Stanford administration meets its responsibilities
in punishing the Fiji pledges who abducted and tarred and feathered
active Don Peterson early Sunday morning.

“In the last case at Pasadena
City College, the administration
acted forthrightly and suspended
the individuals involved and in

were prosecuted and convicted in
the courts and there was nothing
left for the state to do.”
Asked if he would waive state
action if the administration takes
action, Mosk said, “Yes, if they
fulfill their responsibility, it will
satisfy us.”

Assistant Attorney General
Howard Jewel said that such
pledge pranks "definitely fall un
der the state law prohibiting haz
ing.”

THE LAW provides penalties of
from $5O to $5OO in fines or six
months in jail or both.
Meanwhile at Stanford, the case
was referred to IFC Judicial
Council for action. This body met
last night and adopted recommen
dations which will now be sub
mitted to the IFC board for ap
proval. These recommendations
will then go to the administration.
The names of the persons con
cerned along with their punish
ments will be announced after the
administration has acted on IFC
recommendations.
DEAN OF Students H. Donald
Winbigler indicated that a final
decision will bo forthcoming from
his office within two days.
Winbigler said that the speed
with which the University is act
ing is not a result of pressure
from the attorney general. “I
think it is to everyone’s advan
tage to act as fast as possible.
Our action could influence or
have a bearing on the state’s ac
tion, but I would not go so far
as to say that this was the con
trolling factor.”
The incident involved began
early Sunday morning when six
Fiji pledges kidnapped active Don
Peterson from his off-campus
apartment and took him by auto
mobile to a park near Gilroy
where he was stripped of his
clothes and smeared with mo
lasses and feathers and then re
leased to find his way home.
AFTER walking two miles, Pe
terson reached the main highway.
The third car to pass stopped and
promised to phone the police.
Peterson was then picked up
and taken to Wheeler Hospital in
Gilroy where it took attendants
more than an hour to remove the
sticky plumage from his body.
While Peterson was generally
silent about the incident, his girl
friend, who he had dropped off a
few minutes before ho was ab
ducted, commented. “These pledge
pranks have been going on for
months. The boys are always go
ing home to find their rooms have
been torn up.”

DEAN OF Students H. Donald
Winbigler indicated that a final
decision will bo forthcoming from
his office within two days.
Winbigler said that the speed
with which the University is act

from the attorney general. “I
think it is to everyone’s advan

Our action could influence or
have a bearing on the state’s ac

as to say that this was the con
trolling factor.”
The incident involved began
early Sunday morning when six
Fiji pledges kidnapped active Don
Peterson from his off-campus
apartment and took him by auto
mobile to a park near Gilroy
where he was stripped of his
clothes and smeared with mo
lasses and feathers and then re
leased to find his way home.
AFTER walking two miles, Pe
terson reached the main highway.
The third car to pass stopped and
promised to phone the police.
Peterson was then picked up
and taken to Wheeler Hospital in
Gilroy where it took attendants
more than an hour to remove the
sticky plumage from his body.
While Peterson was generally
silent about the incident, his girl
friend, who he had dropped off a
few minutes before ho was ab
ducted, commented. “These pledge
pranks have been going on for
months. The boys are always go
ing home to find their rooms have
been torn up.”
California Attorney General Stanley Mosk said last night that the
state will not act if Stanford administration meets its responsibilities
in punishing the Fiji pledges who abducted and tarred and feathered
active Don Peterson early Sunday morning.
