# HUMOR?
## Cal Pelican Censured 
### 
The Stanford Chaparral’s coun
terpart at Cal—The Pelican—was
censured Monday for some pun
gent comments on the military
and Cal President Clark Kerr.
The Student Publications
Board, after seeing the May issue
of the publication,
voted to censure The Pelican and
Editor Don Wegars. The censure
is a reprimand and does not carry
with it suspension of the maga
zine.
Only 11 days ago, the Chappie
was suspended for the year and
Editor Brad Efron sent home un
til autumn quarter for the May
issue, considered by many as too
racy and detrimental to the Uni
versity.
Following arc some comments
made about Kerr:
“THE MAN who looks like a
Scholar is President of the Uni
versity. He is a Liberal because
Time said so. He was Planning to
be Secretary of Labor but will
Probably be Governor instead. He
used to Tattle on the University
to (he Slate Committee on Com
munism and he Got his Just Re
wards. Ho knows Who pays the
Bills, little children.”
THAT PARAGRAPH and the
one on the military were in a part
of the magazine called “The Peli
can Primer,” a satire on standard
elementary school primers.
Here is what was said about
the military:
“They are Military Men be
cause they do Not like to Work.
In the Second World War, they
Distinguished themselves by rap
ing Old Women and Small Girls.
“IF' ANY OF' Them say Things
to Y r ou, little children, Knee them
in the Groin.”
The Publications Board saw
this and censured the magazine,
at the same time asking the stu
dent executive committee to fol
low suit.
It also recommended that:
• The Pelican, aided by a Pub
Board subcommittee, prepare by
laws on editorial policy and staff
appointments, something the
magazine hasn’t had previously.

• The ex-com and the faculty
take no disciplinary action
against either the magazine or the
editor.
