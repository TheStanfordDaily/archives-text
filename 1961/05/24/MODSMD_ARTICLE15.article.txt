Dean Winbigler’s action on
Chappie will have some refresh
ing consequences and some
alarming ones. On the bright side,
it explodes the myth (so recently
buttressed by the expulsion of the
ballot box stuffers) that a uni
versity shares in democratic prac
tices. It always should have been
obvious that a university, by vir
tue of its grading practices, its
hierarchies, and preferments, is
much rather an aristocracy, and
the Dean’s action, it is to be
hoped, will direct the brighter
students away from student legis
lature, and student judicial func
tions, where they so emptily play
God, and back to their studies
which are, after all, their only
reason for being here.
The matter of taste and pro
priety is, however, a serious one,
and if the Dean will set the Ad
ministration up as an "arbiter
elegantiae” all sorts of ambigui
ties are abou to arise. Only the
most limited Bible-belt mentality
could believe that matters of pru
rience or fundamentalism violat
ed are the greatest outrages, and
I should like to recommend a
series of candidates for expulsion
that no taste crusade could con
sider overlooking. First, the pro
ducers of last autumn’s "Gaie
ties,” which imposed grossly on
every intelligence beyond a cre
tin’s; then the editorial staff of
the newspaper whose manner of
reportage combines the highest
inaccuracy with the greatest irrel
evance and whose editorials are
so poorly written and so uninter
esting as to be unreadable: then
various of the senior sponsors in
Wilbur Hall who have generally
not acted with vigor to adorn
with are and dignity those tacky
lounges and dismal dining halls
which are in some ways the final
assault upon humanity; finally
and most importantly the mem
bers of the band and the pom
pom girls who parade through
the library on the mornings of
football games, who are ritually
mocking and debasing the very
essence of Western liberal edu
cation.
My list could become endless,
and there we have the ambiguity.
Rather than open Pandora’s box
the Dean ought to recall Mr. Ef
ron and maintain the hope and
belief that, as has been traditional
in Western universities, good
taste and good manners will gen
erally develop, despite minor out
rages, in the free and inquiring
relationship of faculty and stu
dent.

Search-for-Cause
Recently the roar of the mob
and the bleat of the sheep have
been concerned with freedom;
i.e., the protest over suspension
of a source of obscene and pro
fane stories. Such protests, in the
name of freedom, are typical of
a. viewpoint which will next pro
test ahe purveyors of filthy pic
tures. It can be hoped that, in

time, these rebels-in-search-of-a
cause will mature. Until then, let
us be grateful for the cessation
of an open sewer.

Gung-ho

As a member of the recently
defunct Chaparral, I feel it is my
duty to express my regret for the
large amount of money our scur
rilous publication cost the Uni
versity. I feel obligated to pro
pose some type of remedy for
the financial problem our offend
ed donors have posed.
Therefore, I suggest we estab
lish a committee to daily scrape
the bat droppings off the obser
vation platform at the top of
Hoover Tower. There is undoubt
edly an untapped market for bat
guano in this area and once Stan
ford created the proper consumer
demand (one possible slogan:
“Flowers are gung-ho for Stan
ford dung-ho”) the money would
roll in. I do hope that this prac
tical suggestion will be of help,
as I feel my obligation deeply.
