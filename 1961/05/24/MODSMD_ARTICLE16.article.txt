## Defense Strategy In NATO 
### 
If, as is being said, there is a
crisis in NATO, the issue is not
the Atlantic Alliance itself, or any
movement within NATO to sur
render Berlin, and Germany, and
Europe. The basic issues in NA
TO are strategy and command.
Can the European members con
tinue to rely for their defense up
on the American nuclear deter
rent under the command of the
American President and an Am
erican General?

This question
can bo explored
but it cannot be
settled by the
NATO foreign
ministers at Os
lo. Unless I am
much mistaken,
it will be the cen
tral subject of
the serious dis
cussions when
President Ken

nedy visits President de Gaulle.
THESE discussions will not be
easy, and it would be a great pity
if the Administration built up any
public expectation, which would
almost certainly be false, that
there are going to be settlements
at Paris. The best that anyone
has a right to hope for is that the

two Presidents will reach a pre
liminary understanding of each
other, and can therefore lay the
foundations for those changes in
the strategy and structure of NA
TO which are necessary.

If I understand the problem
after a number of careful talks
in Paris, it is the consequence of
the change in the balance of
power since the Soviet Union
achieved nuclear parity. The NA
TO strategical doctrine antedates
this historic change. The NATO
military establishment, which was
founded under General Eisen
hower and is now commanded by
General Norstad, has been re
garded as the “shield.” It was to
hold the Red Army at bay while
the United States wielded the de
cisive weapon, which was then
our monopoly, the "sword” which
is the nuclear strategic air force.
This strategic conception has
been radically undermined by the
Soviet nuclear missile forces. The
most authoritative European view
is that since the Soviet Union is
now capable of inflicting prohibi
tive damage on the United States,
and absolute damage on the small
European countries, the auto
matic collective defense, which
NATO presupposes, cannot be
counted upon.
This is the root of the French
insistence upon having their own
deferents. They do not pretend
that they can deter attack any
where except against French ci
ties. Rightly or wrongly, the
French intend to have this nu
clear power under their own com
mand.
I SHALE be very much aston
ished if the President can argue
General de Gaulle out of this
view.
This is the crux of the problem.
But, of course, it is not the whole
problem. There is the exceed
ingly important French insistence
that in great affairs throughout
the world—the Formosa Strait,
Indo-China, Iran, the Congo, Cuba
