# Religion Found in Individual Student; Not Church Itself

If someone were searching for
religion at Stanford, he should not ,
expect to find it in the services of j
Memorial Church. According to
both chaplains of Memorial !
Church, religion at Stanford is
found in each student, not in the
church services themselves.
“Americans often make the mis-1
take of regarding numbers of |
worshippers and varieties of «erv-1
ices as measures of success in a |
church,” John Tirrell, assistant j
chaplain, explained.
AFTER making sure I realized
that “outward explosions are far \
from the whole story of Stanford ;
religion.” Chaplain Robert M. j
Minto listed the services which
Memorial Church holds.
It is an impressive list. Every J
Sunday there is the 9 o’clock I
Communion service and the 11 j
o’clock worship service. Daily }
prayer service is every morning |
at 7:40.
Each Wednesday night at 9:30
approximately 400 students attend
the candlelight service, which is
never publicized and always well I
attended. This is one of the signs
which makes Chaplain Minto i
think that “personal religion is a !
living force at Stanford.”
“ANYBODY is welcome to Me- !
morial Church,” Chaplain Minto |
explained. “The function of re- j
ligious work at a university is to j
policy should be made by j
French - British - American agree- |
ment, and not unilaterally by the |
United States.
Though I tried hard to under
stand just what this means, I am
not sure I do. I am not sure how
much of it is an appeal for con
sultation, which is so necessary
and so desirable, and how much
of it conceals the principle of
unanimous agreement, that is to
say, the veto.
It is line that in the field of
political consultation, the Ken
nedy administration has done bel
ter than its predecessor, and that
communication between the two
governments, both in Washington
and in Paris, is happily, much
more open. But it would be mis
leading to say that the atmos
phere is as cordial as it needs to
be, or that trust and confidence
between the two governments
have not in recent years been se
riously impaired.

l)e openminded, to leave an open
door for any believer or non
believer.”
Students have long wondered
how closely the chaplain is con
nected with the administration. In
answer to this question, Tirrell
said “100 per cent.” The next
question was “Does this restrict
you?” “No, not at all,” was Tir
rell’s answer.
TIRRELL explained “There is
not much danger that the Board
of Trustees will restrict the chap
lain. If you preach the gospel in
an orthodox way, this is what the
University expects to be done in
the church.”
Both Chaplain Minto and As
sistant Chaplain Tirrell think
that the students of Stanford are
religious.
As Tirrell put it, “a great many
of the students are deeply reli
gious without realizing it. Their
thoughts ore theological without
being caught up in the formalism
of church attendance.”
On occasion -students wonder
exactly how nondenominational
Memorial Church is. The services
resemble Episcopalian services,
and many of the speakers are
Episcopalian. Nevertheless, prom
inent religious thinkers of other
Protestant denominations and of
the Jewish faith are invited each
year to speak.
AT TIMES people are confused
or disappointed in the relation
ship between Memorial Church
and the various denominational
groups which are connected with
Stanford. Tirrell pinpointed the
problem when he said “Hopefully,
there is no feeling of limitation or
competition between the groups.”
Tirrell continued to speak for
Memorial Church when he said,
“We welcome their (referring to
denominational chaplains) help at
all times. We look upon their
work and ours as of equal impor
tance.”
Tirrell answered the denomina
tional request to be given some
where to meet on campus. He ex
plained that the founding grant
of the University stated “no sec
tarian meetings on campus.”
“The problem with a building
for church meetings,” Tirrell said
“is that it might tie the denomina
tional chaplains down more than
it would help them got to know
their students better.”
