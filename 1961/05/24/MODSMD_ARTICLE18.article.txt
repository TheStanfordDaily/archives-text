Just Some Comments
Today: Just some notes and comments on various events of the
past week. We’ll start with the Big Five golf championships held
last weekend on the Rainier Country Club course in Seattle.
Probably the most unusual happening of the AAWU tourney was
a once-in-a-lifetime performance by John Guisto who plays in the
first slot for. the Berkeley Bear linksters 'cross the Bay,
All John did was shoot back-to-back eagles on the 10th and 11th
holes on the Rainier layout. The 10th is a 375-yard par four and
Guisto got his two by holing out with a full nine iron; the 11th is
another par four, a rugged 445-yard challenge. John dittoed his two
on the previous hole by sinking another iron, this time using a three.

That’s equivalent to two-holes
in-one on consecutive holes!
John went on to card a one
under par 71 for the 18, but he
couldn’t duplicate his magic on
the following rounds and finished
far hack of the leaders.
After watching the hotshot
colelgiate swingers take their
course apart, the Rainier Club
members must have fell a little
frustrated. The winning Univer
sity of Washington Huskies had a
four-man score of 1181, an aver
age of just one and a fraction
strokes over par per 18 holes for
each man. Then on the final day,
with a slight trailing wind, most
of the college linksters were driv
ing on, or just short of the 315-
yard 18th. Frustrating, no?
Some people may have been
surprised to see Clint Names, who
is probably better known for his

basketball skills, win the league individual crown with a pro-type
score of 286. Clint, however, is no stranger to the links; he has
played consistently good golf in high school and college tournaments,
having taken medalist honors in the Washington State high school
tourney in his pre-UW days and placing fourth in the AAWU last
year.
Names picked up many strokes by solving the slow, grainy,
breaking greens that bothered many of the Californians.
There was one ironic note for Card golf coach Bud Finger as
Jack Lamey, who was an All-American golfer at the Farm before
transferring to Washington, returned to haunt his former teammates
in the Big Five affair. Although he shot an 81 in the first round,
Lamey was instrumental in helping the Huskies win their first title
as he caught fire with rounds of 75. 73 and 70.
Three months ago coach Finger predicted that Lamey would be
one of the golfers to watch in the league championships; unfortu
nately he was right.
An interesting fact is that three of UW's varsity swingers are
graduates of Everett High School’s powerful golf team which has
won the state crown for six consecutive years. Last year Everett
had a team score of 289 versus a par of 288 for the four-man, 36-hole
event. At that rate they could win the NCAA!
Just one more comment on the AAWU tournament, or rather on
the Seattle weather. Friday it was 90 in the Puget Sound metropolis;
Saturday it was 55, windy and raining. A slight change in clime.
Sticking with the same sport for awhile, but moving to a different
event, Steve Smith just won the All-University golf tournament by
beating Bill Farish, 5 and 4. If the names Smith and Parish sound
a little familiar, they ought to. Smith is the third man on the Stan
ford varsity and Farish is number one.
A couple of other “unknowns,” Bill Seanor and Phil Underwood,
got ousted in the semifinals. Seanor was a member of last year’s
varsity and placed second in the AAWU that season while Under
wood is the fourth man on this year's contingent. 1960 AAWU champ
Pete Choate. Underwood and Mike Kuhlman all tied for medalist
honors with 73's.

Encouraging Signs
We note several encouraging signs in Ihe football outlook for
Stanford after last Saturday's alumni game.
The most significant single feature of the fray was the varsity’s
surprising ability to score. Last season the Card’s demonstrated an
amazing ineptness in moving the ball, tallying only 111 points in ten
games and being held to one touchdown in half of their starts.
Against the Alums, Jack Curtice's crew scored 17 points and the
Indians may be learning some new habits.
At the same (imo the Redskin eleven showed just as much im
provement in defense as they held the grade to 13 counters. In 1960
the locals gave up an average of almost four touchdowns per game
and they limited only one team, (he Washington State Cougars to
less than 21 points.
With progress like that shown last Saturday we shouldn’t do
any worse this fall.

had a team score of 289 versus a par of 288 for the four-man, 36-hole
event. At that rate they could win the NCAA!
Just one more comment on the AAWU tournament, or rather on
the Seattle weather. Friday it was 90 in the Puget Sound metropolis;
Saturday it was 55, windy and raining. A slight change in clime.
Sticking with the same sport for awhile, but moving to a different
event, Steve Smith just won the All-University golf tournament by
beating Bill Farish, 5 and 4. If the names Smith and Parish sound
a little familiar, they ought to. Smith is the third man on the Stan
ford varsity and Farish is number one.
A couple of other “unknowns,” Bill Seanor and Phil Underwood,
got ousted in the semifinals. Seanor was a member of last year’s
varsity and placed second in the AAWU that season while Under
wood is the fourth man on this year's contingent. 1960 AAWU champ
Pete Choate. Underwood and Mike Kuhlman all tied for medalist
honors with 73's.

Encouraging Signs
We note several encouraging signs in Ihe football outlook for
Stanford after last Saturday's alumni game.
The most significant single feature of the fray was the varsity’s
surprising ability to score. Last season the Card’s demonstrated an
amazing ineptness in moving the ball, tallying only 111 points in ten
games and being held to one touchdown in half of their starts.
Against the Alums, Jack Curtice's crew scored 17 points and the
Indians may be learning some new habits.
At the same (imo the Redskin eleven showed just as much im
provement in defense as they held the grade to 13 counters. In 1960
the locals gave up an average of almost four touchdowns per game
and they limited only one team, (he Washington State Cougars to
less than 21 points.
With progress like that shown last Saturday we shouldn’t do
any worse this fall.

Just Some Comments
Today: Just some notes and comments on various events of the
past week. We’ll start with the Big Five golf championships held
last weekend on the Rainier Country Club course in Seattle.
Probably the most unusual happening of the AAWU tourney was
a once-in-a-lifetime performance by John Guisto who plays in the
first slot for. the Berkeley Bear linksters 'cross the Bay,
All John did was shoot back-to-back eagles on the 10th and 11th
holes on the Rainier layout. The 10th is a 375-yard par four and
Guisto got his two by holing out with a full nine iron; the 11th is
another par four, a rugged 445-yard challenge. John dittoed his two
on the previous hole by sinking another iron, this time using a three.

That’s equivalent to two-holes
in-one on consecutive holes!
John went on to card a one
under par 71 for the 18, but he
couldn’t duplicate his magic on
the following rounds and finished
far hack of the leaders.
After watching the hotshot
colelgiate swingers take their
course apart, the Rainier Club
members must have fell a little
frustrated. The winning Univer
sity of Washington Huskies had a
four-man score of 1181, an aver
age of just one and a fraction
strokes over par per 18 holes for
each man. Then on the final day,
with a slight trailing wind, most
of the college linksters were driv
ing on, or just short of the 315-
yard 18th. Frustrating, no?
Some people may have been
surprised to see Clint Names, who
is probably better known for his

basketball skills, win the league individual crown with a pro-type
score of 286. Clint, however, is no stranger to the links; he has
played consistently good golf in high school and college tournaments,
having taken medalist honors in the Washington State high school
tourney in his pre-UW days and placing fourth in the AAWU last
year.
Names picked up many strokes by solving the slow, grainy,
breaking greens that bothered many of the Californians.
There was one ironic note for Card golf coach Bud Finger as
Jack Lamey, who was an All-American golfer at the Farm before
transferring to Washington, returned to haunt his former teammates
in the Big Five affair. Although he shot an 81 in the first round,
Lamey was instrumental in helping the Huskies win their first title
as he caught fire with rounds of 75. 73 and 70.
Three months ago coach Finger predicted that Lamey would be
one of the golfers to watch in the league championships; unfortu
nately he was right.
An interesting fact is that three of UW's varsity swingers are
graduates of Everett High School’s powerful golf team which has
won the state crown for six consecutive years. Last year Everett
had a team score of 289 versus a par of 288 for the four-man, 36-hole

John went on to card a one
under par 71 for the 18, but he
couldn’t duplicate his magic on
the following rounds and finished
far hack of the leaders.
After watching the hotshot
colelgiate swingers take their
course apart, the Rainier Club
members must have fell a little
frustrated. The winning Univer
sity of Washington Huskies had a
four-man score of 1181, an aver
age of just one and a fraction
strokes over par per 18 holes for
each man. Then on the final day,
with a slight trailing wind, most
of the college linksters were driv
ing on, or just short of the 315-
yard 18th. Frustrating, no?
Some people may have been
surprised to see Clint Names, who
is probably better known for his

basketball skills, win the league individual crown with a pro-type
score of 286. Clint, however, is no stranger to the links; he has
played consistently good golf in high school and college tournaments,
having taken medalist honors in the Washington State high school
tourney in his pre-UW days and placing fourth in the AAWU last
year.
Names picked up many strokes by solving the slow, grainy,
breaking greens that bothered many of the Californians.
There was one ironic note for Card golf coach Bud Finger as
Jack Lamey, who was an All-American golfer at the Farm before
transferring to Washington, returned to haunt his former teammates
in the Big Five affair. Although he shot an 81 in the first round,
Lamey was instrumental in helping the Huskies win their first title
as he caught fire with rounds of 75. 73 and 70.
Three months ago coach Finger predicted that Lamey would be
one of the golfers to watch in the league championships; unfortu
nately he was right.
An interesting fact is that three of UW's varsity swingers are
graduates of Everett High School’s powerful golf team which has
won the state crown for six consecutive years. Last year Everett
had a team score of 289 versus a par of 288 for the four-man, 36-hole
event. At that rate they could win the NCAA!
Just one more comment on the AAWU tournament, or rather on
the Seattle weather. Friday it was 90 in the Puget Sound metropolis;
Saturday it was 55, windy and raining. A slight change in clime.
Sticking with the same sport for awhile, but moving to a different
event, Steve Smith just won the All-University golf tournament by
beating Bill Farish, 5 and 4. If the names Smith and Parish sound
a little familiar, they ought to. Smith is the third man on the Stan
ford varsity and Farish is number one.
A couple of other “unknowns,” Bill Seanor and Phil Underwood,
got ousted in the semifinals. Seanor was a member of last year’s
varsity and placed second in the AAWU that season while Under
wood is the fourth man on this year's contingent. 1960 AAWU champ
Pete Choate. Underwood and Mike Kuhlman all tied for medalist
honors with 73's.

Encouraging Signs
We note several encouraging signs in Ihe football outlook for
Stanford after last Saturday's alumni game.
The most significant single feature of the fray was the varsity’s
surprising ability to score. Last season the Card’s demonstrated an
amazing ineptness in moving the ball, tallying only 111 points in ten
games and being held to one touchdown in half of their starts.
Against the Alums, Jack Curtice's crew scored 17 points and the
Indians may be learning some new habits.
At the same (imo the Redskin eleven showed just as much im
provement in defense as they held the grade to 13 counters. In 1960
the locals gave up an average of almost four touchdowns per game
and they limited only one team, (he Washington State Cougars to
less than 21 points.
With progress like that shown last Saturday we shouldn’t do
any worse this fall.

Just Some Comments
Today: Just some notes and comments on various events of the
past week. We’ll start with the Big Five golf championships held
last weekend on the Rainier Country Club course in Seattle.
Probably the most unusual happening of the AAWU tourney was
a once-in-a-lifetime performance by John Guisto who plays in the
first slot for. the Berkeley Bear linksters 'cross the Bay,
All John did was shoot back-to-back eagles on the 10th and 11th
holes on the Rainier layout. The 10th is a 375-yard par four and
Guisto got his two by holing out with a full nine iron; the 11th is
another par four, a rugged 445-yard challenge. John dittoed his two
on the previous hole by sinking another iron, this time using a three.

That’s equivalent to two-holes
in-one on consecutive holes!
