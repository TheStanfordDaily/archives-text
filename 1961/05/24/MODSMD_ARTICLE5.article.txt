# Mosk Awaits Administration Action on Fiji Pledge Prank
## Action by Ala. Gov. Needed—Atty.Gen. 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPl)—Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy said
yesterday U.S. marshals would be withdrawn from Alabama as soon
as Gov. John Patterson and local officials proved by action, rather
than words, that they could stop race riots.
'T assure you that we have no intention of permitting the marshals

to remain in Alabama a minute
longer than necessary,” he told
the state’s congressional delega

tion in a telegram.
“WITH VOUK assistance and
cooperation I would hope that
they could be withdrawn at an
early date.”

Alabama’s senators and House
members demanded Monday that
Kennedy withdraw the marshals,
sent to Montgomery Saturday to
quell riots touched off by the in
tegrated “freedom ride” through
the South.

The Attorney General replied
that the 600 federal agents were
sent to the Deep South state be
cause mobs continued to attack
the riders despite assurances by
Patterson that local officials could
handle the trouble.
“WHAT IS needed now is ac
tion on the part of Gov. Patter
son and local law enforcement
officers, not merely words of in
tention,” Kennedy said.
He said, however, that there
had been close cooperation be
tween federal and state law en
forcement officials since Patter
son called out the National Guard
when a mob menaced a negro
meeting in a church Sunday
night.
Justice Department press offi
cer Edwin O. Guthman earlier de
scribed the atmosphere in Ala
bama as “an uneasy calm.” He
said the situation was touch-and
go. He said the marshals would
remain on the sidelines as long
as state and local officials main
tained order.
GUTHMAN also declared “cat
egorically” that no federal mar
shals had been sent ahead to Jack
son, Miss., next scheduled stop
for the freedom riders. While he
rlid not say so, the Administra
tion clearly was anxious to avoid
stirring up emotions in the area.
A Mississippi senator, Demo
crat John Stennis, said tonight

he will introduce a bill to make
“freedom rides” a federal offense.
Assistant Attorney General
Nicholas Katzenbach said in a
morning TV interview (Today,
NBC) that law and order had
been restored “only in a very
limited sense.”
Officials here will not rest easy
until the “freedom riders” leave
Alabama. About 20 of the youths
are in hiding in Montgomery.
The Rev. Martin Luther King an
nounced they would move on to
Mississippi to test bus segrega
tion there. But he did not say
when.
