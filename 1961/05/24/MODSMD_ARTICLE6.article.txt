# 200 Protest Race Violence
## 
### 
Two hundred Stanford stu
dents and faculty have signed
a petition protesting the race
violence in Alabama. The pe
tition begins “We, the under
signed, condemn the failure
of Alabama law enforcement
agencies to protect American
citizens exercising their con
stitutionally granted rights.”
Today is the last day that
the petition will be on Engi
neering Corner. It will be
sent this afternoon to Gover
nor John Patterson of Ala
bama and to Attorney Gen
eral Robert Kennedy, “in
hopes that they will realize
that something should be
done.”

Tom Mayer, graduate stu
dent and research assistant
in sociology, and John How
ard, graduate student and
teaching assistant in sociolo
gy, are two of the individuals
who are circulating the peti
tion.

The petition is a result of
student concern, not of any
national organization.
