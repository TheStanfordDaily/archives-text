# Neutral Laos Best U.S. Hope

### ELIZABETH FREEMAN 
"The wrong side so far as we
are concerned is winning” the
Laotian struggle. Prof. Claude A.
Buss declared in a Tuesday Eve
ning Series talk last night.
The Stanford professor, for
merly assistant to the U.S. High
Commissioner in the Philippines,
returned in January from a trip
to the Far East which included
Laos.

He described the change in
American foreign policy toward
Laos from the time of former
Ambassador Jeff Parsons. Then
the U.S. tried to prevent Laos
from forming a coalition govern
ment with the Communists—a
situation seen in China. The Ken
nedy administration, as of March
3, demands only “an independent
and a neutral Laos.”
UNDER the present policy, “if
we can get a neutral government
in Laos, this is as much as we can
hope for ... wo are not strong
enough to say that we want a
neutral Laos that will be on our
side,” Buss said.
The beginning of Western in
fluence in Laos was in 1894, when
the French took command of the
government, and ruled loosely in
combination with the Laotian
king until 1954, except for a pe
riod in World War II during

Hope for neutrality
which the Japanese drove the
French out.
DURING this period of the
French absence Prince Souphan
auvong, present leader of the
Communist-led Pathet Lao, met
with the head of the North Viet
namese movement, and from here
tried to inject into the Laotians
ideas of independence, from the
French, along with communism.
In 1954 France, when she recog
nized her defeat in the Indo-Chi
nese war, called a Geneva meet
ing to negotiate with Cambodia,
Laos, and Viet Nam. Laos said
she wanted to be independent but
to remain within the French
union. She also wanted to inte
grate the two Communist town
ships in northeastern Laos, along
with some Communist military
units, into the government.
IN 1957 a coalition government
was formed wtih the two Com
munist-held provinces in north
eastern Laos.
Since August of 1960 there have
been three rival governmental
factions in Laos, the pro-Western
Premier Phoumi, the ousted for
mer premier, "neutralist” Prince
Souvanna Phouma, and his half
brother Prince Souphanouvong,
leader of the Communist-led Pa
thet Lao.
The Pathet Lao has "a great
deal of physical power,” Buss
said, which is spreading. They
naturally want to forestall peace
negotiation talks with the West
so they can continue to expand,
while the West wants an immedi
ate cease-fire in order to halt ex
pansion.
“THIS IS not only a matter of
the cold war between ourselves
and the Russians and the Chi
nese,” he emphasized. A much
greater concern is the “fate and
welfare of these two million peo
ple that live in Laos itself.”
The U.S. must recognize “the
way we have overemphasized the
military parts,” rather than the
"fundamental problems” of the
Laotians, he said.
