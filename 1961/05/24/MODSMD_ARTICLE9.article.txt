(EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is a summary of a speech given
at last week-end’s alumni conference by Graham H. Stuart, professor
emeritus of political science.)
In regard to Cuba even before the invasion—President Kennedy
declared “Wo do not intend to he pushed around any longer; we will
hold Guantanamo and require fair compensation for American prop
erty seized.”
The State Department issued a White Paper on Cuba graphically
pointing out “the clear and present danger of the Castro regime to
the United States.” President Castro has violated every promise and
guarantee of the revolution. Two-thirds of the cabinet of the revo
lutionary government including the prime minister and the provi
sional president are imprisoned or in exile.
OVER .850 million worth of armaments has been obtained from
Iron Curtain countries. The Castro regime has supported invasions
or encouraged riots in more than a half dozen Latin American Re
publics. President Castro has declared publicly that he had no faith
in the organization of American States and that Cuba is not bound
by the Rio Treaties.
The invasion planned by refugee Cubans long before the Kennedy
Administration and supported by CIA and the Pentagon put the
President on the spot. Should he permit the most flagrant violation
of the Monroe Doctrine since Napoleon 111 invaded Mexico and one
which threatened all Latin America?
Ho approved the invasion but with no American armed interven
tion. With expected local support lacking the landing was a fiasco
and the United States was pilloried at home and abroad.
BET WHILE accepting the responsibility for our Cuban policy,
President Kennedy received a deserved ovation when on April 20
before the American Society of Newspaper Editors he declared “Our
restraint is not inexhaustible; if the nations of this hemisphere fail
to meet their commitments against Communist penetration this gov
ernment will not hesitate in meeting its primary obligations which
are to the security of our own nation.”
The present danger in Southeast Asia is serious and Berlin is ever
threatening, but in Berlin our policy is clear. Secretary of State
Dean Rusk has declared: “Our forces are to remain and we will pro
tect the city and its inhabitants we will not yield the rights of the
West in any compromise or surrender.”
THE AMERICAN system makes the President responsible for our
foreign policy and President Kennedy has gladly assumed the obli
gation. Even before his election he declared that the President of

the United States will have to lead and to lead fast. He said he was
tired of reading what Khrushchev and Castro were doing. He wanted
to read what the United States was doing.
His selection of Rusk as Secretary of State, passing over such
outstanding figures as Adlai Stevenson, Chester Bowles, Averell
Hardman and Senator William Fulbright. gave evidence of his inten
tion to captain the ship of state. He preferred an able man already
experienced in the office but one whose prestige might not be a
handicap to him in the conduct of foreign policy.
Nevertheless by naming Bowles as under Secretary of State, Stev
enson as Ambassador to the United Nations, Hardman as ambassa
dor-at-large, Bohlen as adviser on Soviet Affairs, he had a veritable
galaxy of talent to advise him.

HIS DECLARED intention of using tlie career service more fully
and naming George Kennan as Ambassador to Yugoslavia. Fredcrich
Reinhardt as Ambassador to Italy and retaining Llewellyn Thomp
son as Ambassador to Russia and Freeman Mathews as Ambassador
to Austria were merely representative of the emphasis on career
officers named to important posts.

Even David Bruce, the new Ambassador to Great Britain, had
not only previous experiencs as under Secretary of State and as
Ambassador to France and Germany hut in his youth had entered
and served several years as a career foreign service officer.
While strongly favoring the maintenance of peace, a new world
of law, and the limitation of armament, the President is realistic in
his attitude toward national defense. He has not only supported a
rapid increase in our nuclear striking power and air defense but
feels the need of a balanced force with increased strength in conven
tional weapons and increased trained forces for guerrilla and brush
fire warfare.

HE HAS RENEWED his pledge of support to the U.N. and favors
consolidating and strengthening NATO and SEATO. Secretary Rusk
in the recent SEATO conference has obtained the promise of military
support from Great Britain, Thailand, the Philippines and Pakistan
if the United Stales decides to resist aggression in Viet Nam.
President Kennedy has proposed a new alliance for progress in
Latin America and has outlined a new ten-point program with $6OO
million already appropriated to carrying it out.
Let us conclude with President Kennedy’s clear-cut statement of
policy; “Let every nation know that we shall pay any price, bear any
burden, support any friend, oppose any foe to secure the survival
and success of liberty.”
