TILL WE MEET AGAIN
Seven years now I have been writing this column for the
makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and each year when I come to
the last column of the year, my heart is gripped by the same
bittersweet feeling. I shall miss you sorely, dear readers, in the
long summer days ahead. I shall miss all you freckle-faced
boys with frogs in your pockets. I shall miss all you pig-tailed
girls with your gap-toothed giggles. I shall miss you one and
all—your shining morning faces, your apples, your marbles,
your jacks, your little oilcloth satchels.
Rut I shall not be entirely sad, for you have given me many
a happy memory to sustain me. It has been a rare pleasure
writing this column for 3-011 all 3’ear, and I would ask every
one of 3'ou to come visit me during the summer except there is
no access to my room. The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes,
after I missed several deadlines, walled me in. All I have is
a mail slot into which I drop 1113- columns and through which
they supply me with Marlboro Cigarettes and such food as
will slip through a mail slot. (For six months now I have been
living on after-dinner mints.)

T am only having m 3' little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not walled me in. They could never do such a cruel thing.
Manly and muscular they ma3’ be, and gruff and curt and direct,
but underneath they are men of great heart and sweet, com
passionate disposition, and I wish to take this opportunity to
state publicly that I will always have the highest regard for
the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, no matter how my lawsuit
for back wages comes out.
I am only having my little joke. I am not suing the makers
of Marlboros for back wages. These honorable gentlemen have
always paid me promptly and in full. To be sure, they have not
paid me in cosh, but they have given me something far more
precious. You would go far to find one so covered with tattoos as I.
I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not covered me with tattoos. In fact, they have engraved
no commercial advertising whatsoever on my person. M3 r suit,
of course, is another matter, but even here they have exercised
taste and restraint. On the back of my suit, in unobtrusive
neon, the 3' have put this fetching little jingle:
Are your taste buds out of kilter?
Arc you bored with smoking, neighbor 7
Then try that splendid Marlboro fdler,
Try that excellent Marlboro fleighbor!
On the front of my suit, in muted phosphorus, are pictures of
the members of the Marlboro board and their families. On my
hat is a small cigarette girl crying, “Who’ll buy my Marlboros?’’
I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have been perfect dolls to work for, and so, dear readers, have
you. Your kind response to my nonsense has warmed this old
thorax, and I trust you will not find me soggy if in this final
column of the year, I express my sincere gratitude.
Have a good summer. Stay healthy. Stay happy. Stay loose.

T am only having m 3' little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not walled me in. They could never do such a cruel thing.
Manly and muscular they ma3’ be, and gruff and curt and direct,
but underneath they are men of great heart and sweet, com
passionate disposition, and I wish to take this opportunity to
state publicly that I will always have the highest regard for
the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, no matter how my lawsuit
for back wages comes out.
I am only having my little joke. I am not suing the makers
of Marlboros for back wages. These honorable gentlemen have
always paid me promptly and in full. To be sure, they have not
paid me in cosh, but they have given me something far more
precious. You would go far to find one so covered with tattoos as I.
I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have not covered me with tattoos. In fact, they have engraved
no commercial advertising whatsoever on my person. M3 r suit,
of course, is another matter, but even here they have exercised
taste and restraint. On the back of my suit, in unobtrusive
neon, the 3' have put this fetching little jingle:
Are your taste buds out of kilter?
Arc you bored with smoking, neighbor 7
Then try that splendid Marlboro fdler,
Try that excellent Marlboro fleighbor!
On the front of my suit, in muted phosphorus, are pictures of
the members of the Marlboro board and their families. On my
hat is a small cigarette girl crying, “Who’ll buy my Marlboros?’’
I am only having my little joke. The makers of Marlboros
have been perfect dolls to work for, and so, dear readers, have
you. Your kind response to my nonsense has warmed this old
thorax, and I trust you will not find me soggy if in this final
column of the year, I express my sincere gratitude.
Have a good summer. Stay healthy. Stay happy. Stay loose.

Seven years now I have been writing this column for the
makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and each year when I come to
the last column of the year, my heart is gripped by the same
bittersweet feeling. I shall miss you sorely, dear readers, in the
long summer days ahead. I shall miss all you freckle-faced
boys with frogs in your pockets. I shall miss all you pig-tailed
girls with your gap-toothed giggles. I shall miss you one and
all—your shining morning faces, your apples, your marbles,
your jacks, your little oilcloth satchels.
Rut I shall not be entirely sad, for you have given me many
a happy memory to sustain me. It has been a rare pleasure
writing this column for 3-011 all 3’ear, and I would ask every
one of 3'ou to come visit me during the summer except there is
no access to my room. The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes,
after I missed several deadlines, walled me in. All I have is
a mail slot into which I drop 1113- columns and through which
they supply me with Marlboro Cigarettes and such food as
will slip through a mail slot. (For six months now I have been
living on after-dinner mints.)
