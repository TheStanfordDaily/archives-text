# 'Peer Gynt' to Open In Frost Tonight
## 
### 
A cast of nearly 100 will act and dance in Frost Amphitheatre at
8:30 tonight, tomorrow night and Saturday when the Stanford Play
ers present Henrik Ibsen's "Peer Gynt."
Unlike Ibsen's other plays, "Peer Gynt" is not primarily a drama
of social criticism, but rather a play about one man's attempt to find

out what is worthwhile in life.
The play, which is based on a
group of Norwegian fairy tales,
is set in Norway, Arabia, and
Africa. Giant-sized Troll masks
have been designed- by Lawrence
Wismer for Peer’s encounter with
the Troll civilization in the moun
tains.
Leading members of the cast
include Philip Angeloff as Peer
Gynt; Georgia Ryther as the girl
Solveg; Lisa Lauterer as Aase,
the mother; and Hugh Evans as
the king of the Trolls.
The play is under the direction
of Robert Loper, with original
music composed by Leonard Rat
ner. Choregraphy is by Marianne
Croweder. Sets were designed by
Richard Hay, costume design by
Irene Griffin and lighting design
is the work of Paul Landry and
Robert Levin.

Student tickets are on sale at
Memorial Auditorium box office,
DA 3-0665, for $2 and $1.50. Tick
ets for the general public are
$2.50 and $2.
