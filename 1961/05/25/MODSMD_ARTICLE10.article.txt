# PAIR 'JUST CAN'T STOP, NOW'
## South African 
### JERRY RANKIN 
Tw’o perky, adventurous South
African girls who “just can’t
stop” are thumbing their way
east as they enter the second year
of a hitch hiking trip around the
world.
The pair left Palo Alto Monday
morning, bound for Norfolk. Va.,
and points east—via thumb.
The two South Africans are
Edith (Edy) Tyson, 22, and Fiona
(Fifi) Foster, 23. They arrived in
Palo Alto via Los Angeles, Puerto
their thumbing across the U.S.
Rico, the Virgin Islands, Europe
and Capetown, South Africa
Where their trek began in April
1960.
AFTER A swing through the
eastern United Slates, the girls
plan to thumb their way, back

j across country and then hop a
ship steaming for the Orient.
They expect to be on the road
for “about another two years,”
j although as Edy puts it, “We
don’t know how long it will take.
I We just can’t stop, now.”
The idea for the journey came
i when the two were talking over
plans for a trip to Europe, which
I most daughters of white South
1 Africans make before they return
j to South Africa and marry.
BOTH ARE against early mar
riages and wanted to travel, Fifi’s
parents, who are dairy farmers,
and Edy’s, who run a citrus farm,
agreed when the girls proposed a
hitch • hiking trip around the
world.
So the two attractive girls left
their homos near Capetown little
more than a yeqr ago and landed
in France. They hitch - hiked
through most of the European
nations for a few months in the
first stage of their plan to prow
that girls CAN hitch-hike without
undue trouble.
They encountered no problems
in Europe, where hitch-hiking by
students is common, and where
j often “there are rows of you
I along the road.” Edy said.
1 AMERICANS they met in Eu
-1 rope were against the idea of
j "They said we’d never, never bo
j able to do it in the States,” Edy
j smilingly recalled.
Undaunted, the girls searched
j for away to reach America and
j eventually found free passage on
I the racing yacht “Escapade” to the
I Virgin Islands, in return for their
j serving as cooks on the voyage.
They remained in the islands
j for two months “seeing what was
there” and then caught a shrimp
j boat for Puerto Rico. From
there, an American millionaire
| gave them free passage on one of
his cement ships to Florida,
where they debarked early this
i March.

Tw’o perky, adventurous South
African girls who “just can’t
stop” are thumbing their way
east as they enter the second year
of a hitch hiking trip around the
world.
The pair left Palo Alto Monday
morning, bound for Norfolk. Va.,
and points east—via thumb.
The two South Africans are
Edith (Edy) Tyson, 22, and Fiona
(Fifi) Foster, 23. They arrived in
Palo Alto via Los Angeles, Puerto
their thumbing across the U.S.
Rico, the Virgin Islands, Europe
and Capetown, South Africa
Where their trek began in April
1960.
AFTER A swing through the
eastern United Slates, the girls
plan to thumb their way, back

j across country and then hop a
ship steaming for the Orient.
They expect to be on the road
for “about another two years,”
j although as Edy puts it, “We
don’t know how long it will take.
I We just can’t stop, now.”
The idea for the journey came
i when the two were talking over
plans for a trip to Europe, which
I most daughters of white South
1 Africans make before they return
j to South Africa and marry.
BOTH ARE against early mar
riages and wanted to travel, Fifi’s
parents, who are dairy farmers,
and Edy’s, who run a citrus farm,
agreed when the girls proposed a
hitch • hiking trip around the
world.
So the two attractive girls left
their homos near Capetown little
more than a yeqr ago and landed
in France. They hitch - hiked
through most of the European
nations for a few months in the
first stage of their plan to prow
that girls CAN hitch-hike without
undue trouble.
They encountered no problems
in Europe, where hitch-hiking by
students is common, and where
j often “there are rows of you
I along the road.” Edy said.
1 AMERICANS they met in Eu
-1 rope were against the idea of
j "They said we’d never, never bo
j able to do it in the States,” Edy
j smilingly recalled.
Undaunted, the girls searched
j for away to reach America and
j eventually found free passage on
I the racing yacht “Escapade” to the
I Virgin Islands, in return for their
j serving as cooks on the voyage.
They remained in the islands
j for two months “seeing what was
there” and then caught a shrimp
j boat for Puerto Rico. From
there, an American millionaire
