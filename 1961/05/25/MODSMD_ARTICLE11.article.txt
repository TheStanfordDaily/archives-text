# Girls Thumbing Around World
## 
### 
FROM FLORIDA they headed
through the South to Los Angeles
and then up the coast to this area.
Nowhere in the U.S. have Edy
and Fifi had trouble because of
their unescorted journey. Their
only protection is a hat pin Fifi
carries and a well-thought-out
hitch-hiking system.
Since “We don’t push our
selves,” the girls choose carefully
the rifles they accept. They never
ride after 5 p.m. or with two men.
Nor do they accept a lift from
someone their well-developed and
fast-working sense of sizing up
people warns them against.
NORMALLY they wind up rid
ing with traveling businessmen.
The girls note that a single wo
man or a man and woman to
gether in a car never offer them
a ride.

One interesting comment on
American drivers is that almost
every person who picks them up
warns them that he is unusual
and that (hey will have a tough
time getting rides.
They travel where the weather
is warm, as each carries only a
small bag of clothing. “We have
n’t had a winter in four seasons,”
Edy said. “We go from beach to
beach,” she added.

IN THEIR trip across the U.S.
the pair has stayed - in Salvation
Army quarters, bus depots, at
homes of friends or friends-of
friends they met in Europe, and,
at last resort in unlocked car's in
parking lots.
They also have spent the night
in a museum and look forward
to lodging in a bakery for a night.
Ealing has presented no prob
lem, as they manage to obtain
free meals quite often or else
spend small amounts of the al
most-intact stake I hey left home
with,
COMPARING Americans and
Europeans they’ve met in their
travels, the girls feel “Americans

are more aware of what’s going
on in other countries and about
other people,” taut too often tend
to judge other peoples and na
tions in comparison with the
United States.

“California is the first state
where we've really felt at home,”
the girls said. They pointed out
that Californians haven’t found
anything unusual in their garb
(slacks, thongs, T-shirts) as hap
pened in other states.

They were “very impressed” by
a visit to Stanford. The “well-in
formed, well-read women” par
ticularly caught their notice.

“ON THE whole we have been
disappointed in American girls,”
Edy declaied. “They feel if they
are not married by 20 or 21 they
are old maids. They are not will
ing to go out and travel and ma
ture before they settle down,” she

stressed.
While at Stanford they visited
a fraternity and had pancakes at
Lagunita. They also bought the
first two copies of Vagabond, the
travel information booklet on sale
this week by the Stanford Over
seas Information Service section
of the UR.

“We have had people refuse to
speak to us,” beeau.se we
are from South Africa, Edy said.
However, both she and Fifi are
members of the United Party,
which opposes the strong segre
gationist stand of the South Afri
can government.
NONE THE LESS, “We never
have been treated so well as in
America,” they said. Both must
leave the country by November,
when their tourist visas expire.
Their parents are taking the
trip “amazingly well” Edy says.
Her parents say her letters arc
“like a serial” and look forward
to the regular correspondence
eagerly.

i When it's all over, Edy wants
! to write a book about the trip,
j and Fifi who has a B.A. in teach-
I ing wants to study and perhaps
’ return to the U.S.

j But that’s all in the future.
Right now their concern is get
ting to the East, back across the
country and then to the Orient.
They’ll make it, thumbhow.

“We have had people refuse to

can government.
NONE THE LESS, “We never

America,” they said. Both must

“GOING OUR WAY?”
Two South African girls hitch-hiking their way around the
world give once-over to possible ride on campus. At left is
Edy Tyson, and at right pointing in direction the girls are
bound is Fifi Foster.
FROM FLORIDA they headed
through the South to Los Angeles
and then up the coast to this area.
Nowhere in the U.S. have Edy
and Fifi had trouble because of
their unescorted journey. Their
only protection is a hat pin Fifi
carries and a well-thought-out
hitch-hiking system.
Since “We don’t push our
selves,” the girls choose carefully
the rifles they accept. They never
ride after 5 p.m. or with two men.
Nor do they accept a lift from
someone their well-developed and
fast-working sense of sizing up
people warns them against.
NORMALLY they wind up rid
ing with traveling businessmen.
The girls note that a single wo
man or a man and woman to
gether in a car never offer them
a ride.

One interesting comment on
American drivers is that almost
every person who picks them up
warns them that he is unusual
and that (hey will have a tough
time getting rides.
They travel where the weather
is warm, as each carries only a
small bag of clothing. “We have
n’t had a winter in four seasons,”
Edy said. “We go from beach to
beach,” she added.

IN THEIR trip across the U.S.
the pair has stayed - in Salvation
Army quarters, bus depots, at
homes of friends or friends-of
friends they met in Europe, and,
at last resort in unlocked car's in
parking lots.
They also have spent the night
in a museum and look forward
to lodging in a bakery for a night.
Ealing has presented no prob
lem, as they manage to obtain
free meals quite often or else
spend small amounts of the al
most-intact stake I hey left home
with,
COMPARING Americans and
Europeans they’ve met in their
travels, the girls feel “Americans

are more aware of what’s going
on in other countries and about
other people,” taut too often tend
to judge other peoples and na
tions in comparison with the
United States.

“California is the first state
where we've really felt at home,”

only protection is a hat pin Fifi
carries and a well-thought-out
hitch-hiking system.
Since “We don’t push our
selves,” the girls choose carefully
the rifles they accept. They never
ride after 5 p.m. or with two men.
Nor do they accept a lift from
someone their well-developed and
fast-working sense of sizing up
people warns them against.
NORMALLY they wind up rid
ing with traveling businessmen.
The girls note that a single wo
man or a man and woman to
gether in a car never offer them
a ride.

One interesting comment on
American drivers is that almost
every person who picks them up
warns them that he is unusual
and that (hey will have a tough
time getting rides.
They travel where the weather
is warm, as each carries only a
small bag of clothing. “We have
n’t had a winter in four seasons,”
Edy said. “We go from beach to
beach,” she added.

IN THEIR trip across the U.S.
the pair has stayed - in Salvation
Army quarters, bus depots, at
homes of friends or friends-of
friends they met in Europe, and,
at last resort in unlocked car's in
parking lots.
They also have spent the night
in a museum and look forward
to lodging in a bakery for a night.
Ealing has presented no prob
lem, as they manage to obtain
free meals quite often or else
spend small amounts of the al
most-intact stake I hey left home
with,
COMPARING Americans and
Europeans they’ve met in their
travels, the girls feel “Americans

are more aware of what’s going
on in other countries and about
other people,” taut too often tend
to judge other peoples and na
tions in comparison with the
United States.

“California is the first state
where we've really felt at home,”
the girls said. They pointed out
that Californians haven’t found
anything unusual in their garb
(slacks, thongs, T-shirts) as hap
pened in other states.

They were “very impressed” by
a visit to Stanford. The “well-in
formed, well-read women” par
ticularly caught their notice.

“ON THE whole we have been
disappointed in American girls,”
Edy declaied. “They feel if they
are not married by 20 or 21 they
are old maids. They are not will
ing to go out and travel and ma
ture before they settle down,” she

stressed.
While at Stanford they visited
a fraternity and had pancakes at
Lagunita. They also bought the
first two copies of Vagabond, the
travel information booklet on sale
this week by the Stanford Over
seas Information Service section
of the UR.

“We have had people refuse to
speak to us,” beeau.se we
are from South Africa, Edy said.
However, both she and Fifi are
members of the United Party,
which opposes the strong segre
gationist stand of the South Afri
can government.
NONE THE LESS, “We never
have been treated so well as in
America,” they said. Both must
leave the country by November,
when their tourist visas expire.
Their parents are taking the
trip “amazingly well” Edy says.
Her parents say her letters arc
“like a serial” and look forward
to the regular correspondence
eagerly.

i When it's all over, Edy wants
! to write a book about the trip,
j and Fifi who has a B.A. in teach-
I ing wants to study and perhaps
’ return to the U.S.

j But that’s all in the future.
Right now their concern is get
ting to the East, back across the
country and then to the Orient.
They’ll make it, thumbhow.


“GOING OUR WAY?”
