## Rights Fight Shifts From Court to Street 
### 
The disorders in Alabama are
tragic and ominous. For they
raise questions which elsewhere
in the world have proved to be in
soluble by rational political
means.

I What has hap
pened in Alaba
ma is that into
the long contro
versy over civil
rights, which has
been waged for
a century in Con
gress, in the
c ourts, in the
press, there have
in recent times
been added di

rect actions on which human lives
are staked.
WHAT had been a movement
of gradual reform is showing un
mistakable signs of turning into
a movement of physical confron
tation with all the dire possibili
ties of reprisal and copnter-re
prisal.

Federal law is being nullified
by state laws which contradict it
and by overwhelming white sen
timent which does not recognize
it. Nullification exists by the fail
ure of the state authorities to en
force Federal law and by the ab
dication of local authorities to
mobs.

We are witnessing a non-violent
rebellion against this nullifica
tion, non-violent in that the agita
tors are unarmed and passive.
This rebellion marks a lessening
of hope and faith in the processes
of the courts, of elections, of Con
gress, and of education. It is in
fluenced, no doubt, by the demon
strations in Africa that white
domination can be ended by agi
tation and rebellion. We must
recognize the grim fact that we
have no immunity here. It would
be vain for anyone to expect that
there can be a quick and easy end
to the kind of courage and deter
mination which has been shown
in the bus rides and in the lunch
counter sit-ins. No one should ex
pect this kind of thing to disap
pear leaving everything as it was
before.

THE NATION is at the begin
ning of an experience which will
test profundly our political capa
city. We must begin, of course,
with a firm determination that
we will not surrender the problem
to the mobs. While the issue
posed by the bus riders is one of
wisdom as well as of law, there
is no doubt at all that their ride

into Birmingham and Montgom
ery was lawful.
There is no doubt that the Gov
ernor of Alabama and the local
law enforcement officers failed to
prevent mobs from depriving the
bus riders of their lawful rights.
The authority of the law must,
therefore, be vindicated, and the
attorney general has acted swift
ly and boldly to do just that.
But that is only the beginning
of the story. The administration
and the country are compelled to
face the problem of direct aciton
as a method of promoting civil
rights. This is a real and press
ing problem. For it is evident that
after the lawful rights of the bus
riders have been vindicated by
the Federal Marshals, the Federal
Government will almost certainly
be in a position where it may be
called upon to intervene when
ever and wherever someone
chooses to make a physical dem
onstration against the nullifica
tion of civil rights. The question
is what kind of precedent is to be
established by the sending of the
Federal Marshals. The matter
cannot be left at the point where
the Federal Government is in
duty bound to protect those
whose actions it cannot advise,
guide, and control.
IT FOLLOWS, so it seems to
me, that the administration will
have to have a thorough discus
sion with the leaders of the direct
action movement. It must do this
before the incipient rebellion gets
out of hand. For while agitation
cannot, and should not, be sup
pressed, it canont be left unlimit
ed and uncontrolled. If this rule
is established, it may provide a
basis on which it is not unreason
able to hope that the administra
tion can talk seriously with the
responsible leaders of the South
—talk to them about measures to
reduce and eliminate the publicly
degrading forms of segregation.

In this, as in so much of our
troubled world, the central issue
is whether the reasonable men
can collect the moral, the intel
lectual, and the physical force to
control and subdue the extremists
and the violent. The issue is very
much in doubt. For the good
rhetoric and the good tunes are
with the impatient and the pas
sionate and the violent.

But since across the genera
tions we have managed to become
at least partially civilized, we are
entitled to believe that the last
word is with reason.

the long contro
versy over civil
rights, which has
been waged for
a century in Con
gress, in the
c ourts, in the
press, there have
in recent times
been added di

rect actions on which human lives
are staked.
WHAT had been a movement
of gradual reform is showing un
mistakable signs of turning into
a movement of physical confron
tation with all the dire possibili
ties of reprisal and copnter-re
prisal.

Federal law is being nullified
by state laws which contradict it
and by overwhelming white sen
timent which does not recognize
it. Nullification exists by the fail
ure of the state authorities to en
force Federal law and by the ab
dication of local authorities to
mobs.

We are witnessing a non-violent
rebellion against this nullifica
tion, non-violent in that the agita
tors are unarmed and passive.
This rebellion marks a lessening
of hope and faith in the processes
of the courts, of elections, of Con
gress, and of education. It is in
fluenced, no doubt, by the demon
strations in Africa that white
domination can be ended by agi
tation and rebellion. We must
recognize the grim fact that we
have no immunity here. It would
be vain for anyone to expect that
there can be a quick and easy end
to the kind of courage and deter
mination which has been shown
in the bus rides and in the lunch
counter sit-ins. No one should ex
pect this kind of thing to disap
pear leaving everything as it was
before.

THE NATION is at the begin
ning of an experience which will
test profundly our political capa
city. We must begin, of course,
with a firm determination that
we will not surrender the problem
to the mobs. While the issue
posed by the bus riders is one of
wisdom as well as of law, there
is no doubt at all that their ride

into Birmingham and Montgom
ery was lawful.
There is no doubt that the Gov
ernor of Alabama and the local
law enforcement officers failed to
prevent mobs from depriving the
bus riders of their lawful rights.
The authority of the law must,
therefore, be vindicated, and the
attorney general has acted swift
ly and boldly to do just that.
But that is only the beginning
of the story. The administration
and the country are compelled to
face the problem of direct aciton
as a method of promoting civil
rights. This is a real and press
ing problem. For it is evident that
after the lawful rights of the bus
riders have been vindicated by
the Federal Marshals, the Federal
Government will almost certainly
be in a position where it may be
called upon to intervene when
ever and wherever someone
chooses to make a physical dem
onstration against the nullifica
tion of civil rights. The question
is what kind of precedent is to be
established by the sending of the
Federal Marshals. The matter
cannot be left at the point where
the Federal Government is in
duty bound to protect those
whose actions it cannot advise,
guide, and control.
IT FOLLOWS, so it seems to
me, that the administration will
have to have a thorough discus
sion with the leaders of the direct
action movement. It must do this
before the incipient rebellion gets
out of hand. For while agitation
cannot, and should not, be sup
pressed, it canont be left unlimit
ed and uncontrolled. If this rule
is established, it may provide a
basis on which it is not unreason
able to hope that the administra
tion can talk seriously with the
responsible leaders of the South
—talk to them about measures to
reduce and eliminate the publicly
degrading forms of segregation.

In this, as in so much of our
troubled world, the central issue
is whether the reasonable men
can collect the moral, the intel
lectual, and the physical force to
control and subdue the extremists
and the violent. The issue is very
much in doubt. For the good
rhetoric and the good tunes are
with the impatient and the pas
sionate and the violent.

But since across the genera
tions we have managed to become
at least partially civilized, we are
entitled to believe that the last
word is with reason.

mistakable signs of turning into

prisal.

Federal law is being nullified

attorney general has acted swift

of the story. The administration
and the country are compelled to
face the problem of direct aciton
as a method of promoting civil
rights. This is a real and press

after the lawful rights of the bus
riders have been vindicated by
the Federal Marshals, the Federal
Government will almost certainly
be in a position where it may be
called upon to intervene when
ever and wherever someone
chooses to make a physical dem
onstration against the nullifica
tion of civil rights. The question
is what kind of precedent is to be
established by the sending of the
Federal Marshals. The matter
cannot be left at the point where
the Federal Government is in
duty bound to protect those
whose actions it cannot advise,
guide, and control.
IT FOLLOWS, so it seems to
me, that the administration will
have to have a thorough discus
sion with the leaders of the direct
action movement. It must do this
before the incipient rebellion gets
out of hand. For while agitation
cannot, and should not, be sup
pressed, it canont be left unlimit
ed and uncontrolled. If this rule
is established, it may provide a
basis on which it is not unreason
able to hope that the administra
tion can talk seriously with the
responsible leaders of the South
—talk to them about measures to
reduce and eliminate the publicly
degrading forms of segregation.

In this, as in so much of our
troubled world, the central issue
is whether the reasonable men
can collect the moral, the intel
lectual, and the physical force to
control and subdue the extremists
and the violent. The issue is very
much in doubt. For the good
rhetoric and the good tunes are
with the impatient and the pas
sionate and the violent.

But since across the genera
tions we have managed to become
at least partially civilized, we are
entitled to believe that the last
word is with reason.

The disorders in Alabama are
tragic and ominous. For they
raise questions which elsewhere
in the world have proved to be in
soluble by rational political
means.

I What has hap
pened in Alaba
ma is that into
the long contro
versy over civil
rights, which has
been waged for
a century in Con
gress, in the

press, there have
in recent times
been added di

are staked.
