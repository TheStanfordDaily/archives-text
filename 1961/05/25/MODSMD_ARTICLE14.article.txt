Some of your student readers
have asked for a letter from me
on the subject of Chappie’s par
ody of Playboy Magazine and the
penalties visited upon the Old Boy
and his staff.
As a member of the President’s
Committee on Student Affairs, I
was one of those consulted by
Dean Winbigler before he acted.
Furthermore, for the past three
years I have had charge of the
program planning for 40 alumni
conferences in some fifteen cities.
Inevitably, I have gained familiar
ity with the thinking respecting
public relations in the President’s
Office, the Development Office,
the Alumni Office and other Uni
versity areas sensitive to those
relations.
None of these connections will,
I think, detract from my credibil
ity in the present case at least in
the eyes of the great numbers of
your student readers with whom
I have always dealt in undiplo
matic candor.

But I will confine myself to the
question of motivation since that
has become the critical question.
On this point, a little good sense
and good will should have reas
sured your doubtful readers but
apparently significant numbers
have not been reassured.
These believe that what moved
Doan Winbigler to impose his pen
alties and what dictated their se
verity was a timid regard for the
evigencies of the $100,000,000
PACE drive. By wounding the
sensibilities of wide sections of
the adult (and substantial!) pub
lic, the Chappie parody under
mined the University’s appeal for
support, which must be retrieved
by vigorous and punitive action.
Such appears to be the logic of
Dean Winbigler’s critics.
Such logic leaves out the Uni
versity’s obligation to the Univer
sity community, including the stu
dents, to its friends and well
wishers beyond the confines of
the campus, and to society at
large. I do not wish here to argue
the case for higher rather than
lower standards in conduct, taste
and style. I do not wish to argue

the propriety of the penalties im
posed this time to insure that next,
time a different judgment will
govern.

I do wish to assert that consid
erations of propriety, not consid
erations of expediency, led to the
suspension of the Chaparal and
of Mr. Efron and to the proba
tionary status of his associates.
No thought whatever was given
to PACE or to pressures from in
terested outsiders.
Indeed had such extraneous
considerations been allowed to en
ter the picture they would on bal
ance have counseled milder action
by the Dean’s office. It is this
point more than any other that
moves me to write a letter. For
your readers should be able to
perceive that the conjunction of
PACE and the Chappie penalties
have deprived the former of stu
dent interest and enthusiasm.
What student will look with pride
upon a four-year University ef
fort however exciting in itself if
that student believes that student
initiative is to remain stultified
during those four years?
Again, I hope that good sense
and good will can prevail. For
what is more central to the Uni
versity’s purpose than the culti
vation of creativity, imagination
and initiative in the Stanford stu
dent? Who upon reflection can
really hold to the belief that the
University would tolerate for
whatever reason four months, let
alone four years, in which student
initiative is to be repressed?
During the past year at fifteen
alumni conferences I have seen
the unmatched effectiveness
which students bring to telling
the Stanford story. As one who
loves the University and makes
no bones about it, I am eager to
see students enlisted in PACE. I
decry anything obstructing that
commitment as injuring Stanford.
Out of respect for student opin
ion but also out of loyalty to the
institution which brought us to
gether in the first place and now
inspires the PACE drive, I have
acceded to the request for this
letter.

Some of your student readers
have asked for a letter from me
on the subject of Chappie’s par
ody of Playboy Magazine and the
penalties visited upon the Old Boy
and his staff.
As a member of the President’s
Committee on Student Affairs, I
was one of those consulted by
Dean Winbigler before he acted.
Furthermore, for the past three
years I have had charge of the
program planning for 40 alumni
conferences in some fifteen cities.
Inevitably, I have gained familiar
ity with the thinking respecting
public relations in the President’s
Office, the Development Office,
the Alumni Office and other Uni
versity areas sensitive to those
relations.
None of these connections will,
I think, detract from my credibil
ity in the present case at least in
the eyes of the great numbers of
your student readers with whom
I have always dealt in undiplo
matic candor.

But I will confine myself to the
question of motivation since that
has become the critical question.
On this point, a little good sense
and good will should have reas
sured your doubtful readers but
apparently significant numbers
have not been reassured.
These believe that what moved
Doan Winbigler to impose his pen
alties and what dictated their se
verity was a timid regard for the
evigencies of the $100,000,000
PACE drive. By wounding the
sensibilities of wide sections of
the adult (and substantial!) pub
lic, the Chappie parody under
mined the University’s appeal for
support, which must be retrieved
by vigorous and punitive action.
Such appears to be the logic of
Dean Winbigler’s critics.
Such logic leaves out the Uni
versity’s obligation to the Univer
sity community, including the stu
dents, to its friends and well
wishers beyond the confines of
the campus, and to society at
large. I do not wish here to argue
the case for higher rather than
lower standards in conduct, taste
and style. I do not wish to argue

the propriety of the penalties im
posed this time to insure that next,
time a different judgment will
govern.

I do wish to assert that consid
erations of propriety, not consid
erations of expediency, led to the
suspension of the Chaparal and
of Mr. Efron and to the proba
tionary status of his associates.
No thought whatever was given
to PACE or to pressures from in
terested outsiders.
Indeed had such extraneous
considerations been allowed to en
ter the picture they would on bal
ance have counseled milder action
by the Dean’s office. It is this
point more than any other that
moves me to write a letter. For
your readers should be able to
perceive that the conjunction of
PACE and the Chappie penalties
have deprived the former of stu
dent interest and enthusiasm.
What student will look with pride
upon a four-year University ef
fort however exciting in itself if
that student believes that student
initiative is to remain stultified
during those four years?
Again, I hope that good sense
and good will can prevail. For
what is more central to the Uni
versity’s purpose than the culti
vation of creativity, imagination
and initiative in the Stanford stu
dent? Who upon reflection can
really hold to the belief that the
University would tolerate for
whatever reason four months, let
alone four years, in which student
initiative is to be repressed?
During the past year at fifteen
alumni conferences I have seen
the unmatched effectiveness
which students bring to telling
the Stanford story. As one who
loves the University and makes
no bones about it, I am eager to
see students enlisted in PACE. I
decry anything obstructing that
commitment as injuring Stanford.
Out of respect for student opin
ion but also out of loyalty to the
institution which brought us to

the unmatched effectiveness
which students bring to telling
the Stanford story. As one who
loves the University and makes
no bones about it, I am eager to
see students enlisted in PACE. I
decry anything obstructing that
commitment as injuring Stanford.
Out of respect for student opin
ion but also out of loyalty to the
institution which brought us to
gether in the first place and now
inspires the PACE drive, I have
acceded to the request for this
letter.
