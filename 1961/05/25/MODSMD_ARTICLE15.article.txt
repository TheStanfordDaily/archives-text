# Classes in Religion Respected?
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
“In the last 10 years religion
has become intellectually exciting
and academically respectably,”
Dr. Will Herberg said at Stanford
last month.
Herberg spoke from his experi
ence as a professor and lecturer
at East Coast Universities. Would
he have said this if he knew Stan
ford well?
THE BOOK of Courses and De
grees seems to say that he would.
Just 15 years ago there was no
department of religion, before
Chaplain Elton Trueblood came
to Stanford.
IN 1936-37 Trueblood taught
one two-unit course. Four years
later, the religion department of
fered 10 courses, only to go back
down to just three courses when
Trueblood left in 1948. During
the coming academic year, 20 re
ligion courses will be offered.
Statistics, however, mean very
little. It would be better to deter
mine why more courses are of
fered, what is being taught, and
who is learning.
ALTHOUGH they agree that
there is increased religious inter
est at Stanford, the religion pro
fessors disagree about the rea
sons for it. Dr. Edwin M. Good
ascribed it to more vigorous the
ology, Dr. H. Jackson Forstman
to more thoughtful teaching, and
Dr. Frederic Spiegleberg to the
beatnik movement.
TO EXPRESS this difference
in their words, Good says “people
want to tackle stiff theological
ideas,” Forstman says “religious
teaching used to be more learn
ing and less understanding,” and
Spiegleberg says “the beatnik
movement has done a great deal
from the outside to revive
churches.”
There has always been a debate
in academic circles as to whether
religious instruction should con
centrate on criticism or convic
tion.

SINCE World War 11, the in
fluence of scientific analysis and
intellectual objectivity has made
religious courses emphasize criti
cism.

THIS IS TRUE at Stanford.
As Good says, “The idea behind
the department of religion was
not to train specialists, but to
offer the basic materials for the
understanding of religion.”

Forstman agrees. “We reject
the idea of trying to make the
classroom an evangelism situa
tion,” he stated. “We try to han
dle documents of the faith criti
cally and openly.”
SPIEGLEBEBG’S Comparative
Religion class is more than just
criticism and fact. Perhaps this
is because his religion transcends
the limits of Christianity, thus
allowing him to express his con
victions without being hindered
by popular prejudices against
Christianity.
The administration does not
make any more attempt to con
trol the religion department than
it does to control any other aca
demic department of the Univer
sity.

THE CONNECTION between
Memorial Church and the religion
department is one of friendly co
operation, not one- of control.
Good and Forstman speak in Me
morial Church each year, and
Chaplain Minto occasionally
teaches a class.

Spiegleberg believes that “in
ter denominationalism is one of
the best aspects of Memorial
Church.”

THIS STATEMENT brings to
mind the student idea that Hindu
and Moslem speakers shm 1 be
invited to speak in the Memorial
Church service. Chaplain Minto’s
answer to this request is “It's not
a matter of written policy, it’s a
matter of appropriateness.”
Who takes religion classes?
According to all three religion
professors, almost every kind of
student in every major field.
Some are curious, some are con
fused, some are committed.

“In the last 10 years religion
has become intellectually exciting
and academically respectably,”
Dr. Will Herberg said at Stanford
last month.
Herberg spoke from his experi
ence as a professor and lecturer
at East Coast Universities. Would
he have said this if he knew Stan
ford well?
THE BOOK of Courses and De
grees seems to say that he would.
Just 15 years ago there was no
department of religion, before
Chaplain Elton Trueblood came
to Stanford.
IN 1936-37 Trueblood taught
one two-unit course. Four years
later, the religion department of
fered 10 courses, only to go back
down to just three courses when
Trueblood left in 1948. During
the coming academic year, 20 re
ligion courses will be offered.
Statistics, however, mean very
little. It would be better to deter
mine why more courses are of
fered, what is being taught, and
who is learning.
ALTHOUGH they agree that
there is increased religious inter
est at Stanford, the religion pro
fessors disagree about the rea
sons for it. Dr. Edwin M. Good
ascribed it to more vigorous the
ology, Dr. H. Jackson Forstman
to more thoughtful teaching, and
Dr. Frederic Spiegleberg to the
beatnik movement.
TO EXPRESS this difference
in their words, Good says “people
want to tackle stiff theological
ideas,” Forstman says “religious
teaching used to be more learn
ing and less understanding,” and
Spiegleberg says “the beatnik
movement has done a great deal
from the outside to revive
churches.”
There has always been a debate
in academic circles as to whether
religious instruction should con
centrate on criticism or convic
tion.

SINCE World War 11, the in
fluence of scientific analysis and
intellectual objectivity has made
religious courses emphasize criti
cism.

THIS IS TRUE at Stanford.
As Good says, “The idea behind
the department of religion was
not to train specialists, but to
offer the basic materials for the
understanding of religion.”

Forstman agrees. “We reject
the idea of trying to make the
classroom an evangelism situa
tion,” he stated. “We try to han
dle documents of the faith criti
cally and openly.”
SPIEGLEBEBG’S Comparative
Religion class is more than just
criticism and fact. Perhaps this
is because his religion transcends
the limits of Christianity, thus
allowing him to express his con
victions without being hindered
by popular prejudices against
Christianity.
The administration does not
make any more attempt to con
trol the religion department than
it does to control any other aca
demic department of the Univer
sity.

THE CONNECTION between
Memorial Church and the religion
department is one of friendly co
operation, not one- of control.
Good and Forstman speak in Me
morial Church each year, and
Chaplain Minto occasionally
teaches a class.

Spiegleberg believes that “in
ter denominationalism is one of
the best aspects of Memorial
Church.”

THIS STATEMENT brings to
mind the student idea that Hindu
and Moslem speakers shm 1 be
invited to speak in the Memorial
Church service. Chaplain Minto’s
answer to this request is “It's not
a matter of written policy, it’s a
matter of appropriateness.”
Who takes religion classes?
According to all three religion
professors, almost every kind of
student in every major field.
