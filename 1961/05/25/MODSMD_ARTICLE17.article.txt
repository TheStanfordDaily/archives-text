# Finishing Kick

The wave of basketball scandals which has been spread over the
front pages of eastern newspapers recently touched close to home
when the Dixie Classic, a holiday invitational tournament, was can
celled this week. Coach Howie Dallmar’s Stanford quintet was
scheduled to play in this, the oldest and largest of the winter tour
naments, against two of the delinquent schools, North Carolina and
North Carolina Slate.
For the Cards it means a void in their rather packed and varied
schedule which may be filled in a variety of ways. It will also hurt
financially, for the $11,000 or $12,000 cut of each competing school
will now have to be made up elsewhere.
BUT THKSK problems seem rather small as compaied to the fate
that faces North Carolina and North Carolina State. For years two
of the leading basketball powers in the nation and expected to he
among the leaders again next year, these two schools were faced
with the option of dropping intercollegiate athletics-completely or
submitting to a stiff set of regulations which will in the end spell
de-emphasis and a second-rate basketball program. These are the
facts, now let’s look behind them just a bit.
Raleigh, North Carolina, the state capital and a city with a
prominent historical flavor. It’s main product the finest in college
basketball. The city's loyalty is split among four of the strongest
hoop schools in the nation—Wake Forest, Duke, North Carolina,
and North Carolina State--all within 40 miles of each other.
Competition during the season is waged in the spacious pavilions
on each campus, but in the off months it takes place in high school
locker rooms, on the phone, or on extended recruiting trips out of
the state. The stakes are high, for basketball is a lucrative business
in the Raleigh area. The Dixie Classic, in which all four teams
compete, draws upwards of 85,000 every year, which means big
dividends for the host schools.
THIS STIFF 1 competition has brought the best in college basket
ball to the southern metropolis and has enabled many athletes to
obtain a college education. But it has also brought unethical recruit
ing practices, under-the-table handouts, and finally the gambling
fiasco just recently revealed. The answer, as outlined by chancellors
of the two colleges, lies clearly in one of the two alternatives men
tioned above. In our estimation the better one was chosen.
Beginning next year the two universities will adopt the following
restrictions:
• Restrict recruiting of players from outside the Atlantic Coast
Conference area to two per year for each school.
• Restrict the basketball schedule to two non-conference games
and ban participation in all tournaments except the ACC Champion
ship and the NCAA playoffs.
• Abolish the Dixie Classic.
• Bar any basketball player from playing in organized summer
league competition.
• Continue the athletic grant-in-aid program.
These measures do not spell the end of big-time basketball on the
two campuses. As Dallmar points out, “They must cut back and
try to figure out where they went wrong. Basketball has grown so
last that it is difficult for officials and such to keep up with it. I
think they’ll slowly build up again and try to avoid the pitfalls they
hit in the first place.”
MF.ANWHIUK the bold headlines and court investigations are
taking their toll on the game. Thinking along these lines, we can’t
help recalling an item in Mentor Magazine a few years ago. It
appeared under the by-line of a promising young coach at Occidental
College, Payton Jordan.
His introduction read something like this. “Sports are as Ameri-
as ham an’ eggs, but for me they should be served sunny side
up Talk of de-emphasizing football, misallocation of funds, and
under-the-table payments to athletes always appears higher on the
u tld * n bolder type than the Chuck Taylors and Rafer Johnsons
who have made successes of their lives because they were able to
get a college education through athletics. And why? Simply because
these negative elements are the rare exception.

Competition during the season is waged in the spacious pavilions
on each campus, but in the off months it takes place in high school
locker rooms, on the phone, or on extended recruiting trips out of
the state. The stakes are high, for basketball is a lucrative business
in the Raleigh area. The Dixie Classic, in which all four teams
compete, draws upwards of 85,000 every year, which means big
dividends for the host schools.
THIS STIFF 1 competition has brought the best in college basket
ball to the southern metropolis and has enabled many athletes to
obtain a college education. But it has also brought unethical recruit
ing practices, under-the-table handouts, and finally the gambling
fiasco just recently revealed. The answer, as outlined by chancellors
of the two colleges, lies clearly in one of the two alternatives men
tioned above. In our estimation the better one was chosen.
Beginning next year the two universities will adopt the following
restrictions:
• Restrict recruiting of players from outside the Atlantic Coast
Conference area to two per year for each school.
• Restrict the basketball schedule to two non-conference games
and ban participation in all tournaments except the ACC Champion
ship and the NCAA playoffs.
• Abolish the Dixie Classic.
• Bar any basketball player from playing in organized summer
league competition.
• Continue the athletic grant-in-aid program.
These measures do not spell the end of big-time basketball on the
two campuses. As Dallmar points out, “They must cut back and
try to figure out where they went wrong. Basketball has grown so
last that it is difficult for officials and such to keep up with it. I
think they’ll slowly build up again and try to avoid the pitfalls they
hit in the first place.”

taking their toll on the game. Thinking along these lines, we can’t

appeared under the by-line of a promising young coach at Occidental
College, Payton Jordan.
His introduction read something like this. “Sports are as Ameri-
as ham an’ eggs, but for me they should be served sunny side
up Talk of de-emphasizing football, misallocation of funds, and
under-the-table payments to athletes always appears higher on the

get a college education through athletics. And why? Simply because
these negative elements are the rare exception.

The wave of basketball scandals which has been spread over the
front pages of eastern newspapers recently touched close to home
when the Dixie Classic, a holiday invitational tournament, was can
celled this week. Coach Howie Dallmar’s Stanford quintet was
scheduled to play in this, the oldest and largest of the winter tour
naments, against two of the delinquent schools, North Carolina and
North Carolina Slate.
For the Cards it means a void in their rather packed and varied
schedule which may be filled in a variety of ways. It will also hurt
financially, for the $11,000 or $12,000 cut of each competing school
will now have to be made up elsewhere.
BUT THKSK problems seem rather small as compaied to the fate
that faces North Carolina and North Carolina State. For years two
of the leading basketball powers in the nation and expected to he
among the leaders again next year, these two schools were faced
with the option of dropping intercollegiate athletics-completely or
submitting to a stiff set of regulations which will in the end spell
de-emphasis and a second-rate basketball program. These are the
facts, now let’s look behind them just a bit.
