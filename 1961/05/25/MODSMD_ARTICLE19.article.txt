# SC CINDERMEN FAVORED
## AAWU Championships Billed 
### 
There will b'o little suspense
about the final outcome, hut
there could lie records aplenty as
the Washington, Cal, USC, UCLA
and Stanford cinder squads gath
er at Stanford Stadium Saturday
for the AAWU track and field
championships.
FIELD EVENT trials will get
underway at 12 o’clock on Satur
day with the first track event fol
lowing half an hour later, and
finals will begin a’ 5 o’clock the
same afternoon.
Southern Cal, undefeated in
dual meets this season, is an

overwhelming favorite to retain
its 1960 title while the UCLA
squad is a strong contender for
second place. The big battle will
be among the Bears, the Huskies
and Cards for third as all three
contingents are rated almost
even.

New league records may be set
in every event as Big Five ath
letes have bettered existing stand
aids in every event except the
mile in dual competition this sea
son.

LEADING the way are the SC
runners ami field event stars who

hold (ho best marks in the league,
and at the same time have broken
last year’s records,-in 11 of the 16
events to he held in Saturday’s
meet.

Trojan dash man Rex Cawley
heads the list of individual stand
outs as he has covered the 440 in
46.2 this season, well under the
league mark of 47.3 set by Jack
Yerman in '6O, and has skimmed

the 220 low barriers in 22.5, which
will shatter the old lime of 23.7
set by his teammate Bobby Staten
last year if the Los Angeles speed
ster can duplicate his feat Satur
day,
DALLAS LONG, Southern Cal
shot putter, is probably the surest
bet to put a new record in the
books as he has consistently been
beyond the existing distance of
■ 61-3% that he set last year.
Long’s best of the current season
■ is a put of 64-3 Va.
i Charlie Dumas’s high jump
i record of 6-8% also may be in
• danger as another SC trackman,
senior Bob Avant. has cleared 7-0.
