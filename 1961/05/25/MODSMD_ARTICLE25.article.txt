The senior class plans a one

night.
“Ready Sot Zoom! a Roadrun
ner cartoon will start at 10 p.m.'
at the Alpine Beer Gardens. Ad
mission will be 24 cents.
For an extra penny—that’s 25
cents all told patrons may stay
to see “The Frogmen,’* an MGM
feature picture starring Richard
Widmark.
It’ll be cold outside at that time
of night, said senior class flicks

blankets.’’
