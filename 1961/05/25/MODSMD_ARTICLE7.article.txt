# Sterling Sees Betas on Prank Paper Reports
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Times reported
that a pledge sneak last Tuesday
prompted President Sterling to
summon the president of Beta
Theta Pi lor questioning yester
day.
According to the Times an
anonymous letter from Tulare to
the San Mateo County sheriff’s
office tipped off the authorities.
The letter said a group of Beta
Theta Pi actives was tied all
night to a tennis court fence on
the estate of Paul Fay Sr„ father
of the under Secretary of the
Navy.

According to the anonymous re
port, one of the fraternity men
escaped, only to be run down by
his “tormentors" in a car and in
jured.
Both Fay and (lie University re
portedly denied that anyone was
hurt.

No official University report on
the incident has been obtained by
the Daily, however. Assistant to
the president Frederic O. Glover
denied knowledge of any meeting
between President Sterling and
the president of Beta Theta Pi.
Dean Winbigler denied any pos
itive knowledge of facts of the
case.

According to Fay. the pledge
sneak was a “harmless, childlike
thing.” His grandson, Ward Wil
son Woods Jr. of La Jolla, got
permission in advance to use the
tennis court for the “party,” said
Fay.
Woods is a Beta Theta Pi
pledge. Fay said he granted his
grandson permission to hold the
party only when he was prom
ised there would he no rough
housing and no drinking. The
boys kept their promises, he said.
