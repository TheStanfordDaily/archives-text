# 'Freedom Riders’ Arrested In Miss.
## 27 Whites and Negroes Defy Racial Barriers 
### 
JACKSON, Miss. ~(UPI)—-Twenty-seven white and Negro "Free
dom Riders, shielded by National Guard bayonets, invaded the
hard-core heartland of Southern racial segregation yesterday and
were promptly arrested.
The avowed purpose of the "Freedom Riders" was openly to

defy all segregation barriers con
nected with travel on the high
ways, Their publicized arrival last
weekend in Montgomery, Ala,,
touched off raw violence that re
sulted in martial law and the dis
patch of hundreds of U.S. mar
shals.
This was the first of what
Negro leaders vowed would be a
continued attack on all forms of
racial segregation in the deep
South —in Alabama. Mississippi,
Louisiana, South Carolina, and
Georgia.
There was no violence today.
But highway patrolmen, helicop
ters, National Guard bayonets
and local police kept sullen
crowds away from the two red,
silver and white Trailways buses
that sped the “Freedom Riders"
250 miles from the capital of Ala
bama to the capital of Mississippi.
The first bus took four rest
stops in Alabama. Once it crossed
the Mississippi lino, however, it
hit speeds up to 90 miles an hour
on the straight highway to the
hot, white-columned city of Jack
son on the Pearl River.
The 11 Negroes and one white
man on the first bus were sing
ing impromptu calypso rhythms
when the bus crossed the state
line at Cuba, Ala. It stopped in
the rain because of a rumor that
someone in the silent crowd at
the state line planned to throw
a dynamite bomb.
Just over the line, six National
Guardsmen boarded the bus. A
shirt-sleeved deputy sheriff out
side shook his fist at the faces
in the window and shouted, “You
nigger .”
The men aboard the first bus
swung down when it reached the
Jackson terminal at 12:55 p.m.
PDT. They walked into the white
restroom and were promptly ar
rested. Others in the party were
arrested in the white waiting
room.
The second bus, carrying 14
Negroes and one white man,
reached Jackson just two hours
later.
All were arrested w'hen they
w'alked into the white cafeteria.
All were charged with disor
derly conduct and refusing to
obey an officer and were held in
lieu of $l,OOO bond each. Their
cases probably will come up in
city court tomorrow.
Meanwhile in Washington,
Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy
called for a cooling off period in
the “confused and dangerous” sit
uation arising in the South out
of violence against the “freedom
riders.”
Kennedy’s plea came after a
new group of riders arrived in
Atlanta and Negro leaders said
there would be daily challenges
to Mississippi’s segregation laws.

The first bus took four rest
stops in Alabama. Once it crossed
the Mississippi lino, however, it
hit speeds up to 90 miles an hour
on the straight highway to the
hot, white-columned city of Jack
son on the Pearl River.
The 11 Negroes and one white
man on the first bus were sing
ing impromptu calypso rhythms
when the bus crossed the state
line at Cuba, Ala. It stopped in
the rain because of a rumor that
someone in the silent crowd at
the state line planned to throw
a dynamite bomb.
Just over the line, six National
Guardsmen boarded the bus. A
shirt-sleeved deputy sheriff out
side shook his fist at the faces
in the window and shouted, “You
nigger .”
The men aboard the first bus
swung down when it reached the
Jackson terminal at 12:55 p.m.
PDT. They walked into the white
restroom and were promptly ar
rested. Others in the party were
arrested in the white waiting
room.
The second bus, carrying 14
Negroes and one white man,
reached Jackson just two hours
later.
All were arrested w'hen they
w'alked into the white cafeteria.
All were charged with disor
derly conduct and refusing to
obey an officer and were held in
lieu of $l,OOO bond each. Their
cases probably will come up in
city court tomorrow.
Meanwhile in Washington,
Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy
called for a cooling off period in
the “confused and dangerous” sit
uation arising in the South out
of violence against the “freedom
riders.”
Kennedy’s plea came after a
new group of riders arrived in
Atlanta and Negro leaders said
there would be daily challenges
to Mississippi’s segregation laws.
JACKSON, Miss. ~(UPI)—-Twenty-seven white and Negro "Free
dom Riders, shielded by National Guard bayonets, invaded the
hard-core heartland of Southern racial segregation yesterday and
were promptly arrested.
The avowed purpose of the "Freedom Riders" was openly to

defy all segregation barriers con
nected with travel on the high
ways, Their publicized arrival last
weekend in Montgomery, Ala,,
touched off raw violence that re
sulted in martial law and the dis
patch of hundreds of U.S. mar
shals.
This was the first of what
Negro leaders vowed would be a
continued attack on all forms of
racial segregation in the deep
South —in Alabama. Mississippi,
Louisiana, South Carolina, and
Georgia.
There was no violence today.
But highway patrolmen, helicop
ters, National Guard bayonets
and local police kept sullen
crowds away from the two red,
silver and white Trailways buses
that sped the “Freedom Riders"
250 miles from the capital of Ala
bama to the capital of Mississippi.
