"GIVE A MAN A TOUGH JOB AND A CHANCE TO GO SOMEWHERE
...AND HE’LL BREAK HIS NECK TO DO IT”
In 1958 when Bill Ebben was only a few months
away from his engineering degree at the University
of Detroit, he was in touch with 15 prospective
employers.
He chose the Michigan Bell Telephone Com
pany because: “This company offered the kind of
engineering management opportunity I wanted—
and they weren’t kidding.”
One of Bill’s first assignments was a survey of
Michigan Bell’s big Central District to find out
how long available building space could accom
modate the switching equipment required by rapid
telephone growth. “1 wasn’t given any instruc
tion,” Bill says, “I was just told to do the job.”
So Bill did it. His report became the guide for
planning and budgeting future construction.
On his next move, Bill proved he could handle
supervisory responsibility. He was sent to head up
a group of seven engineers to design a new long
distance switching center for Saginaw, Michigan
—a $4,000,000 engineering project.
Today, Bill is on the staff of Michigan Bell’s
Program Engineer. He’s working on a system for
mechanized control of telephone construction costs.
How does Bill feel about his job? “Give a man
a tough job and a chance to go somewhere—and
he’ll bieak his neck to do it. Of course, I don’t
think I’m going to be running the business next
year—but I'm getting every opportunity to hit the
top. You don’t worry about opportunity here—you
worry about whether you’re as big as the job.”
If you’re a man like Bill Ebben, a man who can
size up a job, figure out what needs to be done, and
then do it—then you should get in touch with one of
the Bell Companies. Visit your Placement Office for
literature and additional information.
“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intelli
gent, positive and imaginative men we
can possibly find.”. _
