# Awaited Son Of Spring Sing Makes Debut
## 
### 
The Sunday night flicks have
been cancelled for the week-late
running of Spring Sing, which,
under the devised title of “Sing
ing in the Rain, Act Two of ‘A
Young Man’s Fancy’ ”, starts at
7:30 Sunday night in Frost Am
phitheater.

The jazz show which was sched
uled for Frost Amphitheater Sun
day night will not be held either,
although planners of the show
hope to present it next fall.
“Son of Spring Sing” promises
to bo an even greater success
than its anonymous and ill-fated
predecessor, for although the
show is exactly the same as origi
nally planned, the extra week of
practice has produced super-ex
ceptional talent.
The lighting and stage back
drops from “Peer Gynt” are still
to be used, and the list of judges
vs the same, although KEWB's
Gary Owens has been transferred
to L.A. and will not bo able to see
the show.

It is requested by the Spring
Sing committee that the perform
ers arrive at Frost Amphitheater
by 6:30 Sunday evening.
