# Fijis Must Accept Alumni Leadership Or Be Disbanded
## 
### 
In the wake of a tar and feath
ering pledge prank, the Univer
sity last night suspended 14 fresh
man pledges of Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity and gave the fraternity
one week to organize a plan for

its alumni to take the fraternity
into a “receivership.”
If the alumni plan is not forth
coming, Doan of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler said the fraternity
will be dissolved.

Men’s Council took action
against the 14 freshmen last night
by suspending seven for spring
and summer quarters. They gave
the remaining seven suspended
suspensions until next spring
quarter.
WINBIGLEK said the suspend
ed suspension will place the
freshmen on probation for that
time. Ho noted that the seven
who were suspended had previ
ous Freshman Men’s Council rec
ords for “disorderly conduct.”
The Interfraternity Council
Board official action, released late
last night, stated “that the na
tional officers of Phi Gamma Del
ta and the alumni of the Stanford
Chapter be requested to submit
within one week a proposal for a
receivership or other plans for
assuring an acceptable basis of
operation of the Stanford Univer
sity chapter and that if such a
plan is not submitted and accept
ed the Stanford chapter be dis
solved.”
THE Interfraternity Board,
whose action was accepted by
Winbigler, is composed of the In
terfraternity Council officers,
three student IFC members and
five faculty members including
Dean of Men William G. Craig
and Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Philip Rhinelander.
IFC President Swede Pierson
said the Board expects the Fijis to
bring forth a plan such as that
under which Sigma Nu alumni
took control of that house last
year. The Sigma Nu plan gave
the alumni full power to veto any
action of the house or its officers
and authority to initiate action
for the house.
The decision to require such a
receivership for the Fijis came,
said Pierson, not only as a result
of the kidnapping, feathering and
painting last weekend of Fiji ac
tive Don Peterson as part of a
pledge sneak but also because of
past events in the fraternity’s his
tory which have shown the group
to be incapable of functioning
without serious, responsible ad
vice.
EARLIER in the week, the In
terfraternity Judicial Council, a
group subordinate to the Inter
fraternity Board, decided to as
sign the house work projects and
the men involved in the pledge
sneak substantial amounts of Con
Home work hours.
HE FEELS that “the Fiji offi
cers are trying” to ameliorate
this. The pledge action was “not
their failure, but rather the spon
taneous reaction of pledge groups
throughout the fraternity sys
tem.” ho said. “The Fiji pledges
were encouraged from their own
element rather than from the fra
ternity.”
Commenting on possible action
by any interfraternity group on
the activities of Beta Theat Pi
pledges last w'eek, which were re
ported in yesterday’s Daily and
confirmed by Dean of Men Wil
liam G. Craig, Pierson said the
occurences w'ere “not significant
enough to receive any action.”
