# QUORUM?
## LASSU OKs Poli Union Officers--Walkout Staged 
### JERRY RANKIN 
Legislature last night approved the controversial election of next
year's Political Union officers despite a walkout by two legislators
who charged the move "smelled of railroading" and would "wreck
the Union."
Gaining LASSU's okay were Lawrie Chickering, elected Poll

Union president at the governing
board’s May 18 meeting; Jim
Rogers, vice president; and Mike
Mills, also a vice president.

Just before LASSU took its ac
tion, Stern representative Charles
Lofgren and Off-Campus rep
Tom Reilly staged a walkout in
an effort to force postponement
for lack of a quorum.

BUT THERE was no official
call to ask if a quorum was pres
ent, and Legislature went ahead
and approved the officers, with
Lofgren and Reilly standing out
side Bowman smoking and talk
ing.

When they hoard the new offi
cers had been approved, they
charged “railroading” on current
president Scotty Thompson’s part,
said the new slate of officers
would “wreck” Political Union,
and left.

Earlier, however, LASSU had
listened to arguments for and
against the procedure in the elec
tion of the officers. Current sec
ond vice president Mike Norton
questioned the eligibility of some
of the board members who voted,
and also said not enough advance
warning of the election had been
given.

He urged the calling of a new
election for June 1.
Several LASSU members as
serted that the objections to the
election did not warrant the call
ing of a new one. Elections Com
mission Elna Rodenhouse report
ed that she had overseen the
election and that it had her ap
proval as far as actual balloting
went.

Lofgren moved that LASSU re
fer the matter to a committee for
study, but that was defeated. He
and Reilly then walked out, and
LASSU went ahead and okayed
the now officers.
ANY more action on the mat
ter will have to come up at next
Thursday’s LASSU meeting—the
last one of the quarter.

In other matters. LASSU de
feated a proposal to put on next
fall's ballot a constitutional
amendment which would have, if
passed by two-thirds of the voters,
placed two sophomore representa
tives on LASSU.

In other matters. LASSU de
feated a proposal to put on next
fall's ballot a constitutional
amendment which would have, if
passed by two-thirds of the voters,
placed two sophomore representa
tives on LASSU.
Legislature last night approved the controversial election of next
year's Political Union officers despite a walkout by two legislators
who charged the move "smelled of railroading" and would "wreck
the Union."
Gaining LASSU's okay were Lawrie Chickering, elected Poll

Union president at the governing
board’s May 18 meeting; Jim
Rogers, vice president; and Mike
Mills, also a vice president.

Just before LASSU took its ac
tion, Stern representative Charles
Lofgren and Off-Campus rep
Tom Reilly staged a walkout in
an effort to force postponement
for lack of a quorum.

BUT THERE was no official
call to ask if a quorum was pres
ent, and Legislature went ahead
and approved the officers, with
Lofgren and Reilly standing out
side Bowman smoking and talk
ing.

When they hoard the new offi
cers had been approved, they
charged “railroading” on current
president Scotty Thompson’s part,
said the new slate of officers
would “wreck” Political Union,
and left.

Earlier, however, LASSU had
listened to arguments for and
against the procedure in the elec
tion of the officers. Current sec
ond vice president Mike Norton
questioned the eligibility of some
of the board members who voted,
and also said not enough advance
warning of the election had been
given.

He urged the calling of a new
election for June 1.
Several LASSU members as
serted that the objections to the
election did not warrant the call
ing of a new one. Elections Com
mission Elna Rodenhouse report
ed that she had overseen the
election and that it had her ap
proval as far as actual balloting
went.

Lofgren moved that LASSU re
fer the matter to a committee for
study, but that was defeated. He
and Reilly then walked out, and
LASSU went ahead and okayed
the now officers.
ANY more action on the mat
ter will have to come up at next
Thursday’s LASSU meeting—the
last one of the quarter.
