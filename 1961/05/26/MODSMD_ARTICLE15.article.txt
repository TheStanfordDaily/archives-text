# IFC Must Create Fraternity Policy
## 
### 
In the light of the pledge pranks of the last week, we feel like
Cassandra. We do not gloat over this "we-told-you-so" attitude, how
ever, but feel a sadness that our advice (of May 8) to ban pledge
sneaks was ignored by the Interfraternity Council â€”not because the
Council thought the advice poor, but because the Council did not
want to appear to follow the Daily's editorial. Those who articulated
this illogical view at the IFC meeting and those who remained silent
must share the blame for whatever damage has been inflicted on the
individuals, the houses, and the fraternity system.
The damage promises to be serious. Yesterday morning the
Interfratemity Board overruled the IFC Judicial Council and voted to
disband the Fijis, unless local alumni show themselves ready to
assume responsibility for the action of the house's pledges and ac
tives. This appears to have taken place, for the alumni have organ
ized in hopes of saving the chapter.
Although the Fijis have no house, the Administration has ar
ranged a bloc of rooms for them in Stanford Village. This quarter
they have begun a study table, and have improved alumni relations.
This can only be the beginning of much work, for the past record of
the house is poor. The house has been disciplined as a group twelve
times during the past five years. It played a major part in the plan
ning of the notorious Los Altos beer party. This year only six of its
freshman pledges have better than a 2.0 grade average.
Such an abysmal record points out the need for Interfratemity
Council leadership. A small group of houses generally are near the
bottom of the fraternity scholastic list. These same houses produce
a large percentage of Fundamental Standard and Honor Code viola
tions. Thus, every few years, we have an incident for which one of
these houses is disciplined severely. This punishment forces the
house to walk the straight-and-narrow for a short time, but soon the
house has returned to its former image, due either to internal pres
sure in the house or external pressure from the student body to act
its role.
We believe the IFC could prevent the Administration from tak
ing strong disciplinary action, not by trying to pull the Deans toward
a lenient sentence after the offense has occurred, but by acting before
conditions have created an environment where offenses are likely
to occur.
The IFC must take active steps to promote both scholastic and
social improvement in the ragged-end group of houses, for the cur
rent practice of picking up the pieces no matter how low the house
has fallen breeds continuing weakness at a time when strength is
needed.
So far this body has acted meekly in creating policy, but boldly
in staging IFC dances. If the IFC is to continue to be composed of
24 fraternities, it must move with boldness in policy creating, too.
