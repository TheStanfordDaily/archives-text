# Denomination Groups Begin to Work Together
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
In past years the American
spirit of competition was vigor
ously expressed in church groups
of the various denominations.
Most freshmen had the choice of
either committing themselves to
one church group or trying to
escape religion entirely.

In recent years at Stanford this
has changed. Although it still
would be hard to be an active
member of more than one group,
at least people are becoming more
aware of other denominations.

IT IS no longer as hard as it
once was for a student to work
with Memorial Church and be a
member of one of the local church
groups. It is still not as easy as
it might be for the interested
agnostic to find out what denomi
national groups are doing, with
out feeling either excluded or
caught.

One outgrowth of interdenomi
nationalism is the Stanford Ecu
menical Council which came into
existence this year. This group is
made up of members from the
seven denominations, Inter-Var
sity, and the YWCA plus repre
sentatives from Memorial Church
and Newman Club.

The purpose of the council is
to let each group know what the
other is doing, so that they can
work with each other and not
against each other. The Ecumeni
cal Council also sponsors inter
faith study, worship, and mission..
ANOTHER example of inter
faith interest is the study group
in Catholic theology taught by
Rev. Bernard Barmann. The
group, which met this year for
the first time, was attended by
several non-Catholics as well as
many Catholics. This group will
meet again next year at Newman
Club.
The YWCA has a program of
speakers from various denomina
tions at their religious affairs
lunch group each Thursday. This
is one place where religious stu
dents from various groups and
unaffiliated students compare
views on religion.
One of the most difficult parts
of religion at Stanford is to try
to determine whether the writers
and journalists of our country
are honest when they speak of
a "revival of religious interest.”
OPINIONS vary. Most Protes
tant groups speak of either in
creased quantity or quality of
religious interest. Father John
Tierney says there is “no in
creased interest, but then Catholic
participation in Newman Club
has always been at a steady high.”

Some students have wondered
why Catholic priests rarely speak
in Memorial Church. Father
Welsh, a spokesman for the San
Francisco diocese, explained to
the Daily that "ordinarily a Cath
olic priest does not speak any
where except in a Catholic
church.”
Hillel Foundation, the Jewish
group, has definite increase in
student interest to report. Their
group started last year, moved
into a bigger house this year,
and have broadened the scope of
their study and worship.
The relation between Memorial
Church and the various denomi
national groups is one in which
almost everyone who has a con
cern for campus religion is inter
ested.

The denominational chaplains
who have spoken to the Daily all
have a great deal of respect for
the work Memorial Church and
Chaplain Minto are doing.
MANY of them have sugges
tions for possible improvement in
the relationship between the two
groups. One suggested that some
of Memorial Church’s potential
for ecumenicalism is unused.

Another thought that Memorial
Church emphasized worship to
the neglect of study, another sug
gested that the University con
struct a building for denomina
tional study groups and chap
lains, still another suggested that
university status be given to de
nominational chaplains.
All groups agree that they em
phasize worship and study more
than they emphasize fellowship
and parties. Many groups are
making a special effort to keep
the intellectual level of student
religion up with their intellectual
level of study at Stanford.

Hillel emphasizes “cultural ac
tivities,” more than they empha
size worship. They have classes
in Jewish philosophy, literature,
and history. One of the hopes of
this group is that university
buildings will be available for
these classes, so that more Jewish
and non-Jewish students can
attend.
The best way to summarize
ecumenical activity at Stanford
is to quote from the annual re
port of Rev. Malcolm McAfee, of
the Presbyterian Collegiate Coun
cil. “The ambiguities of the Stan
ford situation still confuses us
all. Nevertheless the day may be
rapidly approaching when we are
entitled to some clarification' of
what it means to be disciplined
agents of our denomination in
ecumenical mission,”

seven denominations, Inter-Var
sity, and the YWCA plus repre
sentatives from Memorial Church
and Newman Club.

The purpose of the council is
to let each group know what the
other is doing, so that they can
work with each other and not
against each other. The Ecumeni
cal Council also sponsors inter
faith study, worship, and mission..
ANOTHER example of inter
faith interest is the study group
in Catholic theology taught by
Rev. Bernard Barmann. The
group, which met this year for
the first time, was attended by
several non-Catholics as well as
many Catholics. This group will
meet again next year at Newman
Club.
The YWCA has a program of
speakers from various denomina
tions at their religious affairs
lunch group each Thursday. This
is one place where religious stu
dents from various groups and
unaffiliated students compare
views on religion.
One of the most difficult parts
of religion at Stanford is to try
to determine whether the writers
and journalists of our country
are honest when they speak of
a "revival of religious interest.”
OPINIONS vary. Most Protes
tant groups speak of either in
creased quantity or quality of
religious interest. Father John
Tierney says there is “no in
creased interest, but then Catholic
participation in Newman Club
has always been at a steady high.”

Some students have wondered
why Catholic priests rarely speak
in Memorial Church. Father
Welsh, a spokesman for the San
Francisco diocese, explained to
the Daily that "ordinarily a Cath
olic priest does not speak any
where except in a Catholic
church.”
Hillel Foundation, the Jewish
group, has definite increase in
student interest to report. Their
group started last year, moved
into a bigger house this year,
and have broadened the scope of
their study and worship.
The relation between Memorial
Church and the various denomi
national groups is one in which
almost everyone who has a con
cern for campus religion is inter
ested.

The denominational chaplains
who have spoken to the Daily all
have a great deal of respect for
the work Memorial Church and
Chaplain Minto are doing.
MANY of them have sugges
tions for possible improvement in
the relationship between the two
groups. One suggested that some
of Memorial Church’s potential
for ecumenicalism is unused.

Another thought that Memorial
Church emphasized worship to
the neglect of study, another sug
gested that the University con
struct a building for denomina
tional study groups and chap
lains, still another suggested that
university status be given to de
nominational chaplains.
All groups agree that they em
phasize worship and study more
than they emphasize fellowship
and parties. Many groups are
making a special effort to keep
the intellectual level of student
religion up with their intellectual
level of study at Stanford.

Hillel emphasizes “cultural ac
tivities,” more than they empha
size worship. They have classes
in Jewish philosophy, literature,
and history. One of the hopes of
this group is that university
buildings will be available for
these classes, so that more Jewish
and non-Jewish students can
attend.
The best way to summarize
ecumenical activity at Stanford
is to quote from the annual re
port of Rev. Malcolm McAfee, of
the Presbyterian Collegiate Coun
cil. “The ambiguities of the Stan
ford situation still confuses us
all. Nevertheless the day may be
rapidly approaching when we are
entitled to some clarification' of
what it means to be disciplined
agents of our denomination in
ecumenical mission,”
In past years the American
spirit of competition was vigor
ously expressed in church groups
of the various denominations.
Most freshmen had the choice of
either committing themselves to
one church group or trying to
escape religion entirely.

In recent years at Stanford this
has changed. Although it still
would be hard to be an active
member of more than one group,
at least people are becoming more
aware of other denominations.

IT IS no longer as hard as it
once was for a student to work
with Memorial Church and be a
member of one of the local church
groups. It is still not as easy as
it might be for the interested
agnostic to find out what denomi
national groups are doing, with
out feeling either excluded or
caught.

One of the most difficult parts
of religion at Stanford is to try
to determine whether the writers
and journalists of our country
are honest when they speak of
a "revival of religious interest.”
OPINIONS vary. Most Protes
tant groups speak of either in
creased quantity or quality of
religious interest. Father John
Tierney says there is “no in
creased interest, but then Catholic
participation in Newman Club
has always been at a steady high.”

Some students have wondered
why Catholic priests rarely speak
in Memorial Church. Father
Welsh, a spokesman for the San
Francisco diocese, explained to
the Daily that "ordinarily a Cath
olic priest does not speak any
where except in a Catholic
church.”
Hillel Foundation, the Jewish
group, has definite increase in
student interest to report. Their
group started last year, moved
into a bigger house this year,
and have broadened the scope of
their study and worship.
The relation between Memorial
Church and the various denomi
national groups is one in which
almost everyone who has a con
cern for campus religion is inter
ested.

The denominational chaplains
who have spoken to the Daily all
have a great deal of respect for
the work Memorial Church and
Chaplain Minto are doing.
MANY of them have sugges
tions for possible improvement in
the relationship between the two
groups. One suggested that some
of Memorial Church’s potential
for ecumenicalism is unused.

Another thought that Memorial
Church emphasized worship to
the neglect of study, another sug
gested that the University con
struct a building for denomina
tional study groups and chap
lains, still another suggested that
university status be given to de
nominational chaplains.
All groups agree that they em
phasize worship and study more
than they emphasize fellowship
and parties. Many groups are
making a special effort to keep
the intellectual level of student
religion up with their intellectual
level of study at Stanford.

Hillel emphasizes “cultural ac
tivities,” more than they empha
size worship. They have classes
in Jewish philosophy, literature,
and history. One of the hopes of
this group is that university
buildings will be available for
these classes, so that more Jewish
and non-Jewish students can
attend.
The best way to summarize
ecumenical activity at Stanford
is to quote from the annual re
port of Rev. Malcolm McAfee, of
the Presbyterian Collegiate Coun
cil. “The ambiguities of the Stan
ford situation still confuses us
all. Nevertheless the day may be
rapidly approaching when we are
entitled to some clarification' of
what it means to be disciplined
agents of our denomination in
ecumenical mission,”
In past years the American
spirit of competition was vigor
ously expressed in church groups
of the various denominations.
Most freshmen had the choice of
either committing themselves to
one church group or trying to
escape religion entirely.

In recent years at Stanford this
has changed. Although it still
would be hard to be an active
member of more than one group,
at least people are becoming more
aware of other denominations.

IT IS no longer as hard as it
once was for a student to work
with Memorial Church and be a
member of one of the local church
groups. It is still not as easy as
it might be for the interested
agnostic to find out what denomi
national groups are doing, with
out feeling either excluded or
caught.

One outgrowth of interdenomi
nationalism is the Stanford Ecu
menical Council which came into
existence this year. This group is
made up of members from the
seven denominations, Inter-Var
sity, and the YWCA plus repre
sentatives from Memorial Church
and Newman Club.

The purpose of the council is
to let each group know what the
other is doing, so that they can
work with each other and not
against each other. The Ecumeni
cal Council also sponsors inter
faith study, worship, and mission..
ANOTHER example of inter
faith interest is the study group
in Catholic theology taught by
Rev. Bernard Barmann. The
group, which met this year for
the first time, was attended by
several non-Catholics as well as
many Catholics. This group will
meet again next year at Newman
Club.
The YWCA has a program of
speakers from various denomina
tions at their religious affairs
lunch group each Thursday. This
is one place where religious stu
dents from various groups and
unaffiliated students compare
views on religion.
