CRAIG TOLD the Daily yester
day that seven Beta actives were
captured at 8 a.m. on May 16 and
tied to a wire fence on an Ather
ton estate. The actives escaped
and one of them feigned injury
in a road to attract a motorist for
a ride. Craig indicated the affair
would be considered by IFC Judi;,
cial Council. Contrary to reports
in the Palo Alto Times and other
papers, neither President Wallace
Sterling nor his office had any
contact with anyone involved.
Craig said he favored action
against the whole group involved,
the Beta house, rather than mere
action against the individuals
concerned. “These things wouldn’t
happen,” he said, “if it weren’t
for this fraternity tradition.”
