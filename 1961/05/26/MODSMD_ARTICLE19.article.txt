# Card Cindermen Hosts in Big 5 Finals
## 
### KEN DERY, Sports Editor 
It should be a spectator's delight tomorrow when USC tries to
beat back the challenge of California, Washington, UCLA and Stan
ford in the AAWU track and field championships at Stanford Sta
dium. The first field event trial will be held at 12:00 noon with the
first track trial at 12:30. The finals of the field events will begin at

5:00 p.m. with the first track
event one half hour later.
The meet should be a great
one as all of Ihe top performers
of “the nation’s toughest confer
ence" will be on hand. Just look
at the cast of characters:
DAI,LAS LONG, Southern Cal
ifornia shot putter, will be shoot
ing to establish a new stadium
shot put record in the meet’s first
field event at 5 p.m. The present
Stadium mark is 63-10 set by
Bill Nieder last year. Long, the
huge junior, won a bronze medal
in the last Olympics and has been
around 64 feel consistently this
season.
Rex Cawley. Long’s teammate,
already holds the stadium record
in the 440-yard dash. He ran a
brilliant 46.3 on a track that had
been soaked by an all-night rain
earlier in the year. Just a sopho
more, Cawley, is regarded as the
finest college quarter-miler.
And don’t sell Cawley short in
the 220 low hurdles either. He has
gone as well as 22.5, which is
more than a second faster than

the meet record of 23.7, set last
year by SC’s Bobby Staton. Stat
en is back, but he is far from the
favorite.

808 AVANT, the Trojan's top
high jumper, may become the
third man to clear seven feet in
the Stadium’s history. He leaped
7-0 just a few weeks ago.

The half mile should also be an
outstanding race. With UCLA’s
Andy Dunkell, USC's Warren
Fal low, Stanford’s Rich Klier and
Washington’s Rick Harder battl
ing it out, the fans may be treated
to the thrill of a new meet and
stadium record.

The present stadium mark is
1:48.5 set by Card Ernie Cunliffe
last year, while the meet standard
is 1:49.0 held by Cal’s Jerry Sie
bert. Dunkell ran a 1:48.9 last
weekend and Farlow did a 1 ;49.4.
Klier and Harder both have bests
close to 1:51.
THE “TIN-PLATE SPECIAL, ’’

more commonly known as the dis
cus throw, should bo perhaps the
most closely contested single
event of the day.

Last year’s Big Five champ,
Jim Wade of USC, is back, but ho
will have to come up with an out
standing performance to emerge
No. 1 in this company.

Dave Weill of Stanford has been
improving steadily from the first
week of the season, and last week
end he pushed his personal best
to a sterling 179-8.

THE REST OF the field is not
very far behind though. Gerald
Carr of UCLA has spun the plat
ter 179-3, while Jack Putnam, also
of the Bruins, has done 173-10.
Wade, who holds the NCAA mark
at 190-6' i, has heaved 177-11.
And don’t forget Stanford co
captain Don Bell. The strong guy
has thrown just under 172 feet
and might get off the launch of
his career.
Also on hand will be two 15-foot

pole vaulters —Washington’s John
Cramer and Southern California’s
Jim Brewer. Cramer has a sea-

i son’s best of 15-1%, which is an
all-time Washington record, and
has been a consistent performer
all season. Brewer has a season’s
best of 15-314 hut has been much
more inconsistent in his jumping
from meet to meet.
C. K. YANG of UCLA, probably
the world’s top decathlon per
former now that Rafer Johnson
has retired, should give all present
a real show in versatility.
Yang is tentatively entered in
four events—the high hurdles,
high jump, javelin throw and
pole vault—and on the basis of
comparative times could pick up
12 or more points for the Bruins.
Southern Cal’s crack mile relay
team might even break its own
NCAA mark of 3:07.6. set earlier
this year, if the weather holds up.
Bobby Staten, Dean Balzarett,
Kevin Hogan and Rex Cawley
comprise the team.
A THRKE-WAY duel for first
place in the broad jump should be
the situation when Stanford’s Dan
Moore and USC's Luther Hayes
and Bill Jackson meet head-on.
All have done better than 25-feet.

earlier in the year. Just a sopho
more, Cawley, is regarded as the
finest college quarter-miler.
And don’t sell Cawley short in
the 220 low hurdles either. He has
gone as well as 22.5, which is
more than a second faster than

the meet record of 23.7, set last
year by SC’s Bobby Staton. Stat
en is back, but he is far from the
favorite.

808 AVANT, the Trojan's top
high jumper, may become the
third man to clear seven feet in
the Stadium’s history. He leaped
7-0 just a few weeks ago.

The half mile should also be an
outstanding race. With UCLA’s
Andy Dunkell, USC's Warren
Fal low, Stanford’s Rich Klier and
Washington’s Rick Harder battl
ing it out, the fans may be treated
to the thrill of a new meet and
stadium record.

The present stadium mark is
1:48.5 set by Card Ernie Cunliffe
last year, while the meet standard
is 1:49.0 held by Cal’s Jerry Sie
bert. Dunkell ran a 1:48.9 last
weekend and Farlow did a 1 ;49.4.
Klier and Harder both have bests
close to 1:51.
THE “TIN-PLATE SPECIAL, ’’

more commonly known as the dis
cus throw, should bo perhaps the
most closely contested single
event of the day.

Last year’s Big Five champ,
Jim Wade of USC, is back, but ho
will have to come up with an out
standing performance to emerge
No. 1 in this company.

Dave Weill of Stanford has been
improving steadily from the first
week of the season, and last week
end he pushed his personal best
to a sterling 179-8.

THE REST OF the field is not
very far behind though. Gerald
Carr of UCLA has spun the plat
ter 179-3, while Jack Putnam, also
of the Bruins, has done 173-10.
Wade, who holds the NCAA mark
at 190-6' i, has heaved 177-11.
And don’t forget Stanford co
captain Don Bell. The strong guy
has thrown just under 172 feet
and might get off the launch of
his career.
Also on hand will be two 15-foot

pole vaulters —Washington’s John
Cramer and Southern California’s
Jim Brewer. Cramer has a sea-

i son’s best of 15-1%, which is an
all-time Washington record, and
has been a consistent performer
all season. Brewer has a season’s
best of 15-314 hut has been much
more inconsistent in his jumping
from meet to meet.
C. K. YANG of UCLA, probably
the world’s top decathlon per
former now that Rafer Johnson
has retired, should give all present
a real show in versatility.
Yang is tentatively entered in
four events—the high hurdles,
high jump, javelin throw and
pole vault—and on the basis of
comparative times could pick up
12 or more points for the Bruins.
Southern Cal’s crack mile relay
team might even break its own
NCAA mark of 3:07.6. set earlier
this year, if the weather holds up.
Bobby Staten, Dean Balzarett,
Kevin Hogan and Rex Cawley
comprise the team.
A THRKE-WAY duel for first
place in the broad jump should be
the situation when Stanford’s Dan
Moore and USC's Luther Hayes
and Bill Jackson meet head-on.
All have done better than 25-feet.

Klier and Harder both have bests
close to 1:51.
THE “TIN-PLATE SPECIAL, ’’

more commonly known as the dis
cus throw, should bo perhaps the
most closely contested single
event of the day.

Last year’s Big Five champ,
Jim Wade of USC, is back, but ho
will have to come up with an out
standing performance to emerge
No. 1 in this company.

Dave Weill of Stanford has been
improving steadily from the first
week of the season, and last week
end he pushed his personal best
to a sterling 179-8.

THE REST OF the field is not
very far behind though. Gerald
Carr of UCLA has spun the plat
ter 179-3, while Jack Putnam, also
of the Bruins, has done 173-10.
Wade, who holds the NCAA mark
at 190-6' i, has heaved 177-11.
And don’t forget Stanford co
captain Don Bell. The strong guy
has thrown just under 172 feet
and might get off the launch of
his career.
Also on hand will be two 15-foot

pole vaulters —Washington’s John
Cramer and Southern California’s
Jim Brewer. Cramer has a sea-

i son’s best of 15-1%, which is an
all-time Washington record, and
has been a consistent performer
all season. Brewer has a season’s
best of 15-314 hut has been much
more inconsistent in his jumping
from meet to meet.
C. K. YANG of UCLA, probably
the world’s top decathlon per
former now that Rafer Johnson
has retired, should give all present
a real show in versatility.
Yang is tentatively entered in
four events—the high hurdles,
high jump, javelin throw and
pole vault—and on the basis of
comparative times could pick up
12 or more points for the Bruins.
Southern Cal’s crack mile relay
team might even break its own
NCAA mark of 3:07.6. set earlier
this year, if the weather holds up.
Bobby Staten, Dean Balzarett,
Kevin Hogan and Rex Cawley
comprise the team.
A THRKE-WAY duel for first
place in the broad jump should be
the situation when Stanford’s Dan
Moore and USC's Luther Hayes
and Bill Jackson meet head-on.
All have done better than 25-feet.

Top Bruin sprinter man to beat in hundred
It should be a spectator's delight tomorrow when USC tries to
beat back the challenge of California, Washington, UCLA and Stan
ford in the AAWU track and field championships at Stanford Sta
dium. The first field event trial will be held at 12:00 noon with the
first track trial at 12:30. The finals of the field events will begin at

5:00 p.m. with the first track
event one half hour later.
The meet should be a great
one as all of Ihe top performers
of “the nation’s toughest confer
ence" will be on hand. Just look
at the cast of characters:
DAI,LAS LONG, Southern Cal
ifornia shot putter, will be shoot
ing to establish a new stadium
shot put record in the meet’s first
field event at 5 p.m. The present
Stadium mark is 63-10 set by
Bill Nieder last year. Long, the
huge junior, won a bronze medal
in the last Olympics and has been
around 64 feel consistently this
season.
Rex Cawley. Long’s teammate,
already holds the stadium record
in the 440-yard dash. He ran a
brilliant 46.3 on a track that had
been soaked by an all-night rain
earlier in the year. Just a sopho
more, Cawley, is regarded as the
finest college quarter-miler.
And don’t sell Cawley short in
the 220 low hurdles either. He has
gone as well as 22.5, which is
more than a second faster than

the meet record of 23.7, set last
year by SC’s Bobby Staton. Stat
en is back, but he is far from the
favorite.

808 AVANT, the Trojan's top
high jumper, may become the
third man to clear seven feet in
the Stadium’s history. He leaped
7-0 just a few weeks ago.

The half mile should also be an
outstanding race. With UCLA’s
Andy Dunkell, USC's Warren
Fal low, Stanford’s Rich Klier and
Washington’s Rick Harder battl
ing it out, the fans may be treated
to the thrill of a new meet and
stadium record.

The present stadium mark is
1:48.5 set by Card Ernie Cunliffe
last year, while the meet standard
is 1:49.0 held by Cal’s Jerry Sie
bert. Dunkell ran a 1:48.9 last
weekend and Farlow did a 1 ;49.4.
Klier and Harder both have bests
close to 1:51.
