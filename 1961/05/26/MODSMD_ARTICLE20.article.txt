## More Cage Scandals Expected 
### 
. NEW YORK (UPD—Ray Pap
rocky, one of the latest players
named in the college basketball
scandals, yesterday revealed that
"there’s plenty more to come.”
The New York University court
star said that during a half dozen
secret appearances before a New
York county grand jury he recog
nized “a lot of basketball play
ers” who haven’t been identified
yet in the point-shaving investi
gations.
“MAYBE SOME of them were
just called in for general ques
tioning and released,” Paprocky
said. "But I think they’re going
to involve more guys before this
thing is over.”
Paprocky was one of 14 players
from 10 colleges named yesterday
in a 18-count indictment issued by
the grand jury against Joseph
Hacken, an unemployed 41-year
old New York gambler who is ac
cused of being the "fixer” who
bribed or attempted to bribe the
players.
THOSE accused of fixing games
were Paprocky. Art Hicks and
Henry Gunter of Seton Hall Uni
versity, and Mike Parenti and Bill
Chrystal, former St. John’s Uni
versity players. Hicks and Gunter
had previously been identified
when Hackeen was arrested
March 17 with his gambler pal,
Aaron Wagman, who is awaiting
trial.
Seven other players named in
the indictment were accused of
failing to report bribe offers.
They are Tony Jackson, high
scoring St. John’s star; sopho
more ace Fred Crawford of St.
Bonaventure; Maurice Gilmore
of Colorado U., Sylvester Blye,
who played briefly at Seattle U,
Salvatore Vergopia. formerly of
Niagara U, and Alfred Saunders
and James Robinson' both of
Bradley U.
IN ADDITION, Roger Brown,
a freshman at the University of
Dayton, and Cornelius (Connie)
Hawkins, a freshman star at lowa
who has since dropped out of
school, were accused of acting as
“intermediaries” for Hacken.
Brown received $250 and Haw
kins accepted $2lO from Hacken
for introducing players to the
gambler, according to district at
torney Frank Hogan. Hacken, in
a sense, was using Brown and
Hawkins to set up a “farm sys
tem” of players he might ap
proach with future bribes, Hogan
said.
