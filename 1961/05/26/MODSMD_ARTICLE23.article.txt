# Mays Ends Tenth Year
## 
### 
CHlCAGO—Yesterday was the
tenth anniversary of Willie Mays’
entrance into the major leagues
in a Giant uniform. Willie Cele
brated it quietly by not playing
his favorite game baseball. The
Giants had an off day here.
Willie figured he wasn’t going
to play 10 more years in center
field.
“FIVE or six maybe. When you
get upto 37 or 38 years old you
can’t play centerfield. It takes a

younger follow to cover the
ground. But we’ll get one. There’ll
be lots of young fellows come
along and you can teach ’em to
play it,” he said.
“When I quit this game,” he
said, “they’ll have to carry me off
the field.”
HE CAME to the Giants May
25, 1951. Since then he has com
piled a lifetime batting average
of .317.
