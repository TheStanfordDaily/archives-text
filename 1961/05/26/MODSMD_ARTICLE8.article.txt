JUNE WILL SING
Pretty June Christy, the Red Garter Banjo Band and the
(evasive) Ray Hackett band will perform at the Senior Ball
June 15. Tickets go on sale Monday on Quad. The ball will
be at the Mark Hopkins from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., and Quintero
will take portraits. I. D.'s will be needed for those wishing
liquid refreshment.
