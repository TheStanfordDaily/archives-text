# Students Plan Group To End Discrimination
## Week's Events in South Show Need for Action 
### 
Appalled by the events of the past week including the arrest of
Rev. William S. Coffin and the treatment of the Freedom Riders,
several Stanford students have been stimulated to form an organi
zation specifically designed to deal with problems of discrimination.
The organization is the Institute on American Race Relations and

its first meeting will be held to
morrow at 4:30 in the Women's
Clubhouse, announced spokes
men Dave Cathcart and John
Howard yesterday.
“All of us have become especi
ally concerned with the national
problem of minority group rights
as a result of last week’s incidents
and arrests in the South,” said
Scotty Thompson, another mem
ber of the initial group.
“THK ARREST of Rev. Coffin,
who spoke at Stanford only last
January, brings these activities
especially close to this campus,”
Thompson said.
“Recently there have been many
sporadic eforts to work on dis
crimination. We need an organ
ization to provide stability and
permanence to these efforts,” Art
Spiegel and Elon Gilbert added,
explaining the purpose of lARR.
THE MEETING tomorrow will
be to present and expand the ten
tative program, and elect the first
officers. There will also be sign
ups for membership and for a
possible seminar on problems of
racial conflict.
The organization will be speci
fically directed at providing “an
opportunity for education in depth
on sociological, political and his
torical aspects, and concrete
problems of minority groups in
the United States,” according to
the tentative constitution.
There will be a “particular but
by no means exclusive reference
to the situation of the Negro in
the American South and in the
San Francisco Bay Area,” says
the statement of purpose.
lARR will provide means for
people of different races and na
tional backgrounds to meet. It. will
also “support by all practical
means those working for full citi
zenship for all citizens.”
The proposed lARR program
will have three phases; education;
relations with the American
South; and community service
projects.
HOPEFULLY, UNDER the first
phase will be a seminar conducted
by members of the faculty, and
including both Negro and white
students. The course “should pro
vide both a formal introduction
to the problems of racial conflict
and a foundation on which con
structive action can be based.”
In conjunction with this
phase, lARR will sponsor major
speakers for Focus, the Tuesday
Evening Series, and Sunday serv
ices. The group will also arrange
for small discussion groups in
panels and at dinner.
Under the second phase, lARR
will establish liaison with primari
ly Negro Southern institutions
dealing with segregation for an
exchange of information. Through
these contacts Negro students of
high competence will be encour
aged to apply for admission to
Stanford.
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY is
that the liaison will provide op
portunities for more integrated
groups like the one sponsored by
HR’s Afria Desk this Christmas
to tour the South and study civil
rights problems first hand.
Through the third rase, lARR
will try to provide opportunities
for students to work with the
people of predominantly Negro
areas and break down social and
legal barriers between whites qnd
minority groups.
THE GROUP proposes that stu
dents may be able to serve as
part - time assistant recreation
leaders in minority areas.
A number of faculty members
have expressed willingness to
serve on an advisory board for
the group. Among them are Drs.
Arnold Rogow, Hubert Marshall,
Wilfred Stone and David Levin.
Also Drs. John Mothershead. Otis
Pease, Gordon Wright, and San
ford Dornbush.
