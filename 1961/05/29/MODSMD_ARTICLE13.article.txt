# Reactions Vary To Attempts at Freedom Ride
## 
### 
JACKSON, Miss., (UPD—New
waves of “Freedom Riders” made
fresh assaults on bus terminal
segregation practices today. They
met expected arrest in Mississip
pi but surprisingly no resistance
in Alabama.
Apparently arriving as part of
a stepped up campaign by a new
“freedom ride” coordinating com
mittee, nine Negroes were
promptly arrested when they en
tered the White waiting room at
the Jackson Greyhound bus sta
tion. They were charged with
breach of the peace.
But abi-racial group encoun
tered no difficulty at the Trail
ways bus terminal in Montgomery
where a similar venture eight
days ago touched off violence that
brought U.S. marshals, National
Guardsmen and limited martial
law to the Alabama capital. Seven
Negroes used the White rest room
without resistance, but the rest
room for Negroes and the lunch
counter were closed.
Under the eyes of armed Ala
bama guardsmen, the seven Ne
groes and two white students pur
chased tickets and boarded a bus
for Jackson. The bus was escorted
by highway patrol cars, carrying
guardsmen, to the Mississippi
border.
