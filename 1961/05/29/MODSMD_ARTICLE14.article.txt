# Volume 139 Ends Thursday
## 
### 
The black cloud of Dead
Week, predicted by Farm me
torologists to descend this
Friday, will not pass over the
Daily Shack in its path. Daily
staffers, like other students,
refuse to be caught away
from their desks when it
comes.
The last issue of Volume
139 will, therefore, appear on
Thursday, to give staffers a
chance to batten down t{ie
hatches for the Dead Week
barrage.
