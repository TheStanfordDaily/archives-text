# U.S. Should Support Mass Guerilla Warfare
## 
### CHARLES LOFGREN 
The recent Cuban fiasco has
turned national attention towards
the consideration of some basic
issues in our protracted conflict
with the Communist world. The
most basic issue emerging—and
one often pointed to but seldom
explicitly stated—is the validity
of containment as the master
U.S. policy toward Communism.
The continuing debate shows
that the critics, while generally
accepting containment (which
has been U.S. policy since about
1948), fail to carry their position
through. Given the establishment
of a demonstrably Communist
oriented government in Cuba, a
country formerly anti-Communist
in international outlook, contain
ment calls for the eradication of
such a Communist advance.

BUT MORE IMPORTANT, Cas
tro’s Cuba shows the fatal short
comings of containment; 1) The
U.S. cannot possibly contain every
Communist advance by simply re
acting every time one is attempt
ed, and 3) containment is especi
ally unsuitable when it comes
time to counter anything but mili
tary or the most overt political
action.

All of this raises the question,
“What is containment” Basically,
it is a this-far-but-no-further poli
cy. Accordingly, Communist
moves against Korea or Berlin,
for example, have been met. More
fully, however, containment has
meant the division of the world
into two zones: the war zone, i.e.,
the West, where all the battles
are fought, and the peace zone,
i.e., the Communist world, which
is never touched in the continuing
conflict. By accepting in approxi
mate terms the 1948 status quo
as a limit for Western action, the
West gives a type of legitimacy
to the de facto Communist re
gimes. which legitimacy the Com
munists refuse to accord Western
governments. Hence, the war
zone-peace zone distinction we
respect their position, they don’t
respect ours.
From their sanctuary the Com
munists strike at the West know
ing that if thwarted in one at
tempt, they can shift the struggle
in time and space to another sec
tor in the war zone, believing all
the time that the inevitable tide of
history will bring success regard
less of the temporary ebb and
flow.

SO THE WEST wins a few, say
Korea, Berlin and Lebanon, but in
the meantime the Reds have
scored one, say North Vietnam.
How does it all balance up? For
more losses than gains, the Com
munists have come out ahead.
Who wouldn’t keep right on push
ing with odds like that?
Clearly a new American ap
proach is needed. In response, one
group looks at the realities of nu
clear war and comes up with vary

ing shades of pacificism. But just
because nuclear war is unpleasant
to consider and therefore declared
by some to be “unthinkable” does
not mean it is not a real possibili
ty. The day the “unthinkable” ap
proach becomes the dominant
national philosophy, we can be
sure the Russians will consider
nuclear war avery real possi
bility.
If 2700 years of Western Civili
zation are to be preserved, if, as
the President says, U.S. security
is the primary obligation of for
eign policy, if the real issue is
not peace but rather Western vic
tory, then it may be well to aban
don containment and head in the
other direction from the pacifists.

WHAT LIES in the other direc
tion? This; Carry a well co-ordi
nated war into the “peace zone.”
Support guerrilla operations in
Cuba and Laos, but also support
them in mainland China and
North Vietnam. Counter the Com
munists in all the Koreas which
may occur, but also take the in
itiative in '•upporting all the Hun
garys we can encourage. Wage
the war of the machine gun and
printing press. Develop a plan of
action integrating military and
paramilitary activities, foreign
aid, information programs, for
eign aid. information programs,
foreign student scholarships, ad
infinitum, all directed towards ul
timate victory. In brief, give the
Communists a taste of their own
tactics by recognizing the true
nature of the world conflict and
the geopolitical realities involved.
Such a program of action will
reverse the present situation and
put the Communists in the novel
position of frying to contain free
dom —hopefully with about the
same degree of, or less, success
than we are having in containing
communism.

The objection to such a pro
gram is going to be that the West
would be inconsistent by advanc
ing its ends with Communist tac
tics which the Communists often
make use of? Historical analysis
suggests the latter. (Anyway,
talk of inconsistency sounds
strange coming from those who
propose recognition of Red China
and her admission to the U.N.
while at the same time they
quiver in the throes of joy at men
tion of our breaking relations
with the Dominican Republic.)
Only within such a structure of
world wide activity against Com
munism can an invasion of Cuba
have any more meaning than
merely being a futile holding op
eration. If by some outside chance
this type of broad-visioned pro
gram is inaugurated, maybe even
including another invasion of
Cuba (the Marines would love it),
let’s hope it is alittle better
planned—and better covered up—
than our past attempts in the
field.

eration. If by some outside chance
this type of broad-visioned pro
gram is inaugurated, maybe even
including another invasion of
Cuba (the Marines would love it),
let’s hope it is alittle better
planned—and better covered up—
than our past attempts in the
field.
The recent Cuban fiasco has
turned national attention towards
the consideration of some basic
issues in our protracted conflict
with the Communist world. The
most basic issue emerging—and
one often pointed to but seldom
explicitly stated—is the validity
of containment as the master
U.S. policy toward Communism.
The continuing debate shows
that the critics, while generally
accepting containment (which
has been U.S. policy since about
1948), fail to carry their position
through. Given the establishment
of a demonstrably Communist
oriented government in Cuba, a
country formerly anti-Communist
in international outlook, contain
ment calls for the eradication of
such a Communist advance.

BUT MORE IMPORTANT, Cas
tro’s Cuba shows the fatal short
comings of containment; 1) The
U.S. cannot possibly contain every
Communist advance by simply re
acting every time one is attempt
ed, and 3) containment is especi
ally unsuitable when it comes
time to counter anything but mili
tary or the most overt political
action.

All of this raises the question,
“What is containment” Basically,
it is a this-far-but-no-further poli
cy. Accordingly, Communist
moves against Korea or Berlin,
for example, have been met. More
fully, however, containment has
meant the division of the world
into two zones: the war zone, i.e.,
the West, where all the battles
are fought, and the peace zone,
i.e., the Communist world, which
is never touched in the continuing
conflict. By accepting in approxi
mate terms the 1948 status quo
as a limit for Western action, the
West gives a type of legitimacy
to the de facto Communist re
gimes. which legitimacy the Com
munists refuse to accord Western
governments. Hence, the war
zone-peace zone distinction we
respect their position, they don’t
respect ours.
From their sanctuary the Com
munists strike at the West know
ing that if thwarted in one at
tempt, they can shift the struggle
in time and space to another sec
tor in the war zone, believing all
the time that the inevitable tide of
history will bring success regard
less of the temporary ebb and
flow.

SO THE WEST wins a few, say
Korea, Berlin and Lebanon, but in
the meantime the Reds have
scored one, say North Vietnam.
How does it all balance up? For
more losses than gains, the Com
munists have come out ahead.
Who wouldn’t keep right on push
ing with odds like that?
Clearly a new American ap
proach is needed. In response, one
group looks at the realities of nu
clear war and comes up with vary

ing shades of pacificism. But just
because nuclear war is unpleasant
to consider and therefore declared
by some to be “unthinkable” does
not mean it is not a real possibili
ty. The day the “unthinkable” ap
proach becomes the dominant
national philosophy, we can be
sure the Russians will consider
nuclear war avery real possi
bility.
If 2700 years of Western Civili
zation are to be preserved, if, as
the President says, U.S. security
is the primary obligation of for
eign policy, if the real issue is
not peace but rather Western vic
tory, then it may be well to aban
don containment and head in the
other direction from the pacifists.

WHAT LIES in the other direc
tion? This; Carry a well co-ordi
nated war into the “peace zone.”
Support guerrilla operations in
Cuba and Laos, but also support
them in mainland China and
North Vietnam. Counter the Com
munists in all the Koreas which
may occur, but also take the in
itiative in '•upporting all the Hun
garys we can encourage. Wage
the war of the machine gun and
printing press. Develop a plan of
action integrating military and
paramilitary activities, foreign
aid, information programs, for
eign aid. information programs,
foreign student scholarships, ad
infinitum, all directed towards ul
timate victory. In brief, give the
Communists a taste of their own
tactics by recognizing the true
nature of the world conflict and
the geopolitical realities involved.
Such a program of action will
reverse the present situation and
put the Communists in the novel
position of frying to contain free
dom —hopefully with about the
same degree of, or less, success
than we are having in containing
communism.

The objection to such a pro
gram is going to be that the West
would be inconsistent by advanc
ing its ends with Communist tac
tics which the Communists often
make use of? Historical analysis
suggests the latter. (Anyway,
talk of inconsistency sounds
strange coming from those who
propose recognition of Red China
and her admission to the U.N.
while at the same time they
quiver in the throes of joy at men
tion of our breaking relations
with the Dominican Republic.)
Only within such a structure of
world wide activity against Com
munism can an invasion of Cuba
have any more meaning than
merely being a futile holding op
eration. If by some outside chance
this type of broad-visioned pro
gram is inaugurated, maybe even

quiver in the throes of joy at men
tion of our breaking relations
with the Dominican Republic.)
Only within such a structure of
world wide activity against Com
munism can an invasion of Cuba
have any more meaning than
merely being a futile holding op
eration. If by some outside chance
this type of broad-visioned pro
gram is inaugurated, maybe even
including another invasion of
Cuba (the Marines would love it),
let’s hope it is alittle better
planned—and better covered up—
than our past attempts in the
field.
The recent Cuban fiasco has
turned national attention towards
the consideration of some basic
issues in our protracted conflict
with the Communist world. The
most basic issue emerging—and
one often pointed to but seldom
explicitly stated—is the validity
of containment as the master
U.S. policy toward Communism.
The continuing debate shows
that the critics, while generally
accepting containment (which
has been U.S. policy since about
1948), fail to carry their position
through. Given the establishment
of a demonstrably Communist
oriented government in Cuba, a
country formerly anti-Communist
in international outlook, contain
ment calls for the eradication of
such a Communist advance.

BUT MORE IMPORTANT, Cas
tro’s Cuba shows the fatal short
comings of containment; 1) The
U.S. cannot possibly contain every
Communist advance by simply re
acting every time one is attempt
ed, and 3) containment is especi
ally unsuitable when it comes
time to counter anything but mili
tary or the most overt political
action.

All of this raises the question,
“What is containment” Basically,
it is a this-far-but-no-further poli
cy. Accordingly, Communist
moves against Korea or Berlin,
for example, have been met. More
fully, however, containment has
meant the division of the world
into two zones: the war zone, i.e.,
the West, where all the battles
are fought, and the peace zone,
i.e., the Communist world, which
is never touched in the continuing
conflict. By accepting in approxi
mate terms the 1948 status quo
as a limit for Western action, the
West gives a type of legitimacy
to the de facto Communist re
gimes. which legitimacy the Com
munists refuse to accord Western
governments. Hence, the war
zone-peace zone distinction we
respect their position, they don’t
respect ours.
From their sanctuary the Com
munists strike at the West know
ing that if thwarted in one at
tempt, they can shift the struggle
in time and space to another sec
tor in the war zone, believing all
the time that the inevitable tide of
history will bring success regard
less of the temporary ebb and
flow.

SO THE WEST wins a few, say
Korea, Berlin and Lebanon, but in
the meantime the Reds have
scored one, say North Vietnam.
How does it all balance up? For
more losses than gains, the Com
munists have come out ahead.
Who wouldn’t keep right on push
ing with odds like that?
Clearly a new American ap
proach is needed. In response, one
group looks at the realities of nu
clear war and comes up with vary

ing shades of pacificism. But just
because nuclear war is unpleasant
to consider and therefore declared
by some to be “unthinkable” does
not mean it is not a real possibili
ty. The day the “unthinkable” ap
proach becomes the dominant
national philosophy, we can be
sure the Russians will consider
nuclear war avery real possi
bility.
If 2700 years of Western Civili
zation are to be preserved, if, as
the President says, U.S. security
is the primary obligation of for
eign policy, if the real issue is
not peace but rather Western vic
tory, then it may be well to aban
don containment and head in the
other direction from the pacifists.

WHAT LIES in the other direc
tion? This; Carry a well co-ordi
nated war into the “peace zone.”
Support guerrilla operations in
Cuba and Laos, but also support
them in mainland China and
North Vietnam. Counter the Com
munists in all the Koreas which
may occur, but also take the in
itiative in '•upporting all the Hun
garys we can encourage. Wage
the war of the machine gun and
printing press. Develop a plan of
action integrating military and
paramilitary activities, foreign
aid, information programs, for
eign aid. information programs,
foreign student scholarships, ad
infinitum, all directed towards ul
timate victory. In brief, give the
Communists a taste of their own
tactics by recognizing the true
nature of the world conflict and
the geopolitical realities involved.
Such a program of action will
reverse the present situation and
put the Communists in the novel
position of frying to contain free
dom —hopefully with about the
same degree of, or less, success
than we are having in containing
communism.

The objection to such a pro
gram is going to be that the West
would be inconsistent by advanc
ing its ends with Communist tac
tics which the Communists often
make use of? Historical analysis
suggests the latter. (Anyway,
talk of inconsistency sounds
strange coming from those who
propose recognition of Red China
and her admission to the U.N.
while at the same time they
quiver in the throes of joy at men
tion of our breaking relations
with the Dominican Republic.)
