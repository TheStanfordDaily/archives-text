Prompt Discipline
I think it should he made clear
for the record in connection with
the problem of the “Fi.jis that the
Interfraternity Board at its meet
ing yesterday recommended not
only the dissolution of the local
chapter of MG fraternity in case
a satisfactory Alumni plan for
"receivership” is not forthcoming
within a week but also that appro
priate individual penalties be im
posed by the proper authorities
on the individuals concerned. The
latter point is not, as I understand
it, within the jurisdiction of the
Interfraternity Council or the In
terfraternity Board. However, the
Interfraternity Board felt it im
portant to make clear that it did
not consider a penalty on the fra
ternity itself, whatever that pen
alty might be, to be sufficient.
Speaking for myself (and I be
lieve for some other members of
the faculty including also some
members of the Interfraternity
Board) I believe that one of the
weaknesses of the disciplinary
system in the University, in
cluding fraternity problems but
extending also to problems out
side fraternities, is a tendency
sometimes to allow overt misbe
havior by individuals to pass with
out stiff and immediate individu
al penalties. Where three or four
applicants for admission to Stan
ford are turned down for every
one accepted, there is no apparent
justification for tolerating irre
sponsible or disorderly conduct
by most students who are admit
ted. If it comes to be understood
that serious misbehavior by un
dergraduates will bring about
strict and prompt (let me empha
size prompt) disciplinary action,
respect for good conduct and the
honor code will be enhanced. On
the other hand, whenever irre
sponsible and disorderly conduct
is allowed to pass without serious
consequences for the individuals
concerned, good order is under
mined and the honor code weak
ened.
As applied to fraternities, it
seems to me specially important
that penalties imposed on frater
nities, as such, should never be
substituted for appropriate pen
alties on the individuals con
cerned, but should be imposed in
addition to appropriate individual
penalties on individual culprits. I
believe that the first line of de
fense against repetition of the
kind of incidents which have re
cently occurred in connection with
fraternities is prompt and severe
action against the individuals in
volved. Penalties on particular
fraternities may also be required
in certain cases, but I think pen
alties on the group should be sup

plementary to prompt and stiff
penalties on guilty individuals.
After all, group responsibility
can exist only if it is rooted in a
firm sense of individual responsi
bility.

Concessions
Prof. Bark’s allegation that
Profs. Baran and Sweezy have ne
glected “the evidence” in favor of
“debaters’ tricks” rings rather
hollow. Prof. Baran has engaged
in public discussions of the Cuban
issue, and these discussions have
not been lacking in considerations
of empirical evidence. If there is
evidence to contradict Prof. Ba
ran. his opponents should be able
to go beyond evoking the spectre
of his Marxist bias in their attacks
on his position.
If Prof. Bark is serious in his
contention that Baran’s commit
ment to socialism automatically
makes his arguments unworthy
of consideration, may we then
conclude, for example, that the
opinions of E. H. Carr are equally
unworthy or that “old-fashioned”
anti-socialist commitment is a pre
requisite to academic virtue?
Such a contention is painfully
reminiscent of the argumentum
ad hominem of some communists
that “bourgeois” scholars are in
capable of objectivity.
Prof. Bark says, “Let’s look at
the record.” But then instead of
looking at the record of U.S. poli
cy toward Cuba he examines (he
record of communist imperialism
in Hungary, Tibet and elsewhere.
We are not acquainted with the
Baran-Sweezy position on Hun
gary or Tibet. If they excuse com
munist aggression in these areas
it is very sad indeed. But what
ever their opinion may be, it no
more impairs the validity of their
arguments on Cuba than the fail
ure to denounce the deeply im
moral aspects of Kennedy’s ag
gressive Cuban policy deprives
Profs. Bark and Shaw of the mor
al right to criticize Russia’s ac
tions in Hungary. The events of
1956 should never be forgotten,
but their use as awhipping horse
every time a serious criticism of
U.S. foreign policy emanates from
the left is a tragic mutation of the
memory of Hungarian rebels.
An event occurred in April 1961
which should plague the consci
ence of any American who con
siders himself a man of principle.
The American government ar
ranged, financed, armed and
trained an invasion force against
another country for the purpose
of imposing a regime upon that
country that would acquiesce to
U.S. will. That Cuban bodies were

used in this misadventure instead
of Americans is hardly more than
a technicality. There is even rea
son to believe that had the coun
ter-revolution been somewhat
more successful American troops
would have been “called in’’ by
Cordona just as Russian troops
were “called in” by Kadar. The
Guantanamo base may or may not
be vital to U.S. security, and the
Carpathian Mountain may or may
not be vital to the defense of the
USSR. Be that as it may, both
policies are morally indefensible,
strained arguments of Realpolitik
notwithstanding.
Many faculty members have
raised their voices against the
Kennedy Cuban policy and we are
happy to note that the History
Dep’t. has been well represented
among them. But to those who
feel that Baran’s scholasticism is
a more timely issue than the pos
sibility of new American aggres
sion against Cuba, there is little
to be said. It is easier to make
“concessions” about “mistakes” of
the past, as Prof. Shaw has done,
than to take a vigorous position
on the present and future. Many
communists left the Party after
Budapest, revolted by (he actions
of the USSR. How revolted would
our letter-writers have been if
U.S. marines had turned Havana
into a new Budapest? What “con
cessions” will they make if and
when this happens?

On Buck Club
The Daily’s May 22 editorial
stating that the Buck Club should
not give financial aid to athletes
who meet University standards
of need and scholarship is diffi
cult to understand.
All University financial assist
ance is directed toward the needy
student who shows scholastic
promise. Most awards adopt fur
ther criteria, ranging from the
Susan Leighton Grants-in-Aid re
quirement of “recommendation of
the Standford Dames’’ to the
Stanley Stemmer Beaubaire Me
morial Scholarship's requirement
that its recipient be a journalism
student. The features that set the
Buck Club Grants-in-Aid apart
are its criteria of Athletic De
partment recommendation and
that the recipient maintain a “C”
average.
Maintainence of a“C” average
is not an unusual criteria con
sidering that Stanford encourages
“any student having a “C” aver
age or better” to apply for assist
ance provided need is shown.
However, it must be the stipula
tion that Grant recipients be ath
letes that, Mr. N.H.W. objects to.
His objections seem to he based
on the implications that Stanford
athletes are not “contributing to
higher education” nor are they
"outstanding students.”
The 1960 football squad, which
is supported primarily by Buck
Club funds, had a higher fall

grade point average than all the
University men’s average. The
president of the student body is
presently on a Buck Club grant.
Twenty-one of the last seven
years' thirty-three basketball let
terwinners are in or have been
through graduate school. As
alums the 1951 football team’s
starting group (two platoons) is
now comprised of three lawyers,
four medical doctors, and five re
cipients of masters degrees in
various fields. And this list is far
from complete.
Stanford athletes have shown
and are proving they are a credit
to higher education and are out
standing students, in the same
sense that anyone else here has
proven their worth. Or should the
athletes’ accomplishments be con
sidered less valued than any other
student’s?
In the words of president Ster
ling, “Stanford believes strongly
in intercollegiate athletics as a
productive force In education.”
Yet Mr, N.H.W. considers ath
letes as an unproven and obvi
ously undeserving group of men.
As a gesture for reaching a
better understanding of the ath
lete’s worth at Stanford I cordi
ally invite Mr. N.H.W. to dinner
followed by an informal discus
sion at the Delta Tau Delta fra
ternity house at 6:00 p.m. on Mon
day, May 29.
