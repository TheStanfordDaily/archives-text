# As Expected-SC Cleans Up In AAWU Track Meet
## 
### BILL BLACK 
Everything went pretty much as expected as USC took eleven
first places to literally run off with the AAWU team championship
last Saturday at-Stanford Stadium.
The Trojans picked up 101 points in the meet. UCLA was a dis
tant second with 55 points. Cal beat Stanford by six points to take

third place and Washington ended
up last.
CISC picked up eleven first
places in the sixteen events and
led the team score almost from
the beginning.
Luther Hayes, Boh Pierce, and
Bruce Mann all picked up double
wins for the Trojans.
Stanford’s Dave Weill got the
Card’s only win by out-hurling
the field in the discus throw. In
dians Charley Barth and Rich
Klier also turned in top perform
ances.
IIAVKS got his first win in the
broad jump. Barth took the lead
on his fifth jump with a leap of
24-7 : h but didn’t stay ahead for
long. Hayes leaped 24-10 :i j on the
next jump to take first place.
The lithe hero’s second win was
in the hop-step-jump. His best ef
fort was 51-9L|. Craig Barrett of
Stanford took fourth with a leap
of 46-7.
Pierce not only won the high
and low hurdles hut also picked
up the league and stadium records

| in both events despite the lack of
| any strong competition.
MUNN got his wins in (ho hun
dred and the 220. His 9.9 clocking
in liio hundred was four lenths
of a second slower than his sea
son’s best but was good enough to
give him an easy win.
The fleet Trojan led the 200
from start to finish and steadily
pulled away from the field.
Weill wasted no time in taking
the lead in the discus and seemed
to get stronger every time he
threw. His first throw was a very
respectable 175 and he followed
immediately with a hurl of 177.
(HO got his winning toss of
I 179-2’l’ on his third try and then
fouled on a throw measured at
181.
Jack Pulnam of UCLA got his
] best throw of the season at 175-9’’_
i to take second place.
Weill's loss easily broke the old
league record of 172-9 u> set last
i year by Jim Wade of USC.
CARD Don Bell took fifth place
with a throw of 166-11*2 despite
the fact that he was hampered by
a sprained ankle, which lie injured
two weeks ago and which had not
completely healed.
Klier almost upset favorite
Andy Dunkell of UCLA in the 880.
He took the lead about two thirds
of the way through the first lap
and led by about, two yards at the
end of the lap.
He increased his lead to about
five yards halfway through the
second lap but was unable to
match Dunkell’s finishing sprint
and was passed about 15 yards
from the finish.
KEIEK also did a fine job on
the anchor leg of the mile relay.
He started in fifth place and with
in half a lap had pulled up to
third. He continued to increase
his lead over Rick Harder who
was running for Washington in
fourth place and beat Harder to
the tape by 112I 1 2 seconds.
The shot put was completely
dominated by Dallas Long of USC
as expected. Long won with a put

of 63-’ 2. Ilis closest rival was
Clark Branson of UCLA whose

best put was 59-9. Long’s shortest
put in six tries was 61-4.
The pole vault was highlighted
by a duel between John Cramer
of Washington and Trojan Jim
Brewer. Brewer cleared 15 feet on
his first try. Cramer made it op
his second leap. Both men failed
to clear 15-4 in three tries and the
event ended in a tie.
PHIL WHITE of Stanford clear
er 13-6 but was eliminated at 14
feet.
Trojan Bob Avant easily won
the high jump with a leap of
6-10*2. Avant, who has cleared
seven feet, tried three times at
6-11 Vs but failed to make it over.
Card John Pontius got fourth

with a .lump of 6-2 I L>.
I The javelin was won by Trojan
j Bob Sbordone, who threw the
spear 232-BVi. Bruin C. K. Yang
I was second. Third was Art Batch
elder of Stanford whose best
throw was 226-51 •>.
STANFORD’S John Northway
led for the first two laps of the
three mile but the pace proved to
be too strong and Northway grad
j ually lost ground and finished
fifth. The race was won by Alan
Gaylord of Cal who finished 180
yards ahead of second place Walt
Maxwell of UCLA.

Versatile star jumping in AAWU meet
Everything went pretty much as expected as USC took eleven
first places to literally run off with the AAWU team championship
last Saturday at-Stanford Stadium.
The Trojans picked up 101 points in the meet. UCLA was a dis
tant second with 55 points. Cal beat Stanford by six points to take

third place and Washington ended
up last.
CISC picked up eleven first
places in the sixteen events and
led the team score almost from
the beginning.
Luther Hayes, Boh Pierce, and
Bruce Mann all picked up double
wins for the Trojans.
Stanford’s Dave Weill got the
Card’s only win by out-hurling
the field in the discus throw. In
dians Charley Barth and Rich
Klier also turned in top perform
ances.
IIAVKS got his first win in the
broad jump. Barth took the lead
on his fifth jump with a leap of
24-7 : h but didn’t stay ahead for
long. Hayes leaped 24-10 :i j on the
next jump to take first place.
The lithe hero’s second win was
in the hop-step-jump. His best ef
fort was 51-9L|. Craig Barrett of
Stanford took fourth with a leap
of 46-7.
Pierce not only won the high
and low hurdles hut also picked
up the league and stadium records

| in both events despite the lack of
| any strong competition.
MUNN got his wins in (ho hun
dred and the 220. His 9.9 clocking
in liio hundred was four lenths
of a second slower than his sea
son’s best but was good enough to
give him an easy win.
The fleet Trojan led the 200
from start to finish and steadily
pulled away from the field.
Weill wasted no time in taking
the lead in the discus and seemed
to get stronger every time he
threw. His first throw was a very
respectable 175 and he followed
immediately with a hurl of 177.
(HO got his winning toss of
I 179-2’l’ on his third try and then
fouled on a throw measured at
181.
Jack Pulnam of UCLA got his
] best throw of the season at 175-9’’_
i to take second place.
Weill's loss easily broke the old
league record of 172-9 u> set last
i year by Jim Wade of USC.
CARD Don Bell took fifth place
with a throw of 166-11*2 despite
the fact that he was hampered by
a sprained ankle, which lie injured
two weeks ago and which had not
completely healed.
Klier almost upset favorite
Andy Dunkell of UCLA in the 880.
He took the lead about two thirds
of the way through the first lap
and led by about, two yards at the
end of the lap.
He increased his lead to about
five yards halfway through the
second lap but was unable to
match Dunkell’s finishing sprint
and was passed about 15 yards
from the finish.
KEIEK also did a fine job on
the anchor leg of the mile relay.
He started in fifth place and with
in half a lap had pulled up to
third. He continued to increase
his lead over Rick Harder who
was running for Washington in
fourth place and beat Harder to
the tape by 112I 1 2 seconds.
The shot put was completely
dominated by Dallas Long of USC
as expected. Long won with a put

of 63-’ 2. Ilis closest rival was
Clark Branson of UCLA whose

best put was 59-9. Long’s shortest
put in six tries was 61-4.
The pole vault was highlighted
by a duel between John Cramer
of Washington and Trojan Jim
Brewer. Brewer cleared 15 feet on
his first try. Cramer made it op
his second leap. Both men failed
to clear 15-4 in three tries and the
event ended in a tie.
PHIL WHITE of Stanford clear
er 13-6 but was eliminated at 14
feet.
Trojan Bob Avant easily won
the high jump with a leap of
6-10*2. Avant, who has cleared
seven feet, tried three times at
6-11 Vs but failed to make it over.
Card John Pontius got fourth

with a .lump of 6-2 I L>.
I The javelin was won by Trojan
j Bob Sbordone, who threw the
spear 232-BVi. Bruin C. K. Yang
I was second. Third was Art Batch
elder of Stanford whose best
throw was 226-51 •>.
STANFORD’S John Northway
led for the first two laps of the
three mile but the pace proved to
be too strong and Northway grad
j ually lost ground and finished
fifth. The race was won by Alan

CARD CRAIG BARRETT
Versatile star jumping in AAWU meet
Everything went pretty much as expected as USC took eleven
first places to literally run off with the AAWU team championship
last Saturday at-Stanford Stadium.
The Trojans picked up 101 points in the meet. UCLA was a dis
tant second with 55 points. Cal beat Stanford by six points to take

third place and Washington ended
up last.
CISC picked up eleven first
places in the sixteen events and
led the team score almost from
the beginning.
Luther Hayes, Boh Pierce, and
Bruce Mann all picked up double
wins for the Trojans.
Stanford’s Dave Weill got the
Card’s only win by out-hurling
the field in the discus throw. In
dians Charley Barth and Rich
Klier also turned in top perform
ances.
IIAVKS got his first win in the
broad jump. Barth took the lead
on his fifth jump with a leap of
24-7 : h but didn’t stay ahead for
long. Hayes leaped 24-10 :i j on the
next jump to take first place.
The lithe hero’s second win was
in the hop-step-jump. His best ef
fort was 51-9L|. Craig Barrett of
Stanford took fourth with a leap
of 46-7.
Pierce not only won the high
and low hurdles hut also picked
up the league and stadium records

| in both events despite the lack of
| any strong competition.
MUNN got his wins in (ho hun
dred and the 220. His 9.9 clocking
in liio hundred was four lenths
of a second slower than his sea
son’s best but was good enough to
give him an easy win.
The fleet Trojan led the 200
from start to finish and steadily
pulled away from the field.
Weill wasted no time in taking
the lead in the discus and seemed
to get stronger every time he
threw. His first throw was a very
respectable 175 and he followed
immediately with a hurl of 177.
(HO got his winning toss of
I 179-2’l’ on his third try and then
fouled on a throw measured at
181.
Jack Pulnam of UCLA got his
] best throw of the season at 175-9’’_
i to take second place.
Weill's loss easily broke the old
league record of 172-9 u> set last
i year by Jim Wade of USC.
CARD Don Bell took fifth place
with a throw of 166-11*2 despite
the fact that he was hampered by
a sprained ankle, which lie injured
two weeks ago and which had not
completely healed.
Klier almost upset favorite
Andy Dunkell of UCLA in the 880.
He took the lead about two thirds
of the way through the first lap
and led by about, two yards at the
end of the lap.
He increased his lead to about
five yards halfway through the
second lap but was unable to
match Dunkell’s finishing sprint
and was passed about 15 yards
from the finish.
KEIEK also did a fine job on
the anchor leg of the mile relay.
He started in fifth place and with
in half a lap had pulled up to
third. He continued to increase
his lead over Rick Harder who
was running for Washington in
fourth place and beat Harder to
the tape by 112I 1 2 seconds.
The shot put was completely
dominated by Dallas Long of USC
as expected. Long won with a put

of 63-’ 2. Ilis closest rival was
Clark Branson of UCLA whose

best put was 59-9. Long’s shortest
put in six tries was 61-4.
The pole vault was highlighted
by a duel between John Cramer
of Washington and Trojan Jim
Brewer. Brewer cleared 15 feet on
his first try. Cramer made it op
his second leap. Both men failed
to clear 15-4 in three tries and the
event ended in a tie.
PHIL WHITE of Stanford clear
er 13-6 but was eliminated at 14
feet.
Trojan Bob Avant easily won
the high jump with a leap of
6-10*2. Avant, who has cleared
seven feet, tried three times at
6-11 Vs but failed to make it over.
Card John Pontius got fourth

with a .lump of 6-2 I L>.
I The javelin was won by Trojan
j Bob Sbordone, who threw the
spear 232-BVi. Bruin C. K. Yang
I was second. Third was Art Batch
elder of Stanford whose best
throw was 226-51 •>.
STANFORD’S John Northway
led for the first two laps of the
three mile but the pace proved to
be too strong and Northway grad
j ually lost ground and finished
fifth. The race was won by Alan

CARD CRAIG BARRETT
Versatile star jumping in AAWU meet
Everything went pretty much as expected as USC took eleven
first places to literally run off with the AAWU team championship
last Saturday at-Stanford Stadium.
The Trojans picked up 101 points in the meet. UCLA was a dis
tant second with 55 points. Cal beat Stanford by six points to take

third place and Washington ended
up last.
CISC picked up eleven first
places in the sixteen events and
led the team score almost from
the beginning.
Luther Hayes, Boh Pierce, and
Bruce Mann all picked up double
wins for the Trojans.
Stanford’s Dave Weill got the
Card’s only win by out-hurling
the field in the discus throw. In
dians Charley Barth and Rich
Klier also turned in top perform
ances.
IIAVKS got his first win in the
broad jump. Barth took the lead
on his fifth jump with a leap of
24-7 : h but didn’t stay ahead for
long. Hayes leaped 24-10 :i j on the
next jump to take first place.
The lithe hero’s second win was
in the hop-step-jump. His best ef
fort was 51-9L|. Craig Barrett of
Stanford took fourth with a leap
of 46-7.
Pierce not only won the high
and low hurdles hut also picked
up the league and stadium records

| in both events despite the lack of
| any strong competition.
MUNN got his wins in (ho hun
dred and the 220. His 9.9 clocking
in liio hundred was four lenths
of a second slower than his sea
son’s best but was good enough to
give him an easy win.
The fleet Trojan led the 200
from start to finish and steadily
pulled away from the field.
Weill wasted no time in taking
the lead in the discus and seemed
to get stronger every time he
threw. His first throw was a very
respectable 175 and he followed
immediately with a hurl of 177.
(HO got his winning toss of
I 179-2’l’ on his third try and then
fouled on a throw measured at
181.
Jack Pulnam of UCLA got his
] best throw of the season at 175-9’’_
i to take second place.
Weill's loss easily broke the old
league record of 172-9 u> set last
i year by Jim Wade of USC.
CARD Don Bell took fifth place
with a throw of 166-11*2 despite
the fact that he was hampered by
a sprained ankle, which lie injured
two weeks ago and which had not
completely healed.
Klier almost upset favorite
Andy Dunkell of UCLA in the 880.
He took the lead about two thirds
of the way through the first lap
and led by about, two yards at the
end of the lap.
He increased his lead to about
five yards halfway through the
second lap but was unable to
match Dunkell’s finishing sprint
and was passed about 15 yards
from the finish.
KEIEK also did a fine job on
the anchor leg of the mile relay.
He started in fifth place and with
in half a lap had pulled up to
third. He continued to increase
his lead over Rick Harder who
was running for Washington in
fourth place and beat Harder to
the tape by 112I 1 2 seconds.
The shot put was completely
dominated by Dallas Long of USC
as expected. Long won with a put

of 63-’ 2. Ilis closest rival was
Clark Branson of UCLA whose

best put was 59-9. Long’s shortest
put in six tries was 61-4.
The pole vault was highlighted
by a duel between John Cramer
of Washington and Trojan Jim
Brewer. Brewer cleared 15 feet on
his first try. Cramer made it op
his second leap. Both men failed
to clear 15-4 in three tries and the
event ended in a tie.
PHIL WHITE of Stanford clear
er 13-6 but was eliminated at 14
feet.
Trojan Bob Avant easily won
the high jump with a leap of
6-10*2. Avant, who has cleared
seven feet, tried three times at
6-11 Vs but failed to make it over.
Card John Pontius got fourth

with a .lump of 6-2 I L>.
I The javelin was won by Trojan
j Bob Sbordone, who threw the
spear 232-BVi. Bruin C. K. Yang
I was second. Third was Art Batch
elder of Stanford whose best
throw was 226-51 •>.
STANFORD’S John Northway
led for the first two laps of the
three mile but the pace proved to
be too strong and Northway grad
j ually lost ground and finished
fifth. The race was won by Alan

CARD CRAIG BARRETT
Versatile star jumping in AAWU meet
Everything went pretty much as expected as USC took eleven
first places to literally run off with the AAWU team championship
last Saturday at-Stanford Stadium.
The Trojans picked up 101 points in the meet. UCLA was a dis
tant second with 55 points. Cal beat Stanford by six points to take

third place and Washington ended
up last.
CISC picked up eleven first
places in the sixteen events and
led the team score almost from
the beginning.
Luther Hayes, Boh Pierce, and
Bruce Mann all picked up double
wins for the Trojans.
Stanford’s Dave Weill got the
Card’s only win by out-hurling
the field in the discus throw. In
dians Charley Barth and Rich
Klier also turned in top perform
ances.
IIAVKS got his first win in the
broad jump. Barth took the lead
on his fifth jump with a leap of
24-7 : h but didn’t stay ahead for
long. Hayes leaped 24-10 :i j on the
next jump to take first place.
The lithe hero’s second win was
in the hop-step-jump. His best ef
fort was 51-9L|. Craig Barrett of
Stanford took fourth with a leap
of 46-7.
Pierce not only won the high
and low hurdles hut also picked
up the league and stadium records

| in both events despite the lack of
| any strong competition.
MUNN got his wins in (ho hun
dred and the 220. His 9.9 clocking
in liio hundred was four lenths
of a second slower than his sea
son’s best but was good enough to
give him an easy win.
The fleet Trojan led the 200
from start to finish and steadily
pulled away from the field.
Weill wasted no time in taking
the lead in the discus and seemed
to get stronger every time he
threw. His first throw was a very
respectable 175 and he followed
immediately with a hurl of 177.
(HO got his winning toss of
I 179-2’l’ on his third try and then
fouled on a throw measured at
181.
Jack Pulnam of UCLA got his
] best throw of the season at 175-9’’_
i to take second place.
Weill's loss easily broke the old
league record of 172-9 u> set last
i year by Jim Wade of USC.
CARD Don Bell took fifth place
with a throw of 166-11*2 despite
the fact that he was hampered by
a sprained ankle, which lie injured
two weeks ago and which had not
completely healed.
Klier almost upset favorite
Andy Dunkell of UCLA in the 880.
He took the lead about two thirds
of the way through the first lap
and led by about, two yards at the
end of the lap.
He increased his lead to about
five yards halfway through the
second lap but was unable to
match Dunkell’s finishing sprint
and was passed about 15 yards
from the finish.
KEIEK also did a fine job on
the anchor leg of the mile relay.
He started in fifth place and with
in half a lap had pulled up to
third. He continued to increase
his lead over Rick Harder who
was running for Washington in
fourth place and beat Harder to
the tape by 112I 1 2 seconds.
The shot put was completely
dominated by Dallas Long of USC
as expected. Long won with a put

of 63-’ 2. Ilis closest rival was
Clark Branson of UCLA whose

best put was 59-9. Long’s shortest
put in six tries was 61-4.
The pole vault was highlighted
by a duel between John Cramer
of Washington and Trojan Jim
Brewer. Brewer cleared 15 feet on
his first try. Cramer made it op
his second leap. Both men failed
to clear 15-4 in three tries and the
event ended in a tie.
PHIL WHITE of Stanford clear
er 13-6 but was eliminated at 14
feet.
Trojan Bob Avant easily won
the high jump with a leap of
6-10*2. Avant, who has cleared
seven feet, tried three times at
6-11 Vs but failed to make it over.
Card John Pontius got fourth

with a .lump of 6-2 I L>.
I The javelin was won by Trojan
j Bob Sbordone, who threw the
spear 232-BVi. Bruin C. K. Yang
I was second. Third was Art Batch
elder of Stanford whose best
throw was 226-51 •>.
STANFORD’S John Northway
led for the first two laps of the
three mile but the pace proved to
be too strong and Northway grad
j ually lost ground and finished
fifth. The race was won by Alan

Versatile star jumping in AAWU meet
Everything went pretty much as expected as USC took eleven
first places to literally run off with the AAWU team championship
last Saturday at-Stanford Stadium.
The Trojans picked up 101 points in the meet. UCLA was a dis
tant second with 55 points. Cal beat Stanford by six points to take

third place and Washington ended
up last.
CISC picked up eleven first
places in the sixteen events and
led the team score almost from
the beginning.
Luther Hayes, Boh Pierce, and
Bruce Mann all picked up double
wins for the Trojans.
Stanford’s Dave Weill got the
Card’s only win by out-hurling
the field in the discus throw. In
dians Charley Barth and Rich
Klier also turned in top perform
ances.
IIAVKS got his first win in the
broad jump. Barth took the lead
on his fifth jump with a leap of
24-7 : h but didn’t stay ahead for
long. Hayes leaped 24-10 :i j on the
next jump to take first place.
The lithe hero’s second win was
in the hop-step-jump. His best ef
fort was 51-9L|. Craig Barrett of
Stanford took fourth with a leap
of 46-7.
Pierce not only won the high
and low hurdles hut also picked
up the league and stadium records

| in both events despite the lack of
| any strong competition.
MUNN got his wins in (ho hun
dred and the 220. His 9.9 clocking
in liio hundred was four lenths
of a second slower than his sea
son’s best but was good enough to
give him an easy win.
The fleet Trojan led the 200
from start to finish and steadily
pulled away from the field.
Weill wasted no time in taking
the lead in the discus and seemed
to get stronger every time he
threw. His first throw was a very
respectable 175 and he followed
immediately with a hurl of 177.
(HO got his winning toss of
I 179-2’l’ on his third try and then
fouled on a throw measured at
181.
Jack Pulnam of UCLA got his
] best throw of the season at 175-9’’_
i to take second place.
Weill's loss easily broke the old
league record of 172-9 u> set last
i year by Jim Wade of USC.
CARD Don Bell took fifth place
with a throw of 166-11*2 despite
the fact that he was hampered by
a sprained ankle, which lie injured
two weeks ago and which had not
completely healed.
Klier almost upset favorite
Andy Dunkell of UCLA in the 880.
He took the lead about two thirds
of the way through the first lap
and led by about, two yards at the
end of the lap.
He increased his lead to about
five yards halfway through the
second lap but was unable to
match Dunkell’s finishing sprint
and was passed about 15 yards
from the finish.
KEIEK also did a fine job on
the anchor leg of the mile relay.
He started in fifth place and with
in half a lap had pulled up to
third. He continued to increase
his lead over Rick Harder who
was running for Washington in
fourth place and beat Harder to
the tape by 112I 1 2 seconds.
The shot put was completely
dominated by Dallas Long of USC
as expected. Long won with a put

of 63-’ 2. Ilis closest rival was
Clark Branson of UCLA whose

best put was 59-9. Long’s shortest
put in six tries was 61-4.
The pole vault was highlighted
by a duel between John Cramer
of Washington and Trojan Jim
Brewer. Brewer cleared 15 feet on
his first try. Cramer made it op
his second leap. Both men failed
to clear 15-4 in three tries and the
event ended in a tie.
PHIL WHITE of Stanford clear
er 13-6 but was eliminated at 14
feet.
Trojan Bob Avant easily won
the high jump with a leap of
6-10*2. Avant, who has cleared
seven feet, tried three times at
6-11 Vs but failed to make it over.
Card John Pontius got fourth

with a .lump of 6-2 I L>.
I The javelin was won by Trojan
j Bob Sbordone, who threw the
spear 232-BVi. Bruin C. K. Yang
I was second. Third was Art Batch
elder of Stanford whose best
throw was 226-51 •>.
STANFORD’S John Northway
led for the first two laps of the
three mile but the pace proved to
be too strong and Northway grad
j ually lost ground and finished
fifth. The race was won by Alan
Gaylord of Cal who finished 180
yards ahead of second place Walt
Maxwell of UCLA.
