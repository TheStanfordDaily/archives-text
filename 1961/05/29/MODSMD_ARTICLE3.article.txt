Bill) Blakley for a U.S. senate
seat.
Tower held a small but insur
mountable lead over Blakley ac
cording to almost complete un
official returns from the Texas

strengthen its hand at home to
cope with internal unrest.
The Cuban government trans
mitter warned Gutemala against
lending any further aid to ene
mies of the revolution. It said the
failure of last month’s Pig’s Bay
invasion attempt “has bared the
weakness of the Gutemalan

much weaker and less trained,
should be a pushover for Cuba.”

Tower’s stunning upset over
Democrat William A. (Cowboy
Bill) Blakley for a U.S. senate
seat.
Tower held a small but insur
mountable lead over Blakley ac
cording to almost complete un
official returns from the Texas
election bureau in Dallas.
Tower, a 5-foot, 5 Mi-inch co„, go
professor, held an 8,099-vote lead

MIAMI —Havana radio resumed
its verbal attack on Gutemala
today with charges the Miguel
Ydigoras Fuentes regime permit
ted anti-Castro invasion troops to
train on Gutomalan soil only to
strengthen its hand at home to
cope with internal unrest.
The Cuban government trans
mitter warned Gutemala against
lending any further aid to ene
mies of the revolution. It said the
failure of last month’s Pig’s Bay
invasion attempt “has bared the
weakness of the Gutemalan
armed forces . . .
“If the counter-revolutionary
expedition was put to flight in
less than 72 hours,” Havana ra
dio said, “the Guatemalan army,
much weaker and less trained,
should be a pushover for Cuba.”
SEOUL, Korea, (UPI) — The
South Korea Military Junta today
charged that 12 big businessmen,
12 former government officials
and four retired generals and an
admiral had practiced corruption
for eight years and promised a
swift trial and justice. All but
three or four were arrested.
The Junta also carried out a
drastic reduction in the number
of Korean newspapers and Korean
news agencies to bo allowed to
operate in the future.
Many of the 29 named today in
the government’s latest move
against big time corruption were
two time losers. Some already
were in jail awaiting trial or serv
ing prison sentences for similar
charges lodged with the downfall
of President Syngman Rhee.
