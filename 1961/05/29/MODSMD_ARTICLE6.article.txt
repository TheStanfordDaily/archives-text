# '61 Quad Emerges
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Managing Editor 
The 1961 Quad —472 pages of
outstanding pictures and witty
captions—will be distributed to
da!y and tomorrow from 8 am.
to 5 p.m. at the Quad shack.
For those who have not already
bought one, the Quads will be on
sale at the same pfice of $8 a
copy.

staff wrote all the wonderful cap

is funnier than the Chappie.”
The large group of color photos
is filled with high quality prints.
The black and white photos also
are excellent, with a few obvious
exceptions.
THE ONLY glaring mistake is
the caption under freshman class
president Bob Friese’s picture,
which tells his ambition to “go
to law school, study inter—”
Next year’s editor Gary Klein
requests that any organization
not in this year’s book contact
him if they desire to be in next
year’s Quad.
