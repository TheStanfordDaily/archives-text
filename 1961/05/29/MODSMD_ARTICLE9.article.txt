“The vole of the Northerner is
to dramatize the fact that racial
discrimination is no longer a mat
ter of local mores hut a matter of
national interest.” Rev. William
Sloane Coffin Jr. told the Daily in
a telephone interview last night.
“There can’t lie a cooling off
period unless there is some guar
antee that segregation will not
continue,” Coffin explained.
"Otherwise,” he stated, “the mob
is given a deciding vote.”
“Why should the Negro have to
make all the concessions?" Cof
fin continued. “We’ve got to show
that the nation just won't take it.”
Coffin, who is chaplain of
Yale University, spent part of last
week on a bus and part of It in
jail. He was one of a group of
seven “freedom riders” who rode
from Atlanta, Georgia to Mont
gomery Alabama, to protest bus
travel segregation in the South.
Last January Coffin spoke to
the Stanford student body about
Peace Corps possibilities and
teaching opportunities in Africa.
The dynamic speaker gave sub
stantial momentum to the HR
African Desk’s program for plac
ing Stanford graduate students
as teachers in Africa.
Coffin, who is a member of the
National Advisory Council to the
Peace Corps, was arrested and
jailed with the rest of Ids group
of freedom riders when they ate
lunch at a segregated lunch coun
ter on Thursday.
Bail was raised for the prison
ers at Yale, Wesleyan, and else
where. Half of the group declined
bail and are still in jail. The rest
of the group. Coffin among them,
accepted the money because they
had final exams or speaking en
gagements.
Earlier Thursday morning the
group had eaten breakfast at the
same counter and were not dis
turbed. That was before the Fed
eral marshals sent by Attorney
General Robert Kennedy left the
city.
Specific charges against the
group are not yet known. Similar
groups have been charged with
disturbing the peace, inciting to
riot, and disobeying orders of an
officer.
