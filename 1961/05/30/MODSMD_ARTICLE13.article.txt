# Memorial Church To Honor War Dead
## 
### 
A brief service in Memorial Church this morning will mark the
University's observance of Memorial Day. The service will honor
those who gave that great gift—their life—for their country.
President Kennedy, too, has talked of much of the sacrifices we
must make as a nation and as individuals to preserve our unigue
form of government. The columnists also call for sacrifice whenever
the Russians score a point in the cold war.
While personal and national sacrifices must be made, we must
also guard against a gradual exchange of this freedom for greater
security against the omnipresent Soviet system.
We men have lost the freedom of deciding what to do with some
years of our lives because of the draft. The income tax has cut down
our freedom of spending. Many of our businessmen and scientists
must devote their time to preparation of defense machinery instead
of laboring for the improvement of mankind.
Our society is not as free as it was a half century ago. Yet this
freedom gives us an advantage over every dictatorship. It may be
difficult to visualize freedom when, like the air, it surrounds us. It is
indeed a treasure noted in its absence.
But it will be well for all of us, sometime this Memorial Day, to
reflect on our freedom and resolve not to be deceived by those who
say we cannot be free and still defend ourselves.
