## Both Mr. 'K', de Gaulle Deal in Power Politics 
### 
The run of bad news from Cuba,
Laos, Alabama, is, of course, a
depressing prelude to the Presi
dent’s trip abroad. But we must
not exaggerate. While the re
verses we have suffered have hurt
us with our allies and friends, I
do not think they will have any
substantial effect, one way or
the other, on the basic problems
which the President will be deal
ing with both in Paris and in Vi
enna.
In Paris, the problem will be
how the Western Alliance is to be
managed. In Vienna, the problem
will be how the relations between
the two great constellations are
to be controlled. The two men
with whom the President will be
talking are realists who calculate
their policy primarily in terms of
national power. There are almost
no American public men who are
realists in the same degree. At
least they do not talk out loud
about it. Gen. de Gaulle and Mr.
Khrushchev believe in their own
calculations of what the various
powers can do, and in their own
thinking they are very little im
pressed by, indeed they have a
very high degree of immunity to,
public relations and “images” and
that sort of thing. Mr. Khrush
chev is, of course, a great propa
gandist. But his policy is based on
a cold calculation of power.
THE LANGUAGE of the Paris
and Vienna talks will have tu be
the language of power politics—
which deals with what nations
will do in relation to what they
can do when their truly vital in
terests are involved.
There is, I realize, a certain
tactlessness in speaking of what is
common to the Paris and Vienna
meetings. Indeed, I was one of
those who thought that it would
be more tactful if the President
did not go straight to his meeting
with Gen. de Gaulle to a meeting
with Mr. Khrushchev. But now
that the arrangements have been
set—with the blessing, so I hear,
of Gen. de Gaulle himself—it is
useful to realize not only that the
President will be talking with two
realists, but that their realistic
calculations arise from the same
factual base.
This is the fact that American
Military supremacy, which lasted
from 1945 until shortly after 1955,
has been replaced by a balance of
power. This is the central event of
our time, and its affects profound
ly and pervasively all internation
al relations.
When the President meets Gen.
de Gaulle, he will find a man who
with the insight of genius, is
acutely aware of the change in the
world balance of power. This
balance of power, this awareness
is the root of his disbelief in the
validity of the NATO structure

| and strategy. This is the root of
his lack of confidence, which must
not be ignored, in the United
States as the protector of Europe
and the leader of the world. This
lack of confidence is the root of
his demand for intimate and con
tinual consultation on world af
fairs. This, too, is the root of his
insistence on a policy, which may
Ibe impractical, that France have
an independent nuclear force.
IT WOULD BE vain to suppose
that ayone can restore the Ameri
can paramountry built upon the
nuclear monopoly of the post-war
days. The United Nations, NATO,
CENTO, SEATO—the grand po
litical structure built upon the old
paramountcy is shaken. It is this
shaking which constitutes a large
part of the subject matter of our
diplomacy.

In Mr. Khrushchev the Presi
dent will meet a man who is deep
ly conscious of, whose policy is
governed by, the new fact that
there is a balance of power. Un
less I am much mistaken, Mr.
Khrushchev’s confidence in Soviet
power is accompanied by a very
healthy respect for American
power.

I do not share the views of those
who are afraid that our reverses
in Cuba and Laos have caused
him to underrate American power
or American determination. He
knows perfectly well that the
United States could take Havana
in an afternoon, and that what re
strains us is not fear of Soviet
misiles but a recognition of the
political disaster we would pre
cipitate throughout the hemi
sphere and the free world.

As for Laos, he has had, of
course, the certainty that we
could not fight a Korean war in

Indo-China. We could not fight it
because in 1960 we do not have as
we had in 1950 a monopoly of nu
clear weapons which could in the
last resort be decisive.
AS I UNDERSTAND it, the new
Soviet dogma—that all inter
national dealing must be tri-par
tile and by unanimous consent—
rests ultimately on the same fact,
that there is a balance of power.
When there is a balance of power
between two states, each state
has a veto. Nothing can be done
unless they agree.

Mr. Khrushchev carries this
principle to an extreme point.
Thus there might be agreement to
abide by the judgment of a third
party. That, in effect, is what we
want. Mr. Khrushchev is more ve
hement and more irreconcilable
than his own principle requires.
In any event the controlling fact
in dealing with Mr. Khrushchev is
his insistence upon a full recogni
tion, with all its consequences
spelled out, of the new balance of
power.
