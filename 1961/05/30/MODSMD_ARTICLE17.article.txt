Coaching as a career offers many important advantages, but
one seldom considered is world travel. This summer youthful Jim
Terrill, assistant Card track coach, will be doing just that as he
heads for Yugoslavia to act as advisory coach for the Balkan athletes.
Terrill, who will leave later this week, is being sent by the AAWU
at the invitation of the Yugoslav Athletic Association.
As advisory coach, the former Occidental College middle distance
star will travel from area to area helping athletes of all ages. He
will work with the Yugoslav national coach, Dragan Petrovich, in
planning clinics and meets for the country’s up-and-coming crop
of athletes.

YUGOSLAVIA, still saddled
with the expense of an intense de
velopment program and large
armed force, has had little chance
to develop sports facilities. “They
have some very fine coaches, anti
I won’t be helping them much. I
will work primarily with the ath
letes,” Terrill asserts.

The Yugoslavs, with a grow
ing interest in track, are pointing
toward the European Champion
ships to be held in Belgrade in
1962. Obviously thinking in terms
of the 100,000 spectators drawn to
Stanford for the Olympic tryouts
last summer, Petrovich extended
his invitation through the AAWU.
Terrill will also he helping the
Yugoslavs to prepare for the Bal
kan Games to be held in Septem
ber and meets against the French
in Paris and the Czechs in Bel
grade.

Among the athletes he will be training will be Olympic stars
Velisa Mugosa, who has run everything from 1500 meters to 5,000,
and Milija Jocovic, a shot putter. Mugosa has a 3:45 clocking in the
1,500 to his credit which is equivalent to about a four-minute mile.
ON THK LIGHTFK side. Terrill hopes to do some sight seeing
on the way over and maybe afterwards, but during the summer he
will have his mind on the job at hand. He has been working on the
rather difficult Yugoslav language with a janitor in the Education
Building, Marco Radesic. a native whose family still resides in (he
home country. To date his speaking knowledge is “enough to be of
some help in coaching.”
Stiffening Blow for Little League
The baseball world was saddened to hear of another Little
League death yesterday when 10*-year-old George McCormick of
Chicago succumbed to a brain injury inflicted by a line drive which
had struck him five days earlier. This was the second such death,
coming in the wake of the fatal beaning of Barry Babcock, aged
nine, in Temple City May 18.
It is unfortunate that the first two deaths in the long history of
Little League should come within eleven days of eai h other. Such
disasters naturally lead to speculation about the value of organized
ball for youngsters. But we think in considering such a question
the opinions of both parents should be foremost.
MR. JACK BABCOCK SAID, “I hope this doesn’t curtail Little
League ball. Barry wouldn’t want that. He loved baseball more than
anything. He just lived and breathed for the day he could make one
of the uniformed teams.’’ Mr. George McCormick reacted in the
same tone, “My boy always dreamed of playing ball. I don’t want
this to become a black mark against Little League baseball; I think
it’s a good thing.”

ON THK LIGHTFK side. Terrill hopes to do some sight seeing
on the way over and maybe afterwards, but during the summer he
will have his mind on the job at hand. He has been working on the
rather difficult Yugoslav language with a janitor in the Education
Building, Marco Radesic. a native whose family still resides in (he
home country. To date his speaking knowledge is “enough to be of
some help in coaching.”
Stiffening Blow for Little League
The baseball world was saddened to hear of another Little
League death yesterday when 10*-year-old George McCormick of
Chicago succumbed to a brain injury inflicted by a line drive which
had struck him five days earlier. This was the second such death,
coming in the wake of the fatal beaning of Barry Babcock, aged
nine, in Temple City May 18.
It is unfortunate that the first two deaths in the long history of
Little League should come within eleven days of eai h other. Such
disasters naturally lead to speculation about the value of organized
ball for youngsters. But we think in considering such a question
the opinions of both parents should be foremost.
MR. JACK BABCOCK SAID, “I hope this doesn’t curtail Little
League ball. Barry wouldn’t want that. He loved baseball more than
anything. He just lived and breathed for the day he could make one
of the uniformed teams.’’ Mr. George McCormick reacted in the
same tone, “My boy always dreamed of playing ball. I don’t want
this to become a black mark against Little League baseball; I think
it’s a good thing.”


JIM TERRILL
Packing for Yugoslavia
The Latest in Foreign Aid

Coaching as a career offers many important advantages, but
one seldom considered is world travel. This summer youthful Jim
Terrill, assistant Card track coach, will be doing just that as he
heads for Yugoslavia to act as advisory coach for the Balkan athletes.
Terrill, who will leave later this week, is being sent by the AAWU
at the invitation of the Yugoslav Athletic Association.
As advisory coach, the former Occidental College middle distance
star will travel from area to area helping athletes of all ages. He
will work with the Yugoslav national coach, Dragan Petrovich, in
planning clinics and meets for the country’s up-and-coming crop
of athletes.

YUGOSLAVIA, still saddled
with the expense of an intense de
velopment program and large
armed force, has had little chance
to develop sports facilities. “They
have some very fine coaches, anti
I won’t be helping them much. I
will work primarily with the ath
letes,” Terrill asserts.

The Yugoslavs, with a grow
ing interest in track, are pointing
toward the European Champion
ships to be held in Belgrade in
1962. Obviously thinking in terms
of the 100,000 spectators drawn to
Stanford for the Olympic tryouts
last summer, Petrovich extended
his invitation through the AAWU.
Terrill will also he helping the
Yugoslavs to prepare for the Bal
kan Games to be held in Septem
ber and meets against the French
in Paris and the Czechs in Bel
grade.

Among the athletes he will be training will be Olympic stars
Velisa Mugosa, who has run everything from 1500 meters to 5,000,
and Milija Jocovic, a shot putter. Mugosa has a 3:45 clocking in the
1,500 to his credit which is equivalent to about a four-minute mile.
