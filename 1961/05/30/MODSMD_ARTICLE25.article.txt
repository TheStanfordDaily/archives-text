# Summer Group To Study Drama
## 
### 
As a new approach to the
drama of the future, Stanford’s
Department of Speech and Drama
has created a Summer Workshop
in Contemporary Theatre, which
will start in June.
Set to run for eight weeks, the
workshop is geared to the study
and discussion of new trends in
drama, to training actors, direc
tors and technicians, and to per
forming and producing new plays
written since 1945.
Special courses will be held on
the problem of acting and direct
ing “anti-plays;” others will deal
with production techniques, intel
lectual backgrounds, and modern
theatre history.
In the past, the summer session
of theatre at Stanford lias been a
continuation of the yearly activi
ties. This year', the department
offers a challenging new program
to students.

Two programs have been set up.
In the undergraduate program,
all students must take the 12 unit
block of six courses. Students in
the graduate program may enroll
on a free elective basis with cer
tain minor restrictions.
