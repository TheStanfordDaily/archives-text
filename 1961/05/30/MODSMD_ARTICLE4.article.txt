# Rule by Decree Instituted by Military Junta

### 
SEOUL, Korea (UPI) South
Korea’s ruling military Junta sus
pended the republic’s constitution
last night and said it would rule
entirely by decree until a “basic
law of national reconstruction”
becomes effective.
The Supreme Council for Na
tional Reconstrutcion said the
action was a “temporary meas
ure” and that most provisions of
the constitution would remain in
effect. They would be called “de
crees” however and presumably
subject to quick change.
FORMER laws or decrees of
the old state council (cabinet)
also became decrees of the new
military cabinet, as did decrees
of former ministers.
LI. Gen. Chang Do-Young, chair
man of the Supreme Council, said
earlier yesterday that the consti
tution must be suspended because
“it is impossible to recognize all
the provisions of the present con
stitution” which was born out of
the students’ revolt a year ago.
He said there should be a pro
visional measure to “provide a
legal foundation for the Supreme
Council.”
There was no immediate indi
cation as to how the status of
President Posun Yun would be
affected. Ho is practically a fig
urehead, but it was expected mili
tary leaders to keep him in office
to avoid having to seek new recog
nition from other nations.
IN ANOTHER development the
military government unfroze gov
ernment appropriations and re
turned budget functions to nor
mal. The Ministry of Commerce
said it would ban or severly re
strict import of goods that are
produced in Korea.
The Junta sent birthday greet
ings to President Kennedy, re
affirmed friendship with the
United States, and asked for more
aid.

Gen. Chang told newsmen that
the Junta needs more aid to carry
out its still vague economic pro
gram.
