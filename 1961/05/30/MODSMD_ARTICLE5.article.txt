### KEEM STASSEN 
“There is no meaning in com
promise, reasonableness, or co
existence." former Communist
Frank S. Meyer told a near capa
city audience in Cuhberley Audi
torium yesterday afternoon.
“There are only two alterna
tives in our fight with Commun
ism defeat or victory,” Meyer
said. “We’re not involved in a
battle for men’s minds but a bat
tle for power.”
MEYEB explained that the first
phase of Communism was the
period of “capitalist encircle
ment.” when the strategy of the
Communist was defensive. This
led, according to Meyer, to pri
marily aggressive tactics.
“The second phase of Commun
ist. tactics has begun—the phase
of socialist encirclement,” Meyer
continued. “During this phase the
Communist strategy is offensive.”
“Strategic offensive demands
defensive, gentle, tactics,” Meyer
stated. He believes that coexist
ence and disarmament confer
ences are part of the Communist
attempt to divert our attention
from their battle against the
West.
MEYER prophesied that “the
next Communist step will be the
attack on Berlin. I am willing to
predict that in the next few
months we will see a Western be
trayal of Berlin, like the betrayal
of Budapest and Cuba. I hope my
prediction is wrong,” he said.
“We are faced today with a
powerful enemy whose major aim
is to destroy the United States,”
Meyer stated. This is “a hard
simple fact that the present ad
ministration, like the last one,
does not seem to understand,”
Myer believes.
SEVERAE limes during his
speech some of the audience ap
plauded in approval. The majority
of the questions which he re
ceived, however, were antagonis
tic.
One of the questioners asked
the powerful orator how he could
justify using brute force against
the Communists in Cuba when
this was no belter than the Com
munist tactics. “I think frankly.”
Meyer answered, “that we are
right and they are wrong. Force
is immoral only when it’s used
for the wrong side.”

“The second phase of Commun
ist. tactics has begun—the phase
of socialist encirclement,” Meyer
continued. “During this phase the
Communist strategy is offensive.”
“Strategic offensive demands
defensive, gentle, tactics,” Meyer
stated. He believes that coexist
ence and disarmament confer
ences are part of the Communist
attempt to divert our attention
from their battle against the
West.
MEYER prophesied that “the
next Communist step will be the
attack on Berlin. I am willing to
predict that in the next few
months we will see a Western be
trayal of Berlin, like the betrayal
of Budapest and Cuba. I hope my
prediction is wrong,” he said.
“We are faced today with a
powerful enemy whose major aim
is to destroy the United States,”
Meyer stated. This is “a hard
simple fact that the present ad
ministration, like the last one,
does not seem to understand,”
Myer believes.
SEVERAE limes during his
speech some of the audience ap
plauded in approval. The majority
of the questions which he re
ceived, however, were antagonis
tic.
One of the questioners asked
the powerful orator how he could
justify using brute force against
the Communists in Cuba when
this was no belter than the Com
munist tactics. “I think frankly.”
Meyer answered, “that we are
right and they are wrong. Force
is immoral only when it’s used
for the wrong side.”
