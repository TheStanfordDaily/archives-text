# HR Magazine Presents Perceptive Articles about "Youth In Revolt"
## 
### KEEM STASSEN 
The HR has provided Stanford
with a perceptive and intelligent
account of international student
political thought and action in
this year’s HR magazine, The
Bridge.
The issue is titled ‘‘Youth in
Revolt.” an appropriate title for
a collection of essays on recent
student movements, from the
Hungarian revolution in 1956 to
the San Francisco demonstration
last May.
ESPECIALLY interesting is the
article titled “Then I Saw the
Congo . . . Two Viewpoints on
Independence” because it pre
sents the opposing opinions of
Maina Wanjigi. a graduate stu
dent from Kenya, and Jean-Pierre
Du try, a student from Belgium.
Dutry presents a rational Euro
pean view, blaming premature in
dependence. Lumumba, and Com
munist agitators for the crises.
Jim Maina criticizes Belgian co
lonialization with intensity and
passion.
Maina answers his own ques
tion “What went wrong with the
Congo” by saying “the Belgian
government withheld all forms
of higher education . . . main
tained the colony as a prison
camp . . . and suppressed every

manifestation of Congolese politi
cal life.”
ONE OF THE best articles in
the issue is John R. Searle’s anal
ysis of the reasons “the San
Francisco demonstrations against
the HUAC were a failure.” The
Cal philosophy professor outlines
what he considers the best way
for students to express their po
litical concern.
Eichi Ishii, ASSU scholar from
Tokyo, explains from his experi
ence what ho considers to be the
economic and political difficulties
which led to the riots in Japan
last Spring.

Ishii gives a thought-provoking
presentation of his reasons for
supporting the demonstrations.
He also explains his hope that
Japan be a go-between East and
West.
MIKLOSS Tot lossy, an Hun
garian freedom fighter, and Fran
cis Von Briesen, a graduate stu
dent in art, worked together to
write an excellent article about
the happenings, the meaning, and
the value of the Hungarian stu
dent-worker revolt.
“Youth and the Cuban Revolu
tion,” written by Cuban student
Cesar Jardon, is a chronological
account of Batista’s evil and Cas
tro's good.

The Cuban articles makes up
in idealism what it lacks in criti
cism. The Bridge would bo a more
comprehensive magazine if an
other article on Cuba were also
presented expressing a somewhat
more critical viewpoint.

“YOUTH IN REVOUT” makes
an admirable effort to describe
the American student movement.
An interview with visiting Pro
fessor Cowley brings out the dif
ferences between the post-World
War I “Lost Generation” and our
own generation.
Professors Sanford Dornbusch.
Eleanor Maccoby, and William
McCord discuss student apathy
and lack of focused interest
toward politics and international
affairs.
Howard Richards, a Stanford
law student, praises the student
civil rights activities, and ex
presses his opinion of what he
terms “quasi-political activities”
such as Political Union’s FOCUS
program.
A letter from the New Or
leans Chairman of CORE is also
part of the attempt to describe
American “Youth in Revolt.”
THE BRIDGE will be sold to
day and tomorrow from 9 to 12
and 1 to 4 at Engineering Cor
ner, the Post Office, and the Cel
lar. It is well worth the 50 cents
it costs.
