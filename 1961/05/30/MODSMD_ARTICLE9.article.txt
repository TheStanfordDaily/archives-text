# Martial Law Lifted in Ala.; Governor Praises Guard
## Robert Kennedy Asks ICC Ban On Interstate Bus Segregation 
### 
MONTGOMERY, Ala.—(UPl) —Martial rule ended at midnight
last night and National Guardsmen were withdrawn from this Deep-
South capital shaken by race rioting nine days ago.
Gov. John Patterson, in proclaiming an end to partial military rule
yesterday, praised the Guard for "restoring public confidence in law

and order.” He expressed confi
dance there woull be no recur
rence of the bloody fighting which
forced him to order out the guard
May 21.
At Jackson, Miss., authorities
put “Freedom Riders” to work on
a prison farm today and prepared
to try 17 others for attempting
to break segregation barriers at
a Jackson bus terminal.

PATTERSON credited the Na
tional Guard with quelling “an
explosive situation dangerous to
all citizens.” Ho said the guard
showed “the world that this state
can and will continue to maintain
law and order without the aid of
federal forces.”

Patterson called the guard out
Sunday night, May 21. when a
mob of whites, throwing rocks
and swinging clubs, directed its
anger at Negroes meeting at a
Baptist church and at U.S. mar
shals deployed in the area. The
marshals were called out by Atty.
Gen. Kennedy in Washington fol
lowing rioting at the Montgomery
Greyhound bus terminal the pre
vious daj’ when a load of “Free
dom Riders” arrived.

Meanwhile 1 n Washington,
Atty. Gen. Robert F. Kennedy
asked the Interstate Commerce
Commission to issue regulations
banning segregation in interstate
bus transportation and terminal
facilities, including waiting rooms,
rest rooms and restaurants.

The federal government at the
same time opened hearings into
its call for an injunction which
would restrain top Montgomery
and Birmingham, Ala., law en
forcement officials and others,
notably Ku Klux Klan members,
from interfering with interstate
bus travel.

Patterson said local agencies
should be able to preserve order,
but, he said, “If it becomes neces
sary to call upon the national
guard again, some 200 troops here
in Montgomery will be immediate
ly available.” Additionally, he
said. 100 more guardsmen can be
brought into Montgomery “or al
most any other trouble spot” in
the state.

THE governor, in an obvious
reference to “Freedom Riders”
whose arrival at a bus terminal
here May 20 touched off violence,
called upon "outside agitators” to
stay at home “and mind their own
business.”

“I further call on the U.S. at
torney general and the U.S. gov
ernment to stop encouraging
those Red-front agitators to come
here,” Patterson said.

At Jackson, Miss., authorities
put 10 “Freedom Riders” to work
at aprison farm and later convist
ed 17 others on breach of the
peace charges from their attempt
to break segregation barriers at
a Jackson bus terminal. Three
others, including one of the four
white persons Involved, were re
leased after posting appeal bonds.

Those convicted yesterday went
to jail on 60-day sentences rather
than pay fines of $200 each.
Five Negroes, hold in jail here
since a Thursday attempt to inte
grate a bus terminal, were re
leased tonight after posting $1,000
bond each on charges of breach
of the peace and conspiracy to
breach the peace.
They wore the Rev. Ralph Aber
nathy of Montgomery, the Rev.
Wyatt Toe Walker of Atlanta,
Bernard Lee of Atlanta, and Clyde
Carter and Charles Jones, both
students at Johnson C. Smith Col
lege. Charlotte, N.C.
The five were released shortly
befoie the regular monthly meet
ing of the Montgomery Improve
ment Association, a Negro inte
gration group. Six others arrested
with them, including four white
educators, had been freed earlier.
