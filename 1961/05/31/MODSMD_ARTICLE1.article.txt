# Reds Infiltrate Fair Play for Cuba Hierarchy
## 
### LOUIS CASSELS United Press International 
WASHINGTON A Communist-infiltrated
organization called the “Fair Play for Cuba
Committee” t FPCC) is actively recruiting mem
bers in many parts of the United States, especi
ally on college campuses.
The pro-Castro group now claims a member
ship of about 7,000, with chapters in 23 cities
and 37 colleges.
The FPCC plays on traditional American
sympathy for the underdog. It depicts Fidel
Castro as a misrepresented patriot who is being
“bullied” by a big neighbor.
The FPCC is heavily infiltrated by Com
munists, although all members are by no means
Communists. It is increasingly active on Cas
tro’s behalf.
On April 15, when the United Nations was

debating a Cuban charge of “aggression”
against the United States, a crowd of about 300
demonstrators marched outside the UN building
waving anti-American placards and shouting,
“Cuba, si; Yankee, no!”
THIS demonstration was organized by the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
The FPCC's orientation is also clear in its
propaganda, which is distributed to members
through a newsletter and other literature, and
to the general public via occasional paid news
paper advertisements. It consistently blames the
United States for friction with the Castro re
gime. and rarely finds fault with anything that
Castro has done, including his mass executions.
But it is not necessary to rely on such cir
cumstantial evidence to see Communist hands
in the FPCC’s affairs. There is abundant docu
mentary proof that the committee has been in-

filtrated by members of not one, but two, Com
munist organizations.

ONE IS the regular Communist Party,
U.S.A. The other, less well known to the public,
is the Socialist Workers Party. The latter is a
dissident Communist group that was formed by
followers of Leon Trotsky after he was expelled
from Russia. It has no ties with the Kremlin
and in the past has been a bitter enemy of the
Communist Party.
The fact that these long-antagonistic Com
munist factions have begun to work together
in the FPCC is extremely interesting to authori
ties who keep a close watch on Red activities
in America. It suggests the possibility that they
may bo moving toward a united front.
THE FPCC was organized more than a year
ago, by Robert Bruce Taber, a former television
newsman who became a Castro supporter dur

ing the early days of the Cuban Revolution
while the bearded rebels were holed up in the
mountains of Oriente Province.

An FBI report submitted to the Senate In
ternal Security Subcommittee shows that Taber
was arrested in Ohio in 1939, and entered a plea
of guilty to charges of armed robbery, auto lar
ceny and kidnaping. He was sentenced to 30
years in prison, but was released on parole
in 1942.

Tabor is now in Cuba, wielding sword and
pen for Castro. During the April invasion at
tempt by anti-Castro forces, he was photo
graphed wearing the uniform of the Castro
militia. He also is reported to be working for
“Revolucion,” official organ of the Castro
regime.

IN LOS ANGELES, the FPCC chapter is
headed by Martin Hall. Benjamin Gitlow, former

Communist Party leader, has described Hall as
a Communist of long standing.
Steve Roberts, West Coast representative of
the FPCC, is a well-known Trotskyite who was
Socialist Workers Party candidate for governor
of California in 1946.

A1 Saxton, Chairman of the FPCC Chapter
in San Francisco, was a member of the Com
munist Party from 1944 to 1946, according to
testimony given to the House Committee on
Un-American Activities by Ernest L. Seymour,
admitted former Communist. As late as 1919,
Saxton was listed as a faculty member of the
California Labor School, cited by the Attorney
General as a subversive Communist organiza
tion.

AN FPCC chapter was organized in Seattle,
Wash., early this year by Jack William Wright,
who was the Socialist Workers Party candidate
for governor of the state of Washington in 1960,
WASHINGTON A Communist-infiltrated
organization called the “Fair Play for Cuba
Committee” t FPCC) is actively recruiting mem
bers in many parts of the United States, especi
ally on college campuses.
The pro-Castro group now claims a member
ship of about 7,000, with chapters in 23 cities
and 37 colleges.
The FPCC plays on traditional American
sympathy for the underdog. It depicts Fidel
Castro as a misrepresented patriot who is being
“bullied” by a big neighbor.
The FPCC is heavily infiltrated by Com
munists, although all members are by no means
Communists. It is increasingly active on Cas
tro’s behalf.
On April 15, when the United Nations was

debating a Cuban charge of “aggression”
against the United States, a crowd of about 300
demonstrators marched outside the UN building
waving anti-American placards and shouting,
“Cuba, si; Yankee, no!”
THIS demonstration was organized by the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
The FPCC's orientation is also clear in its
propaganda, which is distributed to members
through a newsletter and other literature, and
to the general public via occasional paid news
paper advertisements. It consistently blames the
United States for friction with the Castro re
gime. and rarely finds fault with anything that
Castro has done, including his mass executions.
But it is not necessary to rely on such cir
cumstantial evidence to see Communist hands
in the FPCC’s affairs. There is abundant docu
mentary proof that the committee has been in-

filtrated by members of not one, but two, Com
munist organizations.

ONE IS the regular Communist Party,
U.S.A. The other, less well known to the public,
is the Socialist Workers Party. The latter is a
dissident Communist group that was formed by
followers of Leon Trotsky after he was expelled
from Russia. It has no ties with the Kremlin
and in the past has been a bitter enemy of the
Communist Party.
The fact that these long-antagonistic Com
munist factions have begun to work together
in the FPCC is extremely interesting to authori
ties who keep a close watch on Red activities
in America. It suggests the possibility that they
may bo moving toward a united front.
THE FPCC was organized more than a year
ago, by Robert Bruce Taber, a former television
newsman who became a Castro supporter dur

ing the early days of the Cuban Revolution
while the bearded rebels were holed up in the
mountains of Oriente Province.

An FBI report submitted to the Senate In
ternal Security Subcommittee shows that Taber
was arrested in Ohio in 1939, and entered a plea
of guilty to charges of armed robbery, auto lar
ceny and kidnaping. He was sentenced to 30
years in prison, but was released on parole
in 1942.

Tabor is now in Cuba, wielding sword and
pen for Castro. During the April invasion at
tempt by anti-Castro forces, he was photo
graphed wearing the uniform of the Castro
militia. He also is reported to be working for
“Revolucion,” official organ of the Castro
regime.

IN LOS ANGELES, the FPCC chapter is
headed by Martin Hall. Benjamin Gitlow, former

Communist Party leader, has described Hall as
a Communist of long standing.
Steve Roberts, West Coast representative of
the FPCC, is a well-known Trotskyite who was
Socialist Workers Party candidate for governor
of California in 1946.

A1 Saxton, Chairman of the FPCC Chapter
in San Francisco, was a member of the Com
munist Party from 1944 to 1946, according to
testimony given to the House Committee on
Un-American Activities by Ernest L. Seymour,
admitted former Communist. As late as 1919,
Saxton was listed as a faculty member of the
California Labor School, cited by the Attorney
General as a subversive Communist organiza
