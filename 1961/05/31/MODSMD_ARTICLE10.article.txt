# Mississippi Arrests 25 'Freedom Riders’ Traveling by Train
## 
### 
JACKSON. Miss. (UP!) A
new group of freedom riders en
tered Jackson yesterday, this time
by train, and was promptly ar
rested for trying to integrate the
white waiting room of the Illinois
Central station.
In contrast to scones recently
at Birmingham, Anniston and
Montgomery, Ala., where crowds
of angry whites greeted “free
dom riders,” the scene yesterday
was almost gay,
IT WAS the first known “free
dom ride” aboard a train and
raised the number of arrests of
the integrationists in Jackson the
past week to 32. All those arrested
have been charged with breach of
the peace.
The group was tried in city
court, just five hours after their
arrest, and given suspended 60-
day jail sentences and $2OO fines.
(Defense attorneys said the group
| preferred to remain in jail rather
(than pay fines. They said there
were no immediate plans for ap
peal.
THRKK WITNESSES invoked
the fifth amendment as the gov
ernment sought to link the Ku
Klux Klan with the burning of
I a bus carrying “freedom riders”
[ near Anniston, Ala., on May 14.
In Washington, the FBI con
| firmed it is investigating a report
! that one of a group of imprisoned
I riders taken briefly to a county
I work camp was beaten there.
IN MONTGOMERY, Ala., the
j hearing into a federal request for
an injunction restraining certain
Montgomery and Birmingham,
Ala., city officials from interfer
ing with interstate bus travel,
went into its second day.
