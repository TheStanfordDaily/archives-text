# Eulau Finds Michener's New Report Depressing
## 
### HEINZ EULAU 
Report of the County Chairman
By James A. Mlehener. New
York: Bandoin House 10(51. $3.0!).
James Michener, novelist, is a
good man, a sensitive observer,
a devoted liberal and, what really
counts, a stout-hearted Democrat.
That’s why I’m all for him. But,
why he wrote this hook and why
anybody else should read it es
capes me. For what one learns
from reading the book is that
James Michener, novelist, is a
good man, a sensitive observer, a
devoted liberal and a stout-heart
ed Democrat.
Let me qualify my rather rash
first paragraph by saying that,
as amusement, this book isn’t too
bad. But, then, who wants politics
to be amusing, especially if it
takes 300 pages of reading, if one
can get the same, similar or better
fare for only three bucks from
Mort Sahl at the hungry i? O.K.
There are some delightful politi
cal anecdotes here. And there are
some wonderful personality
sketches—a novelist’s, not a psy
chiatrist’s—of all kinds of odd
characters in the Kennedy ring
of our national campaign circus.
* * *
As a baseball fan, I w r as rather
pleased to find out that Stan Mu
sial, the slugger, gave “unforget
table” political speeches for Sen
ator Kennedy, such as this gem:
"Tonight I’m not here to play
baseball. I’m here to ask you to
vote for Senator John F. Ken
nedy.” Comments Mr. Michener:
“More shouting and Stan
would sit down. I suspect he
influenced more votes than
any of the rest of us, for he
spoke to men who could not
otherwise be touched. He was
the perpetual youth, the boy
hood hero, the clean-cut ath
lete . . . He was the champ,
Stan the Man, and if a sena
tor from Massachusetts was

good enough for Stan, he was
good enough for them.”
And there was Angie Dickinson,
a Hollywood glamour girl—“a
strikingly beautiful young wom
an with golden blond hair, dark
eyes and a truly gamin manner.”
I’m not sure what a “gamin man
ner” is, and I must confess that I
had not heard of Angie before
reading about her, and 1 shall cer
tainly make it a point to see her
soon to find out. Anyway, Angie’s
“sole responsibility was to step
off at each stop looking positively
delicious, but she had to accom
plish this with no sleep, improper
food, no dressing room, and not
even a place where she could
stretch out for a nap.” The rest
is left up to the imagination.

Well, enough of that. Fortun
ately, for Senator Kennedy and
the reader, Mr. Michener portrays
other, politically somewhat more
relevant people—Governor Law
rence of Pennsylvania. Sam
Thompson (“the only man you’ll
meet who has a bottle of whiskey
named after him”) of Bucks
County, sundry others and, yes
indeed, “Artie” (as Angie called
him) Schlesinger, “one of the
most powerful brains of the Ken
nedy team ...” (as if we didn’t
know!) It fell to Schlesinger, re
ports Mr. M., “to give the talks
that established the grave theme
of our meetings, that America
faced a real choice between the
Democrats and the Republicans.”
Alas, I’m happy to report, there
fore, that “Artie” did this “with
precision,” and that “it was a
constant privilege for me (Mich
ener, not this reviewer) to hear
Schlesinger, for I had once
studied with his father at Har
vard ... I often wondered what
the austere old man would have
thought if he could have heard
little Angie Dickinson cooing,
‘Artie, you were a sensation to

night. Nobody could understand a
damned word you said, but you
said it so impressively.’ ” Not hav
ing sat at the old man’s feet but
having known him, I know
damned well what he would have
thought!
And so goes Mr. Michener’s po
litical report. I forgot to say that
what I’m reporting is Mr. M.’s
story of a “barnstorming tour”
arranged by the national “Citizens
for Kennedy” which carried our
author “in the waning days
of the campaign, w r hen it was
obvious that I could accomplish
no more in Bucks County”— into
Michigan, Illinois, Nebraska, etc.
etc. I don’t know how Soapy Wil
liams or Boss Daley felt about the
invasion, but I must report that
Mr. Michener did spend most of
the campaign in Bucks County
(with, from what I can make out,
frequent trips into the less civiliz
ed parts of Pennsylvania, New
York and Connecticut). But which
also forces me to indicate that the
title of this book, Report of the
County Chairman, is slightly mis
leading. I never heard of a “coun
ty chairman” who would leave his
county “in the waning days of the
campaign,” and Mr. Michener’s
feat was possible only because he
really wasn't a “county chair
man.” I’ll give his publisher, Ben
nett Cerf, credit for this one.
Michener was head of the Bucks
County “Citizens for Kennedy,”
and that’s something quite differ
ent from being the county chair
man.

So, what this book is mainly
about is the speaking engage
ments of a prominent writer who
felt impelled, for honorable and
convincing reasons, to work for
Senator Kennedy, his emotional
and intellectual ups and downs as
the campaign proceeded, and, at
times, some of the organizational,
but always spectacular, work of
the “Citizens for Kennedy.” There
is little here about what really
goes on at the grassroots of polit
ical organization and campaign
ing, and while fact and fiction are
quite distinguishable, there is as
much fiction as fact, and the
facts are loss interesting than the
fiction. In fact, victory or defeat,
in Mr. M.’s political world, seem
to be primarily matters of chance
events, “tricks of history”—like
Khrushchev’s taking off his shoe
in the United Nations which edged
politics off the front pages. Plus
a bit of pseudo-sociology about
suburbia and its denizens.
* * *
All in all, then, this is not a
book about what politics is all
about. I find this very literary
report a rather depressing saga
of political naivete. And, by the
way, “we” lost Bucks County by
more than 10,000 votes, Mr. Mich
ener’s own precinct by 178 to 115.
Maybe Mr. M. should have stayed
home to convert the 32 voters who
could have given him a local vic
tory.
I should say, in conclusion, that
the most enlightening parts of
the book describe the vitriolic an
ti-Catholic campaign waged by
bigoted Protesants in Bucks Coun
ty and elsewhere. Adlai Steven
son is credited with this post
mortem on the abortive Peale-
Poling afair in the early days of
the campaign: “In this campaign
it seems as if each party has a
patron saint. Personally I must
admit that I find St. Paul appeal
ing and St. Peale appalling.” And
that’s why Adlai isn’t President.
