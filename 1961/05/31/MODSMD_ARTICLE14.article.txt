# Professor Sees Labour Party Making Changes
## 
### RICHARD LYMAN 
That long-suffering political in
valid, the British Labour Party,
may be starting back towards
health, if recent indications can be
trusted. No one familiar with La
bour’s capacity for self destruc
tion is counting on it yet, how
ever. Defeated, by ever increasing
margins, in the last three General
Elections (1951, ’55 and 59), the
Party has seemed to be suffering
from that worst of all diseases
for a party of progress, hardening
of the political arteries. The symp
toms are several.
The Party’s program, with its
emphasis on curbing the rich and
aiding the downtrodden, has di
minishing appeal in a society al
ready well off and getting more
so. Ironically, Labour may be said
to have worked itself out of a job,
when in power from 1945 to 1951,
by enacting such crucial (and
popular) welfare measures as the
National Health Service. All that
was left to the Party then Was to
promise more of the same, seldom
a winning formula for a reform
party.
In structure, too, what was once
an advantage for Labour now
threatens to become a handicap.
The trade unions provide much of
the Party’s revenue and most of
its membership; by their “block
votes” they dominate the annual
Party Conference. This trade
union link has been a source of
strength. Whereas the German
trade unions ran for cover when
Hitler came to power, cutting
their lies with the Social Demo
cratic politicians, the British
unions stood by Labour in the
crisis of 1931, when the Party lost
its top leaders and saw its Parlia
mentary strength cut from 289
seats to 46. As long as the unions
remained loyal it seemed that La
bour could survive anything.

But today the unions are widely
unpopular among the general
public. Tied to them, Labour
■seems out of place in an affluent,
increasingly white collar Britain.
Each time an unofficial strike hits
the headlines. Labour politicians
wince. Britain loses only about
one man-day by strikes for every
seven lost in the United States,
but this does not deter British
newspapers from playing up each
new incident as if it were the pre
lude to a total breakdown of the
nation’s economy.

As if these difficulties were
not enough, Labour has been
riven by internal squabbles. This
is nothing new; even at the height
of the Party’s power there were
bitter rivalries and disagreements
behind the facade of Cabinet
unity. But since 1959 Labour’s in
ternal feuding has become almost
a national joke. Labour M.P.s ; of
differing factions have stalked
the halls of Westminster, refusing
to speak to one another; socialist
periodicals snap and snarl at each
other with uninhibited fury; and
the late Aneuran Sevan's intima
tion that Hugh Gaitskell was “a
dessicated calculating machine”
seems almost an affectionate ac
colade compared with the epithets
now flying about the Party.

The main issues in this strug
gle, aside from personalities, have
been two: the Party’s attitude
towards further nationalization of
industry, and its defence policy.
Gaitskell, an Oxford educated
economist and the Party Leader
since 1955, has worked hard,
though not always tactfully, to
make Labour recognize the
changes which the nation and the
world have undergone since 1945,
and remodel its outlook accord
ingly. In particular, he urged re
vision of the Party’s sweeping
commitment, dating from 1918, to
“common ownership of the means
of production.” This Clause Four,
Gaitskell argued, was a millstone
around Labour’s neck; opinion
polls showed that most voters

were either indifferent or actively
opposed to public ownership. It
had no doubt been necessary in
such cases as coal and railways;
not even the Tories dared dena
tionalize them. But Britain’s press
ing economic problems today con
cern her relationship with the
European Common Market, and
the need to expand the export
trade which is her livelihood; few
Britishers believe that more na
tionalization would he much help
towards solving questions such as
these.

Nevertheless, to many Labour
stalwarts Clause Four was the
Ark of the socialist Covenant.
Gaitskell’s attempt to tamper
with it aroused their darkest
fears: might not Labour succumb
to creeping capitalism? The Lead
er was accused of placing party
policy at the mercy of public
opinion polls. At Blackpool in
1959, in his last major speech,
Bevan poured scorn on the afflu
ent society as a mere temporary
phenomenon. Far better, some
suggested, that Labour should
wait in the wings for decades, if
necessary, until some national or
international disaster summons
it on stage and gives it power,
than that it should seek populari
ty at the cost of its socialist prin
ciples. Even many moderates
balked at removing Clause Four,
and Mr. Gaitskell had to climb
down.
On nationalization, Gaitskell
challenged the Left, and lost. On
the defence issue, the challenge
came from the Left, and particu
larly from the supporters of uni
lateral nuclear disarmament for
Britain. The official leadership,
and the majority of Labour M.P.s,
oppose unilateralism and uphold
the necessity of maintaining Brit
ain’s full partnership in NATO,
until such time as agreement can
be reached on multilateral disar
mament. At last year’s Party Con
ference, the unilateralists tri
umphed aided by assiduous poli
ticking within the trade union.
This put the Gaitskcllites in the
uncomfortable position of having
to reject, in practice, the majority
decision of the Conference. Even
friendly observers began to ask
how long Gaitskell could retain
the Leadership in the face of such
defeats. And in by-elections dur
ing the past year, the Liberals
made substantial gains at La
bour’s expense. The spectre, not
merely of further losses, but of
outright disappearance as a major
party began to haunt the more
sensitive Labour souls.
i * •* *
More recently, however, the fact
that most ordinary voters in Brit
ain are ndt unilateralists, together
with some noticeable weakening
of the Macmillan Government,
has reversed the trend, temporari
ly at least, and given Mr. Gaitskell
a breathing space and a modicum
of hope. Several important trade
unions have reconsidered their
stand on defence, and the vote at
the next Party Conference is al
most certain to go against the
unilateralists. The moderates in
the Party, traditionally less as
sertive and articulate than the
Left, have spoken up and counter
organized to good effect. A good
many of the younger Parliamen
tary candidates, more aware of
the public mood and less attached
to old-time socialist slogans than
some of their elders, have worked
hard for Gaitskell. Labour fared
less badly than expected in recent
local elections.

But the Pai'ty has still to over
come its associations in the popu
lar mind with the shortages and
annoying restrictions of the early
post-war period; it has still to put
forth suggestions for improving
the welfare state that have broad
appeal to the voters, and do not
merely sound like expensive hand
outs to one or another special in
terest. Above all, it must over
come the handicap of Britain’s in
grained conservatism, with a
small “c”; as the struggle over
nationalization has shown, even
Leftists in Britain resist, changes
of outlook. Yet much depends on
Labour’s ability to move with the
times, and to carry the country
with it. For Britain, stability and
the preservation of a great tradi
tion are not enough. Imagination,
fresh energies, and flair are now
the crucial needs. It is Labour's
formidable task to provide them.
