# Seek Course Continuity In Undergrad Program
## 
### PHILIP H. RHINELANDER 
The total academic program of
the average undergraduate at
Stanford today consists of a col
lection of individual courses se
lected according to certain pre
scribed rules and adding up to a
number of prescribed credit units.
The requirement that every stu
dent choose a major field guaran
tees that a certain number of his
courses will he concentrated in a
single area, and the General
Studies program insures that the
total list of courses will have a
certain spread in areas outside the
field of concentration. However,
there is at present little or no in
centive for the average under
graduate, except insofar as the
logic of a particular discipline or
particular course sequence hap
pens to require it, to carry for
ward what he learns in one course
to his other courses, or to give an
organic unity to his program as
a whole. Once a particular course
has been taken and passed, it is
likely to become finished business,
—with no lasting significance be
yond grade points earned there
by toward graduation.

The atomistic character of the
course structure tends to be ag
gravated by the fact that there
are presently very few courses
which extend beyond a single
quarter. Thus, the student passes
quickly through a large number
of short, separate, and largely
self-contained courses. Assuming
an average of four or five courses
per quarter, the ordinary student
will have taken from 48 to GO dif
ferent courses in a normal four
year undergraduate career.

This system has a number of
unfortunate consequences:
1) It encourages the student in
the already prevalent belief that
education consists simply in tak
ing and passing a number of
courses.

2) It encourages the student to
put the primary emphasis, not on
learning as such, but on obtain
ing good grades i n individual
courses. The higher the grade in
each course the more academic
credit thereby earned. And aca
demic credit is what counts for
graduation or entry to graduate
school.

3) It provides no incentive for
critical reflection by the student
on the significance of what he is
learning or on the relation which
the separate parts of his program,
or the separate courses, bear to
one another. In other words, it
encourages the student to be con
tent not to see the woods for the
trees. If our students are to be
come intellectually responsible
men and women, rather than men
and women with a superficial
smattering of learned informa
tion, this tendency must be cor
rected.

4) It encourages the belief that
the pursuit of knowledge is not
a journey of systematic explora
tion into new territory undertak
en by students in cooperation with
one another, but a kind of intel
lectual decathlon in which each
contestant seeks to beat out his
competitors in as many events as
possible.

What we aim at is an eventual
readjustment along the following
lines, which we hope will be adopt
ed by the,various departments in
Humanities and Social Sciences,
together with those departments
in the Mathematical and Natural
Sciences which consider the pro
gram appropriate:
I) Concentration requirements
in each area should be stated, not
in terms of particular courses to
be taken, but; in terms of topics,
or groups of topics, to be mas
tered.

2) In addition to regular course
examinations every undergradu
ate will be required to pass a gen
eral examination in his senior
year designed to test his grasp of
his major field as a whole. Pass
ing such an examination will be
a condition of graduation and the
studpnt’s performance will ma
terially affect his final standing.
The general examinations would
be set by the departments or com
mittees concerned.

3) Students would choose
courses in their field of concentra
tion, in consultation with their de
partmental advisers, with a view
to covering the topics prescribed
for the general examination. How
ever, if a student wished to work
up a topic independently without
taking a course he would be en
couraged to do so.
4) Every student in the top one
third of his or her class (or a
larger proportion, if finances per
mit) would be given an oppor
tunity to become a candidate for
honors. Every honors candidate
would (a) submit a senior honors
thesis on some special research
topic in addition to the general
examination, and (h) take a sub
stantial amount of independent
study, directed reading, or tutori
al with a particular member of
the faculty in his department of
concentration, who would also be
his departmental adviser. Such
work might be done individually
or in small groups meeting regu
larly with the faculty member.
The aim of such independent
study would be to supplement the
formal courses taken and to pur
sue special topics of investigation
for preparation of the honors the
sis.

Five years ago there was one
Honors Program in the School of
Humanities and Sciences. Today
thirteen are offerer!. Ten depart
ments Anthropology, Biology,
Economics. History, Music, Phi
losophy, Physics, Political Sci
ence, Psychology and Sociology—
offer rigorous programs designed
to fit the interests and capabili
ties of the superior Stanford stu
dent. Others are making similar
plans. Usually, the departments
require a sequence of seminars,
designed particularly for the su
perior student, which culminate
in a thesis or individual research
project and a comprehensive ex
amination.

In addition to the departmental
programs three interdisciplinary
programs are offered. An honors
sequence in the behavioral sci
ences and quantitative methods
is directed to those students who
wish to combine an acquaintance
with basic mathematical tech
niques with a thorough education
in a particular social science. An
honors program in social thought
and institutions was created for
students whose interests cut
across the usual disciplinary
boundaries and who have a par
ticular concern with the more
philosophical aspects of these sub
jects. The Humanities program,
the oldest of all of the honors cur
ricula, offers students a unified
study of various literary and ar
tistic issues.

In the fall of 1960, 216 students,
some 9'; of declared undergradu
ate majors in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, actively
participated in one of the various
honors programs. They are guid
ed by 81 faculty members who
offer seminars or devote their
time to the close supervision of
the advanced students’ theses.
We should like to increase the stu
dent participation to 30' o or 40T'o
in view of the improved caliber of
students.

In addition to its honors pro
gram, the Philosophy Department
is experimenting with a tutorial
program for all its undergraduate
majors. This program, originated
in 1959, allows the Philosophy stu
dent in junior year to study a ma
jor philosophical works under the
direction of the Philosophy fac
ulty, either individually or in a
tutorial group of about three. In
the senior year, the better stu
dents continue their tutorial and
integrate it into the Philosophy
honors cuiTiculum.

The success of the experimental
program in Philosophy is shown
by a spectacular increase in the
number of current undergraduate
concentrators in Philosophy, as
follows: 1957-58, 36; 1958-59, 42;
1959-69. 37; 1960-61, 68, fall quar
ter), 75, (winter quarter).
These figures show clearly the
extent to which our students are

attracted by a revised program of
the sort described above, which
includes tutorial instruction for

all students.
The main costs entailed by such
a system would be for additional
staff to perform three functions;
(1) to give independent study or
small-group tutorial to concentra
tors, including all honors candi
dates and non-honors candidates
desiring it, (2) to set and correct
the general examinations for all
students, and (3) to direct and
read undergraduate honors the
ses. Since the first of these pur
poses is the most central and time
consuming the other two being
largely Incidental, we may assume
in estimating costs that a staff
sufficient to perform the tutorial
function would also be sufficient
to handle the others.

This is admittedly expensive
education, but the effect, we be
lieve. would be to place Stanford
in the lead among major universi
ties with respect to undergradu
ate instruction.
