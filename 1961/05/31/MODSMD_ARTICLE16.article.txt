## Kmetovic Coach of the Year 
### ROY SCHMIDT 
Varsity Rugby Coach Pete
Kmetovic was selected “Coach of
the Year” by Daily sports scribes
in view of his team’s champion
ships in the Monterey Tourna
ment and the Northern Califor
nia Rugby Union this year.
Posting a 15-1 seasonal mark,
Kmetovic’s squad was the first
college team to beat the Califor
nia Bears since 1953 when the
Indians last turned the trick. The
victory ended a string of 1(> losses
to the Bears, including one earlier
in the year.
HAVING soundly wrapped up
the league crown, the Indians
swept into the Monterey Tourney
and won four straight, defeating
USC in the finals 6-3 for the title.
For Kmetovic it was a personal
triumph, as ho molded the re-

turnees from last year’s team in
to a strong defensive unit that
produced six shutouts over the
16-game season.
The offense, sparked by North
ern California All Stars Rich Mc-
Millan, Tom McManus and Kyrk
Reid was an equa 11 y lethal
weapon.
KMETOVIC, long a favorite
among Stanford sports fans, was
a member of the famous WOW
boys of the 1940 Clark Shaugh
nessy era. He joined quarterback
Frank Albert, right halfback
Hugh Gallarneau, and fullback
Norm Standlee in one of the most
explosive backfields in Stanford
history.
Tlic Indians ripped off nine
straight victories over conference
opponents that year and heartily
accepted tlie Rose Bowl bid to
meet powerful Nebraska. That
cold, crisp New Years Day was
one to remember for Kmetovic,
for he turned in one of the most
spectacular runs in Bowl history,
a 39-yard jaunt through the en
tire Cornhusker team to ice the
21-13 Card victory.
Kmetovic later joined the Stan
ford coaching staff and has assist
ed football coach Jack Curtice in
addition to his rugby chores.
