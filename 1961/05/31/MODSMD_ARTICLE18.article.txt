# SC UPSET ALSO OUTSTANDING
## Rugby Win—Top Thrill 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Thrills wore few and far be
tween on the Stanford sports
scene this year, but a few of the
top ones come readily to mind.
Everyone remembers the “per
fect rooting section,” that Stan
ford put on display in the USC
football game, following a tongue
lashing by Prince Lightfoot and
frosh football player Mike Walsh.

OF LESS reknown is the Stan
ford baseball victory over USC,
a team rated No. 1 in the nation
and the West Coast representa
tive in the NCAA baseball play
offs. A rally featuring extra base
hitting by John Hurlbut, picture
pretty outfielding by Hal Schutz
man, and outstanding relief pitch
ing by Dan-ell Sutherland and
Earl Russell, plus a near-riot,
highlighted the game.
Another top sports thrill was
Stanford’s first soccer win over
USE in 15 years. 2-0. Tight de
fensive play by Bernie Knaggs,
Jan Achenbach, and Dan Farth
ing completely stifled the vaunt
ed USE attack. Goals by Adam
Bianchi and Knaggs decided the
contest.

However, the top vote-getter in
the Daily Sportstaff poll was the
Stanford rugby victory over the
University of California, a vic
tory which placed the Stanford
rugby team at the top of the
national ratings; a place which
Cal had occupied for who knows
how long up to this year.
THE STANFORD triumph
avenged an earlier 6-5 defeat, and
gave the Indians the “Scrum
Axe.’’ a perpetual trophy cre
ated by Timm Williams, “Prince
Lightfoot,” and awarded by the
Oakland Tribune.

To emerge with the win Stan
ford had to make up a 3-0 half
time deficit. California had been
awarded seven penalty kicks in
the first half, some from dis

tances of over 50 yards. Luckily
for Stanford, Cal hooter John
Harrison missed all but one.
Stanford broke ahead early in
the second half on the strength
of Kyrk Reid’s first of two 30-
yard penalty kicks to tie it at 3-3,
and went ahead when Stan Lind
skog made a 30-yard try, giving
Stanford a 6-3 advantage.
STANFORD’S Reid again
scored with his second penalty
kick, but Cal, bouncing back like
the champions they almost were,
came within three at 9-6 with
two minutes left.

The remainder of the game was
played on Stanford’s five-yard
line as Cal had five chances to
put across the tying try, but each
time scrums were called on the
five-yard line, the hefty Stan
ford fotwards led by Reid and
John Thomas kept the Bears out
of scoring territory.
Stanford Coach Pete Kmetovic
singled out Reid, Linds k o g,
Thomas, and Steve Purcell as the
standouts in Stanford's finest
sports hour this year.
