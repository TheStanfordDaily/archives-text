"Positive neutrality is a tool to
accomplish the aims of Arab na
tionalism,” declared the Israeli j
chief of army intelligence Major |
General Yeohashafat Harkabi last i
evening in his Tuesday Evening [
Series speech entitled “Africa—
Positive Neutralism in Action.” |
“In recent years there has de-1
veloped a clash between Israel j
and positive neutralism in Africa, j
Egypt wants leadership in Africa,
and to be the center of Arab, Is
lamic and African circles” he ex-1
plained.
ISRAEL’S activity in Africa is
technical, he said, and pointed out j
that there are 300 Israelis in Af- j
rica and 430 African trainees in
Israel. The Egyptian activity is
not technical, but political, ho
stated and “The Egyptians try to
oust our technicians from Af- j
rica.”
To the Egyptians “Egypt is the
gate to Africa,” Harkabi said, and
therefore considers herself the I
leader and intermediary between j
Africa and civilization.
Nasser’s positive neutrality and
Nehru’s neutrality are not the |
same, he explained. Positive neu- j
trality depends on balancing the j
two major powers against one j
another and playing one another
off. "It thrives on the cold war. j
and attempts to exploit it,” ho j
said, while neutralism tries to I
soften the cold war.
POSITIVE neutralism is "dy
namic and interventionist.” Har
kabi continued. If a small country
is interventionist it will be forced
to join one of the big power blocs,
he said. “Nassar’s positive neu
trality is always directed against
the West.”
In discussing the differences
between Soviet and Communist
penetration he said that Soviet
penetration does not affect in
ternal policy. “An anti-commun
ist country can be pro-Soviet.”
because of the country’s animosi
ty to the West stemming from
political and historical factors.
"Many Americans do not realize
the depth of this animosity.”
