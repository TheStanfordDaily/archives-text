# Lawson Out At UCLA
## 
### 
Ron Lawson, UCLA basketball
star, quit school late Monday
after he admitted being ap
proached by gamblers.
It was another announcement
in a growing list of the round
ball fixes and attempted bribes
that went unreported.
WILBUR JOHNS, director of
athletics at UCLA, said that Law
son voluntarily quit the campus
for failing to report immediately
to his coaches that ho was ap
proached by a contact man for
the gamblers.
Lawson, from Nashville. Term.,
appeared before the New York
Grand Jury last week in connec
tion with the investigation into
point shaving by college basket
ball players.
“The only wrong thing J did
was failing to report the ap
proach.
“Why I didn’t report it, I just
don't know.”
