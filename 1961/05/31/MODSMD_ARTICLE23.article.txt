# Foyt Triumphs in '500'
## 
### 
By United Press International
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — Na
tional champion A. J. Foyt, with
a healthy assist from Lady Luck,
rode the breaks and out-smarted
pole-sitter Eddie Sachs yesterday
to win the second closest 500-mile
auto race in history.
The 26-year-old Texan, never
out of contention but seemingly
out of first-place money with less
than 10 miles to go, grabbed the
lead on the 198th lap when Sachs
made a fourth and unexpected
23-second pit stop for fuel and
tires.

THAT WAS more than enough
to give the dapper Houston na
tive (he final load, and he crossed
the finish line 8.5 seconds ahead
of Sachs.

There were two spectacular
wrecks, including a five-car pile
up in view of thousands down the
main straight away after a car
spilled oil on the track, but none
of the drivers was injured seri
ously.

SACHS, the Center Valley, Pa.,
restaurant operator who became
only the third speedster to win
the pole spot two years in a row,
apparently had shaken off both
Foyt and Rodger Ward, the 1959
champ, with just 15 laps to go
when he wore down his right rear
tire and was forced into the pits.
Foyt, whose best previous fin-

ish in four attempts was 10th in
1959, played it "safe” the remain
ing three tours around the 212-
mile oval for his trip into victory
lane.

The triumph was expected to
net Foyt and his crew more than
the record $llO,OOO Jim Rath
mann split with his outfit for
winning last year’s thriller from
Ward in record speed.

IT WAS the closest finish since
Wilbur Shaw edged Ralph Hep
burn by 2.1 seconds in 1937.
Foyt’s speed for the distance
was 138.166 miles per hour, just
off the record of 138.767 M.P.H.
by Rathmann last year.

pole-sitter Eddie Sachs yesterday
to win the second closest 500-mile
auto race in history.
The 26-year-old Texan, never
out of contention but seemingly
out of first-place money with less
than 10 miles to go, grabbed the
lead on the 198th lap when Sachs
made a fourth and unexpected
23-second pit stop for fuel and
tires.

THAT WAS more than enough
to give the dapper Houston na
tive (he final load, and he crossed
the finish line 8.5 seconds ahead
of Sachs.

There were two spectacular
wrecks, including a five-car pile
up in view of thousands down the
main straight away after a car
spilled oil on the track, but none
of the drivers was injured seri
ously.

SACHS, the Center Valley, Pa.,
restaurant operator who became
only the third speedster to win
the pole spot two years in a row,
apparently had shaken off both
Foyt and Rodger Ward, the 1959
champ, with just 15 laps to go
when he wore down his right rear
tire and was forced into the pits.
Foyt, whose best previous fin-

ish in four attempts was 10th in
1959, played it "safe” the remain
ing three tours around the 212-
mile oval for his trip into victory
lane.

The triumph was expected to
net Foyt and his crew more than
the record $llO,OOO Jim Rath
mann split with his outfit for
winning last year’s thriller from
Ward in record speed.

IT WAS the closest finish since
Wilbur Shaw edged Ralph Hep
burn by 2.1 seconds in 1937.
Foyt’s speed for the distance
was 138.166 miles per hour, just
off the record of 138.767 M.P.H.
by Rathmann last year.
