# 'How Has Legislature Done?' Royse, Stewart Review Year
## 
### FRANCES FISHER 
Just what has Legislature ac
complished this year? What role
should Legislature serve? and
what improvements should be
made in the future?
1 These were questions posed to
ASSU President Larry Royse and
Student Financial Manager Todd
Stewart last night in an interview
with the Daily as a last look at
the school year before it closes
in two weeks.
Before presenting a list of
achievements of LASSU, Stewart
pointed out that Legislature’s
primary function is not as an
initiator of activities, but as a
sounding board and coordinating
force to which groups can come
with specific plans of action.
Stewart continued that Legisla
ture’s role is not to instill en
thusiasm, but to organize the en
thusiasm if it is already there.
Royse corroborated this, adding
that "it is nearly impossible for
a group as large as 30 to instill
enthusiasm.”
High on tlie list of accomplish
ments of the Legislature this year
was the abolition of the 2 '
\ charge for handling the money
of campus organizations, accord
i ing to Stewart.
j The money needed for the han
■ dling of student finances will now
come directly from the student
fees, which “should make the
charges more equitable,” Stewart
said.
Concerning investigations,
Royse mentioned that "investiga
tion should only be used if some
thing is obviously wrong which
the students can do something
about.” As far as exposing inade
quacies are concerned, Royse felt
that "the Daily can be much more
effective than Legislature,”
Commenting on the investiga
tions that have been carried on
this year, Stewart said that there
should have been a formal report
from Graduate Student Repre
sentative Ward McDonald's com
mittee which was to investigate
the health facilities. Royse said,
however, (hat the issue of the
new infirmary was not as impor
tant as the Daily’s reports seemed
to imply, but that “the Univer
sity was right in keeping the in
firmary low on the priority list.”
An investigation on lighting on
quad was made with subsequent
recommendations to the Univer
sity for adding lights. The inves-

} ligation on the work load pres
sure exerted on freshmen came
to nought, according to Stewart,
| because they found that nothing
specific could be recommended.
Creating by-laws for the classes
was another important achieve

merit cited by Stewart. The by
laws make t lie classes a definite
part of ASSU while before, with
out any kind of constitution, class
government had a very nebulous
position, stated Stewart.
Getting the library hours ex
tended was a third accomplish
ment, largely due to the efforts
of Legislature member Mary
Griffin, Stewart said.
Stewart used the creation of
Art Boar d as an example of
where Legislature helped to or
ganize existing enthusiasm. The
encouragement of fixing up the
boat-house was another activity
of Legislature.
Stewart pointed out the impor
tant position of Legislature in
appropriating the $53,000 of stu
dent body money. “Through ap
propriations, Legislature sets the
patterns of student activities,” he
said.

Both Stewart and Royse em
phasized Legislature’s role of cn
couraging and guiding its subsid
iary groups which include Politi
cal Union, HR. and Pre Reg Com
mittee, among many others.

In suggesting improvement for
the future, Royse said that he
hoped to see a student activities
board formed which would chan
nel enthusiasm where it is need
ed, by telling people, especially
freshmen, what activities arc
available to them and where help
is most needed.

Royse also said that he feels
that a change needs to be made
on Publication Board, to enforce
responsibility on the part of stu
dent publications. He said that
although resolutions for change
will be submitted at Legislature
tomorrow, he does not feel they
are reasonable or feasible.
