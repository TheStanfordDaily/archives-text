“A very able lad” with "an in
dependent mind” enrolled at Stan
ford for fall quarter 1940 under a
“permit to attend,” which gaix?
him permission to audit classes
of his own choice without credit.
Although his career here was
cut short when ho left for the
Navy, the young man evidently
enjoyed his stay, for he recom
mended Stanford to his sister.
While at Stanford, the student
stayed in a cottage at 624 May
field Ave.
MIS CURRENT address is 1600
Pennsylvania Ave., Washington,
D.C. the White House.
That's right. John Fitzgerald
Kennedy, president of the United
States, was once a Stanford stu
dent. And other members of the
Kennedy clan were connected
with the University during the
early forties a fact only a hand-
I ful of present Stanford students
I and faculty realize.
The president came here in
: 1940 under the special permit to
j audit courses in the Graduate
i School of Business. He also took
some political science courses.
ONTO OF them was from Prof.
Emeritus Graham H. Stuart. Stu
art does not remember Kennedy
as the course was one of the large
lecture type.
Another course the 23-year-old
[ youth took was on business and
I government from Theodore M.
Keeps in the Biz School, who re
calls “he was a very able lad"
with “a good . . . independent
mind.”
Kreps says Kennedy was enter
ed in his grade book and “I’m sure
I he would have come out with an
A if ho had finished it.” Kennedy
} loft around Christmas to enlist
i in the Navy.
KENNEDY also took a course
from Thomas S. Barclay, now a
professor of political science
emeritus.
Prof. Poland T. Chapin, now a
professor of speech and drama,
| notes “1 was very impressed with
| his alertness and his interest in
| England.” Kennedy’s book “Why
! England Slept” had just been pub
lished with a good reception.
“I used to see him on campus,
and ho was always friendly and
I cordial,” Chapin remembers.

Chapin was present when Ken
nedy registered for the draft (pic
ture at right), and notes that the
Palo Alto Times had him as Ken
nedy and JFK as him in the cap
tion under the picture they ran,
thus making Chapin a future
president.
KENNEDY'S sister, Eunice,
now Mrs. Robert S. Shriver Jr.,
was graduated from Stanford in
1914 with an A.B. in social sci
ence, although her final work for
her degree was done elsewhere.
In a letter written recently,
she remarks “I attended Stanford
at the suggestion of my brother,
President Kennedy, who had gone
there before mo and thought it a
very fine university.”
“My mother came out to Stan

ford for two or thi-ee months to
visit me, and during that time she
audited a few courses. She. too,
liked the university very much.”
Another Kennedy sister, Pa
tricia, now Mrs. Peter Lawford,
also attended Stanford in the sum
mer of 1943.
IX ANOTHER loiter, the presi
dent wrote an acquaintance, “I
want to assure you that I remem
ber . . . my experience at Stan-1
ford very pleasantly.”
The acquaintance, Mrs. Oran
V. Projean of Dallas, says “Every
one thought he was very glamor
ous.”
So, Harvard is not the only uni
versity with a claim to the cur- I
rent resident of IGUO Pennsyl
vania Ave.
