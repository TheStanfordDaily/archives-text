### 
CIUDAD TRUJILLO. Domini
can Republic (UPD— Dominican
strongman Generalissimo Rafael
Leonidas Trujillo was assassinat
ed Tuesday night on a seafront
avenue in his capital, the govern
ment announced yesterday.
Trujillo, 69, who had ruled since
1930 and was called the father of
his country, was shot and killed
on the Avenue George Washing
ton. The government communique
said nothing of the identity of the
killer or killers or their fate.
But an official government
broadcast said later that Trujillo
was killed by a group, not one
man.
It said details of the assassina
tion will not be released until an
ivestigation is completed, “since
the act was carried out not by one
person but a group of persons.”
Trujillo often strolled along the
avenue in the evening, accom
panied by a strong force of body
guards. The street runs along the
shore of the Caribbean from the
center of the capital.
IT WAS NOT known whether
Trujillo was killed while walking
or whether he was in a car. The
area was described as betwen two
fairgrounds. There are several
government and political party
buildings on the avenue.
The National Broadcasting
Company reported from Ciudad
Trujillo by telephone that retired
mas Diaz killed Trujillo and es-
Dominican Army Gen. Juan To
caped to the mountains, where he
has 1.000 loyal troops.
The NBC report said Diaz car
ried out the assassination for mo
tives of personal revenge and not
as an attempt to overthrow the
government. It said he was ac
companied by six men.
THE government communique,
issued over the signature of Presi
dent Joaquin Balaguer, eulogized
Trujillo and called for national
unity.
Meanwhile, i n Washington.
Sen. George A. Smathers, D-Fla.,
said two brigades of U.S. Marines
should be sent to the Dominican
Republic to prevent a Communist
takeover following the assassina
tion of Trujillo.
