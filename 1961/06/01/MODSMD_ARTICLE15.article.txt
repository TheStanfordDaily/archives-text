# Fiji Alumni Propose Plan To 'Receive’ Local Chapter
## Recommendations to Go to IFC, Then Winbigler for Approval 
### 
A plan for alumni receivership of the local Fiji chapter will be
presented to the Inter-Fraternity Council today for approval, accord
ing to a spokesman for the Fiji alumni.
According to alumni spokesmen, the receivership plan is de
signed to strengthen the chapter in its present difficulties. Under
the receivership, the alumni would participate in the operation of

the chapter and would assume
final responsibility.
Alumni action was prompted
last week when the University
issued the fraternity a one-week
ultimatum to organize a plan un
der which its alumni would take
control of the chapter. The alter
native was to have the chapter
dissolved.
UNIVERSITY action was taken
against the fraternity because of
a pledge prank two weeks ago in
which active Don Peterson was
kidnapped, smeared with molas
ses and feathers, and then dump
ed in a park near Gilroy.

Dr. James T. Watkins, member
of the IFC board, expressed the
view that the alumni plan, which
is similar to the one under which
Sigma Nu operated during part
of last year, will be approved.
“Since it fulfills the request of
the IFC. board, there is no reason
to believe that it will not be ac
cepted.” ho said.
ALREADY in efforts to salvage
the chapter, Dean Charles F.
Park of the School of Mineral Sci
ences has been appointed as new
faculty adviser to the Fijis.
Since the University ultimatum
was given a week ago, the Fiji
alumni have met and formed a
committee which then drew up
the receivership plan. Two alum
n i representatives Edwin
Wright, class of ’5l, and Louis Pi
cetti, class of ’so—will appear
before the IFC board today to
present the proposal.

THK ALUMNI committee in
cludes among others Dean David
S. Larimer, a Fiji of the class of
’5O who once served as IFC presi
dent, and C. Langdon White.

Once the IFC board has acted
on the alumni plan, their recom
mendation will go to Dean of Stu
dents H. Donald Winbigler for
final approval. A decision should
be forthcoming from his office
within a few days.
The embattled Fijis, who lost
their house in a fire last year and
are now under fire for the recent
pledge prank, will live in the
Stanford Village next year until
they can move into one of the
houses on the row that will be va
cated when the first fraternity
cluster opens.
