# Chappie Group To Ask ASSU Rules Change
## 
### 
Hammer and Coffin Society
will present their proposal for an
ASSU By-Laws change at LASSU
tonight. They hope that this ac
tion will result in the reinstate
ment of the Chaparrel, suspended
from campus by Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler May 12.
Both Winbigler and ASSU Pres
ident Larry Royse have said that
the proposed change is “unsatis
factory.”
ACCORDING TO Jim McGee,
next year’s administrative assist
ant to the ASSU President, the
amendment provides for editorial
control by the officers and other
salaried members of Hammer and
Coffin.

They would review the Chappie
before publication, and have the
power to reject any material
which a two-thirds majority found
unsatisfactory. McGee said.
The main objection to the pro
posal is that it limits review of
the Chappie to internal control.

OUTSIDE CONTROL, in the
form of a stronger Publications
Board, is also being considered.
Pub Board yesterday elected Jer
ry Dobson, Daily business man
ager, as a “chairman, pro tern.”

One of his ciuitics will be to con
sider proposals for changes in the
board over the summer, and to
have these proposals in concrete
form to be worked on by the
board in the fall.
Meanwhile, Chuck Landis, busi
ness manager for the Chappie,
said that the Chappie is busy
handling the paper work connect
ed with the last issue, which had
to bo cancelled after subscription.
Their status for next, year is in
definite and will probably not be
decided before the close of this
quarter.
