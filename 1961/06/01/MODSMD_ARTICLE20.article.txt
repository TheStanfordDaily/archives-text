If any student editor were to try to listen to and read, much less
answer, all the attacks on his policies and person during his volume,
he might as well shut down the presses before he has started. Dur
ing this quarter I, like my predecessors, have received my share of
criticism about the Daily's national politics and local stands. I pre
fer to think, like Abraham Lincoln, that "I have endured a great
deal of ridicule without much malice; and have received a great
deal of kindness, not quite free from ridicule.”
Our policy this quarter on both the news and editorial pages has
been to cover and comment on local news first and off-campus news
second. This policy has caused both favorable and adverse com
ments.
There are many who demand more off-campus news coverage
and we must agree with them that Daily coverage of national and
international events is incomplete, simply because the Daily does
not have the space to print the reams of material which comes ticking
off the wire. If the students were to give more of their tuition dollar,
the Daily would add more pages, and more complete coverage
would be established. But the Daily is the only source of local news;
it must cover this news first, for there is no alternative for the reader
■ —there are many alternatives for those students who wish off-cam
pus news.
When writing editorially on off-campus matters I have taken
a conservative viewpoint, the first such viewpoint on the Daily in
my brief term at Stanford. This viewpoint has consistently irritated
some of the more persistent and outspoken liberals among students
and faculty. Hopefully, in the process of criticism, I enabled them
to sharpen their doctrines.
While our coverage of local news produced results, it also pro
duced problems. The Administration moved on the Health Center
issue, as it did in the previous volume on housing discrimination,
to solve a problem which was brought to their attention. Student
organizations, on the other hand, have not developed enough politi
cal sophistication to solve exposed problems. The Interfratemity
Council this week was far more occupied in wondering how the
Daily found out about the Interfratemity Board meeting, than estab
lishing any sort of fraternity policy. Perhaps as student leaders lose
this hyper-sensitivity to public criticism they too will begin to pro
pose vigorous programs of action for stagnant organizations such as
the IFC and the Legislature. Certaintly I wish Bob Sayler and his
braintrust the best of luck in their bold plans.
As I move out of the editor's chair for Jerry Rankin, a hard-hitting
writer and a fine editor, I do so with the knowledge that we on the
staff have covered and commented on the news with freedom from
all obligation except that of fidelity to the public interest. In the proc
ess we have lost a few friends, but we have gained many more.

deal of kindness, not quite free from ridicule.”
Our policy this quarter on both the news and editorial pages has
been to cover and comment on local news first and off-campus news
second. This policy has caused both favorable and adverse com
ments.
There are many who demand more off-campus news coverage
and we must agree with them that Daily coverage of national and
international events is incomplete, simply because the Daily does
not have the space to print the reams of material which comes ticking
off the wire. If the students were to give more of their tuition dollar,
the Daily would add more pages, and more complete coverage
would be established. But the Daily is the only source of local news;
it must cover this news first, for there is no alternative for the reader
■ —there are many alternatives for those students who wish off-cam
pus news.
When writing editorially on off-campus matters I have taken
a conservative viewpoint, the first such viewpoint on the Daily in
my brief term at Stanford. This viewpoint has consistently irritated
some of the more persistent and outspoken liberals among students
and faculty. Hopefully, in the process of criticism, I enabled them
to sharpen their doctrines.
While our coverage of local news produced results, it also pro
duced problems. The Administration moved on the Health Center
issue, as it did in the previous volume on housing discrimination,
to solve a problem which was brought to their attention. Student
organizations, on the other hand, have not developed enough politi
cal sophistication to solve exposed problems. The Interfratemity
Council this week was far more occupied in wondering how the
Daily found out about the Interfratemity Board meeting, than estab
lishing any sort of fraternity policy. Perhaps as student leaders lose
this hyper-sensitivity to public criticism they too will begin to pro
pose vigorous programs of action for stagnant organizations such as
the IFC and the Legislature. Certaintly I wish Bob Sayler and his
braintrust the best of luck in their bold plans.
As I move out of the editor's chair for Jerry Rankin, a hard-hitting
writer and a fine editor, I do so with the knowledge that we on the
staff have covered and commented on the news with freedom from
all obligation except that of fidelity to the public interest. In the proc
ess we have lost a few friends, but we have gained many more.

If any student editor were to try to listen to and read, much less
answer, all the attacks on his policies and person during his volume,
he might as well shut down the presses before he has started. Dur
ing this quarter I, like my predecessors, have received my share of
criticism about the Daily's national politics and local stands. I pre
fer to think, like Abraham Lincoln, that "I have endured a great
deal of ridicule without much malice; and have received a great
deal of kindness, not quite free from ridicule.”
