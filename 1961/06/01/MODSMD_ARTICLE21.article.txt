# All-Stanford Sequoia on Sale; Roscoe, Pauofsky Contribute
## 
### JOEL MEISTER 
The Spring Sequoia goes on
sale Tuesday, and for the first
time in many isues, this is an
all-Stanford issue. This reviewer
suspects that Editor Judy Rascoe
may have placed too much faith
in her fellow students.
Miss Rascoe herself has con
tributed, in the Note entitled “The
Shortest Way with Dissenters,” a
delectable little nothing which
says, in effect, that riots (remem
ber Black Friday?) and rioters
are silly. Demonstrations seem
also to be included.
IF HER implied stand is a cor
rect or an acceptable one, then
the Note is indeed delightful. But
she is in the unfortunate position
of being a liberal impugning the
good sense of other liberals, and
for this who can forgive her?
It is to Sequoia’s credit that it
has published Dr. Wolfgang Pa
nofsky’s article on disarmament.
Panofsky provides informed ex
pert opinion on this intricate
problem, a problem which may
prove to be insoluble except
through war or continued stale
mate. He discusses, notably, the
prospects for success of the cur
rent test-ban negotiations at Ge
neva.
JUDITH HOUTZ treats Ayn
Rand’s “For the New Intellectu
al” as it deserves—swiftly and
with a dagger blunted only by the
lack of space necessary to expose
fully the insult to humanity
which Miss Rand is perpetrating.
Fortunately for us, Miss Rand is
a Utopian whether she knows it
or not.
All the poetry is quite minor,
the best being “To My Father”
by R. A. Christmas. It is an ab
straction of the wisdom that
comes with age. It fails ulti
mately in its confused conception
of the change from a search for
absolutes to a faith in “calm mor
ality,” for does not “calm moral
ity” itself imply an absolute? The
rhythm is generally treated well,
with a few inverted feet and a
polished variation on natural syl
labic emphasis.
“POPPA” by William Walker
is a vignette about a grand old

man, but it suffers from a seem
ingly contrived climax, stereotyp
ing and sentimentality that de
tract too much from occasional
poignancy and good detail.
Sharon Cobb’s “Picnic” con
trols feeling better but is pretty
strong stuff for an 11-year old,
the age of the narrator. The con
trasts between her family, her
divorced father and her new
father are convincingly drawn.
“Childe Harold in the Wilder
ness” takes the award for frus
trated realism. L. J. Davis has,
perhaps, contributed one of the
better recent pieces of undergrad
uate autobiography. It has a sus
picious brevity but a satisfying
unity. Not 100 much is attempted,
and what is said is said pungently
and articulately.
IN SPITE of its weaknesses,
Sequoia is, as always, worthwhile
reading. The magazine is our own,
and its work, judged by parochial
standards, is good. Neither time
nor money will be misspent in
purchasing a copy next week.
The issue will be on sale for 50
cents at Engineering Corner, the
post office and the Cellar.

The Spring Sequoia goes on
sale Tuesday, and for the first
time in many isues, this is an
all-Stanford issue. This reviewer
suspects that Editor Judy Rascoe
may have placed too much faith
in her fellow students.
Miss Rascoe herself has con
tributed, in the Note entitled “The
Shortest Way with Dissenters,” a
delectable little nothing which
says, in effect, that riots (remem
ber Black Friday?) and rioters
are silly. Demonstrations seem
also to be included.
IF HER implied stand is a cor
rect or an acceptable one, then
the Note is indeed delightful. But
she is in the unfortunate position
of being a liberal impugning the
good sense of other liberals, and
for this who can forgive her?
It is to Sequoia’s credit that it
has published Dr. Wolfgang Pa
nofsky’s article on disarmament.
Panofsky provides informed ex
pert opinion on this intricate
problem, a problem which may
prove to be insoluble except
through war or continued stale
mate. He discusses, notably, the
prospects for success of the cur
rent test-ban negotiations at Ge
neva.
JUDITH HOUTZ treats Ayn
Rand’s “For the New Intellectu
al” as it deserves—swiftly and
with a dagger blunted only by the
lack of space necessary to expose
fully the insult to humanity
which Miss Rand is perpetrating.
Fortunately for us, Miss Rand is
a Utopian whether she knows it
or not.
All the poetry is quite minor,
the best being “To My Father”
by R. A. Christmas. It is an ab
straction of the wisdom that
comes with age. It fails ulti
mately in its confused conception
of the change from a search for
absolutes to a faith in “calm mor
ality,” for does not “calm moral
ity” itself imply an absolute? The
rhythm is generally treated well,
with a few inverted feet and a
polished variation on natural syl
labic emphasis.
“POPPA” by William Walker
is a vignette about a grand old

man, but it suffers from a seem
ingly contrived climax, stereotyp
ing and sentimentality that de
tract too much from occasional
poignancy and good detail.
Sharon Cobb’s “Picnic” con
trols feeling better but is pretty
strong stuff for an 11-year old,
the age of the narrator. The con
trasts between her family, her
divorced father and her new
father are convincingly drawn.
“Childe Harold in the Wilder
ness” takes the award for frus
trated realism. L. J. Davis has,
perhaps, contributed one of the
better recent pieces of undergrad
uate autobiography. It has a sus
picious brevity but a satisfying
unity. Not 100 much is attempted,
and what is said is said pungently
and articulately.
IN SPITE of its weaknesses,
Sequoia is, as always, worthwhile
reading. The magazine is our own,
and its work, judged by parochial
standards, is good. Neither time
nor money will be misspent in
purchasing a copy next week.
