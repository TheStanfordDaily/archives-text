Bulbs in Church
I wish to protest the presence
and activity of the military pho
tographers in the Memorial Day
service in Memorial Church.
Though I appreciate the purpose
and necessity of adequate publi
city, I fail to understand why suf
ficient pictures could not have
been taken outside the church.
Having persons taking pictures
inside the church, especially with
a flash, is not only counter to Uni
versity tradition and generally ac
cepted standards of good taste,
but was an Irritating distraction
from an otherwise beautiful and
meaningful service. To avoid such
distraction in the future would be
to return to the service its proper
serious tone, and to increase its
meaning for all present.
