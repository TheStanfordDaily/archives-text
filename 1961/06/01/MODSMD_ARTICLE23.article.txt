On Peer Gynt
The Stanford Players’ produc
tion of Peer Gynt last week re
vealed to several thousand play
goers one of the most stunning
triumphs of local direction, stag
ing, music, and acting in recent
years. It may surely be consider
ed a major intellectual event for
any campus dedicated to active
learning. Yet we have searched
the Stanford Daily in vain for a
review or discussion of this ex
traordinary production. Advanced
publicity was commendable but
not, we feel, a sufficient discharge
of the abligation of a university
paper. It surely is not too much
to expect the Daily to provide a
review of Peer Gynt. We recall
with pleasure the columns by
Mary Lou McKinley for the edi
torial board which preceded
yours, and we are unwilling to
believe that other reviewers of
equal talent cannot be found to
carry on the important function
of critic and commentator.
We have neither the time nor
the experience to furnish your
readers with the sort of review
they should come to expect from
the Peninsula’s “only morning
newspaper.” But we are deter
mined that the outstanding fea
tures of this production be duly
recorded and those responsible
he given recognition for what
they did, Robert Loper demon
strated once again that he is one
of the outstanding directors of
university theater in the nation.
His extraordinary management
of a difficult play revealed prac
ticed skill in drawing together a
sprawling, diffuse drama and in
enhancing its meaning; simul
taneously he showed an unerring
sensitivity to comic nuance and
intellectual mood. Much of the
performance belonged to Philip
Angeloff, for the title role re
quires a professional virtuosity
which he made to seem effortless.
But the depth of talent in the rest
of the casting was no less impres
sive: Hugh Evans, John Harrop,
Ross Durfee, James Kerans, El
len Stenzel, and Yynn Boatsman,
to name only a few, made the
most of their smaller parts; and
enhancing all the roles was again
the imagination and intelligence
of the director. Equally striking
in the Frost Amphitheater were
the costumes by Irene Griffin and
Larry Wismer, the effectiveness
of Paul Landry’s lighting, the
focused simplicity of Richard
Hay’s sets, and the breathtaking
appropriateness of Leonard Rat
ner’s music, especially in the
opening measures which fore
shadowed the troubled torment of
the nightmares of modern man
while from the shadows there
catapaulted into the light the com
edy of the dream-haunted boy and
his mother. From this blend of
color, costume, movement, and
music—the sculptured comedy of
the troll king, the surrealistic
madness of the lunatic asylum,
the nursery realism of the ride
a-cock horses and pigs, and the
frenetic demons of Peer Gynt’s
inner world there emerged a
unified image of the aging child
that is in all of us and the oddly
shaped morality of the shocking
outer world that is both our own
discovery and our own making.
It is tempting and easy for a
college community to take talent
in its theater for granted. It is

far wiser to remind ourselves that
such talent is rare in any com
muniiy and that at Stanford it
plays a priceless and integral part
in the intellectual life of the uni
versity.

Responsibility for public meet
ings on campus rests with the
Committee on Public Exercises,
of which I am chairman. The com
mittee sponsors a large number of
public events itself and also is re
sponsible for scheduling and ap
proval of other public meetings,
including those sponsored by stu
dent organizations.
With one exception, in (he three
years I have been chairman of
the Public Exercises Committee
we have approved every formal
application tor a public meeting
sponsored by a student group.
The reason for the single excep
tion was repeated failure to com
ply with our regulations. It did
not involve ahighly controversial
topic.
This does not mean "anything
goes.” Obviously, certain stan
dards of taste and sanity must
be reuired of speakers who seek
a University platform. The found
ing grant forbids the use of the
University’s name in partisan
politics. Student organizations
concerned with public issues have
an obligation to present a bal
anced program. Individual meet
ings may be partisan or one sided,
but the program for the year must
present opposing points of view
on highly controversial issues.
I am satisfied that the HR and
the Political Union have complied
with the policies of the University
and indeed are to be congratulat
ed for their contributions to Stan
ford’s intellectual life this year.
The implications of the inter
views in the Stanford Daily on
Monday,. May 22 are incorrect.

(Students interested in scheduling
j a speech by Robert Welch were
j unable to obtain him. Fulton Lew
i is 111 is not an appropriate speak
|er for the Committee on Public
Exercises program but may speak
under student sponsorship.
The purpose of the public
events is to improve the intellec
tual and cultural life of the cam
pus. Public relations and fund
raising are not the direct concern
I of the committee.

A serious problem has arisen
because of the theft of copies of
the “Hispanic American Report”
from the Stanford Library. The
“Hispanic American Report” goes
out of print almost immediately,
and it is difficult to replace miss
ing copies. Earlier this quarter
when the theft of some issues was
reported, the Library took the
“Report” off the open shelves and
placed it behind the librarian's
desk. This has apparently not de
ferred students, and now no less
j than eight 1960 numbers (out of
j twelve) are missing. To make
■ matters worse, one bound volume
i has been removed from the Social
Science Reading Room. It will be
almost impossible to replace the
missing items, and it is inexcus
able that Stanford Library should
not have a complete set of one of
the University’s own publications.
When students enter Stanford,
they agree to abide by the Honor
Code, and the theft of materials
from the Stanford Library is ex
plicitly a breach of the Fundamen
j tal Standard. Moreover, common
: sense and decency should tell the
| student that the theft of library
j materials does a grave injustice
; to a multitude of other students.

May I appeal to the students
who have removed these materi
als from the Library to return
them immediately?
