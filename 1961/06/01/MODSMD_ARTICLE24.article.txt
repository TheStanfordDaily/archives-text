# No Clear-Cut ‘Athlete-of-Year
## 
### RON RAPOPORT 
The way things went in Stan
ford sports this year, YOU might
well be Stanford Athlete of the
Year for 1960-1961.

Not to say that there weren’t
outstanding individual performers
on the Farm’s spoils scene this
year -there were but to single
out the one really top athlete is,
as the King of Siam would have
said, “a puzzlement.”
TWO YEARS AOO, the Daily
sports staff faced an agonizing de
cision. Dick Norman was the top
passer in collegiate football. And
Paul Neumann had established
himself as one of the top basket
ball players ever to play at Stan
ford. Neumann won the award.
Last year was more of the
same. Chris Bttrford tied the na
tional collegiate record for passes
caught in a single season and as
co-captain of the Indian gridders
he performed magnificently in
each and every game. But Ernie
Cunliffe had etched his name on
the University record books as
the best middle-distance runner
the Farm has ever known.
Ernie came within four-tenths
of a second of a four-minute mile
and turned in sensational times
in both the mile and the 880 in
meet after meet. Cunliffe got the
Daily’s nod and that made it two
of Stanford’s all-time football
greats who had been done in by
the Peninsula’s Only.
BUT WHERE are the Neu
manns and the Cunliffes this
year? And where, for that matter,
are the Normans of old and the
Burfords? Face it; there just
aren’t any. And in the sports
staff’s humble opinion, there isn’t
anyone even close.
It was a bad year for sports and
as unkind as it may be to say it
now, 1961 was probably one of the
worst sports years in Stanford’s
history.
Outstanding performers? There
were some. And there were some
who showed great promise.
HAVE WEILL, a discus throw
er of mammoth proportions, set
a new Stanford discus record this
year, although he is only a sopho
more. Weill’s mark of 179-8 rushes
him to the front ranks of the na
tion’s platter pushers. His poten
tial is considered to be unlimited
and a world record is definitely a
possibility. Weill is a top con
tender for Athlete of the Year.
Another year.

Outstanding performers on an
outstandingly poor football team
were Norman and Skip Face. That
both the accurate-tossing Norman
and hard-running fullback Face
will he plaqed among the best of
the Indians’ football players is

certain.
John Windsor, high - scoring
mainstay of the basketball team,
was the standout for the cagers.
The 6-8 forward has another year
left to lead Howie Dallmar’s
charges and advance notices for
the Indian five look good.
IN BASEBALL John Hurlbut,
hardhitting left fielder, was the
leader and received the team’s
most valuable player award.
Bernie Knaggs was named hon
orable mention on the All-Ameri
can soccer team and Emanuel
Andah and Dan Farthing were on
the all-league team.
Kyrk Reid and Stan Lindskog
were important cogs in what was
probably Stanford’s most success
ful team this year, Pete Kmeto
vic’s rugby squad.
IN' TENNIS Dick Ogden and
George Bates were the leaders and
Steve Smith, Kent Winton and
Bill Parish paced the golf team to
11 consecutive dual meet victories.
John Jurgensen and Tom Red
fern were stars for the swim
team, Jon Loreen and Dick Lyon
starred for the Stanford crew.
Dick Denney led the wrestlers.
