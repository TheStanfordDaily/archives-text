Joo Amalfitano logged out an
infield single with the bases load
ed in the ninth inning to give San
Francisco a 3-2 victory over the
St. Louis Cardinals yesterday in
the major leagues’ only flay game.
Amalfitano came up after relief
pitcher Mickey McDermott had in
tentionally walked Felipe Alou
with two out to fill the hags. He
hit a slow roller back to third
baseman Ken Boyer and barely
beat the throw at first bise as Jim
Davenport came across with the
clinching run.
The victory assured the Giants
at least a tie for first place in
National League standings. The
Cards now have lost 13 out of 15
one-run decisions this year.
Julian Javier tripled in Hal
Smith to give the Cardinals a 1-0
lead in the fifth inning and they
scored another run in the sixth on
a sacrifice fly by Joe Cunning
ham.
The Giants tied it in their half
of the sixth on a pair of unearned
runs set up by shortstop Bob Lil
lis’ throwing error.
The win ended a three-game
losing streak for the Giants and
marked the continuation of the
team’s fine performance in away
games.
