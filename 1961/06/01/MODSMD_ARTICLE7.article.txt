## 
### 
If you are a freshman or soph
omore you will still be around
Stanford when the new Tresidder
Memorial Union opens.
Chester Berry, Director of the
Stanford Union, announced yes
terday that bids have been re

ceived and that construction may
begin by the end of this month.
Completion of the student union
is scheduled for September of
1962.
According to the planning of
fice, the bids that have been re
ceived are close to the University
estimates, causing no delays in
the construction schedule. The
contract will be awarded after a
Board of Trustees meeting on
June 15.

Costing $2,675,000, the new
union will include restaurant
areas, lounges, meeting and con
ference rooms, music listening
rooms, a circulating art library,
and recreational areas with bowl
ing, billiards, and table tennis.
In a concise statement put out
by the Stanford Board of Trus
tees, the union was described as
“the community center of Stan
ford University, serving its stu
dents, faculty, administration,
alumni and guests.’’
The trustees emphasized that
Tresidder will not be a student
union with facilities available only
to students. “Closely integrated
into the Union concept is the goal
of increased contact between stu
dents and faculty,” the trustee re
port said.

The new union will be located
adjacent to the Women’s Club
house' facing Dinkelspiol Auditor
ium. Santa Teresa Avenue will
be blocked off near the Corpora
tion Yard and the Stanford fire
house and the area from there to
the Post Office converted into a
landscaped mall.
