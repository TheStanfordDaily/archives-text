It's about those bikes . . .
Stanford Police Chief Gor
don Davis reports that once
again the area behind the po
lice department is filled with
bicycles the Stanford police
have picked up around cam
pus.
Davis estimates there arc
about 33 bikes in the group,
and urges anyone who has
lost a bike to stop by and
check to see if his is among
them.
He notes the police do not
have space to store (ho bikes
and canâ€™t keep them around
indefinitely. Ho hopes many
of the vehicles can be return
ed to their owners before the
homeward migration for the
summer vacation.
Davis also asks that those
planning to leave their bikes
here during the summer find
an appropriate storage place,
as the police will not keep the
bikes they find lying about
during the summer.
