# DREAM BECOMES REALITY
## Work Starts on Stanford Union 
### 
Work on Stanford's long-awaited student union—dream of Farm
students for more than a decade—began Monday.
Contractor Howard J. White of Palo Alto was awarded the con
tract for his low bid of $1,834,000.
The union will be named after Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, who

served as Stanford’s fourth presi
dent from 1943 to his death in
1948. He earned his A.B. degree
in 1919 and his M.D. in 1927 from
Stanford.
COST OF the entire project,
which includes landscaping, fur
nishings, and equipment, is $2,-
675,000.
Tresidder’s widow, Mrs. Mary
Curry Tresidder, will be a special
guest when the University’s offi
cial site dedication ceremony is
held July 20.
In laying out the policy for the
new structure, the University
trustees said;
“THE UNION shall bo the com
munity center of Stanford Uni
versity, serving its students, fac
ulty, staff, alumni and guests,
“It shall provide . . . services,
conveniences and amenities , . .
(and) ... be a part of the in
formal educational program . . •
Its committees, board, and staffs
shall present a social, cultural,
recreational and pro
gram for the whole campus.”
Chester Berry, Union director,
said “A student can drop in to
bowl a game or two, then be
drawn to a lecture, a discussion
group or a musical program. We
want to make the lines between
academic and non-academic zones
disappear.”
FUNDS FOR the building came
from Mrs. Tresidder, individual
members of the Board of Trustees
and other donors, student and
Union funds and a final sum con
tributed through Stanford’s $lOO
million three-year PACE drive.
Plans were drawn by architects
Spencer and Lee of San Francisco.
Student ideas, stemming from a
series of committees fprmed since
1948, have been extensively
worked in.
The two-story building will be
located roughly on a north-south
axis, facing Dinkelspiel Audi
torium qcross a landscaped plaza.
It will be a major part of the
student activities complex which
includes the year-old post office,
bookstore and a soon-to-be-re
modeled old Union building.
SANTA TESESA Street, run
ning from Lagunita Court to the
post office, is blocked by the new
building and traffic is being rout
ed via Duenna Street past the po
lice department and out via Pana
ma Street.
Lasuen Street, which runs down
the Row and past the post office,
also is closed off at Campus Drive.
Thus, the closed parking spots
available for those wishing to visit
the post office or bookstore are in
the parking lot behind the book
store.
On the lower level of the build
ing will be a 14-lane bowling in
stallation, billiards, table tennis,
service center, barber shop, travel
agency, store and large dining
area.
On the second level will be the
Associated Students office, eight

other student offices, music and
reading areas, games room, Union
offices, an information desk, box
office, lobby and display gallery
areas, a circulating art library
and many conference rooms and
lounges with expandable walls.

shall present a social, cultural,
recreational and pro
gram for the whole campus.”
Chester Berry, Union director,
said “A student can drop in to
bowl a game or two, then be
drawn to a lecture, a discussion
group or a musical program. We
want to make the lines between
academic and non-academic zones
disappear.”
FUNDS FOR the building came
from Mrs. Tresidder, individual
members of the Board of Trustees
and other donors, student and
Union funds and a final sum con
tributed through Stanford’s $lOO
million three-year PACE drive.
Plans were drawn by architects
Spencer and Lee of San Francisco.
Student ideas, stemming from a
series of committees fprmed since
1948, have been extensively
worked in.
The two-story building will be
located roughly on a north-south
axis, facing Dinkelspiel Audi
torium qcross a landscaped plaza.
It will be a major part of the
student activities complex which
includes the year-old post office,
bookstore and a soon-to-be-re
modeled old Union building.
SANTA TESESA Street, run
ning from Lagunita Court to the
post office, is blocked by the new
building and traffic is being rout
ed via Duenna Street past the po
lice department and out via Pana
ma Street.
Lasuen Street, which runs down
the Row and past the post office,
also is closed off at Campus Drive.
Thus, the closed parking spots
available for those wishing to visit
the post office or bookstore are in
the parking lot behind the book
store.
On the lower level of the build
ing will be a 14-lane bowling in
stallation, billiards, table tennis,
service center, barber shop, travel
agency, store and large dining
area.
On the second level will be the
Associated Students office, eight

other student offices, music and
reading areas, games room, Union
offices, an information desk, box
office, lobby and display gallery
areas, a circulating art library
and many conference rooms and
lounges with expandable walls.
Work on Stanford's long-awaited student union—dream of Farm
students for more than a decade—began Monday.
Contractor Howard J. White of Palo Alto was awarded the con
tract for his low bid of $1,834,000.
The union will be named after Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, who

served as Stanford’s fourth presi
dent from 1943 to his death in
1948. He earned his A.B. degree
in 1919 and his M.D. in 1927 from
Stanford.
COST OF the entire project,
which includes landscaping, fur
nishings, and equipment, is $2,-
675,000.
Tresidder’s widow, Mrs. Mary
Curry Tresidder, will be a special
guest when the University’s offi
cial site dedication ceremony is
held July 20.
In laying out the policy for the
new structure, the University
trustees said;
“THE UNION shall bo the com
munity center of Stanford Uni
versity, serving its students, fac
ulty, staff, alumni and guests,
“It shall provide . . . services,
conveniences and amenities , . .
(and) ... be a part of the in
formal educational program . . •
Its committees, board, and staffs
shall present a social, cultural,
