# International Relations Group Hoping for Active Summer
## 
### 
Stanford’s student-run Institute
of International Relations hopes
to operate a program during the
summer quarter, the first time
this has ever been attempted.
Bill Hawthorne, acting HR
president for the summer, said
the group would like to continue
operations this summer, but needs
about $3OO to do so. He plans to
appeal to various officials for the
funds.

The HR was formed in 1948 by
returning war veterans to help
build international understanding
and to acquaint Stanford students
with foreign lands, peoples and
problems.
DURING THE regular school
year, the group holds programs,
conferences, talks and many other
activities concerning international
relations.

Once each year it brings a noted
speaker, such as Ralph Bunche or
Averell Harriman, to campus for
a few days of talks and informal
discussion with students.
Hawthorne notes "The sum
mer student provides the HR with
a unique opportunity to reach
students that it might normally
not in its usual school year.
“WITH experience in working
for the HR (summer students
here from other universities)
might be . . . inspired to re-evalu
ate their own international pro
gram at their home university.
“The secondary and college
level teachers attending the sum
mer quarter” might "also spread
their experience into their own
schools.”
He adds that the HR also has
many projects and carry-over op
erations from the regular school
year which must be worked on
during the summer.
PLANS FOB next year’s exten
sive program must be continued

also, and Hawthorne points out
that all of these activities need
people to work on them.
For Stanford students here dur
ing the summer, activity credit is
available.
Some of the projects Haw
thorne and the other HR work
ers hope to accomplish this sum
mer:
• Establishment of a Stanford
Overseas Information Service li
brary. (The SOIS is part of the
HR.)
• Painting and re-decorating
the HR shack, which is in run
down shape.
• HAVE coffee hours with for
eign students.
• Perhaps have some confer
ences for summer students on in
ternational topics.
• Complete the mammoth HR
book drive, which already has
gathered thousands of books to be
shipped overseas.

• Continue the work of the
Africa and Latin America desks.
Hawthorne invites any summer
student interested in doing any
kind of work for the HR to drop
by the HR shack tomorrow at
5 p.m.

Any student interested in work
ing for the Institute of Interna
tional Relations in any capacity
this summer should attend a gen
eral meeting scheduled for to
morrow at 5 p.m. at the HR
shack. The shack is located across
the street from Geology Corner,
near the Women’s Gym.
