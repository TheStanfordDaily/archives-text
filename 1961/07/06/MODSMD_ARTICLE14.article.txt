# Stanford Gets Big Defense Contract!
## $2.6 Million Award to Help With Materials Research Lag 
### 
The Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency
has awarded Stanford a $2.6 million four-year contract to help over
come a lag in basic research materials.
The University was one of five to receive awards totalling $13.4
million. The others were MIT, Harvard, Brown, and Chicago.

- Need for the program is empha
sized by the exacting demands of
advanced missile and other so
phisticated weapons systems, the
Defense Department announced.
STANFORD expects to appoint
some 17 new faculty members and
8 research associates over the
four-year period and obtain ex
tensive specialized equipment to
increase research in solid state
physics, chemistry, electronics,
metallurgy and ceramics.
About 60 graduate students are
to participate.
A Center for Materials Re
search will be established in part
of a proposed $2.5 million build
ing, a large portion of which is
to be financed through Stanford’s
current PACE campaign to raise
$lOO million.
INVESTIGATIONS will be car
ried on in the laboratories of sev
eral departments and the whole
program will be administrated by
an inter-departmental executive
committee Robert A. Huggins of
the Stanford faculty has been ap
pointed chairman and director of
the center.
This ARPA program arose
from the Defense Department’s
realization that fundamental re
search in the behavior of ma
terials was not keeping pace with
the tremendous advances in ap
plications research, much of it
conducted in government and in
dustrial laboratories.
It has been found that inade
quate materials are actually the
limiting factor in the performance
of many of the advanced systems
and devices the Defense Depart
ment wishes to develop, according
to the ARPA announcement.
IN ADDITION to research fa
cilities, the new center at Stanford
will have central service labora
tories for growing crystals and
preparing experimental materials
as well as analytical facilities for
precise determination of chemical
composition and structural fea
tures.
The center will occupy about
35,000 square feet, or a little less
than half, of the building to be
constructed in the University’s
growing Science Quad. It is ex
pected to provide also for a solid
state electronics laboratory and
added facilities for the School of
Engineering, included a library.
Facing on Lomita Drive, it will
match Russell H. Varian Labora
tory of Physics which is now un
der construction. The Physics
Lecture Hall will be axial between
to two.

ARPA MONEY does not qualify
for matching by the Ford Founda
tion, which has agreed to give
Stanford $1 for each $3 it raises,
up to a total of $25 million. Fed
eral funds and other Ford grants
are expected.
Basic research in materials at
Stanford, largely with the depart
ments of Physics, Chemistry, Ma
terials Science and Electrical En
gineering, currently is running at
about $1 million a year.
It includes investigations of
super-conductivity, the behavior
of materials at temperatures near
absolute zero, and high frequency
resonance studies into the nature
of magnetism.

the center.
This ARPA program arose
from the Defense Department’s
realization that fundamental re
search in the behavior of ma
terials was not keeping pace with
the tremendous advances in ap
plications research, much of it
conducted in government and in
dustrial laboratories.
It has been found that inade
quate materials are actually the
limiting factor in the performance
of many of the advanced systems
and devices the Defense Depart
ment wishes to develop, according
to the ARPA announcement.
IN ADDITION to research fa
cilities, the new center at Stanford
will have central service labora
tories for growing crystals and
preparing experimental materials
as well as analytical facilities for
precise determination of chemical
composition and structural fea
tures.
The center will occupy about
35,000 square feet, or a little less
than half, of the building to be
constructed in the University’s
growing Science Quad. It is ex
pected to provide also for a solid
state electronics laboratory and
added facilities for the School of
Engineering, included a library.
Facing on Lomita Drive, it will
match Russell H. Varian Labora
tory of Physics which is now un
der construction. The Physics
Lecture Hall will be axial between
to two.

ARPA MONEY does not qualify
for matching by the Ford Founda
tion, which has agreed to give
Stanford $1 for each $3 it raises,
up to a total of $25 million. Fed
eral funds and other Ford grants
are expected.
Basic research in materials at
Stanford, largely with the depart
ments of Physics, Chemistry, Ma
terials Science and Electrical En
gineering, currently is running at
about $1 million a year.
It includes investigations of
super-conductivity, the behavior
of materials at temperatures near
absolute zero, and high frequency
resonance studies into the nature
of magnetism.
The Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency
has awarded Stanford a $2.6 million four-year contract to help over
come a lag in basic research materials.
The University was one of five to receive awards totalling $13.4
million. The others were MIT, Harvard, Brown, and Chicago.

- Need for the program is empha
sized by the exacting demands of
advanced missile and other so
phisticated weapons systems, the
Defense Department announced.
STANFORD expects to appoint
some 17 new faculty members and
8 research associates over the
four-year period and obtain ex
tensive specialized equipment to
increase research in solid state
physics, chemistry, electronics,
metallurgy and ceramics.
About 60 graduate students are
to participate.
A Center for Materials Re
search will be established in part
of a proposed $2.5 million build
ing, a large portion of which is
to be financed through Stanford’s
current PACE campaign to raise
$lOO million.
INVESTIGATIONS will be car
ried on in the laboratories of sev
eral departments and the whole
program will be administrated by
an inter-departmental executive
committee Robert A. Huggins of
the Stanford faculty has been ap
pointed chairman and director of
the center.
