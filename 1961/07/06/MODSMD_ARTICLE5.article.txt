# I-Clubbers Plan Active Summer Q.
## 
### 
Stanford’s International Club
plans to remain just as active this
summer as it normally is during
the regular school year.
Coffee hours are planned for
each Friday between 5 and 6 p.m.
The hours are informal and pro
vide an opportunity to meet new
and old friends.
BOTH American and foreign
students may take part in all
functions put on by the club.
Each Saturday night, from 8:30
to midnight, the club will present
an “Evening Abroad,” featuring
food and entertainment by stu
dents from various foreign na
tions.
This week it’s an evening abroad
in Swdeden.
The International Center, lo
cated across from Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, houses the I-Club. It
is open daily from 8 a.m. to mid
night.
THE PATIO and downstairs
rooms of the house are always
available for informal socializing,
bridge games, reading and so
forth.
The resident hostess, Gail Haf
ner, will assist students who wish
to plan any gathering at the cen
ter.
In addition to the normal activi
ties, there will be three nationality
dinners this summer on Sunday
evenings. Cost is $1.25 and sign
up lists are posted at the center.
