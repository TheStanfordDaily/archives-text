# Watermelon Feast Saturday
## Women's Gym Scene of Sloppy, Delicious Event 
### 
Hundreds of pounds of watermelon —that delightful summer treat
—will be consumed Saturday at the first of two summer Water
melon Feeds.

The always-popular affair is scheduled from 2 to 5 p.m. on the
rolling expanse of green lawn next to the Women's Gym.

Students, faculty and their fam
ilies are eligible to come and en
joy the watermelon—for FREE

dents.

THE EVENT is being spon
sored and organized by members
of the Summer Legislature.
A number of games and ath
letic contests are in the plans for
the entertainment of all.

SUMMER Legislature Presi
dent Jock Mcßaine, licking his
lips in anticipation, reports that
several hundred pounds of the
green melon have been ordered
and will be on hand for the con
sumption of those who attend.
“I urge all those interested in
an afternoon of fun and good
watermelon to turn out,” Mcßaine
urged.
In keeping with the general
tone of informality in the summer
session, the dress will be informal.
T-shirts, bermudas, etc. will be the
uniform of the day.

THE NEXT watermelon feed is
scheduled for Aug. 5 at the same
time and place.
In the past summer sessions,
the watermelon feeds have proved
to be just about the most popular
event on the summer social calen
dar.

Married students and faculty
particularly enjoy the feed be
cause they can bring the kids
along and who enjoys water
melon more than kids.
