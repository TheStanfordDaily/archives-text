# GALLAGHER POSTSCRIPT
## From 'Rivets' to... 
### 
A touching postscript to the tragic death of a Stanford scientist
last April 13 recently turned up among the gifts presented to the
University.
It involves the scientist’s dog, which survived him by only seven
weeks, and a check for $46.57.
The money was sent as a contribution to the Philip B. Gallagher
Memorial Book Fund established by friends of the solar re
search specialist who was electrocuted when he accidental ched
a high tension lead in the laboratory where he was at work.
A BRIEF note accompanying the check from the Stanford Elec
tronics Laboratories explained;
“This contribution is being made in the name of ‘Rivets,’ the late
SEL mascot who was formerly Dr. Gallagher’s dog and was adopted
by the Laboratory staff.
“The money is the amount left in his care account at the time of
his death. J. A. Hofmann.’’
RIVETS, a black and white, short-haired, long-eared dog of du
bious lineage, died June 2 of cancer. He had been ailing for some
time prior to his master’s death, and an exploratory operation re
vealed the cause, Hofmann said.
Though Gallagher was his nominal master, the source of his
meals, and the owner of his favorite automobile, Rivets was at home
with the entire Electronics Laboratories’ staff, spent 90 per cent of
his time there, and liked to sleep peacefully through lectures.
Arrangements were made with the Gallagher family by the staff
to adopt the dog. A box for small contributions for his maintenance
was quickly filled by sympathetic friends on the staff who also were
missing his master.
THERE WAS time to use only part of the initial donations.
Like other donations to special funds at Stanford, this unusual
one by the SEL staff will have a part in the Stanford PACE program.
Under the Ford Foundation offer to grant up to $25 million to the
University on a one-dollar-for-three matching basis for money raised
in five years by the University, Rivets’ posthmous gift will “earn’’
about 15 Ford dollars.
