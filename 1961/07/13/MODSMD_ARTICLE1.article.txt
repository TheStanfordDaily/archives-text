# FARM DRYING UP
## Water Shortage 'Still Critical' 
### 
Hit by the worst water shortage in its history, Stan
ford heads into its fourth month of water rationing Sat
urday with its wells and lakes drying up.
“The water situation at Stanford is still critical,” S. F.
Post, assistant business manager and director of the
University’s physical plant, said Monday.
"The wells are going dry and the lakes are going
down,” he explained.
STANFORD went on official water rationing April 14
as the Farm already was feeling the effects of one of the
driest years in Peninsula history.
Rainfall in the just-completed rainfall year at the
official Stanford gauge measured 10.08 inches com
pared with a normal of between 15 and 16 inches.
What makes the situation critical is that the rain this
year came in “dribbles,” according to Carl Maier, assist
ant superintendent of buildings and grounds, and the
fact that the area is in its third straight year of drought.
“THIS IS the worst year we’ve ever experienced,”
Maier declared.
He noted that both the lakes which give Stanford
most of its water are very low, and getting lower.
Searsville Lake, which has a capacity of 265 million

gallons, is down to about 100 million, Maier said, and Felt
Lake, which can hold 131 million gallons, has less than
70 million in it.
STANFORD has three wells drawing water, with a
fourth one being reset so it will reach to the lowering
water level.
But “it is not certain that these [wells] will be able
to produce through fall,” Post said.
He reported that the University has been buying
water from the San Francisco Hetch-Hetchy system for
three weeks.
And he added that “with the wells failing it may be
necessary” to charge increased rates for water to campus
consumers. The amount of increase would depend on the
water used.
POST IS planning to send all residents a letter soon
explaining the situation, and urging them to take all pos
sible measures to conserve water.
Since April 14, campus residents have been on a strict
schedule of lawn-watering, and it has been requested
that cars be washed by buckets of water, instead of using
hoses.
Post noted that there has been a noticeable drop in

the use of water for irrigation since rationing was im
posed. A new section of pipe connecting a two-mlllion
gallon reservoir on Gerona Road with the Felt-Searsville
system recently was installed, mainly for fire protection.
MAIER said rationing of water probably will be in
effect until the first solid rainfall, which normally comes
in late November or early December.

Noting “we’ve been very fortunate so far” in avoiding
major grass fires, Stanford Fire Chief John Marston
reminded that the grass on the 8,800-acre campus is
tinder dry.

He has been sending the Stanford department’s pick
up truck out patrolling the back country of the campus
in an effort to catch any blazes before they got out of
hand.

THE DEPARTMENT also has cut new fire breaks
and fire trails around campus, he said,
Stanford is not alone in feeling the pinch, brought on
by scarce rainfall and high temperatures. Santa Clara
County, the one Stanford Is in, and neighboring San
Mateo County both are caught in the driest year in their
history.
