# SLASSU to Examine Libe Hours
## 
### 
Stanford’s Summer Legislature
(SLASSU) Monday night decided
to look into the hours of the Main
Library and ask for their exten
sion, if Library officials are will
ing.
Various members said they had
heard complaints that the Re
served Book Room closes so early
—5 p.m.—that students with jobs
cannot visit the RBR before it
closes for the day.
President Jock Mcßaine ap
pointed Debbie Dexter to talk
with Library officials to see if
some solution could be found.
She will report back at next
week’s regular Legislature meet
ing.
THE all-campus dinner - dance
scheduled for Saturday, July 29,
also came up for discussion.
Lawrie Chickering and Dicky
Barkley reported that they hope
to obtain either the Cliff House
or the neighboring Surf Club for
the annual event.
Wherever it is held, the dinner
dance will run from 7 p.m. to 1
a.m., with dinner from 7 to 9 p.m.
and dancing from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
Tickets will be $6 for the din
ner and dance, or $2.50 for the
dance alone.
A BAND still is to be signed
for the dance. It was expected
that the place would be definite
by tomorrow, with ticket sales
starting soon. Last year the
dance was held at the Cliff
House.
The dance is open to all sum
mer students.
SLASSU also appropriated ad
ditional money for the Interna
tional Club to put on its Friday
coffee hours and its Saturday
“Evenings Abroad.’’
The group also voted approval
of John Gallagher as the Summer
Legislature representative from
the School of Education’s Educa
tion Council.
