# Vive Le Happy Hour! Tomorrow, Citizens!
## 
### 
Stanford students will stretch
their hands across the sea to their
brothers in France tomorrow
when the one and only Happy
Hour of the summer is held to
celebrate “Bastille Day.’’
Wishing to commemorate the
occasion in proper style, the Sum
mer Legislature hopes to secure
a large French flag, and perhaps
French entertainment.

AT ANY' rate, those thinking of
attending can be assured of a good
time.

For those new to Stanford, a
Happy Hour is a time when stu
dents gather together for one—or
two—or three—hours of good fel
lowship, aided by liquid refresh
ment.

The Happy Hour will be held at
Rossetti’s Alpine Beer Garden-

better known as Zott’s —from 3
to 6 p.m.

Zott’s can be reached by follow
ing Alpine Road, turning left at
the main intersection just past the
Stanford golf course.
For ladies of Lagunita Court,
Stanford men will provide trans
portation via automobile, with
rides leaving from 4 to 5 in front
of Lag.
EVERYONE on campus is in
vited to the affair, although it will
help to have a card of identifica
tion or French citizenship papers.
The event is being sponsored by
that happy French group, the
Stanford Summer Legislature,
Vice President Peter Erlin notes
that tomorrow also falls in “Old
Fashioned Sidewalk Days,” “Pick
les for Picnic Time,” and “Kraut
for Dinner Days.” If any other
reason is needed to celebrate,
there are 163 days to Christmas.
