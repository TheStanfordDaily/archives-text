# SLASSU Told No Change in Library Hours
## 
### 
Stanford’s summer library
hours won’t be changed unless a
definite need is proved, it was re
ported to Summer Legislature
(SLASSU) at its regular meeting
Monday night.
Graduate Representative Deb
bie Dexter said she had talked to
Elmer Grieder, acting director of
libraries, about the closing hour
of the Reserve Book Room, now
open until 5 p.m.
GRIEDER said he felt chang
ing the hours so the RBR would
be open in the evening, from 7 to
9 p.m. as was suggested, would
put more of a hardship on more
people than the present situation
does.
He noted that people who now
can check a book Out over night
before leaving campus for the
day would have to return in the
evening to do this if the RBR
were open at night.
SINCE most of the summer
students live off campus, this
would present problems to many
of them, particularly those with
out transportation, Miss Dexter
reported to SLASSU.
She said library officials urged
anyone who is unable to get to
the RBR in its regular hours to
see them to work out special ar-
I’angements.
Library officials “want to
know” how many students can’t
reach the RBR before it closes,
she said. A change might be
made in the hours if a definite
need for such a move was proved,
Miss Dexter said library officials
told her.
