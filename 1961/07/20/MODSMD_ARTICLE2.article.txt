# 'Intimate Relations' Termed 'Excellent'
## 
### BRIDGET HURSLEY DOBSON 
The Stanford Players’ Contemporary Summer Theater Workshop
did an excellent job last weekend in their production of Jean Coc
teau’s “Intimate Relations.”
The play was the first in a series by modern playwrights includ
ing Bertolt Brecht, Eugene lonesco, Jean Anouilh, and Friederich
Durrenmatt to be produced by the Players.
FOR THE MOST PART the Players did a superior job of acting,
under the fine direction of James Kerans. The performance was
done “theater in the round,” a stylization which might be questioned
for this particular production in the Little Theater.
The settings by Wendell Cole, the lighting by Paul Landry, and
the costumes by Irene Griffin contributed toward making the pro
duction thoroughly enjoyable.
The Cocteau play opens in the bedroom of Yvonne (Lisa Lau
terer), a diabetic who has just taken an overdose of insulin. She is
frantic with worry over her son Michel (Phillip Angeloff), who has
not returned home that night.
She is attended by her old-maid sister, Leo (Marrietta Schmidt),
and her neglected husband, Georges (Ron Feinberg).
DURING THE COURSE of the play it is revealed that Michel
has fallen in love with a girl, Madeline (Sherrie Dobrott), with whom
he had spent the night. Coincidentally Georges, Michel’s father, has
fallen in love with the same girl.
The psychological “disorder” both inside each character and in
his relationships to others is the theme of the play. Yvonne is
thwarted in her incestuous affection for her son.
GEORGES IS REJECTED both as husband and lover. Leo is
jealous of her sister Yvonne. This “disorder” is revealed in the physi
cal disarray of the house as well as in the psychological turmoil that
the individuals endure.
It seems that Cocteau conceives "disorder” essential to the human
condition, for it is not until Yvonne commits suicide that for a
moment “all is order.”
