# Linear Accelerator Passes House; Fate Rests in Senate
## 
### 
Stanford’s proposed $ll4 mil
lion, two-mile-long linear acceler
ator has passed the House, but its
final fate rests with the Senate
and political give-and-take.
The lower house last week ap
proved construction of the mam
moth electronic “gun,” which is
labeled Project M (for Monster).

Whether the Senate passes it
will depend on the outcome of
political maneuvers designed to
rescue President Kennedy’s pro
posal to convert a new nuclear
reactor at Hanford, Wash., into
the largest atomic power plant in
the world.

BOTH OF the projects are in
cluded in a measure which would
authorize $226 million in new con
struction by the Atomic Energy
Commission.

When the House passed the ac
celerator, however, it junked by
a 176-140 vote the Hanford proj
ect.
This irked Senate Democrats,
led by Sen. Clinton Anderson of
New Mexico, according to in
formed sources, and they may
try to strike out the Stanford
project and approve the Hanford
one when the bill comes up in the
upper house.
THUS, in conference a compro
mise would be suggested which
would find both projects in the
bill submitted for final action.
But if this didn’t work, both
projects would die.
More than $3 million has been
spent on studies for Project M,
which would be located in the
foothills behind Stanford.
Senate Democrats stalled ac
tion on the accelerator while the
Eisenhower Administration was
opposing the Hanford project.
WITH THE switch in adminis

trations, the Joint Atomic Energy
Committee finally agreed this
year to Project M.
Speaking on the floor of the
House on July 13, Rep. Chet Holi
fleld of the Joint Atomic Energy
Commission pointed out, “We
want to go further into the ex
ploration of matter, and it takes
this giant machine to do that.
“As far as I know, there is no
objection on the part of the com
mittee; there is no objection in
the scientific world. There is
great enthusiasm for us to go
ahead and explore further some
of the properties of matter which
we have not been able to explore
with existing scientific machines.”

try to strike out the Stanford
project and approve the Hanford
one when the bill comes up in the
upper house.
THUS, in conference a compro
mise would be suggested which
would find both projects in the
bill submitted for final action.
But if this didn’t work, both
projects would die.
More than $3 million has been
spent on studies for Project M,
which would be located in the
foothills behind Stanford.
Senate Democrats stalled ac
tion on the accelerator while the
Eisenhower Administration was
opposing the Hanford project.
WITH THE switch in adminis

trations, the Joint Atomic Energy
Committee finally agreed this
year to Project M.
Speaking on the floor of the
House on July 13, Rep. Chet Holi
fleld of the Joint Atomic Energy
Commission pointed out, “We
want to go further into the ex
ploration of matter, and it takes
this giant machine to do that.
“As far as I know, there is no
objection on the part of the com
mittee; there is no objection in
the scientific world. There is
great enthusiasm for us to go
ahead and explore further some
of the properties of matter which
we have not been able to explore
with existing scientific machines.”
Stanford’s proposed $ll4 mil
lion, two-mile-long linear acceler
ator has passed the House, but its
final fate rests with the Senate
and political give-and-take.
The lower house last week ap
proved construction of the mam
moth electronic “gun,” which is
labeled Project M (for Monster).

Whether the Senate passes it
will depend on the outcome of
political maneuvers designed to
rescue President Kennedy’s pro
posal to convert a new nuclear
reactor at Hanford, Wash., into
the largest atomic power plant in
the world.

BOTH OF the projects are in
cluded in a measure which would
authorize $226 million in new con
struction by the Atomic Energy
Commission.

When the House passed the ac
celerator, however, it junked by
a 176-140 vote the Hanford proj
ect.
This irked Senate Democrats,
led by Sen. Clinton Anderson of
New Mexico, according to in
formed sources, and they may
try to strike out the Stanford
project and approve the Hanford
one when the bill comes up in the
upper house.
