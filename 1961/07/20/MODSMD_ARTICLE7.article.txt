“Much of the charm of summer
quarter lies in the fact that the
atmosphere is a relaxed one and
that the student body is not being
continuously pressured to attend
University-sponsored functions.
“REALIZING that the summer
student body has an average age
of about 28 years and that its in
terests are chiefly academic, the
student government plans only
one event to which admission is
charged.
“That event is the traditional
summer dinner-dance, which is
upcoming on Saturday, July 29.
“This year we offer an evening
at the Hilton Inn, complete with
a full dinner, dancing, and a floor
show. Tickets are available at a
very reasonable cost for the din
ner-dance or for the dance alone.
“We are sure that students of

the Evening,’ and we hope you
will join in the spirit of the occa
sion and buy a ticket for two."

“Much of the charm of summer
quarter lies in the fact that the
atmosphere is a relaxed one and
that the student body is not being
continuously pressured to attend
University-sponsored functions.
“REALIZING that the summer
student body has an average age
of about 28 years and that its in
terests are chiefly academic, the
student government plans only
one event to which admission is
charged.

upcoming on Saturday, July 29.
“This year we offer an evening
at the Hilton Inn, complete with
a full dinner, dancing, and a floor
show. Tickets are available at a
very reasonable cost for the din
ner-dance or for the dance alone.
“We are sure that students of
all ages, both married and single,
will enjoy Stanford’s ‘Gone for
the Evening,’ and we hope you
will join in the spirit of the occa
sion and buy a ticket for two."
