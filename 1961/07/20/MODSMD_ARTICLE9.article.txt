Stanford student body.
Site preparations for the two

an all-campus community center,
began June 26.
The structure, architecturally
keyed to Stanford’s buff walls,
archways and red tile, will supply
food, services and programs rang
ing from bowling and bridge to
Bach and Beethoven, with art
shows, conferences and “bull ses
sions” thrown in.

The 74,000 - square - foot struc
ture will be the key building in
the Student Activities Center,
which comprises Dinkelspiel, the
bookstore, post office, the Wo
men’s Clubhouse and the existing
Union.
THE landscaped mall which
eventually will connect all the
buildings in the Center has been
designed by landscape architect
Thomas Church.
Terrace fronting on the mall
and the oak grove to the rear will
provide outdoor eating and loung
ing space.
The upper level will contain
student offices, the Associated
Students business office, music
listening and reading rooms, ad
ministrative offices, an informa
tion desk, box office, lobby and
display gallery areas, meeting
and conference rooms, and
lounges.
THE LOWER level will contain
bowling lanes, billiards and table
tennis facilities, a barbershop, a
travel agency, store, and large
dining room.
Programmed for the future are
additional student offices, meet
ing rooms and a large banquet
ballroom.
