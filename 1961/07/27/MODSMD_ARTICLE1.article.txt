not attend Stanford during the
regular school year.
THERE WERE 1,621 men and
697 women among the regular
Farm students, and 498 men and
489 women among the non-ma
triculated students—a much more
favorable ratio of men to women,
veterans of Stanford’s normal
three - men - for - each-girl situation
pointed out.
Graduate students make up the
largest group among matriculat
ed Stanford students, 1,157 of
them studying here this summer.

290, sophomores following with
284, seniors at 122 and freshmen
at 63.
Hall said persons attending the
large number of summer confer
ences here who register for some
credit probably will bring the
final total of students registered
for credit this summer to about
