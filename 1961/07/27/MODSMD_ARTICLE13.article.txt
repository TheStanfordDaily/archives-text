# Panofsky on Atom Panel
## 
### 
Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky, head
of Stanford’s High-Energy Phys
ics Laboratory, is chairman of an
11-scientist panel which is trying
to determine if Russia has been
testing nuclear weapons, it was
revealed last week.

President Kennedy released the
names of the group, which has
been meeting secretly since early
July.
The 41-year-old Panofsky is a
veteran of international nuclear
talks, having headed the U.S. sci
entific delegation to the 1959 nu
clear test ban talks in Geneva.

The panel’s report will help the
President decide whether the
United States should resume test
ing nuclear weapons.
Kennedy told a June 28 news
conference he would appoint the
panel to investigate whether the
Soviets have been testing nuclear
weapons on the sly.
Besides trying to find out
whether Russia is testing, the
group also was assigned the task
of determining whether Russia
could be testing in secret and to
what extent such tests might be
concealed.

White House press secretary
Pierre Salinger said the scientists
began meeting several days after
the press conference, but would
not say where they were meeting
or when they would report.
