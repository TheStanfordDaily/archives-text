# Players in Hit, Miss-Reviewer

### BRIDGET DOBSON 
The two plays produced by the
Stanford Players’ Contemporary
Summer Theater Workshop last
week end stood in sharp contrast
to one another.
‘‘Victims of Duty” by Eugene
lonesco is a play about social and
psychological contradictions. It is
an extremely complex production,
and the Players handled it su
perbly.
The acting was of professional
caliber. Barbara Greer was ex
cellent in the role of Madeline.
She was convincing in each facet
of her multi-facet personality,
from nagging wife to vamp.
AND throughout the play she
demonstrated a good sense of
comic timing as well as a good
deal of grace and charm.
Equally successful was Leslie
Rabkin in the role of Choubert.
He was pathetic and funny at
once, and he appeared to be type
cast in the Chaplinesque role.
John Kulsar as the detective was
certainly more than competent.
Under the fine direction of Juris
Svendsen difficult staging prob
lems were cleverly handled.
Setting by Wendell Cole and
costumes by Irene Griffin were
simple and flexible. The entire
production was thoroughly en
joyable.
“THE MEASURES Taken” by
Bertolt Brecht is an austere, sol
emn play of Communist disci
pline. It is a difficult play for a
college theater group to attempt.
And, indeed, the production did
not live up to the potential of the
play.
The Brecht work is a somber
tragedy of great emotional inten
sity except for a few brief and
sporadic moments.
The ‘‘Control Chorus” was an
adequate representation of the
Communist “conscience.”
BUT THE “Agitators" looked
and acted more like football he
roes than Communist party work
ers. The performance of Ingrid
Hulanicki as the only girl agita
tor was most consistently good.
The direction of Susan James
was good at times, but for the
most part it did not make the best
use of the theater-in-the-round.
Setting by Edmund Roney, cos
tumes by Miss Griffin and light
ing by Paul Landry were starkly
simple and quite appropriate.
