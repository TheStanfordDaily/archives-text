# Tresidder Union Dedicated
## 
### 
Beneath a large, cool oak tree, a group of Stan
ford trustees, high administration officials and
just plain students last Thursday dedicated the
site of the Donald B. Tresidder Memorial Union.
The brief noontime ceremony was held on a
grassy plot in the Dinkelspiel Auditorium parking
lot. In attendance were Mrs. Mary C. Tresidder,
Stanford President Wallace Sterling, Thomas P.
Pike, president of the Board of Trustees, and a
number of other trustees.

Shown in the picture above are Mrs. Tresidder,
Pike, and W. P. Fuller, Jr., president of the board
while Mrs. Tresidder’s husband was president of
Stanford, from 1943 to January 1948.
The new $2,675,000 community center will be
the key in the gradually forming Student Activi

ties Center. Site preparation for the union began
June 26.
At the ceremony, all the speakers lauded Tre
sidder for his keen interest in Stanford students.
He “is legend at Stanford for his interest and faith
in students,” Pike said.
Sterling noted that he had met the University’s
fourth head only four times, “but through his
work I’ve met him again and again.”
Outgoing student body president Larry Royse
noted that Tresidder’s “door was always open” to
students.
Pike declared it was fitting that the long
awaited union be named for Tresidder, for “he had
a great love for Stanford University.”
