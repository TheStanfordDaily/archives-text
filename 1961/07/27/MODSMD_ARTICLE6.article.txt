SUMMER student body presi
dent Jock Mcßaine urges all those
interested in an enjoyable eve
ning to “join in the spirit of the
occasion and buy a ticket for
two.”

He adds: “Realizing that the
summer student body has an av
erage of about 28 years and that
its interests are chiefly academic,
the student government plans
only one event to which admis
sion is charged.
“This year we offer an evening
at the Hilton Inn, complete with
a full dinner, dancing and a floor
show. Tickets are available at a
very reasonable cost for the din
ner-dance or for the dance alone.”
