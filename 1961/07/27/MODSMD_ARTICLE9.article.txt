# STANFORD
## Smasher Approved By Senate 
### 
Project M —Stanford’s proposed
two-mile, $ll4 million linear ac
celerator- —was approved by the
Senate last week and the bill con
taining the appropriation for it
was expected to come up for a
final vote late this week.
While unanimously approving
the Stanford atom smasher, the
Senate delayed final action on the
Atomic Energy Commission’s au
thorization bill for 1962, which
contains the Stanford funds.
A joint Senate-House confer
ence was to discuss the bill, since
the measure passed by the lower
chamber and the one okayed by
the Senate differed.
SENATORS rejected, by a 53-36
vote, an amendment to strike a
proposal for a $95 million nuclear
power reactor at Hanford, Wash.,
from their bill.
The House approved the AEC
bill and the accelerator but dump
ed the power plant.
Thus, a conference was neces
sary for this week to find a com
promise, since the AEC bill must
be given the nod before funds for
Project M can be appropriated
for the 1961-62 fiscal year.
THE linear accelerator, which
would be the world’s largest, has
been included in the AEC authori
zation bill for the past three years
but has been held up in the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy un
til details of the project were
worked out.
Both the Eisenhower and Ken
nedy administrations have en
dorsed the project, which has re
ceived strong support from scien
tists.
Congress last year appropri
ated $3 million for preliminary
work.
Project M would be built on
Stanford lands parallel to Sand
Hill Road. Construction is ex
pected to take six years.
