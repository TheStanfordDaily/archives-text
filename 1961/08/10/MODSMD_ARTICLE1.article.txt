# Watermelon Draws Everybody!
## Ail Sizes Hit Saturday Feed 
### 
As the pictures at the left in
dicate, kids of all sizes were
drawn to last Saturday’s water
melon feed.
Just over 1,200 pounds of the
luscious green summer treat was
gobbled up by the students (or
future students) who turned out
for the feast.
The affair was the last func
tion sponsored this quarter by
the Summer Legislature, and the
second of two watermelon feasts.
This was good news to Pete
Erlin, summer vice-president and
head watermelon-cutter.
Erlin sliced his finger a bit
with the machete he used to slice
the watermelon and required two
stitches to close the wound. Un
daunted, he returned to the table
and chopped up the last melons
in perfect style.
Unfortunately, the Weekly’s
amateur photographer (who is
normally a reporter) was too
busy eating watermelon to get
the names of the people in the
photographs.
