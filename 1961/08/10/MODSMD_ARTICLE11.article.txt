# Stanford 'Sleuths' Take Step in Important 'Case'
## 
### 
A great step toward understanding the mystery of "superconduc
tivity —one of the most puzzling phenomena in modern physics
has been reported by two Stanford scientists.
Their discovery also helps explain "superfluidity" and related
oddities of super-cooled materials (near absolute zero, -459 F.) and

constitutes a major advance in a
world wide scientific frontal at
tack on the problem.
THE WORK is described in the
current issue (July 15) of Physi
cal Review Letters by Bascom S.
Deaver Jr., a graduate student,
and Prof. William M. Fairbank.
In an experiment associates de
scribe as “elegant” because of its
simplicity and clarity, the Stan
ford investigators demonstrated
that a superconductor will accept
electric current only in discrete
quantities, or "packages,” of cer
tain predictable sizes. Part of a
package won’t do.
That is the key to a 50-year-old
mystery of why certain mate
rials. cooled to near-absolute-zero
temperature, appear to lose all
resistance to the flow of electric
current.
IN THE superconductive state,
electric current introduced into a
ring of the material continues to
flow even after the electric
source is removed. It continues
for weeks, months, even years
without appreciable loss of
strength—a kind of electrical per
petual motion.
The Deaver - Fairbank discov
ery showed that the magnetic
field produced by this current is
“quantizex”—that is, its strength
can be increased only in steps of
certain predictable sizes. The su
perconductor will accept only the
full package of current required
to make the step.
This indicates, according to sci
entists, that all electrons in a su
perconductor not only are paired
but also move in unison like
marching soldiers.
TRYING TO inject less than a
full current package is like try
ing to throw the electrons out of
step. A superconductor won’t al
low it.
The unified, marching concept
of electrons contrasts with the
ordinarily chaotic state of the
material. At normal temperature
its electrons would be moving in
all directions, completely inde
pendent of one another.
Random movement of elec
trons is believed to be the reason
for electrical resistance. When
unified electrons all move togeth
er, as in superconductivity, resist
ance vanishes.
ANOTHER ODDITY of the
phenomenon is that good conduc
tors seem to make poor super
conductors, and vice versa. Sil
ver, copper and gold won’t turn
superconductive, while such ordi
narily poor conductors as tin and
lead are among the easiest to con
vert.

world wide scientific frontal at
tack on the problem.
THE WORK is described in the
current issue (July 15) of Physi
cal Review Letters by Bascom S.
Deaver Jr., a graduate student,
and Prof. William M. Fairbank.
In an experiment associates de
scribe as “elegant” because of its
simplicity and clarity, the Stan
ford investigators demonstrated
that a superconductor will accept
electric current only in discrete
quantities, or "packages,” of cer
tain predictable sizes. Part of a
package won’t do.
That is the key to a 50-year-old
mystery of why certain mate
rials. cooled to near-absolute-zero
temperature, appear to lose all
resistance to the flow of electric
current.
IN THE superconductive state,
electric current introduced into a
ring of the material continues to
flow even after the electric
source is removed. It continues
for weeks, months, even years
without appreciable loss of
strength—a kind of electrical per
petual motion.
The Deaver - Fairbank discov
ery showed that the magnetic
field produced by this current is
“quantizex”—that is, its strength
can be increased only in steps of
certain predictable sizes. The su
perconductor will accept only the
full package of current required
to make the step.
This indicates, according to sci
entists, that all electrons in a su
perconductor not only are paired
but also move in unison like
marching soldiers.
TRYING TO inject less than a
full current package is like try
ing to throw the electrons out of
step. A superconductor won’t al
low it.
The unified, marching concept
of electrons contrasts with the
ordinarily chaotic state of the
material. At normal temperature
its electrons would be moving in
all directions, completely inde
pendent of one another.
Random movement of elec
trons is believed to be the reason
for electrical resistance. When
unified electrons all move togeth
er, as in superconductivity, resist
ance vanishes.
ANOTHER ODDITY of the
phenomenon is that good conduc
tors seem to make poor super
conductors, and vice versa. Sil
ver, copper and gold won’t turn
superconductive, while such ordi
narily poor conductors as tin and
lead are among the easiest to con
vert.
A great step toward understanding the mystery of "superconduc
tivity —one of the most puzzling phenomena in modern physics
has been reported by two Stanford scientists.
Their discovery also helps explain "superfluidity" and related
oddities of super-cooled materials (near absolute zero, -459 F.) and

constitutes a major advance in a
world wide scientific frontal at
tack on the problem.
