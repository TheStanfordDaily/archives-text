# Last Play Continues; Delightful-Reviewer

### BRIDGET DOBSON 
The Stanford Players ring
down the curtain on a summer
of contemporary plays when
they present Friedrich Duerren
matt's "The Deadly Game" to
night, tomorrow and Saturday at
8:30 p.m. in the Little Theater.
Tickets, at $1.50, were avail
able at press time Tuesday at the
Memorial Auditorium box office.

‘“The Deadly Game” is not only
deadly, it’s delightful.
The Friedrich Duerrenmatt play
—which will run at the Little
Theater today, tomorrow and Sat
urday combines suspense and
comedy. Under the direction of
William Melnitz, the Stanford
Players make murder fun.
The situation of the play is in
trinsically amusing. Howard
Trapp, an American salesman,
wanders unsuspectingly into a
home where three Swiss retired
criminal lawyers are playing a
game of criminal law.
BUT THE GAME turns out to
be for real. Trapp finds himself
"trapped” in a situation in which
he is being tried for murder by
three elderly experts.
As Howard Trapp, Philip
Schultz plays the role with in
sight into the full potential of the
character. He realizes the com
edy without diluting the suspense
a pretty good trick for any
actor.
The jovial host for the deadly
game is played by Ronald Fein
berg, who a few weeks ago ap

peared in the Players’ production
of “Intimate Relations.” He is
the complete host, from charm to
cognac.
WHAT’S MORE, he appears to
be enjoying himself as much as
the audience enjoys him. While
he is functioning as the judge in
the murder trial, he lends convic
tion to the proceedings by play
ing it straight. This measurably
adds to the overall comic effect.
As the prosecutor, Ralph Mc-
Cormic is delightfully treacher
ous.
Intellectual, witty, and blood
thirsty, he pursues the “criminal”
with amusing relentlessness. He
adroitly exposes Trapp’s “uncon
scious guilt.” At the same time,
he reveals similar guilt in him
self and his cohorts.
ROBERT Scholte as the de
fense attorney gives the role a
lovely, devilish charm. He benev
olently sooths the ruffled Trapp,
ardently protects Trapp during
the trial, and wickedly congratu
lates the prosecutor on having
won the case. He does skillful
justice to a complex, difficult
role.
Jack Schmidt is competent as
the arthritic, over-anxious execu
tioner.
IN this reviewer’s opinion, the
play is the best production of the
Players this summer. If you can
leave the theater without feeling
a little guilty of some of the "un
conscious crimes” for which
Howard Trapp was convicted, I’ll
be surprised. I couldn’t.
Tickets at $1.50 are still avail
able at the Memorial Auditorium
box office. Hurry.

‘“The Deadly Game” is not only
deadly, it’s delightful.
The Friedrich Duerrenmatt play
—which will run at the Little
Theater today, tomorrow and Sat
urday combines suspense and
comedy. Under the direction of
William Melnitz, the Stanford
Players make murder fun.
The situation of the play is in
trinsically amusing. Howard
Trapp, an American salesman,
wanders unsuspectingly into a
home where three Swiss retired
criminal lawyers are playing a
game of criminal law.
BUT THE GAME turns out to
be for real. Trapp finds himself
"trapped” in a situation in which
he is being tried for murder by
three elderly experts.
As Howard Trapp, Philip
Schultz plays the role with in
sight into the full potential of the
character. He realizes the com
edy without diluting the suspense
a pretty good trick for any
actor.
The jovial host for the deadly
game is played by Ronald Fein
berg, who a few weeks ago ap

peared in the Players’ production
of “Intimate Relations.” He is
the complete host, from charm to
cognac.
WHAT’S MORE, he appears to
be enjoying himself as much as
the audience enjoys him. While
he is functioning as the judge in
the murder trial, he lends convic
tion to the proceedings by play
ing it straight. This measurably
adds to the overall comic effect.
As the prosecutor, Ralph Mc-
Cormic is delightfully treacher
ous.
Intellectual, witty, and blood
thirsty, he pursues the “criminal”
with amusing relentlessness. He
adroitly exposes Trapp’s “uncon
scious guilt.” At the same time,
he reveals similar guilt in him
self and his cohorts.
ROBERT Scholte as the de
fense attorney gives the role a
lovely, devilish charm. He benev
olently sooths the ruffled Trapp,
ardently protects Trapp during
the trial, and wickedly congratu
lates the prosecutor on having
won the case. He does skillful
justice to a complex, difficult
role.
Jack Schmidt is competent as
the arthritic, over-anxious execu
tioner.
IN this reviewer’s opinion, the
play is the best production of the
Players this summer. If you can
leave the theater without feeling
a little guilty of some of the "un
conscious crimes” for which
Howard Trapp was convicted, I’ll
be surprised. I couldn’t.
Tickets at $1.50 are still avail
able at the Memorial Auditorium
box office. Hurry.
