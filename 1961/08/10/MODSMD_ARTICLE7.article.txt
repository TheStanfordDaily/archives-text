### 
Three former Stanford students are now in Africa preparing for
teaching jobs there under the International Cooperation Administra

They are Joan Hoffman of San Carlos, Richard R. Hawkins of San
Rafael and Richard L. Kimball of Saratoga.

Miss Hoffman was a graduate
student in education; Hawkins
and Kimball were members of

THE THKEE help make up a
contingent of 15 former Stanford

A UNIQUE exchange has been
worked out for Hilary Sims who

Stanford, and Epafuladito M. Ki
wanuka, a student at Makarere
