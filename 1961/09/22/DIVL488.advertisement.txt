WELCOME FRESHMEN!
iwice Welcome little assets in the Cold War! i
In if e bad old days your entry into college would have been for selfish
reasons of personal development and advancement.
But now in the Brave New World you are about to become a part of
the arsenal of Democracy: A National Resource, another statistic for Our Side.
So learn your lessons well. Think for yourself but not too much. And
learn how to launch ever larger missiles (guided and misguided) as both "we"
(The Good Guys) and they" (The Bad Guys) clutter up space with pie in the
sky, diverting attention from the unsolved problems back on earth.
To do this you will need to read books (On Thermonuclear War; The
Organization Man, A Forward Strategy for America; etc.) both recommended
and required.
And that's where we come in you'll find all the inexpensive paperbacks
(plus foreign and domestic periodicals, art prints, IP records) at
Kepler's Books & Magazines
(The Peninsula s largest paperback bookstore without a
fallout shelter)
