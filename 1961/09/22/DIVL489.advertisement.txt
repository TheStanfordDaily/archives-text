‘Talking road”
that can save
your life!
The visibility is almost zero and
ahead is a sharp curve.
Suddenly, beneath your wheels, the
road says: “Slow down!'’lt does this
by sending sound and low vibrations
through your automobile’s frame.
You get the message and cut your
speed.
This road warning system —called
a “rumble strip”—cut accidents in
test areas by nearly two-thirds. It
is made chiefly from a new kind
of plastic developed by Standard’s
scientists...one so rugged that it will
stand up to the pounding of the
heaviest traffic.
The rumble strip is part of Standard’s
continuing interest in traffic safety,
which includes driver training, seat
belts in Company cars, educational
films for schools, and widespread
distribution of safety tips.
The tough plastic which makes the
rumble strip possible is only one of
a wide variety that our scientists
are creating to help manufacturers
bring you new and better products.
They include super-strong plastics for
car bodies; tough, versatile plastics
for building materials; long-lasting
plastic fibers to increase the durability
of everything from clothing to tires.
