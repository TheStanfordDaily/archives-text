a mathematician works in the mainstream at IBM
Advanced data processing systems whether designed
for business, industry, science, or government have
been made possible in large part by the talents and abili
ties of the mathematician.
Harold Mechanic, for instance, is working in areas of
system simulation, interesting work in building mathe
matical models to study as an example the performance
of proposed Tele-Processing* systems. After transform
ing the models into computer language, numerous pos
sible system configurations were fed into a giant computer
to determine an optimum arrangement of components.
Thus, like many mathematicians at IBM, Harold Mechanic
is able to use the computer as a tool to advance both
theory and technique of systems analysis.
