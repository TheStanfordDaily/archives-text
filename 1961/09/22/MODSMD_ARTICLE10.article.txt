# Cards Open Grid Slate Vs. Tulane
## 
### 
Shooting for their first win in
two years, the Stanford Indians
open the 1961 football season
against Tulane tomorrow in the
Stadium. Game time is 1:30 p.m.
Stanford will depend heavily on
sophomores most of whom were
still in high school when the In
dians scored their last victory — a
39-22 drubbing of Oregon State on
November 14, 1959. The squad in
cludes 33 who will be donning var
sity jerseys for the first time.
Senior quarterback Rod Sears
has finally nailed down the start
ing field general spot with sopho
more Steve Thurlow backing him
up. Thurlow hurt his shoulder
earlier in the week, but will be
ready to go tomorrow. The In
dians are hurting here already
with Jim Smith out because of an
hyper-extension of the shoulder.
SEARS played in the shadow of
Dick Norman for two years and
finally has a chance to come into
his own. Though he completed
only 13 of 40 last year, Sears had
a good spring and has been on the
target in practice sessions this
year.
Thurlow is expected to see ex
tensive action and may even split
the time equally. Coach Jack Cur
tice was undecided on which of
the signal callers to start until
late yesterday. The 200-pound
soph led the Stanford frosh in to
tal offense and passing in 1960.
He completed 11 of 28 for 212
yards in the four Papoose games.
The remainder of the starting
lineup will be George Honore and
Steve Pursell at ends, C. B. Si
mons and Frank Atkinson,
tackles; Errol Scott and Tom
Walsh, guards; and Chris Cottle,
center. The backfield will consist
of Gary Sargeant and Gary Craig
at halfs and Hal Steuber at full.
SARGEANT AND CRAIG were
surprise choices over Larry Royse,
Danny Spence, and Mike Barnes.
Both lettered in 1960 but played
primarily on defense. These five
plus junior Stan Lindsk'og give
the Indians a faster but far green
er set of backs than last year.
In Steuber the Cards have a
hard-hitting fullback who aver
aged 4.65 yards per carry playing
behind Skip Face. He is also a
deadly blocker and the best line
backer on the squad.
Stanford’s front line will be con
siderably larger than last year
boasting an average w'eight of
219. Simons (229) and Atkinson
(23(1) give the Indians a formid
able combination at tackles. Si
mons, though never a first string
er, played more than any other
tackle last season. He’s big and
strong but lacks the consistency
of a really great lineman. He is
being pushed by Randy Vahan
who has that very thing that C. B.
lacks. A junior, Vahan has im
proved considerably over last
year and will see plenty of action
tomorrow.
ATKINSON HAS never played
in a varsity ball game but shows
great promise and needs only ex
perience to develop into an out
standing tackle. The burly soph
managed to beat out two-year let
terman Jack Gordon, a top defens
ive player but lacking in size.
In Walsh and Scott the Indians
will have an experienced set of
guards who will have to hold the
line together if the Tulane run
ning game is to be stopped. Walsh,
a two-year lei terman, hasn’t
missed a game in two years and
figures to play havoc with Tulane
ball carriers.
Scott is also a two-year letter
man but injuries kept him out of
six games last season. The 5-10
218-pounder was shifted from left
guard this fall. Several fine pros
pects will play behind these two,
namely sophomores Mike Dow
ling, Frank Dubofsky, Marv Mar
ias and Wayne Pavilic, and junior
Starr Rounds.
AT END THERE will be a vast
improvement with letterman Hon
ore and Pursell combining experi
ence and sticky fingers all of
which may make for a good pass
ing attack. Behind these two are
senior Chet Hinshaw, and sopho
moies Bob Burke, Chris lessen,
Chuck McCormick, and Frank
Patitucci.
Center may well be the strong
est spot in the Card line with Cat
tle and Mike Butler, both two
year lettermen. Cottle has played
in every game for the last two
years while Butler has been lim
ited primarily to defense.
With 20 returning lettermen and
five first stringers returning Tu
lane seems to stand as a formid
able obstacle to that long-awaited
win. The Green Wave has lost All
American Tommy Mason and
their outstanding passer Phil Nu
gent to graduation and the pro
draft.
CORDON RUSH, a 203-pound

junior is expected to pick up the
slack and provide the offensive
punch needed in the Tulane back
field. Rush was switched from
fullback where he gained 182
yards in 42 carries last year.
The remainder of the Tulane
lineup includes Bill Roach and Joe
Lasseigne at ends, Ed Reynolds
and Ernie Colquette, tackles;
Glenn Holcombe and Gus Gon
zales, guards; Gohn Chaisson, cen
ter; Adrian Colon, right half; Ted
Miller, quarterback; and Lenny
Stein, full.

CORDON RUSH, a 203-pound

junior is expected to pick up the

Offensive and defensive stalwart gets call
Shooting for their first win in
two years, the Stanford Indians
open the 1961 football season
against Tulane tomorrow in the
Stadium. Game time is 1:30 p.m.
Stanford will depend heavily on
sophomores most of whom were
still in high school when the In
dians scored their last victory — a
39-22 drubbing of Oregon State on
November 14, 1959. The squad in
cludes 33 who will be donning var
sity jerseys for the first time.
Senior quarterback Rod Sears
has finally nailed down the start
ing field general spot with sopho
more Steve Thurlow backing him
up. Thurlow hurt his shoulder
earlier in the week, but will be
ready to go tomorrow. The In
dians are hurting here already
with Jim Smith out because of an
hyper-extension of the shoulder.
SEARS played in the shadow of
Dick Norman for two years and
finally has a chance to come into
his own. Though he completed
only 13 of 40 last year, Sears had
a good spring and has been on the
target in practice sessions this
year.
Thurlow is expected to see ex
tensive action and may even split
the time equally. Coach Jack Cur
tice was undecided on which of
the signal callers to start until
late yesterday. The 200-pound
soph led the Stanford frosh in to
tal offense and passing in 1960.
He completed 11 of 28 for 212
yards in the four Papoose games.
The remainder of the starting
lineup will be George Honore and
Steve Pursell at ends, C. B. Si
mons and Frank Atkinson,
tackles; Errol Scott and Tom
Walsh, guards; and Chris Cottle,
center. The backfield will consist
of Gary Sargeant and Gary Craig
at halfs and Hal Steuber at full.
SARGEANT AND CRAIG were
surprise choices over Larry Royse,
Danny Spence, and Mike Barnes.
Both lettered in 1960 but played
primarily on defense. These five
plus junior Stan Lindsk'og give
the Indians a faster but far green
er set of backs than last year.
In Steuber the Cards have a
hard-hitting fullback who aver
aged 4.65 yards per carry playing
behind Skip Face. He is also a
deadly blocker and the best line
backer on the squad.
Stanford’s front line will be con
siderably larger than last year
boasting an average w'eight of
219. Simons (229) and Atkinson
(23(1) give the Indians a formid
able combination at tackles. Si
mons, though never a first string
er, played more than any other
tackle last season. He’s big and
strong but lacks the consistency
of a really great lineman. He is
being pushed by Randy Vahan
who has that very thing that C. B.
lacks. A junior, Vahan has im
proved considerably over last
year and will see plenty of action
tomorrow.
ATKINSON HAS never played
in a varsity ball game but shows
great promise and needs only ex
perience to develop into an out
standing tackle. The burly soph
managed to beat out two-year let
terman Jack Gordon, a top defens
ive player but lacking in size.
In Walsh and Scott the Indians
will have an experienced set of
guards who will have to hold the
line together if the Tulane run
ning game is to be stopped. Walsh,
a two-year lei terman, hasn’t
missed a game in two years and
figures to play havoc with Tulane
ball carriers.
Scott is also a two-year letter
man but injuries kept him out of
six games last season. The 5-10
218-pounder was shifted from left
guard this fall. Several fine pros
pects will play behind these two,
namely sophomores Mike Dow
ling, Frank Dubofsky, Marv Mar
ias and Wayne Pavilic, and junior
Starr Rounds.
AT END THERE will be a vast
improvement with letterman Hon
ore and Pursell combining experi

mons, though never a first string
er, played more than any other
tackle last season. He’s big and
strong but lacks the consistency
of a really great lineman. He is
being pushed by Randy Vahan
who has that very thing that C. B.
lacks. A junior, Vahan has im
proved considerably over last
year and will see plenty of action
tomorrow.
ATKINSON HAS never played
in a varsity ball game but shows
great promise and needs only ex
perience to develop into an out
standing tackle. The burly soph
managed to beat out two-year let
terman Jack Gordon, a top defens
ive player but lacking in size.
In Walsh and Scott the Indians
will have an experienced set of
guards who will have to hold the
line together if the Tulane run
ning game is to be stopped. Walsh,
a two-year lei terman, hasn’t
missed a game in two years and
figures to play havoc with Tulane
ball carriers.
Scott is also a two-year letter
man but injuries kept him out of
six games last season. The 5-10
218-pounder was shifted from left
guard this fall. Several fine pros
pects will play behind these two,
namely sophomores Mike Dow
ling, Frank Dubofsky, Marv Mar
ias and Wayne Pavilic, and junior
Starr Rounds.
AT END THERE will be a vast
improvement with letterman Hon
ore and Pursell combining experi
ence and sticky fingers all of
which may make for a good pass
ing attack. Behind these two are
senior Chet Hinshaw, and sopho
moies Bob Burke, Chris lessen,
Chuck McCormick, and Frank
Patitucci.
Center may well be the strong
est spot in the Card line with Cat
tle and Mike Butler, both two
year lettermen. Cottle has played
in every game for the last two
years while Butler has been lim
ited primarily to defense.
With 20 returning lettermen and
five first stringers returning Tu
lane seems to stand as a formid
able obstacle to that long-awaited
win. The Green Wave has lost All
American Tommy Mason and
their outstanding passer Phil Nu
gent to graduation and the pro
draft.
CORDON RUSH, a 203-pound

junior is expected to pick up the
slack and provide the offensive
punch needed in the Tulane back
field. Rush was switched from
fullback where he gained 182
yards in 42 carries last year.
The remainder of the Tulane
lineup includes Bill Roach and Joe
Lasseigne at ends, Ed Reynolds
and Ernie Colquette, tackles;
Glenn Holcombe and Gus Gon
zales, guards; Gohn Chaisson, cen
ter; Adrian Colon, right half; Ted
Miller, quarterback; and Lenny

Offensive and defensive stalwart gets call
Shooting for their first win in
two years, the Stanford Indians
open the 1961 football season
against Tulane tomorrow in the
Stadium. Game time is 1:30 p.m.
Stanford will depend heavily on
sophomores most of whom were
still in high school when the In
dians scored their last victory — a
39-22 drubbing of Oregon State on
November 14, 1959. The squad in
cludes 33 who will be donning var
sity jerseys for the first time.
Senior quarterback Rod Sears
has finally nailed down the start
ing field general spot with sopho
more Steve Thurlow backing him
up. Thurlow hurt his shoulder
earlier in the week, but will be
ready to go tomorrow. The In
dians are hurting here already
with Jim Smith out because of an
hyper-extension of the shoulder.
SEARS played in the shadow of
Dick Norman for two years and
finally has a chance to come into
his own. Though he completed
only 13 of 40 last year, Sears had
a good spring and has been on the
target in practice sessions this
year.
Thurlow is expected to see ex
tensive action and may even split
the time equally. Coach Jack Cur
tice was undecided on which of
the signal callers to start until
late yesterday. The 200-pound
soph led the Stanford frosh in to
tal offense and passing in 1960.
He completed 11 of 28 for 212
yards in the four Papoose games.
The remainder of the starting
lineup will be George Honore and
Steve Pursell at ends, C. B. Si
mons and Frank Atkinson,
tackles; Errol Scott and Tom
Walsh, guards; and Chris Cottle,
center. The backfield will consist
of Gary Sargeant and Gary Craig
at halfs and Hal Steuber at full.
SARGEANT AND CRAIG were
surprise choices over Larry Royse,
Danny Spence, and Mike Barnes.
Both lettered in 1960 but played
primarily on defense. These five
plus junior Stan Lindsk'og give
the Indians a faster but far green
er set of backs than last year.
In Steuber the Cards have a
hard-hitting fullback who aver
aged 4.65 yards per carry playing
behind Skip Face. He is also a
deadly blocker and the best line
backer on the squad.
Stanford’s front line will be con
siderably larger than last year
boasting an average w'eight of
219. Simons (229) and Atkinson
(23(1) give the Indians a formid
able combination at tackles. Si
