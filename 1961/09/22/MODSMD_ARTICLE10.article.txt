# Cards Open Grid Slate Vs. Tulane
## 
### 
Shooting for their first win in
two years, the Stanford Indians
open the 1961 football season
against Tulane tomorrow in the
Stadium. Game time is 1:30 p.m.
Stanford will depend heavily on
sophomores most of whom were
still in high school when the In
dians scored their last victory — a
39-22 drubbing of Oregon State on
November 14, 1959. The squad in
cludes 33 who will be donning var
sity jerseys for the first time.
Senior quarterback Rod Sears
has finally nailed down the start
ing field general spot with sopho
more Steve Thurlow backing him
up. Thurlow hurt his shoulder
earlier in the week, but will be
ready to go tomorrow. The In
dians are hurting here already
with Jim Smith out because of an
hyper-extension of the shoulder.
SEARS played in the shadow of
Dick Norman for two years and
finally has a chance to come into
his own. Though he completed
only 13 of 40 last year, Sears had
a good spring and has been on the
target in practice sessions this
year.
Thurlow is expected to see ex
tensive action and may even split
the time equally. Coach Jack Cur
tice was undecided on which of
the signal callers to start until
late yesterday. The 200-pound
soph led the Stanford frosh in to
tal offense and passing in 1960.
He completed 11 of 28 for 212
yards in the four Papoose games.
The remainder of the starting
lineup will be George Honore and
Steve Pursell at ends, C. B. Si
mons and Frank Atkinson,
tackles; Errol Scott and Tom
Walsh, guards; and Chris Cottle,
center. The backfield will consist
of Gary Sargeant and Gary Craig
at halfs and Hal Steuber at full.
SARGEANT AND CRAIG were
surprise choices over Larry Royse,
Danny Spence, and Mike Barnes.
Both lettered in 1960 but played
primarily on defense. These five
plus junior Stan Lindsk'og give
the Indians a faster but far green
er set of backs than last year.
In Steuber the Cards have a
hard-hitting fullback who aver
aged 4.65 yards per carry playing
behind Skip Face. He is also a
