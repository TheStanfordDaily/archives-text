# Different Advice
## 
### 
Advice is something a freshman is never short of. And, as Dr.
Sterling pointed out in his Convocation speech, most of it is offered
by experienced persons who have been greeting freshmen for many
eears and have a solid background from which to speak.
Students don t have that experience to back up their advice,
but we still can point out some of the things we have found con
tribute to a worthwhile, full four years at Stanford. We don’t think
you will find all of them in University publications.
First, of course, we assume that the freshman realizes he is here
to obtain an education—not just to study, for studying does not
guarantee an education. As we say, a student must obtain an edu
cation; it will not be given to him, it can’t be gained by walking
around Quad and sitting in classrooms for four years. We have to
earn an education.
To our mind, the true student is the person who doesn’t passively
accept what he is offered, but who is constantly alert for the learn
ing opportunity—and learning opportunities are present every wak
ing moment, in the classroom or out of it, with others or when alone.
And the truly dedicated student will do his utmost never to
pass up a chance to learn something new. He is the kind of human
who will drop in on one of the many small afternoon lectures simply
because the topic of the talk interests him.
lie is the type of student who doesn’t feel a need to date every
Friday and Saturday night, but takes pleasure in settling down with
a good book and some peace and quiet—and who feels he will bene
fit just as much from the book as from a date.
Yet our ideal student doesn’t curl up with a book for four years,
going from dorm to class to libe to dorm again every day—as some
unfortunates always do.
He realizes the Bay Area offers unusual opportunities for enjoy
ing—and at the same time learning about—life and college years a
uniejue chance to take advantage of them.
Before his four years on The Farm are up he will have visited
North Beach countless times, always finding something different
and interesting with each trip. He will have played the role of the
“rich Stanford man” on a few occasions and taken the “rich Stan
ford woman” for a wallet-busting swing through “The City.”
A person who wants to get the most out of his four Stanford
years will make sure he picnicks in Golden Gate Park, visits Hayden
Planetarium, hears the San Francisco Symphony, and watches the
Giants at Candlestick Park.
He will succumb to the lure of a sunny fall or spring day and
cut his classes for a day at the beach—and come back a more relaxed
student.
In other words, the Stanford student who wants to derive as
much education and enjoyment as possible from his or her stay on
The Farm will seize every education opportunity which comes his
way—wherever it is, however he encounters it.

North Beach countless times, always finding something different
and interesting with each trip. He will have played the role of the
“rich Stanford man” on a few occasions and taken the “rich Stan

A person who wants to get the most out of his four Stanford
years will make sure he picnicks in Golden Gate Park, visits Hayden
Planetarium, hears the San Francisco Symphony, and watches the
Giants at Candlestick Park.
He will succumb to the lure of a sunny fall or spring day and
cut his classes for a day at the beach—and come back a more relaxed

In other words, the Stanford student who wants to derive as
much education and enjoyment as possible from his or her stay on
The Farm will seize every education opportunity which comes his
way—wherever it is, however he encounters it.
Advice is something a freshman is never short of. And, as Dr.

around Quad and sitting in classrooms for four years. We have to
earn an education.
To our mind, the true student is the person who doesn’t passively
accept what he is offered, but who is constantly alert for the learn
ing opportunity—and learning opportunities are present every wak
ing moment, in the classroom or out of it, with others or when alone.
And the truly dedicated student will do his utmost never to
pass up a chance to learn something new. He is the kind of human
who will drop in on one of the many small afternoon lectures simply
because the topic of the talk interests him.
lie is the type of student who doesn’t feel a need to date every
Friday and Saturday night, but takes pleasure in settling down with
a good book and some peace and quiet—and who feels he will bene
fit just as much from the book as from a date.
Yet our ideal student doesn’t curl up with a book for four years,
going from dorm to class to libe to dorm again every day—as some
unfortunates always do.
