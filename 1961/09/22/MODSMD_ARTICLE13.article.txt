Walker’s request was relayed to
Chairman Richard B. Russell, D-
Ga., by Sen. John G. Tower, R-
Tex, Tower said he was under the
impression that Russell would let
the general testify.
TOWER said he submitted
Walker’s request after Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara
assured him the general was “not
under wraps.” Tower said Mc-
Namara told him in response to a
telegram that Walker was free to
tell his side of his army repri
mand.
Walker was removed from com
mand of the 24th Division in Gor
in an y and reprimanded on
grounds that he tried to influence
servicemen’s votes in the 1960
election.

gation said Walker was a member
of the John Birch Society. The
general was expected to return to
the United States this week.
Walker asked to testify in the
Senate inquiry as Russell named
the investigating subcommittee,
headed by Sen. John C. Stennis,
D-Miss. Stennis, a former judge,
served on the committee set up
in 1954 to hoar censure charges
against the late Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy, R-Wis.

S.C.. who made the muzzling
charges and demanded the inves
tigation, and Sen. E. L. Bartlett,
D-Alaska, the only Armed Serv
ices Committee member who op
posed the study.

mittee are Sens. Stuart Syming
ton, D-Mo.; Henry M. Jackson, D-
