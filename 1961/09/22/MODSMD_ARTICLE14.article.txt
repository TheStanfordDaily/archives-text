## W. German Government Faces New Decisions 
### 
It has been evident all summer
that after the Gorman elections,
which took place on Sunday, the
Bonn government would have to
make some very difficult deci
sions.

They arise from the fact that
since the foundation of the Feder
al Republic with Dr. Adenauer as
Chancellor, Western and West
German policy has rested on two
incompatible promises.
One has been that West Ger
many would become integrated in
NATO and the Common Market
and even in the political institu
tions of Western Europe. The
other promise has been that West
Germany can absorb and reunite
with East Germany.
IT HAS been known for some
years that both promises could
not be fulfilled now or in any fore
seeable future. None know this
better than the leaders of the
French government.
It has been assumed in London,
it has been reluctantly taken for
granted in Bonn, and among seri
ous students of the German prob
lem in America it has long been
accepted as a fact.
But it would have been political
poison in West Germany for the
Allies to speak out loud about this
choice between joining Western
Europe and rejoining East Ger
many.
IN ORDER to avoid any taint
of interference in German domes
tic politics, there has been no
serious open discussion of the
German question during this past
summer.
Incredible as it will seem to the
historian, we have teetered on the
brink of nuclear war without one
paragraph, without one sentence,
from any Allied leader seriously
discussing the German problem.
Yet a choice between the two
Adenauer promises is now un
avoidable and all the responsible
and informed Germans know it
quite well. No one at this distance
can say how large a part was
played in the elections by the re
alization that new decisions of
policy would become necessary,
and that they should be made by
younger men than Dr. Adenauer.
BUT IF, as the returns indi
cate, the outcome makes neces
sary a coalition government, the
German voters will have done
well. The decisions which the next
government must take should rest
on broad national support, and no
party should be in a position to
exploit the disappointment caused
by the break-up of the old wishful
stereotypes and slogans.
The new decisions are unavoid
able and they are most necessary
because the physical partition of
Germany has become a fully ac
complished fact and this fact has
been acquiesced in by the whole
NATO alliance.
There is no use saying that in
acquiescing the West has surren
dered to Khrushchev.
FOR THIS overlooks the essen
tial explanation for European ac
quiescence in the partition. The
fact is that for ten years or more
the Western powers have built
their whole German policy on the
partition of Germany. NATO is
based on the partition of Ger
many. The Common Market is
based on the partition of Ger
many.
The embarrassment in the West
today, particularly in Paris and
in Washington, does not arise
from the fact that Germany is
now fully partitioned. The embar
rassment arises from being asked
to recognize the fact of partition
which has so long been hidden
and. although all Western Europe
believes in it, has never been
avowed.
The decision which the West
Germans face is whether they
will commit themselves wholly
and wholeheartedly to the West
to NATO, the Common Market,
the United Nations, and to the
web of political and cultural as
sociations which constitute West
ern society.
OR whether they will remain
with the West, but remain with
mental reservations, as for ex
ample that they might purchase
reunification from the Soviets.
We shall need some assurances
from Bonn.
For there are already voices
saying that we have betrayed
them, that if we call a spade a
spade, we will have surrendered.
I do not myself believe that the
Germans can or should renounce
re-unification. But they will have
to wait a long time for it and a
lot will have to be done first in
order to make it possible in the
end.

N.OW, in the emotional crisis
which arises out of dire realiza
tion that partition has come, the
mission of the West Germans is
to use their great gifts and their
great power to make work and to
build up non-Communist Europe
and the Atlantic Community.
That is the only present answer
to Khrushchevâ€™s action of August
13 which sealed the partition of
Germany, and indeed the partition
of Europe: create in the West a
great, powerful, rich, and free
community which must be reck
oned with in all the calculations
of world power.
When the Germans make up

their minds to recognize the fact
of partition, the effect in Poland

and elsewhere in Eastern Europe
will be far-reaching. The fear of
a revived and re-armed Germany
seeking its lost territories is, next
to the Red Army, (he most power
ful fact which binds the satellite
empire to Moscow.
REMOVE or even reduce that
fear, and the tension in Eastern
Europe will decline. There is little

doubt that then the spirit of in
dependence will arise. For it rises
and falls inversely with the fear
of German revival and of world
war.
If the Germans, having recog
nized the fact of partition, change
their present policy and seek bet
ter relations in Eastern Europe,
they will do a great service to the

world.
For the day would then not be
too far off when the Eastern Eu
ropean countries, like Finland to
day, would begin to draw closer
to the world economy.
If it becomes possible to nego
tiate a wide central European ar
rangement with Khrushchev, it
should open the door to a gradu-

ally closer association of the two
German states.
Under present circumstances
they cannot be fused into one
state. But they might look for
ward to becoming some day a
Dual State, not unlike the Austro-
Hungarian monarchy before the
first World War.
The question is often asked
these days: what is there to nego
tiate with Khrushchev?
THE ANSWER, 1 would say, is
that we can and should negotiate
the following: A reaffirmation of
the access between West Berlin
and the outer world. A reaffirma
tion of the right of West Berlin to
political, economic, and cultural
self-determination. The future
place of West Berlin while Ger
many remains divided, perhaps as
an international city which would
become the seat of the European
section of the United Nations. An
agreement for the elimination of
nuclear weapons and elminalion
of conventional weapons in some
considerable area of Central Eu
rope.

If it becomes possible to nego
tiate a wide central European ar
rangement with Khrushchev, it
should open the door to a gradu-

ally closer association of the two
German states.
Under present circumstances
they cannot be fused into one
state. But they might look for
ward to becoming some day a
Dual State, not unlike the Austro-
Hungarian monarchy before the
first World War.
The question is often asked
these days: what is there to nego
tiate with Khrushchev?
THE ANSWER, 1 would say, is
that we can and should negotiate
the following: A reaffirmation of
the access between West Berlin
and the outer world. A reaffirma
tion of the right of West Berlin to
political, economic, and cultural
self-determination. The future
place of West Berlin while Ger
many remains divided, perhaps as
an international city which would
become the seat of the European
section of the United Nations. An
agreement for the elimination of
nuclear weapons and elminalion
of conventional weapons in some
considerable area of Central Eu
rope.

It has been evident all summer
that after the Gorman elections,
which took place on Sunday, the
Bonn government would have to
make some very difficult deci
sions.

They arise from the fact that
since the foundation of the Feder
al Republic with Dr. Adenauer as
Chancellor, Western and West
German policy has rested on two
incompatible promises.
One has been that West Ger
many would become integrated in
NATO and the Common Market
and even in the political institu
tions of Western Europe. The
other promise has been that West
Germany can absorb and reunite
with East Germany.
IT HAS been known for some
years that both promises could
not be fulfilled now or in any fore
seeable future. None know this
better than the leaders of the
French government.
It has been assumed in London,
it has been reluctantly taken for
granted in Bonn, and among seri
ous students of the German prob
lem in America it has long been
accepted as a fact.
But it would have been political
poison in West Germany for the
Allies to speak out loud about this
choice between joining Western
Europe and rejoining East Ger
many.
IN ORDER to avoid any taint
of interference in German domes
tic politics, there has been no
serious open discussion of the
German question during this past
summer.
Incredible as it will seem to the
historian, we have teetered on the
brink of nuclear war without one
paragraph, without one sentence,
from any Allied leader seriously
discussing the German problem.
Yet a choice between the two
Adenauer promises is now un
avoidable and all the responsible
and informed Germans know it
quite well. No one at this distance
can say how large a part was
played in the elections by the re
alization that new decisions of
policy would become necessary,
and that they should be made by
younger men than Dr. Adenauer.
BUT IF, as the returns indi
cate, the outcome makes neces
sary a coalition government, the
German voters will have done
well. The decisions which the next
government must take should rest
on broad national support, and no
party should be in a position to
exploit the disappointment caused
by the break-up of the old wishful
stereotypes and slogans.
The new decisions are unavoid
able and they are most necessary
because the physical partition of
Germany has become a fully ac
complished fact and this fact has
been acquiesced in by the whole
NATO alliance.
There is no use saying that in
acquiescing the West has surren
dered to Khrushchev.
FOR THIS overlooks the essen
tial explanation for European ac
quiescence in the partition. The
fact is that for ten years or more
the Western powers have built
their whole German policy on the
partition of Germany. NATO is
based on the partition of Ger
many. The Common Market is
based on the partition of Ger
many.
The embarrassment in the West
today, particularly in Paris and
in Washington, does not arise
from the fact that Germany is
now fully partitioned. The embar
rassment arises from being asked
to recognize the fact of partition
which has so long been hidden
and. although all Western Europe
believes in it, has never been
avowed.
The decision which the West
Germans face is whether they
will commit themselves wholly
and wholeheartedly to the West
to NATO, the Common Market,
the United Nations, and to the
web of political and cultural as
sociations which constitute West
ern society.
OR whether they will remain
with the West, but remain with
mental reservations, as for ex
ample that they might purchase
reunification from the Soviets.
We shall need some assurances
from Bonn.
For there are already voices
saying that we have betrayed
them, that if we call a spade a
spade, we will have surrendered.
I do not myself believe that the
Germans can or should renounce
re-unification. But they will have
to wait a long time for it and a
lot will have to be done first in
order to make it possible in the
end.

N.OW, in the emotional crisis
which arises out of dire realiza
tion that partition has come, the
mission of the West Germans is
to use their great gifts and their
great power to make work and to
build up non-Communist Europe
and the Atlantic Community.
That is the only present answer
to Khrushchevâ€™s action of August
13 which sealed the partition of
Germany, and indeed the partition
of Europe: create in the West a
great, powerful, rich, and free
community which must be reck
oned with in all the calculations
of world power.
When the Germans make up

their minds to recognize the fact
of partition, the effect in Poland

and elsewhere in Eastern Europe
will be far-reaching. The fear of
a revived and re-armed Germany
seeking its lost territories is, next
to the Red Army, (he most power
ful fact which binds the satellite
empire to Moscow.
REMOVE or even reduce that
fear, and the tension in Eastern
Europe will decline. There is little

doubt that then the spirit of in
dependence will arise. For it rises
and falls inversely with the fear
of German revival and of world
war.
If the Germans, having recog
nized the fact of partition, change
their present policy and seek bet
ter relations in Eastern Europe,
they will do a great service to the

world.
For the day would then not be
too far off when the Eastern Eu
ropean countries, like Finland to
day, would begin to draw closer
to the world economy.
If it becomes possible to nego
tiate a wide central European ar
rangement with Khrushchev, it
should open the door to a gradu-

ally closer association of the two
German states.

of Europe: create in the West a
great, powerful, rich, and free
community which must be reck

of world power.
When the Germans make up

their minds to recognize the fact
of partition, the effect in Poland

and elsewhere in Eastern Europe
will be far-reaching. The fear of
a revived and re-armed Germany
seeking its lost territories is, next
to the Red Army, (he most power
ful fact which binds the satellite
empire to Moscow.
REMOVE or even reduce that
fear, and the tension in Eastern
Europe will decline. There is little

doubt that then the spirit of in

and falls inversely with the fear
of German revival and of world
war.
If the Germans, having recog
nized the fact of partition, change
their present policy and seek bet
ter relations in Eastern Europe,
they will do a great service to the

world.
For the day would then not be

If it becomes possible to nego

Under present circumstances
they cannot be fused into one

Dual State, not unlike the Austro-

The question is often asked
these days: what is there to nego

THE ANSWER, 1 would say, is
that we can and should negotiate
the following: A reaffirmation of
the access between West Berlin
and the outer world. A reaffirma
tion of the right of West Berlin to
political, economic, and cultural
self-determination. The future
place of West Berlin while Ger
many remains divided, perhaps as
an international city which would
become the seat of the European
section of the United Nations. An
agreement for the elimination of
nuclear weapons and elminalion
of conventional weapons in some
considerable area of Central Eu
rope.

It has been evident all summer
that after the Gorman elections,
which took place on Sunday, the
Bonn government would have to
make some very difficult deci
sions.

They arise from the fact that
since the foundation of the Feder
al Republic with Dr. Adenauer as
Chancellor, Western and West
German policy has rested on two
incompatible promises.
One has been that West Ger
many would become integrated in
NATO and the Common Market
and even in the political institu
tions of Western Europe. The
other promise has been that West
Germany can absorb and reunite
with East Germany.
IT HAS been known for some
years that both promises could
not be fulfilled now or in any fore
seeable future. None know this
better than the leaders of the
French government.
It has been assumed in London,
it has been reluctantly taken for
granted in Bonn, and among seri
ous students of the German prob
lem in America it has long been
accepted as a fact.
But it would have been political
poison in West Germany for the
Allies to speak out loud about this
choice between joining Western
Europe and rejoining East Ger
many.
IN ORDER to avoid any taint
of interference in German domes
tic politics, there has been no
serious open discussion of the
German question during this past
summer.
Incredible as it will seem to the
historian, we have teetered on the
brink of nuclear war without one
paragraph, without one sentence,
from any Allied leader seriously
discussing the German problem.
Yet a choice between the two
Adenauer promises is now un
avoidable and all the responsible
and informed Germans know it
quite well. No one at this distance
can say how large a part was
played in the elections by the re
alization that new decisions of
policy would become necessary,
and that they should be made by
younger men than Dr. Adenauer.
BUT IF, as the returns indi
cate, the outcome makes neces
sary a coalition government, the
German voters will have done
well. The decisions which the next
government must take should rest
on broad national support, and no
party should be in a position to
exploit the disappointment caused
by the break-up of the old wishful
stereotypes and slogans.
The new decisions are unavoid
able and they are most necessary
because the physical partition of
Germany has become a fully ac
complished fact and this fact has
been acquiesced in by the whole
NATO alliance.
There is no use saying that in
acquiescing the West has surren
dered to Khrushchev.
FOR THIS overlooks the essen
tial explanation for European ac
quiescence in the partition. The
fact is that for ten years or more
the Western powers have built
their whole German policy on the
partition of Germany. NATO is
based on the partition of Ger
many. The Common Market is
based on the partition of Ger
many.
The embarrassment in the West
today, particularly in Paris and
in Washington, does not arise
from the fact that Germany is
now fully partitioned. The embar
rassment arises from being asked
to recognize the fact of partition
which has so long been hidden
and. although all Western Europe
believes in it, has never been
avowed.
The decision which the West
Germans face is whether they
will commit themselves wholly
and wholeheartedly to the West
to NATO, the Common Market,
the United Nations, and to the
web of political and cultural as
sociations which constitute West
ern society.
OR whether they will remain
with the West, but remain with
mental reservations, as for ex
ample that they might purchase
reunification from the Soviets.
We shall need some assurances
from Bonn.
For there are already voices
saying that we have betrayed
them, that if we call a spade a
spade, we will have surrendered.
I do not myself believe that the
Germans can or should renounce
re-unification. But they will have
to wait a long time for it and a
lot will have to be done first in
order to make it possible in the
end.

N.OW, in the emotional crisis
which arises out of dire realiza
tion that partition has come, the
mission of the West Germans is
to use their great gifts and their
great power to make work and to
build up non-Communist Europe
and the Atlantic Community.
That is the only present answer
to Khrushchevâ€™s action of August
13 which sealed the partition of
Germany, and indeed the partition
of Europe: create in the West a
great, powerful, rich, and free
community which must be reck
oned with in all the calculations

the United Nations, and to the
web of political and cultural as
sociations which constitute West
ern society.
OR whether they will remain
with the West, but remain with
mental reservations, as for ex
ample that they might purchase
reunification from the Soviets.
We shall need some assurances
from Bonn.
For there are already voices
saying that we have betrayed
them, that if we call a spade a
spade, we will have surrendered.
I do not myself believe that the
Germans can or should renounce
re-unification. But they will have
to wait a long time for it and a
lot will have to be done first in
order to make it possible in the
end.

N.OW, in the emotional crisis
which arises out of dire realiza
tion that partition has come, the
mission of the West Germans is
to use their great gifts and their
great power to make work and to
build up non-Communist Europe
and the Atlantic Community.
That is the only present answer
to Khrushchevâ€™s action of August
13 which sealed the partition of
Germany, and indeed the partition
of Europe: create in the West a
great, powerful, rich, and free
community which must be reck
oned with in all the calculations
of world power.
When the Germans make up

their minds to recognize the fact
of partition, the effect in Poland

and elsewhere in Eastern Europe
will be far-reaching. The fear of
a revived and re-armed Germany
seeking its lost territories is, next
to the Red Army, (he most power
ful fact which binds the satellite
empire to Moscow.
REMOVE or even reduce that
fear, and the tension in Eastern
Europe will decline. There is little

doubt that then the spirit of in
dependence will arise. For it rises
and falls inversely with the fear
of German revival and of world
war.
If the Germans, having recog
nized the fact of partition, change
their present policy and seek bet
ter relations in Eastern Europe,
they will do a great service to the

world.
For the day would then not be
too far off when the Eastern Eu
ropean countries, like Finland to
day, would begin to draw closer
to the world economy.
If it becomes possible to nego
tiate a wide central European ar
rangement with Khrushchev, it
should open the door to a gradu-

ally closer association of the two
German states.
Under present circumstances
they cannot be fused into one
state. But they might look for
ward to becoming some day a
Dual State, not unlike the Austro-
Hungarian monarchy before the
first World War.
The question is often asked
these days: what is there to nego
tiate with Khrushchev?
THE ANSWER, 1 would say, is
that we can and should negotiate
the following: A reaffirmation of
the access between West Berlin
and the outer world. A reaffirma
tion of the right of West Berlin to
political, economic, and cultural
self-determination. The future
place of West Berlin while Ger
many remains divided, perhaps as
an international city which would
become the seat of the European
section of the United Nations. An
agreement for the elimination of
nuclear weapons and elminalion
of conventional weapons in some
considerable area of Central Eu
rope.

It has been evident all summer
that after the Gorman elections,
which took place on Sunday, the
Bonn government would have to
make some very difficult deci
sions.

They arise from the fact that
since the foundation of the Feder
al Republic with Dr. Adenauer as
Chancellor, Western and West
German policy has rested on two
incompatible promises.
One has been that West Ger
many would become integrated in
NATO and the Common Market
and even in the political institu
tions of Western Europe. The
other promise has been that West
Germany can absorb and reunite
with East Germany.
IT HAS been known for some
years that both promises could
not be fulfilled now or in any fore
seeable future. None know this
better than the leaders of the
French government.
It has been assumed in London,
it has been reluctantly taken for
granted in Bonn, and among seri
ous students of the German prob
lem in America it has long been
accepted as a fact.
But it would have been political
poison in West Germany for the
Allies to speak out loud about this
choice between joining Western
Europe and rejoining East Ger
many.
IN ORDER to avoid any taint
of interference in German domes
tic politics, there has been no
serious open discussion of the
German question during this past
summer.
Incredible as it will seem to the
historian, we have teetered on the
brink of nuclear war without one
paragraph, without one sentence,
from any Allied leader seriously
discussing the German problem.
Yet a choice between the two
Adenauer promises is now un
avoidable and all the responsible
and informed Germans know it
quite well. No one at this distance
can say how large a part was
played in the elections by the re
alization that new decisions of
policy would become necessary,
and that they should be made by
younger men than Dr. Adenauer.
BUT IF, as the returns indi
cate, the outcome makes neces
sary a coalition government, the
German voters will have done
well. The decisions which the next
government must take should rest
on broad national support, and no
party should be in a position to
exploit the disappointment caused
by the break-up of the old wishful
stereotypes and slogans.
The new decisions are unavoid
able and they are most necessary
because the physical partition of
Germany has become a fully ac
complished fact and this fact has
been acquiesced in by the whole
NATO alliance.
There is no use saying that in
acquiescing the West has surren
dered to Khrushchev.
FOR THIS overlooks the essen
tial explanation for European ac
quiescence in the partition. The
fact is that for ten years or more
the Western powers have built
their whole German policy on the
partition of Germany. NATO is
based on the partition of Ger
many. The Common Market is
based on the partition of Ger
many.
The embarrassment in the West
today, particularly in Paris and
in Washington, does not arise
from the fact that Germany is
now fully partitioned. The embar
rassment arises from being asked
to recognize the fact of partition
which has so long been hidden
and. although all Western Europe
believes in it, has never been
avowed.
The decision which the West
Germans face is whether they
will commit themselves wholly
and wholeheartedly to the West
to NATO, the Common Market,
the United Nations, and to the
web of political and cultural as
sociations which constitute West
ern society.
OR whether they will remain
with the West, but remain with
mental reservations, as for ex
ample that they might purchase
reunification from the Soviets.
We shall need some assurances
from Bonn.
For there are already voices
saying that we have betrayed
them, that if we call a spade a
