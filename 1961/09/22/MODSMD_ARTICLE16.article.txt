# Clinical Radiotherapy Cancer Research Center To Be Established at Stanford Medical School
## 
### 
A Clinical Radiotherapy Cancer
Research Center will be establish
ed at the Stanford Medical Center
this fall under a $943,412 grant
from the National Cancer Insti
tute.
Very few patients will be hos
pitalized under the center’s aus
pices until after Jan. 1, but eventu
ally 15 beds will be occupied by
research patients. Between 200
and 500 patients a year will be
cared for under the program.
The new center is one of eight
cancer research units now being
set up by the NCI in medical in
stitutions across the country.
INVESTIGATORS in several
disciplines will join with the Stan
ford School of Medicine’s Depart
ment of Radiology in the research.
Major research areas will include:
• Studies of the value of chemi
cals which enhance the effect of
radiation for treatment of tumors.
• Experiments with methods of
altering the amount of oxygen
reaching tissue for the purpose of
changing radiation sensitivity.
• Studies of tumor blood sup
ply. which might lead to methods
of selectively making some tu

mors more sensitive to X-rays.
• Exploration of methods of
using radio-opaque agents to re
veal early tumors of the lymphat
ic system, which is very suscepti
ble to the spread of cancer from
other sites.
• Studies of skin ailments and
gynecologic tumors which relate
to these problems and techniques.
THE PROGRAM director for
the Cancer Research Center is
Prof. Henry S. Kaplan, executive
of the Department of Radiology.
Assistant Prof. Malcolm A. Bag
shaw, director of the radiotherapy
division of the department, will be
deputy director.
Now equipment needed in the
Medical Center to support the re
search will include a second six
million-electron-volt medical lin
ear accelerator, to be Installed
near (he present unit; a new X-ray
lab for tumor diagnosis; and more
facilities for the isotope labora
tory.

In addition to supporting the re
search through August of 1962,
the NCI had indicated that there
will be funds allocated for six suc
ceeding years.
