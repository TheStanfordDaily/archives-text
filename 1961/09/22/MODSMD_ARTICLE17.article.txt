# SOCIAL CRITICISM IMPORTANT
## Rhinelander Lists University Goals 
### JUDY SHEAR Associate, Editor 
Philip H. Rhinelander, profes
sor of philosophy and former
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
yesterday told the freshman class
that the University must become
the keeper of the public con
science in order to attain a gen
uine kind of excellence.
In dealing with “The Problem
of Excellence,” Rhinelander said,
“the university should embody
and express the community’s best
ideas; it should remind the com
munity of its own ideas and aspir
ations.”
As part of an attempt to clarify
educational objectives, Rhinelan
der defined four major characters
of university excellence.
• In research.
• In public service by provid
ing experts with special knowl
edge for advice and consultation,
• In social criticism by reflect
ing the best aims of the society
in which it exists.
• In education by equiping its
students to advance the best
ideals of a free society.
A liberal education, which is
concerned with the individual
member of a free society without
regard for his profession, aims
to develop the member’s intellec
tual and spiritual capacities.
The pursuit of genuine excel
lence—as distinguished from me
retricious excellence—requires a
philosophy and a program of ob
jectives.
AN EDUCATION should teach
students to think critically, ana
lytically and with judgment and
therefore to determine and select
genuine excellence.
Education is direct expression
of an active awareness of a stand
ard, he stressed. He quoted Herb
ert Hoover as saying that the uni
versity must reflect the standard
of the uncommon man.
Rhinelander drew a distinction
between education in a free and
in a communist society.
“You are not here to be indoc
trinated or passive,” he told the
freshmen. “Nor are you here to
learn only useful skills.”
THE PRIMARY responsibility
lies with the student, he stressed.
He noted that a communist so

ciety can give an excellent tech
nical education, but that because
of the application of initiative ed
ucation in a free society reaches
far beyond both information and
technical skill.
A liberal education will pro
duce excellent members of a free
society, excellent human beings,
and finally, wisdom.
In dealing with the “The Price
of Excellence” Vice Provost Rob
ert J. Wert recalled William
James, who said that the wealth
of a nation is in the number of
its superior men.
He noted that n today’s world
goals cannot be attained by at
tention to material things alone,
and that they will be gained by
the trained minds of superior
people. He intimated that the
freshmen are those people.
HE MENTIONED the impor
tance of contact of the academic
community with the world sur
rounding it.
He commented briefly on the
revised General Studies program
and the Overseas campuses,
which are movements forward.
Wert explored the role that
PACE will play in the next 10
years with improvements in fac
ulty, student and plant areas.

In dealing with the “The Price
of Excellence” Vice Provost Rob
ert J. Wert recalled William
James, who said that the wealth
of a nation is in the number of
its superior men.
He noted that n today’s world
goals cannot be attained by at
tention to material things alone,
and that they will be gained by
the trained minds of superior
people. He intimated that the
freshmen are those people.
HE MENTIONED the impor
tance of contact of the academic
community with the world sur
rounding it.
He commented briefly on the
revised General Studies program
and the Overseas campuses,
which are movements forward.
Wert explored the role that

Philip H. Rhinelander, profes
sor of philosophy and former
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
yesterday told the freshman class
that the University must become
the keeper of the public con
science in order to attain a gen
uine kind of excellence.
In dealing with “The Problem
of Excellence,” Rhinelander said,
“the university should embody
and express the community’s best
ideas; it should remind the com
munity of its own ideas and aspir
ations.”
As part of an attempt to clarify
educational objectives, Rhinelan
der defined four major characters
of university excellence.
• In research.
• In public service by provid
ing experts with special knowl
edge for advice and consultation,
• In social criticism by reflect
ing the best aims of the society
in which it exists.
• In education by equiping its
students to advance the best
ideals of a free society.
A liberal education, which is
concerned with the individual
member of a free society without
regard for his profession, aims
to develop the member’s intellec
tual and spiritual capacities.
The pursuit of genuine excel
lence—as distinguished from me
retricious excellence—requires a
philosophy and a program of ob
jectives.
AN EDUCATION should teach
students to think critically, ana
lytically and with judgment and
therefore to determine and select
genuine excellence.
Education is direct expression
of an active awareness of a stand
ard, he stressed. He quoted Herb
ert Hoover as saying that the uni
versity must reflect the standard
of the uncommon man.
Rhinelander drew a distinction
between education in a free and
in a communist society.
“You are not here to be indoc
trinated or passive,” he told the
freshmen. “Nor are you here to
learn only useful skills.”
THE PRIMARY responsibility
lies with the student, he stressed.
He noted that a communist so

ciety can give an excellent tech
nical education, but that because
of the application of initiative ed
ucation in a free society reaches
far beyond both information and
technical skill.
A liberal education will pro
duce excellent members of a free
society, excellent human beings,
and finally, wisdom.
