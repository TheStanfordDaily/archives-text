BERLIN (UPI) Retired Gen.
Lucius D. Clay yesterday demon
strated American firmness in Ber
lin by flying in a helicopter to the
American sector village of Stein
stuecken, isolated a mile deep in
the Soviet zone.
His helicopter was not chal
lenged but Communist police were
reported “nervous and astound
ed.” Villagers, once they had got
over their astonishment, clapped
and wept with joy and thrust arm
fuls of hastily-gathered flowers
into his hands.
CLAY ARRIVED in Steinstu
ecken unheralded after hearing re
ports the Communist police were
interfering with traffic to the vil
lage despite its legal attachment
to the American sector. Villagers
saw his flight as proof the United
States will not let even the slight
est of its rights go to the Com
munists by default.
Two middle aged women were
gathering crops when the helicop
ter’ appeared out of the sky. “Mein
Gott,” one shouted and then she
recognized Clay as the hero of the
Berlin airlift. She embraced him
with cries of “Thank God.”
. Residents scattered through the
streets seeking village mayor
Friedrich Reichow, 49. He was
found in a field and mounted his
bicycle and pedalled back to his
office to greet Clay.
THE TWO conferred on the
Stelnstuecken situation while
most of the enclave’s 48 families
watched approvingly. Clay then
dropped into the hamlet’s only
drugstore and toasted the propri
etor who produced a bottle of 1951
Moselle wine for the occasion.
