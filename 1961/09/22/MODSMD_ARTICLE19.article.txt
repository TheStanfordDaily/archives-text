# Adenauer Receives A Setback
## 
### 
BONN (UPl)—The Christian
Democratic Parliamentary Party
voted last night to open coalition
negotiations with the Free Demo
crats in an action that appeared
to indicate a further setback for
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.

The decision by the 39-member
Executive of the party came only
a few hours after 85-year-old Ade
nauer invited Socialist Party
Chairman Erich Ollenhauer to an
immediate meeting to discuss for
mation of a new government.
Adenauer’s courtship of the So
cialists apparently was designed
to frighten the Free Democrats,
who admittedly want to join the
Christian Democrats in a new
government, but set Adenauer’s
retirement as a condition of their
cooperation.
The situation was confused four
days after the Parliamentary elec
tion which cost the Christian Dem
ocrats their absolute majority but
still left them the largest party.
But the decision of the Christian
Democratic group to open negoti
ations with the Free Democrats
despite the demand of the latter
that Adenauer retire was seen as
a set-back for the Chancellor.
The Christian Democratic de
cision was a rumble indicating a
possible storm inside the party.
Defense Minister Franz Josef
Strauss, leader of the Christian
Socialist Union the Christian
Democratic Bavarian wing told
that group Wednesday he thought
the best solution would be for
Adenauer to remain Chancellor
for about another 12 months.
Adenauer then should make
room for Economics Minister Lud
wig Erhard, Strauss said. That
would give Erhard and his team
three years before the next elec
tion to establish themselves.
Erhard was reported trying to
force Adenauer to make a defi
nite statement on his retirement
plans, and to say now that he ac
cepts Erhard as his successor.
Adenauer, party sources said,
refused both demands. Specifical
ly, he told the Parliamentary
Party Executive today it would be
unconstitutional for him to prom
ise to limit his stay in office to
any period. Under the constitu
tion, a Chancellor may be re
moved only when more than one
half of the members of parliament
have agreed on a successor.
It may have been this state
ment that caused Strauss to tell
newsmen that Adenauer “is an
agile, tricky, tactically experi
enced and exceptionally young
man.”
