# PROMISES ACCESS TO 'FREE CITY'
## Gromyko Orders Allies Out; Threatens East Berlin Treaty 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI) Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko
at a lengthy cold war conference
yesterday with Secretary of State
Doan Rusk was reported to have
renewed in firm terms the Rus
sian demand that the Western al
lies pull out of Beilin and permit
it to become a demilitarized “free”
city.
Rusk and Gromyko, who met
four hours and 25 minutes in the
Secretary's Waldorf Towers suite,
wore understood to have spent vir
tually all their lime on the Berlin
and German problems. However,
Rusk did touch, it was said, on the
questions of the Congo, Laos, and
Soviet demands for a change in
the' structure of the United Na
tions.”
GROMYKO WAS said to have
indicated no “give” in the Soviet
position originally outlined by
Premier Nikita Khrushchev at his
June meeting with President Ken
nedy in Vienna.
The Soviet official went through
the entire range of Soviet de
mands, Concluding with Khrush
chev’s threat to sign a separate
peace treaty with Communist
Germany and isolate the Allies in
West Berlin if they fail to accept
hi-s “free” city deal.
But the tone of the talks, as dis
closed in an official American
statement, was “friendly and busi
ness-like.” Gromyko indulged in
no strong language nor was there
any table-thumping.
Rusk was reported to have

made it clear to Gromyko that the
United States believes Russia is
wasting its time trying to get the
United Nations to replace the Sec
retary-General with a throe-nation
committee subject to Communist
veto.
RUSK EXPLAINED to Gromy
ko that this would require a
change in the U.N. Charter by a
two-thirds majority vote and this

simply could not bo obtained no
matter how great the. Communist
pressure.
Rusk was understood to feel
that the first session went about
as he had expected and left him
neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
The Secretary was said to have
outlined firmly the U.S. position
on Berlin and Germany, empha
sizing in particular the fact that
it would not give up its vital in
terests. If was explained to Gro
myko that this meant the West
would fight to stay in Berlin with
free access to the city.
The luncheon began at 1 p.m.
EDT and the talk on the “Troika”,
Congo and Laos apparently took
place before the conferees rose
from the table at 2:30 p.m. and ad
journed to the sitting room. From
that time until the meeting ended
at 5:25 p.m. the talk was all about
Berlin and Germany.
The expectation was that the
second meeting between Rusk and
Gromyko, which will take place
next Tuesday or Wednesday at
Gromyko’s headquarters, will go
further toward disclosing whether
there is any basis for negotia
tion.

GROMYKO Y E S T E R I) A V
showed no sign of moderating the
Russian position on Berlin and
Germany and was said to have
made it clear Russia will press
hard for changing the structure of
the United Nations to eliminate
(he Secretary General’s post.
Rusk and Gromyko yesterday in
addition to restating their nations'
positions, apparently spent some
time trying to clarify each others'
language.
The Secretary was understood
to have tried to find out just how
Russia intended to guarantee
Western access to a "free city”

of Berlin across Communist Ger
man territory if Khrushchev went
ahead with his plan to sign a
peace treaty with the local Reds
and give them sovereignty. It was
not known just what explanation
Gromyko gave.
IT WAS understood that the
question of possibly solving the
chaos at the United Nations tem
porarily by appointing an acting
Secretary General did not come
up during yesterday’s talks.
