BOSTON (UPD— Hurricane Es
ther smashed southern New Eng
land yesterday with flood tides
and up to four inches of rain, then
dwindled to a gale and headed out
to sea.

Electric power and communica
tions blackouts were widespread
in eastern Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, southeastern New Hamp
shire, and eastern Connecticut.
AT LEAST four deaths were at
tributed to the storm, three in
highway accidents on slick pave
ments and one heart
blamed on over-exertion.
The Red Cross alone counted
3,000 persons who had fled low
lying seacoast homes. Thousands
more had left homes in eastern
Long Island which experienced
tidal flooding on the storm fringe.
President Kennedy’s two chil
dren, Caroline, 3, anil John F. Jr.,
9 months and six Kennedy neph
ews and nieces were taken from
their beds before 6 a.m. EDT in
the summer White House com
pound at Hyannis Port and shel
tered at Otis Air Force Base. The
children returned home last night.
HURRICANE force winds bat
tered the coast briefly before sub
siding. The last hurricane-veloci
ty wind was reported unofficially
at 5 p.m. EDT at the Nantucket
Airport control tower. Personnel
left temporarily.
Hurricane warnings gave way
to gale warning at 5 p.m. EDT

but the Weather Bureau said Es
ther was still a “dangerous
storm.” It was expected to move
slowly up the coast, diminishing
strength.
The storm center, which was
heading for western Cape Cod,
took a northeasterly course late
in the afternoon, skirting the cape.
It was expected to hold its course
and 7-mile-an-hour speed until
early this morning, then turn east
northeast, keeping well away from
the Maine coast.
THE WIND at 5 p.m. had drop
ped to 70 miles an hour, five miles
less than hurricane velocity. At
its peak, the storm had 150-mile
an-hour winds.
The New England Telephone
Co. reported 18,000 telephones out
of service in Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and southeastern
New Hampshire, which had
strong winds and heavy lain.
