Coaching football is not the most secure job in the world. There
is steadier employment to he found, say like being president of Brazil.
Essentially, guiding the fortunes of 40 or 50 overly large athletes
through a schedule of in or so games, which resemble a kind of ritual
ized murder, is much like a game of musical chairs. Meaning you’re
always looking for a better Job or one not too much worse than the

one you have.
If you’re a good coach, or a
lucky one (some say the tw'o
terms are interchangable in this
context i you have to prove it on a
team which you don’t really care
to spend the rest of your days
with; like Muhlenberg or Ripon.
Nobody gets to start by coaching
important teams unless he’s 'Per
ry Brennan, who is now in the in
surance business or something
after making the mistake of los
ing nearly as many games as he
won for Notre Dame.
If you’re not good or lucky you
try to make your inevitable de
scent to a lesser team or another
profession as painless as possible.
An unsure lot is that of the foot
ball coach.
Let us now take the case of Jack
Curtice, presently beginning his
fourth year at the head of Stan
ford’s football fortunes. Curtice

is an amiable, balding sort who developed a reputation as a winning
coach and a funny man while coaching the likes of Texas Western,
West Texas Slate and Utah. In at least one respect he is considered
to be an excellent coach. That is in his development of the passing
game. He has even written a book on that phase of the game.
Curtice is responsible tor two All American quarterbacks. Stanford’s
Dick Norman and Lee Grosscup of Utah. Both are now playing pro
fessional football and both are excellent passers.

Smashing the Records
In his second year at Stanford, Curtice watched Norman break
some important national passing records and nearly every Stanford
aerial mark around. Although the former feat got most of the atten
tion, the latter was noteworthy as well, considering the passers Stan
ford has had in the past. Frankie Albert, John Brodie, etc. etc.
Perhaps Norman should be given some of the credit for the throwing
display, but it’s only fair that some of the luster should rub off
on the coach.
Stanford won only three games that year, hut many were in
spired to overlook that sorry fact by virtue of Norman’s performance
and the fact that he would be around next year. A few growls were
heard that the running game and the defense didn’t seem to be
quite up to the passing attack, but these few cynical souls were put
down with one or both of the following two seemingly irrefutable
arguments:
• The huge lumbering linemen were being kept out of
Stanford because of scholastic reasons and that wasn’t the
coach’s fault (To digress, you may be interested to learn that
down on the smog-filtered campus of UCLA this year - there
exists a 6-4, 248-pound lad who is playing third string left end
because he couldn’t crack the squad at tackle).
• Next year the situation could be expected to improve
because of the presence of two potentially fine senior linemen
(Doug Pursell and Dean Hinshaw, both hurt early in the
year) and several terrors up from the fresh and JV teams
(notably C. B. Simons).
Well, next year came and none hereabouts were grieved to see
it leave. Details will bo spared except to say that Stanford's last win
was over Oregon State and it wasn't last year.

Another Beginning
And now this year begins to unfurl its smiling length upon Jack
Curtice and his 68 football players, 43 of whom haven’t seen a minute
of varsity action. Few people predict miracles, least of all Curtice.
One wag in the Southland took note of the fact that the Stanford head
man was pictured,on the football pressbook with his hat on ready
for travel. The Southern Californian thought it a wise idea.
Somebody else said that Curtice could be the first president of
the Football Coaches Association to be jobless in mid-season. But he
was put down with, “Possibly, but on the other hand if tie wins two
or three games he could be Coach I

of the Year.”
Perhaps, however, the last w'ord
should bo given to somebody local.
It was Larry Royse, ex-student
body president who should be one
of the faster mortals in the Indian
baijjrfield ■ this year who said,
“‘There’s nothing wrong with Stan
ford football that a few wins
wouldn’t cure.”
It has been decided not to repeat
that one outside a three-mile radi
us of campus. Somebody might
say you could claim the same
thing for United States foreign
policy.
