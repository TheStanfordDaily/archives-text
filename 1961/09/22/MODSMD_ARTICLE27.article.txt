# TOUGH SCHEDULE AHEAD
## Big Five Opens Play Tomorrow 
### 
All five AAWU teams figure to
be banging heads with some of the
finest teams in the country as the
Big Five opens its 1961 slate to
morrow.
UCLA, consensus choice for the
league championship, opens
against the Air Force in Denver.
COACH Bill Barnes’ squad is
really loaded again this year and
is a pretty safe bet against the in
experienced Falcon eleven. Barnes
has the largest line at UCLA in
years and a backfield combination
which could outshine the Kilmer-
Smith-Johnson trio of last season.
His only problems center around
tailback Bob Smith, whom he con
siders a stronger runner than all-
American Bill Kilmer, but lacks
passing finesse.

The Trojans of Southern Cali
fornia, depending heavily on soph
omore flash Willie Brown, take on
Georgia Tech in the LA Coliseum.
USC has lost its big rugged line of
last year but has replaced it with
one of the fastest backfields on
the Coast.
Lynn Gaskill, a 9.7 sprinter,
and Bill Nelsen, agood running
quarterback, add to the Trojans’
breakaway threat.
GEORGIA TECH, trying to im
prove on a 5-5 mark last year, has
15 returning lettermen including
two fine senior backs in Chick
Granning and Billy Williamson.
Coach Bobby Dodd has a good
chance to break the ,500 barrier
this season, probably at the ex
pense of the Trojans.

California faces a rather gloomy
weekend, hosting the Texas Long
horns, who iate as one of the top
ten teams in (he nation and the
best in the Southwest. On top of
that, star quarterback Randy
Gold is a questionable starter
after twisting a knee in practice
Tuesday. He will be replaced by
Larry Baillett in the Bears’ split-T
attack. Cal’s only hope is that no
body gets hurt.
Washington faces traditionally
strong Purdue in Seattle and prob
ably rates a slight edge over the
unproven Boilermakers. Husky
Coach Jim Owens is unwilling to
admit how strong his team is, but
good overall speed and size up
front should make the Huskies
worthy challengers to UCLA’s
Rose Bowl hopes.

that, star quarterback Randy
Gold is a questionable starter
after twisting a knee in practice
Tuesday. He will be replaced by
Larry Baillett in the Bears’ split-T
attack. Cal’s only hope is that no
body gets hurt.
Washington faces traditionally
strong Purdue in Seattle and prob
ably rates a slight edge over the
unproven Boilermakers. Husky
Coach Jim Owens is unwilling to
admit how strong his team is, but
good overall speed and size up
front should make the Huskies
worthy challengers to UCLA’s
Rose Bowl hopes.
All five AAWU teams figure to
be banging heads with some of the
finest teams in the country as the
Big Five opens its 1961 slate to
morrow.
UCLA, consensus choice for the
league championship, opens
against the Air Force in Denver.
COACH Bill Barnes’ squad is
really loaded again this year and
is a pretty safe bet against the in
experienced Falcon eleven. Barnes
has the largest line at UCLA in
years and a backfield combination
which could outshine the Kilmer-
Smith-Johnson trio of last season.
His only problems center around
tailback Bob Smith, whom he con
siders a stronger runner than all-
American Bill Kilmer, but lacks
passing finesse.

The Trojans of Southern Cali
fornia, depending heavily on soph
omore flash Willie Brown, take on
Georgia Tech in the LA Coliseum.
USC has lost its big rugged line of
last year but has replaced it with
one of the fastest backfields on
the Coast.
Lynn Gaskill, a 9.7 sprinter,
and Bill Nelsen, agood running
quarterback, add to the Trojans’
breakaway threat.
GEORGIA TECH, trying to im
prove on a 5-5 mark last year, has
15 returning lettermen including
two fine senior backs in Chick
Granning and Billy Williamson.
Coach Bobby Dodd has a good
chance to break the ,500 barrier
this season, probably at the ex
pense of the Trojans.

California faces a rather gloomy
weekend, hosting the Texas Long
horns, who iate as one of the top
ten teams in (he nation and the
best in the Southwest. On top of
that, star quarterback Randy
Gold is a questionable starter
after twisting a knee in practice
Tuesday. He will be replaced by
Larry Baillett in the Bears’ split-T
