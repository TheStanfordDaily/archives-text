# U.N. Group Votes Testing Ban Talks
## 
### 
United Nations, N.Y.—( UPl)—The General Assembly Steering
Committee voted yesterday over Soviet opposition for immediate
United Nations discussion of a ban on ending nuclear tests after
hearing a U.S. charge that Russia might poison the atmosphere for
years to come.

The 20-memher Steering Com
mittee. which recommends items
for the Assembly’s agenda, voted
16 to 3 for a joint Anglo-American
proposal for a nuclear test debate.
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Rus
sia voted against. France ab
stained.
By an identical vote the com
mittee approved inclusion of an In
dian proposal for continuation of
the test moratorium broken last
month by Russia’s decision to
hold atmospheric explosions.
THE DECISION on whether to
debate nuclear test bans was a
curtain raiser for an even more
bitter debate on the admission of
Communist China.
Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson
told the committee Russia plans
to “go on poisoning the world’s
atmosphere” with deadly nuclear
radiation for years while a gen
eral disarmament treaty is being
negotiated.
Soviet Ambassador Valerian A.
Zorin accused the United States
of trying to “create a false impres
sion.” He said American under
ground nuclear tests would be fol
lowed by tests in the atmosphere.
Stevenson made his statement
after Zorin charged that the
United States wants to agree to
an end to nuclear tests only for
political profits and to legalize
underground tests needed to per
fect its nuclear arsenal.
BRITAIN AND the United Na
tions had asked for quick approv
al by the 99-nation Political Com
mittee of the need to debate nu
clear disarmament. But Zorin said
the question should be debated
only as-part of the broad disarma
ment question.
“How can you resume tests and
not give the Soviet Union the
same privilege?” Zorin asked.
Stevenson replied: “If the Sovi
et Union now regrets that a nu
clear testing agreement was not
concluded, it should search its
own conscience.
“Why did not the Soviet Union
in Geneva introduce a single posi
tive proposition over the past 18
months?” Stevenson asked. “Why
did it begin in the last sessions of
the Geneva talks to retreat from
agreements already reached?”
Why did it advance the doctrine
of the ‘Troika’ with a veto? Why
did it stubbornly refuse to con
sider inspection and verification
methods?
“ . . . Apparently, regardless of
the prayers of the world, it in

tends to go on developing nuclear
weapons and poisoning the at
mosphere . . . We can only hope
that the opposition of the Soviet
Union to inscription of this item
on the agenda does not mean it
proposes to go on poisoning the
world’s atmosphere until there is
agreement on all the complexities
of a general disarmament agree
ment.”
STEVENSON REFERRED to
the 14 nuclear explosions set off
so far by Russia since it ended the
ban on tests and said, “The Soviet
action not only heightens interna
tional tension (but! it impairs the
security of other countries and
has impelled the United States to
resume tests underground.”
The disarmament and Chinese
admission questions were among
the most controversial to face the
steering committee. The other
items ranged from discussion of
birth control through the prob
lems of Angola, Tunisia and the
Congo.
A major debate is expected
Tuesday when the Security Coun
cil meets to consider the applica
tions of three nations for member
ship - Outer Mongolia, Mauri
tania and Sierra Leone.
The Soviet Union demands that
Outer Mongolia and Mauritania
be voted on as a “package deal.”
Russia vetoed Mauritania’s mem
bership application last Decem
ber, after the Security Council
rejected Outer Mongolia’s appli
cation.

months?” Stevenson asked. “Why
did it begin in the last sessions of
the Geneva talks to retreat from

Why did it advance the doctrine
of the ‘Troika’ with a veto? Why
did it stubbornly refuse to con
sider inspection and verification
methods?
“ . . . Apparently, regardless of
the prayers of the world, it in

tends to go on developing nuclear
weapons and poisoning the at
mosphere . . . We can only hope
that the opposition of the Soviet
Union to inscription of this item
on the agenda does not mean it
proposes to go on poisoning the
world’s atmosphere until there is
agreement on all the complexities
of a general disarmament agree
ment.”
STEVENSON REFERRED to
the 14 nuclear explosions set off
so far by Russia since it ended the
ban on tests and said, “The Soviet
action not only heightens interna
tional tension (but! it impairs the
security of other countries and
has impelled the United States to
resume tests underground.”
The disarmament and Chinese
admission questions were among
the most controversial to face the
steering committee. The other
items ranged from discussion of
birth control through the prob
lems of Angola, Tunisia and the
Congo.
A major debate is expected
Tuesday when the Security Coun
cil meets to consider the applica

be voted on as a “package deal.”

United Nations, N.Y.—( UPl)—The General Assembly Steering
Committee voted yesterday over Soviet opposition for immediate
United Nations discussion of a ban on ending nuclear tests after
hearing a U.S. charge that Russia might poison the atmosphere for
years to come.

The 20-memher Steering Com
mittee. which recommends items
for the Assembly’s agenda, voted
16 to 3 for a joint Anglo-American
proposal for a nuclear test debate.
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Rus
sia voted against. France ab
stained.
By an identical vote the com
mittee approved inclusion of an In
dian proposal for continuation of
the test moratorium broken last
month by Russia’s decision to
hold atmospheric explosions.
THE DECISION on whether to
debate nuclear test bans was a
curtain raiser for an even more
bitter debate on the admission of
Communist China.
Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson
told the committee Russia plans
to “go on poisoning the world’s
atmosphere” with deadly nuclear
radiation for years while a gen
eral disarmament treaty is being
negotiated.
Soviet Ambassador Valerian A.
Zorin accused the United States
of trying to “create a false impres
sion.” He said American under
ground nuclear tests would be fol
lowed by tests in the atmosphere.
Stevenson made his statement
after Zorin charged that the
United States wants to agree to
an end to nuclear tests only for
political profits and to legalize
underground tests needed to per
fect its nuclear arsenal.
BRITAIN AND the United Na
tions had asked for quick approv
al by the 99-nation Political Com
mittee of the need to debate nu
clear disarmament. But Zorin said
the question should be debated
only as-part of the broad disarma
ment question.
“How can you resume tests and
not give the Soviet Union the
same privilege?” Zorin asked.
Stevenson replied: “If the Sovi
et Union now regrets that a nu
clear testing agreement was not
concluded, it should search its
own conscience.
“Why did not the Soviet Union
in Geneva introduce a single posi
tive proposition over the past 18
months?” Stevenson asked. “Why
did it begin in the last sessions of
the Geneva talks to retreat from

Why did it advance the doctrine
