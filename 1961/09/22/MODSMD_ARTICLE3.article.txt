## 
### RON RAPOPORT Associate Editor 
Tom Yoneda, a Stanford gradu
i ate student, will sail Sunday with
S four others from Hiroshima to the
Russian port of Vladivostok in
| protest of the Russian resumption
of nuclear tests.
Yoneda, a member of Breakers
who was graduated from Stanford
in 1960, last year entered Keio
University in Tokyo on a Stanford
exchange program and in April
went to the University’s Japan
study center in Waseda.
He will sail on the Phoenix, a
yacht owned by Dr. Earle L.
Reynolds, who -sailed into Pacific
testing grounds in 1958 in protest
of American nuclear testing. Rey
nolds’ wife, son and daughter will
also make the trip.
YONEDA. has written letters
both to Soviet Premier Khrush
chev and President Kennedy ex
plaining the trip.
The travelers on the Phoenix
have been refused visas by the
Soviet Embassy in Tokyo be
cause they wore called neither
tourists nor guests of the govern
ment.
Yoneda’s parents, Karl and
Elaine of San Francisco have said
they oppose their son’s plans. But
the elder Yoneda told The Daily.
“Tom is over 21 and it’s his de
cision.”
YONEDA’S father, a longshore
man, said. “Maybe Khrushchev
will be nice to Tom when he learns
he’s a San Francisco longshore
man’s son. We wore nice to
Khrushchev when he was here.”
A veteran of World War II in
China, Burma and India, the fa
ther said he and his wife also op
posed nuclear testing, "But I’m
an admirer of Harry Bridges, and
believe in collective action for
peace, not individual action like
Tom’s trip in Vladivostok.”
In his letter to Khrushchev, Yo
neda said, “Your decision (to re
sume testing) has . . . brought
fear to the hearts of many and
hatred to the hearts of some.
There is the immediate fear of
nuclear fallout which is presently
occurring in the northern hemi
sphere. There is the fear that the
Soviet Union is not sincere in its
desire for peace. There is the fear
that it is impossible to reach any
agreement with the Soviet Union.
There is the fear that the arms
race has no end except war.
“I DO NOT write for those who
have let their fears turn to hatred.
I write for those who believe that
these fears can be eliminated and
that in such an atmosphere, men
of sincerity will reach agreement.
The Soviet Union can contribute
to eliminating these fears and vo
creating an atmosphere by halting
her nuclear weapons tests now
and forever. She would thereby
show us that she is sincere and
is willing to set aside her national
interest for the benefit of all man
kind.”
To Kennedy, Yoneda wrote in
part, "Your recent decision to re
sume nuclear testing is a danger
ous retreat on the road towards
the banning of nuclear weapons.
I urge you to halt these tests and
to completely halt, unilaterally if
necessary, further testing. I be
lieve that this would be a positive
step to show the sincerity of our
government in the banning of nu
clear weapons.” (
