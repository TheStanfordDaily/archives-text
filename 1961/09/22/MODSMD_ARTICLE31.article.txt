# UAW to Try Reuther Plan
## 
### 
DETROIT (UPD—The United
Auto Workers’ national General
Motors council yesterday accepted
unanimously a new plan of UAW
President Walter P. Reuther for
ending local strikes against the
auto company.
Under the plan, local union lead
ers at strikebound plants will be
brought to Detroit in an effort to
work out settlements with nation
al UAW and GM officials.
The plan was a new attempt by
Reuther to quell sentiment for
continuing the local strikes at
one-fifth of GM's plants despite
an accord reached on national con
tract issues.
Wednesday night the council
had voted for a nationwide strike
against GM to support the locals
which still have not resolved their
plant-level disputes with GM.
