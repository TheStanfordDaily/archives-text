# Acceptance Rate Sets New High
## 
### 
Stanford’s acceptance rate
among high school seniors is
at its highest level in recent
years, a report from Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbig
ler shows.
THIS IS indicated by the en
tering freshman of 1,355,
about 90 more than normal,
Winbigler said. Applicants
had totaled 6,091.
These additional undergrad
uates. plus a 200-person in
crease in the number of grad
uate students, will bring the
University’s estimated total
registration for fall quarter
to more than 9,500 students.
Of the more than 9,500, ap
proximately 5,700 will be un
dergraduates and 3,850 will be
graduates, the dean said.
This compares with last
year’s figures of 5,613 under
grads and 3,636 grad students.
ABOUT 15 of the Class of
’65, those who live within
three miles of the campus,
have been asked to live at
home until campus accommo
dations can be found for
them, Winbigler reported.
One Of the major factors
in Stanford’s increased ac
ceptance, the dean’s report in
dicated, is Stanford’s overseas
study centers in Europe and
Japan.
