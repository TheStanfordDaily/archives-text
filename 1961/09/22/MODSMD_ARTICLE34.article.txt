# Congress OK's Peace Corps
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Con
gress yesterday passed and sent
to the White House a compromise
bill giving President Kennedyâ€™s
Peace Corps permanent status
and authorizing $4O million for its
first year operations.
The Senate approved the bill by
voice vote shortly after it cleared
the House on a 253-78 roll call.
The measure gives formal legal
backing to the Corps which has
been launched under a presi
dential order.
By next summer, the Peace
Corps hopes to have 2,700 young
American volunteers helping un
derdeveloped areas.
