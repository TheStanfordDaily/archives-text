# WHAT IT IS, HOW IT WORKS
## PACE – Plan of Action for a Challenging Era STANFORD PACE PROGRAM 
### 
“This is our boldest venture
since the University was found
ed.”
Thus spoke Stanford President
Wallace Sterling in April as the
University embarked on a drive to
raise $lOO million in three years to
reach a “peak of excellence” in
higher education.
It is the biggest gift sum ever
sought by an American university
I within so short a time.
ITS RESULTS, however, can al
ready be seen on campus and this
year’s freshmen and returning
students will benefit now not
just in two or three years - from
the drive.
Tresidder Union was finally
able to get underway as a result
of a needed sum from the $2O
million in PACE money already
in.
Able but needy students will at
tend school this year with PACE
dollars and urgently needed reno
vation of some Quad buildings has
been accomplished with money
j from the drive.
THE DRIVE came about after
the Ford Foundation had offered
Stanford a $25 million matching
grant with no strings attached
under terms whereby Stanford
1 will get one dollar for every three
I it raises on its own up to $75 mil
lion, thus giving the $lOO million
PACE goal.
The Ford grant was the largest
ever awarded a university and the
University was given five years
to meet the goal. It chose to try
it in three.
At the announcement luncheon
j last April, Sterling said he ven
j tured “to say (the drive) will
write another bright page in the
history of American higher edu
cation in a crucially important
period.”
A BREAKDOWN of “campaign
components” the highest pri
ority needs in the University’s
long range plans shows that
moie than a fourth of the $lOO
million $26 million is ear
marked for additional faculty and
improved salaries.
Another $lO million will be as
signed to scholarships, fellow
ships, loans, grants and other stu
dent services. Library operations
| will require $6 million.
While the building program was
1 greatly stepped up during the dec
ade of the fifties, the doubled post
war enrollment, now about 9,000,
has left it still seriously lagging.
A $41.5 million segment of the
anticipated new funds is assigned
to academic, residence and other
buildings, including the long
awaited $4,870,000 undergraduate
library. Also included in this
amount are urgently needed re
modeling and renovating of some
of the original Quad and other
structures, at estimated cost of
$12.5 million.
The remaining segment of $16.5
million will be used for continuing
annual support of existing pro
grams during the campaign, in
cluding teaching, research, stu
dent aid and general operations.
A SUBSTANTIAL part of the
new funds allocated to strengthen
and augment the faculty, student
aid and services, and library oper
ations about $3O million will
be reserved as permanent endow
ment, with only the income to be
spent annually.
Thus $71.5 million of the $lOO

million will he devoted to perma
nent assets, plant and endowment.
It will be next fall before the
general drive among the Farm's
70,000 alumni gets underway, led
by 6,000 volunteers. The main ef
fort will be from January to June
of 1963, according to Dick O’Brien,
head of the drive.
ORGANIZATION and solicita
tion of big gifts is underway now.
From 100 to 125 regions will be sot
up in the country for the general

drive, with headquarters in such
cities as New York, Houston, San
Diego, Phoenix, Portland, Boston,
Chicago and many others.
O’Brien points out the import
ance of the solicitation of wealthy
Foundations by noting that 60 to
individuals, corporations and
70 per cent of the $lOO million will
come from gifts of $lOO,OOO or
more.
O’Brien says a version of the
drive’s aims and operations aimed
at students will be put out in the
future. Several programs already
have been held explaining the
drive to various student leaders,
and two letters have been mailed
to each student since the drive be
gan,
808 HIND, publicity director
for the drive, says the University
hopes to hold the costs of the cam
paign to three per cent of the total
or less if possible.
University officials expect to
reach the $lOO million mark with
in three years. As Thomas P. Pike,
president of the Board of Trus

tees, says: "I look ahead without
misgivings. Stanford has never
failed to meet a major challenge
in her 70 years of proud history,
and it has had many of them.”
