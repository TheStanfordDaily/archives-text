“ . . . A place where an en
gineering major will be found
browsing through a volume of
Keats or a French major will
while away a couple of hours with
Einstein or Newton ...”
Thus does one hopeful official
portray the future for Stanford's
long-awaited new undergraduate
library, which, sometime in the
next two or three years, will be
built astride Escondido Road and
behind Cubberly Auditorium.
THE graceful, three-story struc
ture has top priority in the PACE
drive.
The new library will draw 4,-
875,000 of the PACE dollars and
be an undergraduate reader's
paradise, if a look at plans for the
building are any indication.
Designed to remove all barriers
between the reader and the book,
the Stanford structure will be the
first such undergraduate library
west of the Mississippi, and only
the third one in the nation. Har
vard put up the first one, followed
by the University of Michigan.
LOCATED AT the end of Es
condido Road, the library Mill

straddle Escondido and lake up
the spare now occupied by part
of the Stern Hall parking lot, the
Cubberly parking lot a 1 Hu
“temporary" buildings behind
Cubberly.
It obviously will be at I he hub
of campus traffic. In fact, stu
dents heading for the Quad area
from Eranner, Wilbur and Stern
will have to walk through iv li
brary to reach the Engineering
Corner area.
The ground floor wi’l ’ e bisect
od by an open area for through

difficult for students in Wilbur
rmner-S’ern v ’ o have neglect
, d studies to use the tra litiona.l
rationalization of “I didn’t get
re n r (lie libe today.”
One feature of the library will
be a three-story glass-willed
shaft, surmounted by a -skylight
in the center. This will admit ighf
to (he center of the library and
serve as a stairwell.
THE vaulted arcade design in
iliatod in the bookstore and post
office is to be utilized and the re
inforced concrete structure will
be topped by the Farm’s tradi
tional red-tiled roof.
The advanced planning of the
library will free students to pur
sue their interests as if they were
in a well-stocked home library -----
expanded about 150 times.
Eventually some 150,000 vol

umes on a wide range of cultural
subjects will be shelved on open,
freestanding stacks.
IN TEA!) of a loft-sized read
ing room, there wi’l be many inti
mate reading centers, interspersed
with stacks. Some of the 100,000
square feet of floor space will be
given over to study tables and
some to lounge chairs. Wherever
a student finds a book, he can
drop into a chair to read it.
Outdoor reading pavilions will
be spotted around the grounds and
on roof terraces formed by the
variation between two and three
stoi ies.
SKMiXAR and listening rooms,
a lobby and loan facilities, a small
“re; ly reference” collection, gen
eral periodicals, a set-up for pro
jecting art prints, s jund-proof
■ yplng rooms and small confer
ee > rooms also will be put into
the building.
The main library still will be
t he center of specialized study and
research pursuits of undergradu
ates and graduates alike.
A committee of faculty and ad
ministrative officers recently de
clared in a sentiment undoubt
edly echoed silently through the
years by thousands of Stanford
students.’ “no project could do
more for undergraduate education
at Stanford than a first-class un
dergraduate library.”
