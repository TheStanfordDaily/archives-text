## PACE Drive Total Reaches $20 Million 
### 
Stanford’s PACE drive has
passed the $20 million mark in the
effort to raise $100 million.
In the first report since the cam
paign was announced April 18,
co-chairmen James B. Black and
Edward R. Valentine reported the
program total on Aug. 1 was $20,-
445,674.
They called it “an encouraging
beginning’’ and noted the mark
was passed less than four months
after the drive started. Advance
gifts of $7.4 million to PACE were
announced at the drive’s begin
ning.
THE $20 million includes, how
ever, gifts and pledges which
would have come in without the
drive. Continuing gift programs
dur ing the academic year starting
Sept. 1, 1960 also are included in
the figure.
The announcement disclosed
that two gifts of more than a mil
lion dollars each are in hand, but
at the donors’ request their names
were not revealed.
Other major gifts include a
pledge of $400,000 from a corpora
tion.
I>AVII) Packard, national chair
man of the Major Gifts Commit
tee, said the achievement so far
“is very creditable,” but noted
the continuing support gifts and
said many new gifts of substantial
size will be essential if Stanford
is to achieve its goal.
Stanford President Wallace Ster
ling called the early months’ prog
ress “gratifying,” especially in
view of the time and energy re
quired for mobilizing and organ
izing the campaign during its in
itial phases.
The response of those making
gifts shows an increasing appre
ciation, he said, of “the dimen
sions and opportunities of higher
education at Stanford and the fact
that the dollars given are trans
lated inlo better teaching and re
search for a first rate student
body and faculty, and thus service
to the nation.”

STERLING pointed out Ford
Foundation dollars gained in the
drive are unrestricted as to use,
and thus can be put to work im
mediately for urgent PACE pro
gram objectives as the periodic
payments are received.

In the first report since the cam
paign was announced April 18,
co-chairmen James B. Black and
Edward R. Valentine reported the
program total on Aug. 1 was $20,-
445,674.
They called it “an encouraging
beginning’’ and noted the mark
was passed less than four months
after the drive started. Advance
gifts of $7.4 million to PACE were
announced at the drive’s begin
ning.
THE $20 million includes, how
ever, gifts and pledges which
would have come in without the
drive. Continuing gift programs
dur ing the academic year starting
Sept. 1, 1960 also are included in
the figure.
The announcement disclosed
that two gifts of more than a mil
lion dollars each are in hand, but
at the donors’ request their names
were not revealed.
Other major gifts include a
pledge of $400,000 from a corpora
tion.
I>AVII) Packard, national chair
man of the Major Gifts Commit
tee, said the achievement so far
“is very creditable,” but noted
the continuing support gifts and
said many new gifts of substantial
size will be essential if Stanford
is to achieve its goal.
Stanford President Wallace Ster
ling called the early months’ prog
ress “gratifying,” especially in
view of the time and energy re
quired for mobilizing and organ
izing the campaign during its in
itial phases.
The response of those making
gifts shows an increasing appre
ciation, he said, of “the dimen
sions and opportunities of higher
education at Stanford and the fact
that the dollars given are trans
lated inlo better teaching and re
search for a first rate student
body and faculty, and thus service
to the nation.”

STERLING pointed out Ford
Foundation dollars gained in the
drive are unrestricted as to use,
and thus can be put to work im
mediately for urgent PACE pro
gram objectives as the periodic
payments are received.
