### 
Studies in the psychology of
language learning, with experi
ments conducted in Russian, are
to be undertaken at Stanford.
A grant of over $129 thousand
from the U.S. office of education
makes possible the studies to be
made by the Laboratory for Quan
titative Research in Education and
the Institute for Mathematical
Studies in tho Social Sciences.
Equipment, such as the com
puter to be used to analyze data,
was obtained through a grant of
the Carnegie Corporation of Nev
York.
Dr. Patrick Suppes, director of
the Institute for Mathematical
Studies in the Social Sciences;
Richard Atkinson, associate pro
fessor of psychology and educa
tion, and Mrs. Ruth Weir, assist
ant professor of linguistics and
education will conduct the investi
gation.
The studies will be highlighted
by comparisons of pattern drills
versus “component word’’ learn
ing, the rate of intake and forget
ting, and reaction time and con
trol.
