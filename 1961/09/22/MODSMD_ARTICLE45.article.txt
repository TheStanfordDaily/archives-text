# Freshman Dean Dwight Clark Plans House System Step-up
## 
### 
There’s a now sign on the door
(o the Wilbur Hall office—and
with it has come a change in the
concept of housing for freshman
men.
The sign: “Office of the Wilbur
Houses.’’
It signifies the change brought
about by the house system from
the time when the sign on the
door read simply: “Wilbur Hall.”
THU house system at Wilbur
enters its third year this fall un
der the direction of Dwight Clark,
who took over this summer in the
newly-created fulltime position
of dean of freshman men.
I

Clark feels “we’re to the place* I
now where the house plan can
really move into high gear.”
Basic idea of the house plan
“is that living and learning, social
and intellectual life, should not be
separate but together.”
TO CARRY this theme out, the
house system at Wilbur attempts
to make the residents of the eight
houses feel as if they are resi
dents of the house rather than
the hall.
Thus the point has been reached
where the freshman tells some
one he lives in Rinconada or Soto
rather than in Wilbur.
“We give them the job of keep
ing their own house going,” Clark
explains. If at all possible, the
plan with a problem is “to toss
it back to the house” and let the
house members of the house ju
dicial council come up with a de
cision.
“DURING the first year we
must make clear to the student
the potential and freedom here
for self” and group development,
Clark declares.
To develop this potential there
must be a “free, frank atmos
phere for men to find out who
they arc—to try on many faces
in order to find which one is
theirs.
“Wo can’t ask students to de
velop the qualities of reason and
responsibility on Quad and then
walk back to their residences and
passively accept whatever is of
fered.
“THE quality and variety of
life offered will be and can only
be of their own making.”
Clark stresses the value of a
freshman “rubbing shoulders”
with his classmates.
“For most freshmen, these
houses offer their- first experience
in group living. This ongoing
accommodation of, tolerance for,
a wide range of personalities,
values, standards of conduct and
background of experience is an
intense kind of educational ex

perience.
“THE FKESH.MAX year is the
only one in which a student here
lives with this full range of in
dividuals in his class. From the
sophomore year on, the process of
‘likes choosing likes’ restricts this
range in any given living group.
“If there is a value to meeting,
living with, growing to under
stand a wide range of people, then
we must make the most of the
freshman year.”
As a result of the “rubbing
shoulders” philosophy, freshmen

are not thrown together haphaz
ardly, but are paired so that men
from diverse backgrounds, educa
tional experiences, geographical
areas and so on live together.
f’LAHK believes “The house
system flourished in its first two
years because it brings out a
greater degree of the freshman
year’s potential” than other sys
tems.
An indication of its success
since 1959 is that “the amount of
damage has gone down” notice
ably in Wilbur meaning the
frosh apparently are developing
pride in their house and regard
it as more than a place to sleep
and eat.
Surveys taken at the end of
each freshman’s stay in Wilbur
show that where 40 to 50 per cent
of the men felt their year in the
hall was a success before the
house plan, 80 to 90 per cent call
it a success now.
C LARK WOULD like to see a
Wilbur Hall more involved in all
phases of campus life. “We can
become a more vital part of the
campus as a whole” he says.
He hopes to see groups of fresh
men doing such things as working
together during spring vacation
on a needy Indian reservation or
helping in youth work.

Houses in Wilbur also can get
behind particular campus proj
ects or organizations which es
pecially interest them, Clark
points out.
HE adds that “there needs to be
more discussion” about the pres
sure of grades. A freshman, he
warns, must make “a realistic
appraisal of what the University
wants him to do and what he
wants to do.”
He emphasizes the fact that
“freshman grades aren’t particu
larly representative of what their
grades will be over the long pull
of four years.
“One of the most important
things we can teach is how to fail

_ and fail well,” he declares.
| Clark also notes that the all
campus men’s grade average is
2.!5 much lower than many stu
dents realize.
C'I.AKK is, at 27, probably the
youngest member of the admin
istration.
He holds an A.B. and M.A. from
Stanford in political science and
is working for his doctorate in
counseling and higher' education
in the School of Education.
A native of Colorado, he was
head sponsor in Wilbur in 1957-58.
He sees “much more of an aca
demic emphasis and emphasis on
the government of the houses”
now compared with then.

DWIGHT CLARK NEW DEAN OF FRESHMAN MEN
Housing concept change indicated by new sign on door
There’s a now sign on the door
(o the Wilbur Hall office—and
with it has come a change in the
concept of housing for freshman
men.
The sign: “Office of the Wilbur
Houses.’’
It signifies the change brought
about by the house system from
the time when the sign on the
door read simply: “Wilbur Hall.”
THU house system at Wilbur
enters its third year this fall un
der the direction of Dwight Clark,
who took over this summer in the
newly-created fulltime position
of dean of freshman men.
I

Clark feels “we’re to the place* I
now where the house plan can
really move into high gear.”
Basic idea of the house plan
“is that living and learning, social
and intellectual life, should not be
separate but together.”
TO CARRY this theme out, the
house system at Wilbur attempts
to make the residents of the eight
houses feel as if they are resi
dents of the house rather than
the hall.
Thus the point has been reached
where the freshman tells some
one he lives in Rinconada or Soto
rather than in Wilbur.
“We give them the job of keep
ing their own house going,” Clark
explains. If at all possible, the
plan with a problem is “to toss
it back to the house” and let the
house members of the house ju
dicial council come up with a de
cision.
“DURING the first year we
must make clear to the student
the potential and freedom here
for self” and group development,
Clark declares.
To develop this potential there
must be a “free, frank atmos
phere for men to find out who
they arc—to try on many faces
in order to find which one is
theirs.
“Wo can’t ask students to de
velop the qualities of reason and
responsibility on Quad and then
walk back to their residences and
passively accept whatever is of
fered.
“THE quality and variety of
life offered will be and can only
be of their own making.”
Clark stresses the value of a
freshman “rubbing shoulders”
with his classmates.
“For most freshmen, these
houses offer their- first experience
in group living. This ongoing
accommodation of, tolerance for,
a wide range of personalities,
values, standards of conduct and
background of experience is an
intense kind of educational ex

perience.
“THE FKESH.MAX year is the
only one in which a student here
lives with this full range of in
dividuals in his class. From the
sophomore year on, the process of
‘likes choosing likes’ restricts this
range in any given living group.
“If there is a value to meeting,
living with, growing to under
stand a wide range of people, then
we must make the most of the
freshman year.”
As a result of the “rubbing
shoulders” philosophy, freshmen

are not thrown together haphaz
ardly, but are paired so that men
from diverse backgrounds, educa
tional experiences, geographical
areas and so on live together.
f’LAHK believes “The house
system flourished in its first two
years because it brings out a
greater degree of the freshman
year’s potential” than other sys
tems.
An indication of its success
since 1959 is that “the amount of
damage has gone down” notice
ably in Wilbur meaning the
frosh apparently are developing
pride in their house and regard
it as more than a place to sleep
and eat.
Surveys taken at the end of
each freshman’s stay in Wilbur
show that where 40 to 50 per cent
of the men felt their year in the
hall was a success before the
house plan, 80 to 90 per cent call
it a success now.
C LARK WOULD like to see a
Wilbur Hall more involved in all
phases of campus life. “We can
become a more vital part of the
campus as a whole” he says.
He hopes to see groups of fresh
men doing such things as working
together during spring vacation
on a needy Indian reservation or
helping in youth work.

Houses in Wilbur also can get
behind particular campus proj
ects or organizations which es
pecially interest them, Clark
points out.
HE adds that “there needs to be
more discussion” about the pres
sure of grades. A freshman, he
warns, must make “a realistic
appraisal of what the University
wants him to do and what he
wants to do.”
He emphasizes the fact that

DWIGHT CLARK NEW DEAN OF FRESHMAN MEN
Housing concept change indicated by new sign on door
There’s a now sign on the door
(o the Wilbur Hall office—and
with it has come a change in the
concept of housing for freshman
men.
The sign: “Office of the Wilbur
Houses.’’
It signifies the change brought
about by the house system from
the time when the sign on the
door read simply: “Wilbur Hall.”
THU house system at Wilbur
enters its third year this fall un
der the direction of Dwight Clark,
who took over this summer in the
newly-created fulltime position
of dean of freshman men.
I

Clark feels “we’re to the place* I
now where the house plan can
really move into high gear.”
Basic idea of the house plan
“is that living and learning, social
and intellectual life, should not be
separate but together.”
TO CARRY this theme out, the
house system at Wilbur attempts
to make the residents of the eight
houses feel as if they are resi
dents of the house rather than
the hall.
Thus the point has been reached
where the freshman tells some
one he lives in Rinconada or Soto
rather than in Wilbur.
“We give them the job of keep
ing their own house going,” Clark
explains. If at all possible, the
plan with a problem is “to toss
it back to the house” and let the
house members of the house ju
dicial council come up with a de
cision.
“DURING the first year we
must make clear to the student
the potential and freedom here
for self” and group development,
Clark declares.
To develop this potential there
must be a “free, frank atmos
phere for men to find out who
they arc—to try on many faces
in order to find which one is
theirs.
“Wo can’t ask students to de
velop the qualities of reason and
responsibility on Quad and then
walk back to their residences and
passively accept whatever is of
fered.
“THE quality and variety of
life offered will be and can only
be of their own making.”
Clark stresses the value of a
freshman “rubbing shoulders”
with his classmates.
“For most freshmen, these
houses offer their- first experience
in group living. This ongoing
accommodation of, tolerance for,
a wide range of personalities,
values, standards of conduct and
background of experience is an
intense kind of educational ex

perience.
“THE FKESH.MAX year is the
only one in which a student here
lives with this full range of in
dividuals in his class. From the
sophomore year on, the process of
‘likes choosing likes’ restricts this
range in any given living group.
“If there is a value to meeting,
living with, growing to under
stand a wide range of people, then
we must make the most of the
freshman year.”
As a result of the “rubbing
shoulders” philosophy, freshmen

are not thrown together haphaz
ardly, but are paired so that men
from diverse backgrounds, educa
tional experiences, geographical
areas and so on live together.
f’LAHK believes “The house
system flourished in its first two
years because it brings out a
greater degree of the freshman
year’s potential” than other sys
tems.
An indication of its success
since 1959 is that “the amount of
damage has gone down” notice
ably in Wilbur meaning the
frosh apparently are developing
pride in their house and regard
it as more than a place to sleep
and eat.
