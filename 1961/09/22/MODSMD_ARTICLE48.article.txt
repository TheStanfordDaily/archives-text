# JFK WAS HERE
## On Way to Washington 
### 
“You have no idea how it feels
to yell for a winning team,” the
handsome, wavy - haired young
Stanford student said as he
praised the Farm’s powerful grid
iron machine in 1940.
The praise was well placed, as
the Indian squad rolled up a win
ning season of 10 wins and no
losses, capped by a 21-13 victory
over Nebraska in the Rose Bowl.
TWENTY years later, this ex
student, still wavy-haired and
handsome, had a pretty good sea
son himself -rolling up more than
33 million votes to become tlie
35th president of the United
States.
That’s right. John Fitzgerald
Kennedy is a former Stanford
student.
The future president registered
here in September of 1940 under
a "permit to attend,” which gave
him permission to audit classes
of his own choice without credit.
HIS CAREER at Stanford was
cut short when he left to join the
Navy around Christmas,
An article by Jean Nowell in
The Daily of Oct. 16, 1940, quotes
Kennedy on his reason for at
tending Stanford:
“1 picked Stanford principally
because of your ex-student body
president and student manager
Tom Killefer. He was my broth
er’s roommate at Harvard, and
he sneered so at the Florida cli
mate when he was staying with
us there that I had to find out if
it really was the climate or just
Killefer.
“SO FAR he’s right, but wait

until I see that first cloud . . . ”
It was then that he spoke of the
Farm’s football team. Miss Nowell
wrote that he was amazed “at the
rooting section’s spirit and thinks
the women probably have some
thing to do with it.”
He told the Daily reporter “At
Harvard, whenever they ask for
undergraduate opinion on what
would improve the school, about
80 per cent of the l suggestions are
to make the school co-education
al.”
HE SAID he planned to go into
some form of business law even
tually. He came here after three
and one half years at Harvard
and six months at the London
School of Economics.
Kennedy took most of his
courses in the Graduate School
of Business, but also audited a
couple of political science classes.
Prof. Theodore M. Keeps in the
business school had Kennedy in a
class on business and govern
ment. He remembers the 23-year
old youth as “a very able lad”
with “a good . . . independent
mind.”
KKEPS says Kennedy was
entered in his grade book and
“I’m sure he would have come out
with an A if he had finished it.”
Prof. Leland T. Chapin, now a
professor of speech and drama,
notes “I was very impressed with
his alertness and his interest in
England.”
The future President’s book
“Why England Slept"—an anal
ysis of the Munich affair and
Britain’s unpreparedness for war

-had been published in 1938 and
drawn a favorable reception.
KENNEDY'S father, Joseph,
was ambassador to England at
that time.
“f used to see (JFK) on cam
pus, and he was always friendly
and cordial,” Chapin adds.
Chapin was present when Ken
nedy registered for the draft, and
remembers that the Palo Alto
Times identified him as Kennedy
and Kennedy as Chapin in the
caption under the picture they
ran, thus making Chapin a future
president.
KENNEDY apparently was fa
vorably impressed with Stanford,
telling Miss Nowell in the inter
view, “f think I'll have one of
my sisters come here.”
And come they did. Eunice, now
Mrs. Robert S. Shriver Jr., was
graduated from Stanford in 1944
with an A.B. in -social science, al
though her final work for her de
gree was done elsewhere.
In a letter written recently, she
remarks “I attended Stanford at
the suggestion of my brother,
President Kennedy, who had gone

I thei'e before me and thought it
j a very fine university.
“MY MOTHER came to Stan
j ford for two or three months to
| visit me, and during that time she
[audited a few courses. She, too,
I liked (he university very much.”
Another Kennedy sister, Pa
tricia—now Mrs. Peter Lawford
also attended Stanford in the sum
mer of 1943.
The president recently wrote
an acquaintance. “I want to as
sure you that I remember ... my
experience at Stanford very pleas
antly.”
The acquaintance, Mrs. Oran V.
Prejean of Dallas, says “Every
one thought he was very glam
orous.”
So, Harvard is not the only uni
versity with a claim to the cur
rent resident of 1600 Pennsyl
vania Avenue.
