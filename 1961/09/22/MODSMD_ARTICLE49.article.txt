# MAN'S TOY
## Abacus Arithmetic Now in 5th Printing 
### 
As a "joke,” a retired Stanford
professor in 1958 wrote a book on
how to work the abacus, the an
cient Chinese computing device.
To his surprise, the 70-page, pa
per-bound “Abacus Arithmetic”
has sold more than 25,000 copies,
is now in its fifth printing and is
still going strong in bookstores
around the nation.
THE professor is Col. Welton J.
Crook, professor emeritus in the
Department of Materials Science
since 1952.
“It was a joke as far as I was
concerned.” he says of the decision
to write the book after a trip to
the Orient in 1958.
The “joke” has turned a neat
profit for Crook and his publisher,
Stanley M. Croonquist of Palo
Alto’s Pacific Books. Inc,
“I THINK it’s an impulse item,”
Croonquist says. He feels buyers
pick up the red-covered book as a
novelty, or “a man’s toy.”
Along with the $1.50 book,
Croonquist sells imported abac
about three books for every two
abacuses,” he reports.
The Harvard University book
store last year listed the book in
its Christmas catalog and imme
diately sold out and had to order
twice more before the demand
was satisfied.
CKOONQIJIST notes, however,
“It’s hard to convince bookstores
they would have a market for
‘Abacus Arithmetic.’ ”
Crook, in fact, had to convince
Croonquist that there would be
any interest in such a book.
“Fascinated with the lightning
speed and . . . accuracy” of the

abacus on his trip to the Orient,
Crook “decided to write a small
book of my own” on the subject.
It took him two weeks to write
and illustrate the book.
HE COMPARED this with a
technical book he spent four “pain
ful” years writing, which was
published in 1935 and sold 1,200
copies.
“I didn’t make a red cent out of
it,” he recalls.
The 75-year-old Crook, still ac
tive in his Stanford lab and in
metallurgical consulting work,
says “I wish I could think up an
other (idea) as good.”
