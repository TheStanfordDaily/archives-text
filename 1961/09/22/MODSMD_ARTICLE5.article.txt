## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI)
The General Assembly’s steer
ing committee voted last night to
put the question of a U.N. seat for
Communist China on the world
parliament's agenda for debate.
The United States supported the
proposal to throw the China repre
sentation issue open to full de
bate in the Assembly for the first
time since 1950.

For the past 10 years, the
United States has successfully
proposed that the Assembly
shelve the China issue for the
duration of the Assembly. But
dwindling majorities and increas
ing demands to debate the issue
led Washington to agree to a
full discussion this year.
The 20-nation steering commit
tee actually recommended inclu
sion in the agenda of two items
on China.

One, proposed by New Zealand
with Western backing, was en
titled simply “The question of the
representation of China in the
United Nations.” It was approved
by a 15-0 vote, with Russia, Bul
garia, Czechoslovakia, Costa Rica
and Nationalist China abstaining.
The other, proposed by Russia,
bore the title, objected to by sev
eral powers as prejudging the is
sue, of “Restoration of the lawful
rights of the People’s Republic of
China in the United Nations.” It
was approved by a 7-3 vote with
10 abstentions.
Russia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovak
ia, Ghana, Denmark, Niger and
Liberia voted for the Soviet pro
posal. Costa Rica, Nationalist Chi
na and the Philippines opposed it.
Argentina, Italy, Panama, Cyprus.
Franco, Greece, Mexico. The Neth
erlands, the United Kingdom and
tlie United States abstained.
