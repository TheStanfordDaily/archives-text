## 
### JUDY SHEAR Associate Editor 
President Wallace Sterling gave
(he 1362 members of the Class of
’65 a view of a university, Stan
ford and the academic community
Wednesday when he welcomed the
Freshmen to the paradoxical
"idealized tradition” of the uni
versity.
In the traditional Convocation
ceremony in Frost Amphitheater,
Sterling said that “to know uni
versities is to know from histori
cal experience that they have not
always lived up to the ideal which
is embedded in their age-old as
pirations. — in short, in their tra
dition. That is why tradition is
idealized.”
He pointed to the “centuries
long experience of universities;
their vital durability in surviving
war, revolution and other manifes
tations of social strife; their stub
born insistence on searching for
new knowledge and new insights
without fear or favor, — the so
called pursuit of truth.”
HE NOTED however that uni
versities, like all human institu
tions, are imperfect.
‘Sometimes they have fallen un
der the blight of censorship or a
requirement to serve a party lino.
Sometimes their members, — fac
ulty, students, and officers alike,
— have failed to act with respon
sibility and so have weakened that
freedom which is essential to tiie
pursuit of truth.”
Sterling stressed that Stanford
will try to accord students the op
portunity to pursue knowledge
wherever it may lead and called
upon them to use responsibility
and judgment in the pursuit.
STERLING stressed that fresh
men should take the initiative in
self-competition—or self-improve
ment — to make full use of an in
dividual's special combination of
abilities.
“Keep your faces into the wind,
your feel on the ground, and your
eyes on the stars,” he said. He
added that this can be done with
out any contortion and further
more that it will be enjoyable.
