# Frosh Delay SP's Trains
## 
### 
The arrival of 50 freshmen ear
ly Wednesday held up hundreds
of commuters and put Southern
Pacific trains behind schedule un
til 9 a.m.

The frosh came into the Palo
Alto SP depot at 7:30 a.m. aboard
the Los Angeles-San Francisco
“Lark.” They were mot by 37
Pre-Reg members, a group of
peppy pom-pon girls and a sleepy
eyed band.
While observers of the last few
Frosh “Lark” arrivals noted a
smaller than usual number of
frosh on the train, the 50 still
brought six truckloads of baggage
with them.
The train, which usually stops
in Paly for four or five minutes,
was held up for 20 minutes. The
delay stopped three San Francis
co-bound commute trains, accord
ing to Chief Clerk R. A. Clatcs of
the SP depot.
“But it happens every year, so
I suppose most commuters are
used to the delay,” he added.
The commuters on the SP plat
form looked on amusedly as the
red-and-white-clad pom-pon girls
cheered the train in. Porters and
train passengers stared back at
them from the “Lark.”
The band arrived after the in
coming freshmen, but apparently
the sleepy musicians were noticed.
