TIIK DAILY publishes Monday
through Friday mornings during
the school year except for dead
and finals weeks. It is entirely stu
dent run and is one of the nation’s
most independent college papers.
It has a press run of 10,000 and
reaches an average of 14,000 per
sons daily. The Daily is one of a
handful of full-size college papers,
and is the ninth oldest collegiate
daily in the country.
The forerunner of The Daily,,
and the first paper on the campus,
appeared Dec. 9, 1891 in the form
of the Sequoia, just two months
after the University opened its
doors.
IT lasted until Sept. 19, 1892,
when the first issue of The Daily
Palo Alto was turned out in Red
wood City. A daily paper so soon
after the founding of a university
was a record which still stands.
In that first issue the editor
wrote, ‘‘True it is that the daily
(paper) will not make a great uni
versity. but just as true is it that
the daily is one of the signs of a
great university.”
The first press on campus, set
up for the “Dippy” as the DPA
was called, eventually became the
Stanford Press. The Daily Palo
Alto became The Stanford Daily
in 1926.
TODAY’S Daily is an $BO,OOO-a
-year business. It publishes about
140 times a year and has a na
tional advertising service plus
complete state, national and inter
national news coverage through
United Press International.
Cartoonist Herblock and colum
nist Walter Lippman are regular
features of the editorial page.
Anyone interested in The Daily,
whether he wishes to work on it
or not, is invited to the open
house.
