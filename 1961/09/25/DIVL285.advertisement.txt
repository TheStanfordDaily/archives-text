from the Marlboro home office in New York City. But it should
be pointed out that Mr. Sigafoos is not required to be at work
until 10 A.M.
But I digress. This column, I say, will take up questions of
burning interest to the academic world—like “Should French
conversation classes be conducted in English?’’ and “Should
students be allowed to attend first hour classes in pajamas and
robes?” and “Can a student of 18 find happiness with an eco
nomics professor of 90?”
Because many of you are new to college, especially freshmen,
perhaps it would be well in this opening column to start with
campus fundamentals. What, for example, does “Alma Mater”
mean? Well, sir, “Alma Mater” is Latin for “send money”.
What does “Dean” mean? Well, sir, “Dean” is Latin for
.“don’t get caught”.
What does “dormitory” mean? Well, sir, “dormitory” is
Latin for "bed of pain”.
Next, let us discuss student-teacher relationships. In college
the keynote of the relationship between student and teacher is
informality. When you meet a teacher on campus, you need
not salute. Simply tug your forelock. If you are bald and have
no forelock, a low curtsey will suffice. In no circumstances
should you polisli a teacher’s car or sponge and press his suit.
It is, however, permissible to worm his dog.
With the President of the University, of course, your relation
ship will be a bit more formal. When you encounter the Presi
dent, fling yourself prone on the sidewalk and sing loudly:
V Prexy is wise
Prexy is true
Prexy has eyes
Of Lake Louise blue.”
As you can see, the President of the University is called
“Prexy”. Similarly, Deans are called “Dixie”. Professors are
called “Proxie”. Housemothers are called “Hoxie Moxie”.
Students are called “Amoebae”.
