“Cure for job boredom:
I made my favorite
pastime my career!”
Richard Bertram, President
Bertram Yacht Co., Division of Nautec Corp.
“When you stop to think what percent of our total waking
hours is spent bread-winning, you realize how tragic it is
for any man to work at an occupation he doesn’t enjoy.
Besides frittering away life, it reduces chances of success
to just about zero. I know... because it almost happened
to me!
After college, I did what I thought was expected of me
and joined a solid, Manhattan-based insurance firm. I
soon found office routine wasn’t for me. I lived only for
lunch hour when I could walk to the Battery and mentally
sail with the ships that stood out in the Narrows . . . and
for the summer weekends when I could go sailing. Fortu
nately, the company I worked for is one of the leading
insurers of yachts and after two years I was transferred
to their Yacht Underwriting Department. Enjoyment and
interest in my work improved immediately 100%.
After World War 11, I started my own yacht brokerage
firm and yacht insurance agency in Miami, combining my
marine insurance background with an even closer rela
tionship with boats.
My only problem ever since has been a feeling of guilt
that my work was too easy. I love boats and boating
people. That affection has paid me rewards way beyond
the financial security it has also provided.
The moral’s obvious. You have an odds-on chance for
success and happiness working at what you enjoy most
what comes naturally! And if it’s not just frivolous, your
life’s work could well be what you now consider just a
pastime. It’s certainly worth thinking about, anyway!”

insurers of yachts and after two years I was transferred
to their Yacht Underwriting Department. Enjoyment and
interest in my work improved immediately 100%.
After World War 11, I started my own yacht brokerage
firm and yacht insurance agency in Miami, combining my
marine insurance background with an even closer rela
tionship with boats.
My only problem ever since has been a feeling of guilt
that my work was too easy. I love boats and boating
people. That affection has paid me rewards way beyond
the financial security it has also provided.
The moral’s obvious. You have an odds-on chance for
success and happiness working at what you enjoy most
what comes naturally! And if it’s not just frivolous, your
life’s work could well be what you now consider just a
pastime. It’s certainly worth thinking about, anyway!”

Career Cues
“Cure for job boredom:
I made my favorite
pastime my career!”
Richard Bertram, President
Bertram Yacht Co., Division of Nautec Corp.
“When you stop to think what percent of our total waking
hours is spent bread-winning, you realize how tragic it is
for any man to work at an occupation he doesn’t enjoy.
Besides frittering away life, it reduces chances of success
to just about zero. I know... because it almost happened
to me!
After college, I did what I thought was expected of me
and joined a solid, Manhattan-based insurance firm. I
soon found office routine wasn’t for me. I lived only for
lunch hour when I could walk to the Battery and mentally
sail with the ships that stood out in the Narrows . . . and
for the summer weekends when I could go sailing. Fortu
nately, the company I worked for is one of the leading
insurers of yachts and after two years I was transferred
to their Yacht Underwriting Department. Enjoyment and
interest in my work improved immediately 100%.
