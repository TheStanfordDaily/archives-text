# Army Resumes Autobahn Patrol

### 
BERLIN (UPl)—United States
Army jeeps have again begun pa
trolling the highway between Ber
lin and West Germany to protect
American travelers from Com
munist police, it was disclosed yes
terday.
Re-introduction of the post
blockade “courtesy patrols” was
seen here as one more symbol of
U.S. determination to hold all its
four-power rights in the divided
city. The patrols w'crc dropped 10
years ago but resumed because of
recent interference with U.S. mili
tary traffic.
West Berliners, on their Sunday
day off, meanwhile watched bit
terly but helplessly as East Berlin
police and Communist youth
“moving teams” began clearing
out another series of apartment
blocks along the East-West border.
