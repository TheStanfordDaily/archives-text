WASHINGTON (UPI» Atty.
Gen. Robert F. Kennedy said yes
terday the President is prepared
to use U.S. nuclear weapons in de
fending West Berlin against any
Communist move if such a step is
necessary.
The President’s brother also de
clared that the Western Allies had
reached agreement as to the cir
cumstances under which the
weapons would be employed. He
said there were other agreements
to deal with other contingencies.
The Attorney General’s state
ment came as Senate Democratic
leader Mike Mansfield, Mont., said
certain issues in the Berlin crisis
can be negotiated with Russia and
that de facto recognition of the
East German Communists might
well be inevitable.
MANSFIELD, basing his state
ment on “what I read, not what I
hear,” concluded that limited rec
ognition of East Germany “is be
ing considered at the present
time.” He mentioned the issue in
discussing possible points of ne
gotiation with the Soviets.
Kennedy, appearing on a tele
vision program (Meet the Press-
NBC), was asked about a Senate
speech last week by Sen. Margaret
Chase Smith, R-Maine. She said
she feared the buildup of U.S.
conventional forces had given
Prussia the idea this country would
not use its nuclear weapons.
Kennedy said the President was
prepared to draw on America’s
atomic arms “if it comes to that.”
He also said he hoped that Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev had
become convinced of the Presi
dent’s determination within the
past few weeks.
THE ATTORNEY General said
the United States had built up
conventional forces in the face of
the Berlin crisis because it want
ed to have a “third alternative”
besides a peaceful solution of the
problem and a nuclear war that
might wipe out most of humanity.
He foresaw the possibility of a
situation developing in which con
ventional forces would be called
into play. In any case, he said,
“The President is going to stand
up” to Russia in any showdown.
Mansfield, in making his state
ment. apparently anticipated an
gry West German outcries against,
any form of recognition for the
German Communist government.
He reminded the West Germans
that they already recognize East
Germany “to the tune of over $3OO
million a year” in economic agree
ments.
