## Germany Won't Reunite In Foreseeable Future 
### 
Since Vienna there have been
many statements about Berlin
from both sides of the Iron Cur
tain. They are significant for what
they do say. They are no less sig
nificant for what they do not say.
Each side has said what is the
vital interest which it will fight
for rather than surrender. The
West has made it unmistakably
clear that it will fight for, rather
than surrender, the freedom of
West Berlin and freedom of access
to West Berlin.
The Soviet government has
made it very clear that it will sign
a peace treaty with East Germany
and it argues from it all the legal
consequences.
BUT THE West has not said it
will refuse to discuss the guaran
tees of the freedom of West Ber
lin. And the Soviet government
has not said that it will support
the East German government in
a blockade or in the occupation
of West Berlin.
Thus far, both sides have been
both firm and cautious, vehement
that they will not surrender their
vital interests and careful not to
close the doors to negotiations.
The doors would be closed if
Khrushchev declared that the Al
lies must evacuate West Berlin.
THE doors would be closed if
we refused to discuss West Berlin.
But these doors, which are the
critical ones, have not been closed.
That is what Mayor Willy Brandt
of West Berlin seems to have
meant when he said the other day
that the situation is very danger
ous but that it may not be as dra
matic as some suppose.
The basic American position
has always been that the problem
of Berlin can be solved definitive
ly only if the West Germans are
reunited and the whole of Berlin
becomes the capital of Germany.
Then there would be no prob
lem of access because the roads,
the canals, and the airlanes would
all be inside of one Germany.
There would be no problem of
freedom because all the Berliners
would have the same rights as all
the other Germans.
But, unhappily, there is no vis
ible chance of reuniting the two
Germanys. They have been divid
ed for 15 years, and in that time
almost all of Europe on both sides
of the Iron Curtain has acquired
vested interests which oppose the
reunion of Germany.
THERE ABE, of course, the
Soviet Union and all its satellites,
especially Poland and Czechoslo
vakia, which would regard one
Germany of 80 million people,
armed by and allied with the Unit
ed States, as a mortal danger.
But they are not alone.
The truth is that France and
Britain are decided as a matter of

undeclared national policy to pre
vent the unification of the twp
Germanys. The flourishing idea
of “European unity’’ has been one
of its cardinal purposes the ce
menting of West Germany into
Western Europe in order to obvi
ate the danger of an independent,
united, armed, and venturesome
Germany.
BECAUSE the Soviet Union will
not permit the reunification of
Germany, because it has in this
the unavowed support of almost
all of Western Europe, including
a very large section of the West
ern Germans, there is no prospect
of solving the Berlin problem ac
cording to the classic American
formula.
This is the setting in which the
problem of West Berlin is posted
today. There are some who say
that there would be no problem if
Khrushchev had not deliberately
and unnecessarily created one. I
am afraid they have not fully un
derstood the problem.
For while the Communists do
not like the status quo in Berlin
showplace, propaganda, espion
age, and escape hatch the West
also has a good deal to worry
about.
I shall cite as a witness the
German Ambassador to Washing
ton, Dr. Wilhelm Grewe, quoting
from his official commentary on
the Geneva conference of 1959.
AFTER ARGUING that no ne
gotiated compromise is possible,
Dr. Grewe says, “At most, the
only conceivable thing would be a
silent agreement which would let
the other partner know the situ
ation is accepted as irrevocable in
Berlin, on the one hand (by con
tinued presence of Western
troops), and in the Soviet Zone, on
the other (by continued existence
of the Ulbricht regime).”
This is the preservation of the
status quo, which so many tell us
should be our objective.
But what does the German Am
bassador say about this objective?
"If the West would acquiesce,
then this too would not be a true
compromise but rather the begin
ning of a capitulation.
“West Berlin cannot, in the long
run, be held if its population must
come to the conclusion that the
West has in fact accepted the di
vision of Germany.”
THAT LAST cuts to the heart
of the issue.
West Berlin, says the German
Ambassador, cannot in the long
run be held if the people come to
believe that the West has accepted
the division of Germany.
Why not? Presumably because
many of the Berliners will move
to the West and other will make
their way to the East. It is this
recognition of the division of Ger
many that Khrushchev has as his
primary object.
The Ambassador may be right,
and if all we can do is to stand
firm and stand fast, almost surely
the Ambassador’s pessimism will
prove to have been right.
But there is no compelling rea
son why we should accept so des
perate a conclusion. For if the
German Ambassador is right, we
are risking a thermonuclear war
to preserve a situation in which
“West Berlin cannot in the long
run be held.”
IT WOULD BE a wiser policy,
it seems to me, to recognize the
fact that for the indefinite future
the two Germanys will not re
unite, and to insist as a matter of
positive Western policy, not as a
shamefaced concession to the Sov
iets, our new guarantees to meet
this new situation, guarantees
under which West Berlin can live
confidently and in freedom until
the day, now so remote, when it
will again be the capital of Ger
many.
I am convinced that the failure
by the President to take such a
positive line will mean that he has
surrendered the initiative in Ger
man affairs to Khrushchev. If
there is nothing he want to do in
Germany except to do nothing,
the President will have lost the
power to direct and control the
struggle, and to use force and the
threat of force intelligently to
achieve real results.

Since Vienna there have been
many statements about Berlin
from both sides of the Iron Cur
tain. They are significant for what
they do say. They are no less sig
nificant for what they do not say.
Each side has said what is the
vital interest which it will fight
for rather than surrender. The
West has made it unmistakably
clear that it will fight for, rather
than surrender, the freedom of
West Berlin and freedom of access
to West Berlin.
The Soviet government has
made it very clear that it will sign
a peace treaty with East Germany
and it argues from it all the legal
consequences.
BUT THE West has not said it
will refuse to discuss the guaran
tees of the freedom of West Ber
lin. And the Soviet government
has not said that it will support
the East German government in
a blockade or in the occupation
of West Berlin.
Thus far, both sides have been
both firm and cautious, vehement
that they will not surrender their
vital interests and careful not to
close the doors to negotiations.
The doors would be closed if
Khrushchev declared that the Al
lies must evacuate West Berlin.
THE doors would be closed if
we refused to discuss West Berlin.
But these doors, which are the
critical ones, have not been closed.
That is what Mayor Willy Brandt
of West Berlin seems to have
meant when he said the other day
that the situation is very danger
ous but that it may not be as dra
matic as some suppose.
The basic American position
has always been that the problem
of Berlin can be solved definitive
ly only if the West Germans are
reunited and the whole of Berlin
becomes the capital of Germany.
Then there would be no prob
lem of access because the roads,
the canals, and the airlanes would
all be inside of one Germany.
There would be no problem of
freedom because all the Berliners
would have the same rights as all
the other Germans.
But, unhappily, there is no vis
ible chance of reuniting the two
Germanys. They have been divid
ed for 15 years, and in that time
almost all of Europe on both sides
of the Iron Curtain has acquired
vested interests which oppose the
reunion of Germany.
THERE ABE, of course, the
Soviet Union and all its satellites,
especially Poland and Czechoslo
vakia, which would regard one
Germany of 80 million people,
armed by and allied with the Unit
ed States, as a mortal danger.
But they are not alone.
The truth is that France and
Britain are decided as a matter of

undeclared national policy to pre
vent the unification of the twp
Germanys. The flourishing idea
of “European unity’’ has been one
of its cardinal purposes the ce
menting of West Germany into
Western Europe in order to obvi
ate the danger of an independent,
united, armed, and venturesome
Germany.
BECAUSE the Soviet Union will
not permit the reunification of
Germany, because it has in this
the unavowed support of almost
all of Western Europe, including
a very large section of the West
ern Germans, there is no prospect
of solving the Berlin problem ac
cording to the classic American
formula.
This is the setting in which the
problem of West Berlin is posted
today. There are some who say
that there would be no problem if
Khrushchev had not deliberately
and unnecessarily created one. I
am afraid they have not fully un
derstood the problem.
For while the Communists do
not like the status quo in Berlin
showplace, propaganda, espion
age, and escape hatch the West
also has a good deal to worry
about.
I shall cite as a witness the
German Ambassador to Washing
ton, Dr. Wilhelm Grewe, quoting
from his official commentary on
the Geneva conference of 1959.
AFTER ARGUING that no ne
gotiated compromise is possible,
Dr. Grewe says, “At most, the
only conceivable thing would be a
silent agreement which would let
the other partner know the situ
ation is accepted as irrevocable in
Berlin, on the one hand (by con
tinued presence of Western
troops), and in the Soviet Zone, on
the other (by continued existence
of the Ulbricht regime).”
This is the preservation of the
status quo, which so many tell us
should be our objective.
But what does the German Am
bassador say about this objective?
"If the West would acquiesce,
then this too would not be a true
compromise but rather the begin
ning of a capitulation.
“West Berlin cannot, in the long
run, be held if its population must
come to the conclusion that the
West has in fact accepted the di
vision of Germany.”
THAT LAST cuts to the heart
of the issue.
West Berlin, says the German
Ambassador, cannot in the long
run be held if the people come to
believe that the West has accepted
the division of Germany.
Why not? Presumably because
many of the Berliners will move
to the West and other will make
their way to the East. It is this
recognition of the division of Ger
many that Khrushchev has as his
primary object.
The Ambassador may be right,
and if all we can do is to stand
firm and stand fast, almost surely
the Ambassador’s pessimism will
prove to have been right.
But there is no compelling rea
son why we should accept so des
perate a conclusion. For if the
German Ambassador is right, we
are risking a thermonuclear war
to preserve a situation in which
“West Berlin cannot in the long
run be held.”
IT WOULD BE a wiser policy,
it seems to me, to recognize the
fact that for the indefinite future
the two Germanys will not re
unite, and to insist as a matter of
positive Western policy, not as a
shamefaced concession to the Sov
iets, our new guarantees to meet
this new situation, guarantees
under which West Berlin can live
confidently and in freedom until
the day, now so remote, when it
will again be the capital of Ger
many.
I am convinced that the failure
by the President to take such a
positive line will mean that he has
surrendered the initiative in Ger
man affairs to Khrushchev. If
there is nothing he want to do in
Germany except to do nothing,
the President will have lost the
power to direct and control the
struggle, and to use force and the
threat of force intelligently to

the day, now so remote, when it

the President will have lost the

Since Vienna there have been
many statements about Berlin
from both sides of the Iron Cur
tain. They are significant for what
they do say. They are no less sig
nificant for what they do not say.
Each side has said what is the
vital interest which it will fight
for rather than surrender. The
West has made it unmistakably
clear that it will fight for, rather
than surrender, the freedom of
West Berlin and freedom of access
to West Berlin.
The Soviet government has
made it very clear that it will sign
a peace treaty with East Germany
and it argues from it all the legal
consequences.
BUT THE West has not said it
will refuse to discuss the guaran
tees of the freedom of West Ber
lin. And the Soviet government
has not said that it will support
the East German government in
a blockade or in the occupation
of West Berlin.
Thus far, both sides have been
both firm and cautious, vehement
that they will not surrender their
vital interests and careful not to
close the doors to negotiations.
The doors would be closed if
Khrushchev declared that the Al
lies must evacuate West Berlin.
THE doors would be closed if
we refused to discuss West Berlin.
But these doors, which are the
critical ones, have not been closed.
That is what Mayor Willy Brandt
of West Berlin seems to have
meant when he said the other day
that the situation is very danger
ous but that it may not be as dra
matic as some suppose.
The basic American position
has always been that the problem
of Berlin can be solved definitive
ly only if the West Germans are
reunited and the whole of Berlin
becomes the capital of Germany.
Then there would be no prob
lem of access because the roads,
the canals, and the airlanes would
all be inside of one Germany.
There would be no problem of
freedom because all the Berliners
would have the same rights as all
the other Germans.
But, unhappily, there is no vis
ible chance of reuniting the two
Germanys. They have been divid
ed for 15 years, and in that time
almost all of Europe on both sides
of the Iron Curtain has acquired
vested interests which oppose the
reunion of Germany.
THERE ABE, of course, the
Soviet Union and all its satellites,
especially Poland and Czechoslo
vakia, which would regard one
Germany of 80 million people,
armed by and allied with the Unit
ed States, as a mortal danger.
But they are not alone.
The truth is that France and
Britain are decided as a matter of

undeclared national policy to pre
vent the unification of the twp
Germanys. The flourishing idea
of “European unity’’ has been one
of its cardinal purposes the ce
menting of West Germany into
Western Europe in order to obvi
ate the danger of an independent,
united, armed, and venturesome
Germany.
BECAUSE the Soviet Union will
not permit the reunification of
Germany, because it has in this
the unavowed support of almost
all of Western Europe, including
a very large section of the West
ern Germans, there is no prospect
of solving the Berlin problem ac
cording to the classic American
formula.
This is the setting in which the
problem of West Berlin is posted
today. There are some who say
that there would be no problem if
Khrushchev had not deliberately
and unnecessarily created one. I
am afraid they have not fully un
derstood the problem.
For while the Communists do
not like the status quo in Berlin
showplace, propaganda, espion
age, and escape hatch the West
also has a good deal to worry
about.
I shall cite as a witness the
German Ambassador to Washing
ton, Dr. Wilhelm Grewe, quoting
from his official commentary on
the Geneva conference of 1959.
AFTER ARGUING that no ne
gotiated compromise is possible,
Dr. Grewe says, “At most, the
only conceivable thing would be a
silent agreement which would let
the other partner know the situ
ation is accepted as irrevocable in
Berlin, on the one hand (by con
tinued presence of Western
troops), and in the Soviet Zone, on
the other (by continued existence
of the Ulbricht regime).”
This is the preservation of the
status quo, which so many tell us
should be our objective.
But what does the German Am
bassador say about this objective?
"If the West would acquiesce,
then this too would not be a true
compromise but rather the begin
ning of a capitulation.
“West Berlin cannot, in the long
run, be held if its population must
come to the conclusion that the
West has in fact accepted the di
vision of Germany.”
THAT LAST cuts to the heart
of the issue.
West Berlin, says the German
Ambassador, cannot in the long
run be held if the people come to
believe that the West has accepted
the division of Germany.
Why not? Presumably because
many of the Berliners will move
to the West and other will make
their way to the East. It is this
recognition of the division of Ger
many that Khrushchev has as his
primary object.
The Ambassador may be right,
and if all we can do is to stand
firm and stand fast, almost surely
the Ambassador’s pessimism will
prove to have been right.
But there is no compelling rea
son why we should accept so des
perate a conclusion. For if the
German Ambassador is right, we
are risking a thermonuclear war
to preserve a situation in which
“West Berlin cannot in the long
run be held.”
IT WOULD BE a wiser policy,
it seems to me, to recognize the
fact that for the indefinite future
the two Germanys will not re
unite, and to insist as a matter of
positive Western policy, not as a
shamefaced concession to the Sov
iets, our new guarantees to meet
this new situation, guarantees
under which West Berlin can live
confidently and in freedom until
the day, now so remote, when it
will again be the capital of Ger
many.
I am convinced that the failure
by the President to take such a
positive line will mean that he has

man affairs to Khrushchev. If

it seems to me, to recognize the
fact that for the indefinite future
the two Germanys will not re
unite, and to insist as a matter of
positive Western policy, not as a
shamefaced concession to the Sov
iets, our new guarantees to meet
this new situation, guarantees
under which West Berlin can live
confidently and in freedom until
the day, now so remote, when it
will again be the capital of Ger
many.
I am convinced that the failure
by the President to take such a
positive line will mean that he has
surrendered the initiative in Ger
man affairs to Khrushchev. If
there is nothing he want to do in
Germany except to do nothing,
the President will have lost the
power to direct and control the
struggle, and to use force and the
threat of force intelligently to
achieve real results.

Since Vienna there have been
many statements about Berlin
from both sides of the Iron Cur
tain. They are significant for what
they do say. They are no less sig
nificant for what they do not say.
Each side has said what is the
vital interest which it will fight
for rather than surrender. The
West has made it unmistakably
clear that it will fight for, rather
than surrender, the freedom of
West Berlin and freedom of access
to West Berlin.
The Soviet government has
made it very clear that it will sign
a peace treaty with East Germany
and it argues from it all the legal
consequences.
BUT THE West has not said it
will refuse to discuss the guaran
tees of the freedom of West Ber
lin. And the Soviet government
has not said that it will support
the East German government in
a blockade or in the occupation
of West Berlin.
Thus far, both sides have been
both firm and cautious, vehement
that they will not surrender their
vital interests and careful not to
close the doors to negotiations.
The doors would be closed if
Khrushchev declared that the Al
lies must evacuate West Berlin.
THE doors would be closed if
we refused to discuss West Berlin.
But these doors, which are the
critical ones, have not been closed.
That is what Mayor Willy Brandt
of West Berlin seems to have
meant when he said the other day
that the situation is very danger
ous but that it may not be as dra
matic as some suppose.
The basic American position
has always been that the problem
of Berlin can be solved definitive
ly only if the West Germans are
reunited and the whole of Berlin
becomes the capital of Germany.
Then there would be no prob
lem of access because the roads,
the canals, and the airlanes would
all be inside of one Germany.
There would be no problem of
freedom because all the Berliners
would have the same rights as all
the other Germans.
But, unhappily, there is no vis
ible chance of reuniting the two
Germanys. They have been divid
ed for 15 years, and in that time
almost all of Europe on both sides
of the Iron Curtain has acquired
vested interests which oppose the
reunion of Germany.
THERE ABE, of course, the
Soviet Union and all its satellites,
especially Poland and Czechoslo
vakia, which would regard one
Germany of 80 million people,
armed by and allied with the Unit
ed States, as a mortal danger.
But they are not alone.
The truth is that France and
Britain are decided as a matter of

undeclared national policy to pre
vent the unification of the twp
Germanys. The flourishing idea
of “European unity’’ has been one
of its cardinal purposes the ce
menting of West Germany into
Western Europe in order to obvi
ate the danger of an independent,
united, armed, and venturesome
Germany.
BECAUSE the Soviet Union will
not permit the reunification of
Germany, because it has in this
the unavowed support of almost
all of Western Europe, including
a very large section of the West
ern Germans, there is no prospect
of solving the Berlin problem ac
cording to the classic American
formula.
This is the setting in which the
problem of West Berlin is posted
today. There are some who say
that there would be no problem if
Khrushchev had not deliberately
and unnecessarily created one. I
am afraid they have not fully un
derstood the problem.
For while the Communists do
not like the status quo in Berlin
showplace, propaganda, espion
age, and escape hatch the West
also has a good deal to worry
about.
I shall cite as a witness the
German Ambassador to Washing
ton, Dr. Wilhelm Grewe, quoting
from his official commentary on
the Geneva conference of 1959.
AFTER ARGUING that no ne
gotiated compromise is possible,
Dr. Grewe says, “At most, the
only conceivable thing would be a
silent agreement which would let
the other partner know the situ
ation is accepted as irrevocable in
Berlin, on the one hand (by con
tinued presence of Western
troops), and in the Soviet Zone, on
the other (by continued existence
of the Ulbricht regime).”
This is the preservation of the
status quo, which so many tell us
should be our objective.
But what does the German Am
bassador say about this objective?
"If the West would acquiesce,
then this too would not be a true
compromise but rather the begin
ning of a capitulation.
“West Berlin cannot, in the long
run, be held if its population must
come to the conclusion that the
West has in fact accepted the di
vision of Germany.”
THAT LAST cuts to the heart
of the issue.
West Berlin, says the German
Ambassador, cannot in the long
run be held if the people come to
believe that the West has accepted
the division of Germany.
Why not? Presumably because
many of the Berliners will move
to the West and other will make
their way to the East. It is this
recognition of the division of Ger
many that Khrushchev has as his
primary object.
The Ambassador may be right,
and if all we can do is to stand
firm and stand fast, almost surely
the Ambassador’s pessimism will
prove to have been right.
But there is no compelling rea
son why we should accept so des
perate a conclusion. For if the
German Ambassador is right, we
are risking a thermonuclear war
to preserve a situation in which
“West Berlin cannot in the long
run be held.”
IT WOULD BE a wiser policy,
it seems to me, to recognize the
fact that for the indefinite future
the two Germanys will not re
unite, and to insist as a matter of
positive Western policy, not as a
shamefaced concession to the Sov
iets, our new guarantees to meet
this new situation, guarantees
under which West Berlin can live
confidently and in freedom until
the day, now so remote, when it
will again be the capital of Ger
many.
I am convinced that the failure
by the President to take such a
positive line will mean that he has
surrendered the initiative in Ger
man affairs to Khrushchev. If
there is nothing he want to do in
Germany except to do nothing,
the President will have lost the
power to direct and control the
struggle, and to use force and the
threat of force intelligently to
achieve real results.
