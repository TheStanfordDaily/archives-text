SALISBURY, Rhodesia (UPI)
—The United Nations intelligence
chief in Katanga said yesterday
that sabotage can be “99 per cent
ruled out” in the plane crash that
killed U.N. Secretary General Dag
Hammarskjold.
Despite the statement by Nor
wegian Lt. Col. Bjorn Egge, some
African nationalist leaders still
blamed “Western imperialists” for
the disaster.
In Cairo, United Arab Republic
President Gamal Abdel Nasser
sent a message to U.N. General
Assembly President Mongl Slim
demanding an investigation into
the crash.
