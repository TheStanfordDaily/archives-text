WEST GERMANY—The most
important question in West Ger
many today, “Who will be chan
cellor?” could have had during
the last 12 years only one answer,
Konrad Adenauer.
However, the present chancel
lor, who has almost dictatorially
controlled his party and the coun
try since the first federal election
in 1949, is in danger of losing his
job to the man who he said in
1959 was not fit to be his succes
sor Ludwig Erhard, the present
economics minister and member
of the CSU, the Bavarian branch
of Adenauer’s CDU party.
As is old news by now, the
CDU/CSU lost its majority in the
Bundestag, the German upper
house, in the Sept. 17 federal elec
tion, while the SPD, Berlin Mayor
Willy Brandt’s party, and the
FDP made impressive gains.
BUT THE effects of these
changes have not yet been mani
fested, and the German political
situation is unsettled at the most
critical period of post-war history.
With less than 50 per cent of the
representation in the Bundestag,
which selects the chancellor, the
CDU/CSU must turn to a coali
tion in order to lead an effective
government.
The odds-on choice for a coali
tion partner is the FDP (Free
Democrats Party) which has
jumped from 7.7 per cent of the
vote in 1957 to an amazing 12.7
per cent in this election.
HOWEVER, the FDP leader,
Erich Mende, has vociferously
ruled out any coalition with Ade
nauer as chancellor, although
agreeing to a joint government
with Erhard. Adenauer, on the
other hand, has just as vociferous
ly made known he is not ready to
retire, and there are no indications'
his party is prepared to abandon
him.
It is possible that the 85-year
old Adenauer, known by friends
and enemies as Der Alte (the old
one), can remain chancellor with
out a parliamentary majority; for
the German Basic Law permits
the party with a plurality, in this
case the CDU/CSU, to select the

chancellor if a majority cannot
be raised.
However, such a government
would have to depend, without
any real assurance of effective
control, upon the day-to-day
moods of the other parties to push
its program through; and Ger
many cannot afford instability un
der present conditions.
IN SPITE OF Der Alte’s efforts
to keep the status quo in West
German politics, it is evident from
the election that changes must oc
cur, changes which will not alter
the Federal Republic’s domestic
and foreign policies, but which
will nonetheless bo the end of the
“Adenauer era” and the CDU/CSU
monopoly of government.
The reasons for the CDU/CSU
backslide are varied, but much of
the blame must lie with the party
and its leader.
Adenauer refused during the
course of the campaign to desig
nate who his successor might be
and when he would step down.
Even CDU/CSU adherents admit
this attitude was a detriment.
THE AGE of Der Alte was cer
tainly an important consideration
to many voters, particularly in
view of his adamant refusal to
think of retirement.
Adenauer’s failure to fly to Ber
lin until 10 days after the Aug. 13
blockade and the favorable pub
licity for Brandt, as West Berlin’s
mayor, surely affected the vote.
AND THE PARTY hurt its
chances by showing a lack of self
confidence and an overabundance
of confusion and discord in the
pre-election period.
The bitterest campaign in post
war West Germany also contribut
ed to the party’s losses. Although
mud-slinging was practiced by
both major parties, the CDU/CSU
dirtied its hands the most, particu
larly among the top leaders.
The SPD was not innocent of
defamation, but such comments
were on the whole absent in
Brandt’s speeches, and the voter
noticed the difference.
BUT the most interesting and
politically most important result
of the election was the gain made
by the FDP, which now holds the
balance of power.
The FDP is in reality an unusu
al political party with virtually
no platform and a variety of po
litical elements.
Its main appeal was as a solu
tion for those voters who couldn’t
make up their minds between the

CDU/CSU and the SPD, or who
did not want to vote for either.
IN SPITE OF the CDU/CSU’s
slogan of “Success and Experi
ence” reflecting the prosperity
and peace of its rule, or the SPD’s
promises of a more active govern
ment and a better life, large num
bers of voters selected the third
party, the FDP, which promised
little more than an end to the
CDU/CSU’s and Adenauer’s mon
opoly.
For those who believe that the
German people are still politically
naive, the election may be an eye
opener.
Ignoring the financial, foreign
and social success of the present
government and the political max
im of not changing horses in the
middle of a dangerous stream,
many German voters realized that
it is unwise and perilous for one
party and one man to control a
government without fear of de
feat at the polls.
TO HAVE CHOSEN the SPD
also would have been a mistake
in view of the absence of capable
men in this party, its complete
lack of experience and its bum
bling efforts at opposition.
The next election may see the
dissolution of the SPD and the
formation of a new party which
has more appeal and more talent.
As for the immediate future, Er
hard has the mside track for the
office of chancellor under a CDU/
CSU and FDP coalition.
ALTHOUGH Der Alte may be
able to govern with a plurality
or to convince the FDP to accept
him for a short time, his political
days are limited, and the future
belongs to Erhard.
The domestic and foreign poli
cies of the last 12 years will not
be measurably altered, but ‘the
nature of the government will
nonetheless assume a new look.
The wisdom of the German
voters in making this choice will

be judged during the next four
years, and from all present ap
pearances the verdict will be fa
vorable.

GERMAN ELECTION MEETINGS LIVELY, BEER-FILLED
Picture above shows an election gathering in a Munich beer hall
before the Sept. 17 election. Rally is for the DFU (German Peace
Union) which is considered one of the leftist parties and somewhat
communistic. The German making his point is from the SPD and is
challenging the speaker. Picture at right shows the speaker, Richard
Vogel, replying. The poster behind him reads "In the spirit of Albert
Schweitzer" and "neutral, without atomic weapons." The DFU, plus
other small parties, failed to get the necessary five per cent of votes
cast to tak its seat in the Bundestag. Pictures were taken by Charles
Hansing, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and former
photo editor of the Daily Pennsylvanian. He is on a year's leave
of absence from Penn's medical school on an exchange scholarship
to the Free University of Berlin.
