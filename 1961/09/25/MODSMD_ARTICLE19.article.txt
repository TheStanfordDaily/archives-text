The meeting, at Adenauer’s in
vitation, touches off a week of in
tensive negotiations given a sense
of urgency by international ten
sions as well as domestic reper
cussions in the wake of election
losses by the Adenauer forces.
Uncertainty over the formation
of a new government has caused
trading on the major stock mar
kets to decrease and some ma jor
issues have recorded drops of up
to 5 per cent.
President Heinrich Luebke is

scheduled to confer with Adenau
er this week on the possibility for
a coalition between the Chancel
lor’s Christian Democrats and one
or both of the two other major
powers the Socialists and the
Free Democrats.
The Free Democrats (TOP)
which emerged from the elections
as the balance-of-power party,
were considered to be the likeli
est coalition partner for the Chris
tian Democrats.
