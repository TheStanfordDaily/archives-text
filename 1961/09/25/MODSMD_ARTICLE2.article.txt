### ROY SCHMIDT 
It took a third string quarter
back and second string halfback
to finally end Stanford’s eleven
game losing streak as the two
combined on a 47-yard pass play
that beat Tulane 9-7 Saturday.
The big play came with about
ten minutes remaining in the
game and Stanford trailing 7-3.
Chuck Butler, the third Indian
quarterback of the day launched
a drive from the Stanford 10-yard
line. With Larry Royse and Mike
Barnes ripping off big gains to the
outside and a pair of Butler
aerials to George Honore and
Royse the Indians steadily made
their way to the Tulane 47.
THEN BUTLER faked beauti
fully to fullback Tony DeLellis
going up the center and dropped
back to find Royse about eight
yards behind the nearest defend
er. The senior quarterback throw
a perfect strike which Royse took
and stumbled into the end zone.
Just moments before, Butler
had called the same pattern but
gave to the fullback who picked
up four yards and a first down.
Butler’s fake the second time
around was superb and sucked the
Tulane defense up to meet the
charging DeLelli-s.
For Stanford it meant the end
of a long dry spell which began
November 14, 1959 when the
Cards last outscored an opponent
Oregon State 39-22.
FOR COACH Jack Curtice

years that he cracked a smile and
also the first that he didn’t have
to watch (he demoralizing fizz of
those two Alka Seltzer tablets in
water.
The Indians, depending heavily
on (he 37 sophomores that suited
up, put together a stubborn de
fense that held (he more experi
enced Tulane outfit to just 121

yards on the ground and 24
through the air.
The hard charging Stanford
line continually harassed Tulane
quarterbacks Ted Miller and A1
Burgueries and allowed them to
complete only one in nine at
tempts. C. B. Simons, Randy Va
han, Frank Atkinson and George
Honore kept the pressure on and
several times dropped the Tulane
passers for big losses.
Linebackers Hal Steuber and
Gary Craig kept the middle bot

tled up and effectively checked the
Green Wave short passing game.
GORDON RUSH, the outstand
ing Tulane halfback who was ex
pected to pick up where Tommy
Mason left off last year, was easi
ly contained by the spirited In
dians. He was held to a net gain of
just two yards in the first half and
managed only 15 more in the sec
ond period.
Both teams played it safe in the
opening quarter, sticking primari-
