# Butler, Royse Spark Stanford To First Victory in Two Years
## 
### ROY SCHMIDT 
It took a third string quarter
back and second string halfback
to finally end Stanford’s eleven
game losing streak as the two
combined on a 47-yard pass play
that beat Tulane 9-7 Saturday.
The big play came with about
ten minutes remaining in the
game and Stanford trailing 7-3.
Chuck Butler, the third Indian
quarterback of the day launched
a drive from the Stanford 10-yard
line. With Larry Royse and Mike
Barnes ripping off big gains to the
outside and a pair of Butler
aerials to George Honore and
Royse the Indians steadily made
their way to the Tulane 47.
THEN BUTLER faked beauti
fully to fullback Tony DeLellis
going up the center and dropped
back to find Royse about eight
yards behind the nearest defend
er. The senior quarterback throw
a perfect strike which Royse took
and stumbled into the end zone.
Just moments before, Butler
had called the same pattern but
gave to the fullback who picked
up four yards and a first down.
Butler’s fake the second time
around was superb and sucked the
Tulane defense up to meet the
charging DeLelli-s.
For Stanford it meant the end
of a long dry spell which began
November 14, 1959 when the
Cards last outscored an opponent
Oregon State 39-22.
FOR COACH Jack Curtice
it was the first Saturday in two
years that he cracked a smile and
also the first that he didn’t have
to watch (he demoralizing fizz of
those two Alka Seltzer tablets in
water.
The Indians, depending heavily
on (he 37 sophomores that suited
up, put together a stubborn de
fense that held (he more experi
enced Tulane outfit to just 121

yards on the ground and 24
through the air.
The hard charging Stanford
line continually harassed Tulane
quarterbacks Ted Miller and A1
Burgueries and allowed them to
complete only one in nine at
tempts. C. B. Simons, Randy Va
han, Frank Atkinson and George
Honore kept the pressure on and
several times dropped the Tulane
passers for big losses.
Linebackers Hal Steuber and
Gary Craig kept the middle bot

tled up and effectively checked the
Green Wave short passing game.
GORDON RUSH, the outstand
ing Tulane halfback who was ex
pected to pick up where Tommy
Mason left off last year, was easi
ly contained by the spirited In
dians. He was held to a net gain of
just two yards in the first half and
managed only 15 more in the sec
ond period.
Both teams played it safe in the
opening quarter, sticking primari-

Young quarterback converts same play that spelled victory a little later
ly to the ground. But as the sec
ond period began, Craig got off a
52-yard boot to the Tulane four.
The Green Wave wanted no part
of it that deep in (heir own terri
tory and kicked out, on second
down. Then Rod Sears, the Cards’
number one quarterback, began
to move the club.
With Craig picking up good
yardage to the outside and Sears
and end Steve Pursell connecting
on a couple of passes, the Indians
reached the Tulane 11. There the
offensive trogged down and Stan
Lindskog was called on for a field
goal attempt. His 29-yard shot
was true and Stanford left the
field at the half with a scant 3-0
yead.
TULANE capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble late in the third quar
ter for its only score. After ex
changing punts with the Indians’
Craig, Rush finally dropped one
on the Stanford three-yard line.
When two running plays into
the center of the line failed, sopho
more quarterback Steve Thurlow
pitched low to Mike Barnes going
outside and the ball was recovered
by Tom Cato for the Green Wave
just two yards shy of paydirt.
Fullback Lenny Stein converted
it in two tries; it looked like a re
peat performance for the Indians
until Royse and Butler got to
gether.
ROYSE, A senior, started be
hind Craig at left half, but finish
ed as the offensive star of the ball
game. He picked up 47 yards in
eight carries on the ground and
caught four passes for 73 more.
A number of the sophomores
that Curtice was banking on came
through with outstanding per
formances. Thurlow, who has
caught the eye of many of the so
called experts, showed well at
quarterback. Except for his near
disastrous fumble on the Stanford
goal line, the young quarterback
showed poise and finesse, com
pleting three of four passes for 62
yards. This, combined with a mi

nus six on the ground, gave him
56 for total offense honors.
Mike Barnes, another promising
sophomore, stood out in the back
field and was praised by Curtice
after the game. He led all Stan
ford ball carriers with 50 yards
in eight carries including a couple
of long spurts in the final quarter.

The Tulane offense just never
got moving. Quarterback Miller
led the team in total offense with
47 yards. 24 of which came on the
Green Wave’s only completed
pass. Coach Andy Pilney was dis
satisfied with the blocking and
thought the team was sluggish on
both offense and defense.

The Green Wave wanted no part
of it that deep in (heir own terri

down. Then Rod Sears, the Cards’
number one quarterback, began
to move the club.
With Craig picking up good
yardage to the outside and Sears
and end Steve Pursell connecting
on a couple of passes, the Indians
reached the Tulane 11. There the
offensive trogged down and Stan
Lindskog was called on for a field
goal attempt. His 29-yard shot
was true and Stanford left the
field at the half with a scant 3-0
yead.
TULANE capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble late in the third quar
ter for its only score. After ex
changing punts with the Indians’
Craig, Rush finally dropped one
on the Stanford three-yard line.
When two running plays into
the center of the line failed, sopho
more quarterback Steve Thurlow
pitched low to Mike Barnes going
outside and the ball was recovered
by Tom Cato for the Green Wave
just two yards shy of paydirt.
Fullback Lenny Stein converted
it in two tries; it looked like a re

until Royse and Butler got to
gether.
ROYSE, A senior, started be
hind Craig at left half, but finish
ed as the offensive star of the ball
game. He picked up 47 yards in
eight carries on the ground and
caught four passes for 73 more.
A number of the sophomores
that Curtice was banking on came
through with outstanding per
formances. Thurlow, who has
caught the eye of many of the so
called experts, showed well at
quarterback. Except for his near
disastrous fumble on the Stanford
goal line, the young quarterback
showed poise and finesse, com
pleting three of four passes for 62
yards. This, combined with a mi

nus six on the ground, gave him
56 for total offense honors.
Mike Barnes, another promising
sophomore, stood out in the back
field and was praised by Curtice
after the game. He led all Stan
ford ball carriers with 50 yards
in eight carries including a couple
of long spurts in the final quarter.

The Tulane offense just never
got moving. Quarterback Miller
led the team in total offense with
47 yards. 24 of which came on the
Green Wave’s only completed
pass. Coach Andy Pilney was dis
satisfied with the blocking and
thought the team was sluggish on
both offense and defense.

It took a third string quarter
back and second string halfback
to finally end Stanford’s eleven

combined on a 47-yard pass play
that beat Tulane 9-7 Saturday.
The big play came with about
ten minutes remaining in the
game and Stanford trailing 7-3.
Chuck Butler, the third Indian
quarterback of the day launched
a drive from the Stanford 10-yard
line. With Larry Royse and Mike
Barnes ripping off big gains to the
outside and a pair of Butler
aerials to George Honore and
Royse the Indians steadily made
their way to the Tulane 47.
THEN BUTLER faked beauti
fully to fullback Tony DeLellis
going up the center and dropped
back to find Royse about eight
yards behind the nearest defend
er. The senior quarterback throw
a perfect strike which Royse took
and stumbled into the end zone.
Just moments before, Butler
had called the same pattern but
gave to the fullback who picked
up four yards and a first down.
Butler’s fake the second time
around was superb and sucked the
Tulane defense up to meet the
charging DeLelli-s.
For Stanford it meant the end
of a long dry spell which began
November 14, 1959 when the
Cards last outscored an opponent
Oregon State 39-22.
FOR COACH Jack Curtice
it was the first Saturday in two
years that he cracked a smile and
also the first that he didn’t have
to watch (he demoralizing fizz of
those two Alka Seltzer tablets in
water.
The Indians, depending heavily
on (he 37 sophomores that suited
up, put together a stubborn de
fense that held (he more experi
enced Tulane outfit to just 121

yards on the ground and 24
through the air.
The hard charging Stanford
line continually harassed Tulane
quarterbacks Ted Miller and A1
Burgueries and allowed them to
complete only one in nine at
tempts. C. B. Simons, Randy Va
han, Frank Atkinson and George
Honore kept the pressure on and
several times dropped the Tulane
passers for big losses.
Linebackers Hal Steuber and
Gary Craig kept the middle bot

tled up and effectively checked the
Green Wave short passing game.
GORDON RUSH, the outstand
ing Tulane halfback who was ex
pected to pick up where Tommy
Mason left off last year, was easi

dians. He was held to a net gain of
just two yards in the first half and
managed only 15 more in the sec

Both teams played it safe in the
opening quarter, sticking primari-

The Green Wave wanted no part
of it that deep in (heir own terri
tory and kicked out, on second
down. Then Rod Sears, the Cards’
number one quarterback, began
to move the club.
With Craig picking up good
yardage to the outside and Sears
and end Steve Pursell connecting
on a couple of passes, the Indians
reached the Tulane 11. There the
offensive trogged down and Stan
Lindskog was called on for a field
goal attempt. His 29-yard shot
was true and Stanford left the
field at the half with a scant 3-0
yead.
TULANE capitalized on a Stan
ford fumble late in the third quar
ter for its only score. After ex
changing punts with the Indians’
Craig, Rush finally dropped one
on the Stanford three-yard line.
When two running plays into
the center of the line failed, sopho
more quarterback Steve Thurlow
pitched low to Mike Barnes going
outside and the ball was recovered
by Tom Cato for the Green Wave
just two yards shy of paydirt.
Fullback Lenny Stein converted
it in two tries; it looked like a re
peat performance for the Indians
until Royse and Butler got to
gether.
ROYSE, A senior, started be
hind Craig at left half, but finish
ed as the offensive star of the ball
game. He picked up 47 yards in
eight carries on the ground and
caught four passes for 73 more.
A number of the sophomores
that Curtice was banking on came
through with outstanding per
formances. Thurlow, who has
caught the eye of many of the so
called experts, showed well at
quarterback. Except for his near
disastrous fumble on the Stanford
goal line, the young quarterback
showed poise and finesse, com
pleting three of four passes for 62
yards. This, combined with a mi

nus six on the ground, gave him
56 for total offense honors.
Mike Barnes, another promising
sophomore, stood out in the back
field and was praised by Curtice
after the game. He led all Stan
ford ball carriers with 50 yards
in eight carries including a couple
of long spurts in the final quarter.

The Tulane offense just never
got moving. Quarterback Miller
led the team in total offense with
47 yards. 24 of which came on the
Green Wave’s only completed
pass. Coach Andy Pilney was dis
satisfied with the blocking and
thought the team was sluggish on
both offense and defense.
