# Curtice Given Game Ball
## Cactus Jack Plays New Role; Explains Game- Winning Play 
### 
It was a beaming Jack Curtice
who triumphantly held the game
ball after his Stanford Indians
edged Tulane 9-7 yesterday for
their first win in two years. Cur
tice, playing a rather unfamiliar
role, rambled on enthusiastically
about the surprise showing of the
Indian defense and the fine play
of several sophomores.
“We don’t take our hats off to
anybody,” he said, "We contained
a powerful football team. Tulane
had a good line, and don’t you for
get it.”
Cactus Jack let that cherished
ball out of his clutches only once
and then it was to diagram the
play that made the difference
a fake draw and long pass to the
right half. Third-string quarter
back Chuck Butler made it work
as he faked beautifully up the
center and then found second
string halfback Larry Royse all
alone for the 47-yard scoring play.
Curtice pointed out that just min
utes before the Indians had used
the same pattern with fullback
Tony DeLellis taking the handoff
and picking up a first down.
Royse later said that the Tulane
safety was looking for a down and
out pattern and was way out of
position. He pointed out that he
and quarterback Steve Thurlow
had converted on the same play in
the second quarter for 36 yards.
Curtice was impressed by the
running of Steuber, Royse, Mike
Barnes, and Tony DeLellis. “Steu
ber came through with those three
and four yard chunks on third
down, and that made a differ
ence.”

The Stanford ends George Hon
ore and Steve Pursell were singled
out by their coach for excellent

defensive play. The Stanford line
held Tulane to just seven first
downs and 145 yards in total of
fense. Curtice liked the work of
big Frank Atkinson, 239-pound
sophomore tackle who led a fierce
rush on both Tulane quarterbacks.
The spirited Indian defense allow
ed only one Tulane completion in
nine attempts.
‘‘And those sophomores, 37 of
them,” Curtice went on. “They
came through 100 per cent just
like I knew they would.”
Coach Andy Pilney of Tulane
was grim as he entered the silent
Green Wave locker room. “Our
defense was good overall, but we
just couldn’t move the ball.” Our
line wasn’t blocking and the whole
offense seemed sluggish.” Pilney
thought Rod Sears, Stanford’s
number one quarterback ran the
club very well and praised the
timely running of fullback Steu
ber.
“That long pass, . . . that was
the only time our defense let
down. Our safely man just wasn’t
around.”
Pilney thought the Stanford
ball club looked good particularly
the passing game. “Jack Curtice
has a real strong club and that
defense never stops hustling.”

Royse later said that the Tulane
safety was looking for a down and
out pattern and was way out of
position. He pointed out that he
and quarterback Steve Thurlow
had converted on the same play in
the second quarter for 36 yards.
Curtice was impressed by the
running of Steuber, Royse, Mike
Barnes, and Tony DeLellis. “Steu
ber came through with those three
and four yard chunks on third
down, and that made a differ
ence.”

The Stanford ends George Hon
ore and Steve Pursell were singled
out by their coach for excellent

defensive play. The Stanford line
held Tulane to just seven first
downs and 145 yards in total of
fense. Curtice liked the work of
big Frank Atkinson, 239-pound
sophomore tackle who led a fierce
rush on both Tulane quarterbacks.
The spirited Indian defense allow
ed only one Tulane completion in
nine attempts.
‘‘And those sophomores, 37 of
them,” Curtice went on. “They
came through 100 per cent just
like I knew they would.”
Coach Andy Pilney of Tulane
was grim as he entered the silent
Green Wave locker room. “Our
defense was good overall, but we
just couldn’t move the ball.” Our
line wasn’t blocking and the whole
offense seemed sluggish.” Pilney
thought Rod Sears, Stanford’s
number one quarterback ran the
club very well and praised the
timely running of fullback Steu
ber.
“That long pass, . . . that was
the only time our defense let
down. Our safely man just wasn’t
around.”
Pilney thought the Stanford
ball club looked good particularly
the passing game. “Jack Curtice
has a real strong club and that
defense never stops hustling.”


CURTICE TAKES OPPORTUNITY TO CHEER
Cactus Jack Curtice is a happy man as he joins the fans in celebra
tion of the first Stanford football victory in two years. Cards tri
umphed over Tulane 9-7 to end an eleven-game losing streak.
It was a beaming Jack Curtice
who triumphantly held the game
ball after his Stanford Indians
edged Tulane 9-7 yesterday for
their first win in two years. Cur
tice, playing a rather unfamiliar
role, rambled on enthusiastically
about the surprise showing of the
Indian defense and the fine play
of several sophomores.
“We don’t take our hats off to
anybody,” he said, "We contained
a powerful football team. Tulane
had a good line, and don’t you for
get it.”
Cactus Jack let that cherished
ball out of his clutches only once
and then it was to diagram the
play that made the difference
a fake draw and long pass to the
right half. Third-string quarter
back Chuck Butler made it work
as he faked beautifully up the
center and then found second
string halfback Larry Royse all
alone for the 47-yard scoring play.
Curtice pointed out that just min
utes before the Indians had used
the same pattern with fullback
Tony DeLellis taking the handoff
and picking up a first down.
