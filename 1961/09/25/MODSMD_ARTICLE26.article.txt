# Big Five Elevens Manhandled in Three of Four Intersectionals
## 
### 
Stanford’s four AAWU rivals
did not fare as well as the Indians
in weekend action, with only
UCLA managing to survive the in
vasion of the West Coast by teams
from the South, Southwest, and
Midwest.

Georgia Tech started things off
Friday night in the Coliseum,
striking for 24 points in the first
half and then coasting to a 27-7
triumph over Southern Cal’s not
so Thundering Herd. For the Ram
blin’ Wrecks it was their first trip
this far West since nipping Cal in
the 1929 Rose Bowl.
Texas continued the massacre
of the Coast elevens by mauling
Cal at Berkeley, 28 3. Only an ear
ly case of fumbleitis kept the
Longhorns from running up a
much higher score. For the hap
less Golden Bears it was the be
ginning of a long, possibly winless
season, for their schedule is one
of the toughest in history.
Up North, Washington’s Rose
Bowl champions were taking on
another Big Ten rival, Purdue, but
the Huskies quickly discovered

that too many of the stars from
last year’s squad had graduated.
The Boilermakers from Indiana
started fast and hung on for a
13-6 win,

It remained for UCLA, playing
in a steady rain in Denver, to
salvage some measure of Coast
pride. The Bruins, led by tailback
Bobby Smith’s 178 yards and three
touchdowns, brought the Air
Force Academy down to earth as
they ground out a 19-6 win.
