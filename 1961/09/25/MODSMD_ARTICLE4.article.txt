# 310,000 GO BACK TO WORK
## UAW Ends GM Strike; Threatens Ford Walkout 
### 
DETROIT (UPI) The United Auto Workers Union ended
the two-week-old General Motors strike last night but immediately
threatened another walkout-against Ford Motor Co.
The UAW’s executive board ordered all GM local unions on
strike to withdraw their picket lines at midnight and said all its

310,000 members at the world’s
largest manufacturer should re
port for work today.
Thus, the UAW officially closed
a strike which started Sept. 11
over local issues, once idled a
quarter million workers and
closed nearly 100 plants. But
nearly all the plants had settled
their disputes by the time the
board met.
At the same lime, the Union
authorized a strike against Ford
Motor Co. But sot no deadline
for a walkout there. UAW Presi
dent Walter P. Rout her planned
to be at Ford bargaining head
quarters today to work out an
agreement with the No. 2 auto
firm.
The board said only two GM
plants were still without local
agreements Fisher Body 23 in
Detroit and Fisher Assembly in
Atlanta, Ga. Two key plants,
Fisher Body in Pittsburgh and
Delco-Remy in Anderson, Ind.,
had reached agreement, the
Union said.
But John McCarrell, president
of the Pittsburgh plant, said, ‘‘Wo
haven’t settled yet.” Ho also said
his members had no instructions
to withdraw their picket lines.
He added, however, that ‘‘we are
going to have a contract” but
refused (o say when the agree
ment would be reached.
In a brief statement at 8:30
p.m. EST, five and a half hours
after the meeting started, the
Union said:
“The UAW international execu
tive board unanimously voted to
terminate the strike against GM
effective tonight and to instruct
all local Unions on strike to with
draw their pickets at that time.
“Workers who have not already
returned to work should do so
beginning with the first shift on
Monday, consistent with opera
tion needs.”

In a brief statement at 8:30
p.m. EST, five and a half hours
after the meeting started, the
Union said:
“The UAW international execu

terminate the strike against GM

all local Unions on strike to with
draw their pickets at that time.
“Workers who have not already
returned to work should do so
beginning with the first shift on
Monday, consistent with opera
tion needs.”
