# Trustees Wary Of Flood Dam
## 
### 
Stanford's Board of Trustees
voted Thursday afternoon to put
up “vigorous opposition” to con
struction of the Ladera Dam
studied for several years by the
Army Corps of Engineers.
The protest will be made before
the corps’ river and harbors sec
tion in Washington, D.C. on Oct.
20.
On the day following the trus
tees’ vote, the Corps turned in a
favorable feasibility report on the
proposed dam and reservoir. The
report was made public by Rep.
Charles Gubscr (R-Gilroy) in
Washington.
A Stanford spokesman said Sat
urday the report will not alter
university opposition to the dam.
“We are not arguing that the dam
is not feasible we’re arguing it
is not in the best interests of
Stanford,” he said.
The trustees say they oppose
the dam site because it would use
up too much valuable land. The
reservoir would occupy 525 acres
on Stanford property. It^would be
midway between Searsville and
Felt Lakes, near the proposed lo
cation of the two-mile linear ac
celerator and the proposed Juni
pero Serra Freeway.
Stanford’s opposition almost
certainly would kill the $7.8 mil
lion dam, which San Mateo and
Santa Clara county officials re
gard as valuable for flood control
and water conservation purposes
along San Francisquito Creek,
common boundary of the counties!
