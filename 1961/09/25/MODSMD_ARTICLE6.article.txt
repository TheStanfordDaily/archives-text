## 
### 
XliiW YORK (UFI)— President Kennedy arrived here last
for a crucial cold war address before the United Nations in
which he is expected to restate American firmness on West Berlin

and attack Soviet attempts to gait
Flying in from Cape Cod, tf
nearly an hour in his 34th floor
suite at the Carlyle Hotel with
his top foreign policy advisers on
his speech tomorrow to the U.N.
General Assembly.
THE CONFEREES included
Secretary of State Dean Rusk;
John J. McCloy, chief U.S. dis
armament negotiator; Arthur F.
Dean, head nuclear test ban ne
gotiator; Ha r land Cleveland,
Assistant Secretary of State for
International Organization Af
fairs; and Theodore Sorenson,
counsel to the president and his
chief speech-writing assistant.
U.N. Ambassador Adlai Steven
son was scheduled to participate,
but because of the President's
late arrival due to fog on Cape
Cod, Stevenson had to stay at the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel where he
entertained a small dinner for
President Arturo Frondizi of Ar
gentina.
THE CARLYLE conference had
three main purposes, according
to members of Kennedy’s staff;
• To give Rusk and the others
a preview of the speech.
• To brief the President on de
velopments in the United Nations
since the General Assembly
opened last week.

n veto power over U.N. actions,
be chief executive conferred for

• To map future U.S. strategy
in the international body after
the President puts his formula
for peace before the delegates
today.
The speech which Kennedy will
deliver to the U.N. General As
sembly at 11:30 a.m. EOT today
ranges in topical emphasis from
the crisis in Berlin to the need
for maintaining a powerful Unit
ed Nations under a Secretariat
which will not be dominated by
any one power bloc.
SOVIET PREMIER Nikita
Khrushchev has called for the
abolition of the job held by Dag
Hammarskjold, th c Secretary
General killed in a plane crash
while on a peace mission to the
Congo. Khrushchev’s plan would
supplant the Secretary General
with a throe-man Secretariat
one each from the east, west and
neutralist camps—-and each hold
ing a veto power.
According to reliable informa
tion, Kennedy’s speech will cover
these five areas:
—Broad new U.S. proposals for
general disarmament, along with
a new effort to obtain Soviet
agreement to an immediate ban
on nuclear tests in the atmos
phere and, possibly, a properly
policed ban on other forms of
nuclear blast experiments.
Reaffirmation of this coun
try’s insistence upon western
rights in Berlin.
—EMPHASIS on the need for a
strong and vibrant United Na
tions organization.
—Clear insistence that the late
Secretary-General Dag Hammar
skjold’s U.N. role be continued
by a single, potent directing force
rather than the three-headed body
demanded by Soviet Premier Ni
kita S. Khrushchev.
—Reassortion of the need for
the U.N. to lead the way in hav
ing established, more prosperous
nations help the world’s under
developed areas to grow toward
self-sufficiency.
