Any student who signed for a
Senior Colloquium at pre-regis
tration but does not now plan
to fake it is requested to report
this at the class list section in
the Pavilion so that the space
can be made available for some
one else.
In order that scheduled col
loquia will meet existing needs,
no student will receive credit
toward graduation for more
than two colloquia.
