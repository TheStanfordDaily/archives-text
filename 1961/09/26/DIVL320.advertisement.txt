COMPUTERS CAN NOW TRADE DATA COAST TO COAST OVER TELEPHONE LINES'
IBM has developed systems of computer-to-com
puter communication, which foretell the greatest
advances in data processing since the introduction
of the stored-program computer. These Tele-Proc
essing* systems greatly extend the useful range of
data processing—puttingtheir power at the disposal
of businessmen and scientists located miles away,
j Now it is possible to transmit data between two
computer installations at speeds up to 62,500 char
acters per second via broad-band communications
channels. Any number of computing systems can be
linked in this way in order to exchange information
or feed it to a data processing center. As a result,
although they may be separated by a continent,
computers can bring their capacities to bear on a
single massive problem or operation.
There can be an exciting future for the graduate
at IBM. The choice of jobs is wide. Advancement
potential is excellent. All qualified applicants will
receive consideration for employment without re
gard to race, creed, color or national origin. What
ever your talents and skills, there may be just the
job you’ve always looked forward to after college.
