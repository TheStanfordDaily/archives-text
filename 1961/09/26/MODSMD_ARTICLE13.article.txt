# Stanford's Accelerator Is Approved
## 
### 
A Senate-House committee yes
terday approved a public works
bill including Sll4 million to build
Stanfordâ€™s two-mile long linear
electron accelerator to be used in
high energy physics research.
The bill must now be approved
by both Senate and House before
being sent to the White House.
In the rush for adjournment, this
approval is taken to be a matter
of course.
THE accelerator, called Project
M, will be built on university land
west of the campus and south of
Sand Hill Road. Construction is
expected to take six years.
The facilities for the accelerator
will consist of two two-mile long
tunnels, one to contain the accel
erator itself and one for the power
equipment and technical person
nel. Due to the great radiation
produced by the operating accel
erator, it will he buried 35 feel
down.
ELECTRONS will be acceler
ated to ten BEV (Billion electron
volts) at first first with the power
of 240 klystron tubes. Later, more
tubes may be added to boost pow
er to 45 BEV.
This design is basically the same
as the 1 BEV machine that the
Stanford Physics department is
operating, only thirty times as
long.
This design is in contrast to
other large accelerators being
built in the United States and Rus
sia, which are circular. Project M
will be using electrons instead of
the heavier protons, and must be
built linearly to reduce radiation
loss. I
