# Kennedy's Speech—A Plea for Sanity
## 
### 
President Kennedy’s speech to the United Nations yesterday
was an encouraging note in a world which seems to he slipping
day after day toward oblivion.
The president showed an acute awareness of the problems fac
ing the world and the U.N. itself, and his challenging Russia to a
“peace race” puts pressure on Khrushchev for a change.
Especially encouraging was his statement that the West is not
tied to an unyielding position on the future of Berlin. “We are
committed to no rigid formulas. Wo see no perfect solution,” he
said.
The president told the world parliament that possible negotia
tions on Berlin “are now being explored.”
We were disappointed, however, in his threat to use nuclear
weapons to defend the Western rights in Berlin. We would rather
have heard a report that negotiations on the Berlin situation were
in the process of being set up. If the president wants to impress
Khrushchev with the fact the U.S, will use nuclear weapons to “pro
tect’ Berlin he can do it through private diplomatic notes in much
clearer language than is possible in public.
His obvious failure to mention Red China also is unfortunate.
He could have scored a major victory for the U.S. in the world and
the U.N. by calling for U.N. study—with U.S. backing—of a work
able way of getting Red China into the United Nations without
throwing Formosa out.
But the eloquent speech could easily serve as a practical but
still idealistic blueprint for sane progress toward peaceful solu
tions to the world’s woes.
The detailed three-stage disarmament program submitted later
yesterday morning to the General Assembly is an example. If Rus
sian leaders truly desire to compete with the West in a peaceful
world they will seriously study Kennedy’s proposals and, along
with other U.N. members, work to “advance together step by step,
stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been
achieved.”
If Russia refuses to work with the U.S., through the United Na
tions, to bring an immediate halt to nuclear testing and to hammer
out an acceptable disarmament plan, then war—incredibly—would
seem almost inevitable.
Never has the case for humanity been better articulated than
when the president said:
“. . . The events and decisions of the next 10 months may well
decide the fate of man for the next 10,000 years. And we . . . shall
be remembered either as the generation that turned this planet into
a flaming pyre or the generation that met its vow ‘to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war.’ ”

His obvious failure to mention Red China also is unfortunate.
He could have scored a major victory for the U.S. in the world and
the U.N. by calling for U.N. study—with U.S. backing—of a work
able way of getting Red China into the United Nations without
throwing Formosa out.
But the eloquent speech could easily serve as a practical but
still idealistic blueprint for sane progress toward peaceful solu
tions to the world’s woes.
The detailed three-stage disarmament program submitted later
yesterday morning to the General Assembly is an example. If Rus
sian leaders truly desire to compete with the West in a peaceful
world they will seriously study Kennedy’s proposals and, along
with other U.N. members, work to “advance together step by step,
stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been
achieved.”
If Russia refuses to work with the U.S., through the United Na
tions, to bring an immediate halt to nuclear testing and to hammer
out an acceptable disarmament plan, then war—incredibly—would
seem almost inevitable.
Never has the case for humanity been better articulated than
when the president said:
“. . . The events and decisions of the next 10 months may well
decide the fate of man for the next 10,000 years. And we . . . shall
be remembered either as the generation that turned this planet into
a flaming pyre or the generation that met its vow ‘to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war.’ ”
President Kennedy’s speech to the United Nations yesterday
was an encouraging note in a world which seems to he slipping
day after day toward oblivion.
The president showed an acute awareness of the problems fac
ing the world and the U.N. itself, and his challenging Russia to a
“peace race” puts pressure on Khrushchev for a change.
Especially encouraging was his statement that the West is not
tied to an unyielding position on the future of Berlin. “We are
committed to no rigid formulas. Wo see no perfect solution,” he
said.
The president told the world parliament that possible negotia
tions on Berlin “are now being explored.”
We were disappointed, however, in his threat to use nuclear
weapons to defend the Western rights in Berlin. We would rather
have heard a report that negotiations on the Berlin situation were
in the process of being set up. If the president wants to impress
Khrushchev with the fact the U.S, will use nuclear weapons to “pro
tect’ Berlin he can do it through private diplomatic notes in much
clearer language than is possible in public.
