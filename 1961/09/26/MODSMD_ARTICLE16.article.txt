## World Praises President's Address to United Nations 
### DONALD R. SHANOR United Press International 
Western, Communist, and neu
tralist spokesmen were in agree
ment yesterday in their praise of
at least some parts of President
Kennedy’s United Nations speech,
Kennedy’s challenge of the So
viet Union to a “peace race’’ won
the unqualified support of both
U.S. Democratic and Republican
loaders, including former Presi
dent Eisenhower.
There was no official Soviet
comment, but unofficial Soviet
sources in Moscow hailed the
speech as an indication of increas
ing flexibility in American for
eign policy. They also were
cheered by the President’s refer
ence to general and complete dis
armament and his condemnation
of nuclear war.
SOVIET FOREIGN Minister
Anrei Gromyko did not join in the
applause at the end of the speech,
but told Kennedy later: “You were
in good form today.”
Burmese Ambassador U Thant,
a leader of the U.N. neutrals, said
“It was a very constructive
speech and should be very helpful
in the discussion of the two items
disarmament and the U.N. sec
retariat.”
Ahmad Shukairy, Saudi Arabi
an minister of state and another
spokesman for the unaligned na
tions, said “I admired the princi
ples enunciated by President Ken
nedy in his historic speech.”
THE UNITED States’ allies in
Europe and Asia joined in the
praise.
“A strong stimulus for all
those who want to preserve the
United Nations as an efective in
strument of peace,” Dutch For
eign Minister J. M. A. T. Luns
said.
“The federal government will

do all in its power to support the
American proposal” on disarma
ment, a West German spokesman
said. “The plan provides a realis
tic as well as useable basis for
negotiations.”
THE WEST Gorman press gen
erally praised the speech but ex
pressed some misgivings on Ken
nedy’s policy toward Communist
East Germany. The Berliner Mor
genpost hailed his pledge on Ber
lin’s continued freedom.
“But a bitter drop is mixed into
our joy,” it added, urging “an of
ficial statement from Washing
ton on whether the freedom of
West Berlin should be bought with
the renunciation of German reuni
fication.”
In Washington, Republicans put
aside criticism of the administra
tion’s foreign policy and joined
with Democrats in hailing the
President’s statements.
EISENHOWER, who recently
attacked some aspects of Ken
nedy’s foreign policy, said he
agreed with his declaration that
the world would not find security
in cver-gorwing arsenals.
The speech “summed up the
hopes, the aspirations of all the
American people,” GOP National
Chairman William E. Miller said.
Senate GOP Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois welcomed Ken
nedy’s firm stand on Berlin and
the U.N. secretariat and applaud
ed him for laying out a “magni
ficent hope” for peace.
Senate Democratic leader Mike
Mansfield, Mont., expressed hope
that the address woud ease world
tensions.
Republican Gov. Wesley Powell
of New Hampshire, chairman of
the national governors’ confer
ence, said the speech “may one
day be recorded as a great docu
ment of human history.”

loaders, including former Presi
dent Eisenhower.
There was no official Soviet
comment, but unofficial Soviet

erally praised the speech but ex
pressed some misgivings on Ken
nedy’s policy toward Communist
East Germany. The Berliner Mor
genpost hailed his pledge on Ber

our joy,” it added, urging “an of
ficial statement from Washing
ton on whether the freedom of
