## 'Identity of Dr. Frazier' Exciting, Penetrating' 
### 
Is there, hidden in the depths
of each of us, another personality,
which, if it emerged, would ex
press our frustrations, hates and
prejudices stretching all the way
back to our childhood?
From the days of Dr. Jekyll to
those of Sigmund Freud the con
cept of a subconscious will, over
which the individual seemingly
has no control, has been the sub
ject of endless discussion.
The latest probings into the
meaning of the subconscious act
come in an exciting and penetrat
ing novel by George Sklar, “The
Identity of Dr. Frazier” (Knopf
$3.95).
SKLAR, one of the most import
ant social playwrights of the
1930’5, has been writing novels
since the end of World War 11.
This is his fourth. His talent as a
playwright is often evident in this
novel. The dialogue is crisp and
each scene leads smoothly into the
next. A protracted and terrifying
drunk incident is expertly and
minutely described as if for a
stage or movie performance.
Dr. Alexander Frazier is a
wealthy and successful Beverly
Hills surgeon and a high-ranking
staff member of a Jewish hos
pital, though he is a gentile.
ON A Now Year’s weekend in
Mexico with several other doctors
as well as an influential member
of the hospital board, Frazier gets
violently drunk. He assaults some
of his colleagues, accuses his wife
of infidelity with an old flame and
shouts some vicious anti-Semitic
obscenities. He awakens the next
morning with no knowledge of
what he has done.
Frazier's (and Sklar’s) result
ing search for the reasons behind
his behavior that night is a mas
terly performance. The reasoning
in this direction is as convincing
and uncomplicated as so complex
a subject will allow.
EQUALLY well done are Fra
zier’s relationships after the in
cident with his pregnant wife, the
other doctors, the hospital board
member and his wife’s parents
(she is Jewish and her father has

never forgiven her for marrying
a Gentile). These are all handled
with consummate logic. The end
result is vivid and satisfying ex
perience for the reader.

obscenities. He awakens the next
morning with no knowledge of
what he has done.
Frazier's (and Sklar’s) result
ing search for the reasons behind
his behavior that night is a mas
terly performance. The reasoning
in this direction is as convincing
and uncomplicated as so complex
a subject will allow.
EQUALLY well done are Fra
zier’s relationships after the in
cident with his pregnant wife, the
other doctors, the hospital board
member and his wife’s parents

with consummate logic. The end
result is vivid and satisfying ex

Is there, hidden in the depths
of each of us, another personality,
which, if it emerged, would ex
press our frustrations, hates and
prejudices stretching all the way
back to our childhood?
From the days of Dr. Jekyll to
those of Sigmund Freud the con
cept of a subconscious will, over
which the individual seemingly
has no control, has been the sub
ject of endless discussion.
The latest probings into the
meaning of the subconscious act
come in an exciting and penetrat
ing novel by George Sklar, “The
Identity of Dr. Frazier” (Knopf
$3.95).
SKLAR, one of the most import
ant social playwrights of the
1930’5, has been writing novels
since the end of World War 11.
This is his fourth. His talent as a
playwright is often evident in this
novel. The dialogue is crisp and
each scene leads smoothly into the
next. A protracted and terrifying
drunk incident is expertly and
minutely described as if for a
stage or movie performance.
Dr. Alexander Frazier is a
wealthy and successful Beverly
Hills surgeon and a high-ranking
staff member of a Jewish hos
pital, though he is a gentile.
ON A Now Year’s weekend in
Mexico with several other doctors
as well as an influential member
of the hospital board, Frazier gets
violently drunk. He assaults some
of his colleagues, accuses his wife
of infidelity with an old flame and
shouts some vicious anti-Semitic
obscenities. He awakens the next
morning with no knowledge of
what he has done.
