# Housing Badly Needed By 60 Male Transfers
## 
### 
An “urgent” appeal for housing for about 60 homeless male
transfer students was made yesterday by the University.
Record enrollment of more than 9,500 has completely filled all
housing on campus, leaving the sophomore and junior transfers
from other colleges and universitities out in the cold.

A University spokesman said
the appeal is directed to all fac
ulty who might have a spare
room, and to residents of Menlo
Aaks area and College Terrace
who might have a spare room.
Since most of the men have bi
cycles but not cars, rooms within
cycling or walking distance of the
campus are needed.
Stanford is asking Palo Alto
residents living near the campus
to rent rooms to the students for
the fall quarter.
The situation should ease by
winter quarter if the normal drop
out rate holds steady, but the sit
uation now is critical.
Homeowners willing to rent
rooms to the students should con
tact Mrs. Lee Elwood, housing
office supervisor, at extension
2306 at the University number of
DA 1-2300.
THE housing situation is com
plicated by the all-time high num
ber of undergraduate and gradu
ate students enrolled and by the
record 1,362 members of the Class
of ’65 which had an unusually
high acceptance rate from high
school seniors.
