# Algerian Students Clash
## 
### 
ALGIERS (UPD—Rioting stu
dents barricaded downtown Al
giers streets with captured buses
last night in a screaming demon
stration for a “French Algeria.”
Police and troops finally quelled
the rioting after menacing the
demonstrators with machine guns.
Thousands of riot police wield
ed clubs and turned pressure
hoses spurting blue-dyed water on
the students who turned out sev
eral hundred strong in a demon
stration called by the Secret Army
Organization (OAS).
The rioting started when police
moved in to tear down black flags
of the right-wing underground
“secret army.” The clash-and-run
tussle between police and students
continued until after dark.
THERE WERE no reports of
casualties but at least eight per
sons were arrested.
Soldier's, menacing the rioters
with machine guns placed at stra
tegic city corners, managed to
avoid major violence.
The rioting reached a climax
when a band seized a city bus and
drove it to an intersection of the
Rue Michelet, Algier s’ main street.
The youths swung the bus side
ways across the street and punc
tured its tires to form a barricade.
They reinforced the barricade a
few minutes later with another
captured bus.
IN THE Western port city of
Oran, two European civilians and
two French soldiers were wound
ed in knife and shooting attacks
by Moslems.
Police went into action against
300 students in the region where
settler extremists set up barri
cades in January, 1960, in a revolt
against President Charles de
Gaull. The extremists are resist
ing De Gaulle’s intention to give
Algeria its independence.
The outbreak came on a day in
which the OAS had asked French

settlers to fly their black “secret
army” flaps from buildings in Al
geria’s main cities.
YESTERDAY’S student demon
stration broke out around 4:15
p.m. when the students surged
from their university into streets
guarded by thousands of troops
and police who had been out since
dawn tearing down the black OAS
flags as they appeared.
