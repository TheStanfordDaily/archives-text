## On Berlin Negotiations 
### 
As we get ready to negotiate
about Berlin, we need to know
concretely what is our commit
ment. A month ago the answer to
this question was plain enough.
When we said we would defend
the freedom of West Berlin, we
meant, to be precise, that people
and goods must continue to move
freely along the air corridors, the
turnpikes, the railroads, and the
canals. If access on these routes
is open, West Berlin will have the
physical basis of its freedom, free
dom to elect its government, per
sonal liberty, and economic free
dom to act as part of the West
German economy.
THIS physical basis of West
Berlin’s freedom is what we are
committed to defend, if necessary
by war.
But while this commitment is
still in full force, the Soviet action
of Aug. 13 in sealing off East Ber
lin has raised a new problem. It is
whether the half-city can continue
to flourish, whether it will not
wither on the vine.
Dr. Adenauer’s ambassador has
said that Berlin will wither if the
physical partition of Germany,
which was consummated on Aug.
13, becomes an accepted and es
tablished fact. So we can no long
er say that if the access routes are
kept open, this in itself will make
secure the future of West Berlin.
IF THE half-city is to continue
to flourish, its people must be
given reason to believe that they
have a function to perform in the
future of the German nation. It is
not easy to give them that belief,
and while, as Vice President John
son has said rather too imprecise
ly, our lives, our fortunes and our
sacred honor are pledged in West
Berlin, we are in fact pledged to
protect access.
But we are not and cannot be
pledged to a guarantee of the pros
perity' of West Berlin. All we can
promise is to try, provided the
West Germans cooperate, to ne
gotiate a status for West Berlin
which will give its inhabitants a
sense of security and confidence
in the future. This cannot possibly
be done merely by standing firm
and standing pat.
The President will now have to
decide whether his objective in
the coming negotiations is merely
to keep open the access routes
or whether he will try for a wider
objective not only for the physi
cal freedom of West Berlin but for
its dignity and prosperity.
This is a hard and complicated
decision.
IF HE concentrates on the nar
row objective, he can probably
achieve it by standing firm on the
decision to resist if the access
routes are closed. For while the
Soviet Union will still have great
opportunity to harrass the access
routes, it does not have a vital
interest in blockading them.
But not to interfere with access,
or not to interfere very much, will
not be sufficient. The Allied rights
of access must be reconfirmed in
some kind of contract. For other
wise, the people of West Berlin
will be left in a dangerous and de
moralizing uncertainty. The Sovi
et price for a reconfirmation of
the rights of access will now have
to be explored.
Assuming the best, that the
price is moderate and honorable,
the outcome will leave West Ber
lin free. But after the action of
Aug. 13, Berlin, however free, will
be a doomed and dying city.
TO KEEP West Berlin not only
free but alive and flourishing it
will have to be given a significant
and attractive function to per
form in the years to come. If this
can be done at all, the coming ne
gotiations will have to go far be
yond freedom of access.
There will have to be a new at
tempt to negotiate a wide settle
ment in Germany and in central
Europe.
Our position today would be far
stronger if, last June instead of
conceding the initiative to Khrush
chev, we had launched a campaign
for a wide settlement.
BUT AS events have shown,
Americans, in the West European
opinion, have not been prepared
by their leaders for any such big
diplomatic adventure.
A wide settlement is inconceiv
able unless West and East agree
on some arrangement which
opens the door 1 to the eventual re
union of the two Germanys. The
difficulties of reaching such an
agreement are enormous.
There is, of course, the Soviet
opposition which is now embodied
in the physical partition of Ber
lin. But we must not forget how
strong is the Western opposition
to German reunification. It is not
an open opposition. But it is much
stronger than has been fully ap
preciated in this country.
The two chief Western Euro
pean institutions are NATO and
the Common Market. In both
there is a basic assumption that
in fact Germany will remain di
vided. There is no place for East
Germany in NATO not unless
we suppose the inconceivable,
which is that the Soviets would
permit East Germany to join
NATO.
AND THEBE IS no place for

East Germany in the Common
Market as long as it is a Com
munist state and its main econ
omic powers are with the Soviet
bloc.
Although it is never openly
avowed, the whole of Europe,
West and East, from France to
Poland and Czechoslovakia, is
deeply committed to the partition
of Germany. As for the Bonn re
public, its attitude is ambiguous.
It does not countenance partition,
but it has learned to live comfort
ably without reunification.
This would seem to argue that
there is an all-European consen
sus. In considerable measure there
is, and that is why there is no
crusading spirit in Europe to re
unify Germany. But in France
and in Germany the key to policy
is not that they object to the fact
of partition. It is that they fear
the effect of acknowledging it.
WHY? Because if Ihe partition
were signed, sealed, and delivered
which is what Khrushchev is
after the force of interests of
the West Germans in the Atlantic
Alliance will have been weakened.
Both Dr. Adenauer and Gen. de
Gaulle fear greatly what the Ger
mans would do then. Might they
not come to believe that they must
deal not with NATO but with
Moscow? Dr. Adenauer and Gen.
de Gaulle are haunted by the fear
that one of Dr. Adenauer’s suc
cessors may do once again what
the Germans have so often done
in the past make a deal with
the Russians at the expense of
the West.
The men charged with German
affairs in Paris and Washington
are predisposed to think that, all
things considered, the status quo
is better than anything which can
be negotiated. The wider objec
tive, which is to work out a future
for West Berlin, has few official
supporters. In the calculus of
risks it seems too venturesome.
It is venturesome.
BUT NOTHING ventured, noth
ing gained. It will probably force
the opening of what the President
might call a New Frontier in Eu
ropean politics, beginning with a
recognition of the fact that there
are two German states, and that
unless and until they reunite,
West Berlin must be held in trust
as an international city.
Moreover, in order to stabilize
this divisional arrangement, there
almost certainly would have to be
an agreement on controlled nu
clear disarmament and reduction
of conventional armament from,
let us say, the Rhine to the Vis
tula.
A philosopher of history can
say that the world is still too prim
itive to construct rationally such
a solution. But he might add that
if catastrophe is averted, some
such settlement might gradually
come into being.
ll' THIS solution is premature,
then negotiation will have to turn
on the narrower objective, which
would be a contract concerning
physical access to West Berlin.
Without such a contract the Ger
mans and the rest of us will have
no relief from permanent appre
hension and anxiety.
The President himself cannot
negotiate such a contract with Mr.
Khrushchev. The critical decision
to be taken in the West is what
price to pay for the contract. This
decision must be made with the
firm cooperation of the West Ger
man government. After the Ger
man election, Bonn will have to
nerve itself to face the fact that
unless there is a very wide central
European settlement, the partition
of Germany will become frozen
as an accomplished fact.
