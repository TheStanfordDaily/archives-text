## Stop that Trembling, Freshmen 
### 
Stop trembling, freshmen. Ev
erything seems so large, so cha
otic, so incomprehensible, hut
have no fear. Soon you will be
well-adjusted citizens of the Stan
ford community.
You will be helped to adjust to
your living quarters, teachers,
food and fellow students. After
all, the key word at Stanford is
ADJUSTMENT. Stanford is not
alone. Most “institutions of higher
learning” stress the primary im
portance of the "creation of the
well-adjusted individual.”
Intellectual pursuits are there
fore discouraged.
INTELLECTUALISM, the the
ory goes, leads to maladjustment.
Intellectualism is concerned with
ascertaining truths, whatever the
cost. Truths, as everyone knows,
are often unpleasant, dishearten
ing and discouraging. They often
force a person to re-examine some
of his values, some of his beliefs.
He may be forced to recognize un
pleasant realities. He may become
maladjusted!
An intellectual is a social mis
fit. He cannot find his “station in
life.” He cannot tolerate the ob
sequiousness and pedantry which
engulf him. Society, of course,
calls obsequiousness “sociability”
and pedantry "intelligence.”
This social misfit may disagree
strongly with the chairman of
some “important committee.” He

wants to ascertain truth, no mat
ter what the others may think of
him or the truth. Needless to say,
such a brash, annoying upstart
will not be invited to the next com
mittee meeting.
STANFORD HELPS you to be
come a well-adjusted committee
member. Your student compatri
ots will like you, for you will be
“well-adjusted.” If you disagree
with a fellow student, you will
smile blandly and say: “John, I
feel you are wrong.” You will not
say: “John, I THINK you are
wrong.” “Think” is a strong word
and may hurt your friend’s feel
ings.
Besides, if you say “think,” you
may have to defend your argu
ment with some cogent thoughts.
If you “feel” something, you can
avoid a debate and some unpleas
antness by claiming that feelings
are indescribable.
The faculty does not promote
the cause of intellectualism. Lec
tures are usually vacuous. Exam
inations, once you understand
“the system,” are relatively sim
ple.
“THE SYSTEM” is to say as
little possible in as many words
possible. It does not matter thal
your answer could be more cogent
if moxe concise or that your gram
mar, syntax and spelling are
shameful. That is the English in
structors’ worry.

Students who quiver and shake
at the thought of essay examina
tions also have a “system.” They
will simply list memorized facts.
“The tenets of Zoroastrianism
are ...” Never mind that the stu
dent is unable to put together
three consecutive ideas in accept
able prose.
Never mind that he does not
understand the tenets of Zoro
astrianism. He will receive just
reward for his incompetence and
laziness; a high grade.
Most important, faculty mem
bers protect students from a very
disturbing and very important
truth: students are not as intelli
gent as they think they are. This
truth would upset students.
THEY WOULD realize their in
ability to cope with rigorous prob

lems of the mind. They would not
be “well-adjusted” since their in
ane and secure world would go up
in smoke.
A university worthy of its
name has one purpose: promotion
of intellect and the pursuit of
truths. Stanford does not seem
ready to promote this purpose.
However, you can content your
selves with the fact that although
your diploma will not mean you
have learned or thought, your em
ployer will not hold that against
you.
