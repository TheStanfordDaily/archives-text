# Horde of Bright Papoose Prospects Hold Promise of More Future Wins
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Freshman football coach Dan
Stavely is basking in an air of
quiet optimism these days, and
with good reason: he has been
blessed with one of the finest se
lections of frosh talent in recent
Stanford history.
Pointing the way for a tremen
dous group of running backs are
Allan C u it, Phil Humphreys, and
John Paye. They were singled out
of a whole drawer-ful of halfbacks
who are characterized by Stavely
as “better than last year. Both
bigger and much faster.”
CURB HAILS from Culver City,
stands a shade over six feet, and
has been rated as one of the Hnest
backs in Southern California.
Humphreys comes to Stanford
from Medford, Oregon, where he
played quarterback and ran in
the sprints with conspicuous suc
cess. He’s 5-11, 185 pounds.
Paye measures 5-10, 185 pounds,
and makes his home in Grass Val
ley. He also was a sprinter in
high school.
OTHER BACKS who may help
to give the Papooses their best
ground offense in years:
Frank Bunch, La Canada, who
was a third string high school All-
American.
Mark Ciabaltari from Butte,
Montana, who played on the state

championship team as well as be
ing an outstanding sprinter.
BUCKV ROSEN, from Willow
Glen High School in San Jose, the
most outstanding player in his
league last year.
Bud Wedin, a topflight hurdler
besides being a standout football
prospect.
At fullback, Coach Stavely in
dicated Bob Rath as the early
leader. Rath, 6-0, 184, and hailing
from Grandview, Washington, is
also a hurdler and pole vaulter.
His brothers Denny and Leßoy
both starred for Washington
State.
TWO FINE quarterback pros
pects are Dick Berg and Dick
Ragsdale. Stavely pointed to Berg
as a fine passer and to Ragsdale
as a superb running quarterback,
although a little weak on passing.
At end, Morrison Warren, a sol
id 6-2, 190 pounder, is probably
the most outstanding of a talent
laden group. Warren is from
South Mountain High in Phoenix,
Arizona. He drew plaudits from
Stavely as the “fastest member of
the squad to date.”
Another topflight end is Braden

Beck, 6-2, 180 pounds, from Baton
Rouge, Louisiana. According to
Stavely, Beck was “all everything
down there.”
MORE promising end candi
dates include Robert Howard,
Gary Hart, an all-CIF selection
from Santa Barbara; Guy Roun
seville, from Bakersfield, and
Gary Titchenal, whose father
coaches at San Jose.
Joe Neal was pointed out as the
best prospect on the interior line.
The rugged 5-11, 205 pound guard
has also been praised by his coach
as an outstanding linebacker.
At tackle, John Wilbur and
John Wilkin, a pair of 215 pound
ers. seem to be the best prospects
thus far.
CENTER is the least trouble
some spot and little wonder; the
Papooses are three-deep in out
standing prospects.
Duke Samson shows up as the
best to date. At 6-3, 205 pounds,
he is a fine linebacker as well as
center. He was an all-district pick
while in high school in Odessa,
Texas.

Terry Cassady, at 220 pounds,
and Stan Tarter, weighing 200,
back him up.
“OP’ COURSE, you have to re
member I haven’t seen any of
these boys under game conditions
yet,” said Stavely, reverting to the
traditional pre-season caution of
all football coaches.
The frosh mentor indicated that
he may have more exact informa
tion on the behavior of his charges
after a scrimmage with the Santa
Clara frosh, scheduled for October
first.
The frosh open their season of
ficially against the U.S.C. fresh
men in Los Angeles on October
fourteenth.

the sprints with conspicuous suc
cess. He’s 5-11, 185 pounds.
Paye measures 5-10, 185 pounds,
and makes his home in Grass Val
ley. He also was a sprinter in
high school.
OTHER BACKS who may help
to give the Papooses their best
ground offense in years:
Frank Bunch, La Canada, who
was a third string high school All-
American.
Mark Ciabaltari from Butte,
Montana, who played on the state

championship team as well as be
ing an outstanding sprinter.
BUCKV ROSEN, from Willow
Glen High School in San Jose, the
most outstanding player in his
league last year.
Bud Wedin, a topflight hurdler
besides being a standout football
prospect.
At fullback, Coach Stavely in
dicated Bob Rath as the early
leader. Rath, 6-0, 184, and hailing
from Grandview, Washington, is
also a hurdler and pole vaulter.
His brothers Denny and Leßoy
both starred for Washington
State.
TWO FINE quarterback pros
pects are Dick Berg and Dick
Ragsdale. Stavely pointed to Berg
as a fine passer and to Ragsdale
as a superb running quarterback,
although a little weak on passing.
At end, Morrison Warren, a sol
id 6-2, 190 pounder, is probably
the most outstanding of a talent
laden group. Warren is from
South Mountain High in Phoenix,
Arizona. He drew plaudits from
Stavely as the “fastest member of
the squad to date.”
Another topflight end is Braden

Beck, 6-2, 180 pounds, from Baton
Rouge, Louisiana. According to
Stavely, Beck was “all everything
down there.”
MORE promising end candi
dates include Robert Howard,
Gary Hart, an all-CIF selection
from Santa Barbara; Guy Roun
seville, from Bakersfield, and
Gary Titchenal, whose father
coaches at San Jose.
Joe Neal was pointed out as the
best prospect on the interior line.
The rugged 5-11, 205 pound guard
has also been praised by his coach
as an outstanding linebacker.
At tackle, John Wilbur and
John Wilkin, a pair of 215 pound
ers. seem to be the best prospects
thus far.
CENTER is the least trouble
some spot and little wonder; the
Papooses are three-deep in out
standing prospects.
Duke Samson shows up as the
best to date. At 6-3, 205 pounds,
he is a fine linebacker as well as
center. He was an all-district pick
while in high school in Odessa,
Texas.

Terry Cassady, at 220 pounds,
and Stan Tarter, weighing 200,
back him up.
“OP’ COURSE, you have to re
member I haven’t seen any of
these boys under game conditions
yet,” said Stavely, reverting to the
traditional pre-season caution of
all football coaches.
The frosh mentor indicated that
he may have more exact informa
tion on the behavior of his charges
after a scrimmage with the Santa
Clara frosh, scheduled for October
first.
The frosh open their season of
ficially against the U.S.C. fresh
men in Los Angeles on October
fourteenth.

GUARD JOE NEAL BULWARKS FROSH LINE
Among some of the finest Papoose football prospects in years, 5-11,
205-pound guard Joe Neal from Downey High of Modesto stands
out. He's been described by Coach Dan Stavely as "a very touch

Freshman football coach Dan
Stavely is basking in an air of
quiet optimism these days, and
with good reason: he has been
blessed with one of the finest se

Pointing the way for a tremen

Allan C u it, Phil Humphreys, and
John Paye. They were singled out
of a whole drawer-ful of halfbacks
who are characterized by Stavely
as “better than last year. Both
bigger and much faster.”
CURB HAILS from Culver City,
stands a shade over six feet, and
has been rated as one of the Hnest
backs in Southern California.

At fullback, Coach Stavely in
dicated Bob Rath as the early
leader. Rath, 6-0, 184, and hailing
from Grandview, Washington, is
also a hurdler and pole vaulter.
His brothers Denny and Leßoy
both starred for Washington
State.
TWO FINE quarterback pros
pects are Dick Berg and Dick
Ragsdale. Stavely pointed to Berg
as a fine passer and to Ragsdale
as a superb running quarterback,
although a little weak on passing.
At end, Morrison Warren, a sol
id 6-2, 190 pounder, is probably
the most outstanding of a talent
laden group. Warren is from
South Mountain High in Phoenix,
Arizona. He drew plaudits from
Stavely as the “fastest member of
the squad to date.”
Another topflight end is Braden

Beck, 6-2, 180 pounds, from Baton
Rouge, Louisiana. According to
Stavely, Beck was “all everything
down there.”
MORE promising end candi
dates include Robert Howard,
Gary Hart, an all-CIF selection
from Santa Barbara; Guy Roun
seville, from Bakersfield, and
Gary Titchenal, whose father
coaches at San Jose.
Joe Neal was pointed out as the
best prospect on the interior line.
The rugged 5-11, 205 pound guard
has also been praised by his coach
as an outstanding linebacker.
At tackle, John Wilbur and
John Wilkin, a pair of 215 pound
ers. seem to be the best prospects
thus far.
CENTER is the least trouble
some spot and little wonder; the
Papooses are three-deep in out
standing prospects.
Duke Samson shows up as the
best to date. At 6-3, 205 pounds,
he is a fine linebacker as well as
center. He was an all-district pick
while in high school in Odessa,
Texas.

Terry Cassady, at 220 pounds,
and Stan Tarter, weighing 200,
back him up.
“OP’ COURSE, you have to re
member I haven’t seen any of
these boys under game conditions
yet,” said Stavely, reverting to the
traditional pre-season caution of
all football coaches.
The frosh mentor indicated that
he may have more exact informa
tion on the behavior of his charges
after a scrimmage with the Santa
Clara frosh, scheduled for October
first.
The frosh open their season of
ficially against the U.S.C. fresh
men in Los Angeles on October
fourteenth.

GUARD JOE NEAL BULWARKS FROSH LINE
Among some of the finest Papoose football prospects in years, 5-11,
205-pound guard Joe Neal from Downey High of Modesto stands
out. He's been described by Coach Dan Stavely as "a very touch
hombre."
Freshman football coach Dan
Stavely is basking in an air of
quiet optimism these days, and
with good reason: he has been
blessed with one of the finest se
lections of frosh talent in recent
Stanford history.
Pointing the way for a tremen
dous group of running backs are
Allan C u it, Phil Humphreys, and
John Paye. They were singled out
of a whole drawer-ful of halfbacks
who are characterized by Stavely
as “better than last year. Both
bigger and much faster.”
CURB HAILS from Culver City,
stands a shade over six feet, and
has been rated as one of the Hnest
backs in Southern California.
Humphreys comes to Stanford
from Medford, Oregon, where he
played quarterback and ran in
the sprints with conspicuous suc
cess. He’s 5-11, 185 pounds.
Paye measures 5-10, 185 pounds,
and makes his home in Grass Val
ley. He also was a sprinter in
high school.
OTHER BACKS who may help
to give the Papooses their best
ground offense in years:
Frank Bunch, La Canada, who
was a third string high school All-
American.
Mark Ciabaltari from Butte,
Montana, who played on the state

championship team as well as be
ing an outstanding sprinter.
BUCKV ROSEN, from Willow
Glen High School in San Jose, the
most outstanding player in his
league last year.
Bud Wedin, a topflight hurdler
besides being a standout football
prospect.
At fullback, Coach Stavely in
dicated Bob Rath as the early
leader. Rath, 6-0, 184, and hailing
from Grandview, Washington, is
also a hurdler and pole vaulter.
