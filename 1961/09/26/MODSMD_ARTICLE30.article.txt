# Campus Bike Shop Torn Down
## 
### 
A pile of rubble today marks
the spot where the Campus Hike
Shop a landmark for more than
a decade and haven for thousands
of bike-riding Stanford students
once stood.
As a result, owner Fred Morse
has moved from the old shop next
to the vanished Shell station and
moved to a new spot. The new lo
cation is across from the Health
Service on the south side of the
Women’s Cym. and is hidden be
hind a row of trees fronting Santa
Teresa Street across from Roble.
Morse was forced to move out
in early September because the
expansion of the University Press
will take up the land where he and
the gas station were.
MORSE had been in the old
building since 1948, and admitted
“It’s kind of rough to leave the old
shack’’ but “it was cramped in
there.”
The new building was moved
from Stanford land in Menlo Park
at no cost to him, and is much
larger. Morse thinks the old shop
was built “sometime during the
war.”
He has watched the bicycle
boom on campus for 13 years,
both as student and proprietor of
the bike shop. He has owned the
shop since 1951 and worked there
when he attended Stanford from
1948 to 1950.
HE NOTES that the rapid dis
appearance of parking spaces and
closing off of roads have clearly
numbered the days of usefulness
of a car for transportation on the
main part of the campus.
Since World War II ended,
roads once open to auto traffic
have been closed and many park
ing places have been gradually
swallowed up by the burgeoning
building program.
(This year, for instance, the
road in front of the Knoll has be
come a dead end and it no longer
is possible to drive past the post
office or up from Dinkelspiel past
the Zete house.)
PLANS HAVE been made to
close the academic part of the
campus and make it a pedestrian
mall. This already is taking shape
in the area from the corner of La
suen and Campus Drive down past
the post office to History Corner.
Within the next two or three
years, Campus Drive will be the
main traffic artery as such streets
as Lomita Drive which runs
past Roble down to Physics Cor
ner are slated to be barred to
autos.
All of which spells good busi
ness for Morse.
HE FEELS the 2.000 bikes on
campus will increase as the stu
dent population grows and autos
can’t be driven where they are
now.
While business usually is good.
Morse reports “we felt the reces
sion last year.” He normally sells
about 100 new and used bikes a
year, and repairs hundreds of
others.
Morse, his wife and the part
time student employee usually are
working on 10 to 20 bikes at a
time.
STUDENTS prefer the light
weight, multi-geared English
bikes, Morse notes. One reason is
that the imports sell for less than
their American competitors.
Most common problem with the
bikes is flat tires, he says.
“A lot of faculty members” ride
bicycles, he observes.
IN 1959 it became so dangerous
for students walking across Quad
that Legislature ordered the iron
gates at either end closed to bar
bicycles. The number of persons
flattened by bikes since then has
noticeably decreased.
But the bike boom goes on at
Stanford, and one of these days
students will be traveling around
campus the same way their pre
decessors did when the school
opened in 1891 entirely on bi
cycles or feet.
