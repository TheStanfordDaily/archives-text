# Kennedy Challenges Russ to Peace Race
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI)
President Kennedy said yester
day the United States would use
any moans, including nuclear
arms, to preserve its rights in
West Berlin but tempered his
tough stand by offering a compre
hensive disarmament program to
ensure v'orld peace.
Kennedy, in his first policy
speech to the United Nations as
sembly, challenged Russia to a
“peace race” that would call for
an immediate end to nuclear test
ing. He said the West was not
committed to a rigid formula for
settling Berlin’s future and sug
gested a free vote.
HE FLATLY rejected Rus
sia’s "Troika” plan of three secre
taries general, each with veto
power, to succeed the late Secre
tary General Dag Hammarsk jold.
He said to do so would “replace
order with anarchy, action with
paralysis and confidence with con
fusion.”

Appealing to the small and “un
committed” powers to preserve
lhe unity of the United Nations,
Kennedy said:
“The secretary general, in a
very real sense, is the servant of
this assembly. Diminish his au
thority and you diminish the au
thority of the only body where all
nations, regardless of power, are
equal and sovereign. Until all the
powerful are just, the weak will
be secure only in the strength of
this General Assembly.”
INTERRUPTED six times for
applause in his 40-minute speech,
the President made these other
points:
—The United Nations is divided
not into three forces, but two, one
trying to build a peaceful world
and the other seeking to under
mine the organization.
- -Disarmament negotiat ions
should “resume promptly, and
continue without interruption un
til an entire program for general

and complete disarmament has
not only been agreed upon but
has been actually achieved.”
—THK UNITED States and
Britain stand ready to sign “to
day” a treaty “assuring the end of
nuclear tests of all kinds, in every
environment, under workable con
trols.”
—All members should earmark
special units in their armed forces,
trained and quickly available, for
use in a U.N. peace force.
—The United States will pro
pose U.N, control to reserve outer
•space for peaceful use. It also
wants the U.N. to be the vehicle
for cooperative efforts in weather
prediction and control as well as
global communications by satel
lites.
— THK UNITED States propos
ed that the 1960’s be designated
as “the decade of development” to
promote conversion of all coun
tries into “free and equal nations”
through “a cooperative and not a
competitive enterprise.”
The United States “intends to be
a participant, and not merely an
observer, in the peaceful, expedi
tious movement of nations from
the status of colonies to the part
nership of equals.” But,’the Presi
dent said in his only direct attack
on the Soviet Union, “There is no
ignoring the fact that the tide of
self-determination has not yet
reached the Communist empire.”
—“The smouldering coals of
war in Southeast Asia” threaten
South Vietnam. The borders of
Burma, Cambodia and India have
been repeatedly violated. Negoti
ations on Laos are reaching a cru
cial stage with the rainy season
coming to an end. The United
States “seeks for itself no base,
no territory, no special position
in this area of any kind.”
EXCEPT FOR the Communist
bloc and Cuba, delegates in the
jam-packed assembly hall joined
in 45 seconds of applause—long by
U.N. standards as Kennedy fin
ished with this prayerful adjura
tion:
“The decision is ours. Never
have the nations of the world had
so much to lose or so much to
gain. Together we shall save our
planet or together we shall
perish in its flames. Save it we
can and save it we must and
then shall we earn the eternal
thanks of man and as peace
makers the eternal blessing of
God.”
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, scheduled to answer the
President in the assembly tomor
row, joined in the standing ap
plause as Kennedy was introduced
by Assembly President Mongi
Slim of Tunisia. He did not join
in the closing ovation, but later
ho told Kennedy:
“You were in good form today.”

INTERRUPTED six times for

trying to build a peaceful world
and the other seeking to under

nuclear tests of all kinds, in every
environment, under workable con

—All members should earmark
special units in their armed forces,
trained and quickly available, for
use in a U.N. peace force.
—The United States will pro

on the Soviet Union, “There is no

—“The smouldering coals of
war in Southeast Asia” threaten
South Vietnam. The borders of
Burma, Cambodia and India have
been repeatedly violated. Negoti

so much to lose or so much to

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI)
President Kennedy said yester
day the United States would use
any moans, including nuclear
arms, to preserve its rights in
West Berlin but tempered his
tough stand by offering a compre
hensive disarmament program to
ensure v'orld peace.
Kennedy, in his first policy
speech to the United Nations as
sembly, challenged Russia to a
“peace race” that would call for
an immediate end to nuclear test
ing. He said the West was not
committed to a rigid formula for
settling Berlin’s future and sug
gested a free vote.
HE FLATLY rejected Rus
sia’s "Troika” plan of three secre
taries general, each with veto
power, to succeed the late Secre
tary General Dag Hammarsk jold.
He said to do so would “replace
order with anarchy, action with
paralysis and confidence with con
fusion.”

Appealing to the small and “un
committed” powers to preserve
lhe unity of the United Nations,
Kennedy said:
“The secretary general, in a
very real sense, is the servant of
this assembly. Diminish his au
thority and you diminish the au
thority of the only body where all
nations, regardless of power, are
equal and sovereign. Until all the
powerful are just, the weak will

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI)
President Kennedy said yester
day the United States would use
any moans, including nuclear
arms, to preserve its rights in
West Berlin but tempered his
tough stand by offering a compre
hensive disarmament program to
ensure v'orld peace.
Kennedy, in his first policy
speech to the United Nations as
sembly, challenged Russia to a
“peace race” that would call for
an immediate end to nuclear test
ing. He said the West was not
committed to a rigid formula for
settling Berlin’s future and sug
gested a free vote.
HE FLATLY rejected Rus
sia’s "Troika” plan of three secre
taries general, each with veto
power, to succeed the late Secre
tary General Dag Hammarsk jold.
He said to do so would “replace
order with anarchy, action with
paralysis and confidence with con
fusion.”

Appealing to the small and “un
committed” powers to preserve
lhe unity of the United Nations,
Kennedy said:
“The secretary general, in a
very real sense, is the servant of
this assembly. Diminish his au
thority and you diminish the au
thority of the only body where all
nations, regardless of power, are
equal and sovereign. Until all the
powerful are just, the weak will
be secure only in the strength of
this General Assembly.”
INTERRUPTED six times for
applause in his 40-minute speech,
the President made these other
points:
—The United Nations is divided
not into three forces, but two, one
trying to build a peaceful world
and the other seeking to under
mine the organization.
- -Disarmament negotiat ions
should “resume promptly, and
continue without interruption un
til an entire program for general

and complete disarmament has
not only been agreed upon but
has been actually achieved.”
—THK UNITED States and
Britain stand ready to sign “to
day” a treaty “assuring the end of
nuclear tests of all kinds, in every
environment, under workable con
trols.”
—All members should earmark
special units in their armed forces,
trained and quickly available, for
use in a U.N. peace force.
—The United States will pro
pose U.N, control to reserve outer
•space for peaceful use. It also
wants the U.N. to be the vehicle
for cooperative efforts in weather
prediction and control as well as
global communications by satel
lites.
— THK UNITED States propos
ed that the 1960’s be designated
as “the decade of development” to
promote conversion of all coun
tries into “free and equal nations”
through “a cooperative and not a
competitive enterprise.”
