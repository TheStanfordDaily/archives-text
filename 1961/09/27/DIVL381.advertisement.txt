Frankly, there is no practical substitute
for the wheel today. But at Ford Motor
Company, our scientists and engineers
refuse to give "no" for an answer. They
are tackling, among others, the problem
of wheelless vehicles for tomorrow.
Is "tomorrow" really far off? Not according
to the men at Ford. Already they've devel
oped the Levacar as one possibility. It
replaces the wheel with levapads, per
forated discs which emit powerful air jets
to support the vehicle. Air suspension—if
you will—of an advanced degree. Imagine
traveling swiftly, safely at up to 500 mph,
riding on a tissue-thin film of air. Guided
unerringly by a system of rails. Propelled
by powerful turboprops. This is the
Levacar.
Meanwhile we’ve still got the wheel. And
the job of building better cars for today.
So we hope you won’t mind riding on
wheels just a little longer while we con
centrate on both tasks.
