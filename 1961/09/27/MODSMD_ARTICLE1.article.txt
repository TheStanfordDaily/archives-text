# Russia Rejects Kennedy Plea
## 
### 
UNITED NA I IONS, N Y. — ( UPI) — Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko yesterday rejected President Kennedy’s new dis
armament proposal. He declared that to open a nation’s armed
forces to inspection and control would clear the way for espionage.
In a policy speech to the United Nations General Assembly,

Gromyko also declared that the
Security Council must take up
the question of a successor to
the late Secretary General Dag
Hammarskjold — Presumably on
the basis of Russia’s three-man
“Troika” plan but called for a
"provisional solution” in the
meantime.
He declared that Russia re
sumed its nuclear tests in the
atmosphere in response to NATO
threats to use force in Germany
and said agreement on test ces
sation could be achieved, as pre
viously proposed by Russia, in
an overall treaty on “general and
complete disarmament.”
HE SAID nothing new on the
Berlin question, telling the As
sembly that Russia is “proposing
a settlement of the situation in
West Berlin on the basis of a
peace treaty, on conditions which
would not affect the prestige of
either the U.S.S.R. or the West
ern powers.”
Gromyko’s lengthy speech con
tained no disclosures of new So
viet foreign policy. Nor did he |
offer a reply to President Ken
nedy’s “peace race” speech to the
Assembly on Monday. Soviet
sources said Gromyko’s effort
was designed as a “parallel
speech” to the President's.
In addition to his major points,
Gromyko made these observa
tions on other issues;
—CONGO: he charged there
was a “colonialist” plan to dis
member the young republic by
taking from it mineral-rich Ka
tanga province. “True,” he said,
“the colonialists are not averse
to tripping each other up in the
Congo, but still the danger that
the Congo might be strangled on
the basis of a bargain between
them remains.”
—North Africa: he said France
is “paying lip service” to self
determination in Algeria while
waging war against Algerian na
tionalists and called on the United
Nations to “raise its voice in de
fense of the Algerian people.”
Last summer's four-day fighting
at Bizerte, he said, arose from
NATO support of "the colonial
ists against Tunisia.”
—China: he demanded immedi
ate seating of Communist China
and rejected the “extremely false
theory of two Chinas.”

fense of the Algerian people.”
Last summer's four-day fighting
at Bizerte, he said, arose from
NATO support of "the colonial
ists against Tunisia.”
—China: he demanded immedi
ate seating of Communist China
and rejected the “extremely false
theory of two Chinas.”
UNITED NA I IONS, N Y. — ( UPI) — Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko yesterday rejected President Kennedy’s new dis
armament proposal. He declared that to open a nation’s armed
forces to inspection and control would clear the way for espionage.
In a policy speech to the United Nations General Assembly,

Gromyko also declared that the
Security Council must take up
the question of a successor to
the late Secretary General Dag
Hammarskjold — Presumably on
the basis of Russia’s three-man
“Troika” plan but called for a
"provisional solution” in the
meantime.
He declared that Russia re
sumed its nuclear tests in the
atmosphere in response to NATO
threats to use force in Germany
and said agreement on test ces
sation could be achieved, as pre
viously proposed by Russia, in
an overall treaty on “general and
complete disarmament.”
HE SAID nothing new on the
Berlin question, telling the As
sembly that Russia is “proposing
a settlement of the situation in
West Berlin on the basis of a
peace treaty, on conditions which
would not affect the prestige of
either the U.S.S.R. or the West
ern powers.”
Gromyko’s lengthy speech con
tained no disclosures of new So
viet foreign policy. Nor did he |
offer a reply to President Ken
nedy’s “peace race” speech to the
Assembly on Monday. Soviet
sources said Gromyko’s effort
was designed as a “parallel
speech” to the President's.
In addition to his major points,
Gromyko made these observa
tions on other issues;
—CONGO: he charged there
was a “colonialist” plan to dis
member the young republic by
taking from it mineral-rich Ka
tanga province. “True,” he said,
“the colonialists are not averse
to tripping each other up in the
Congo, but still the danger that
the Congo might be strangled on
the basis of a bargain between
them remains.”
—North Africa: he said France
is “paying lip service” to self
determination in Algeria while
waging war against Algerian na
tionalists and called on the United
Nations to “raise its voice in de
fense of the Algerian people.”
