# Walter Lippmann On Nuclear Diplomacy
## 
### 
Never before have chiefs of
state been in a situation like that
in Germany today. For this was
the first encounter on vital issues
between great nuclear powers,
and there are no historical prece
dents, there is no accumulated ex
perience and wisdom, to guide
them. Khrushchev and Kennedy
possess what are for all practical
purposes equal and absolute weap
ons.

Khrushchev and Kennedy, Mac
millan, De Gaulle, and Adenauer
are working under conditions as
different from World War II as
flying a jet is different from run
ning a steam locomotive. None of
them has been taught how to con
duct diplomacy in a nuclear age.
All of them have to guess and to
Improvise, to experiment and to
hope.

There has been a revolution in
the military situation since the
previous encounter over Berlin
with Stalin in 1948. Then the
United States was the only nu
clear power in the world. But be
ginning with the late ’fifties the
Soviet Union with its nuclear
weapons and its rockets has be
come an equal nuclear power.
DURING THE critical ’fifties
Churchill and Eisenhower learned
what was happening to the bal
ance of power. Then the era of
summitry began. At the beginning
of this era Eisenhower made the
statement for which it may well
be he will be remembered the
longest. It was not sentimentality,
idealism, or pacifism, but the grim
truth about the hydrogen bomb
which caused President Eisen
hower to say that there is no long
er any "alternative to peace.”
Modern weapons have not mere
ly magnified and multiplied the
violence of war. They have revo
lutionized the nature of war by
introducing into it a new order of
violence.
Always until now, war and the
threat of war, whether aggressive
or defensive, were usable instru
ments for the national purpose.
THEY WERE usable because
wars could still be won or lost. In
the pie-nuclear wars the victori
ous power was an organized state
which could impose its will on the
vanquished.
The damage, though great, was
not irreparable, as wo know from
the recovery after World War II
of West Germany, Japan, and the
Soviet Union. But from a full nu
clear war, which might well mean
a hundred million dead, the devas
tation of the great urban centers,
and the contamination of the
earth, the water, and the air, there
would bo no such recovery.
The damage done would be mu
tual, there would be no victor,
and for all practical purposes the
ruin would be irreparable.
AMERICAN nuclear power can
reduce Soviet society to smoulder
ing ruins and leave the wretched
survivors shocked, starving, and
diseased. The Soviet Union can, it
is coolly estimated, kill between
30 and 70 million Americans. Such
a war would not be followed by
reconstruction.
It would be followed by a sav
age struggle for existence as the
survivors crawled out of their
shelters, and the American repub
lic would be replaced by a strin
gent military dictatorship trying
to keep some kind of order among
the desperate survivors.
It used to be said of the British
naval commander in the First
World War that if ho made a mis
take, he could lose the war in an
afternoon.
Khrushchev and Kennedy can
do that now. In a few hours
Khrushchev can lose the Soviet
state and the achievements and
the promises of the Communist
economy; Kennedy can lose the
constitution and the free enter
prise system and the American
way of life, and along with them
all the frontiers, old and new.
I DO NOT think that this is
overstated. A full nuclear war
would produce by far the biggest
convulsion which has ever occur
red since man appeared on this
planet.
In saying this my object is not
to add to the general creepiness.
Bu( wo cannot understand the re
alities of the Khrushchev-Kennedy
encounter unless we remind our

selves that nuclear war is not just
another war as history describes
wars, but a wholly new order of
violence.
Because the destructiveness of
the new armaments is equal and
virtually absolute, neither of the
two chiefs of government can
threaten the other with such a
war.

As long as each has kept his
own armory of weapons in order,
neither can or need believe the
nuclear threats of the other.
IF, FOR EXAMPLE, Khrush
chev has resumed testing not for
technical military reasons but for
terrorization, he will not and can
not terrorize President Kennedy.
For this testing cannot remove the
awful retaliatory power of the
United Slates nuclear weapon sys
tems.
In cold blood no government
can, no government will, start a
nuclear war with an equal nuclear
power. Only a moral idiot would
press the button. The poor dears
among us who say that they have
had enough and now let us drop
the bomb have no idea what they
are Jtalking about.
They have not been able to
imagine and realize what a nu
dlear war would be like. But the
governments know quite well
what a nuclear war would be like.
That is why there is bluff at the
core of any threat to initiate a
nuclear exchange. There is also a
wishful belief that the bluff will
work because it will not be called.
NEVERTHELESS, though a nu
clear war would be lunacy and is
unlikely, it is an ever-present pos
sibility.
Why? Because, however irra
tional it may be to commit suicide,
a natron can be provoked and ex
asperated to a point where its ner
vous system cannot endure inac
tion, where only violence can re
lieve its feelings.
This is one of the facts of life
in the middle of the twentieth cen
tury. It is as much a reality as a
megaton bomb, and in the nuclear
age it must be given weighty con
sideration in the calculation of
policy. There is a line of intoler
able provocation beyond which the
reactions are uncontrollable.
The governments must know
where that line is and they must
stay well back of it. Here lies the
greatest danger of miscalculation,
and therefore war.
BOTH SIDES, we had better re
alize, are capable of miscalculat
ing where that line is. Khrush
chev, who has no sufficient ex
perience of a state whose speech
is free, is prone to think that Ken
nedy can and should control an
explosion of popular feeling. The
fact is that there is a limit to
President Kennedy’s ability to
lead public opinion, and he is in
sight of that limit. Mr. Khrush
chev must make no mistake about
this.
For our part, we are prone to
suppose that because speech is
strictly regimented in the Soviet
Union, there are no irresistible in
ternal pressures on Khrushchev.
This can be a very dangerous il
lusion.
IN BOTH countries there is a
line which it is not safe for the
other to cross. It is the line where
compromise will be regarded as
humiliation and surrender. This
line will have to be made precise
in the negotiations. Blockade of
the access routes is such a line
for this country.
For the Soviet Union such a
line would be the giving of nuclear
arms to West Germany. These are
lines of provocation which cannot
be crossed without provoking un
controllable. indeed suicidal, reac
tions.
This being the nuclear age, it is
the paramount rule of internation
al politics that a great nuclear
power must not put another great
nuclear power in a position where
it must choose between suicide
and surrender.
And the corollary of this rule is
that no great nuclear power must
put itself in a position where it
has made such absolute and such
rigid stipulations that it can no
longer negotiate an honorable and
tolerable accommodation.
