## Laos Again Ready for Civil War 
### MICHAEL T. MALLOY 
VIENTIANE (UPI) If Laos
explodes again into civil war, as
many ranking diplomats here fear
may happen, the first blow prob
ably will fall within the next 90
days.
“Both sides can haggle and dis
agree now, without much worry,”
a Western source said, “but what
will they do with their armies
when fighting weather arrives?”
Fighting weather will arrive
this month or next, with the end
of the summer monsoon.
THEN THE hubcap deep mire
will evaporate from the roads,
rivers will drop to their normal
levels and the clouds will part to
permit full-scale supply drops
over the front lines.
At the same time, another ne
cessity of backwoods warfare
rice will spring up across the
country.
“Right now, it is hard even for
guerrillas to fight,” a Laotian
Royal Army colonel said. “They
cannot get rice from the villages
because even the peasants have
hardly enough for themselves.
“IT IS always like this in Laos
from Juno until harvest lime,” he
added. “Guerrillas can’t fight be
cause they can’t take rice from the
farmers. Regular troops can’t
fight because their convoys can’t
reach them over the muddy
roads.”
In the next three months, all
this will change. The first upland
rice ripens in September in Laos.
The rest of the crop comes in Oc
tober. Late in the following
month, the paddy rice is ready for
harvest.
“This is the most dangerous
time of the year,” a neutralist
diplomat warned.
HE pointed out that the Viet
minh invasion of 1953, the inva
sion of 1954, and the recent civil
war all coincided with the Laotian
dry season.
When the dry season does come,
it will find both sides more pre
pared for war than ever before.
While the armies rested during
the rainy season, their ranks were
beefed up with new recruits,
green men were drilled and veter
ans retrained.
THE STEADY airlift of arms
to both sides helped build up new
supply dumps, because new equip
ment was no longer wasted in re
placing combat losses.
“I’m afraid to see the rain stop,”
an Asian diplomat said.
“Both sides are too ready for
war. Neither has been willing to
give in at the conference table.”
Both the leftist Pathet Lao reb
els and the rightwing government
army have made preparations to
reopen their supply lines as soon
as the rains permit.
THE KEY to swift resumption
of road travel is the replacement
of bridges washed away by the
monsoon or burned in the civil
war.
Planeloads of pontoon bridges
have been priority items in the
latest American aid to the Lao
government.
They are considered so import
ant that two big C-130 transports
were used to fly the bridges into
the isolated Royal Army head
quarters at Luang Prabang.
Such big aircraft were never be
fore risked on the royal capital’s
short, rough airstrip, even though
they were the only planes which
could have brought tanks and
heavy vehicles into the city during
last year’s rebel attack.
