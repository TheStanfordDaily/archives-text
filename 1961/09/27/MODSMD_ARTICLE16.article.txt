Editor, The Daily:
Recently civil defense officials
in Bakerfield, in Riverside County
and in Nevada have announced
plans to shoot refugees from Los
Angeles who are expected to over
run their areas in case of nuclear
attack.
I hope our Bay Area civil de
fense officials have prepared simi
lar plans. Some problems are:
• Who is eligible to be shot,
the refugee from the next block,
the next city, the next county, the
next state or the next country?
• How does one tell the bucks
(refugees to be shot) from the
does (refugees from one’s own
district)?
• When does the season start?
• If shooting is the treatment
reserved for fellow Americans;
what treatment will we give the
Russian occupation soldiers?
These are tough questions, but
I am sure our civil defense offic
ials will solve them and preserve
our American way of life.
