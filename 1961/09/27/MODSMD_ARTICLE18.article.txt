### 
NEWPORT, R.I. (UPl)—Presi
dent Kennedy yesterday formally
created the nation’s first disarma
ment agency and then began a
week-long vacation on the wrong
foot when his plane blew out a
tire on landing.
The Air Force DC6 that flew
the President and Mrs. Kennedy
from Now York blow out a tire
while rolling down the runway
after landing at the Quonset
Point. R.I. Naval Air Station.
Six fire engines raced up to it,
hut the plane continued taxiing so
smoothly that most of those
aboard did not even know there
was trouble.
