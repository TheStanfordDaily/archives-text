## Urges 'Conservative Indoctrinators' at SU 
### 
A student is the ideological
child of his teacher. Proceeding
under the illusion of independent
thought, he is molded to conform
with the value judgments of his
instructors.

Thus education ci u be recog
nized as indoctrination. The trou
ble is that most people students
and teacher are too proud in
tellectually to admit it. Instead,
they talk of intellectual independ
ence, academic freedom and ob
jectivity.
Under these principles, a teach
er is supposed to present conflict
ing views fairly and dispassionate
ly, and then the student is expect
ed to compare these ideas and
choose those he considers correct,
without direction from Ids teach
ers.
UNFORTUNATELY, things just
don’t work that way and in fact
could never work that way, be
cause every man who is not hol
low has his own values which
creep through into his teachings
in the subtlest of ways, despite
well-meaning attempts to mini
mize them.
This, of course, assumes intel
lectual integrity on the part of the
teacher. It would seem, however,
that some professors don’t even
try to conceal their value judg
ments.
In the colleges of the nation
where objectivity and intellectual
independence is held up as god,
hypocrisy is rampant. The eco
nomic views of Keynes are taught

as gospel, whle opposing theories
are sketchily presented, scoffed
at, or ignored.
POLITICAL scientists tend to
favor greater centralization of
government, promote the power
of the chief executive at the ex
pense of look for
ward with a contented sigh—-to
the rise of world politcal organi
zation, to the detriment of oppos
ing veiws.

Sociologists are generally bound
together by their contempt of re
ligion as a narcotic of the mind
and are fond of promoting such
social leveling schemes as a 100
per cent inheritance tax.
As evidence that indoctrination
is widespread at Stanford, lot us
consider the following figures.
The Stanford Political Union con
ducted a poll during the 1960 pres
idential election and broke down
the results by classes.

THESE RESULTS showed that
Nixon, who won the poll by 632
votes, drew more votes from
freshmen than from any other
class. Freshmen voted 445 to 193
for Nixon. In stark contrast, grad
uate students, after four years or
more of exposure to the Stanford
educational process, voted 178 to
138 for Kennedy.
The disturbing fact, though, is
not so much that indoctrination
goes on but that the bulk of it
tends in one distinct direction. The
liberal would probably interpret
the foregoing figures by equating
his ideology with intellectualism,
saying perhaps that the philosoph
ical changes were the direct re
sult of successful intellectual en
deavor, the assumption here being
that opposing philosophies are
negated by thoughtful scholar
ship.
SUCH A contention is ridicu
lous. It is sheer bias to believe
that any one philosophy holds a
monopoly on intellectualism; al
most all can gain support from
scholarship.
Realizing that intellectual inde
pendence and objectivity are
worthy but nearly impossible
goals, the University should find
a realistic approach to the prob
lem of one-sided indoctrination.
The simplest plan of action would
be to hire some conservative in
doctrinators to counter the effect
of the liberal indoctrinators. In
the interests of fairness, this plan
should be adopted without delay.
