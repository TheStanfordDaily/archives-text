# Expect Nixon To Toss Hat Into Calif. Ring
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (UPH Cali
fornia’s political pot is reaching
an early boiling point on the big
question mark of Richard M.
Nixon’s plans to seek office.
The former vice president has
scheduled a full dress press con
ference for today at 7 p.m. and
whatever he says will have a large
bearing on the future of the Re
publican party in California
with national repercussions.
MOST OBSERVERS believe that
Nixon will announce his candi
dacy for the governorship of the
nation’s second most populous
state. This job was won in 1958
by Democrat Edmund G. Brown
who drubbed another GOP stal
wart, former Sen. William F.
Knowland, by more than a million
votes.
Nixon has stated that he does
not want to run for governor in
1962. His thinking on this point
is easily explainable even if ho
wins the governorship he must be
counted as a presidential candi
date in 1964.
The 48-year old Californian has
said on several occasions that any
man who runs for governor
should pledge himself to serve the
full four-year term.
Nixon said at a July press con
ference at his home here that he
does not want to run for gover
nor he feels his experience is
on the national and international
level.
HE IMl> stipulate that he would
run for governor if ho felt that he
was the only Republican who
could win the job. And this has
been the argument of state GOP
leaders. Polls have been taken of
Republicans throughout the state
and msults show a heavy majority
feels that Nixon can be the only
successful GOP standard-bearer.
Much is at stake, for if Nixon
loses he faces political oblivion.
