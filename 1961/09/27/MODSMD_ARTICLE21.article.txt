# HUAC Book Digs into Committee
## 
### RON RAPOPORT Associate Editor 
There is probably no better
study to be found of the history,
attitudes and methods of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee than the one written
by Frank J. Donner, “Thfi—Un
recently pub
lished in paperback by Ballantine.
The cost is 60 cents.
Donner’s approach is direct, his
research complete, his conclusions
logical and his point of view fasci
nating.
He presents portraits of most
of the important committee mem
bers of past and present and a
frightening parade of personali
ties it is.
FROM J. Parnell Thomas, who
sent Ring Lardner Jr. to jail for
contempt of Congress and met
him there later when sent up for
taking bribes, to Harold Velde (a
personal favorite) who opposed
mobile libraries in rural areas be
cause he said education is the
fastest way to change social ideas.
Donner lists them. By the time
you get to Francis Walter, you’re
a nervous wreck.
A marvelous chapter on HUAC’s
use of the press convincingly out
lines the way co-operative jour
nals (many of them named in the
book) use scare techniques to
whip up public enthusiasm.
MOST OF the committee’s un
derhanded methods such as issu
ing subpoenas at well-chosen
limes in well-chosen places
(schools for teachers, etc.) are
discussed.
The committee’s browbeating of
witnesses, its insistence on a wit
ness informing on his associates,
its disrespect for a witness’s law
yer (to the extent of later sub
poenaing him for daring to repre
sent an unfriendly witness) and
all its other fascinatingly illegal
methods are presented.
Donner also shows HUAC’s ef
fective use as a clearing house for
many of the hate groups in the
country.
ITS willingness to go after a
witness whom the American Le
gion or the DAR or the Birch So
ciety suspects is described as is its
influence on the FBI to open files
to such organizations.
One of the best parts of the
book is the treatment of the 1960
committee hearings in San Fran
cisco. “Operation Abolition” is

once and for all shown as the
fraud it is (like something out of
Goebbel’s propaganda machine)
and Meisenbach and the J. Edgar
Hoover report are treated fully.

poenaing him for daring to repre
sent an unfriendly witness) and
all its other fascinatingly illegal
methods are presented.
Donner also shows HUAC’s ef
fective use as a clearing house for
many of the hate groups in the
country.
ITS willingness to go after a
witness whom the American Le
gion or the DAR or the Birch So
ciety suspects is described as is its
influence on the FBI to open files
to such organizations.
One of the best parts of the
book is the treatment of the 1960
committee hearings in San Fran
cisco. “Operation Abolition” is

once and for all shown as the
fraud it is (like something out of
Goebbel’s propaganda machine)
and Meisenbach and the J. Edgar
Hoover report are treated fully.
There is probably no better
study to be found of the history,
attitudes and methods of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee than the one written
by Frank J. Donner, “Thfi—Un

The cost is 60 cents.
Donner’s approach is direct, his
research complete, his conclusions
logical and his point of view fasci

He presents portraits of most
of the important committee mem
bers of past and present and a
frightening parade of personali
ties it is.
FROM J. Parnell Thomas, who
sent Ring Lardner Jr. to jail for
contempt of Congress and met
him there later when sent up for
taking bribes, to Harold Velde (a
personal favorite) who opposed
mobile libraries in rural areas be
cause he said education is the
fastest way to change social ideas.
Donner lists them. By the time
you get to Francis Walter, you’re
a nervous wreck.
A marvelous chapter on HUAC’s
use of the press convincingly out
lines the way co-operative jour
nals (many of them named in the
book) use scare techniques to
whip up public enthusiasm.
MOST OF the committee’s un
derhanded methods such as issu
ing subpoenas at well-chosen
limes in well-chosen places
(schools for teachers, etc.) are
discussed.
The committee’s browbeating of
witnesses, its insistence on a wit
ness informing on his associates,
its disrespect for a witness’s law

poenaing him for daring to repre
