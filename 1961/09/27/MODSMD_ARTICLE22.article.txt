# Willi Busch's Private Nightmare —Sons Shooting at Each Other
## 
### 
BERLIN—(UPD—WiIIi Busch
has a private nightmare: his two
sons shooting at each other
across the East-West German
border.

Busch, an elderly chemical
worker, has a teen-age son living
with him at homo in Halle, East
"Germany. His elder son is in
West Germany.
“If my younger son goes into
(he army,” Busch told his fellow
workers, “ho becomes the foe of
his brother who is in the West.”
"A MAN should not allow
that,” he said. “I want to bring
up my son properly and not allow
him to learn murderous crafts.”

Busch told his teen-age son if
he volunteered for the East Ger
man armed forces, “you needn’t
let me see you again.”
For his outspoken views, Busch
was downgraded at an employes
meeting to a low paid job in the
giant Lcu n a chemical factory
where he works in East Ger
many. A Communist army re
serve officer called Busch’s views
“shocking.”
The meeting which condemned
Busch to a low-paid job was only
one of dozens in a Communist
reign of tenor throughout East
Germany’s nationalized ind u s
tries.
THE EAST German press car
ries daily reports of “workers tri
bunals”—kangaroo-courts backed
by the police power of the Red
regime.
A Meissen factory worker iden
tified only as Stein was placed
under arrest by police after a
workers court heard that he at
tacked the factory leadership.
Stein, objecting to cancellation of
a factory outing so that produc
tion quotas could be filled, re
portedly said “whoever cancelled
this outing should be gassed.”
The newspaper Saechsischen
Volkzeitung said a worker named
Herman was put in a low-paid
job for asking for an exit visa
to West Germany unless he re
ceived better housing. The news
paper said Herman also threat
ened to send pictures of his pres
ent housing to West Germany.
