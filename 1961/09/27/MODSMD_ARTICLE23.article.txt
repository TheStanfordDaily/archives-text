# JOURNEY TO CORVALLIS
## Stanford to Test Baker, OSC 
### KEN DERY 
I lie Oregon State Beavers, led by golden boy Terry Baker, and
sporting a T-formation offense for the first time in many years, play
host to Stanford Saturday at Corvallis, Oregon.
The Cards, fresh ofl their first victory after eleven sad outings,
will really have their hands full up North.

THE PRKBSBOOK says that
this could be one of Oregon State’s
best teams ever. After last week’s
powerful showing against mighty
Syracuse (the Beavers lost 19-8,
but gave away the ball on fumbles
twice insirle their own 20-yard
linei it just might bo that the pub
| licity men are right.
The primary reason for all the
! plaudits being heaped on OSC'
comes in a 6-3, 195-pound package
named Terry Baker. Call him a
quarterback or a tailback it’s
all the same. Baker is a terrific
athlete. In fact In high school he
gained all-state honors in both
basketball and baseball as well as
football, in his senior year.
Baker will direct the Beaver
squad, call the plays, and handle
much of the passing, running and
kicking. He made grid history at
OSU last season when, as a soph
omore, he gained 1473 yards rush
ing and passing.
ACTUALLY, insiders believe
that Baker was the one who
forced Beaver coach Tom Prothro,
a dyed-in-the-wool single-wing
man to switch to the T-formation
offense.
Most coaches would love the
problem which beset Prothro. He
laid awake nights trying to figure
| out how best to utilize the talents
of tailbacks Baker and Don Kasso.
Now, with Baker and Kasso run
j ning around at the same time it
must really be a sight to see.
But don’t think that these two
stars will be out there alone on
Saturday. They’ll have hardnosed
Hank Rivera at the other half and
punishing Tom Gates at fullback.
| They can all scoot, and all except
Gates are experienced hands.
Kasso and Rivera both are
senior veterans, while Gates is a
junior college transfer who
I showed all kinds of promise last
spring.
IT'S A FINE starting backfield
: alright, but one which was sup
- posedly lacking in depth. How
! ever, the play of halfbacks Leroy
j Whittle, 6-1,190-pound sophomore,
land Bill Monk, a 5-11, 183-pound
] senior, against Syracuse seems to
I dispell some of the worries.
Whittle, transfer from Santa
Ana JC can blaze. He has a 21.1
clocking to his credit in (he 220-
yard dash. He was a prep team
mate of Kasso at Berkeley.
The line has more depth than
the backfield. The starting ends
are Roger Johnson and Skip Rus
sell, two senior veterans. Both
have Joked good and are intent on j
bowing out with big years.
WHILE (he ends are sufficient,
the tackles represent one of the!
real keys in the Oregon attack.
OSU boasts two of the biggest, |
best and smartest tackles in 1
America,
Mike Kline is 6-0, and 235, while
Neil Plumley is 6-6 and 240. Foot
ball-wise both are plenty good.
Kline was all-coast second team
last year.
They both also shine in the slide j
rule department. They are honor I
students in the school of Business I
& Technology.
MIKE DOLBY and Norby Keo
lanui, two more holdovers, should
start at guard, although George
Gnoss and Ross Cariaga will spell |
them.

quarterback or a tailback it’s

athlete. In fact In high school he
gained all-state honors in both
basketball and baseball as well as

Baker will direct the Beaver
squad, call the plays, and handle
much of the passing, running and
kicking. He made grid history at
OSU last season when, as a soph
omore, he gained 1473 yards rush
ing and passing.
