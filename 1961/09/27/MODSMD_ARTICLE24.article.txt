Editor’s note: This is (he second
in a series of articles introducing:
flic top freshman athletes in each
sport.

“We’ll have a team with the
greatest experience, will, and en
thusiasm, and I wouldn’t trade
it for any other squad in the
country.” That statement came
from the lips of Coach Payton Jor
dan as he summed up the Stan
ford frosh track hopes for 1962.
The frosh team has launched a
PACE program of its own Plan
of Action for Competitive Excel
lence. Surprisingly enough, the
45-man squad finds itself back-to
back with a 1961 team of equal
caliber, so in the next few years
the Cards can anticipate a strong
varsity lineup.
THE TRACKSTKRS, pinpoint
ed as the finest unit ever to reach
the Farm, are also rated with
honors on the national level.
Among them are nine state
champions, three of whom are
nailers. Harlan Andrews of Ore
gon (4:16), Paul Schlicke (4:19.5),
Washington: and Weym Kirkland
(4:19.4), Illinois. Kirkland also
claimed the state championship
title twice in cross-country and
Andrews once in the half-mile
with a 1:58.3).
Other state champs include
Washington prep shot-put king
Jock McLaughlin, who has put the
12-pound shot 60-5%, and Mon
tana's dash and low hurdles
champ Larry Questad. who has a
9.6 100 and 21 flat 220 to his
credit. His top mark in the 180-
yard low hurdles is 19.6.
IN THE QUARTER the Pa
pooses will have two state cham
pions in Bob Mclntyre (48.9) of
Oregon and Lou Moench (49.5)
of Utah. “Skip” Amos of Long
Beach will add strength here with
a best of 49.1.
Of the candidates reporting for j
fall (raining one prospect hails
from abroad. Lome Peterson, in
ter scholastic shot-put champ from
British Columbia, Canada, who |
has a best of 48.2 and a 142-2
mark in the discus. Backing Peter
son up is Mark Kryder of Oregon
whose best is 170.6 with the light
er prep discus.
Other outstanding prospects in
clude:
• Craig Taylor. Dana Point, ;
Calif.; 50.5 quarter and 1:58.8
half.
• Russ Peterson, Arlington,
Va.; 23-0 broad jump and 50.9
quarter.
•Phil Arnaudo, Mountain
View. Calif.; 14.8 high hurdles,
19,8 lows.
• Jack Chappie, Coronado and
New Mexico Institute; 62-Ihigh
school shot,
• Steve Hobson, Garden Grove,
Calif.; 1:57 half.
•Pat McKenna, Kirkland,
Wash.; 51 flat quarter.
• Dave Steinbeck, Glen Ellen,
111.; second to Kirkland in the
slate mile championships at 4:19.5
and second again in cross-country.
Field events next season, as in
past years, will suffer setbacks in
high jump and pole vault. Only
one high jumper has reported and
there are NO pole vaulters.
“This is the type of team which
no single person can carry; with
the potential and know-how they
possess and enough drive they can
even go beyond all expectations,”
Jordan enthused.
