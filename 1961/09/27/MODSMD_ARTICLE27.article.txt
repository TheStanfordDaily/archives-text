NEW YORK (UPIt — Roger
Maris hit his 60th home run last
night, equalling Babe Ruth’s all
time high for a single season and
touching off a general controversy
as to whether he can rightfully
claim a share of baseball’s most
famous record.
Maris’ homer came off Jack
Fisher in the third inning of a
game between the New York
Yankees and Baltimore Orioles,
the ball travelling approximately
375 feet and landing in the lower
light field stands where dozens of
fans scrambled excitedly for the
prized souvenir.

THE BLOW was struck in the
Yankees’ 158th game- four games
past the deadline imposed by Com
missioner Ford Frick for “offici
ally” tying Ruth’s record of 1927.
But that didn’t matter to a
frenzied crowd of nearly 25,000
which thundered down an ovation
upon the beaming 27-year-old
Maris such as has been rarely
heard before in the 39-year his
tory of Yankee Stadium.
Maris, who hit his homer on a
2 and 2 pitch, circled the bases
slowly with a big grin on his face.
Third-base Coach Frank Crosetti
patted him on the back as he
rounded third and Maris did a
semi-jig the last 75 feet to the

plate.
Ed Hurley, umpiring at first
base, pointed toward the left field
stands clearly signifying the ball
was fair by approximately five
feet.

BALTIMORE right-fielder Earl
Robinson retrieved the homer and
tossed the ball to Hurley, who in
turn threw it into the Yankees’
dugout.
Even after he hit the ball, Maris
stood half transfixed at home
plate and watched the flight of the
ball as the crowd roared in ap
proval. When he had completed
his tour of the bases, and Hector
Lopez was scheduled to be the
next batter, the crowd set up such
a din that the game was held up
until Maris came back out of the
Yankee dugout and tipped his cap
to the applauding crowd.


ROGER MARIS
He got the "big one"
