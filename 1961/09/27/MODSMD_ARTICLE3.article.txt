# Telescope Dish Rise Set Today
## 
### 
America’s biggest radio tele
scope “dish” was scheduled to go
up on campus this morning at 5.
Riggers wore to lift the 70-ton,
150-foot steel-and-aluminum pa
rabolic antenna onto its mount
before the wind came up. If con
ditions were not right, the opera
tion was to be postponed on a day
to day basis.

The Stanford dish, designed and
built by Stanford Research Insti
tute scientists under support of
the Air Force Office of Aerospace
Research and the Defense Atomic
Support Agency, is the first of
three SRI radio telescopes in the
U.S.

Beside the Stanford dish stands
a huge 20-55 megacycle radio
transmitter operated by Univer
sity scientists, with a radar probe
to explore the sun, moon and in
terplanetary gases.

Mounted, the near-half-acre
aluminum mesh surface of the
dish will stand 160 feet at its
highest and can point to any sec
tor of the heavens. Because of the
joint SRI-Stanford project’s im
portance to radio and radar as
tronomy, Stanford trustees passed
a special resolution exempting it
from their long-standing ban on
visible structures among the Uni
versity's foothills.
