# Late Leave System Altered for Women
## 
### SHERRY WELCH Managing Editor 
Demerits and 1 ;30 late loaves
have been abolished, dorm closing
hours extended to midnight, and
a now 12 o’clock late leave given
the freshmen in an attempt to
give the women students more in
dividual and group responsibility
in the face of their social regula
tions.

The women’s social regulations
are a concrete application of the
Fundamental Standard. Their
main purpose as conceived by the
Social Regulations Committee is
to “provide a basis of regular pro
cedure through which social ma
turity may be developed.” An es
sential element of the system is
“freedom of decision within a
framework of individual and
group responsibility.”
DEAN OF WOMEN Lucille Al
len says. “Regulations are some
thing which the girls probably
really want, the University seems
to want and which society feels
necessary. The regulations are
much more liberal here than in
most graduate institutions with
which I have had contact. This
means an added responsibility for
the woman which if she is not
ready to accept could lead to dif
ficulty. but which if she is ready
to accept could lead to her de
veloping much more rapidly the
ability to make mature decisions.”

UNDER THE NEW regulations,
all freshmen residences will con
tinue to close at 10:30 p.m. Sun
day through Thursday and at mid
night Friday and Saturday but
upperclass residences will close
at midnight every night. The
switchboards in all dorms will
still close at 10:30 p.m., and the
women in each house may deter
mine whether or not their lobby
will be open to men during the
period from 10:30 to midnight.
What the new regulations do
mean is that no girl has to take a
late leave unless she intends to
stay out past midnight, although
for their own benefit all women
are advised to sign out if they are
leaving the residence after dinner.
THE DISTRIBUTION of late
leaves has also been changed.
Whereas the freshmen used to be
entitled to 25 l:3o’s six of which
could be 2:3o’s, under the new

system they are given 16 2:30’,s
and one 12 o’clock per week.

The 12 o’clock late leave is an
innovation to enable the student
to take better advantage of the
cultural and academic opportuni
ties in the area. Also since the
closing hours of the Library were
extended from 10 to 11 p.m. last
year, the freshmen may now stay
and study until closing time with
out having to sign out.

The 1:30 late leave has been
abolished both for greater simpli
fication of the rules, and to give
more responsibility to the girl in
her decision as to when she should
be in. Formerly when a woman
was given l:3o’s and 2:3o’s the
conception seemed to bo that she
should stay out to the limit of her
late leave. Now if she only wants
to stay out until 12:30 she must
still take a 2:30. It also eliminates
the problems which arose when
an upperclass woman was doubl
ing with a freshman who had to
be in an hour earlier than she did.
THIRD QUARTER freshmen

are entitled to IS 2:30 late leaves.
Sophomores have a total quota of
35, and juniors and seniors as pre
viously have unlimited 2:30 late
leaves.
The demerit system has also
been abolished and replaced by a
system of auxiliary committees,
one for each women’s living
group.
When a woman incurs a viola
tion, a representative from this
committee will speak with her.
If continual violations occur on
the part of the women, she will
come up before the auxiliary com
mittee for her living area. A wom
en’s Council representative sits
in on each auxiliary committee,
and if any case looks as if it might
involve a possible Fundamental
Standard violation she sees that
it is referred to the council.
FOR THK FIRST time this year,
men may also be brought up be
fore a Men’s Council on the basis
that they have been responsible
for a women’s violation, if for in
stance they have made it impos
sible for her to return to her dorm
before her late leave has expired.
Although demerits themselves
no longer exist, a general record
of any violations incurred under
the old system is being kept on the
files.
For several years the Social
Regulations Committee has been
working on the revision of the
system. This year under the
guardianship of Linda Gogins,
President of AWS, Gretchen Weit
mann, Chairman of Women’s
Council and Judy Wilson chair
man of the Social Regulations
Committee with the support of
Dean Allen they are being put into
effect.
THK NEW SIGN-OUT card sys
tem, which the women found upon
entering their dorms this week, is
the result of work by Margaret
Turkel, a member of the Social
Regulations Committee, who was
inspired to investigate the possi
bility of revamping the old system
by Miss Chenoweth, former Direc
tor of Lagunita.
It cost $9OO to install the new
system of more permanent sign
out cards. Previously, however, it
cost approximately $7OO annually
to maintain the system, and be
cause many of the cards and slips
formerly necessary have been
eliminated the new system should
not cost more than $2OO per year.
, The new card system is here to
stay, but the auxiliary committee
■system, (he extended closing
hours, and the now system of laic
leaves are all on trial, scheduled
to lapse at the end of the year
when a vote will be taken among
the women on campus as to
whether the system should be
continued.

In the meantime, Judy Wilson
and the Social Regulations Com
mittee are anxious to hoar any
complaints, suggestions, or praises
of the new system which any
Stanford students, men or women,
have during the year.
