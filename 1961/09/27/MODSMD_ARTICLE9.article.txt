# Speech Group Meets Tonight
## 
### 
SUidont Body President Bob
Sayler a three year veteran of the
Stanford debate squad will head
line the program at this year’s
first meeting of the Stanford
Speech Association to be held to
night at 7:30 p.m. at Bowman
Alumni House.

Freshmen and upperclassmen,
both those with speaking talent
and those who merely like to talk,
will be welcome at the open meet
ing. Speech Association President
Mike Hall emphasizes that no ex
perience is necessary, as almost
all tournaments provide separate
categories so that novices will not
be thrown against slick-talking
veterans.

Hall also remarked that girl de
baters need not fear being forced
to compete against the stronger
sex. While the Stanford entries in
women’s division have always
been of a high caliber, in the past
there has been a numerical short
age on the distaff side of the
squad; thus girls are especially
encouraged to participate.
