Our job is providing communications
of all kinds, wherever needed —whether
in the northern snows to flash word of
possible enemy missile attack, or in your
home or college, or in serving the
nation’s business.
When we can’t fill a need off the shelf,
then we start fresh and create the answer
to the problem. We’ve done that hun
dreds of times.
We began transatlantic radiotelephone
service in 1927. Then we developed the
world’s first undersea telephone cables
to speed calls between continents.
We handled the world's first telephone
conversation via satellite. And we have
started development of an important
world-wide communications system em
ploying satellites.
When industry and government needed
away of gathering huge amounts of
coded information from distant points,
we were ready with our vast telephone
network and Data-Phone, which can
transmit mountains of data at extremely
high speeds.
And so it goes—Long Distance service,
Direct Distance Dialing, the Transistor,
the Solar Battery—a succession of firsts
which goes back to the invention of the
telephone itself.
Universal communications-the finest,
most dependable anywhere—are what we
deliver. Inside: for home, office, or plant.
Outside; on land, under the sea, through
the air, or into space.
