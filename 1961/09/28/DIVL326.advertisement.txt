support
C’mon, Rich! You’re rationaliz
ing. Jockey support 1 might never
have secured you against the
Emperor-. Bui it certainly would
have provided snug protection
against the physical stiesses and
strains of your active life. Your
armorer never tailored a coat of
mail more knowingly than Jockey
tailors a brief—from 13 separate,
body-conforming pieces.
1. Other “ imitation " briefs (copies of the
oriHinat Jockey brand) hare no more
Jockey support than a limp loin cloth.
2. Richard the Lion-Hearted. 1157-99,
surrendered England and a huge ransom
to secure his release from Henry VI.
Gel the real thing. Look for
the name JOCktHf on the waist band
