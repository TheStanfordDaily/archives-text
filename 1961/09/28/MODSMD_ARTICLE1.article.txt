# Congress Approves Linear Accelerator
## 
### 
A tentative schedule for project M, the linear accelerator to be
constructed off Sand Hill Road, has been announced following
I uesday’s congressional approval of the $ll4 million project.
"Hie $30.5 million appropriation allotted for the first year in
cludes $26 million for construction and $45 million for research.

Farm officials place the begin
ning of construction early next
year. First buildings will be a
test laboratory, an administra
tion-engineering building and a
central laboratory to house re
search personnel. The test labo
ratory, due for completion by the
summer of 1963, will be used to
test component parts of the ac
celerator.
The administration-engineering
building is expected to be com
pleted in the spring of 1963 and
completion of the central labora
tory building will follow in the
fall of 1963.
JANUARY of 1963 will mark
the beginning of work on the two
mile underground tunnel. This
phase of the project is expected
to reach completion bv spring of
1964.
The staff of the facility will
number 750 when the project is
completed in 1966. Officials hope
to have 90 per cent of the staff
on the job by fall of 1963.
Wolfgang Panofsky, head of
the project with Edward L. Ginz
ton, saw the project as a chal
lenge to “Stanford’s ability to
construct and operate this impor
tant new research instrument.”
“ALTHOUGH the annual con
struction and operational cost of
the accelerator are comparable to
the yearly budget of Stanford
University ($3B million), we are
confident the project can be com
bined successfully with the pri
mary functions of the University
in teaching and research,” Panof
sky said. He expressed the feeling
that the close relationship be
tween the accelerator staff and
the faculty and student body
“should be of great value to
both.”
He expressed gratitude to the
government “for the confidence
it has shown in Stanford’s abil
ity.”

fall of 1963.
JANUARY of 1963 will mark
the beginning of work on the two
mile underground tunnel. This
phase of the project is expected
to reach completion bv spring of
1964.
The staff of the facility will
number 750 when the project is
completed in 1966. Officials hope
to have 90 per cent of the staff
on the job by fall of 1963.
Wolfgang Panofsky, head of
the project with Edward L. Ginz
ton, saw the project as a chal
lenge to “Stanford’s ability to
construct and operate this impor
tant new research instrument.”
“ALTHOUGH the annual con
struction and operational cost of
the accelerator are comparable to
the yearly budget of Stanford
University ($3B million), we are
confident the project can be com
bined successfully with the pri
mary functions of the University
in teaching and research,” Panof
sky said. He expressed the feeling
that the close relationship be
tween the accelerator staff and
the faculty and student body
“should be of great value to
both.”
He expressed gratitude to the
government “for the confidence
it has shown in Stanford’s abil
ity.”
