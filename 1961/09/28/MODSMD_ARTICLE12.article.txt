### BULLETIN 
BEIRUT. Lebanon (UPI)
Damascus Radio announced early
today that a military coup had
seized control of the Syrian region
of the United Arab Republic.
The move apparently was aimed
at breaking up Syria’s three and
a half year old union with Egypt.
The Damascus Radio announcer
appealed for calm.
The broadcast said three army
groups were involved in the coup.
(In Tunisia, the Tunis Radio
said United Arab Republic Presi
dent Gamal Abdel Nasser had an
nounced over Cairo Radio that an
“insurrection movement” had
broken out in the Syrian region.)
Damascus Radio said the army
had revolted against “those who
mistreated citizens and misused
the powers of their positions for
their own benefits.
The broadcast of “communique
No. 1” was signed by the “Arab
Revolutionary Supreme Com
mand."
“To Arabs everywhere,” it said,
“We exhausted every peaceful
means with the criminal group
who were in power to improve
conditions but had to use force
finally.
“Trust your armed forces and
God is great and glory for Arabs.”
The revolt came on the heels of
the resignation of Syrian strong
man Lt. Col. Abdel Hamid Serraj
as vice president for internal af
fairs of the UAR.
Serraj’s resignation was an
nounced in Cairo Tuesday and he
was reported to have loft there
immediately for Damascus.
Serraj was reported to have felt
he had been given only a figure
head post in the UAR.
Serraj was said to have dis
puted with Field Marshal Abdel
Hakim Amer, commander of the
UAR's armed forces and a close
aide of President Nasser, on the
handling of Syria’s affairs.
