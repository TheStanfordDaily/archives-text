# Hammarskjold and World Government
## 
### 
Dag Hammarskjold, a symbol of world peace, will be buried in
his native Sweden tomorrow, and the world might well ponder
whether chances for world peace will be buried with him.
In a very real sense, the Secretary General’s death was not only
a personal tragedy but a tragedy for the earth’s population, whose
leaders have a dismal record in the making and keeping of the
peace. Certainly the hundreds of millions in the underdeveloped
nations had no better or more trustworthy friend and spokesman
than the great Swede. A man of his stature, his stamina, his total
dedication to bringing a lasting peace to an insane world has not
appeared to take his place and it seems unlikely that one will.
Whether the organization he served will endure is not certain.
An observer watching mankind would undoubtedly find it aston
ishing and incomprehensible that the only organization dedicated
to man’s noblest ambitions—and the only hope of humans for a last
ing peace—is in imminent danger of being torn down and smashed
to rubble.
As Walter Lippmann points out, Dag Hammarskjold very likely
was a man of the future—a man out of place in this age. He was a
man who stood for a world of peace guided by an international or
ganization in which all nations had equal voices and votes. He was
an irreplaceable man.
Hammarskjold’s passing has spurred discussion on the U.N. and
its effectiveness—its desireability, even.
It seems to us that the events of the 20th Century have proved
that a world of completely independent nations, with the larger
ones subduing the smaller ones and groups banding together against
other groups to advance various nationalistic aims, has its obvious
drawbacks.
With four nations possessing nuclear weapons and others ready
to within the decade, the human race—if it wants to survive—can
no longer afford a world of nations each determined to go its own
way.
World government, under international law which can be en
forced, appears to be the only solution which can permanently keep
the world from blowing up in our faces in our 8 o’clock classes to
morrow.
It is our belief that world government could function efficiently
without unduly interfering with domestic affairs of nations and
would not smother national traditions and differences. We prefer
it and peace to the present situation, which quite possibly will find
us all vanishing in a mushroom-shaped cloud—independently.

An observer watching mankind would undoubtedly find it aston
ishing and incomprehensible that the only organization dedicated
to man’s noblest ambitions—and the only hope of humans for a last
ing peace—is in imminent danger of being torn down and smashed
to rubble.
As Walter Lippmann points out, Dag Hammarskjold very likely
was a man of the future—a man out of place in this age. He was a
man who stood for a world of peace guided by an international or
ganization in which all nations had equal voices and votes. He was
an irreplaceable man.
Hammarskjold’s passing has spurred discussion on the U.N. and
its effectiveness—its desireability, even.
It seems to us that the events of the 20th Century have proved
that a world of completely independent nations, with the larger
ones subduing the smaller ones and groups banding together against
other groups to advance various nationalistic aims, has its obvious
drawbacks.
With four nations possessing nuclear weapons and others ready
to within the decade, the human race—if it wants to survive—can
no longer afford a world of nations each determined to go its own
way.
World government, under international law which can be en
forced, appears to be the only solution which can permanently keep
the world from blowing up in our faces in our 8 o’clock classes to
morrow.
It is our belief that world government could function efficiently
without unduly interfering with domestic affairs of nations and
would not smother national traditions and differences. We prefer
it and peace to the present situation, which quite possibly will find
us all vanishing in a mushroom-shaped cloud—independently.
Dag Hammarskjold, a symbol of world peace, will be buried in
his native Sweden tomorrow, and the world might well ponder
whether chances for world peace will be buried with him.
In a very real sense, the Secretary General’s death was not only
a personal tragedy but a tragedy for the earth’s population, whose
leaders have a dismal record in the making and keeping of the
peace. Certainly the hundreds of millions in the underdeveloped
nations had no better or more trustworthy friend and spokesman
than the great Swede. A man of his stature, his stamina, his total
dedication to bringing a lasting peace to an insane world has not
appeared to take his place and it seems unlikely that one will.
Whether the organization he served will endure is not certain.
