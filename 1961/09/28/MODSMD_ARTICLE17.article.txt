# New Surgery Technique
## 
### 
Surgeons at Stanford’s School
of Medicine have developed a
“dry” brain surgery technique
which will permit some hitherto
impossible operations.
They cut off the blood supply to
a woman’s brain for 10 minutes
last week enabling them to reach
an otherwise inaccessible tumor.
The brain was cooled by circu
lating the blood through an ex
ternal cooling mechanism and let
ting it flow back to the brain with
a resulting reduction in tempera
ture, the University said yester

day.
The process cooled the brain
from its normal 98.6 degrees to
about 68 degrees, a “hibernation
stage” where it doesn’t require
blood or oxygen.
With the arteries clamped off
surgeons then had a dry field on
which to work, reaching areas
that until now have been too ob
scured by the flow of blood for
successful surgery.
The technique will permit the
brain to be without blood for up to
an hour, the University said,

whereas formerly severe brain
damage or death resulted if oxy
gen was cut off for more than
four or five minutes.
The research and surgical team
was headed by Dr. John E. Con
nolly, working with Drs. Robert
Boyd, James Calvin and Robert
Michelson.
