## On Hammarskjold 
### 
Over the years I have often
wondered whether Dag Hammar
skjold belonged to an age that is
passing or to one that is being
born.
He was a bold innovator in
world affairs, and he opened up a
future, having carried further
than it has ever been carried be
fore the principle of international
action to promote peace. Yet he
was himself the fine flower of the
European tradition of civility
which, if it is not dying, certainly
is not flourishing today.
He was altogether not the mass
man of our times. He could be a
very good friend, but there was a
deep reserve in his character
which few if any can have pene
trated.
IN THE great public world
where the white lights blazed up
on him, he lived an inner life of
contemplation and esthetic experi
ence.
His diplomacy had a finesse and
a courtliness in the great tradi
tions of Europe. Never before, and
perhaps never again, has any man
used the intense art of diplomacy
for such unconventional and such
novel experiments.
The biggest experiment, for
which in the end he gave his life,
was to move the international so
ciety of the United Nations from
having to choose between a very
difficult police action in Korea
and sole reliance on debate and
verbal expression.
HE MOVED the U.N. onto the
plane of executive action without
large-scale war as in Korea.
This movement from words to
deeds, from general resolutions to
intervention, was best seen during
the crisis at Suez, in Palestine, in
Laos, and then in the enormous,
the infinitely difficult and the in
finitely dangerous crisis in the
Congo.
I knew Dag Hammarskjold long
enough and well enough, I think,
to understand why he accepted the
risks of opening up new paths in
such wild and uncharted country.
He was not an innovator be
cause he had an itch to change
things. He was a political inno
vator because there was no decent
alternative. He saw no alternative
to intervention by the United Na
tions in a crisis where there was
a bitter confrontation in the cold
war.
NO CAUTIOUS and timid man
would have dreamed of staking
the prestige and perhaps the fu
ture of the United Nations, as well
as his personal reputation and his
office, on the attempt to pacify
the Congo.
But great as were the risks of
intervention, the risks of letting
events run their course were
much greater. If the United Na
tions now fails in what Hammar
skjold inaugurated, the prospects
are that the terrible racial strug
gle between Europeans and Afri
cans will become deeply entangled
in the conflict between the West
ern powers and the Communist
powers of the Soviet Union and
China.
It was to avert and to prevent
this fatal entanglement that Ham
marskjold dared to use the powers
of the United Nations. The out
come is as yet unknown.
BUT WHAT we do know is that
his unprecedented innovation in
world affairs has run into fearful
resistance both in the East and in
the West. Hammarskj old’s use of
the U.N. to isolate and disinfect
the Congo crisis brought on him
and the U.N. the implacable ha
tred of the Soviet government.
At the same time Hammar
skjold did not have the full sup
port of the Western powers. In
Algeria, in Katanga, in Angola, in
Rhodesia, and in South Africa
there is bitter resistance to the ob
jectives of the United Nations in
the Congo.
Those objectives are to protect
the transition from white suprem
acy, which cannot be continued
much longer, to African self-gov
ernment, for which the Africans
are so unprepared.
THERE IS NO doubt that in
the administration of the now
U.N. policy there have been mis
takes. errors of judgment and
failures of personnel.
But let us keep it in mind that
the cause of the two-sided opposi
tion to the U.N. action is not the
mistakes, which are not irrepar
able. The cause of the opposition
from East and West is a deter
mination not to have the U.N. suc
ceed in what it is attempting to
do. For if the U.N. succeeds, there
will not be a Communist govern

merit in the Congo.
That is what Khrushchev hates
about Hammarskjold and the Sec
retary General’s office. And if the
U.N. succeeds, there will not be a
restoration of white supremacy
in the Congo, and that is why
money, propaganda, and clandes
tine intervention are being em
ployed to frustrate the U.N.
NO ONE KNOWS today who
can come after Hammarskjold,
and there are many signs that he
is in fact irreplaceable. For Ham
marskjold was made Secretary
General at a time when the U.N.
was really no more than a debat
ing society. Except for the police
action in Korea it passed resolu
tions which aimed at mediation
and conciliation, hut it did not in
any important place command ex
ecutive action.
It is easy to say that the world
is not ready for international ac
tion to establish peace, and it
would be hard to refute such a
statement.
Hammarskjold, under the fear
ful pressure of circumstances, re
sorted to international action.
With his extraordinary diplomatic
elegance and finesse, he used suc
cessfully international action at
Suez, in Palestine and in Laos. As
compared with these the Congo
presented a new order of diffi
culty, and the outcome, now that
Hammarskjold is dead, is in the
gravest doubt.
IF THE WORLD is not ready
for what Hammarskjold felt com
pelled to try in the Congo, it is
also true, I hate to say. that this
present world is not ready for the
kind of man Hammarskjold was.
He was a Western man in the
highest traditions of political ex
cellence in the West.
Khrushchev says that Hammar
skjold was not neutral in the Con
go, and that there is no such thing
as a neutral man. Hammarskjold
was in fact the embodiment of the
noblest Western political achieve
ment that laws can be adminis
tered by judges and civil servants
who have their first allegiance to
the laws, and not to their personal,
their class, or even their national
interests.

No such political ideal is be
lieved to he possible or is regarded
as tolerable in the Marxist world.
The ideal is not very well under
stood in most of the rest of the
world, and there is no use pretend
ing that such public servants are
not very rare indeed. So there are
times, as now in this hour of our
grief and shock, when the ideal
seems to belong to things that are
passing away.

can come after Hammarskjold,

marskjold was made Secretary
General at a time when the U.N.
was really no more than a debat

action in Korea it passed resolu

It is easy to say that the world
is not ready for international ac

would be hard to refute such a

Hammarskjold, under the fear

sorted to international action.
With his extraordinary diplomatic
elegance and finesse, he used suc

presented a new order of diffi

Hammarskjold is dead, is in the

IF THE WORLD is not ready

He was a Western man in the
highest traditions of political ex

Khrushchev says that Hammar
skjold was not neutral in the Con
go, and that there is no such thing
as a neutral man. Hammarskjold
was in fact the embodiment of the
noblest Western political achieve
ment that laws can be adminis

who have their first allegiance to
the laws, and not to their personal,
their class, or even their national
interests.

No such political ideal is be
lieved to he possible or is regarded
as tolerable in the Marxist world.
The ideal is not very well under

not very rare indeed. So there are

Over the years I have often
wondered whether Dag Hammar
skjold belonged to an age that is
passing or to one that is being
born.
He was a bold innovator in
world affairs, and he opened up a
future, having carried further
than it has ever been carried be
fore the principle of international
action to promote peace. Yet he
was himself the fine flower of the
European tradition of civility
which, if it is not dying, certainly
is not flourishing today.
He was altogether not the mass
man of our times. He could be a
very good friend, but there was a
deep reserve in his character
which few if any can have pene
trated.
IN THE great public world
where the white lights blazed up
on him, he lived an inner life of
contemplation and esthetic experi
ence.
His diplomacy had a finesse and
a courtliness in the great tradi
tions of Europe. Never before, and
perhaps never again, has any man
used the intense art of diplomacy
for such unconventional and such
novel experiments.
The biggest experiment, for
which in the end he gave his life,
was to move the international so
ciety of the United Nations from
having to choose between a very
difficult police action in Korea
and sole reliance on debate and
verbal expression.
HE MOVED the U.N. onto the
plane of executive action without
large-scale war as in Korea.
This movement from words to
deeds, from general resolutions to
intervention, was best seen during
the crisis at Suez, in Palestine, in
Laos, and then in the enormous,
the infinitely difficult and the in
finitely dangerous crisis in the
Congo.
I knew Dag Hammarskjold long
enough and well enough, I think,
to understand why he accepted the
risks of opening up new paths in
such wild and uncharted country.
He was not an innovator be
cause he had an itch to change
things. He was a political inno
vator because there was no decent
alternative. He saw no alternative
to intervention by the United Na
tions in a crisis where there was
a bitter confrontation in the cold
war.
NO CAUTIOUS and timid man
would have dreamed of staking
the prestige and perhaps the fu
ture of the United Nations, as well
as his personal reputation and his
office, on the attempt to pacify
the Congo.
But great as were the risks of
intervention, the risks of letting
events run their course were
much greater. If the United Na
tions now fails in what Hammar
skjold inaugurated, the prospects
are that the terrible racial strug
gle between Europeans and Afri
cans will become deeply entangled
in the conflict between the West
ern powers and the Communist
powers of the Soviet Union and
China.
It was to avert and to prevent
this fatal entanglement that Ham
marskjold dared to use the powers
of the United Nations. The out
come is as yet unknown.
BUT WHAT we do know is that
his unprecedented innovation in
world affairs has run into fearful
resistance both in the East and in
the West. Hammarskj old’s use of
the U.N. to isolate and disinfect
the Congo crisis brought on him
and the U.N. the implacable ha
tred of the Soviet government.
At the same time Hammar
skjold did not have the full sup
port of the Western powers. In
Algeria, in Katanga, in Angola, in
Rhodesia, and in South Africa
there is bitter resistance to the ob
jectives of the United Nations in
the Congo.
Those objectives are to protect
the transition from white suprem
acy, which cannot be continued
much longer, to African self-gov
ernment, for which the Africans
are so unprepared.
THERE IS NO doubt that in
the administration of the now
U.N. policy there have been mis
takes. errors of judgment and
failures of personnel.
But let us keep it in mind that
the cause of the two-sided opposi
tion to the U.N. action is not the
mistakes, which are not irrepar
able. The cause of the opposition
from East and West is a deter
mination not to have the U.N. suc
ceed in what it is attempting to
do. For if the U.N. succeeds, there
will not be a Communist govern

merit in the Congo.
That is what Khrushchev hates
about Hammarskjold and the Sec
retary General’s office. And if the
U.N. succeeds, there will not be a
restoration of white supremacy
in the Congo, and that is why
money, propaganda, and clandes
tine intervention are being em
ployed to frustrate the U.N.

events run their course were
much greater. If the United Na
tions now fails in what Hammar
skjold inaugurated, the prospects
are that the terrible racial strug
gle between Europeans and Afri
cans will become deeply entangled
in the conflict between the West
ern powers and the Communist
powers of the Soviet Union and
China.
It was to avert and to prevent
this fatal entanglement that Ham
marskjold dared to use the powers
of the United Nations. The out
come is as yet unknown.
BUT WHAT we do know is that
his unprecedented innovation in
world affairs has run into fearful
resistance both in the East and in
the West. Hammarskj old’s use of
the U.N. to isolate and disinfect
the Congo crisis brought on him
and the U.N. the implacable ha
tred of the Soviet government.
At the same time Hammar
skjold did not have the full sup
port of the Western powers. In
Algeria, in Katanga, in Angola, in
Rhodesia, and in South Africa
there is bitter resistance to the ob
jectives of the United Nations in
the Congo.
Those objectives are to protect
the transition from white suprem
acy, which cannot be continued
much longer, to African self-gov
ernment, for which the Africans
are so unprepared.
THERE IS NO doubt that in
the administration of the now
U.N. policy there have been mis
takes. errors of judgment and
failures of personnel.
But let us keep it in mind that
the cause of the two-sided opposi
tion to the U.N. action is not the
mistakes, which are not irrepar
able. The cause of the opposition
from East and West is a deter
mination not to have the U.N. suc
ceed in what it is attempting to
do. For if the U.N. succeeds, there
will not be a Communist govern

merit in the Congo.
That is what Khrushchev hates
about Hammarskjold and the Sec
retary General’s office. And if the
U.N. succeeds, there will not be a
restoration of white supremacy
in the Congo, and that is why
money, propaganda, and clandes
tine intervention are being em
ployed to frustrate the U.N.
NO ONE KNOWS today who
can come after Hammarskjold,
and there are many signs that he
is in fact irreplaceable. For Ham
marskjold was made Secretary
General at a time when the U.N.
was really no more than a debat
ing society. Except for the police
action in Korea it passed resolu
tions which aimed at mediation
and conciliation, hut it did not in
any important place command ex
ecutive action.
It is easy to say that the world
is not ready for international ac
tion to establish peace, and it
would be hard to refute such a
statement.
Hammarskjold, under the fear
ful pressure of circumstances, re
sorted to international action.
With his extraordinary diplomatic
elegance and finesse, he used suc
cessfully international action at
Suez, in Palestine and in Laos. As
compared with these the Congo
presented a new order of diffi
culty, and the outcome, now that
Hammarskjold is dead, is in the
gravest doubt.
IF THE WORLD is not ready
for what Hammarskjold felt com
pelled to try in the Congo, it is
also true, I hate to say. that this
present world is not ready for the
kind of man Hammarskjold was.
He was a Western man in the
highest traditions of political ex
cellence in the West.
Khrushchev says that Hammar
skjold was not neutral in the Con
go, and that there is no such thing
as a neutral man. Hammarskjold
was in fact the embodiment of the
noblest Western political achieve
ment that laws can be adminis
tered by judges and civil servants
who have their first allegiance to
the laws, and not to their personal,
their class, or even their national
interests.

No such political ideal is be
lieved to he possible or is regarded
as tolerable in the Marxist world.
The ideal is not very well under
stood in most of the rest of the
world, and there is no use pretend
ing that such public servants are
not very rare indeed. So there are
times, as now in this hour of our
grief and shock, when the ideal
seems to belong to things that are

Over the years I have often
wondered whether Dag Hammar
skjold belonged to an age that is
passing or to one that is being
born.
He was a bold innovator in
world affairs, and he opened up a
future, having carried further
than it has ever been carried be
fore the principle of international
action to promote peace. Yet he
was himself the fine flower of the
European tradition of civility
which, if it is not dying, certainly
is not flourishing today.
He was altogether not the mass
man of our times. He could be a
very good friend, but there was a
deep reserve in his character
which few if any can have pene
trated.
IN THE great public world
where the white lights blazed up
on him, he lived an inner life of
contemplation and esthetic experi
ence.
His diplomacy had a finesse and
a courtliness in the great tradi
tions of Europe. Never before, and
perhaps never again, has any man
used the intense art of diplomacy
for such unconventional and such
novel experiments.
The biggest experiment, for
which in the end he gave his life,
was to move the international so
ciety of the United Nations from
having to choose between a very
difficult police action in Korea
and sole reliance on debate and
verbal expression.
HE MOVED the U.N. onto the
plane of executive action without
large-scale war as in Korea.
This movement from words to
deeds, from general resolutions to
intervention, was best seen during
the crisis at Suez, in Palestine, in
Laos, and then in the enormous,
the infinitely difficult and the in
finitely dangerous crisis in the
Congo.
I knew Dag Hammarskjold long
enough and well enough, I think,
to understand why he accepted the
risks of opening up new paths in
such wild and uncharted country.
He was not an innovator be
cause he had an itch to change
things. He was a political inno
vator because there was no decent
alternative. He saw no alternative
to intervention by the United Na
tions in a crisis where there was
a bitter confrontation in the cold
war.
NO CAUTIOUS and timid man
would have dreamed of staking
the prestige and perhaps the fu
ture of the United Nations, as well
as his personal reputation and his
office, on the attempt to pacify
the Congo.
But great as were the risks of

world affairs, and he opened up a
future, having carried further
than it has ever been carried be
fore the principle of international
action to promote peace. Yet he
was himself the fine flower of the
European tradition of civility
which, if it is not dying, certainly
is not flourishing today.
He was altogether not the mass
man of our times. He could be a
very good friend, but there was a
deep reserve in his character
which few if any can have pene
trated.
IN THE great public world
where the white lights blazed up
on him, he lived an inner life of
contemplation and esthetic experi
ence.
His diplomacy had a finesse and
a courtliness in the great tradi
tions of Europe. Never before, and
perhaps never again, has any man
used the intense art of diplomacy
for such unconventional and such
novel experiments.
The biggest experiment, for
which in the end he gave his life,
was to move the international so
ciety of the United Nations from
having to choose between a very
difficult police action in Korea
and sole reliance on debate and
verbal expression.
HE MOVED the U.N. onto the
plane of executive action without
large-scale war as in Korea.
This movement from words to
deeds, from general resolutions to
intervention, was best seen during
the crisis at Suez, in Palestine, in
Laos, and then in the enormous,
the infinitely difficult and the in
finitely dangerous crisis in the
Congo.
I knew Dag Hammarskjold long
enough and well enough, I think,
to understand why he accepted the
risks of opening up new paths in
such wild and uncharted country.
He was not an innovator be
cause he had an itch to change
things. He was a political inno
vator because there was no decent
alternative. He saw no alternative
to intervention by the United Na
tions in a crisis where there was
a bitter confrontation in the cold
war.
NO CAUTIOUS and timid man
would have dreamed of staking
the prestige and perhaps the fu
ture of the United Nations, as well
as his personal reputation and his
office, on the attempt to pacify
the Congo.
But great as were the risks of
intervention, the risks of letting
events run their course were
much greater. If the United Na
tions now fails in what Hammar
skjold inaugurated, the prospects
are that the terrible racial strug
gle between Europeans and Afri
cans will become deeply entangled
in the conflict between the West
ern powers and the Communist
powers of the Soviet Union and
China.
It was to avert and to prevent
this fatal entanglement that Ham
marskjold dared to use the powers
of the United Nations. The out
come is as yet unknown.
BUT WHAT we do know is that
his unprecedented innovation in
world affairs has run into fearful
resistance both in the East and in
the West. Hammarskj old’s use of
the U.N. to isolate and disinfect
the Congo crisis brought on him
and the U.N. the implacable ha
tred of the Soviet government.
At the same time Hammar
skjold did not have the full sup
port of the Western powers. In
Algeria, in Katanga, in Angola, in
Rhodesia, and in South Africa
there is bitter resistance to the ob
jectives of the United Nations in
the Congo.
Those objectives are to protect
the transition from white suprem
acy, which cannot be continued
much longer, to African self-gov
ernment, for which the Africans
are so unprepared.
THERE IS NO doubt that in
the administration of the now
U.N. policy there have been mis
takes. errors of judgment and
failures of personnel.
But let us keep it in mind that
the cause of the two-sided opposi
tion to the U.N. action is not the
mistakes, which are not irrepar
able. The cause of the opposition
from East and West is a deter
mination not to have the U.N. suc
ceed in what it is attempting to
do. For if the U.N. succeeds, there
will not be a Communist govern

merit in the Congo.
That is what Khrushchev hates
about Hammarskjold and the Sec
retary General’s office. And if the
U.N. succeeds, there will not be a
restoration of white supremacy
in the Congo, and that is why
money, propaganda, and clandes
tine intervention are being em
ployed to frustrate the U.N.
NO ONE KNOWS today who
can come after Hammarskjold,
and there are many signs that he
is in fact irreplaceable. For Ham
marskjold was made Secretary
General at a time when the U.N.
was really no more than a debat
ing society. Except for the police
action in Korea it passed resolu
tions which aimed at mediation
and conciliation, hut it did not in
any important place command ex
ecutive action.
It is easy to say that the world
is not ready for international ac
tion to establish peace, and it
would be hard to refute such a
statement.
Hammarskjold, under the fear
ful pressure of circumstances, re
sorted to international action.
With his extraordinary diplomatic
elegance and finesse, he used suc
cessfully international action at
Suez, in Palestine and in Laos. As
compared with these the Congo
presented a new order of diffi
culty, and the outcome, now that
Hammarskjold is dead, is in the
gravest doubt.
IF THE WORLD is not ready
for what Hammarskjold felt com
pelled to try in the Congo, it is
also true, I hate to say. that this
present world is not ready for the
kind of man Hammarskjold was.
He was a Western man in the
highest traditions of political ex
cellence in the West.
Khrushchev says that Hammar
skjold was not neutral in the Con
go, and that there is no such thing
as a neutral man. Hammarskjold
was in fact the embodiment of the
noblest Western political achieve
ment that laws can be adminis
tered by judges and civil servants
who have their first allegiance to
the laws, and not to their personal,
their class, or even their national
interests.

No such political ideal is be
lieved to he possible or is regarded
as tolerable in the Marxist world.
The ideal is not very well under
stood in most of the rest of the
world, and there is no use pretend
ing that such public servants are
not very rare indeed. So there are
times, as now in this hour of our
grief and shock, when the ideal
seems to belong to things that are
passing away.

Over the years I have often
