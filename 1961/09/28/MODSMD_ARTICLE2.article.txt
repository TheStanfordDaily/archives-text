"Water consumption this year
has been reduced by 45 million
gallons through the conscientious
efforts of our residents,” Post
said.

winter rains will replenish our
lakes and reservoirs and improve
the water table situation so that
rationing will not be necessary
next year.”
Stanford has been on strict
water rationing since April 14 in
its driest year on record. For the
