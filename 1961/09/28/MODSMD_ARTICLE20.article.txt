## Academic Freedom IS Practiced at Stanford 
### 
Columnist Ross Hermann
slated in yesterday’s Daily that
Stanford students are being sub
jected to professors of liberal be
liefs and that in all fairness con
servative professors should be
hired to counter this one-sided
ness.
To substanliate his argument,
Mr. Hermann claims that sociolo
gists “are generally bound to
gether by their contempt of re
ligion . . . and are fond of promot
ing such social leveling schemes
as a 100 per cent inheritance tax,”
and that political scientists “tend
to favor greater centralization of
government, promote the power
of the chief executive at the ex
pense of Congress, and look for
ward with a contented sigh to the
rise of world political organiza
tion, to the detriment of opposing
views.”
Prof. Sanford M. Dornbusch,
head of the sociology department,
does not agree with Mr. Her
mann’s comments.
HE SAID in an interview with
me that there are many sociolo
gists who do not condemn religion.
Dornbusch himself has written a
book called "Popular Religion”
which was neither theistic or athe
istic, but a scientific study of re
ligion.
Dornbusch also pointed out that
to his knowledge, no professor in
the Sociology Department advo
cates the 100 per cent inheritance
tax. Furthermore, Sociology Prof.
Tracy La Piere has written a
book, “The Freudian Ethic,”
which attacks liberalism, social
security, the coddling of crimi
nals and many other liberal shib
boleths.
Prof. Robert A. Walker, head of
the Political Science Department,
also disagrees with Mr. Hermann.
“I think this is nonsense,” Walker
stated in relation to Mr. Her
mann’s remarks. “All kinds of
view's are represented in our de
partment and some of our politi
cal science professors do not fa
vor what Mr. Hermann claims
they favor,”
WALKER ALSO pointed out
that students can ask faculty
members for opposing viewpoints
and will find faculty members
only too happy to reply.
In regard to the student, quite
obviously he is not forced to ac
cept anything a professor says,
whether it bo fact or value judg
ment. A student who disagrees
with a professor’s value judgment
is certainly free to say so and cer
tainly has access to the same ma
terials from which the professor
evolved his judgment.
Mr. Hermann apparently as
sumes that students are unable to
distinquish between a value judg
ment and a fact. This is ridiculous.
Any student who is unable to dif
ferentiate between the two does
not belong at a university, and
this is the very assumption under
which most professors operate.
If the student swallows a profes
sor’s viewpoint without first chew
ing it, then the student is at fault
and not the professor.
FINALLY, Mr. Hermann sug
gests that conservative professors
be hired to counter one-sidedness.
Even if we assume there is one
sidedness (and I have endeavored
to show there is not), a professor
is not hired because he is conserv
ative OR liberal.
The only just criterion by which
professors should bo judged and
ARE judged, is the professor’s
record as scholar and teacher. A
professor’s personal political, or
social, or economic views have
nothing to do with his employ
ment.

If a professor’s personal views
are stated, the professor tells the
students the views are his or the
views are so obviously his that he
has no need to say so.
THE IMPORTANT thing to
keep in mind, however, is that
professors are not hired on a basis
of their political beliefs. There
fore, if there are more “liberal”
professors here than “conserva
tive” professors, as Mr. Hermann
asserts, then the seemingly ob
vious conclusion is that the con
servatives have only themselves
to blame for not having more
scholars in their ranks.
In short, Ross Hermann’s as
sumptions are not substantiated
by fact. The facts are on the side
of those who think Stanford IS

should continue to do so.

be hired to counter one-sidedness.
Even if we assume there is one
sidedness (and I have endeavored
to show there is not), a professor
is not hired because he is conserv
ative OR liberal.
The only just criterion by which
professors should bo judged and
ARE judged, is the professor’s
record as scholar and teacher. A
professor’s personal political, or
social, or economic views have
nothing to do with his employ
ment.

If a professor’s personal views
are stated, the professor tells the
students the views are his or the
views are so obviously his that he
has no need to say so.
THE IMPORTANT thing to
keep in mind, however, is that
professors are not hired on a basis
of their political beliefs. There
fore, if there are more “liberal”
professors here than “conserva
tive” professors, as Mr. Hermann
asserts, then the seemingly ob
vious conclusion is that the con
servatives have only themselves
to blame for not having more
scholars in their ranks.
In short, Ross Hermann’s as
sumptions are not substantiated
by fact. The facts are on the side
of those who think Stanford IS
practicing academic freedom and
should continue to do so.
Columnist Ross Hermann
slated in yesterday’s Daily that
Stanford students are being sub
jected to professors of liberal be
liefs and that in all fairness con
servative professors should be
hired to counter this one-sided
ness.
To substanliate his argument,
Mr. Hermann claims that sociolo
gists “are generally bound to
gether by their contempt of re
ligion . . . and are fond of promot
ing such social leveling schemes
as a 100 per cent inheritance tax,”
and that political scientists “tend
to favor greater centralization of
government, promote the power
of the chief executive at the ex
pense of Congress, and look for
ward with a contented sigh to the
rise of world political organiza
tion, to the detriment of opposing
views.”
Prof. Sanford M. Dornbusch,
head of the sociology department,
does not agree with Mr. Her
mann’s comments.
HE SAID in an interview with
me that there are many sociolo
gists who do not condemn religion.
Dornbusch himself has written a
book called "Popular Religion”
which was neither theistic or athe
istic, but a scientific study of re
ligion.
Dornbusch also pointed out that
to his knowledge, no professor in
the Sociology Department advo
cates the 100 per cent inheritance
tax. Furthermore, Sociology Prof.
Tracy La Piere has written a
book, “The Freudian Ethic,”
which attacks liberalism, social
security, the coddling of crimi
nals and many other liberal shib
boleths.
Prof. Robert A. Walker, head of
the Political Science Department,
also disagrees with Mr. Hermann.
“I think this is nonsense,” Walker
stated in relation to Mr. Her
mann’s remarks. “All kinds of
view's are represented in our de
partment and some of our politi
cal science professors do not fa
vor what Mr. Hermann claims
they favor,”
WALKER ALSO pointed out
that students can ask faculty
members for opposing viewpoints
and will find faculty members
only too happy to reply.
In regard to the student, quite
obviously he is not forced to ac
cept anything a professor says,
whether it bo fact or value judg
ment. A student who disagrees
with a professor’s value judgment
is certainly free to say so and cer
tainly has access to the same ma
terials from which the professor
evolved his judgment.
Mr. Hermann apparently as
sumes that students are unable to
distinquish between a value judg
ment and a fact. This is ridiculous.
Any student who is unable to dif
ferentiate between the two does
not belong at a university, and
this is the very assumption under
which most professors operate.
If the student swallows a profes
sor’s viewpoint without first chew
ing it, then the student is at fault
and not the professor.

stated in relation to Mr. Her
mann’s remarks. “All kinds of
view's are represented in our de
partment and some of our politi
cal science professors do not fa
vor what Mr. Hermann claims
they favor,”
WALKER ALSO pointed out
that students can ask faculty
members for opposing viewpoints
and will find faculty members
only too happy to reply.
In regard to the student, quite
obviously he is not forced to ac
cept anything a professor says,
whether it bo fact or value judg
ment. A student who disagrees
with a professor’s value judgment
is certainly free to say so and cer
tainly has access to the same ma
terials from which the professor
evolved his judgment.
Mr. Hermann apparently as
sumes that students are unable to
distinquish between a value judg
ment and a fact. This is ridiculous.
Any student who is unable to dif
ferentiate between the two does
not belong at a university, and
this is the very assumption under
which most professors operate.
If the student swallows a profes
sor’s viewpoint without first chew
ing it, then the student is at fault
and not the professor.
FINALLY, Mr. Hermann sug
gests that conservative professors
be hired to counter one-sidedness.
Even if we assume there is one
sidedness (and I have endeavored
to show there is not), a professor
is not hired because he is conserv
ative OR liberal.
The only just criterion by which
professors should bo judged and
ARE judged, is the professor’s
record as scholar and teacher. A
professor’s personal political, or
social, or economic views have
nothing to do with his employ
ment.

If a professor’s personal views
are stated, the professor tells the
students the views are his or the
views are so obviously his that he
has no need to say so.
THE IMPORTANT thing to
keep in mind, however, is that
professors are not hired on a basis
of their political beliefs. There
fore, if there are more “liberal”
professors here than “conserva
tive” professors, as Mr. Hermann
asserts, then the seemingly ob
vious conclusion is that the con
servatives have only themselves
to blame for not having more
scholars in their ranks.
In short, Ross Hermann’s as
sumptions are not substantiated
by fact. The facts are on the side
of those who think Stanford IS
practicing academic freedom and
should continue to do so.
