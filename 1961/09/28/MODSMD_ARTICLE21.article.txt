Editor, The Daily:
Ross Hermann in his article.of
September 27 urging “conserva
tive indoctrinators” at Stanford,
stated that in the 1960 election
poll, freshmen voted 445 to 193
for Nixon, while “graduate stu
dents, after four years or more of
exposure to the Stanford educa
tional process, voted 178 to 138
for Kennedy.”
I would like to point out that
most graduate students now at
Stanford were graduated from
other schools. They come from all
over the country, and probably
less than 25 per cent were exposed
to the Stanford educational pro
cess as undergraduates.
Thus it is far more reasonable
to conclude that these statistics,
in so far as they mean anything
at all, indicate that the more edu
cation one receives in the United
States, the more likely he is to
favor Kennedy over Nixon.
