Editor, The Daily:
Yes, it is a shame that Kennedy
omitted Red China from his ad
dress he should have condemn
ed its admission and threatened
U.S. veto power if needed. The
United Nations is passive enough
now toward Communist hostili
ties it invades the sovereign
province of Katanga, yet merely
chooses to talk about Communist
invasions of Tibet or Hungary.
The U.N. acknowledged Red
China to be the aggressor in the
Korean crisis and took “police ac
tion” accordingly. As of yet, no
peace treaty exists in Korea
how then do the “peace-striving”
members of the U.N. suddenly
“feel” Red China to be a fit can
didate for admission? Any at
tempt to equate non-admission of
Red China to the U.N. with deny
ing the existence of the Peiping
regime is sophistry.
I think a constitution was once
written for the U.N. Two sections
of Article 2, Chapter I Purposes
and Principles are of interest
in considering what values the
U.N. holds . . . and what it prac
tices.
Sec. 4 “All members shall re
frain in their international rela
tions from the threat or use of
force against the territorial integ
rity or political independence of
any state, or in any other manner
inconsistent with the Purposes of
the United Nations.”
Sec. 6—“ The Organization shall
ensure that states which are not
Members of the United Nations
act in accordance with these Prin
ciples, so far as may be necessary
for the maintenance of interna
tional peace and security.”
The U.N. sets itself up with an
absolute aim “to maintain in
ternational peace and security."
When this aim is compromised,
future words and actions amount
to only hypocrisy. If the termites
finally destroy the temple of
the U.N., it will not be because
the U.N. adhered to, or acted with
its principles. And if the Com
munists win, it will be only
through our default.
Eric Valentine
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to address myself
to a paragraph appearing in Ro-ss
Plermann’s editorial of Sept. 27:
“Sociologists are generally
bound together by their contempt
of religion as a narcotic of the
mind and are fond of promoting
such social leveling schemes as a
100 per cent inheritance tax.”
Now, I have not made a study of
what “generally binds” sociolo
gists, so I can really only speak
for myself, one sociologist. But
Mr. Hermann grossly misper
ceives the profession as a whole.
Sociologists are generally agreed
(not wholly) upon the methods
and logic of scientific research,
and at times upon the empirical
generalizations derived from these
procedures. Rarely, or so it seems
to me, are they agreed upon the
political plans of action; in this
respect there are “liberal” as well
as “conservative” professional
sociologists.
Another distortion apparent in
Hermann’s article must be cor
rected. The sociological study of
religion is one guided by the pre
cept of objectivity, to finding out
what it “is,” and not what it is
“worth.” In speaking of religion I
would distinguish between the for
mal, social institutions embodying
“a” religion and religious life in
general. For the latter the criteri
on is the capacity for a rich spirit
ual and emotional expression, and
not “attendance” or “belonging
ness.” The decision is individual,
in Kierkegaardian terms, “either/
or.” Either a religious, life based
on a synthesis of one’s own ex
perience, or one based on the pre
formulated paths of society. I per
sonally feel that religions are nar
row in their conception of man
and nature, and I would disclaim
their pretentions to “absolute
validity.” But it is argued that a
religion must make such preten
tions and to this I can, from a
sociological stance, agree.
Finally, to what Hermann
terms “social leveling” I prefer
to attach the term “social uplift
ing.” This is only because I be
lieve in an old American tenet:
equality of opportunity. Inherited
wealth destroys equality of op
portunity. But to which group of
sociologists is Mr. Hermann re
ferring? I know of many who be
lieve that equality of opportunity
as realized through inheritance
taxes of 100 per cent is not feasi
ble, aside from the question of
whether or not it is desirable.
My conclusions: Mr. Hermann
does not really know what binds
sociologists together; indeed, I
wonder if he knows at all what
they are about. Further, his sup
port of the sanctity of inheritance
wealth is to my mind a direct re
pudiation of an all American
ideal.
Edwin S. Harwood
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to commend Ron Rapo
port for his perceptive view of
Frank J. Donner’s book. “The Un-
Americans,” an “objective” study
of the HUAC. In Mr, Rapoport’s
words, “There is probably no bet
ter study of the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee.”
Described by the publisher as
a “noted constitutional lawyer,”
Frank J. Donner is eminently
qualified to discuss the problem
of Communist subversion in the
United States. He has been identi
fied under oath upon three differ

ent occasions as a member of a
Communist cell which operated
within the National Labor Rela
tions Board during the Roosevelt
era.
In December, 19155, Donner was
identified as a party member by
Herbert Fuchs, who organized the
cell and participated in its work
for five years thereafter.
Later in the month. Mortimer
Reimer, a former Communist,
identified Donner a member of the
NLRB cell. In 1956, one time Com
munist Harry Cooper testified un
der oath that the honorable Frank
J. Donner was a Communist.
When Donner appeared before
the HUAC in 1956 and in 1959, he
invoked the Fifth Amendment on
33 different occasions when ques
tioned about his party activities.
He is presently retained as gen
eral counsel for the United Elec
trical Workers, a union expelled
from the CIO in 1950 for being
Communist dominated.
Thus, the “objective constitu
tional lawyer” is not unacquainted
with the work of the HUAC. Mr.
Donner’s background indeed, per
mits Mrs. Rapoport to safely state
that his “approach” is direct, his
research complete, his conclusions
logical, and his viewpoint fascin
ating.”
To paraphrase Lee Edwards,
“we now await an objective treat
ment of the Nazi party written by
George Lincoln Rockwell, ‘a for
mer Navy commander.’ ”
