# Quarterback Spot Tossup as Cards Journey to Meet OSC
## 
### KEN DERY 
I) looks like a tossup between
seniors Chuck Butler and Rod
Sears for the starting quarterback
job on Saturday, but all the other
positions remain the same as
Coach Jack Curtice’s Cards jour
ney to Corvallis and a clash with
tough Oregon State.
The Indians are riding high
after outplaying a sluggish Tualne
squad, but will have to come up
with an even greater effort if they
are to best the talented Beavers.
The odds makers have picked
OSC to win by 12'i> points.

Although it was a startling 47-
yard aerial from Butler to senior
Larry Royso which enabled Stan
ford to come from behind and nip
the Green Wave, the quarterback
slot is still a roulette game for
Cactus Jack. In addition to Butler
and the comparative veteran
Sears, there is also highly regard
ed sophomore Steve Thurlow.
What makes things so difficult
for Coach Curtice is that Sears
and Butler are both seniors and
Thurlow is but a soph.
Butler has had very little game
experience. In fact he appeared
in only one contest for eleven min
ute's in 1957. then went into the
Marines for two years, and saw
but a minute and a half of action
in two games during the 1960 sea
son.
SEARS is a more proven quan
tity. He was Dick Norman’s un
derstudy for two years and on oc
casion got the call when Norman
was having an off day. Usually
Rod did a commendable job.
Thurlow is generally thought of
as a boy of fine promise. He has
good size (6-2’i, 199) a fine arm,
and excellent poise for a young
ster at this stage. He is a skillful
ball handler and can throw the
long one, but because of his youth
the starter will probably be either
Sears or Butler.
The other ten positions will be

about the same which faced Tu
lane, provided that Frank Atkin
son and Gary Sargent recover
from a touch of the flu.
STEVE Pursell and George
Honore will handle the ends; At
kinson and C. B. Simons will take
the tackle slots; Errol Scott and
Tom Walsh will manage the guard
duty and Chris Cottle will open
at center.
The remainder of the backfield
should find Gary Craig, Royse and
Sargent running from the half
back spots and Hal Steuber at full
back.
Atkinson and Simons are de
veloping into top tackles. They
both are big and strong Frank

is 6-2'2, 217 while C. B. is 6-1 and
228. Atkinson was voted lineman
of the week by West Coast sports
scribes this week and looks like
a real find. He is just a sopho
more in eligibility.
SIMONS was very popular with
the fans last year, for he is ag
gressive and can be a tiger rush
ing the opposing passer.
Junior Steve Purcell played one
of his tough steady games in last
Saturday’s home opener and
should bo recognized as one of
the area’s outstanding ends before
the season gets too much older.
He shined as a sophomore last
season and should continue to
improve on a more balanced club.
Steve is the brother of Doug
Pursell, who was headed for all
coast honors last season until a
knee injury put him on the shelf.

C. B. SIMONS - PASSERS’ NEMESIS
Junior Tackle C. B. Simons will lead the young Stanford line against
Oregon State Saturday as the Indians shoot for their second straight
win. The Beavers are heavily favored.
I) looks like a tossup between
seniors Chuck Butler and Rod
Sears for the starting quarterback
job on Saturday, but all the other
positions remain the same as
Coach Jack Curtice’s Cards jour
ney to Corvallis and a clash with
tough Oregon State.
The Indians are riding high
after outplaying a sluggish Tualne
squad, but will have to come up
with an even greater effort if they
are to best the talented Beavers.
The odds makers have picked
OSC to win by 12'i> points.

Although it was a startling 47-
yard aerial from Butler to senior
Larry Royso which enabled Stan
ford to come from behind and nip
the Green Wave, the quarterback
slot is still a roulette game for
Cactus Jack. In addition to Butler
and the comparative veteran
Sears, there is also highly regard
ed sophomore Steve Thurlow.
What makes things so difficult
for Coach Curtice is that Sears
and Butler are both seniors and
Thurlow is but a soph.
Butler has had very little game
experience. In fact he appeared
in only one contest for eleven min
ute's in 1957. then went into the
Marines for two years, and saw
but a minute and a half of action
in two games during the 1960 sea
son.
SEARS is a more proven quan
tity. He was Dick Norman’s un
derstudy for two years and on oc
casion got the call when Norman
was having an off day. Usually
Rod did a commendable job.
Thurlow is generally thought of
as a boy of fine promise. He has
good size (6-2’i, 199) a fine arm,
and excellent poise for a young
ster at this stage. He is a skillful
ball handler and can throw the
long one, but because of his youth
the starter will probably be either
Sears or Butler.
The other ten positions will be

about the same which faced Tu
lane, provided that Frank Atkin
son and Gary Sargent recover
from a touch of the flu.
STEVE Pursell and George
Honore will handle the ends; At
kinson and C. B. Simons will take
the tackle slots; Errol Scott and
Tom Walsh will manage the guard
duty and Chris Cottle will open
at center.
The remainder of the backfield
should find Gary Craig, Royse and
Sargent running from the half
back spots and Hal Steuber at full
back.
Atkinson and Simons are de
veloping into top tackles. They
both are big and strong Frank

is 6-2'2, 217 while C. B. is 6-1 and
228. Atkinson was voted lineman
of the week by West Coast sports
scribes this week and looks like
a real find. He is just a sopho
more in eligibility.
SIMONS was very popular with
the fans last year, for he is ag
gressive and can be a tiger rush
ing the opposing passer.
Junior Steve Purcell played one
of his tough steady games in last
Saturday’s home opener and
should bo recognized as one of
the area’s outstanding ends before
the season gets too much older.
He shined as a sophomore last
season and should continue to
improve on a more balanced club.
