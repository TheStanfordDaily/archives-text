# Frosh Nine Loses Talent to
## 
### TOM PARKER 
Editor's onto; This is the third
in :« series of articles introducing
the top freshman prospects in
each sport.

If cleats were spikes we'd have
the most terrific frosh team ever,
seems to be the sentiment of Ray
Young, freshman baseball coach.
“Most of the players we know any
thing about are out for frosh
football,” he laments.
Bucky Rosen, a versatile infield
er from Bcllarrnine High School
in San Jose, is among the top pros
pects for the frosh nine. He was
an all-league selection last season
and turned down professional
contracts to play the infield for
the Indians. Right now though,
he's on the lino of scrimmage.
I)I( K Ragsdale, a shortstop
from Medford, Oregon, played
three varsity sports, but he too is
•working out with Coach Dan
Stavely’s frosh eleven.
Other top prospects now on the
gridiron include Buzz Riegel of
Tacoma, the only catcher to re
port; Morrison Warren, an out
fielder from Phoenix; and Boh
Taylor a right-handed pitcher hail
ing from El Paso.
But Coach Young definitely has
not given up hope. He still has
come fine material in infielders
George Thatcher who hit over .400
for a Los Altos High School cham
pionship team and an American
Legion club; and Craig Crock
will, a speedy little shortstop from
Portland with semi-pro experi
ence.
OTHER leading candidates in
clude Jim Conti, Beverly Hills;
George Ashman, Palos Verdes;
Dave Stout, Burlingame; Rich

Berra, Bakersfield; Larry Garner,
Chicago, 111.; Bob Maslow, Brook
lyn, N.Y.; Bob Hartwig, Sheridan,
Wyoming; Jack Seed, Minnesota;
Larry Anderson, Torrance; and
Mike Joseph, Glendale.
More potential starters are Bob
Garnero, who hit .300 in both high
school and American Legion
leagues; Bret Brenneman, Hono
lulu. Hawaii; Cliff Devery. Santa
Maria; Dave Dinges, Shawnee
Mission, Kansas; Dave Hedges,
Houston, Texas; and Bill Hallau
er, Colorado Springs, Colo.
The pitching staff, with a con
spicuous absence of left-handers,
has depth but lacks experience.
Dave Dickson of South Pasadena
was a two-year all league pick and
all-CIF in his senior year. Ho is a
control pitcher with a knuckle
bail that is notorious in the South
land.
Dick Siler of Palos Verdes, Joe
Osterhof, San Francisco; John
Michelet, Portland, Ore.; Bill Mad
lener, Chicago, 111.; and Rich Sim
mons, Cresterton, Calif, provide
the depth Young will need in (he
coming season.
MAJOR LEAGUE SCORES
(UPI) Rookie Danny Murphy
hit two home runs and rookie Ken
Hubbs belted a homer and a triple
yesterday to lead the Chicago
Cubs to a 5-2 win over the St.
Louis Cardinals.
In the only other daylight ac
tion, Jim Gentile poled his 46th
homer and Steve Barber scored
his 18th win as the Baltimore Ori
oles edged the New York Yankees,
3-2, while sluggers Roger Maris
and Mickey Mantle took the day
off.

If cleats were spikes we'd have
the most terrific frosh team ever,
seems to be the sentiment of Ray
Young, freshman baseball coach.
“Most of the players we know any
thing about are out for frosh
football,” he laments.
Bucky Rosen, a versatile infield
er from Bcllarrnine High School
in San Jose, is among the top pros
pects for the frosh nine. He was
an all-league selection last season
and turned down professional
contracts to play the infield for
the Indians. Right now though,
he's on the lino of scrimmage.
I)I( K Ragsdale, a shortstop
from Medford, Oregon, played
three varsity sports, but he too is
•working out with Coach Dan
Stavely’s frosh eleven.
Other top prospects now on the
gridiron include Buzz Riegel of
Tacoma, the only catcher to re
port; Morrison Warren, an out
fielder from Phoenix; and Boh
Taylor a right-handed pitcher hail
ing from El Paso.
But Coach Young definitely has
not given up hope. He still has
come fine material in infielders
George Thatcher who hit over .400
for a Los Altos High School cham
pionship team and an American
Legion club; and Craig Crock
will, a speedy little shortstop from
Portland with semi-pro experi
