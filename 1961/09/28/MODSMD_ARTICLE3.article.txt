# Congressional Leaders See Trouble for JFK
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) —Lead
ers of the Bith Congress Ngreed
yesterday that President Ken
nedy’s program faces far tougher
going in election-year 1962 than in
the “honeymoon” session of his
new administration.
Congress adjourned for the
year with the Senate raging at
House tactics on the final bill
and with Republicans and Demo
crats arguing over the “accom
plishments” or “failures” of the
first session.
BUT MEMBERS of both parties
agreed that those squabbles would
be minor compared to the fire
works certain to explode next
year. Among other things, Ken
nedy will be pushing for approval
of medical care for the elderly
under Social Security, higher post
al rates and tax revision. All are
so controversial that congression
al leaders postponed showdowns
this year.
Kennedy could look back on a
first year session which his legis
lative lieutenants called produc
tive and which Republicans term-

Ed expensive and short on quality.
In the closing hours he was
given a $3,914,600,000 foreign aid
bill which was called satisfactory.
HE GOT JUST about all he
asked for defense and in the for
eign policy field, including cre
ation of the Peace Corps and a
new arms control agency.
In the domestic field, Congress
approved legislation on housing,
Social Security, highways, de
pressed areas, increased minimum
wage, unemployment compensa
tion extension, water pollution
control, community health facili
ties and tax extension.
In major defeats, he lost his
school aid program and had to
settle for a relatively minor farm
bill.
