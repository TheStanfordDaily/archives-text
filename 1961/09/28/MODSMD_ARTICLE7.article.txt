# Nixon to Run in California; ’64 Presidential Race Out
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (UPI) Richard M. Nixon announced last
night he would run for governor of California in 1962, and said
flatly he would not make a second bid for the presidency in 1964.
In a forthright, double-barreled statement in which he sought
to dispell any conjecture about his using the governorship as a

stepping stone to the presidency,
Nixon said at a press conference
he intended to serve a full four
years as governor if elected.
“I shall not be a candidate for
president of the United States in
1964,” said Nixon. “I will run for
governor of California in 1962.”
He said later in a televised ques
tion-and-answer session with re
porters that his statement “means
just what it says. And I hope the
people of the United States be
lieve me.”
BUT GOV. Edmund G. Brown,
the Democrat Nixon probably will
face in 1962, and former Gov.
Goodwin J. Knight obviously did
not believe him.
“He sees the governorship only
as a stepping stone for his own
political ambitions,” said Brown,
who was described last night by
Nixon as an “amiable but bun
gling man . . .”
Knight said he had every inten
tion of staying in the Republican
primary against Nixon.
“He says he will not be a can
didate for president. But he did
not say he will not be drafted,”
Knight said.
KNIGHT SAID he would fight
Nixon “down to the last vote on
the last day” in the bid for the
Republican gubernatorial nomi
nation.
Other Republican leaders were
not surprised. Sen. Barry Gold
water in Washington, a possible
1964 presidential candidate, said
he has long contended Nixon
would “have to run in California
and win if he was to retain a
voice in the Republican Party.”
President Kennedy, the man
Nixon lost to in November, had
no immediate comment.
ALF M. Landon, the 1936 Re
publican candidate for president,
said Nixon’s decision “as of now
gives New York Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller a clear field” in 1964.
Nixon, battling a cold, in a
rapid-fire, well-covered press ses
sion, said he did not regard it as
a “sacrifice” to serve in public
life. “I want to be in public serv
ice,” he said, adding financial re
turns in private life were “be
yond my dreams.”
“The most exciting, challenging
position I can see next to being
president of the United States,”
said Nixon, “is to be governor of
this state.”
NIXON set his own standards
for the governor of California,
describing his ideal as one who
“is strong enough in his own
right to be independent of any
pressure group . . .”
He also said the gubernatorial
candidate must attract top men
to state government posts and
“most important of all, the next
governor of this state must be
a man who will devote not part
but all of his energies to this
job.”
