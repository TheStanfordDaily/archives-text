# 'Better for All' -Says Sterling Of SU Future
## 
### RICHARD INWOOD 
“This . . . can be a better place
for all of us.”
So ran the theme of President
Wallace Sterling’s address, given
before a group of freshman men
gathered last night in Cedro
lounge.
When asked by a worried fresh
man what would happen when
the PACE inertial finally slowed,
Sterling replied, “More PACE, I
expect.”
He pointed out that PACE, as
a Stanford policy, is new only
in degree and that Stanford had
earned the Ford Foundation
assistance by its work in the pre
vious decade. Sterling opined
that Stanford’s present impi’ove
ment drive may show sufficient
returns to earn continued sup
port.
HE EXPLAINED that pressing
financial need has been, and con
tinues to be, “so compelling it is
the first and only consideration.”
In response to questions from
the floor, Sterling indicated that,
although Stanford will move
toward an increased percentage
of small classes, or tutorials,
“there is a very important place
for the lecture system.” “I would
much rather,” he said, “have a
first-rate teacher of 100 students
than place a second-rate instruc
tor before 10.”
This prompted a query; How
does Stanford, supposedly short
of funds, continually manage to
attract top Eastern professors to
its campus?
STERLING explained that a
top faculty is top priority. He
confessed that high salaries and
“that prostitution of the soul
which Americans call salesman
ship" (a long-remembered quote)
were contributing factors, but
felt that the part played by “good
students and good programs”
(“Throw in climate and coeds")
was undervalued.
“In Stanford’s range of pro
grams,” said the president, ‘ we
can give anybody a run for his
money and help him over the fin
ish line.”
Sterling attributed Stanford’s
gains in the past 15 years in
great part to burgeoning national
population and economy, especi
ally in the West, and to the ex
perimental freedom inherent in
a private university.
“This . . . can be a better place
for all of us.”

In response to questions from
the floor, Sterling indicated that,
although Stanford will move
toward an increased percentage
of small classes, or tutorials,
“there is a very important place
for the lecture system.” “I would
much rather,” he said, “have a
first-rate teacher of 100 students
than place a second-rate instruc
tor before 10.”
This prompted a query; How
does Stanford, supposedly short
of funds, continually manage to
attract top Eastern professors to
its campus?
STERLING explained that a
top faculty is top priority. He
confessed that high salaries and
“that prostitution of the soul
which Americans call salesman
ship" (a long-remembered quote)
were contributing factors, but
felt that the part played by “good
students and good programs”
(“Throw in climate and coeds")
was undervalued.
“In Stanford’s range of pro
grams,” said the president, ‘ we
can give anybody a run for his
money and help him over the fin
ish line.”
Sterling attributed Stanford’s
gains in the past 15 years in
great part to burgeoning national
population and economy, especi
ally in the West, and to the ex
perimental freedom inherent in
a private university.
