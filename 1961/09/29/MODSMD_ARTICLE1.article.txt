# Rhinelander Out Of Dean's Chair; Sears Takes Over
## 
### 
Dr. Robert R. Sears, head of
Stanford’s Psychology Depart
ment, has been appointed dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences. He replaces Dr. Philip
H. Rhinelander who resigned this
summer.

Rhinelander is staying on, how
ever, as a professor of philosophy.
Sears is a distinguished child
psychologist and an authority on
teacher-child relationships. He will
head the University’s largest aca
demic unit, composed of 25 de
partments and more than 300 pro
fessorial faculty members.
HE IS currently on leave for
study and research in Europe. He
will return for the start of winter
quarter. Associate Dean Patrick
C. Suppes will serve as acting
dean until Sears returns. Associ
ate Dean Sanford W. Dornbusch
also will remain on the job.
Rhinelander, whose surprising
resignation came in July, said “I
think Dr. Sears will do a good
job.”

Administration sources told The
Daily at the time of the resigna
tion that Rhinelander’s decision
stemmed partly from differences
between him and University Pro
vost Frederick Terman over the
amount of Money being allocated
to humanities and the amount
given to science.
THU 53-YEAR-OLD Rhineland
er came to Stanford in 1956 after
a three-year nationwide search
for a man to fill the job. He came
West from Harvard, where he was
director of general education and
where ho received his A.8., L.L.D.
and Ph.D.
He often has stated a belief that
an administrator should keep his

hand in teaching. “In my view the
only good administrator is a re
luctant administrator,” he once
said.
He had “no statement” to make
on the reasons for his resignation.
Sears’ ties to Stanford go back
to his birth in Palo Alto, the son
of Jesse Brundage Sears, Stanford
professor of education.
AFTER attending Palo Alto
schools Sears earned a bachelor’s
degree in psychology at Stanford
in 1929 and a Ph.D. from Yale in
1932.
He taught at Illinois and Yale be
fore he became research profes
sor of child psychology and direc
tor of the lowa Child Welfare Re
search Station at the University
of lowa in 1942.
He joined the Harvard faculty
in 1949 as professor of education
and child psychology and director
of the Laboratory of Human De
velopment. He returned to Stan
ford in 1953.
