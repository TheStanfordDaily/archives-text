# New Dean's Goal: Create Smart, Lovable Women
## 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
“Can an educated woman be a person of charm
and integrity, a scholar, a helpful wife and mother,
and a lovable woman?’’ was a question posed by
Dean of Women Lucile Allen last night to a general
assembly of women students.
The meeting, sponsored by AWS, was arranged
to welcome the new dean and her assistant dean,
Bonnie Fitzwater. AWS President Linda Gogins
opened the meeting, followed by Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler who introduced the dean.
Stressing the Importance of developing charm
ing, versatile, and educated women, Dean Allen
stated that “Undergraduate and graduate women
should give serious thought to burying the stereo
type of educated women,” the stereotype which
portrays the educated woman as “cantankerous,
unreasonable and an expert only in knowledge.”
SHE POINTED out “Mid 20th century women
do not have the imago to follow that 20th century
men have.” Men have the image of their fathers
who are versatile people good hosts, sportsmen,
fathers, husbands as well as competent executives.
“You are facing more pressure concerning the
kind of person to be than women who have ever

bofore entered instutions of higher learning,” Dean
Allen continued. Though lacking the time to dis
cuss in detail the origins of these pressures, the
Dean expressed hopes to discuss these problems
with small groups of women in the future.
COMMENTING on rules and regulations, Dean
Allen expressed the hope ‘‘not to spend too much
time talking about rules. 1 assume that Stanford
women have the ability to run their own houses.”
On the advantages of rules, she stated “we must
remember that women are not little men, they are
different,” saying that some regulation proves
profitable.
She also pointed out that undergraduate women
at Stanford have more room for free decision than
most graduate women at other universities.
Concluding her talk, Dean Allen quoted the re
plies of some of the Stanford men whom she had
asked what she should include in her talk. One
fellow asked her to ask “Could neatness be a real
asset of all Stanford women?” Another asked
“How can anyone in the 20th century possess an air
of mystery?” Dean Allen closed by quoting from a
“wise bard who said, ‘Everything that is, is with
more pleasure chased than enjoyed.”
She commented “This may he a little cynical,
bid I think it says something to all of us.”'

bid I think it says something to all of us.”'
“Can an educated woman be a person of charm
and integrity, a scholar, a helpful wife and mother,
and a lovable woman?’’ was a question posed by
Dean of Women Lucile Allen last night to a general
assembly of women students.
The meeting, sponsored by AWS, was arranged
to welcome the new dean and her assistant dean,
Bonnie Fitzwater. AWS President Linda Gogins
opened the meeting, followed by Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler who introduced the dean.
Stressing the Importance of developing charm
ing, versatile, and educated women, Dean Allen
stated that “Undergraduate and graduate women
should give serious thought to burying the stereo
type of educated women,” the stereotype which
portrays the educated woman as “cantankerous,
unreasonable and an expert only in knowledge.”
SHE POINTED out “Mid 20th century women
do not have the imago to follow that 20th century
men have.” Men have the image of their fathers
who are versatile people good hosts, sportsmen,
fathers, husbands as well as competent executives.
“You are facing more pressure concerning the
kind of person to be than women who have ever

bofore entered instutions of higher learning,” Dean
Allen continued. Though lacking the time to dis
cuss in detail the origins of these pressures, the
Dean expressed hopes to discuss these problems
with small groups of women in the future.
COMMENTING on rules and regulations, Dean
Allen expressed the hope ‘‘not to spend too much
time talking about rules. 1 assume that Stanford
women have the ability to run their own houses.”
On the advantages of rules, she stated “we must
remember that women are not little men, they are
different,” saying that some regulation proves
profitable.
She also pointed out that undergraduate women
at Stanford have more room for free decision than
most graduate women at other universities.
Concluding her talk, Dean Allen quoted the re
plies of some of the Stanford men whom she had
asked what she should include in her talk. One
fellow asked her to ask “Could neatness be a real
asset of all Stanford women?” Another asked
“How can anyone in the 20th century possess an air
of mystery?” Dean Allen closed by quoting from a
“wise bard who said, ‘Everything that is, is with
more pleasure chased than enjoyed.”
She commented “This may he a little cynical,
bid I think it says something to all of us.”'
