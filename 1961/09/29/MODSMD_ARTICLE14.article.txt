# Civil Defense Waste Of Time, Money
## 
### 
“No one is a dead duck!” the now head of the nation’s civil de
fense agency cries in an article in today’s Daily.
Mr. Stuart Pittman, who must go down as one of the greatest
living optimists, firmly believes that the key to an “effective” civil
defense program does not rest with the $250 million appropriated
by Congress this session for his agency. Rather, he says, “The most
difficult job ... is to determine how we can make this a nationwide
program, and how we can give direction, guidance and leadership
to local efforts without imposing federal control.”
lie seems to forget—or maybe he isn’t aware of—statements by
hardened, dedicated CD’ers that it would take a huge allotment of
money to establish an effective CD program; effective meaning that
large numbers of people could survive underground for a couple of
weeks without serious injury. Since he doesn’t want to impose fed
eral control, it follows that he must get local agencies to cooperate
in planning for a nuclear attack, a task which shouldn’t be too diffi
cult if events of recent weeks are any indication.
As a start, we suggest he talk to CD officials in Las Vegas or
Bakersfield in Southern California, for they have worked out a very
logical, economical program—one main point of which is to gun
down any refugees from the Los Angeles area in the case of Las
Vegas—or shunt them into the desert as Bakersfield’s city fathers
plan to do. That’s true cooperation.
Mr. Pittman also feels that “no one knows” whether he will be
in a target area in a nuclear attack since there are “all sorts of
attack patterns, and no one knows which of them the enemy would
select.’ This statement must be comforting to the millions of per
sons in and around New York, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Washing
ton, Boston, San Francisco, Denver and Omaha, whose citizens can
now breathe easier in the knowledge that they just might not be in
a target area.
Unfortunately, Mr. Pittman did not mention to his interviewer
what would happen to these United States after the red button is
pressed, the bombs fall, the citizens (those able) burrow into their
varied shelters and then emerge. No one seems to want to think
about that.
The interviewer also reports that Mr. Pittman “decries the theory
that ‘life isn’t going to be worth living after an attack.’ He thinks
man could, and would, bounce back somehow.”
He surely would, Mr. Pittman. Drawing on his experience with
nuclear war and his vast knowledge of what it can do to men and
their planet, man would brush off the radioactive fallout, saunter
through the radioactive land and gather with his calm, collected
fellow men and decide (after democratically electing a chairman)
how to rebuild the United States.
Somehow, we would rather see the time, money and words being
wasted on civil defense put to better, more peacefid uses. There
are things wrong with this country and this world, and peace is in
danger. The little old ladies, retired colonels and well-meaning
citizens who champion civil defense could easily find more con
structive ways to ensure humanity’s survival.
