## Nixon Out of 1964 Race Only If He Is Beaten in California 
### WILLIAM THEIS 
WASHINGTON (UPH— For
mer Vice President Richard M.
Nixon is “out” of the 1964 Re
publican presidential picture only
if he fails to win the California
governorship.
This is about the safest conclu
sion that Nixon’s intimates would
make in weighing his announce
ment that he will run for the-gov
ernorship but “not seek the presi
dency in 1964.”
Traditionally, smart politicians
neither cross nor burn their
bridges until they have to do so.
NIXON, who lost to President
Kennedy last year by an histori
cally narrow margin, had to make
it clear he intends to serve a full
term if he is elected governor.
Any other stand would invite de
feat.
Also, few Republicans expect
1964 to be as good a time to try
for the White House as 1968
and Nixon at 48 is young enough
to wait.
But anything can happen to
alter drastically the conditions or
demands of the times.
“Dick can always take another
look at things in 1964,” one close
friend said recently in accurately
predicting that Nixon would try
to unseat Democratic Gov. Ed
mund (Pat) Brown.
A NIXON victory with or
without a slump in Kennedy’s
standing—would almost certainly
develop a “draft Nixon” move
ment for 1964,
But a Nixon defeat would spike
his presidential chances—perhaps
permanently.

The reaction of two Republi
cans who have much at stake in
Nixon’s decision pointed up some
of the political realities.
New York Gov. Nelson A. Rock
efeller sided with those who do
not feel that Nixon is “out of the
race” for ’64. Rockefeller, who is
almost certain to seek the presi
dential nomination, stressed that
it is * “premature” to count out
Nixon.
ON THE OTHER hand, Sen.
Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., a pos
sible conservative wing presiden
tial candidate, said he did not
think Nixon would use the gov
ernorship as a “stepping stone”
to the White House. Goldwater
said he believes Nixon’s no-can
didate statement is a “valid, hon
est promise and that Nixon will
wait until 1968.”
But political observers point
out that Goldwater, who also
wears the hat of Senate GOP
campaign chairman, could not
have said much else. His job is
to help reelect a California Re
publican to the Senate next year.
If he shared Rockefeller’s belief
that Nixon may still be available
in 1964, he could only damage his
party’s chances next year by ex
pressing it.
Nixon’s decision to run in Cali
fornia, hazardous as it may be,
came as no surprise. His associ
ates emphasize that a victory
would keep him in the political
limelight, broaden his adminis
trative experience, and give him
a badly needed personal staff for
the immediate years ahead.
