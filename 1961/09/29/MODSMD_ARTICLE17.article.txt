Editor, The Daily:
William F. Buckley Jr., found
er and editor-in-chief of the ex
treme rightist National Review,
seems to have found a reader and
follower in Ross Hermann. Mr.
Hermann’s article in Wednesday’s
Daily, in which he decries the lack
of right-wing “indoctrinators” at
Stanford, is typical of the specious
reasoning and stentorian pro
nouncements of the conservative
journalist.
The point of Hermann’s article,
and the point put forward in a
chapter of Buckley’s book, “Up
From Liberalism,’’ is not that
"education is largely a matter of
indoctrination any way you look
at it;” (Buckley) but that the way
Hermann and Buckley look at
current political, economic, and
sociological problems is not the
way that a large number of edu
cators do. This is evident when
Hermann says: “the disturbing
fact, though, is not so much that
indoctrination goes on but that
the bulk of it tends in one distinct
direction.”
The reason that the bulk of the
“indoctrination” tends in a liberal
direction is because the general
trend of thought in this country
today is in that direction also. It
is as absurd to suggest that Stan
ford hire educators to preach the
gospel of the repeal of the gradu
ated income tax and U.S. with
drawal from the United Nations;
both measures advocated by Buck
ley, as it is to suggest that the
Communist countries be allowed
to send teachers to present their
views to American college stu
dents with an eye towards “intel
lectual independence, academic
freedom and objectivity.”
Gary A. Patton
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Ronald A. Schneider at
tacked Ross Hermann’s column
of Sept. 27 by stating that the Po
litical Union figures used by Mr.
Hermann to show liberal indoc
trination, "in so far as they mean

anything, indicate that the more
education one receives in the
United States, the more likely he
is to favor Kennedy over Nixon.”
The implication here is that the
liberal ideology is the only one
that truly thoughtful and intelli
gent men can hold.
Mr. Hermann anticipated just
such an argument when ho so elo
quently said, “The liberal would
probably interpret the foregoing
figures by equating his ideology
with intellectualism, saying per
haps that the philosophical
changes were the direct result of
successful intellectual endeavor,
the assumption here being that
opposing philosophies are negated
by thoughtful scholarship.
“Such a contention,” Mr. Her
mann continued, “is ridiculous.
It is sheer bias to believe that any
one philosophy holds a monopoly
on intellectualism; almost all can
gain support from scholarship.”
The equation of left-wing phi
llosophy with intelligence is a
subtle attempt at book-burning.
As Henry J. Taylor said in a re
cent column in the Los Angeles
Times, “An intellectual is any man
or woman of high scholarship and

intellect. To bend the definition
to fit a political slant and then
imply that America is fortunate
today because intellectuals are at
work in the New Frontier is self
serving nonsense and a con game,
pure and simple.
“Interestingly enough, the man
who has more honorary degrees
(81) from more universities here
and abroad than any man in
America or in the entire world
is hardly a left-winger. That
man is former President Hoover.”

way that a large number of edu
cators do. This is evident when
Hermann says: “the disturbing
fact, though, is not so much that
indoctrination goes on but that
the bulk of it tends in one distinct
direction.”
The reason that the bulk of the
“indoctrination” tends in a liberal
direction is because the general
trend of thought in this country
today is in that direction also. It
is as absurd to suggest that Stan
ford hire educators to preach the
gospel of the repeal of the gradu
ated income tax and U.S. with
drawal from the United Nations;
both measures advocated by Buck
ley, as it is to suggest that the
Communist countries be allowed
to send teachers to present their
views to American college stu
dents with an eye towards “intel
lectual independence, academic
freedom and objectivity.”
Gary A. Patton
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Ronald A. Schneider at
tacked Ross Hermann’s column
of Sept. 27 by stating that the Po
litical Union figures used by Mr.
Hermann to show liberal indoc
trination, "in so far as they mean

anything, indicate that the more
education one receives in the
United States, the more likely he
is to favor Kennedy over Nixon.”
The implication here is that the
liberal ideology is the only one
that truly thoughtful and intelli
gent men can hold.
Mr. Hermann anticipated just
such an argument when ho so elo
quently said, “The liberal would
probably interpret the foregoing
figures by equating his ideology
with intellectualism, saying per
haps that the philosophical
changes were the direct result of
successful intellectual endeavor,
the assumption here being that
opposing philosophies are negated
by thoughtful scholarship.
“Such a contention,” Mr. Her
mann continued, “is ridiculous.
It is sheer bias to believe that any
one philosophy holds a monopoly
on intellectualism; almost all can
gain support from scholarship.”
The equation of left-wing phi
llosophy with intelligence is a
subtle attempt at book-burning.
As Henry J. Taylor said in a re
cent column in the Los Angeles
Times, “An intellectual is any man
or woman of high scholarship and

intellect. To bend the definition
to fit a political slant and then
imply that America is fortunate
today because intellectuals are at
work in the New Frontier is self
serving nonsense and a con game,
pure and simple.
“Interestingly enough, the man
who has more honorary degrees
(81) from more universities here
and abroad than any man in
America or in the entire world
is hardly a left-winger. That
man is former President Hoover.”

Editor, The Daily:
William F. Buckley Jr., found
er and editor-in-chief of the ex
treme rightist National Review,
seems to have found a reader and
follower in Ross Hermann. Mr.
Hermann’s article in Wednesday’s
Daily, in which he decries the lack
of right-wing “indoctrinators” at
Stanford, is typical of the specious
reasoning and stentorian pro
nouncements of the conservative
journalist.
The point of Hermann’s article,
and the point put forward in a
chapter of Buckley’s book, “Up
From Liberalism,’’ is not that
"education is largely a matter of
indoctrination any way you look
at it;” (Buckley) but that the way
Hermann and Buckley look at
current political, economic, and
sociological problems is not the
way that a large number of edu
cators do. This is evident when
Hermann says: “the disturbing
