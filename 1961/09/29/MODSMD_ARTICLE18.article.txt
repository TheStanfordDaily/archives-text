EDITOR. The Daily:
Mr. Barry Greenberg has shown
himself once again to be one of
the most gifted writers on The
Daily staff. Who else but a highly 1
intelligent, competent columnist
could write on one day (Sept. 26),
“Most important, faculty mem
bers protect students from a very
disturbing and important truth:
students are not as intelligent as
they think they are,” and then two
days later (Sept. 28) say, “Mr. I
Hermann apparently assumes that
students are unable to distinguish 1
between a value judgment and a !
fact. This is ridiculous. Any stu
dent who is unable to differentiate
the two does not belong at a uni- 1
versity.”
So Mr, Greenberg is seen on one
occasion ridiculing the intelligence |
of students and on another ncca. I

sion two days later upholding that
same intelligence.
Isn’t it wonderful how conflict
ing views can be used an different
occasions to fit one’s momentary
purpose?
