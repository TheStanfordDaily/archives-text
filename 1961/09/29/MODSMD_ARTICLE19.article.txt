# 2 Views on Civil Defense
## He Favors It And He Doesn't 
### DARRELL GARWOOD 
WASHINGTON (UPI) “No
one is a dead duck!
“The man who thinks his area
is the most vulnerable may very
well be one of those who will sur
vive and help put this country
back together again.”
Speaking was Steuart L. Pitt
man, 42, until recently a relatively
unknown Washington attorney
specializing in aviation and inter
national law. His immediate re
sponsibilities were his wife and
five children.
Now he has taken on the assign
ment of preparing the entire na
tion for possible enemy nuclear
attack.
HIS CHIEF weapons are a $250
million fund voted by Congress
and a relentless conviction that
apathy has no place in the vocabu
lary of civil defense planners.
The tall, slender Pittman, who
looks as though he would be more
at home in a library than in his
Defense Department office, told
United Press International in an
interview:
“Too many people have the idea
that they’re living in a target area,
that they will be in the center of
a bomb explosion if an attack
comes, and there’s no use doing
onything.
“MY VIEW is that no one knows
whether or not he will be in a
crater because there are all sorts
of attack patterns, and no one
knows which of them the enemy
would select.”
Pittman, whose mild manner
belies the Silver Star he won for
gallantry in action with Marine
guerilla fores off the China coast
in World War 11, also decries the
theory that “life isn’t going to be
worth living after an attack.” He
thinks man could, and . would,
bounce back somehow.
Although Pittman was sworn in
last wek, he started his new job
several days before. His first im
prssion is that nothing about civil
defense is simple. And he is con

vinced that no possibilities should
be overlooked.
He also believes that the real
key to an effective civil defense
does not lie in the $250 million
voted by a Congress which in the
past has shown an extreme skep
ticism about such programs.
“THE MOST difficult job in my
opinion,” he said, “is to determine
how we can make this a nation
wide program, and how we can
giv dirction, guidance and leader
ship to local efforts without im
posing federal control.”
Pittman frankly conceds that
he had no experience in civil de
fense work prior to assuming his
$20,000-a-year post. He hasn’t even
built a home A-bomb shelter al
though he has discussed with
neighbors the idea of a community
shelter. He indicated that other
Americans might want to consider
the idea.
"For myself, if I were away
from home dur ing an attack. I be
live I would rather know that my
wife and children were with the
neighbors in a community shelter
instead of trying to make out in a
shelter of their own.” he said.
“AND THE idea that life isn’t
going to be worth living after an
attack is another thing I don’t
accept.”
The Pentagon’s big drive for
the first year of its new civil de
fense responsibility is to survey
and mark 50 million basement and
other existing underground fall
out shelter spaces. It hopes to
stock at least half of them with
food and water.
Some experts think this mini
mum program might save 15 mil
lion lives in the kind of nuclear
assault which would otherwise
kill 45 million to 50 million Ameri
cans. At the same time, encour
agement will be given to the build
ing of privately-financed home
and community shelters.
PITTMAN, a native of Albany,
N.Y., feels that other “terribly
important” problems are improv
ing attack warning systems and
providing instruments to show the
level of radioactivity inside and
outside of shelters. He favors all
possible steps to impress Ameri
cans that survival is not impos
sible.
“Besides the thought that there
was no hope, a second reason for
public apathy on civil defense has
been unwillingness to look into
such a black hole and contemplate
anything as horrible as a nuclear
war.
“A lot of people have simply
closed their minds to the subject.
But the possibility is a fact of life
which has to be faced, and which
I think will be faced as people
gradually absorb more informa
tion.

Headline in a recent issue of
Life: “A shelter in tme saves
thine and builds national will.”
The story beneath praises Presi
dent Kennedy's allocation request
to begin a national fallout shelter
building campaign, Civil Defense
leaders who are actively promot
ing fallout shelters, and the sever
al thousand people who have al
ready built shelters.
This headline needs analyzing
and so does the concept of civil
defense. “A shelter in times saves
thine ...” Saves thine for what?
Civil Defense advocates concur
that Americans who are saved by
shelters will emerge after a while
and will promptly begin to re
build the institutions of democ
racy. Such persons must believe
in good fairies.

ANYONE with even a super
ficial knowledge of history knows
that democracy, like a rare tropi
cal plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow. Democ
racy cannot flourish in a sea of
social and economic backward
ness. The problems Africa, South
east Asia, and Latin America are

having with democratic concepts
and institutions afford excellent
examples.
Will anyone deny that a nuclear
war replete with “saturation at
tacks” will create a condition of
havoc, chaos, and disunity much
worse than anything now existing
in the underdeveloped countries?
Can a realistic person possibly en
visage representative government,
equality before the law, etc., in
such chaos?
Anarchy would prevail, soon
giving way to a feudal system in
which the many weak and desti
tute would serve a lord who prom
ised them protection and food in
return for services rendered.
WHO WOULD be the lords?
Possibly the men who stored more
weapons in their shelters, or the
military men who are building
excellent protection for them
selves. Or possibly it would be
men who, like Attila the Hun,
would roam the countryside with
a hearty band of cutthroats, sub
duing men with sword and cross'
bow.
You will say that democracy

may grow from the feudal .state,
much as our present day democ
racy grew from the Middle Ages.
True, it may. But why regress to
a political, cultural, and social
level equal to the Middle Ages
when we have spent so much time
and blood building what we have?
Men who build fallout shelters
believe that war is inevitable.
They are willing to concede every
thing. Just “let us stay alive!”
REALISTIC? Yes, this is real
istic. It is realism stripped of all
human dignity and human values.
It is the realism that you find in
the animal kingdom. It is a real
ism that does not befit a race en
dowed with intelligence and forti
tude. It is a realism based on de
featism. Civil defense advocates
are like the ostrich who thinks he
is safe from danger by sticking
his head into the ground.
As for the second part of the
headline. I fail to see how a na
tional building campaign will
“build national will.” It will do
the opposite. Men will not build
their shelters with a feeling of
national purpose.
They will build with a feeling
of individual purpose: a feeling
based on saving one’s own life and
the lives of his family. No matter
how much you rationalize and
twist phrases, you cannot make
the building of fallout shelters a
“social project.”
FURTHERMORE, do civil de
fense advocates really believe
that fallout shelters promote na
tional will? For instance, they
tell people to include a gun among
the necessities in a shelter, for
those without shelters will be
starving to death and will want
your food. In which case, shoot
them. The same principle applies
even if everyone has a fallout

shelter. When it is all clear, some
people will emerge without food
and will take YOUP, FOOD if
you have some left. In which case,
shoot them. “Promotion of na
tional will.”
No one should deny civil defense
advocates the right to say what
they believe. As a student, I only

ask that their beliefs be based on
reason.lf they have no reasonable
arguments (and I believe they
don’t), then let us forget this fall
out shelter foolishness and start
to think of other, more desirable
ways to survive, not only a nu
clear attack, but more important
ly, as human beings.

weapons in their shelters, or the
military men who are building
excellent protection for them
selves. Or possibly it would be

a hearty band of cutthroats, sub

You will say that democracy

True, it may. But why regress to
a political, cultural, and social
level equal to the Middle Ages
when we have spent so much time
and blood building what we have?
Men who build fallout shelters
believe that war is inevitable.
They are willing to concede every
thing. Just “let us stay alive!”
REALISTIC? Yes, this is real
istic. It is realism stripped of all
human dignity and human values.
It is the realism that you find in
the animal kingdom. It is a real
ism that does not befit a race en
dowed with intelligence and forti
tude. It is a realism based on de
featism. Civil defense advocates
are like the ostrich who thinks he
is safe from danger by sticking
his head into the ground.
As for the second part of the
headline. I fail to see how a na
tional building campaign will
“build national will.” It will do
the opposite. Men will not build
their shelters with a feeling of
national purpose.
They will build with a feeling
of individual purpose: a feeling
based on saving one’s own life and
the lives of his family. No matter
how much you rationalize and
twist phrases, you cannot make
the building of fallout shelters a
“social project.”
FURTHERMORE, do civil de
fense advocates really believe
that fallout shelters promote na
tional will? For instance, they
tell people to include a gun among
the necessities in a shelter, for
those without shelters will be
starving to death and will want
your food. In which case, shoot
them. The same principle applies
even if everyone has a fallout

shelter. When it is all clear, some
people will emerge without food
and will take YOUP, FOOD if
you have some left. In which case,
shoot them. “Promotion of na
tional will.”
No one should deny civil defense
advocates the right to say what
they believe. As a student, I only

ask that their beliefs be based on
reason.lf they have no reasonable
arguments (and I believe they
don’t), then let us forget this fall
out shelter foolishness and start
to think of other, more desirable
ways to survive, not only a nu
clear attack, but more important
ly, as human beings.
WASHINGTON (UPI) “No
one is a dead duck!
“The man who thinks his area
is the most vulnerable may very
well be one of those who will sur
vive and help put this country
back together again.”
Speaking was Steuart L. Pitt
man, 42, until recently a relatively
unknown Washington attorney
specializing in aviation and inter
national law. His immediate re
sponsibilities were his wife and
five children.
Now he has taken on the assign
ment of preparing the entire na
tion for possible enemy nuclear
attack.
HIS CHIEF weapons are a $250
million fund voted by Congress
and a relentless conviction that
apathy has no place in the vocabu
lary of civil defense planners.
The tall, slender Pittman, who
looks as though he would be more
at home in a library than in his
Defense Department office, told
United Press International in an
interview:
“Too many people have the idea
that they’re living in a target area,
that they will be in the center of
a bomb explosion if an attack

onything.
“MY VIEW is that no one knows
whether or not he will be in a

of attack patterns, and no one
knows which of them the enemy

Pittman, whose mild manner
belies the Silver Star he won for
gallantry in action with Marine
guerilla fores off the China coast
in World War 11, also decries the
theory that “life isn’t going to be
worth living after an attack.” He
thinks man could, and . would,
bounce back somehow.
Although Pittman was sworn in
last wek, he started his new job
several days before. His first im
prssion is that nothing about civil
defense is simple. And he is con

vinced that no possibilities should
be overlooked.
He also believes that the real
key to an effective civil defense
does not lie in the $250 million
voted by a Congress which in the
past has shown an extreme skep
ticism about such programs.
“THE MOST difficult job in my
opinion,” he said, “is to determine
how we can make this a nation
wide program, and how we can
giv dirction, guidance and leader
ship to local efforts without im
posing federal control.”
Pittman frankly conceds that
he had no experience in civil de
fense work prior to assuming his
$20,000-a-year post. He hasn’t even
built a home A-bomb shelter al
though he has discussed with
neighbors the idea of a community
shelter. He indicated that other
Americans might want to consider
the idea.
"For myself, if I were away
from home dur ing an attack. I be
live I would rather know that my
wife and children were with the
neighbors in a community shelter
instead of trying to make out in a
shelter of their own.” he said.
“AND THE idea that life isn’t
going to be worth living after an
attack is another thing I don’t
accept.”
The Pentagon’s big drive for
the first year of its new civil de
fense responsibility is to survey
and mark 50 million basement and
other existing underground fall
out shelter spaces. It hopes to
stock at least half of them with
food and water.
Some experts think this mini
mum program might save 15 mil
lion lives in the kind of nuclear
assault which would otherwise
kill 45 million to 50 million Ameri
cans. At the same time, encour
agement will be given to the build
ing of privately-financed home
and community shelters.
PITTMAN, a native of Albany,
N.Y., feels that other “terribly
important” problems are improv
ing attack warning systems and
providing instruments to show the
level of radioactivity inside and
outside of shelters. He favors all
possible steps to impress Ameri
cans that survival is not impos
sible.
“Besides the thought that there
was no hope, a second reason for
public apathy on civil defense has
been unwillingness to look into
such a black hole and contemplate
anything as horrible as a nuclear
war.
“A lot of people have simply
closed their minds to the subject.
But the possibility is a fact of life
which has to be faced, and which
I think will be faced as people
gradually absorb more informa

Headline in a recent issue of
Life: “A shelter in tme saves
thine and builds national will.”
The story beneath praises Presi
dent Kennedy's allocation request
to begin a national fallout shelter
building campaign, Civil Defense
leaders who are actively promot
ing fallout shelters, and the sever
al thousand people who have al
ready built shelters.
This headline needs analyzing
and so does the concept of civil
defense. “A shelter in times saves
thine ...” Saves thine for what?
Civil Defense advocates concur
that Americans who are saved by
shelters will emerge after a while
and will promptly begin to re
build the institutions of democ
racy. Such persons must believe
in good fairies.

ANYONE with even a super
ficial knowledge of history knows
that democracy, like a rare tropi
cal plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow. Democ
racy cannot flourish in a sea of
social and economic backward
ness. The problems Africa, South
east Asia, and Latin America are

having with democratic concepts
and institutions afford excellent
examples.
Will anyone deny that a nuclear
war replete with “saturation at
tacks” will create a condition of
havoc, chaos, and disunity much
worse than anything now existing
in the underdeveloped countries?
Can a realistic person possibly en
visage representative government,
equality before the law, etc., in
such chaos?
Anarchy would prevail, soon
giving way to a feudal system in
which the many weak and desti
tute would serve a lord who prom
ised them protection and food in
return for services rendered.
WHO WOULD be the lords?
Possibly the men who stored more
weapons in their shelters, or the
military men who are building

Headline in a recent issue of
Life: “A shelter in tme saves
thine and builds national will.”
The story beneath praises Presi
dent Kennedy's allocation request
to begin a national fallout shelter
building campaign, Civil Defense
leaders who are actively promot
ing fallout shelters, and the sever
al thousand people who have al
ready built shelters.
This headline needs analyzing
and so does the concept of civil
defense. “A shelter in times saves
thine ...” Saves thine for what?
Civil Defense advocates concur
that Americans who are saved by
shelters will emerge after a while
and will promptly begin to re
build the institutions of democ
racy. Such persons must believe
in good fairies.

ANYONE with even a super
ficial knowledge of history knows
that democracy, like a rare tropi
cal plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow. Democ
racy cannot flourish in a sea of
social and economic backward
ness. The problems Africa, South
east Asia, and Latin America are

having with democratic concepts
and institutions afford excellent
examples.
Will anyone deny that a nuclear
war replete with “saturation at
tacks” will create a condition of
havoc, chaos, and disunity much
worse than anything now existing
in the underdeveloped countries?
Can a realistic person possibly en
visage representative government,
equality before the law, etc., in
such chaos?
Anarchy would prevail, soon
giving way to a feudal system in
which the many weak and desti
tute would serve a lord who prom
ised them protection and food in
return for services rendered.
WHO WOULD be the lords?
Possibly the men who stored more
weapons in their shelters, or the
military men who are building
excellent protection for them
selves. Or possibly it would be
men who, like Attila the Hun,
would roam the countryside with
a hearty band of cutthroats, sub
duing men with sword and cross'
bow.
You will say that democracy

may grow from the feudal .state,
much as our present day democ
racy grew from the Middle Ages.
True, it may. But why regress to
a political, cultural, and social
level equal to the Middle Ages
when we have spent so much time
and blood building what we have?
Men who build fallout shelters
believe that war is inevitable.
They are willing to concede every
thing. Just “let us stay alive!”
REALISTIC? Yes, this is real
istic. It is realism stripped of all
human dignity and human values.
It is the realism that you find in
the animal kingdom. It is a real
ism that does not befit a race en
dowed with intelligence and forti
tude. It is a realism based on de
featism. Civil defense advocates
are like the ostrich who thinks he
is safe from danger by sticking
his head into the ground.
As for the second part of the
headline. I fail to see how a na
tional building campaign will
“build national will.” It will do
the opposite. Men will not build
their shelters with a feeling of
national purpose.
They will build with a feeling
of individual purpose: a feeling
based on saving one’s own life and
the lives of his family. No matter
how much you rationalize and
twist phrases, you cannot make
the building of fallout shelters a
“social project.”
FURTHERMORE, do civil de
fense advocates really believe
that fallout shelters promote na
tional will? For instance, they
tell people to include a gun among
the necessities in a shelter, for
those without shelters will be
starving to death and will want
your food. In which case, shoot
them. The same principle applies
even if everyone has a fallout

shelter. When it is all clear, some
people will emerge without food
and will take YOUP, FOOD if
you have some left. In which case,
shoot them. “Promotion of na
tional will.”
No one should deny civil defense
advocates the right to say what
they believe. As a student, I only

ask that their beliefs be based on
reason.lf they have no reasonable
arguments (and I believe they
don’t), then let us forget this fall

to think of other, more desirable
ways to survive, not only a nu
clear attack, but more important

WASHINGTON (UPI) “No
one is a dead duck!
“The man who thinks his area
is the most vulnerable may very
well be one of those who will sur
vive and help put this country
back together again.”
Speaking was Steuart L. Pitt
man, 42, until recently a relatively
unknown Washington attorney
specializing in aviation and inter
national law. His immediate re
sponsibilities were his wife and
five children.
Now he has taken on the assign
ment of preparing the entire na
tion for possible enemy nuclear
attack.
HIS CHIEF weapons are a $250
million fund voted by Congress
and a relentless conviction that
apathy has no place in the vocabu
lary of civil defense planners.
The tall, slender Pittman, who
looks as though he would be more
at home in a library than in his
Defense Department office, told
United Press International in an
interview:
“Too many people have the idea
that they’re living in a target area,
that they will be in the center of
a bomb explosion if an attack
comes, and there’s no use doing
onything.
“MY VIEW is that no one knows
whether or not he will be in a
crater because there are all sorts
of attack patterns, and no one
knows which of them the enemy
would select.”
Pittman, whose mild manner
belies the Silver Star he won for
gallantry in action with Marine
guerilla fores off the China coast
in World War 11, also decries the
theory that “life isn’t going to be
worth living after an attack.” He
thinks man could, and . would,
bounce back somehow.
Although Pittman was sworn in
last wek, he started his new job
several days before. His first im
prssion is that nothing about civil
defense is simple. And he is con

vinced that no possibilities should
be overlooked.
He also believes that the real
key to an effective civil defense
does not lie in the $250 million
voted by a Congress which in the
past has shown an extreme skep
ticism about such programs.
“THE MOST difficult job in my
opinion,” he said, “is to determine
how we can make this a nation
wide program, and how we can
giv dirction, guidance and leader
ship to local efforts without im
posing federal control.”
Pittman frankly conceds that
he had no experience in civil de
fense work prior to assuming his
$20,000-a-year post. He hasn’t even
built a home A-bomb shelter al
though he has discussed with
neighbors the idea of a community
shelter. He indicated that other
Americans might want to consider
the idea.
"For myself, if I were away
from home dur ing an attack. I be
live I would rather know that my
wife and children were with the
neighbors in a community shelter
instead of trying to make out in a
shelter of their own.” he said.
“AND THE idea that life isn’t
going to be worth living after an
attack is another thing I don’t
accept.”
The Pentagon’s big drive for
the first year of its new civil de
fense responsibility is to survey
and mark 50 million basement and
other existing underground fall
out shelter spaces. It hopes to
stock at least half of them with
food and water.
Some experts think this mini
mum program might save 15 mil
lion lives in the kind of nuclear

Headline in a recent issue of
Life: “A shelter in tme saves
thine and builds national will.”
The story beneath praises Presi
dent Kennedy's allocation request
to begin a national fallout shelter
building campaign, Civil Defense
leaders who are actively promot
ing fallout shelters, and the sever
al thousand people who have al
ready built shelters.
This headline needs analyzing
and so does the concept of civil
defense. “A shelter in times saves
thine ...” Saves thine for what?
Civil Defense advocates concur
that Americans who are saved by
shelters will emerge after a while
and will promptly begin to re
build the institutions of democ
racy. Such persons must believe
in good fairies.

ANYONE with even a super
ficial knowledge of history knows
that democracy, like a rare tropi
cal plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow. Democ
racy cannot flourish in a sea of
social and economic backward
ness. The problems Africa, South
east Asia, and Latin America are

having with democratic concepts
and institutions afford excellent
examples.
Will anyone deny that a nuclear
war replete with “saturation at
tacks” will create a condition of
havoc, chaos, and disunity much
worse than anything now existing
in the underdeveloped countries?
Can a realistic person possibly en
visage representative government,
equality before the law, etc., in
such chaos?
Anarchy would prevail, soon
giving way to a feudal system in
which the many weak and desti
tute would serve a lord who prom
ised them protection and food in
return for services rendered.
WHO WOULD be the lords?
Possibly the men who stored more
weapons in their shelters, or the
military men who are building
excellent protection for them
selves. Or possibly it would be
men who, like Attila the Hun,
would roam the countryside with
a hearty band of cutthroats, sub
duing men with sword and cross'
bow.
You will say that democracy

may grow from the feudal .state,
much as our present day democ
racy grew from the Middle Ages.
True, it may. But why regress to
a political, cultural, and social
level equal to the Middle Ages
when we have spent so much time
and blood building what we have?
Men who build fallout shelters
believe that war is inevitable.
They are willing to concede every
thing. Just “let us stay alive!”
REALISTIC? Yes, this is real
istic. It is realism stripped of all
human dignity and human values.
It is the realism that you find in
the animal kingdom. It is a real
ism that does not befit a race en
dowed with intelligence and forti
tude. It is a realism based on de
featism. Civil defense advocates
are like the ostrich who thinks he
is safe from danger by sticking
his head into the ground.
As for the second part of the
headline. I fail to see how a na
tional building campaign will
“build national will.” It will do
the opposite. Men will not build
their shelters with a feeling of
national purpose.
They will build with a feeling
of individual purpose: a feeling
based on saving one’s own life and
the lives of his family. No matter
how much you rationalize and
twist phrases, you cannot make
the building of fallout shelters a
“social project.”
FURTHERMORE, do civil de
fense advocates really believe
that fallout shelters promote na
tional will? For instance, they
tell people to include a gun among
the necessities in a shelter, for
those without shelters will be
starving to death and will want
your food. In which case, shoot
them. The same principle applies
even if everyone has a fallout

shelter. When it is all clear, some
people will emerge without food
and will take YOUP, FOOD if
you have some left. In which case,
shoot them. “Promotion of na
tional will.”
No one should deny civil defense
advocates the right to say what
they believe. As a student, I only

ask that their beliefs be based on
reason.lf they have no reasonable
arguments (and I believe they
don’t), then let us forget this fall
out shelter foolishness and start
to think of other, more desirable
ways to survive, not only a nu
clear attack, but more important
ly, as human beings.

It is the realism that you find in
the animal kingdom. It is a real
ism that does not befit a race en
dowed with intelligence and forti
tude. It is a realism based on de
featism. Civil defense advocates
are like the ostrich who thinks he
is safe from danger by sticking
his head into the ground.
As for the second part of the
headline. I fail to see how a na
tional building campaign will
“build national will.” It will do
the opposite. Men will not build
their shelters with a feeling of
national purpose.
They will build with a feeling
of individual purpose: a feeling
based on saving one’s own life and
the lives of his family. No matter
how much you rationalize and
twist phrases, you cannot make
the building of fallout shelters a
“social project.”
FURTHERMORE, do civil de
fense advocates really believe
that fallout shelters promote na
tional will? For instance, they
tell people to include a gun among
the necessities in a shelter, for
those without shelters will be
starving to death and will want
your food. In which case, shoot
them. The same principle applies
even if everyone has a fallout

shelter. When it is all clear, some
people will emerge without food
and will take YOUP, FOOD if
you have some left. In which case,
shoot them. “Promotion of na
tional will.”
No one should deny civil defense
advocates the right to say what
they believe. As a student, I only

ask that their beliefs be based on
reason.lf they have no reasonable
arguments (and I believe they
don’t), then let us forget this fall
out shelter foolishness and start
to think of other, more desirable
ways to survive, not only a nu
clear attack, but more important
ly, as human beings.
WASHINGTON (UPI) “No
one is a dead duck!
“The man who thinks his area
is the most vulnerable may very
well be one of those who will sur
vive and help put this country
back together again.”
Speaking was Steuart L. Pitt
man, 42, until recently a relatively
unknown Washington attorney
specializing in aviation and inter
national law. His immediate re
sponsibilities were his wife and
five children.
Now he has taken on the assign
ment of preparing the entire na
tion for possible enemy nuclear
attack.
HIS CHIEF weapons are a $250
million fund voted by Congress
and a relentless conviction that
apathy has no place in the vocabu
lary of civil defense planners.
The tall, slender Pittman, who
looks as though he would be more
at home in a library than in his
Defense Department office, told
United Press International in an
interview:
“Too many people have the idea
that they’re living in a target area,
that they will be in the center of
a bomb explosion if an attack
comes, and there’s no use doing
onything.
“MY VIEW is that no one knows
whether or not he will be in a
crater because there are all sorts
of attack patterns, and no one
knows which of them the enemy
would select.”
Pittman, whose mild manner
belies the Silver Star he won for
gallantry in action with Marine
guerilla fores off the China coast
in World War 11, also decries the
theory that “life isn’t going to be
worth living after an attack.” He
thinks man could, and . would,
bounce back somehow.
Although Pittman was sworn in
last wek, he started his new job
several days before. His first im
prssion is that nothing about civil
defense is simple. And he is con

vinced that no possibilities should
be overlooked.
He also believes that the real
key to an effective civil defense
does not lie in the $250 million
voted by a Congress which in the
past has shown an extreme skep
ticism about such programs.
“THE MOST difficult job in my
opinion,” he said, “is to determine
how we can make this a nation
wide program, and how we can
giv dirction, guidance and leader
ship to local efforts without im
posing federal control.”
Pittman frankly conceds that
he had no experience in civil de
fense work prior to assuming his
$20,000-a-year post. He hasn’t even
built a home A-bomb shelter al
though he has discussed with
neighbors the idea of a community
shelter. He indicated that other
Americans might want to consider
the idea.
"For myself, if I were away
from home dur ing an attack. I be
live I would rather know that my
wife and children were with the
neighbors in a community shelter
instead of trying to make out in a
shelter of their own.” he said.
“AND THE idea that life isn’t
going to be worth living after an
attack is another thing I don’t
accept.”
The Pentagon’s big drive for
the first year of its new civil de
fense responsibility is to survey
and mark 50 million basement and
other existing underground fall
out shelter spaces. It hopes to
stock at least half of them with
food and water.
Some experts think this mini
mum program might save 15 mil
lion lives in the kind of nuclear
assault which would otherwise
kill 45 million to 50 million Ameri
cans. At the same time, encour
agement will be given to the build
ing of privately-financed home
and community shelters.
PITTMAN, a native of Albany,
N.Y., feels that other “terribly
important” problems are improv
ing attack warning systems and
providing instruments to show the
level of radioactivity inside and
outside of shelters. He favors all
possible steps to impress Ameri
cans that survival is not impos
sible.
“Besides the thought that there
was no hope, a second reason for
public apathy on civil defense has
been unwillingness to look into
such a black hole and contemplate
anything as horrible as a nuclear
war.
“A lot of people have simply
closed their minds to the subject.
But the possibility is a fact of life
which has to be faced, and which
I think will be faced as people
gradually absorb more informa
tion.

Headline in a recent issue of
Life: “A shelter in tme saves
thine and builds national will.”
The story beneath praises Presi
dent Kennedy's allocation request
to begin a national fallout shelter
building campaign, Civil Defense
leaders who are actively promot
ing fallout shelters, and the sever
al thousand people who have al
ready built shelters.
This headline needs analyzing
and so does the concept of civil
defense. “A shelter in times saves
thine ...” Saves thine for what?
Civil Defense advocates concur
that Americans who are saved by
shelters will emerge after a while
and will promptly begin to re
build the institutions of democ
racy. Such persons must believe
in good fairies.

ANYONE with even a super
ficial knowledge of history knows
that democracy, like a rare tropi
cal plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow. Democ
racy cannot flourish in a sea of
social and economic backward
ness. The problems Africa, South
east Asia, and Latin America are

having with democratic concepts
and institutions afford excellent
examples.
Will anyone deny that a nuclear
war replete with “saturation at
tacks” will create a condition of
havoc, chaos, and disunity much
worse than anything now existing
in the underdeveloped countries?
Can a realistic person possibly en
visage representative government,
equality before the law, etc., in
such chaos?
Anarchy would prevail, soon
giving way to a feudal system in
which the many weak and desti
tute would serve a lord who prom
ised them protection and food in
return for services rendered.
WHO WOULD be the lords?
Possibly the men who stored more
weapons in their shelters, or the
military men who are building
excellent protection for them
selves. Or possibly it would be
men who, like Attila the Hun,
would roam the countryside with
a hearty band of cutthroats, sub
duing men with sword and cross'
bow.
You will say that democracy

may grow from the feudal .state,
much as our present day democ
racy grew from the Middle Ages.
True, it may. But why regress to
a political, cultural, and social
level equal to the Middle Ages
when we have spent so much time
and blood building what we have?
Men who build fallout shelters
believe that war is inevitable.
They are willing to concede every
thing. Just “let us stay alive!”
REALISTIC? Yes, this is real
istic. It is realism stripped of all
human dignity and human values.
It is the realism that you find in
the animal kingdom. It is a real
ism that does not befit a race en
dowed with intelligence and forti
tude. It is a realism based on de
featism. Civil defense advocates
are like the ostrich who thinks he
is safe from danger by sticking
his head into the ground.
As for the second part of the
headline. I fail to see how a na
tional building campaign will
“build national will.” It will do
the opposite. Men will not build
their shelters with a feeling of
national purpose.
They will build with a feeling
of individual purpose: a feeling

the lives of his family. No matter

fense advocates really believe

tional will? For instance, they
