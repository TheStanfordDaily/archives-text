# Pooh Society to Convene Today
## 
### 
A summer of wild prosyletizing
by Pooh Society members has re
vealed that the immortal words
of our beloved A. A. Milne have
an undeniable universality.
Branches were established in
Istanbul, Kampala and Florence
through the efforts of Rabbit,
Roo and other friends and rela
tions.
An office in Addis Ababa has
been functioning since last year.
The Most Reverential Society of
Pooh expects to begin meditation
soon in Kyoto.
Moreover, a Tibetan monastery
has expressed interest, and a cul
tural exchange is being contem
plated as one method of fighting
Chinese thought control.
In an effort to evaluate the
progress of the Society, a short
meeting and hum will be held
this afternoon at five at the home
of Christopher Robin 11. All mem
bers, friends and relations are
asked to be present.
