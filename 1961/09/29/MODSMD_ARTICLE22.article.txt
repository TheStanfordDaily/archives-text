Tomorrow is the day when Stan
ford football fans will be given a
chance at an honest appraisal of
the 1961 squad. The battle is with
Oregon State one of the top
outfits on the coast with affairs
commencing at 1:30 p.m. in Cor
valis, Ore.
Stanford is a 12Va point under
dog.
PERHAPS this game Will de
pend on the Indian defense, which
put on such a determined team ef
fort last Saturday against Tulane.
The hard rush of tackles C. B. Si
mons and Frank Atkinson led a
charge against the Green Wave
which had the New Orleans back
field looking over its shoulders.
STANFORD COACH Cactus
Jack Curtice has been working the

team hard on defense most of the
week and hopes that it will come
up with an even fiercer perform
ance tomorrow. To contain the
fleet and talented Beaver backfield
it will have to.
Led by the brilliant Terry Baker,
Oregon gave powerful Syracuse a
tough fight last week before
bowing 19-8. If not for two fum
bles inside their own 30-yard line
OSC might have pulled off one of
the major upsets of the season.
Oregon State tallied its lone
touchdown on a makeshift 36-yard
jaunt by Baker. The elusive quar
terback was chased all the way
back to his own 48-yard line before
finally turning the right way and
side-stepping the entire Syracuse
team.
ALONG with Baker in the back
field will be slashing Don Kasso
and Hank Rivera as the halfbacks
and Tom Gates at fullback.
It was the presence of Kasso
and Baker, both tremendous tail

backs, which made Beaver Coach
Tom Prothro change this season
from the single wing offense to
the T-formation. Oregon State was
still ironing out some of the wrin
kles last week, but should be start
ing to .jell now.

Stanford employs the T-forma
tion offense.
MOST MAJOR college games,
although the average fan will
often argue the point, are won and
lost in the line. The bruising con
tact up front either opens the hole
through which a fleet halfback
will scoot or closes what was sup
posed to be a hole and the fleet
halfback is clobbered for a loss.
SATURDAY’S GAME should
provide a gladiator arena for
tackles when Oregon State’s Neil
Plunley (6-6, 231) and Mike Kline
(6-0. 224) mix it up with Indians
Frank Atkinson (6-3, 217 and C. B.
Simons (6-1 Vi;, 228).
At guard the Tribe will send out
Errol Scott a 5-11, 218-pound sen
ior from Eureka and Tom Walsh.
Walsh will be playing in front of
many of his old fans, as he lives
in Portland.
Veteran center Chris Cottle will
try to plug up the middle for the
Cards while Steve Pursell and
George Honore will attempt to
keep Baker from sweeping the
ends something which Terry
does very well.
THE REST of the Stanford
backfield will see Gary Craig, Lar
ry Royse, Mike Barnes, Hal Steu
ber and Gary Sargent trading off
the duties. Sargent had the flu
this week, as did Atkinson, but
both are expected to play.
Still on the disabled list are
junior halfback Tim Hansel and
junior quarterback Jim Smith.
Smith sustained a muscle strain
a couple of weeks back and it will
take a while before he is right.
Rounding out OSC’s starting
lineup will he Roger Johnson and

Skip Russell at ends; Mike Dolby
and Norh Keolanui at guards; and
Marne Palmateer at center.
The Beavers boast great depth,
particularly in the backfield
where Leroy Whittle and Bill
MOnk can both adequately fill in
for Kasso and Rivera. Up front
Ross Cariaga, a regular last year,
and George Gnoss will spell the
Beaver starters.
Though they did not show it
against Syracuse, OSC is fully
capable of going into a single wing
with Baker taking the all-import
ant tailback spot.
