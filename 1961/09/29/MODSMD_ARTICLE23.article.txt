It wasn’t that long ago, really, although now it doesn’t seem as
though baseball was ever any other way. Those males anywhere
near the age of the author of these wayward thoughts were just
beginning to pick a big league team upon whose successes or failures
during the summer he would live or die.
Baseball gained thousands of new fans that year, mos* of whom

in a few years. The national
event, crisis even, caused by the
entry of Jackie Robinson into the
national game, drew the attention
of many persons who never knew
that right-handed hitters don’t per
form against right-handed pitch
ers. With the appearances of the
Lary Dobys, the Don Newcombes,
and the Willie Mayses, the focus
of these individuals left baseball
for the most part and went back to
more likely subjects; Henry Wal
lace’s campaign, the UAW’s prdb
lems and anti-lynch laws.
But baseball, happily, has never
been the same. Those who dearly
loved the game, yet had felt under
standable guilt at lining the pock
ets of men too hateful, too short
sighted or too afraid to improve
its standards and self-respect by
tannine such an obvious nool of

talent as the American Negro, began to spend their ticket money with
a happy and joyous abandon. And perhaps the whole country uncon
sciously breathed easier as Brooklyn won pennants and Robinson
stole bases.

Old Ways and Idiots
There were a few teams which clung to the old ways. Some, like
the New York Yankees, because they were doing pretty well without
the Negro and let’s not rush things, fellows; and some, like the Boston
Red Sox and the Detroit Tigers because they were idiots.
The Red Sox, in fact, hold the distinction of being the last team
to hire colored ball players and it was only a very few years ago that
they deigned to do so.
However, the Tigers, with whom we have been conducting an
emotional relationship for years, provide a more interesting exhibit,
one which helps to prove a theory which we have been developing
over the summer. The theory, briefly stated, is that the success of a
major league baseball team is roughly and directly proportional to
the caliber of the Negro players on that team. Of course, this theory
can’t be expected to work all the time iDamyankees), but we think a
pretty good case can be made for it.
Back to the Tigers. It wasn’t very long ago that Detroit hired its
first Negro. His name was Ozzie Virgil and he was an infielder. The
great event came after Walter O. Briggs, a particularly senile old
man who had owned the ball club for years, finally saw that the
usual nonsense about finding the “right” Negro wouldn’t work, and
the Tigers might be faced with a boycott, not only by Detroit’s colored
community, whose size was considerable, but by many whites as well.
As it turned out, Ozzie wasn’t the “right” Negro after all, because,
although he went four for five his first appearance in Detroit, he was
soon riding the bench. He is still with the Tigers, but seldom starts.
Why the Tigers Won
It was several years before the Tigers, no longer under Mr.
Briggs’ munificent ownership, hired another Negro player. In fact it
was this past year, and not one Negro was hired, but two. And it is
our contention that it was the appearance of Jake Wood and Bill
Bruton in Detroit uniforms this season (hat brought the Tigers their
highest finish in 11 years and gave one of the strongest Yankee teams
in history fits until after Labor Day.
Bruton, already an established veteran, was one-third of base
ball’s fastest outfield this year. As for Wood, his baserunning can only
be compared with Jackie Robinson’s. Deliverer of the long ball and
the clutch hit, Wood will gather many Rookie of the Year votes,
though his unspectacular batting average may keep him from the
title.
To continue with the theory, it could be argued. Walter Alston
and the greatest use of the platoon since World War II notwith
standing, that the reason the Reds beat the Dodgers was that Frank
Robinson (Most Valuable Player this year) and Vada Pinson were
worth more than Maury Wills and Willie and Tommie Davis.
Perhaps next year Whitey Ford will stub his toe and the theory
can bo perfected on the American League.
