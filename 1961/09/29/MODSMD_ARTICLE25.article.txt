# BOOTERS STRONG
## Soccer Team Enters Tourney; Defends League Championship 
### GLENN ALFORD 
While most of the talk around the Farm has centered on Stan
ford’s all-winning football team, Tribe Soccer Coach Fred Priddle
has been building a powerhouse to defend the West Coast Soccer
Conference title; won by the Indians last year.
Priddle has a crew of veterans headed by two returning all
conference performers, fullback Dan Farthing and center forward

Emannuel Andah.
The Indians will have a busy
weekend. The conference tourna
ment, held this year at USF, will
pit the Indians against San Jose
State at 2 p.m. on Saturday, and
then, if they win, propel them
against the top teams in the
league Sunday. The tournament
should provide onlookers with a
true indication of the Indians’
strength.
The Indians, despite the many
returnees, will sport four new
faces in the starting lineup.
On defense for Stanford will be
Beau Bianchi, goal, last year’s
regular. Kieuanaka Epafaladito, a
transfer student from Uganda,
and Rich Lonergan will start at
fullbacks. Farthing was late turn
ing out, and will be held back to
give Lonergan needed game ex
perience.
The halfbacks are Rune Enge
brettsen, a regular last season at
inside forward, Rusty Williams, a
veteran halfback, and either Ed
gar Berner or Bill Hatch. Berner
was a first-stringer for the last

three games of the 1960 season,
but Hatch is pressing him for his
job on the varsity.
Up front, Stanford is loaded.
Adam Bianchi, three year letter
man and a second team all-con
ference choice is at right wing,
while the left wing is Mike Tip
pett, a starter last year.
The center forward is Emmanu
el Andah, a unanimous choice for
all-conference. last year’s leading
scorer, and the most dangerous
shooter in the league.
The inside forwards are two
new men. At right inside is Mike
Ero, only a sophomore and on the
left is Albert Nnoli, from Nigeria.
Nnoli drew raves from the USE
coach when practicing with the
Dons, and should make USE sorry
they let him slip through their
fingers.
The Stanford junior varsity
takes on Balboa High School at
11 a.m. Saturday on the varsity
field, while the frosh play at 10
a.m.
