# Indian Polo Squad To Meet Alums Tomorrow
## 
### PETE KING 
Optimism is the byword around the varsity pool this week, as
the Stanford varsity water polo squad looks toward tomorrow’s
clash at 10 a.rn. with the alumni. Reasons for the smiles at poolside
lie in the promising sophomores and in the fact that the team lost
only oik 1 letterman from last season.
Several men have been outstanding at workouts thus far. Don

Buhler, a Fremont sophomore'
who was a standout at guard last
year on the frosh team, is back
again. Another frosh first string
er returning tins year is Pete
Pettigrew, a Glencoe, Illinois,
sophomore who was second high
est scorer for the frosh team.
PERHAPS the most promising
man on the team is George Harri
son, a senior from Berkeley who,
though short on experience, has
picked up the game fast and
whose great speed will be invalu
able to the squad.
Experience will not be lacking
with men like John Bates, all-
AAWU goalie last year, or Bob
Spence, a fine shooter with the
most experience of anyone on the
team. Boh Lorton, a senior from
Atherton, will be a threat at for
ward. Bob was high team scorer
las! -season.
Three more returning lettermen
are junior Roger Johnston, senior
Jack Lorton ( brother of Bob), and
junior Mike Conn, all of whom
look like material for the team’s
top ten players.
STILL OTHERS back for an
other season are Anson Hornsey,
sophomore; Grant Giske, a junior,
and Dick Gregory, a senior who
looks especially good at goalie.
The 1960 frosh team is supply
ing quite a number of players.
Jim Youd, is ;m excellent shooter;
Doug Zwissier. Andy Choy, Bob
Farrell, and Bill Lorton are all
back. Bill is the youngest of the
Lorton brothers, has good speed,
and;-was captain of last-year’s
freshman team.
The water polo schedule has
been expanded from 12 to 15
games this year. The season will
hardly be an easy one, viewing the
competition. Cal was undefeated
hist year and is the favorite again
for 1961. However, Stanford’s 3-9
record of last season should defi
nitely improve and Coach Gaugh
ran foresees many upset victories
for the squad.
