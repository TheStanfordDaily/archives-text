# Giants Triumph Over Pirates
##

By United Press International
Stu Miller pitched out of a
bases-loaded situation in the
eighth inning and blanked the
Pittsburgh Pirates in the ninth to
preserve a 7-4 victory for Rookie
Jim Duffalo and the San Fran
cisco Giants yesterday.
The triumph gave the Giants
the season series between the
clubs, 12 games to 10.
Dick Stuart hit his 33rd home
run and Smokey Burgess added
his 12th, a two-run blast, to stake
Pittsburgh starter Earl Francis to
a 3-0 load after two innings. But
the Giants came back with two
runs in the third and four runs in
tire fifth in sending Francis to his
eighth defeat against two wins.
