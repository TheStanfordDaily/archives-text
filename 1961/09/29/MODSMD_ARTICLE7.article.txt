dio Damascus said early today
that 200 Egyptian paratroopers
dropped on the Syrian port city of
Latakia and were “wiped out” by
rebel forces.
The rebel-held radio also pro

claimed formation of an independ
ent Syrian government.
Simultaneously, an unidentified
Arabic language radio broadcast
said Jordan had recognized the
revolutionary “government in
Syria.”
DAMASCUS Radio said the
Egyptian paratroopers opened
fire on Syrian forces when they
landed. Latakia, Syria’s biggest
harbor, is located on the Medi
terranean opposite Cyprus and 110
miles north of Beirut.
Direct communications between
Syria and the outside world have
been severed since the revolt was
launched early yesterday and al
most the only source of informa
tion was coming from the rebel
broadcasts.
Much of it could not be checked
independently but it seemed clear
that the rebels were firmly en
trenched in Damascus and were
gaining support.
RADIO Aleppo, which had been
broadcasting anti-rebel statements
and support of United Arab Re
public President Gamal Abdel
Nasser all day yesterday, sudden
ly changed its tone last night.
The radio, in the northern part
of Syria, announced on its 11
o’clock cast last night that Alep
po’s civilian governor and the
president and members of Syria’s
National Union Council had
pledged support to the revolution.
The Syrian officers’ uprising
against Nasser and control of
their nation by the Cairo-domi
nated United Arab Republic re
vived the threat of a Communist
takeover in Syria. The revolution
aries were joined by Communists
who demonstrated in the streets
against Nasser and the U.A.R.
In the first of two speeches he
made yesterday, Nasser told the
First Army to recapture the Syri
an capital. The revolt appeared to
end at that time, but it flared up
seven hours later, and Nasser
again gave orders to march.
In his second radio broadcast
in 10 hours, Nasser said last night
"I shall never accept bargaining
or compromise” with the rebels
and warned that they must “ac
cept the consequences of their
action.” He told the troops to “Do
your duty” to crush the revolt.
Nasser’s warnings and his troop
order indicated he planned an all
out military action to smash the
rebellion which he called the
greatest threat to the country
since the Franco-British invasion
of Suez in 1956.
He said the rebels tried to force
vice president Abdel Hakim Amer
and Syrian Army commander
Gen. Gamal Faysal to bargain
with them at army headquarters
in Damascus and to issue state
ments that the rebellion was over.
He said both refused because
Amor did not approve the rebel
communique claiming that the
military situation had returned to
normal. Last night rebel-held Ra
dio Damascus said the revolt had
flared again because the govern
ment did not fulfill its pledges.
Informed sources last night said
the Communists had exploited the
situation to tear down the U.A.R.
flags and pictures of Nasser. They
also raced through the streets
shouting slogans against U.A.R.
and trying to foment further dis
orders.

dio Damascus said early today
that 200 Egyptian paratroopers
dropped on the Syrian port city of
Latakia and were “wiped out” by
rebel forces.
The rebel-held radio also pro

claimed formation of an independ

Simultaneously, an unidentified
Arabic language radio broadcast
said Jordan had recognized the
revolutionary “government in
Syria.”
DAMASCUS Radio said the
Egyptian paratroopers opened
fire on Syrian forces when they
landed. Latakia, Syria’s biggest
harbor, is located on the Medi
terranean opposite Cyprus and 110
miles north of Beirut.
Direct communications between
Syria and the outside world have
been severed since the revolt was

broadcasts.

RADIO Aleppo, which had been
broadcasting anti-rebel statements
and support of United Arab Re
public President Gamal Abdel
Nasser all day yesterday, sudden
ly changed its tone last night.
The radio, in the northern part
of Syria, announced on its 11
o’clock cast last night that Alep
po’s civilian governor and the
president and members of Syria’s
National Union Council had
pledged support to the revolution.
The Syrian officers’ uprising
against Nasser and control of
their nation by the Cairo-domi
nated United Arab Republic re
vived the threat of a Communist
takeover in Syria. The revolution
aries were joined by Communists
who demonstrated in the streets
against Nasser and the U.A.R.
In the first of two speeches he
made yesterday, Nasser told the
First Army to recapture the Syri
an capital. The revolt appeared to
end at that time, but it flared up
seven hours later, and Nasser
again gave orders to march.
In his second radio broadcast
in 10 hours, Nasser said last night
"I shall never accept bargaining
or compromise” with the rebels
and warned that they must “ac
cept the consequences of their
action.” He told the troops to “Do
your duty” to crush the revolt.
Nasser’s warnings and his troop
order indicated he planned an all
out military action to smash the
rebellion which he called the
greatest threat to the country
since the Franco-British invasion
of Suez in 1956.
He said the rebels tried to force
vice president Abdel Hakim Amer
and Syrian Army commander
Gen. Gamal Faysal to bargain
with them at army headquarters
in Damascus and to issue state
ments that the rebellion was over.
He said both refused because
Amor did not approve the rebel
communique claiming that the
military situation had returned to
normal. Last night rebel-held Ra
dio Damascus said the revolt had
flared again because the govern
ment did not fulfill its pledges.
