### 
LOS ANGELES—( UPl)—Former Gov. Goodwin J. Knight said
yesterday he was ottered any state' job up to “Chief Justice of the
California Supreme Court” to stay out of the race for governor. A
top Democratic Party official demanded the state bar investigate the
charge. Knight said the otfer-which he rejected-was made by a
Nixon emissary early this month, prior to Nixon’s announced de-

cision to run for the Republican
nomination next year. Knight also
is a candidate.
A top spokesman for Nixon said
late tonight ho felt Nixon had al
ready answered the question in
his news conference last night
when the former vice president
denied offering a deal to Knight,
or making any commitment to
anyone. The same spokesman
pointed out that since Nixon had
not made his own decision on run
ning until Tuesday, the “story ob
viously could have no basis in
fact.”
Nixon himself still was unavail

able for comment late tonight.
Roger Kent, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Com
mittee, telegraphed Theodore
Meyer, president of the State Bar
of California. He said he request
ed appointment of a committee
“to conduct a full investigation
into Goodwin Knight’s charge
that Richard Nixon offered to
make him Chief Justice of the
California Supreme Court if
Knight would not run against
him for governor.
Knight last night said he was
in the gubernatorial primary to
the finish despite Nixon’s an
nounced candidacy.
Knight said he had two wit
nesses to the telephone call from
the Nixon representative, whom
he identified only as a prominent,
wealthy friend and supporter of
the former vice president.
“It was right after 2 p.m. on
Sept. 7 when I received the tele
phone call,” said Knight. “I knew
what it meant—it was a message
from Nixon. I had two others in
the room lean over and listen.
“He said: T telephoned to tell
you Dick is going to run for gov
ernor.’
“He asked ‘Would you be will
ing to meet with Dick and Bob
Finch.’ I said I would, but I asked
why,” Knight continued.
“Then he said, ‘Dick will be
willing to give you anything you
want in California, including the
supreme court, if you don’t run,’ ”
Knight added.
“ Tell him I am going to run.’
To prove it, I left immediately
from Sacramento and announced
my plans to run the following
w'eek.”
“If Nixon denies this,” Knight
said, “I have proof of the tele
phone call to my private number,
and by witnesses.”
Democratic Gov. Edmund G.
Brown when informed of the re
port said:
“If Knight's charges are true—
and he insists they are—it is the
most shocking political scandal in
the history of this state. If Rich
ard Nixon did offer to sell the
highest judicial office in Califor
nia for a political favor, the pub
lic exposure of his act would re
quire his withdrawal from the
race for governor.”

why,” Knight continued.
“Then he said, ‘Dick will be
willing to give you anything you

supreme court, if you don’t run,’ ”
Knight added.
“ Tell him I am going to run.’
To prove it, I left immediately

“If Nixon denies this,” Knight
said, “I have proof of the tele

Democratic Gov. Edmund G.
Brown when informed of the re
port said:
“If Knight's charges are true—
and he insists they are—it is the
most shocking political scandal in

race for governor.”
LOS ANGELES—( UPl)—Former Gov. Goodwin J. Knight said
yesterday he was ottered any state' job up to “Chief Justice of the
California Supreme Court” to stay out of the race for governor. A
top Democratic Party official demanded the state bar investigate the
charge. Knight said the otfer-which he rejected-was made by a
Nixon emissary early this month, prior to Nixon’s announced de-

cision to run for the Republican
nomination next year. Knight also
is a candidate.
A top spokesman for Nixon said
late tonight ho felt Nixon had al
ready answered the question in
his news conference last night
when the former vice president
denied offering a deal to Knight,
or making any commitment to
anyone. The same spokesman
pointed out that since Nixon had
not made his own decision on run
ning until Tuesday, the “story ob
viously could have no basis in
fact.”
Nixon himself still was unavail

able for comment late tonight.
Roger Kent, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Com
mittee, telegraphed Theodore
Meyer, president of the State Bar
of California. He said he request
ed appointment of a committee
“to conduct a full investigation
into Goodwin Knight’s charge
that Richard Nixon offered to
make him Chief Justice of the
California Supreme Court if
Knight would not run against
him for governor.
Knight last night said he was
in the gubernatorial primary to
the finish despite Nixon’s an
nounced candidacy.
Knight said he had two wit
nesses to the telephone call from
the Nixon representative, whom
he identified only as a prominent,
wealthy friend and supporter of
the former vice president.
“It was right after 2 p.m. on
Sept. 7 when I received the tele
phone call,” said Knight. “I knew
what it meant—it was a message
from Nixon. I had two others in
the room lean over and listen.
“He said: T telephoned to tell
you Dick is going to run for gov
ernor.’
