LOS ANGELES—(UPD—Rich
ard M. Nixon’s declaration that
his decision to run for California
governor in 1962 definitely takes
him out of the running for presi
dent in 1964 was greeted yester
day with open skepticism from
New York Gov. Nelson A. Rocke
feller.
“I don’t think Nixon is out of
the race,” said Rockefeller at Buf
falo, N.Y., when asked about the
1964 presidential campaign. But
he offered to campaign in Nixon’s
behalf for governor “if he asks
me.”

In contrast, Sen. Barry Gold
water of Arizona—like Rockefel
ler a man frequently mentioned
as a 1964 Republican presidential
candidate—said he believed Nixon
when the former vice president
said he would not try to use Cali
fornia’s governorship as a step
ping stone to the White House.
Ho called Nixon’s statement a
“valid, honest promise” to servo
four years if elected.
But neither of the two men
Nixon must beat to become gov
ernor believed the announcement
made Wednesday canceled the
possibility of his running a sec
ond time for president in 1964.
