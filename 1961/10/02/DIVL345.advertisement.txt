SOPHOMORES, JUNIORS, SENIORS: DON’T TREAD ON FRESHMEN! They
have been known to become employers. A freshman wants, above all, to be
inaugurated into your world. Walk him to ciass, teach him longhand, explain
how the Ph.D. wears his tassel, introduce him to Luckies (and tell him how
college students smoke more Luckies than any other regular). You’ll be a
bigger man, and you’ll be able to borrow Luckies from him any time.
