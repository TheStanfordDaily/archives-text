# Stanford Supermen Smash OSU
## Second Half Surge Brings 34-0 Romp 
### KEN DERY 
What probably happened is that
the Stanford football team took
its halftime in a phone booth. Be
cause it was a superman who re
turned to rout Oregon State 34-0.
Certainly no one could have

ever guessed the turn of events
which was to give the Cards their
second win of the season in as
many games. Last year’s record
was 0-10.
ACTUALLY the Tribe weather
ed the blistering speed of the OSU
backfield in the first half to stay
alive, and then got a couple of de
termined offensive surges of their
own stalled after the intermis
sion. Before it all stopped the
Beavers of Coach Tom Prothro
had been physically and mentally
crushed. It may take quite a
while for the men from Corvallis
to recover from this one for they
went in to the game as 12-point
favorites.

A sensational reception by sen
ior Larry Royse early in the third
quarter, after a gambling try for
a first down on a fourth-ancl-one
half yard situation, seemed to
shift the Tribe’s offense from low
to second gear. The pass went
from quarterback Rod Sears to
the former student body president
and covered 38 big yards to the
Oregon State two-yard line.
But Royse almost didn’t get his
chance. With the ball on the Stan
ford 45, fourth down and one-half
yard to go, carrot-topped Sears
looked to the bench for his plan
of action. Cactus Jack Curtice
slammed his fist into the palm of
his other hand and Sears knew it
was now or never. A quarterback
sneak just beat the straining of
ficials’ marking chain and the
drive was allowed to continue.
THREE PLAYS later Royse
was behind the Beaver’s daredevil
safety Hank Rivera. Rivera, who
had been cracking Stanford re
ceivers all afternoon, let Royse get
a couple of steps on him. But even
so, handsome Royse made an un
believable grab. Rivera dove high
into the air just as Royse made
his over the head stab. Who came
up with the ball is now history.
With the pigskin on the two,
substitute fullback Tony Delellis
punched it over. The gambling
Cards, looking for the whole ball
of wax, attempted a two-point con
version as sophomore quarterback
Steve Thurlow rolled out left.
However, the Beavers held and
the score was 6-0. The time was
10:41.
A still-cautious Big Red eleven
kicked off and m.ost of the crowd
of 13,727 anxiously awaited golden
boy Terry Baker to lead the in
evitable countercharge. Baker
tried, but the men from Palo Alto
seemed to really believe that they
might pull off the upset.
SPEEDSTER Leroy Whittle
brought the kick back to the 16
and in came the golden boy and
his friends—Tom Gates a punish
ing, quick fullback; slashing Don
Kasso; and Whittle. But Stanford
was ready. Whittle could get but
a yard at left end and Gates found
no hole over right tackle. Baker’s
short swing pass to Whittle was
held to three yards by the out
standing Stanford pass defense.
Baker punted and Royse called for
4 fair catch at his own 44,
This 56-yard touchdown march
in 14 plays began to look more and
more like the end of the Beavers,
for the Stanford qffense had now
shifted into high gear and the
classic clap which breaks every
huddle could now be heard loud
and crisp all the way to the press
box.
Short dashes by Ed Cummings,
Mike Barnes and Sears combined
for the first ten yards as the Tribe
crossed the midfield strip. Soars,
now appearing extremely cool,
gave it to Royse, the second man
coming through and fleet Larry
was good for ten more. A quick
pitchout over left tackle showed
that Royse’s sprint was no fluke
as he danced for ten more.
WITH THE ball on the Oregon
21, Babajian got four up the mid
dle, Craig got to the 11 and inches
short of a first dowp and it looked
like the Cards were on their way.
But a pass attempt by Sears
backfired and he was thrown for
