BURGOS, Spain (UPI) Gen
eralissimo Francisco Franco said
last night that “circumstances ad
vise the revision of treaties” be
tween the United States and
Spain.
Franco did not say he intended
to withdraw Spain’s permission
for the four United States bases
in Spain.
However, observers believed he
was pointing out the dangers to
Spain inherent in a nuclear war
which the bases may present.
Franco said the weapons in use
by the United States at the time
of the treaty signing are now “out
moded as a consequence of tech
nical advances.”
“That is why, now that four
fifths of the per iod of validity of
the agreements has passed, they
need to be restudied and renewed,
so that they can apply to the new
situation,” he added.
Observers interpreted the state
ment to be a reference to inter
continental ballistic missiles now
in possession of both U.S. and
Soviet forces.
