BERLIN (UPI) - West Berlin
Mayor Willy Brandt predicted to
night there woud be no war over
Berlin. But ho said he believed
Russia wanted to make the iron
curtain division of Germany per
manent.
Brandi told West Berliners
there would be no war because
the Russians know just how far
they can safely go in the Berlin
dispute. But neither, he said, will
there be any Western surrender
over Berlin.
Russia now knows that free
Berlin could be subjugated only
by force, Brandt said. He said the
Soviets also know that any Com
munist force would be countered
with force by the West.
Brandt said Communist at
tempts to create fear and unrest
in West Berlin had failed. There
has been no flight from the sur
rounded city, he said. To the con
trary, the mayor added, the num
ber of persons moving to West
Berlin from the West had actually
increased.
