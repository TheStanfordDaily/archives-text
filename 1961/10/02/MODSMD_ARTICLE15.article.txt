# Goldwater and His 'Solution' to Cuba
## 
### 
Harry Goldwater, a handsome, grey-haired gentleman who rep
resents tlie Cambrian era in the United States Senate, has come
forth with another of In's astounding statements on foreign policy.
In a news dispatch from Idaho last week, he was quoted as pro
posing to end the Cuba situation by imposing “a full embargo, then
a blockade, then action such as sabotage, and finally direct military
intervention.”
\ on ve got to admit, it’s a simple solution to a complex problem—
and we mean simple. Apparently, Brave Barry’s mind has not yet
coped with the problem of what such action would do to U.S. rela
tions with other nations. Presumably, he does not realize it would
shatter one of the few decent U.S. foreign policy actions of the last
nine years—the Alliance for Progress.
South American leaders such as Frondzi, Betancourt and Prado
must walk tightropes between their support of U.S. aims such as
the Alliance, and (he* social desires of their countrymen, a majority
of whom support Castro, and who are quick to accuse their leaders
of swallowing the “imperialist” U.S. line. Should the U.S. take
action against Cuba such as the senator suggests, we would expect
to sec the Alliance topple, and with it a number of talented, friendly
Latin leaders. Their successors would most likely he social revolu
tionists—not bad in themselves, except that Communists woidd have
a large say in many of the new governments.
Another rather significant drawback to Sen. Goldwater’s “solu
tion is the ideal that one nation simply does not use force to depose
another government because it does not agree with the way that
country is being run.
If the U.S. does not adhere to that principle in this day of ex
tremely proud, nationalistic nations, then our clays as a leading na
tion (and as a free one) are numbered. Contrary to what many
conservatives would like to believe, the United States must listen
to and show respect for the opinions of other nations, regardless of
their size or importance. Not to do so will be fatal in the long run.
And them there is the point that the action advocated by Sen.
Goldwater might halt a revolution whose aims are good, as even
President Kennedy and President Eisenhower have admitted. It
does not seem logical to call for an end to a government by forceful
means simply because one does not agree with or like its leader and
some of his methods.
We would prefer to see the U.S. offering aid to Cuba and calling
tor Castro to open negotiations to reestablish diplomatic relations
between the two nations—and perhaps persuading the Cuban leader
to join in the Alliance for Progress. Castro is in trouble on many
fronts, and Communist aid will not solve his problems. By some
old-fashioned diplomatic tact and skill, we think the U.S. and Cuba
could be brought together and normal relations restored.
Certainly, Goldwaters to the contrary, the effort must be made.

If the U.S. does not adhere to that principle in this day of ex
tremely proud, nationalistic nations, then our clays as a leading na

conservatives would like to believe, the United States must listen
to and show respect for the opinions of other nations, regardless of
their size or importance. Not to do so will be fatal in the long run.

Goldwater might halt a revolution whose aims are good, as even
President Kennedy and President Eisenhower have admitted. It
does not seem logical to call for an end to a government by forceful
means simply because one does not agree with or like its leader and
some of his methods.
We would prefer to see the U.S. offering aid to Cuba and calling
tor Castro to open negotiations to reestablish diplomatic relations
between the two nations—and perhaps persuading the Cuban leader
to join in the Alliance for Progress. Castro is in trouble on many
fronts, and Communist aid will not solve his problems. By some
old-fashioned diplomatic tact and skill, we think the U.S. and Cuba
could be brought together and normal relations restored.
Certainly, Goldwaters to the contrary, the effort must be made.
Harry Goldwater, a handsome, grey-haired gentleman who rep
resents tlie Cambrian era in the United States Senate, has come
forth with another of In's astounding statements on foreign policy.
In a news dispatch from Idaho last week, he was quoted as pro
posing to end the Cuba situation by imposing “a full embargo, then
a blockade, then action such as sabotage, and finally direct military
intervention.”
\ on ve got to admit, it’s a simple solution to a complex problem—
and we mean simple. Apparently, Brave Barry’s mind has not yet
coped with the problem of what such action would do to U.S. rela
tions with other nations. Presumably, he does not realize it would
shatter one of the few decent U.S. foreign policy actions of the last
nine years—the Alliance for Progress.
South American leaders such as Frondzi, Betancourt and Prado
must walk tightropes between their support of U.S. aims such as
the Alliance, and (he* social desires of their countrymen, a majority
of whom support Castro, and who are quick to accuse their leaders
of swallowing the “imperialist” U.S. line. Should the U.S. take
action against Cuba such as the senator suggests, we would expect
to sec the Alliance topple, and with it a number of talented, friendly
Latin leaders. Their successors would most likely he social revolu
tionists—not bad in themselves, except that Communists woidd have
a large say in many of the new governments.
