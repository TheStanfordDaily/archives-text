# Communist Help Okay?
## 
### 
A point recently was made in the letters column of The Daily
which we think deserves some attention. Briefly stated, it is this:
Does the fact that a man is a member of an organization with whose
means and goals we don’t agree necessarily invalidate everything
he says? We feel that the answer to this must be no.
If a Nazi says that two and two are four, must the arithmetic
process be questioned? If a Communist praises the Salk vaccine,
must we suspect it? These questions are obviously rhetorical. Let’s
go a step further.
If a Communist or Nazi or left-handed cricket player is willing
to help us defend our civil liberties, we are prepared to accept that
help. And by the same token we are determined to defend then
civil liberties. The downgrading of the rights of any must invari
ably damage the rights of all.
Statements of fact or opinion must he treated as worthwhile
until proven otherwise, no matter who says them. It is ridiculous
to say that a given utterance is untrue merely because we disagree
with the philosophy of whoever said it.
