By United Press International
The Security Council takes up
again today the tangled question
of admitting Outer Mongolia and
newly independent Mauritania to
U.N. membership. Nationalist Chi
nese and Soviet vetoes appear
likely.
Russia demands that Outer
Mongolia and Mauritania be ad
mitted in a package deal. The
Nationalists said they will veto
Outer Mongolia’s admission on
grounds the sprawling country
between Red China and Siberia
is actually part of China.

The Russians said they will veto
Mauritania’s admission if the Na
tionalists cast their veto. Consul
tations since the Security Council
adjourned last Tuesday night
have not changed the situation
and no immediate solution was in
sight.
The General Assembly, in ad
journment since last Thursday
morning to pay respects to the
late Secretary General Dag Ham
marskjold at his funeral, will con
tinue its annual policy debate to
day.
