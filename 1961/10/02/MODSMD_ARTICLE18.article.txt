Editor, The Daily:
Here are a few comments in
passing showing my feelings
about portions of “Walter Lipp
mann, On Hammarskjold” ... in
your Sept. 28 issue.
To quote Lippmann: “Over the
years I have wondered whether
Dag Hammarskjold belonged to
an age that is passing or to one
that is just being born.” Ham
marskjold belonged to a new age,
an age which we will have a great
part in bringing to maturity. I
don’t mean to say that by the time
we die this age will be an old man,
but that this age will be farther
along toward maturity than it
was 50 or 60 years ago.
The age about which I am
speaking is the age of a world,
organization of peoples founded
on the hope that all men . , . can
live together in peace.
A fundamental organ of this
age is the United Nations. . . '.
Don’t be disillusioned. This organ
ization is a long way from being
mature. Its real form and meaning
cannot even be ‘guessed at today.
Only through continued and re
doubled effort can people be mold
ed together into some sort of
working system of this type.
Again to quote Lippmann: “It
is easy to say that the world is
not ready for international action
to establish peace, and it would
be hard to refute such a state
ment.” Here let me make an at
tempt. Peoples’ fears of the un
tried and the unknown is the only
thing which holds them back from
new r and far belter things.
We aren’t without the means to
father this new age. I have al
ready mentioned the U.N. Of far
greater importance is the work
which can he done with our own
minds and attitudes.
New organizations are forming
daily around this ideal. On our
. . . campus organizations like the
HR and the Political Union afford
an outlet for information, and a
place to speak where someone can
hear' you.
The idea w’hich I support . . .
isn’t something in the future. As I
have said ... it is a new age just
being born. I believe we must sup
port it for in it lies our hope for
security and progress.

Editor, The Daily:
I have always found it difficult
to understand those, who with
moral indignation, oppose the con
struction of nuclear bomb shel
ters. The article and editorial ap
pearing in (Friday’s) Daily has
only added to this difficulty.
There is nothing immoral in
providing for human survival!
And any objective investigation
will indicate that in case of a nu

clear war, a possibility that can
not be rule,cl out in our times, nu
clear bomb shelters will save
lives—many millions of lives.
But the opponents question the
quality of the life saved. They
talk about one family shooting
another, one city herding off refu
gees from another city, in other
words, a Darwinian jungle. But in
typical fashion they have grossly
biased the data. They have not
shown that this extreme behavior
will be the typical behavior of the
vast majority of the people. I can
only ask that these moral peace
lovers not assume that they have
a monopoly on morality and do
assume that the rest of the popu
lation share some of their noble
virtues.
Yes, I would agree that he who
builds a bomb shelter as an escape
from responsibility is indeed like
the ostrich. But, too, I consider it
irresponsible not to plan for the
possibility that all our peace mis
sions might fail.
I will urge President Kennedy
to engage in every feasible peace
making mission, 1 will support the
weak, yet present, peace-making
role of the United Nations. But
there are almost three billion
other independent people on this
earth, and there is no certainty
that they will all always act sane
ly. And if the peacemakers in
high places and the peacemakers
in insignificant places like me fail
to restrain the belligerence of
man, then I, for one, want to sur
vive, ready for the worst when I
emerge from my shelter two
weeks later, but prepared to pitch
in and start all over, perhaps
along a more peaceful path this
time.

Editor, The Daily;
In a letter of Sept, 28, Mr. Eric
Valentine objected to the admis
sion of Red China into the United
Nations because he felt that the
Charter would be compromised.
Pie implied by his righteous indig
nation that the present members
of the U.N. conform more or less
to Chapter I, Article 2, Section 4 of
the Charter which reads in part:
“All Members shall refrain in
their international relations from
the threat or use of force against
the territorial integrity or politi
cal independence of any state . . .”
The United States, as a nation,
has been committed for some time
to a forelgii policy of threatening
massive retaliation with nuclear
weapons upon an aggressor, and'
the U.S. itself is to decide not only
who the aggressor is but also
when and where it shall retaliate.
The U.S. is currently threatening
the use of nuclear arms if the
Berlin air corridors are violated.

The U.S. has consistently violated
the territorial integrity of other
nations, not only recently as in
Cuba and Guatemala, but also
throughout its history: in Canada,
in Mexico, in Columbia, in Iceland.
The U.S. is presently supporting
a government on Formosa which
has openly stated that the inva
sion and conquest of Red China is
its goal. The U.S. has spent more
money for war and war purposes
that it has accumulated in nation
al wealth; 85 per cent of its budg
et has gone directly or indirectly
for war preparation or war itself.
The U.S.S.R. has an equally bad
record: in Estonia, in Latvia, in
Lithuania, in Finland, in Poland,
in Germany, in Hungary. Neither
Great Britain nor France are vir
gins. This being the case, what is
to be done?
I think we should face matters
squarely: the Charter in Chapter
11, Article 5 provides for the ex
pulsion of members from the
United Nations. Either the U.S.,
the U.S.S.R., Great Britain, and
France ought to be expelled, or
we ought to seriously reconsider
not admitting Red China into the
United Nations on the grounds
which Mr. Valentine recommends.
