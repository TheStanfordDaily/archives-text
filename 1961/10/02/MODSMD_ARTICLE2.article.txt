# Radar Dish Erected On SU Campus
## 
### 
America’s biggest radio tele
scope “dish" was erected on the
Stanford campus last Saturday.
The Stanford dish, a 70-ton, 150-
foot, steel and aluminum parab
olic antenna, was designed and
built by Stanford Research Insti
tute scientists under support of
the Air Force Office of Aerospace
Research and the Defense Support
Agency. It is the first of three
such radio-telescopes in the United
States.
THE Alii Force will shortly
raise another at its Sagamore
Hill Radio Astronomy Observa
tory in Massachusetts, while the
Navy will put one on the Virginia
coast. All are designed and built
by the Stanford Research Insti
tute (SRI).
A giant 600-foot dish in West
Virginia has been under construc
tion for several years by the
Navy. The world’s largest at pres
ent is a 250-foot dish at Jordel
Bank in England.
BESIDE THE Stanford dish
stands a huge 20-25 megacycle
radio transmitter operated by Uni
versity scientists with the support
of the Air Force Cambridge Re
search Laboratories. The trans
mitter’s million-watt input will
give the dish a 300-400 kilowatt
radar probe with which to explore
the sun, moon, and interplanetary
gases.
Mounted, the near-half-acre
aluminum mesh surface of the
dish will stand 160-feet high, and
can be pointed to any sector of the
heavens.
BECAUSE OF the joint SRI-
Stanford project's importance to
radio and radar astronomy, Stan
ford trustees passed a special
resolution exempting it from their
long-standing ban on visible struc
tures among the University’s foot
hills.
