Editor, Tile Daily:
I regret that I must take excep
tion to your editorial of Sept. 29.
Somehow you have divined that
fact that nuclear war will mean
total annihilation. Since you do

not mention your source of infor
mation, I refer you to Dr. Herman
Kahn’s book, “On Thermonuclear
War.”
In this book, one of the theses
is the generally ignored fact that
different types of nuclear war
exist. There is a vast difference
between a war in which 10 million
Americans are killed and one in
which 100 million Americans are
killed. Both are catastrophic, but
the second in far more serious
than the first.
Mr. Kahn also points out that
the enemies’ prime targets are our
retaliatory capabilities, and there
are several reasons why our ma
jor cities might be spared. Final
ly, an adequate civil defense pro
gram tends to act as a deterrent
to enemy attack since it is one
more unknown which they must
weigh in deciding to strike.
I personally have taken steps
and plan to take more to see that
I and my family do not get killed
through my own negativism. I am
not interested in the federal gov
ernment spending vast billions to
build me a shelter. If they will
simply give me the pertinent in
formation, I will try an old fash
ioned idea of looking out for my
self.
I agree whole heartedly with
you that by far the best solution
is peace and hope that we can ob
tain it. However, if it can’t be
achieved I will not give up simply
because your sources tell me I’m
dead.
