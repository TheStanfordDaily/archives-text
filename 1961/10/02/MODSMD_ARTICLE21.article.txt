# New Lost City Group Livens Music Scene

### JUDY SHEAR Associate Editor 
Unlike Berkeley, or even his
torically barren Los Angeles, the
Stanford-Palo Alto area cannot
claim a folk music center, and it
has nothing which resembles a
tradition.
The closest that anyone has
come to establishing roots for folk
music here has been Mary Ann
Pollar, who occasionally brings
artists to the Palo Alto High
School Auditorium for one- or
two-night stands.
But Stanford does not have a
place which could book an artist
for an extended period, which
would be a necessary stop for peo
ple on the circuit from Los An
geles to Berkeley, and which
would be a congregating place
for Stanford’s 500 new guitarists
and folk music fans.
AFTER THE Kingston Trio,
folk music of a sort has been
made a permanent part of the
rock and roll, popular music and
blues vocabulary of the college
student. Most of the time, how
ever, the interest does not go be
yond “La Bamba,” and I am in
clined to think that the reason for
this is simply non-exposure to
anything more genuine. (There is
more interest in good blues be
cause one can hear Ray Charles
without much extraordinary ef
fort.)
When the Palo Alto High School
Auditorium is not entirely full for
a concert of American folk music
by the New Lost City Ramblers
as it was not lor two concerts this
weekend, the lack of interest can
be attributed to a lack of knowl
edge on the part of the Stanford
community.
The group, which is a compara
tively new one, performs what
they call a pre-Bluegrass or an
avant-garde-Rambler-style Blue
grass music, which has the
sound of the old-time string band
and the strong influence of hymn
singing, jazz and Negro blues.
THEY PLAY five instruments
guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin
and autoharp to which they add
three voices. The effect is a con
trapuntal, moving and alive sound
that resembles the old improvised
Dixieland jazz to a large degree.
Mike Seegar (fiddle, mandolin,
autoharp), member of an old folk
family. Tom Palcy (guitar, ban
jo), a Rutgers mathematician, and
John Cohen (guitar, banjo), grad
uate of the Yale School of Fine
Arts, make up the group.
Songs of social significance get
the same deadpan treatment as
those lost in the building of King
Solomon's temple. Spontaneous
folk lore and choreography add to
the casual character of the per
formance, but there is no doubt
that they know their music well:
their kidding is that of a minority
for itself.

Perhaps the most outstanding
offering of Friday evening was a
breakdown called “Crow Black
Chicken.” They performed the
classic “Arkansas Traveller” with
exceptional finesse, and Tom Pa
ley’s “Stackerly” was noteworthy
in its restraint and contrast to
other versions. It was a highly
successful concert.
