# Prothro Blows Up, Colls OSU ’Quitters
## 
### 
Oregon State Coach Tom Proth
ro was burning mad after his
team had just been slaughtered
by an inspired Stanford eleven
34-0. The Beavers were 12-point
favorites and the outcome has to
be one of the major upsets of the
young 1961 season.
“We blew every opportunity we
had. They got ahead and we quit,"
sai Prothro.
“NO," HE REPLIED, “this
wasn’t any letdown from the Syra
cuse game. (The Beavers had
fumbled away the ball game
against the highly ranked Orange
men 19-8 the week before). It’s
the first team I’ve ever had that
quit. This team has not shown

the right to be protected from
the press.
“We have to show more team
effort. They play more like a
group of individuals. Yes, there
will be a lot of changes next week.
Prothro stated that the only
player who did a good job was
Bruce Williams, a reserve full
back.
The Beaver dressing room was
completely quiet and all of the
men seemed thoroughly defeated.
IN ANSWER to the question
whether OSU would revert back
to the single wing formation on
offense, the'tall Prothro snapped
“no comment."

many shots as the varsity, but made them pay off, winning 13-10.
