# Water Polo Alums Top Indian 13-10
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanfordâ€™s varsity water polo
team got off to a shaky start Sat
urday. losing to a fine alumni
team, 13-10. The game was rather
loosely played; fouls were numer
ous, but no one was called out of
the game.
The alumni were led by Jim
Lee, who made six goals and play
ed a fine game. Also a standout
was Jim Gaughran, who scored
four goals. Jim, incidentally, is the
coach of the varsity team. He
played for the alumni to enable
them to field a full team of seven
men.
Scoring for Stanford was fairly
even, with Bob Lorton, Bill Lor
ton, and Bob Spence each netting
two goals.
A big factor in the alumni win
was accuracy. Only 24 shots were
attempted as against 43 for the
varsity.
The alumni came out of the
first quarter leading four to three,
slowing down in the second, scor
ing only two goals to the varsity
one. In the third quarter Stanford
held the alumni to two goals
while scoring a deuce themselves.

The last quarter was a high scor
ing one for both squads as Stan
ford scored four goals to the
alum's five.
