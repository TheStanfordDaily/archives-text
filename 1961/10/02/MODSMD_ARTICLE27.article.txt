# Coach Jack —All Smiles

“Wasn’t that something?”
smiled Jack Curtice on the plane
back to San Francisco.
“I thought they could do it.
You know even before the season
started I said to Don (Don Lieben
dorfer, Stanford’s athletic publi
city director) that we wore going
to have some fun. These kids
really are unselfish and love to
play football. We stayed on the
ground most of the first half to
get the kids over the jitters, but
then you saw how they opened
up.
CURTICE cracked a big grin
as he related his emotions when
Terry Baker swept his own right
end and then reversed his field for
51 yards late in the second quar
ter. “I got down in a defensive
crouch as I saw him coming to
ward the sidelines where we were.
You know when you have played
this game and been around it so
long like 1 have it’s second nature.
I thought that I’d belt him one
good, but just about that time
Old John (center John Butler)
caught up with him. Wasn’t that
a superhuman effort by Butler?”
When asked about the abrupt
turnabout of his team in the sec
ond half Cactus Jack replied, “We
loosened up our tackles a bit in
the second half to stop some of
their wide stuff and those double
reverses. That w-ay our tackles
weren’t getting hooked so fast.
“OUR PASS defense was tre
mendous.”
Cactus rattled on about all sorts
of selected items, not unlike his
baseball counterpart Casey Sten
gel:
“Sears should get a little more
zip into his passes. Actually a
couple of times he had men out
there and floated them a little too
much and gave the defensive men
a chance to come up. Especially
that Rivera he’s a real tough
ballplayer. But we set him up
pretty good. Royse was going out
and then cutting in and then on
the big play he did the same thing
and then cut back out. That play
sort of got the boys going.
“How about Fitzmorris’ run?
The blocking was a coach’s dream
and Tyce zigzagged right through
there.

“OUR BOYS don’t know the
word ‘quit’. A lot of teams would
have folded after that first half
but they dodn’t.”
When queried about next week’s
clash with rugged Michigan State
Coach Curtice replied “The team
will give a good account of itself
back there don’t worry. They are
a good football team and work
together like some of the teams
I’ve had in some of my earlier
years of coaching.
THE CARDS came through the
struggle without any serious in
juries it was learned.
“Be sure to mention Kamikaze.”
The writers asked for the name
again. “Oh, I always call him that.
It’s Ed Cummings. He played with
a broken rib taped up and still
did his fine job. His job is to get
down there first on kickoffs and
hit the guy with the ball.”

couple of times he had men out
there and floated them a little too
much and gave the defensive men
a chance to come up. Especially
that Rivera he’s a real tough
ballplayer. But we set him up
pretty good. Royse was going out
and then cutting in and then on
the big play he did the same thing
and then cut back out. That play
sort of got the boys going.
“How about Fitzmorris’ run?
The blocking was a coach’s dream
and Tyce zigzagged right through
there.

“OUR BOYS don’t know the
word ‘quit’. A lot of teams would
have folded after that first half
but they dodn’t.”
When queried about next week’s
clash with rugged Michigan State
Coach Curtice replied “The team
will give a good account of itself
back there don’t worry. They are
a good football team and work
together like some of the teams
I’ve had in some of my earlier
years of coaching.
THE CARDS came through the
struggle without any serious in
juries it was learned.
“Be sure to mention Kamikaze.”
The writers asked for the name
again. “Oh, I always call him that.
It’s Ed Cummings. He played with
a broken rib taped up and still
did his fine job. His job is to get
down there first on kickoffs and
hit the guy with the ball.”
—Dery
“Wasn’t that something?”
smiled Jack Curtice on the plane
back to San Francisco.
“I thought they could do it.
You know even before the season
started I said to Don (Don Lieben
dorfer, Stanford’s athletic publi
city director) that we wore going
to have some fun. These kids
really are unselfish and love to
play football. We stayed on the
ground most of the first half to
get the kids over the jitters, but
then you saw how they opened
up.
CURTICE cracked a big grin
as he related his emotions when
Terry Baker swept his own right
end and then reversed his field for
51 yards late in the second quar
ter. “I got down in a defensive
crouch as I saw him coming to
ward the sidelines where we were.
You know when you have played
this game and been around it so
long like 1 have it’s second nature.
I thought that I’d belt him one
good, but just about that time
Old John (center John Butler)
caught up with him. Wasn’t that
a superhuman effort by Butler?”
When asked about the abrupt
turnabout of his team in the sec
ond half Cactus Jack replied, “We
loosened up our tackles a bit in
the second half to stop some of
their wide stuff and those double
reverses. That w-ay our tackles
weren’t getting hooked so fast.
“OUR PASS defense was tre
mendous.”
Cactus rattled on about all sorts
of selected items, not unlike his
baseball counterpart Casey Sten
gel:
“Sears should get a little more
zip into his passes. Actually a
couple of times he had men out
