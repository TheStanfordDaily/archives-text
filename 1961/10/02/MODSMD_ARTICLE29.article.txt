##

By United Press International
Roger Maris overcame the pres
sure, of his last chance and tlie
legend of Babe Ruth today when
he rocketed his 61st rome run of
the season to surpass a mark that
defied baseball’s greatest sluggers
for 34 years.
The historic blow a 360-foot
dr ive off r ookie right-hander Tra
cy Stallard came in the fourth
inning of the Yankee’s 1-0 victory
over the Boston Red Sox and
landed close to the spot where the
immortal Ruth irit his 60th on Sep
tember 30, 1927.
A CROWD of 23,154 stood in a
thunderous tribute as the 27-year
old Maris, a native of Hibbing,
Minn., who now resides in Fargo,
N.D., trotted around the bases
with a thin smile on his sharp fea
tures. As he ran, he heaved his
chest in the cool autumn air like
a man who had just thrown a
tremendous weight off his shoul
ders.
And indeed he had for he had
overcome the throat-clutching
pressure of a season-long drive on
the greatest record and the great
est legend in all baseball history.
In his long, lonely ordeal he had
pursued a mark that had come
down through the years as a
monument to the immortal Ruth’s
greatness and a record which mil
lions of baseball fans never ex
pected to see totpped.
On top of it he had finally
“gone over the top” in the Yan
kees’ last game of a 162-game
schedule five days and four
games after he reached Ruth’s
pinnacle with his own No. 60 last
Tuesday night. The record actu
ally is an extension of his own
record for 162 games because
Commissioner Ford Frick has
ruled that Ruth’s peak total will
remain on the books as a separate
mark for a 154-game schedule.
MARIS, WHO HAD flied out to
left field in the first inning, had
two more opportunities to im
prove on his own record. With the
crowd cheering wildly for him to
connect for No. 62, however, he
struck out in the sixth inning and
lifted a routine fly to short right
field in the eighth.
The record shot came off a 2-0
pitch after the crowd had booed
the 24-year-old Stallard for miss
ing the plate with his first two
deliveries. Maris uncoiled on the
third offering and drove the ball
about eight rows deep into the
lower right field seats adjacent
to the Yankees’ bullpen.
There was an immediate scram
ble of fans in that sector for the
prized souvenir which will bring
the recipient $5,000 offered by a
Sacramento, Calif, restaurateur,
who has stipulated that the ball
must be returned to Maris.
OTHER THAN a slight smile
which played across his features,
the 27-year-old Maris showed little
emotion as he trotted around the
bases to the thunderous ovation
of the fans.
A young fan bolted out of the
stands near the Yankee dugout to
congratulate Maris on the field
and the Yankee outfielder pumped
his hands just before trotting into
(he dugout. Maris hesitated on the
top step, then took off his helmet
and waved it to the crowd. He was
reluctant to stand there and re
ceive the approval but teammate
Hector Lopez, in the dugout at the
time, kept pushing him out so that
he could be in full view of all
those who wore cheering him.
Maris received another ovation
as he trotted out to his centerfield
position at the end of the fourth
inning. Jim Honochick, the second
base umpire, stopped him on his
way out and shook his hand.
“WHETHER I HIT one or not,
this would be the happiest day of
my life,” said the weary Maris be
fore the game started. “No one

I has any idea how tired I am. I’ll
he glad when (lie season is over.”
The home run off Stallard was
the first one hit by Maris off the
Red Sox rookie this year. He faced
him only three times previously
this season. Maris popped up
against Stallard on July 8, and
(hen on July 22 when he faced
him again, he lined out to the
first baseman and filed to right
field.
Stallard received a round of ap
plause from the fans when he
came up to bat in the top of the
fifth even though the Red Sox
trailed, 1-0, at the time.

MARIS' (51 home runs will go
into the books as a record for a
162-game season. It will bo a rec
ord apart from the 60 home runs
Ruth hit during a 154-game sea
son in 1927. Ruth hit his 60th
homer on September 30, 1927, off
Tom Zachary of the Washington
Senators.
The home run hy Maris was the
Yankees’ 240 th of the season and
that also constituted a new all
time record. The New York Giants
set the previous record of 221 in
1947 and the Cincinnati Reds
equalled that mark in 1956.
I Manager Ralph Houk kept

Maris in the lineup after his rec
ord breaking homer. On his first
trip to the plate in the opening
frame Maris Hied out to left field
er- Carl Yastrzemski.
THE FAN WHO caught Maris’
Gist home run identified himself
as Sal Durante, a 19-year-old from
Brooklyn. He said that this was
only the second game he had at
tended at Yankee Stadium this
year He added that he planned to
go out to Sacramento, all ex
penses paid, and collect the $5,000,
which has been placed in escrow
in a New York bank, for returning
the ball to Maris.
