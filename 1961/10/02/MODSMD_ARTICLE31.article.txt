# Bears Lose to lowa As AAWU Teams Split
## 
### 
Cal, after stumbling through
the first twenty-six minutes of
play, sparked in the last few min
utes of the second quarter in an
attack led by Fullback George

Pierovich for their sole TD of the
game as they last to the Univer
sity of lowa, the probable number
one team in the nation, by a re
spectable score of 28-7.
A dazzling University of Michi
gan walked over ninth ranked
UCLA, 29-6, with powerful ground
attack led hy Bill Tunnicliff and
Dave Rainey. The Wolverines
were quick to capitalize on UCLA
errors, scoring on two short
UCLA punts, a recovered fumble.

and a 92-yard pass interception,
Huskie quarterback Kermit Jor
genson broke loose for two touch
down drives of 54 and 72 yards,
and halfback Charlie Mitchell ran
66 yards as Washington upset the
University of Illinois, 20-7.

A first quarter 93-yard run
down the sidelines by USC half
back, Willie Brown, spurred the
Trojans to victory over Southern
Methodist Friday, as the USC
eleven won their first game after
losing their opener last week.
