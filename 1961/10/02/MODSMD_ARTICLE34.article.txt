# Gaieties Girl Needs a Man
## 
### 
Gaieties tryouts will be held
tomorrow, Wednesday and
Thursday in the rear hall of
Mem Aud. at 7:30 p.m.
Barbara Greer, choreog
rapher, says that the staff is
specifically interested in men.
“I believe such creatures ex
ist at Stanford, although I’ve
yet to see one,” she says. “But
the prospective Gaieties audi
ence will be sorely disap
pointed if there are no men in
the show.
“Women are needed too, of
course, but I am not so un
certain of their existence,”
she continued.
