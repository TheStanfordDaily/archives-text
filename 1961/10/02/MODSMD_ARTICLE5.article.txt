CACTUS JACK WELCOMED BACK BY CROWD
A happy Coach Jack Curtice stood on a car in front of the Men's Gym
Saturday night and thanked a crowd of about 500 students who
took part in a hastily-organized pep rally. Crowd waited for more
than an hour before Curtice, (who walked almost unnoticed through
the crowd) and the team showed up at 9:20 from the airport. Almost
1,000 students, pom-pon girls and band members greeted the Cards
at the airport—and caused some confusion before they were ushered
outside so the passengers in the terminal could hear the announce
ments of arriving and departing flights.
