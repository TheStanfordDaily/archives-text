## 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
What is happening in the
Peace Corps? How can people
get chosen for the Corps, how
are they trained and what do
they do?
A trio of top Peace Corps ex
ecutives answered questions such
as these during a Bay Area meet
ing at the Sheraton-Palace last
Friday and Saturday, as part of
a nation-wide tour to inform the
public about the newly-formed
Corps.
FOURTEEN Stanford students
attended the conference including

Lucy Ames, Bill Dedman, Fran
ces Fisher, Rosemary George,
Irene Gorman, Ginger Hale, Allen
Howe, David Korten, Don Light,
Bill Luring, Ann Mauney, Joel
Meister, Dean Savage, and Nancy
Sherwood.
Robert Rehder of the Office of
the President served as a host
for the conference and Peter
Grothe, Peace Corps representa
tive and political science gradu
ate student at Stanford, spoke
briefly about applying for the
Corps.
Now serving abroad in the rap
idly growing Peace Corps are 450
men and women, reported Frank
lin Williams, Special Assistant to
Sargent Shriver, Peace Corps Di
rector. Williams stated that the
Corps will grow to 1,000 by
Christmas, to 2,500 by June and
to 5,000 by the end of the sum
mer.
THE 150 members are serving
on varied projects in 10 countries
including Chile, Colombia, Santa
Lucia, East Pakistan, India, Ma
laya, the Philippines, Ghana, Tan
ganyika and Nigeria.
In his Saturday noon speech
Warren Wiggins, Associate Direc
tor for Program Development
and Operations, described the at
titude change toward the Peace
Corps on the part of underdevel
oped countries since its begin
ning.
“An instrument of subversion
. . . an agency of imperial aspira
tions” t he Ghana Times labelled
the Peace Corps movement when
Shriver first visited Ghana. How
ever, “there soon grew a foreign
delight with the movement, a
realization that Americans would
work along side rather than
above the other guy,” Wiggins
said.
LATER. WHEN a group of
Peace Corps members landed in
Ghana singing the national an
them in the native dialect, one
chief greeted them saying “Oh
you’re the Peace Corps, the
people coming to learn as well as
teach, the white man with humil
ity. You are quite welcome.”
David Apter, Political Science
professor at Cal and director of
the training center for the mem
bers who went to Ghana, de
scribed (he type of training the
members received.
BEING director of one of, the
first training centers, Apter re
marked "Frankly I was nervous
about the kind of people who
would turn out for this kind of
program. Fortunately I was re
markably surprised at the quality
of the students.”

The training for the Ghana
group included intensive study of
the native dialect of Ghana, the
history of Ghana and Africa from
an African point of view, health
training, and background mate
rial on the United States so that
students could answer such ques
tions as “Why is there poverty
in the U.S.?” or “How does your
political party system work?”
THOUGH having received ques
tionnaires from 15,000 volunteers
and having administered 7,000 ex
aminations, the Corps is search
ing the country for more quali
fied people.
“The Peace Corps is looking
for volunteers who care for
people,” staled Wiggins.
MANY OTHER qualifications
are needed by candidates for se
lection. Intelligence, emotional
stability, language aptitude, good
health, and general knowledge
are basic requirements for mem
bers.

“The Peace Corps is not a
Youth Corps,” Williams stated,
stressing that “over 18” was the
only age limit on members,
though the average age of mem
bers is 25, and 64 per cent are
between 22 and 25. Married
couples are acceptable, “in fact,
we like them especially because
they provide moral support for
one another in. conditions of hard
ship,” Williams commented. If a
married person applies, his
spouse must also apply.
“Pay for Peace Corps members
varies with the country where he
is assigned,” Wiggins explained.
Each member is given a monthly
allotment sufficient to maintain
a living standard at the level of
his fellow native workers. "In the
Philippines, for instance, this
would be $lOO while in Africa it
might be $250.” In all cases $75
per month is set aside to be given
the member upon his return to
the States,
DURING the two-year service
period a member is assigned to a
specific project for which he has
a special aptitude. Secondary
school teachers, skilled laborers,
surveyors, agriculturists, nurses,
and engineers are among the jobs
especially in demand.
For the liberal arts college
graduates without specific skills,
Wiggins pointed out the oppor
tunity for service as English
teachers, since the need is great
est for people who simply speak
English well, and those without
specific training as English teach
ers tend to be more flexible. Lib
eral Arts graduates are also use
ful in community development
projects.
Grothe urged interested per-

sons to take the first step in
applying by sending in the Peace
Corps Volunteer Questionnaire.
Information concerning these
forms may be obtained at tile HR
Shack. Other steps involved in

entering the Corps include;
• WRITTEN examination to
be given on October 7, Nov. 30
1 and Dec. 1. Grot he suggested ap
plicants should take the lest as
i early as possible. The main test

for this area is on Nov. 30.
• Personal interview by Peace
Corps board.
• Observation and investiga
tion of candidate.
• Two- to six-month training

session given at a university and
designed especially for the proj
ect to be undertaken.
• Review by representative
from country where Peace Corps
member is to be sent.

you’re the Peace Corps, the

David Apter, Political Science
professor at Cal and director of
the training center for the mem

BEING director of one of, the
first training centers, Apter re
marked "Frankly I was nervous
about the kind of people who
would turn out for this kind of
program. Fortunately I was re
markably surprised at the quality
of the students.”

The training for the Ghana
group included intensive study of
the native dialect of Ghana, the
history of Ghana and Africa from
an African point of view, health
training, and background mate
rial on the United States so that
students could answer such ques

in the U.S.?” or “How does your
political party system work?”
THOUGH having received ques

and having administered 7,000 ex
aminations, the Corps is search

“The Peace Corps is looking

people,” staled Wiggins.
MANY OTHER qualifications
are needed by candidates for se

stability, language aptitude, good

“The Peace Corps is not a
Youth Corps,” Williams stated,
stressing that “over 18” was the
only age limit on members,
though the average age of mem
bers is 25, and 64 per cent are
between 22 and 25. Married
couples are acceptable, “in fact,
we like them especially because
they provide moral support for

married person applies, his

Each member is given a monthly
allotment sufficient to maintain
a living standard at the level of
his fellow native workers. "In the
Philippines, for instance, this
would be $lOO while in Africa it
might be $250.” In all cases $75
per month is set aside to be given
the member upon his return to
the States,
DURING the two-year service
period a member is assigned to a
specific project for which he has
a special aptitude. Secondary
school teachers, skilled laborers,
surveyors, agriculturists, nurses,
and engineers are among the jobs
especially in demand.
For the liberal arts college
graduates without specific skills,
Wiggins pointed out the oppor

English well, and those without
specific training as English teach

only age limit on members,
though the average age of mem
bers is 25, and 64 per cent are
between 22 and 25. Married
couples are acceptable, “in fact,
we like them especially because
they provide moral support for
one another in. conditions of hard
ship,” Williams commented. If a
married person applies, his
spouse must also apply.
“Pay for Peace Corps members
varies with the country where he
is assigned,” Wiggins explained.
Each member is given a monthly
allotment sufficient to maintain
a living standard at the level of
his fellow native workers. "In the
Philippines, for instance, this
would be $lOO while in Africa it
might be $250.” In all cases $75
per month is set aside to be given
the member upon his return to
the States,
DURING the two-year service
period a member is assigned to a
specific project for which he has
a special aptitude. Secondary
school teachers, skilled laborers,
surveyors, agriculturists, nurses,
and engineers are among the jobs
especially in demand.
For the liberal arts college
graduates without specific skills,
Wiggins pointed out the oppor
tunity for service as English
teachers, since the need is great
est for people who simply speak
English well, and those without
specific training as English teach
ers tend to be more flexible. Lib
eral Arts graduates are also use
ful in community development
projects.
Grothe urged interested per-

sons to take the first step in
applying by sending in the Peace
Corps Volunteer Questionnaire.

entering the Corps include;
• WRITTEN examination to
be given on October 7, Nov. 30

for this area is on Nov. 30.
• Personal interview by Peace

What is happening in the
Peace Corps? How can people
get chosen for the Corps, how
are they trained and what do
they do?
A trio of top Peace Corps ex

as these during a Bay Area meet
ing at the Sheraton-Palace last
Friday and Saturday, as part of
a nation-wide tour to inform the
public about the newly-formed
Corps.
FOURTEEN Stanford students
attended the conference including

Lucy Ames, Bill Dedman, Fran
ces Fisher, Rosemary George,
Irene Gorman, Ginger Hale, Allen
Howe, David Korten, Don Light,
Bill Luring, Ann Mauney, Joel
Meister, Dean Savage, and Nancy
Sherwood.
Robert Rehder of the Office of
the President served as a host

Grothe, Peace Corps representa

briefly about applying for the
Corps.
Now serving abroad in the rap
idly growing Peace Corps are 450
men and women, reported Frank
lin Williams, Special Assistant to
Sargent Shriver, Peace Corps Di
rector. Williams stated that the
Corps will grow to 1,000 by
Christmas, to 2,500 by June and
to 5,000 by the end of the sum

THE 150 members are serving
on varied projects in 10 countries
including Chile, Colombia, Santa
Lucia, East Pakistan, India, Ma
laya, the Philippines, Ghana, Tan
ganyika and Nigeria.
In his Saturday noon speech
Warren Wiggins, Associate Direc
tor for Program Development
and Operations, described the at
titude change toward the Peace
Corps on the part of underdevel
oped countries since its begin
ning.
“An instrument of subversion
. . . an agency of imperial aspira
tions” t he Ghana Times labelled
the Peace Corps movement when
Shriver first visited Ghana. How
ever, “there soon grew a foreign
delight with the movement, a
realization that Americans would
work along side rather than
above the other guy,” Wiggins
said.
LATER. WHEN a group of
Peace Corps members landed in
Ghana singing the national an
them in the native dialect, one
chief greeted them saying “Oh
you’re the Peace Corps, the
people coming to learn as well as
teach, the white man with humil
ity. You are quite welcome.”
David Apter, Political Science
professor at Cal and director of
the training center for the mem
bers who went to Ghana, de
scribed (he type of training the
members received.
BEING director of one of, the
first training centers, Apter re
marked "Frankly I was nervous
about the kind of people who
would turn out for this kind of
program. Fortunately I was re
markably surprised at the quality
of the students.”

The training for the Ghana
group included intensive study of
the native dialect of Ghana, the
history of Ghana and Africa from
an African point of view, health
training, and background mate
rial on the United States so that
students could answer such ques

in the U.S.?” or “How does your
political party system work?”
THOUGH having received ques
tionnaires from 15,000 volunteers
and having administered 7,000 ex
aminations, the Corps is search

fied people.
“The Peace Corps is looking
for volunteers who care for
people,” staled Wiggins.
MANY OTHER qualifications
are needed by candidates for se

stability, language aptitude, good
health, and general knowledge
are basic requirements for mem

What is happening in the
Peace Corps? How can people
get chosen for the Corps, how
are they trained and what do
they do?
A trio of top Peace Corps ex
ecutives answered questions such
as these during a Bay Area meet
ing at the Sheraton-Palace last
Friday and Saturday, as part of
a nation-wide tour to inform the
public about the newly-formed
Corps.
FOURTEEN Stanford students
attended the conference including

Lucy Ames, Bill Dedman, Fran
ces Fisher, Rosemary George,
Irene Gorman, Ginger Hale, Allen
Howe, David Korten, Don Light,
Bill Luring, Ann Mauney, Joel
Meister, Dean Savage, and Nancy
Sherwood.
Robert Rehder of the Office of
the President served as a host
for the conference and Peter
Grothe, Peace Corps representa
tive and political science gradu
ate student at Stanford, spoke
briefly about applying for the
Corps.
Now serving abroad in the rap
idly growing Peace Corps are 450
men and women, reported Frank
lin Williams, Special Assistant to
Sargent Shriver, Peace Corps Di
rector. Williams stated that the
Corps will grow to 1,000 by
Christmas, to 2,500 by June and
to 5,000 by the end of the sum
mer.
THE 150 members are serving
on varied projects in 10 countries
including Chile, Colombia, Santa
Lucia, East Pakistan, India, Ma
laya, the Philippines, Ghana, Tan
ganyika and Nigeria.
In his Saturday noon speech
Warren Wiggins, Associate Direc
tor for Program Development
and Operations, described the at
titude change toward the Peace
Corps on the part of underdevel
oped countries since its begin
ning.
“An instrument of subversion
. . . an agency of imperial aspira
tions” t he Ghana Times labelled
the Peace Corps movement when
Shriver first visited Ghana. How
ever, “there soon grew a foreign
delight with the movement, a
realization that Americans would
work along side rather than
above the other guy,” Wiggins
said.
LATER. WHEN a group of
Peace Corps members landed in
Ghana singing the national an
them in the native dialect, one
chief greeted them saying “Oh
you’re the Peace Corps, the
people coming to learn as well as
teach, the white man with humil
ity. You are quite welcome.”
David Apter, Political Science
professor at Cal and director of
the training center for the mem
bers who went to Ghana, de
scribed (he type of training the
members received.
BEING director of one of, the
first training centers, Apter re
marked "Frankly I was nervous
about the kind of people who
would turn out for this kind of
program. Fortunately I was re
markably surprised at the quality
of the students.”

The training for the Ghana
group included intensive study of
the native dialect of Ghana, the
history of Ghana and Africa from
an African point of view, health
training, and background mate
rial on the United States so that
students could answer such ques
tions as “Why is there poverty
in the U.S.?” or “How does your
political party system work?”
THOUGH having received ques
tionnaires from 15,000 volunteers
and having administered 7,000 ex
aminations, the Corps is search
ing the country for more quali
fied people.
“The Peace Corps is looking
for volunteers who care for
people,” staled Wiggins.
MANY OTHER qualifications
are needed by candidates for se
lection. Intelligence, emotional
stability, language aptitude, good
health, and general knowledge
are basic requirements for mem
bers.

“The Peace Corps is not a
Youth Corps,” Williams stated,
stressing that “over 18” was the
only age limit on members,
though the average age of mem
bers is 25, and 64 per cent are
between 22 and 25. Married
couples are acceptable, “in fact,
we like them especially because
they provide moral support for
one another in. conditions of hard
ship,” Williams commented. If a
married person applies, his
spouse must also apply.
“Pay for Peace Corps members
varies with the country where he
is assigned,” Wiggins explained.
Each member is given a monthly
allotment sufficient to maintain
a living standard at the level of
his fellow native workers. "In the
Philippines, for instance, this
would be $lOO while in Africa it
might be $250.” In all cases $75
per month is set aside to be given
the member upon his return to
the States,
DURING the two-year service
period a member is assigned to a
specific project for which he has
a special aptitude. Secondary
school teachers, skilled laborers,
surveyors, agriculturists, nurses,
and engineers are among the jobs
especially in demand.
For the liberal arts college
graduates without specific skills,
Wiggins pointed out the oppor
tunity for service as English
teachers, since the need is great
est for people who simply speak
English well, and those without
specific training as English teach
ers tend to be more flexible. Lib
eral Arts graduates are also use
ful in community development
projects.
Grothe urged interested per-

sons to take the first step in
applying by sending in the Peace
Corps Volunteer Questionnaire.
Information concerning these
forms may be obtained at tile HR
Shack. Other steps involved in

entering the Corps include;
• WRITTEN examination to
be given on October 7, Nov. 30
1 and Dec. 1. Grot he suggested ap
plicants should take the lest as
i early as possible. The main test

for this area is on Nov. 30.
• Personal interview by Peace
Corps board.
• Observation and investiga
tion of candidate.
• Two- to six-month training

session given at a university and
designed especially for the proj
ect to be undertaken.
• Review by representative
from country where Peace Corps
member is to be sent.
