# Nasser’s Republic Subdivided; Syrians Now Independent
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon (UPl)—Syria
formally proclaimed its independ
ence from Cairo for the first time
yesterday while the military
cracked down hard on opposition
within Syria itself. Cairo Radio
said a “revolution'’ had broken
out in the northern Syrian city of
Aleppo.
The Syrian revolutionary gov
ernment abruptly sealed its bor
ders again today, closed schools
and universities, threatened to ar
rest and deport non-Syrian demon
strators and ordered all Syrians
to surrender their firearms to the
nearest police station.
DAMASCUS Radio said the
Syrian army had taken over pub
lic security and yas in control.
Cairo, however, put forth a flood
of reports of disorders, fighting
and demonstrations broken up by
tanks and armored cars. One stu
dent demonstration was quelled
with machineguns only yesterday,
Cairo said.
In Cairo, the United Arab Re
public announced its decision to
break off diplomatic relations
with Turkey and Jordan because
of their recognition of the Syrian
rebel regime. They were the first
nations to recognize the new gov
ernment.
A bomb believed thrown by pro-
Nasser demonstrators exploded in
the garden of Turkish Ambassa
dor Semsetting Arif Mardin here,
but no one was hurt.
JORDAN’S KING Hussein said
in Amman that the Syrian revolt
was a “blessed upsurge” for free
dom. He implied that Cairo’s idea
of Arab unity was “based on hor
ror, fear and surrender.”
A German businessman return
ing to Beirut from Damascus said
demonstrations for and against
Nasser were staged there through
out the day, but there was no vi
olence.
Israel, caught in the middle be
tween Syria and Egypt, was
watching the situation carefully.
Israeli government officials fear
ed some Syrian action against
Israel to win new Arab support
for the Damascus rebel regime.
SYRIA appeared to be cracking
down with an iron fist against the
threats to the three-day-old gov
commander, closed schools, im-

posed curfews and threatened to
arrest and report non-Syrian dem
ernment. It named a new army
onstrators.
Only a handful of Syrians with
special permission from Damas
cus were allowed to enter the
country. Syrian border guards
turned back all other travelers in
cluding newsmen, an American
man with a diplomatic passport
and the Egyptian head of the Da
mascus College of Fine Arts.
Observers here said the border
closing appeared to confirm scat
tered reports of disturbances al
though there was no confirmation
of Cairo reports that fighting had
broken out at Aleppo and that the
rebel garrison there had radioed
an appeal for help.
BAGHDAD dispatches mean
while clarified reports that' Iraqi
Premier Abdul Karim Kassem had
dispatched troops to the Syrian
frontier. The dispatches said he
had only “alerted units of the
army in case of foreign interfer
ence in the country of our broth
ers.”
Reports from Cairo gave a more
alarming account of the situa
tion in Syria than did broadcasts
by Damascus Radio. The semi-of
ficiail Middle East News Agency

said in Cairo there were “violent
clashes” in Syria between demon
strators and the army at start of
the revolt Thursday.
Another Cairo report said two
of the leaders of the coup in Syria
had been “assassinated” but there
were no other details.
Though there was a possibility
the Cairo reports were exagger
ated the border closing left little
doubt there were some sort of dis
orders in Syria. At one point an
armored car and several soldiers
were summoned to back up a
Syrian officers’ demand that
would-be travelers return to their
cars.
