CONTROL SYSTEMS:!
ORDERS FROM A COMPUTER/
NOW CONTROL (
GIANT OIL REFINERY UNIT]
Every 24 hours, the world’s largest distillation unit separates
crude oil into ten different categories which end up as six
million gallons of finished products.
This involves continual monitoring of 250 instruments, fol
lowed by precise balancing of controls. To operate at peak
efficiency, control directions are changed many times daily
to compensate for a multitude of variables.
The IBM computer that took over this job now reads the
instruments, makes the calculations, and issues the orders
for the control changes. It is guided in its work by over
75,000 instructions stored in its electronic memory.
Just a few years ago electronic control of such a complex
industrial process would have been impossible. But such is
the progress in computer systems that in the sixties it will
become commonplace.
This dramatic progress means exciting and important jobs
at IBM for the college graduate, whether in research, de
velopment, manufacturing, or programming.
If you want to find out about opportunities in any one of these
areas, you are invited to talk with the IBM representative. He
