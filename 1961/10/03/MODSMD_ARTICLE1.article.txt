LOS ANGELES—( UPI )—Banker J. Howard Edgerton said yes
terday he “would be surprised” if Goodwin J. Knight did not iden
tify him as an emissary of Richard M. Nixon who purportedly
offered a deal if Knight stayed out of the 1962 Governor’s race.
“T1 le only statement 1 II make at this time,” said Edgerton, “is

that I have never been an emis
sary of Dick Nixon on any matter
in my entire life.”
EDGERTON, a former Knight
Financial Chairman, is President
of the California Federal Savings
and Loan Association and the 6th
District Agricultural Association.
He has long been active in behalf
of the Republican Party.
Knight said last week an emis
sary of Nixon telephoned him
Sept. 7 to offer “any state job up
to Chief Justice” to stay out of
the running in 1962. Nixon flatly
denied the claim.
Knighl now has scheduled an
11 a.m. press conference at his of
fice tomorrow to disclose identity
of the “emissary.”
Asked by reporters if Knight
would name him as the emissary,
Edgerton replied:
“I would be surprised if he
didn't.”
Also asked if he had telephoned
Knight Sept. 7, Edgerton said. “If
I answered one question, it leads
to another.”
HE SAID he would not com
ment further until Knight makes
his announcement.
Nixon not only flatly denied
any deals, but called Knight’s
charges false and libelous. Ho said
he never authorized anyone to ap
proach Knight, and repeated his
denial Sunday night. “Why would
I be sending emissaries to Mr.
Knight when I myself had not
made a final decision on my can
didacy until just the night before
I made my announcement,” said
Nixon.
Paul Mason, one-time Director
of Motor Vehicles, said he was
present when Knight received the
telephone call to which he refer
red. He said he would “leave it to
the Governor to say who the caller
was.”
KNIGHT HAS confirmed Mason
was one of the witnesses who
heard the telephone call. He said
there were “four or five people in
my room and now it’s a matter of
contacting them and seeing when
they’re available.”
Governor Edmund G. Brown, in
his press conference yesterday,
said he was “too busy with duties
as Governor to begin a possible
campaign early because of the Re
publican clash.”
