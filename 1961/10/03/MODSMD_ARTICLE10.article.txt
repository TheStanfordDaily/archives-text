# TUESDAY SERIES
## Geochemist To Discuss Russia Trip 
### 
Russian scientists think they
are far freer economically and po
litically than their American coun
terparts, a Stanford scientist who
visited Russia earlier this year has
found.
Konrad B. Krauskopf, associate
dean of the School of Mineral Sci
ences and professor of geochem
istry, will discuss the Russians’
attitudes and other facets of his
visit at tonight’s opening lecture
of the Tuesday evening Series.
HIS LECTURE, titled, “Politi
cal Conversations with Russian
Scientists,” will be presented at
7:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um.
Russian scientists believe they
have freedom of opportunity,
freedom from political arrest,
freedom from fear of economic
insecurity, freedom of speech, and
freedom to choose candidates for
public office, Dr. Krauskopf
found.
“The confusion is in large part
from a difference in the kinds of
freedom which seem particularly
important on the two sides of the
Iron Curtain,” he reported in an
article on his trip in the magazine
“Science.”
DR. KRAUSKOPF is a member
of the magazine’s editorial board
and of the National Academy of
Sciences. He spent a sabbatical
leave at the University of Gottin
gen, Germany, and the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology be
fore returning to the campus.
Dr. Krauskopf has been a fac
ulty member since 1935. He was
educated at the University of Wis
consin and holds two doctorates
one from the University of
California in Chemistry and the
other from Stanford in geology.
