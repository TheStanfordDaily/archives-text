## A 						Task for 'Giants' 
### 
Ever since Vienna in June the
President has been greatly con
cerned with a central question.
How can he convince Mr. Khrush
chev that rather than surrender
the freedom of West Berlin, the
United States would go to war,
and if necessary to nuclear war?
He has said this again and again.
His brother has said it. It has been
said for him.
Yet now. nearly four months
later, after the military build-up
and all that, there is still great
doubt in Washington whether the
American will to fight a nuclear
war has been realized in the
Kremlin.
Why? The simple-minded an
swer, which many believe, is that
Khrushchev, having met the Presi
dent, having studied the big words
about Laos and the fiasco in Cuba,
has concluded that the Kennedy
administration is spineless and
can be intimidated into surren
dering.
THIS READING of Mr. Khrush
chev’s mind is, I feel sure, quite
false. But it is engendering a poi
sonous delusion that American
courage is impugned. As the de
lusion spreads, it is doing pro
found damage to our own nerves,
to our capacity to work our way
through this enormous interna
tional crisis with clear heads and
steady hearts.
There is some danger of a fatal
misunderstanding on Khrush
chev’s part. But it does not lie in
anything so simple and absurd as
the notion that the Russians be
lieve the Americans are cowards.
Does anyone suppose that Khrush
chev supposes that if he attacked
West Berlin as the Japanese at
tacked Pearl Harbor, this country
would surrender?
Not for a moment. The danger
lies in the possibility that he
might misjudge what he could do
short of anything so obvious as
the Japanese attack on Pearl Har
bor or, let us say, Hitler’s invasion
of Poland.
KHRUSHCHEV’S confidence
that there will not be a war over
Berlin rests on the fact that he
has the', initiative, that he can de
termine how much pressure he
will exert on the West. He can go
far, as he did on Aug. 13. But he
cannot go so far as to do a Pearl
Harbor. The danger to the peace
of the world lies in this twilight
zone between intolerable provoca
tion which would lead to war and
harassment that would not be
worth a war.
This twilight zone exists be
cause the Allied position has not
yet been developed fully and de
fined precisely in a really serious
and exhaustive diplomatic confer
ence. In view of the illusions and
miseducation of the past ten years
about the German situation, I do
not believe that the Allied position
can now be developed and defined
in public speeches. If there is to
be a conference, the chief negoti
ator for the West must have
enough freedom so that he is not
immobilized in a straitjacket.
Mr. Gromyko’s speech which
followed the President’s, brought
into the open, although not in pre
cise language, the immediate issue
over West Berlin.
IN ESSENCE, Mr. Gromyko
said that the Soviet Union would
guarantee self-determination in
West Berlin and access to it on
condition that the rights of access
are negotiated first with the East
German government. Whether
this is an intolerable demand or
one that touches no vital interest
of the West cannot be determined
in the abstract. It cannot be deter
mined until it has been thoroughly
explored through diplomatic chan
nels.
Thus, it would obviously be in
tolerable if what Mr. Gromyko
means is that Secretary Rusk is
supposed to go to East Berlin and
work out traffic arrangements

with Herr Ulbricht. But it would
not be intolerable if Mr. Gromyko
meant only that, let us say, dur
ing the coming conference of the
Big Four, there should be a meet
ing of Western, West German,
and East German transportation
specialists to draft an agreement
which all the powers could then
guarantee.
I do not wish to imply that the
task of untangling the knot is
easier than it it. It is extremely
difficult, and the task of creating
a new status and a new function
for West Berlin is one not for the
pygmies, but for the giants.
