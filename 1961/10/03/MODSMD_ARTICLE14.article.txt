Editor, The Daily:
I am afraid Mr. Dan Cullen mis
takes my purpose and misinter
prets my meaning in my letter
. . . attacking Ross Hermann’s
column of Sept. 27.
Mr. Cullen quotes me as saying
that the figures used by Mr. Her
mann, “ ‘in so far as they mean
anything (at all), indicate that the
more education one receives in the
United States, the more likely he
is to favor Kennedy over Nixon.’ ”
lThe “at all” is inserted because I
was misquoted.)
He continues, “The implication
here is that the liberal ideology is
the only one that truly thoughtful
and intelligent men can hold.”
That is not the implication. The
implication here is that the liberal
ideology is more likely (possibly
only slightly more likely) to be
held by a man after he has become
educated than before.
This implication does not deny
an abundance of well-educated
conservatives or that “almost all
(philosophies) can gain support
from scholarship.” It asserts (1)
that political philosophies gain
support from scholarship unequal
ly. to which everyone must agree
who does not believe that Com
munism, fascism, and democracy
gain equally from scholarship,
and (2) that a philosophy disposed
toward Kennedy gains more than
a philosophy disposed toward
Nixon. Nothing either Mr. Her
mann or Mr. Cullen has said of
fers any indication to the con
trary.
I was not trying to assert the
truth of the proposition (2); that
would require at least a full
length article, I do happen to be
sympathetic to it, but I was sim
ply crusading against uncritical
thinking and poor logic.
Mr. Hermann has cited some
statistics to substantiate his case.
As I have indicated before, I do
not think these statistics have
much significance, but if Mr. Her
mann is going to use them, he
must draw the right conclusions
from them.
The statistic in question is that
graduate students at Stanford
voted 178 to 138 for Kennedy,
while the national vote was close
to 50 per cent and Stanford fresh
men voted overwhelmingly for
Nixon. But graduate students here
have been educated in colleges all
over the nation. Therefore, though
other conclusions are possible, the
most logical conclusion is that
higher education in the U.S.
makes one more likely to favor
Kennedy over Nixon.

here is that the liberal ideology is
the only one that truly thoughtful
and intelligent men can hold.”
That is not the implication. The
implication here is that the liberal
ideology is more likely (possibly
only slightly more likely) to be
held by a man after he has become
educated than before.
This implication does not deny
an abundance of well-educated
conservatives or that “almost all
(philosophies) can gain support
from scholarship.” It asserts (1)
that political philosophies gain
support from scholarship unequal
ly. to which everyone must agree
who does not believe that Com
munism, fascism, and democracy
gain equally from scholarship,
and (2) that a philosophy disposed
toward Kennedy gains more than
a philosophy disposed toward
Nixon. Nothing either Mr. Her
mann or Mr. Cullen has said of
fers any indication to the con
trary.
I was not trying to assert the
truth of the proposition (2); that
would require at least a full
length article, I do happen to be
sympathetic to it, but I was sim
ply crusading against uncritical
thinking and poor logic.
Mr. Hermann has cited some
statistics to substantiate his case.
As I have indicated before, I do
not think these statistics have
much significance, but if Mr. Her
mann is going to use them, he
must draw the right conclusions
from them.
The statistic in question is that
graduate students at Stanford
voted 178 to 138 for Kennedy,
while the national vote was close
to 50 per cent and Stanford fresh
men voted overwhelmingly for
Nixon. But graduate students here
have been educated in colleges all
over the nation. Therefore, though
other conclusions are possible, the
most logical conclusion is that
higher education in the U.S.
makes one more likely to favor
Kennedy over Nixon.

I am afraid Mr. Dan Cullen mis
takes my purpose and misinter
prets my meaning in my letter
. . . attacking Ross Hermann’s
column of Sept. 27.
Mr. Cullen quotes me as saying
that the figures used by Mr. Her
mann, “ ‘in so far as they mean
anything (at all), indicate that the
more education one receives in the
United States, the more likely he
is to favor Kennedy over Nixon.’ ”
lThe “at all” is inserted because I
was misquoted.)
