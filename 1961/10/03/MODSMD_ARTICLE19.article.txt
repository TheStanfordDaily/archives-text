Editor, The Daily:
Wilh respect to William C.
Ridgway’s recent letter to The
Daily, there is a far more opti
mistic source of encouragement
on national nuclear casualty than
Dr. Herman Kahn. I refer to Life
magazine. According to Life, only
three per cent of our population
need be incinerated. Mr. Ridgway
is indeed correct that “different
types of nuclear war exist.” The
Holifield committee hearings
showed three per cent dead as the
result of “a very small attack de
livering 300 megatons.” The same
study indicated that a 3,000 mega
ton attack on cities would put In
escapable deaths up to 80 per cent.
According to Mr. Ridgway,
Mr. Kahn also pointed out the
enemies’ prime targets would be
our increasingly hardening re
taliatory capabilities and not our
cities.
But Theodore Roszak has re
cently made this pertinent com
ment in the Nation: "Suppose for
the moment a force of invulner
able missiles could be built. If the
Russians followed suit in this . . .
then, pi-esumably, these missiles
would be aimed at the only acces
sible targets left: population cen
ters. East and West would have
bought their security by overtly
placing their civilian populations
in hostage. To say the least, it is a

weird conception of 'security’
that leads a society to shelter its
weapons like rare treasures and
expose its children to incinera
tion.”
Civil defense is no longer a
stabilizing defensive tactic, but an
offensive weapon, designed to
tranquilize public apprehension to
an unprecedented form of world
war.
Referring to Life’s article, I. F.
Stone remarked that “suddenly
thermonuclear war is made to
seem familiar, almost cozy.”
In these critical times, he said,
“it is dangerous to spread the il
lusion that thermonuclear war
may be away out, a cleansing
thunder storm in the planet’s hu
mid summer ... if only we are
ready to spend a cramped week or
two in underground shelters.”

Holifield committee hearings
showed three per cent dead as the
result of “a very small attack de
livering 300 megatons.” The same
study indicated that a 3,000 mega
ton attack on cities would put In
escapable deaths up to 80 per cent.
According to Mr. Ridgway,
Mr. Kahn also pointed out the
enemies’ prime targets would be
our increasingly hardening re
taliatory capabilities and not our
cities.
But Theodore Roszak has re
cently made this pertinent com
ment in the Nation: "Suppose for
the moment a force of invulner
able missiles could be built. If the
Russians followed suit in this . . .
then, pi-esumably, these missiles
would be aimed at the only acces
sible targets left: population cen
ters. East and West would have
bought their security by overtly
placing their civilian populations
in hostage. To say the least, it is a

weird conception of 'security’
that leads a society to shelter its
weapons like rare treasures and
expose its children to incinera
tion.”
Civil defense is no longer a
stabilizing defensive tactic, but an
offensive weapon, designed to
tranquilize public apprehension to
an unprecedented form of world
war.
Referring to Life’s article, I. F.

thermonuclear war is made to
seem familiar, almost cozy.”
In these critical times, he said,
“it is dangerous to spread the il

may be away out, a cleansing
thunder storm in the planet’s hu

Editor, The Daily:
Wilh respect to William C.
Ridgway’s recent letter to The
Daily, there is a far more opti
mistic source of encouragement
on national nuclear casualty than
Dr. Herman Kahn. I refer to Life
magazine. According to Life, only
three per cent of our population
need be incinerated. Mr. Ridgway
is indeed correct that “different
types of nuclear war exist.” The
Holifield committee hearings
showed three per cent dead as the
result of “a very small attack de
livering 300 megatons.” The same
study indicated that a 3,000 mega
ton attack on cities would put In
escapable deaths up to 80 per cent.
According to Mr. Ridgway,
Mr. Kahn also pointed out the
enemies’ prime targets would be
our increasingly hardening re
taliatory capabilities and not our
