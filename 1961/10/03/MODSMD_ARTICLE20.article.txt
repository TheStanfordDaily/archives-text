# HONORE TOP LINEMAN
## Curtice Tabs Team 'NOW BOYS' 
### 
Cactus Jack Curtice has tabbed
his surprising sophomore-studded
ball club the NOW BOYS in the
tradition of the VOW and WOW
boys of previous years.
Curtice, speaking at the weekly
football writers luncheon in San
Francisco, came up with the name
while reviewing the Indians’ 340
upset win over Oregon State last
weekend. “Those kids are really
working together and are getting
things done now,” he said.
The weekend victory was the
second in a row for Stanford and
their first shutout since 1955.
George Honore, Card end, was
named lineman of the week by
both the Northern California
sportswriters and the Big Five,
the second such honor for a Stan
ford lineman in two weeks. Hon
ore caught seven passes and
played an outstanding game on
defense, turning in the Oregon end
sweeps, and making several key
tackles.
Dick Valois of San Francisco
State was given the top back
award after sparking the Gators
to their third straight win, a 26-19
job over Cal Poly.
Cactus Jack, bubbling with en
thusiasm, rambled on about the
coming game with Michigan
State. “That Michigan State club
could be the best in the country,
but those kids might just upset
’em if I can stay out of their way.”


OUTSTANDING LINEMAN OF THE WEEK
Stafford's George Honore. will team with one of three Card quarter-backs
in an effort to upset heavily-favored Michigan State next
weekend. Honore was honored after grabbing seven passes for 103
yards against Oregon State.
