# Seven Sports Slated for Fall Mural Program
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Stanford’s fall quarter intra
mural athletic program opens
next Monday, with seven sports
offered for Stanford men. The
sports to be held this quarter are
touch football, bowling, two-man
volleyball, cross country, boxing,
basketball free-throws, and gym
nastics.
Intramurals are offered to give
all boys enrolled, who can’t com
pete in varsity, junior-varsity, or
freshman sports, a chance to par
ticipate in athletic activities. They
include not only the major sports,
but many others to make for a
widely diversified program.
RESULTS in the fall quarter,
as well as winter and spring quar
ters, are counted in determining
the University champion through
a point system. Champion for the
last two years has been Sigma
Chi fraternity.
The greatest number of boys
compete in basketball. Other ma
jor sports held in winter and
spring quarters include wrestling,
track, and softball.
THE INTRAMURAL program
is actively striving to present a
more diversified program, adding
new sports such as gymnastics
whenever there is enough student
interest.
“One major problem,” remarks
the intramural director, “is that
of getting referees. The intra
mural program still needs some
for all sports and will pay them a
salary of $1.50 a game.”
