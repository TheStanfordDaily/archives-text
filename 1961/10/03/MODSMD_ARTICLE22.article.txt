# Stanford Soccer Team Fourth in Tourney
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
An under-practiced Stanford soccer team finished fourth in the
Northern California Intercollegiate Soccer Conference Tournament
held last weekend at USF’s Ulrich Field.
The Indians won their first-round game against San Jose State
2-1, and lost their semi-final match to California 5-3. USF blanked
the Tribe 3-0 in the finale for third place.

Stanford Soccer Coach Fred-
Priddle said the results didn’t sur
prise him, since many of the Stan
ford players had only one or two
days of practice, while the other
teams competing in the tourna
ment had at least two weeks or
more working together.
Priddle pointed out that in par
ticular Stanford would have to
work on coordination between the
goalie and the deep defensive
backs, since sloppy play there en
abled Cal to get two undeserved
goals, and USF one.
ON THE WHOLE, Priddle said
he was satisfied with the results,
and expects Stanford to be in the
thick of the NCISC championship
race. He praised the entire Stan
ford front line, composed of Mike
Tippett, Albert Nnoli, Emmanuel
Andah, Larry Chukwedebe, and
Adam Bianchi, and the defensive
work of halfback Rune Engebrett
sen.
Stanford looked impressive in
beating San Jose State Saturday
2-1. The Tribe had to work hard
to overcome strong defensive
work by the Spartan goalie, but
Nnoli and Andah combined to
give Stanford the winning tally
halfway through the final period.
Nnoli had earlier scored Stan
ford’s first goal with the aid of a
fine pass from Bianchi.
The Stanford defense was hard
put to keep up with a speedy
Spartan forward line headed by
former all-conference wing Joe

Battaglini, and Olympic sprinters
Dennis Johnson and Jim Omag
bemi.
SUNDAY against Cal, Stanford
had the game locked up in the
barn 3-2 with six minutes left in
the game thanks to scores by Tip
pett, Bianchi, and Chukwedebe,
the latter’s only 30 seconds after
the second half began.
The defense fell apart and
handed Cal three gift goals in
succession, and presented the
game to the eventual champions
of the tournament.
The final game was a ho-hum
affair that gave Stanford a chance
to test green reserves under game
conditions.
ALTHOUGH Priddle wouldn’t
say so, it was apparent that Stan
ford’s front liners were tired from
having played a full game only
two hours before, plus being out
of condition from lack of practice.
