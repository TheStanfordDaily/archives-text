# Mantle Doubtful Series Starter
## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPI) Mickey
Mantle tonight became a doubtful
starter in tomorrow’s World
Series opener against the Cinder
ella Cincinnati Reds but there was
enough power left, headed by rec
ord-setting Roger Marls, to keep

the New York Yankees a solid 11
to 5 favorite.
“If I feel the way I feel now 1
can’t play Wednesday,” Mantle
mourned as he appeared at a Yan
kee workout but merely put on
his uniform, looking tired and
wan as result of a heavy cold.
