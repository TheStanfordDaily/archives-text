# SPEECH SABOTAGED
## De Gaulle Appeals for Unification 
### 
PARIS (UPI i President
Charles De Gaulle appealed last
night for national unity to combat
the mounting wave of terrorism,
continued bloodshed and the
haunting fear of civil war. His
television speech was sabotaged
in Algeria.
DeGaulle threatened to resume
supreme dictatorial powers to
guide France through its “hard
and dangerous passage.” He said
he would dissolve Parliament and
hold a nationwide referendum
vote if France becomes embroiled
in another grave political crisis.
HIS SPEECH was broadcast at
8 p.m. here and in Algeria but in
the West Algeria Port of Oran
settler extremists sabotaged it by
blowing up transmission cables 10
minutes before the broadcast was
due to begin, darkening screens
throughout the city.
The action in Oran, crippled to
day by a 30-minute strike called
on orders of the secret army or
ganization (OAS), followed simi
lar moves recently in Algiers
where the OAS twice took over a
TV station to broadcast anti-De
Gaulle statements.
De Gaulle’s voice was stern as
he told the nation;
“If it should happen that the
political situation endangered the
regular functioning of the authori
ties, government and Parliament,
and in these threatening times
endangered the very destiny of
the country, then the people would
have to make its decision known
by the means open to it.”
DE GAULLE had abandoned
last Saturday the emergency
powers ho assumed during the
April Generals’ revolt in Algeria
but warned he would not hesitate
to use them again if necessary.
“They remain, in their fullest
possible extent, the supreme
guarantee for the country and the
state,” he said.
De Gaulle spoke against this
background:
• Movements against De Gaulle
have been reported in right-wing
circles in Fiance and extremists
recently tried to assassinate him
with a plastic bomb.
• The OAS is openly defying
his regime in Algeria and has car
ried out a series of demonstra
tions, including a half-hour work
stoppage yesterday.
