# U.S. Turns Down Russ Proposal For '1 plus 3' U.N. Administrators
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y, (UPI)
The United States yesterday
rejected Russia’s proposal for an
interim secretary general and
three deputies to succeed the late
Dag Hammarskjold.
Although the Soviet delegation
insisted its proposal not yet
offered formally - provided for
a veto-free administration of the
United Nations, U.S. Ambassador
Adlai E. Stevenson said it main
tained the “troika” idea and would
divide the world organization into
three blocs.
DESPITE U.S. opposition, ex
planation of the plan circulated
by the Soviet delegation yesterday
found favor among many of the
“neutral” delegations. While few
were ready to announce full sup
port for it, several said it con
tained the groundwork for com
promise on the threatened dead
lock in choosing a new head for
the United Nations.
The Soviet explanation did not
present the plan in resolution
form. As obtained by UPI and
published last week, the Soviet
draft resolution declares that:

“The General Assembly, on the
recommendation of the Security
Council, as a temporary measure
up until April 1963, invites Mr. X
to organize the work of the Secre
tariat together with Mr. A. Mr. B
and Mr. C, his deputies, and be
lieves that their persons will do

their utmost to act in common
agreement in discharging the
functions of the Secretariat which
haw been entrusted to it by the
U.N. Charter.”
ON BOTH the Soviet “one-plus
three" proposal and the Western
backed plan for the Assembly to
appoint a single interim adminis
trator to replace Hammarskjold,
there appeared to be general ac
cord that agreement on principle
should be reached first and agree
ment on the man or men to fill the
void sought later.
Soviet delegates have said pri
vately that an African should get
the top post, but not General As
sembly President Mongi Slim,
who has considerable U.S. senti
ment for the job. The Russians
indicated acceptability of a candi
date from Nigeria, perhaps For
eign Minister Jaja Wachuku.
Meanwhile, the Security Coun
cil yesterday postponed a show
down on membership applications
of Outer Mongolia and Mauri
tania, the outcome of which might
decide Nationalist China’s future
in the United Nations.
