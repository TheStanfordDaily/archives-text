Lyle Nelson’s a different kind
of salesman.
His product isn’t tangible but
he must convince the world out
side Stanford’s sandstone Quad
that Stanford is just as valuable
and necessary as freeways or mis
siles.
Nelson took over Sept. 1 as
head of Stanford’s office of Uni
versity Relations. His job is sell
ing the educational objectives and
operations of the University.
Nelson says he must “gain
widespread understanding and
support of the nature of a major,
complex university such as Stan
ford, of its ... goals and projects.”
THE CREW-CUT Nelson feels
that only after the community
has “understood” how and why a
modern, major private university
functions and knows its goals
can “support” bo gained.
He’s enthusiastic about his job.
“I can't wait to get in the office
in the morning because there are
so many things to do.” he ex
plains.
As head of the University’s pub
lic relations setup, the 43-year-old
Nelson will run a large, varied
operation.

l'M>i;i! HIS direction are the
News and Publications office, the
film and television office, alumni
and community relations and di
rection of University publications.
He also will advise President
Wallace Sterling on public rela
tions matters.
Establishment of a pexmanent
office came as a “recognition of
the need to . . . centralize such ac
tivities in one place,” he says.
NELSON feels the best way to
deal with people is “on a direct
person-to-person basis.”
Ho comes to Stanford after four
years as vice president in charge
of university relations at the 24,-
000-student University of Michi
gan, where he had the additional
job of helping explain the univer
sity’s needs to the state legisla
ture.
A journalism graduate of the
University of Oregon in 1941, Nel
son spent eight years there as a
journalism teacher and assistant
to the president.
HE WORKED his way through
college by writing “wild West
stories” for magazines.

| Stanford by “my conviction that
; Stanford University has one of
| the brightest futures in the nation
| and by the booming growth of the
West.”
He and his wife and two daugh
ters live in a home on campus.
