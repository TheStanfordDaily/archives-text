# Syrian Broadcast Calls for Egyptians To Overthrow Rule
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon—(UPl)—Damascus Radio in newly inde
pendent Syria broadcast an appeal last night to Egyptians to revolt
against the ride of President Gamal Abdul Nasser.
The broadcast, heard here, said the appeal was signed by 17
politicians “working in the national and nationalist fields” in Syria.

“The Arab people in Syria who
were freed from oppression and
domination by the nationalist
movement of the army, extend
their hands to brotherly Arab
peoples in Egypt, who are fettered
with chains, to free themselves
from the dictatorial rule which
caused separation between Egypt
and Syria,” the Syrian broadcast
said.
THE radio call to Egyptians to
revolt against Nasser followed an
announcement by the Syrian revo
lutionary government that Lt. Col.
Hamid El-Serraj, shadowy strong
man who became Nasser’s right
hand man in Syria, had been ar
rested.
The charges were that he had
tried to “subvert” the Thursday
revolution that tore Syria loose
from Nasser’s United Arab Re
public. Syrian sources in Beirut
said the arrest might end the vest
pocket demonstrations being fo
mented in Syria by Egyptians.
If the Egyptians respond to the
call to revolt against Nasser the
“Arab people in both countries
could then meet and work to
gether for the achievement of
Arab nationalist aims,” the Syri
an broadcast said.
THE broadcast came just five
days after the Syrian army rose
against the United Arab Republic.
One of the signatories to the
revolt call, according to Damascus
Radio, was Akram Al-Hawranin,
former Vice President and Justice
Minister of the U.A.R. Al-Haw
ranin had resigned from the Cen
tral U.A.R. Cabinet and was not
a member of the new government
appointed last Aug. 16.
Damascus Radio said another
one of the signers was Salah Al-
Bitar, a former Cultural and Na
tional Guidance Minister.
A SYRIAN communique report
ing Serraj’s arrest hinted he
might have been trying to seize
power himself for “personal self
ishness.” For years Serraj has
been reported on the verge of at
tempting a coup in Syria when he
thought the time was ripe.
Serraj resigned as U.A.R. vice
president and returned to Damas
cus two days before the Syrian
army revolted. There were re
ports at first he had led the revo
lution but later disclosures said
he had opposed it.
UPI dispatches from Damascus
reported the nation calm under
the leadership of Premier Ma
moun Al-Kuzbari, although Nas
ser continued to insist in a Cairo
speech that fighting has gone on
since Thursday as part of a popu
lar movement to “save the United
Arab Republic.”
Reports reaching Beirut said
Gen. Mohammad Al-Jarrah, for
mer Security Chief in Damascus,
also was under arrest and would
be tried in a military court for at
tempting a counter-revolution and
for crimes committed under the
U.A.R. regime.
