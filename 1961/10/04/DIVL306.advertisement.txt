THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME
It happens every day. A young man goes off to college, leaving
his home town sweetheart with vows of eternal love, and then
he finds that he has outgrown her. What, in such cases, is the
honorable thing to do?
Well sir, you can do what Rock Sigafoos did.
IMien Hock left Cut and Shoot, Pa., he said to his sweetheart,
a simple country lass named Toss d’ Frbevillos, “My dear,
though I am far away in college, 1 will love you always. I will
never look at another girl. If ,1 do, may my eyeballs parch and
wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may the moths get
my new tweed Jacket I”
Then he clutched Tess to his bosom and planted a final kiss
upon her fragrant young skull and went away, meaning with all
his heart to be faithful.
Hut on the very first day of college he met a coed named
lata Morgana, a girl of such sophistication, such poise, such
savoir-faire as Rock had never beheld. She spoke knowingly of
Franz Kafka, she hummed Mozart, she smoked Marlboros.

Now, Rock didn’t know Franz Kafka from Pancho Villa, or
Mozart from James K. Polk, but Marlboros he knew full well.
He knew that anyone who smoked Marlboros was modern and
advanced and as studded with brains as a ham with cloves.
Good sense tells you that you can’t beat Marlboro’s exclusive
selectrate filter, and you never could beat Marlboro’s fine flavor.
This Rock knew.
So all day he followed Fata around campus and listened to her
talk about Franz Kafka, and then in the evening he went back
to the dormitory and found this letter from his home town
sweetheart Toss:
Dear Rock,
I T s kills hail a keen time yesterday. We went down to the
pond and caught same frogs. / caught the most of anybody.
Then we hitched rides on trucks and did lots of nutsy stuff
like that. Will, I mast dose now because I got to whitewash
the fence.
Your friend,
Tess
P.S. —I ran do my Hula Hoop 3,000 limes.
Well sir, Rock thought about Tess and then he thought
about Fata and then a great sadness fell upon him. Suddenly
he knew he had outgrown young, innocent Tess; his heart now
belonged to smart, sophisticated Fata.
Hock, being above all things honorable, returned forthwith
to his home town and walked up to Tess and looked her in the
eye and said manlily, “I do not love you any more. I love a
girl named Fata Morgana. You can hit me in the stomach with
all your might if you like.”
“That’s okay, hey,” said Tess amiably. “I don’t love you
neither. I found a new boy.”
“What is his name?” asked Rock.
“Franz Kafka,” said Tess.
“A splendid fellow,” said Rock and shook Toss’s hand, and
they have remained good friends to (his day. In fact. Rock and
Fata often double-date with Franz and Tess and have heaps of
fun. Franz can do the Hula Hoop 0,000 times.
