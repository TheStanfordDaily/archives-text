ARE YOU PREPARING
FOR YOUR FUTURE’
At Stanford young men and women can prepare themselves to be leaders
of the future. From Stanford a reasonable number can expect to move into the
top echelons of government, industry, the military and its subsidiary professions,
the physical and biological sciences.
Yes, the present generation of leaders is eager to pass along to you its
"realism," games theories and capacity for overkill"; its fallout shelter de
signs and its readiness to push the button if necessary." With this know
how" you can go far. If you learn your lessons well, and have a father who
is a millionaire, you may even become President.
So don't think or question, just prepare for that future—if it comes. Along
the way you II have to read some required and recommended books. Buy them
at KEPLER'S, so Kepler can prepare for his future, (And you thought he wasn't
"realistic.”)
