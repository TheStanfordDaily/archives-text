NATURAL
SHOULDER
SUITS!
! i . t
Phelps-Terkel natural
shoulder clothing studiously
avoids the “extreme”
look. It reflects the
reasonable approach of an
easy, comfortable coat
with trim conservative
lines.
There are “fringe benefits”,
too, because a P-T
“natural" gives you not
only physical comfort, but
adds the comfort of
assured good taste, “at
ease" in any company.
In traditional worsteds,
sharkskins, and
herringbones, also in the
popular dacron-worsted
fabrics for lighter
year round wear.
