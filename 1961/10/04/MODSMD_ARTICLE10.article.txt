### 
DAMASCUS (UPl)—Damascus
Radio yesterday accused Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s
brother of helping to mastermind
a multi-million dollar smuggling
ring to exploit Syrian merchants.
The charge against Laithi Abdel
Nasser was the latest in a series
of attacks against the United
Arab Republic since the revolt
last Thursday against Cairo.
Nasser was getting support on
one front, however, as Arab stu
dents at Stanford and the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley
cabled him their ‘‘admiration for
the courageous and statesmanlike
decision you have taken to avoid
shedding of Arab blood.”
They also expressed the “hope
that your inspired leadership may
yet salvage the U.A.R. as the nu
cleus of Arab unity,” and “our
pledge that we shall alw'ays labor
and sacrifice for the fulfillment of
Arab hopes for total Arab unity
and the triumph of Arab Nation
alism.”
Ahmed el-Mahdy signed the
statement for the Stanford Arab
Students Association.
They also cabled Dr. Mamoun
Kouzbari. Syrian leader, their
urging “to steer the course of
Syria’s affairs within the frame
work of Arab solidarity and in the
spirit of Arab nationalism.” and
“to spare no effort to salvage the
Union as the nucleus of total Arab
unity.”
