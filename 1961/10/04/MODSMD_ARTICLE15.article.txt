						Witch Hunt Ends In Nation's Capital

A witch hunt aimed at mining the lives of a group of Americans
—some accused of being Communists—who are protesting federal
subversive control laws ended yesterday in the nation’s Capital.
The House Committee on Un-American Activities said it was
trying to establish the link, “if any,” between the Communist Party
and two organizations working to have the laws repealed. As usual,
the committee told the press it was investigating so that it might
recommend legislation to the Congress—its theoretical job.
What really happened was that a group of persons, some prob
ably Communists, some not, felt the law was not good. They want
to get rid of it. The catch is that it is in the area of control of Com
munists, an area in which the HUAC feels no law can be too strong
or illegal.
So, following the pattern it has used since 1938, the HUAC
called “hearings” to examine the subject. Apparently, committee
Chairman Francis Walter or one of the other committee members
felt a need for publicity for himself or the committee. And so the
smear began.
Witnesses brought before the committee were asked a large
number of questions, many of them totally irrelevant to the subject.
For a number of reasons, they pleaded the Fifth Amendment—a
right guaranteed them under the Constitution. (It is ironic that a
committee of Congress is in the position of undermining the Con
stitution, while citizens, including some Communists, are uphold
ing it.)
After getting absolutely nowhere and after spending a good
amount of the taxpayers’ money, the “hearing” adjourned.
A few ruined lives and additional smothering of civil liberties
were the only result, the same and only result the committee has
obtained in its 23 years of unfortunate existence.
One witness called told the committee he wouldn’t give them
“ice in the winter or sunshine in the summer.” We would be satis
fied if Congress wouldn’t give them money in January when their
appropriation comes up.
How long this blight on the American system of democracy will
go on is anybody’s guess. We do know that it must be eliminated,
for the HUAC is, today, just as much a danger to civil liberties as
the Communist Party.
