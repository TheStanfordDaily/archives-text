## U.S. Congo Students 
### CARL OLIVER Exchange Editor 
Throe Congolese students who
want to ignore Negro-white racial
conflict in the U.S. South are
studying at University of Oregon.
In an interview with Yvonne
Eggers, assistant managing editor
of the Oregon Daily Emerald,
three undergraduate students
from Leopoldville, the Congo,
said they would prefer to “close
our eyes’' on U.S. segregation.
“We don’t have time for your
problems,” they said. “We have
enough problems of our own.”
The three students said segrega
tion and prejudice exist in every
country.
THE INTERVIEW was held
over dinner at a Eugene, Ore.,
restaurant. It was Miss Eggers’
second attempt to talk to some of
the 13 Congolese who began study
ing at the University of Oregon
this fall.
Miss Eggers reports that her
first interview attempt failed. The
13 students were present with
their university adviser, Charles
Byrne. professor of education.
She says Prof. Byrne introduced
her to the Congolese and told
them she would like to ask some
questions.
BYRNE: “What do you want to
ask them?”
REPORTER: “Oh, I’d just to
talk to them.”
BYRNE: “You tell me your
question and I’ll ask it so they will
understand.”
REPORTER: “What do you ex
pect to find at the University?”
BYRNE: “What do you expect
to find at the University?”
Miss Eggers says a Congolese
student, about 25 and dressed in
a tan suit, started to answer.
Byrne pointed to another student
standing in a corner and asked
him to answer instead.
The student began to answer,
Miss Eggers says, but Byrne in
terrupted with; “You expect to
learn about American culture,
don’t you?” The student said yes.
BYRNE told Miss Eggers that
the student expects to learn about
American culture.
REPORTER: “What do they
think of the training they received
in the mission schol in Africa?”

BYRNE: “That is too delicate a
question to ask them.”
REPORTER: "I understand
they were in Washington this
summer. What do they think of
the American political system?”
BYRNE: “They are too imma
ture to answer that question.”
(Miss Eggers says the men
range in age from 21-30. A few are
married and left families behind
in Leopoldville.)
REPORTER: “I think it would
be better to have this interview
at a later date.”
BYRNE: “Yes, it would be bet
ter to wait. They are still too
young and immature to answer
your questions.’
Interview number two was held
three days later. Three of the stu
dents joined Miss Eggers and
Emerald News Editor Keith Pow
ell at dinner. Adviser Byrne was
not along. Miss Eggers and Pow
ell say the Congolese “freely dis
cussed both African and American
traditions and customs. They said
they were eager to learn new
ideas which may help their own
country grow.”
During the interview the Con
golese said that “when European
countries came to Africa they
tried to force European traditions
on us. Soon a young Congolese
would be embarrassed to sing his
own country’s songs. Now we
want to choose what is best from
other cultures.”
They said it is too early in the
Congo’s development as an inde
pendent nation to judge which
ideas will be useful and which
should be discarded. At this point
in their U.S. education, they said,
they are not willing to judge, but
are simply willing to learn.
THEY SAID they are impressed
by the material wealth of Ameri
cans. “Almost everyone is rich.
Most anyone can own a car,” they
said.
Asked what they thought about
football, the students said they
had seen their first game “yes
terday” (Oregon vs. Idaho). “It
was wonderful.”
After the game, said the Con
golese, they formed a team in the
dorm and spent the rest of the
afternoon passing and punting
down the hall.
