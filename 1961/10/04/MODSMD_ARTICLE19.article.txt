In the editorial ... of The Daily
. . . Oct. 2, this . . . appeared:
“If a Communist or Nazi or left
handed cricket player is willing
to help us defend our civil liber
ties, we are prepared to accept
that help.”
This assumes that a Communist
or Nazi might want to defend our
civil liberties. Anyone . . . keeping
up with the news of the world
should realize that this is not one
of the Communist wants.
Anyone who had studied the
Communist philosophy would not
even have to be up on world af
fairs to know that this assump
tion is incorrect. If a Communist
were interested in civil liberties
he could write a book on why
there should be free elections in
Cuba or Germany or he could de
plore the lack of civil liberties in
Russia and Red China where there
is a real lack.
... If we are to be honest we
must admit that a Communist has
as his goal, not the civil liberties
of people anywhere (especially in
America), but world domination.
One of his most used means to
ward that ... is deception of the
people of the world.
In the case of civil liberties the
Communist deceives ... by blow
ing up and exaggerating any mis
takes or questionable decisions
made by any governmental agen
cy. He presents these occurrences
as . . . the common policy of the
agency.
In turn he uses this “common
policy” as evidence for the aboli
tion of all agencies which are in
vestigating Communist subver
sion in the U.S. and the rest of
the world.
... I feel that we should be very
wary of a Communist or Com
munist sympathizer who comes to
“help” us defend our civil liber
ties.
... I would have been very dis
illusioned if I had joined with
Castro because he promised liber
ty and free elections and then had
me shot because I demanded these
things after he took control. This
... we risk when we accept the
so-called "help” of the Commun
ists.

Editor, The Daily:
In the editorial ... of The Daily
. . . Oct. 2, this . . . appeared:
“If a Communist or Nazi or left
handed cricket player is willing
to help us defend our civil liber
ties, we are prepared to accept
that help.”
This assumes that a Communist
or Nazi might want to defend our
civil liberties. Anyone . . . keeping
up with the news of the world
should realize that this is not one
of the Communist wants.
Anyone who had studied the
Communist philosophy would not
even have to be up on world af
fairs to know that this assump
tion is incorrect. If a Communist
were interested in civil liberties
he could write a book on why
there should be free elections in
Cuba or Germany or he could de
plore the lack of civil liberties in
Russia and Red China where there
is a real lack.
... If we are to be honest we
must admit that a Communist has
as his goal, not the civil liberties
of people anywhere (especially in
America), but world domination.
One of his most used means to
ward that ... is deception of the
people of the world.
