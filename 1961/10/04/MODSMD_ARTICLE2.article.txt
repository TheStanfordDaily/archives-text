Russian scientists show a strik
ing enthusiasm for the Commun
ist government and ideology and
consider themselves freer in many
ways than their - American coun
terparts, Dr. Konrad Krauskopf
said last night.
Krauskopf, associate dean of
the School of Mineral Sciences, re
ported this opinion from his talks
with Russian geologists on a visit
to the U.S.S.R. earlier this year.
KRAUSKOPF cautioned that
the opinions he heard expressed'
were likely to be colored by the
favorable position of the scientist
in Russia. However, he also
stressed that these opinion were
neither forced nor restricted.
Russians he spoke with felt that
communism was “the hope of the
world.” He found that “behind
military strength is a great deal
of moral strength.” However, he
went on to say that this enthusi
asm was, from other reports he
had heard, “by no means univer
sal.”
THE LACK of material com
forts in the Soviet Union, the sci
entists felt, was of “secondary im
portance.” They expressed a feel
ing that “things were getting
better,” and that within a few
years the problem of consumer
goods would be a thing of the
past.
Russians were especially proud
of freedom of opportunity, and
in particular opportunity for edu
cation. They also claim freedom
to change jobs and. very impor
tant to them, freedom from eco
nomic worry.
.SPEECH was not restricted ex
cept in writing and public speak
ing although the Russians admit
ted that this was a recent devel
opment. Freedom of information
was lacking. A Russian finds it
difficult to read conflicting opin
ion on a subject. A second free
dom Russians lack is that of
travel beyond the Soviet Union.
The Russians claimed free elec
tions. They feel that the Commun
ist party wins because its candi
dates are carefully and democrat
ically chosen by a local council.
Voting is felt to represent the
unified approval of the electorate,
Krauskopf said.
