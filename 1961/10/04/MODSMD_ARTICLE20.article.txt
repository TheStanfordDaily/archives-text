Editor, The Daily:
I have been an attentive reader
of The Daily for two years, and I
have watched the steady trend
toward liberalism among the edi
torial staff with increasing fear.
Your Oct. 2 editorial on “Brave”
Barry Goldwater served as the
“straw that broke the camel’s
back,” as Nitze (sic) would put it.
We have been locked in a cold
war with Russia for the past 15
years, and we have been losing
it. ... Very few liberals would
question that. Now, if we are
losing the battle with the Com
munists, whose sole ambition is
the dominance of all the free peo
ple of the world, the question
arises, what are we going to do
about it?
Most Americans will admit that
Cuba represents the grossest mis
management of our foreign af
fairs in the past few years.
When Castro made his tour of
the U.S. shortly after the victory
of the revolutionary forces, he
promised us that Cuba would soon
have free elections and a federal
constitution modeled on ours.
Cuba never got these. Soon, he
initiated his reign of terror which
continues. . . .
U.S. property was not spared
as the revolutionaries strength
ened their hold on the island. Af
ter Guevara, a known Communist,
began flirting with Red China and
the U.S.S.R., President Kennedy
supported the small-scale invasion
of Cuba, which was doomed from
the start.
Castro represents to the average
Latin American, an experiment.
Ho is the first Latin leader to
openly defy the U.S., with the ex
ception of Juan Peron, but now
he is in serious economic trouble.
The rest of Latin America is
watching the experiment.
If we now hold out the hand of
friendship to a man who executes
his political rivals, exiles top col
lege professors because they are
not socialists, wages an open war
on the Roman Catholic Church,
and steals U.S. property, what is
to prevent other Latin American
nations from doing the same
thing? If you can have your pie
and eat it too, then why not do so?
Tony Daiiphiuot
Editor, The Daily:
It grieves me to differ with the
eminent editor of our Daily, es
pecially since he stated in Mon
day’s editorial that “It is ridicu
lous to say that a given utterance
is untrue merely because we dis

agree with the philosophy of who
ever said it.” The editor has dis
agreed with Mr. Goldwater’s poli
cy on Cuba for that reason, so I
will have to take the liberty of do
ing the same ridiculous thing that
he has done.
We must pass beyond the era
of giving candy to our southern
neighbor in order to make him
like us. What he needs is a good
switching out in the tool shed—
even though child psychologists
would disapprove. Goldwater may
not have the best switch, but the
fact that the editor is contempor
ary is no indication that the editor
has the answer.
Several contemporaries have
made more mistakes than my fa
vorite fossil, Mr. Goldwater.
I also mention that if a Com
munist, Nazi, or left-handed writ
er is willing to help me defend my
civil liberties, my vision is not so
fogged by ideologies that I can
not see that he is ultimately de
termined to destroy me and my
civil liberties. The Party is subtle,
or hadn’t you heard.
Konald B. Swenson
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Mitcham’s “entweder-oder”
solution in consideration of Red
China’s admission to the U.N.
proves interesting. Mr. Mitcham
■states that recently and through
out its history the U.S. has vi
olated the territorial integrity of
other nations and should be con
sidered no holier than Red China.
But judged on a historical basis,
no nation is therefore “a virgin,”
and fit for U.N. membership.
When shall we evoke the U.N. to
apply mass expulsion?
The “oder” to Mr. Mitcham’s
solution is to reconsider the
grounds for rejection of admission
of Red China to the U.N. Let us
turn to the grounds for expulsion,
for paradoxically they do have
relevancy in the question of ad
mission.
Examining the leverage of
Chapter 11, Article 5, one realizes
the large dichotomy between the
absolute aim of the U.N. and its
relative policies.
Yet, when the U.N. arose mo
mentarily from its torpor and
gave its blessings to “preventive
action” in . . . Korea, the declared
aggressor was Red China.
Believing man to have radically
changed . . . since the Kellogg-
Briand Pact and the League of
Nations, the U.N. signed the char
ter in . . . 1945. Unfortunately,
the conditions for peace are just

as transient now as they were
then. This, of course, is not to
discount a striving for peace, but
we cannot constantly yield to the
plunderer simply because a world
body theoretically offers protec
tion.
I shall accept the actions of the
U.N. toward . . . peace if they are
consistently directed toward that
goal and do not . . . overlook the
territorial violations of Commun
ism in favor of debate on Bizerte.
Yet the Belgrade conference has
proven a “conscience of mankind”
to be sadly absent. . . . Non-inter
vention can be effective as a
moral principle only if practiced
by all nations. Otherwise, it has
been retaliatory threats that have
maintained (he “teritorrial integri
ty” of Quomoy, Matsu, and the
Berlin corridor, and I have enough
faith in the actions of the U.S. to
believe that ultimately they will
be beneficial to the . . . world.
Eric Valentine
Editor, The Daily;
In the editorial of Sept. 28 the
editors stated; “World govern
ment, under international law
which can he enforced, appeal’s to
be the only solution which can
permanently keep the world from
blowing up . . . tomorrow.”
The editors have apparently
failed to examine the cause of the
present threat to peace. The cause
is that one country intends to
bury us and rule the world. The
threat of world war will remain
as long as the present policies of
U.S.S.R. are maintained unless of
course we decide to let them rule
us without a fight.
As has been demonstrated since
1945 and reiterated again yester
day by Gromyko, that U.S.S.R.
will not allow any internal mili
tary inspection. Clearly U.S.S.R.
will comply to international law
only when it is expedient.
U.S.S.R. is therefore the threat
that leads you to want world gov
ernment and also the reason it
won't work.
