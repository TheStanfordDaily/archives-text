## Freedom Riders OK 
### ILENE STKEELITZ 
“Stop that singing or- I’ll take
your mattresses away.” Each girl
in her small cell containing a
metal bed, a mattress and a small
sink not only stopped singing, but
didn’t utter a sound for 24 hours.
As a punishment for the “silent
treatment,” the guards took the
mattresses away. But there were
no complaints, just more singing,
for the girls were imprisoned free
dom riders. And the philosophy of
their entire movement is one of
passive resistance.
The freedom riders are accus
tomed to harsh treatment, almost
seem to thrive on it. Conditions be
come lower and lower, and more
and more students, ministers, and
other battlers for civil liberties
continue to clog Southern jails.
AS FREEDOM riders pull into
one of any number of bus stations
and quietly and integrated
take a seat, they are told to “Move
on or move out.” They don’t, and
are promptly arrested for misde
meanor disturbing the peace.
Alter sentence they are prompt
ly dispensed to cells or work
farms where they stay for 39
days before posting bail ton which
there is a 40 day limit).
Freedom rides are indicative of
a new spirit in American youth
spontaneity. There is no “master
plan” for when a ride is to take
place or where it is to go. Off
shoots of lunch counter sit-ins be
gun by Southern students, the
rides face unknown problems
ahead as cases are appealed
through the state courts, where
the guilty verdict will be upheld.
Not until a case reaches the Su
preme Court can a reverse de
cision he expected.
IX THE MEANTIME the jails
will get fuller and fuller. Missis
sippi has reached the point where
the white girls from the freedom
rides (everything is segregated in
Mississippi) are being placed in
the maximum security unit of the
state penitentiary, better known
as death row. Obviously, extremes
in punishment for misdemeanor
disturbing of the peace are being
reached.
Alarmingly little action for the
protection of the riders has been
offered by Attorney General Rob
ert Kennedy. As the non-violent
riders enter a waiting room, po
lice look on as bystanders put out
cigarettes against them.
Prison authorities ignore hate
letters that reach the prisoners
while they withhold letters from
family and friends.
Extreme heat, cold, lack of
cleanliness characterize the con
ditions voluntarily endured by the
riders. Their task just begins at
this point, though.
AFTER being released on bail,

the riders are called back to a
court of record for a trial, at the
rate of two cases per day. Sen
tences have thus far ranged as
high as 10 years, fines to several
thousand dollars for disturbing
the peace.
Until the decisions are revoked
by the Supremo Court. CORE
(Congress on Racial Equality)
will continue to be in urgent need
of funds to aid in the posting of
bonds and legal aid. They will also
need support, i.e. petitions and
letters to legislators, local CORE
chapters.
In our days of negative politics
ANTI-communism, ANTI-so
cialism, “purge” movements
freedom riders and their ilk offer
a possibility to retreat from the
fearful apathy that McCarthy
like organizations and atmo
spheres bring about. With the af
firmative action of this group, wo
have a return to what might easi
ly be called PRO-American.
