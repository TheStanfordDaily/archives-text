## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPI) A band of
Western “peace marchers,” in
cluding 13 Americans, walked into
Moscow yesterday to complete a
trek that began in San Francisco
10 months ago. But the marchers
were forbidden to make any dis
armament speeches in Red
Square.
The 31 marchers, some dressed
in blue jeans, baggy sweaters and
tennis shoes, were halted by Sovi
et officials 100 yards short of the
Lenin-Stalin tomb in Moscow’s
main square.
The leaders obviously were up
set by the ban. Eight of the Ameri
cans had traveled 8.000 miles
across six countries on two con
tinents to carry their message to
the Russian people.
THKV HAD hoped to make
speeches advocating unilateral
disarmament and an end to nu
clear testing. But the Soviet of
ficials said no speeches would be
permitted.
The officials said a demonstra
tion could be held at the side of
the square in front of the histori
cal museum. After about 30 min
utes of discussions, the marchers
finally were allowed to proceed
to the center of the square in
front of the mausoleum and stand
in a “silent vigil.”
