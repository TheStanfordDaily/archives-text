## Europe Talks to Succeed 
### 
What Gen. Clay said to the
newspapermen at the cocktail
party in West Berlin has aroused
a certain amount of perfunctory
criticism in West Germany and a
perfunctory denial from American
official sources.
As a matter of fact, what he
said has not really been denied,
and it is significant to see that it
has not seriously been opposed.
He said that the West Germans
would have to face the fact that
East Germany exists and that the
hope of eventual reunification lies
in an increasing contact and a ne
gotiation between the two German
states.
ALTHOUGH this is the simple
and obvious truth, it was startling
to find it in print. For this is the
first time that a truly responsible
and informed leader has said out
loud what has long been a com
monplace in pr ivate conversations.
Early in 1958, for example, I
was in Bonn, as well as in Paris,
London, and Berlin. Wherever I
went, it was taken for granted
as being too self-evident for seri
ous discussion that the official
promise of reunification by means
of a general German election was
unrealizable.
The Soviets would not permit
German reunification inside the
Western alliance; the French and
the British did not want it.
ALTHOUGH 1 had known this
much, what surprised me was
what I heard in Bonn from an of
ficial whom I must not identify
but who was both highly respon
sible and fairly informed.
He explained to me at length
that the two Germanys in the past
15 years had grown so far apart
that it was idle now to talk about
reuniting them under a single
elected government.
There are by now enormous ide
ological, religious, and political
obstacles to an attempt to fuse
the historically Protestant and
Socialist East Germany with the
conservative and Catholic West.
These basic difficulties are com
plicated by the relative richness
of West Germany and the poverty
of the East.
I REMEMBER well his telling
mo that the Bonn authorities had
made a very careful study of the
problems and the economic con
sequences of reunification, and
that the study showed that if
West Germany were to be taxed
to finance the rise of the East
German standard of life to the
West German level, it would mean
forcing down the West German
level by about one-third over a
considerable number of years.
Arguing with him, I insisted
that however difficult reunifica
tion was, the danger of permanent
partition was even greater. He did
not deny this. But he replied that
the reunion must come very slow
ly probably in the course of a
generation and that it should
bo approached very gradually.

When I asked him how it should
be approached, he replied that the
two German states already had
practical relations, negotiated by
their officials and embodied in
agreements, which deal with cur
rency matters, trade, and West
German civilian access to Berlin
on the surface.
THESE relations should be mul
tiplied he said, and their levels
should gradually be raised to
higher official forms of recogni
tion, so that eventually Germany
would become a confederation of
the two German states.
This is, of course, Mr. Khrush
chev’s proposal. But 1 heard it
first from this high German offi
cial whose record of loyalty to the
West is impeccable. The idea was
bound to take hold because it fits
so exactly the reality of the Ger
man situation. It ought to surprise
nobody that Gen. Clay talked
about it and that it is now begin
ning to be talked about in West
Germany.
We shall find. I think, that the
European situation will change as
the break-through proceeds from
the official make-believe of Ger
man reunification to the practical
reality of the two Germanys and
their relationships. Mr. Heston re
ported in the New York Times
that there was disappointment in
the White House over the lack of
support in NATO for the Presi
dent’s Berlin policy.
THE WESTERN governments,
knowing that the main architects
of that policy were men who want
ed only to stand firm and stand
pat, saw no future in what they
were told was the President’s poli
cy. After Aug. 13. when the un
realism of the policy was revealed,
there has been a sufficient revival

of positive thinking in Washing
ton to open up the grim deadlock
of the nuclear deaf mutes.
The Germans have a part to
play in opening up the ground for
a constructive European negotia
tion. The effort to bring it about

is a very hard one. But it will suc
ceed, and the world will yet be
led away from the brink to an ac
commodation which it can live
with decently.
