# TRESODDER UNION:
## Should Be Finished Next Fall 
### ALLAN PRAGER 
Two more closed streets, a mas
sive crane and plenty of boards
for bookcases are tangible evi
dence that Tresidder Union, after
12 years of planning, is finally
under construction.
The $2,675,000-structure, slated
to be the center of the whole Stan
ford community, is scheduled to
be completed in September 1962.
The new union, located at the
east end of Santa Teresa Street,
will be the latest addition to the
student activities center, which is
comprised of the bookstore, Din
kelspiel Auditorium, the post of
fice and Tresidder. Upon comple
tion of the Union, the grounds
between these four buildings and
the old union will be relandscaped.
THE BUILDING will include
facilities for food, recreation and
services. A grillroom, a snack bar,
a cafeteria and several intimate
small dining rooms which can be
consolidated into one large dining
room will offer a variety of places
to eat, all of which will be air
conditioned.
The eating area is designed to
give the fastest service possible.
Conduits are now being installed
which will enable students waiting
in line to telephone their orders
ahead so that the food will be
ready when they reach the head
of the line.
Outdoor eating also is planned.
Food can be purchased inside and
eaten under the trees either be
hind or in front of the building.
The two outdoor areas will give
a choice of sun or shade no matter
what the time of day.
THE COURTYARD in the rear
also will feature a cement dance
platform and facilities for out
door art exhibits.
Recreational installations will
be equally extensive. They range
from a 14-lane bowling alloy to
music listening lounges. Other
fixtures are a 10-table billiards
room, a table tennis room with
nine tables, a bridge and chess
room and a music playing lounge.
Other so-called “quiet” facilities
are a reading room, a record and
tape library, a circulating art li
brary, conference rooms, meeting
rooms and two large lounges
which, again, can be converted
into one room when a folding wall
between them is removed.
THROUGH THE new ASSU of
fices student extra-curricular ac
tivities will be centralized in the
Union. ASSU will have a business
office and eight student offices at
its disposal The plans also include
40 work stations plus filing and
storage space.
The service facilities will bring
to the campus a travel service for
students and faculty, a box office
for off-campus events, a 10-chair
barbershop and coin-return lock
ers which will enable students to
lent lockers for temporary use
free of charge.
The Union store in addition to
selling magazines, sundries, drugs
and similar items, will offer deli
cacies and a small gift selection.
Proposed hours for the Union
are 7 a.m, to 11 p.m. daily.
THE UNION has a modern two
level design including the arch and
red tile roof of older Stanford
buildings. Much of the front of
the building will be covered by
30,000 square feet of glass. Circl
ing the outside will be a balcony
on which display cases will be lo
cated. The design also allows for
future construction of a large
banquet-ballroom and additional
student offices and meeting
rooms.
Funds for the construction stem
primarily from the gift of Mrs.
Mary Curry Tresidder in memory
of her husband, Donald B. Tresid
der, who served as the fourth
president of the University from
1943 to 1948.
Other money has come from
funds accumulated by the old
Union, private donations and gov
ernment loans. The project is not
associated with the PACE pro
gram, according to Daniel Rolfs
of the Planning Office.
“THIS IS probably the best
thought through Union that has
ever been built,” said Rolfs. Com
mittees of students and faculty
studied what they felt a union
should contain.
Rolfs credited Chester A. Berry,
director of the Union, for his ef
forts to be sure that the students’
opinions were taken into consider
ation. The design of the Union is
directed toward the needs of stu
dents, their wives, and faculty
members and their families.

the University’s Board of Trustees

fourth president of Stanford, suc
ceeding Ray Lyman Wilbur, who
became chancellor.
HU died on Jan. 28, 1948, at the
age of 54 while on a business trip
to New York City. Dr. Wallace
Sterling succeeded him.

The death of Donald Bertrand
Tresldder, for whom Stanford’s
Tresidder Union is named, caused
newspapers to editorialize:
“He was a Stanford man in the
tradition set by Herbert Hoover
and other’ Stanford pioneers, of
working one’s way through and
afterwards maintaining a strong
personal interest in its fortunes.
“TO that strength and fulfill
ment, Donald Tresidder contribut
ed the full measure of his vision,
his courage, his intellect, his love
of youth and zest, his devotion.
He is part of the proud heritage.”
Dr. Tresidder (he earned his
medical degree at Stanford In
1927) was a native of Indiana. He
came to Stanford via a summer
job in Yosemite Park, where he
met a vacationing Stanford pro
fessor.
He became a physiology student
and, after serving as a World War
I flying lieutenant, won his A.B.
in 1919.
He helped found Stanford Asso
ciates, a group of volunteer fund-

TRESIDDER UNION - ON ITS WAY
As the top picture indicates, construction on the long-awaited Tre-sidder Union is rolling along since the first work started June 26.
View is from the Dinkelspiel parking lot looking toward San Francisco. Bottom picture shows Mrs. Mary Tresidder, Stanford Board
of Trustees President Thomas Pike and W. P. Fuller Jr., former president of the Board, at dedication of the Union July 20. The dedication took place beneath a large, cool oak tree in the Dinkelspiel lot,
and was attended by a group of trustees, high administration officials, faculty, staff and just plain students. At the ceremony, all the
speakers lauded Tresidder for his keen interest in Stanford students
and in the University.
