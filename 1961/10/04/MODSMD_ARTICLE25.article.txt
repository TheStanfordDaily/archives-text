# WORLD SERIES OPENS TODAY
## Mantle Doubtful—New York Favored to Turn Back Reds 
### OSCAR FRALEY 
NEW YORK—(I Pl)—Mickey Mantle of the New York Yankees still was a question mark last
night on the eve of the opening of the World Series as the underdog Cincinnati Reds counted on
pitching to silence the most thunderous home run attack in baseball history.
Fate conspired with the Reds, 9to 5 second choices in the opener at 9 a.in. PST today, when
lefty Whitey Ford, a 25-game winner goes to the mound against the Reds’ Jim O’Toole, a winner of
19 games this season.

Because Mantle, weak and seven
pounds under weight after a bout
with virus and the lancing of a
still draining abscess on his right
hip, announced after a risky jog
in the rain that while he was “en
couraged” he wouldn’t start in the
opener “if 1 feel like I do now.”
The weather, with rain expected
to “continue into today,” thus be
came more and more of a factor.
A postponement would give
Mantle an extra day of recupera
tion and possibly permit him to
rejoin his mates who, led by
Roger Maris with 61, this season
broke all home run records with
a one-club total of 24(1.
The Reds, who hit only 158 in
comparison and lack the World
Series experience of the perennial
American League champions, had
to be hoping thai they could make
a fast getaway while Mantle was
inoperative.

This despite the fact that man
ager Freddie Hutchinson of the
Reds, revealing that he had re
ceived information from the Pitts
burgh Pirates on how they defeat
ed the Yankees in last year’s
series, felt that his pitchers could
handle Mantle, Maris and com
pany.
"The way to stop good hitting,”
he said, "is with good pitching.”
A postponement also would pro
vide another healing day for Red
catcher Dar rell Johnson, who suf
fered a strained left side in a
game against Pittsburgh last Fri
day. So, Hutchinson opined pub
licly, a postponement wouldn’t
bother him, either.
“There’s no nervousness on this
club,” he insisted.
Despite the possible absence of
Mantle from the lineup, which
would shift Maris to center field
and cause manager Ralph Houk to
use Hector Lopez in right, the
Yankee manager asserted, after a
day in which both teams went
over scouting reports on their
rivals, that he was against a post
ponement.
Let’s gel this thing started,” he
said.
Houk, who won the pennant in
his freshman year as manager af
ter succeeding the fired Casey
Stengel, admitted that he had
been “deeply concerned” that
Mantle might miss the entire
Series.
“I'm less concerned now be
cause he says he feels so much
belter,” Houk smiled. “I’m sure
he’ll be available now, even if not
for the opener.” ,

Mantle was itching to play,
though ho still limped noticeably
when he walked, because, like
Maris, he is hoping to make an as
sault on one of the immortal Babe
Ruth’s records. Maris hit the most
homers ever by a ma jor leaguer
this year with his 61, even though
he tailed to surpass Ruth’s mark
ot 60 in the 154-game Rulhian
schedule prior to expansion.
Mantle needs only two home
runs to wipe out Ruth’s mark of
15 home runs in career Series
play.
Ford, the stubby southpaw, also
will be looking for a Series record
when he goes to the mound
against the Reds. His seven total
victories in Series play ties him
with two old Yankee heroes, Red
Ruffing and Allie Reynolds, and
an opening game victory would be
a new all-time mark.
Houk admitted after going over
scouting reports on the Reds that
it might not come with the ease
anticipated by the oddsmakers.
“They’re a good club according
to our reports,” he said as he
watched the Yankees run and
loosen their arms in a restricted
drill. “We all know they have
pitching and they have some men
who can run and some men with
power.”
The Reds didn’t work out in the
steady rain which blanketed Yan
kee Stadium but held a long
locker room session to go over
their information on the Yankees.
A capacity crowd of 70,000 was
expected to be on hand for the
opener, to be televised by NBC.
