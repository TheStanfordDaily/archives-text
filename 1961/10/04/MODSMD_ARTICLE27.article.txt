# Card Gridders Prep for MSU Clash Saturday
## 
### KY BON KAPOPORT 
If playing (he role of the under
dog has had anything to do with
Stanford’s early season football
success, the Indians will have at
least one thing going for them
when they meet Michigan State
at East Lansing, Mich., Saturday.
Consider and take heart from
the pre-game odds on the Tribe’s
first two games of the year.
Against Tulane, Stanford was a
five-point underdog. For beating
the Green Wave the Cards were
rewarded with being placed 12
points under Oregon State by the
oddsmakers. You could have made
a lot of money off Stanford’s 34-0
win over the Beavers.
But for their trouble, the Indi
ans are likely to find themselves
underdogs for the third week in
a row. Maybe it’s all for the best.
In the meantime Stanford head
man Jack Curtice will be putting
his team to work “not on anything
new, hut to improve the things
we’ve been doing.”
Monday’s workout was conduct
ed without the benefit of shoulder
pads and the like, and thus was
short and free of contact. The
session ended with an educational
film entitled “Michigan State
Beats Wisconsin 20-0.” Very in
formative.
The practice session conducted
yesterday was of the more con
ventional variety. Curtice has ex
pressed considerable enthusiasm
at the squad’s balanced attack
with substantially the same yard
age being gained by rushing as
through the air.
“I like to run enough so we can
pass, and pass enough so we can
run,” Curtice says. That sort of
attack keeps the defense loose
and worried.
