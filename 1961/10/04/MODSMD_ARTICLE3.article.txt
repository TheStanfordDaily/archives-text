# Stanford Fighting Army Dam
## 
### 
Stanford opposes a proposed
foothill dam on University prop
erty “because it is overdesigned
and wasteful of vitally important
campus land,” the Palo Alto City
Council public works committee
was told Monday night.
Alf Brandin, vice president for
the University’s business affairs,
said the dam’s reservoir “will ob
literate at least 540 acres of Stan
ford's endowment land.” He de
clared the University definitely
will oppose the dam.
The committee voted, however,
to recommend Council backing of
the Ladera Dam flood control
project.
A SPOKESMAN for the San
Francisco office of the Army
Corps of Engineers said the plan
for the dam would give 8,500-acre
feet for flood control, 3,500-acre
feet for conservation purposes and
600-acre-feet for soil storage.
Cost of the dam was estimated
by the spokesman at $8,399,000.
The federal government would
provide about $4,747,000. with the
rest to bo gained from local in
terests.
Brandin suggested that protec
tion against floods could come
from a smaller, more economical
dam and widening the channel of
San Francisquito Creek across
which the dam would be con
structed.
BUT THE spokesman for the
Army said widening of the creek
would not protect Palo Alto from
the type of flood which hit the
area in 1955 and 1958.
Brandin said that a storage fa
cility of 1,000-acre-feet would have
kept the 1955 flood within the
channel of the creek. He said the
8,500-acre-feet storage area for
Ladera is wasteful and unneces
sary.
Stanford’s opposition to the
project “could be harmful,” the
Army spokesman said.
THE CORPS’ rivers and har
bors committee will hold a hear
ing on the project on Oct. 20 in
Washington, and Stanford plans
to protest at that time.
The dam and its 525-acre reser
voir would extend to Sand Hill
Road, and four-fifths of it would
be in San Mateo County, the rest
in Santa Clara County.
The Ar my spokesman said the
project had been coordinated “so
as not to conflict in any way with
either Stanford’s now linear ac
celerator' or the Division of High
ways plan for the Junipero Serra
Freeway.”

The Ar my spokesman said the
project had been coordinated “so
as not to conflict in any way with
either Stanford’s now linear ac
celerator' or the Division of High
ways plan for the Junipero Serra
Freeway.”
Stanford opposes a proposed
foothill dam on University prop
erty “because it is overdesigned
and wasteful of vitally important
campus land,” the Palo Alto City
Council public works committee
was told Monday night.
Alf Brandin, vice president for
the University’s business affairs,
said the dam’s reservoir “will ob
literate at least 540 acres of Stan
ford's endowment land.” He de
clared the University definitely
will oppose the dam.
The committee voted, however,
to recommend Council backing of
the Ladera Dam flood control
project.
A SPOKESMAN for the San
Francisco office of the Army
Corps of Engineers said the plan
for the dam would give 8,500-acre
feet for flood control, 3,500-acre
feet for conservation purposes and
600-acre-feet for soil storage.
Cost of the dam was estimated
by the spokesman at $8,399,000.
The federal government would
provide about $4,747,000. with the
rest to bo gained from local in
terests.
Brandin suggested that protec
tion against floods could come
from a smaller, more economical
dam and widening the channel of
San Francisquito Creek across
which the dam would be con
structed.
BUT THE spokesman for the
Army said widening of the creek
would not protect Palo Alto from
the type of flood which hit the
area in 1955 and 1958.
Brandin said that a storage fa
cility of 1,000-acre-feet would have
kept the 1955 flood within the
channel of the creek. He said the
8,500-acre-feet storage area for
Ladera is wasteful and unneces
sary.
Stanford’s opposition to the
project “could be harmful,” the
Army spokesman said.
THE CORPS’ rivers and har
bors committee will hold a hear
ing on the project on Oct. 20 in
Washington, and Stanford plans
to protest at that time.
The dam and its 525-acre reser
voir would extend to Sand Hill
Road, and four-fifths of it would
be in San Mateo County, the rest
in Santa Clara County.
