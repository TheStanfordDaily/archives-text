## Come Join the Band’

The Stanford Band program
needs women for secretarial, hos
tess, and other behind-the-scenes
work this quarter.
The first meeting of the Girls’
Band Club will be held at 7:15 to
night in the Band House.

Partcipation in this club is
aimed to provide a good introduc
tion to band procedures so that
the women can make an easier
transition when the symphonic

and concert bands begin in the
winter. These two bands are open
to both men and women.

This year a chapter of Tau Beta
Sigma, the girl’s affiliate to Kap
pa Kappa Psi, the national hon
orary band fraternity, will be
formed from the Girl’s Band Club.
