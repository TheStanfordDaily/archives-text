# Dean Allen Enthusiastic, Seeks to Know Students
## 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
“I’m not afraid for people to
know me; I’m afraid for them
not to.” explained Dr. Lueile
Allen, Stanford’s new dean of
women, during a short afternoon
interview.
Dean Allen, a former profes
sor and dean of women at Cor
nell, “loves Stanford” and con
siders Stanford and Cornell as
sort of “sister schools,” both hav
ing “a tradition of freedom and
responsibility.”
Disliking to talk across the
desk, Dean Allen informally
pulled up a chair for the inter
view, mentioning that it took
two weeks to teach the staff to
leave the chairs near her desk
rather than on the perimeter of
the room.
WITH A TRACE of a Texas
accent, she enthusiastically com
mented, “Everyone I’ve met here
so far has been just great.”
Dynamically interested in new
ideas and an easy person to talk
with. Dean Allen seems a person
who will have no trouble realiz
ing her hope that soon both men
and women will feel at home in
her office.
The new dean emphatically
stated that she does not consider
it her job to “make girls behave”
but believes the students are per
fectly capable of handling most
discipline problems.
IN A NUTSHELL her philoso
phy on discplinary problems
seems to be, “Problems should
be solved on the lowest organi
zational level possible.” She said
when a problem arises she wants
only to ask, “What is the appro
priate committee to deal with
this?”
When asked what part she had
played in the changes in wom
en's social regulations, she simply
answered, “I gave approval to
what the social regulations com
mittee had decided.” And as to
the abolishment of the demerit

system, she said, “I can’t see
what useful purpose the demerit
system served.”
Looking at Stanford with the
fresh eye of a newcomer, Doan
Allen seems ready to ask “why”
about existing rules and to ex
amine the reasons for their ex
istence. Though “not quite sure
what a dean of women at Stan
ford is” her catching enthusiasm
indicates that the dean’s office
will widen its scope of activity
during the coming year.
THE SHORT talk with the
dean revealed her intense inter
est in the changing role of wom
en in our modern society. She
said that American men are an
swering “yes” to the question
“Can intelligent women be lov
able?” and she feels that it is
the job of the dean’s office to
work toward developing women
who are versatile, interesting and
lovable.
The dean has had a varied ca
reer, starting as an Instructor in
English in Texas after graduat
ing from Trinity University. How
ever, she found herself “tired of
reading in freshman themes
about students’ problems and de
cided to do something about
them.”
She soon was in an adminis
trative position in Highland Park
High School in Dallas. Later she
served as consultant and lecturer
in general education and mental
hygiene for the Hogg Founda
tion in Austin, Texas.
After a year of * working as ex
ecutive secretary of the Women’s
Foundation, she served for seven
years as dean of women at Cor
nell University. From 1952 to
1959 she was dean of Chatham
College, a private college for
women in Pittsburgh. The past
two years she worked on faculty
research studies under the Hogg
Foundation at the University of
Texas and also served as an edu
cational consultant at Austin Col
lege in Texas.

NEW DEAN OF WOMEN RELAXED, INFORMAL
Hopes all will feel "at home'' in her office
“I’m not afraid for people to
know me; I’m afraid for them
not to.” explained Dr. Lueile
Allen, Stanford’s new dean of
women, during a short afternoon
interview.
Dean Allen, a former profes
sor and dean of women at Cor
nell, “loves Stanford” and con
siders Stanford and Cornell as
sort of “sister schools,” both hav
ing “a tradition of freedom and
responsibility.”
Disliking to talk across the
desk, Dean Allen informally
pulled up a chair for the inter
view, mentioning that it took
two weeks to teach the staff to
leave the chairs near her desk
rather than on the perimeter of
the room.
WITH A TRACE of a Texas
accent, she enthusiastically com
mented, “Everyone I’ve met here
so far has been just great.”
Dynamically interested in new
ideas and an easy person to talk
with. Dean Allen seems a person
who will have no trouble realiz
ing her hope that soon both men
and women will feel at home in
her office.
The new dean emphatically
stated that she does not consider
it her job to “make girls behave”
but believes the students are per
fectly capable of handling most
discipline problems.
IN A NUTSHELL her philoso
phy on discplinary problems
seems to be, “Problems should
be solved on the lowest organi
zational level possible.” She said
when a problem arises she wants
only to ask, “What is the appro
priate committee to deal with
this?”
When asked what part she had
played in the changes in wom
en's social regulations, she simply
answered, “I gave approval to
what the social regulations com
mittee had decided.” And as to
the abolishment of the demerit

system, she said, “I can’t see
what useful purpose the demerit
system served.”
Looking at Stanford with the
fresh eye of a newcomer, Doan
Allen seems ready to ask “why”
about existing rules and to ex
amine the reasons for their ex
istence. Though “not quite sure
what a dean of women at Stan
ford is” her catching enthusiasm
indicates that the dean’s office
will widen its scope of activity
