# Government Urges Ford, UAW to End Second Auto Strike
## 
### 
DETROIT—(UPI)—The government made appeals last night
to both the Ford Motor Go. and the United Auto Workers Union
to “exert every effort” to end the auto industry’s second major strike.
The strike, the second in the industry in less than a month, was
touched off yesterday morning when Ford and the Union could not
reach agreement on non-economic issues although they agreed on a

national economic pact,
The walkout idled 88 Ford
plants across the nation and called
120,000 production workers off
their jobs.
The Kennedy administration’s
plea for an early settlement of the
dispute was made by Labor Sec
retary Arthur J. Goldberg. He
urged negotiators to settle re
maining issues now that agree
ment has been reached on “a basic
economic settlement.”
GOLDBERG SAID, “The ulti
mate shutdown at Ford is most
regrettable from the standpoint of
everyone concerned the com
pany, the union, and, above all,
the public.”
UAW President Walter P. Reu
ther said the company and union
reached accord on a national econ
omic agreement four hours before
a 10 a.m. strike deadline but that
“there wasn’t time to work out a
full agreement” on non-economic
issues by the deadline.
Malcolm L. Denise, Ford vice
president, said this first company
wide strike against Ford in 20
years was “unnecessary . . , not
over economic issues” and would
cost hourly-paid employes about
$2.6 million a day in lost wages.
REUTHER EMERGED from an
around-the-clock bargaining ses
sion at 10:04 a.m. (EST) to an
nounce the strike was on. He said
negotiations were being recessed
until 10 a.m. today because the
bargainers on both sides were ex
hausted.
“We feel that if we come back
with clear minds, we might be
able to make meaningful prog
ress toward a quick end to the
strike,” he said.
General Motors was plagued by
strikes during much of September
with more than 100 plants closed
and a quarter of a million workers
idled. The last of the walkouts at
GM did not end until eight days
ago.

THE STRIKE action against
GM also was in the non-economic
area. Agreement was reached on
Sept. 6 between the largest of the
car makers and the UAW on a
three-year economic package, but
then the union authorized walk
outs five days later over unre
solved local contract issues.
Reuther said the strike against
Ford was called over such non
economic matters as production
standards, outside contracting oj:
work the union wants its members
to do and union charges that low
er-paid unskilled workers were
being assigned to do the work of
higher-paid skilled employes.

UAW President Walter P. Reu
ther said the company and union
reached accord on a national econ
omic agreement four hours before
a 10 a.m. strike deadline but that
“there wasn’t time to work out a
full agreement” on non-economic
issues by the deadline.
Malcolm L. Denise, Ford vice
president, said this first company
wide strike against Ford in 20
years was “unnecessary . . , not
over economic issues” and would
cost hourly-paid employes about
$2.6 million a day in lost wages.
REUTHER EMERGED from an
around-the-clock bargaining ses
sion at 10:04 a.m. (EST) to an
nounce the strike was on. He said
negotiations were being recessed
until 10 a.m. today because the
bargainers on both sides were ex
hausted.
“We feel that if we come back
with clear minds, we might be
able to make meaningful prog
ress toward a quick end to the
strike,” he said.
General Motors was plagued by
strikes during much of September
with more than 100 plants closed
and a quarter of a million workers
idled. The last of the walkouts at
GM did not end until eight days
ago.

THE STRIKE action against
GM also was in the non-economic
area. Agreement was reached on
Sept. 6 between the largest of the
car makers and the UAW on a
three-year economic package, but
then the union authorized walk
outs five days later over unre
solved local contract issues.
Reuther said the strike against
Ford was called over such non
economic matters as production
standards, outside contracting oj:
work the union wants its members
to do and union charges that low
er-paid unskilled workers were
being assigned to do the work of
higher-paid skilled employes.
DETROIT—(UPI)—The government made appeals last night
to both the Ford Motor Go. and the United Auto Workers Union
to “exert every effort” to end the auto industry’s second major strike.
The strike, the second in the industry in less than a month, was
touched off yesterday morning when Ford and the Union could not
reach agreement on non-economic issues although they agreed on a

national economic pact,
The walkout idled 88 Ford
plants across the nation and called
120,000 production workers off
their jobs.
The Kennedy administration’s
plea for an early settlement of the
dispute was made by Labor Sec
retary Arthur J. Goldberg. He
urged negotiators to settle re
maining issues now that agree
ment has been reached on “a basic
economic settlement.”
GOLDBERG SAID, “The ulti
mate shutdown at Ford is most
regrettable from the standpoint of
everyone concerned the com
