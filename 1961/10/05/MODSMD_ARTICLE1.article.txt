# YOU AND THE PEACE CORPS'
## Peter Grothe to Talk On Job Opportunities 
### 
“You and the Peace Corps,” a talk by Peter Grothe, Special Con
sultant to the Peace Corps, will be given tonight at 7:30 in Cub
herley.
Concentrating especially on the opportunities for Stanford stu
dents in the Peace Corps, Grothe will outline the steps necessary

in order to take the Peace Corpse
exam to be given here Nov. 28 and
29. A student taking the Novem
ber exam will be informed of his
assignment by April.
Grothe. a Stanford political sci
ence graduate student, is one of
the conceivers of the Peace Corps.
Last year while working for Sen.
Hubert Humphrey, he drafted the
original Peace Corps legislation,
christening the idea the “Peace
Corps.”
After the enthusiastic public
response to Humphrey’s proposal,
Grothe suggested to Pres. Ken
nedy’s campaign office that it be
used as part of the campaign.
IN APRIL, Grothe served as
Deputy Director of the U.N.
branch of the Peace Corps, later
representing the Peace Corps at
a UNESCO conference in Paras.
Grothe feels that Stanford is
"unrivaled in its potential for peo
ple qualified for the Peace Corps,
since this is the only university
where so many students have al
ready travelled abroad.”
Because of the large number of
requests from underdeveloped
countries for teachers, the Peace
Corps is looking for people in all
the Liberal Arts disciplines.
AT LEAST two former Stan
ford students are among the 450
people now serving as Peace
Corps members. Susan Hastings,
a geography major, is teaching at
a secondary school in Ghana, and
Bob Saint, who has a master’s de
gree in engineering, is in training
to teach at a technical institute in
East Pakistan.
By Christmas the Peace Corps
is expected to expand to 1,000,
growing to 2,500 by June and to
5,000 by the end of the summer.
Grothe’s talk, sponsored by the
HR and the Political Union is part
of a tour of California colleges
and universities for recruiting stu
dents for the November exam.
Literature on the Peace Corps will
be available at the talk, including
the volunteer questionnaire need
ed in applying to take the exam.
