# BUSH YIELDS BUSHED CLOCK
## 
### 
Stanford University today may have come up with a find that ante
dates Salvador Dali's limp watch concept. Corporation Yard work
men clearing out shrubbery on the west end of Galvez St. side of
Encina Hall discovered the complete works of an alarm clock em
bedded in the crotch of a tree. The works, complete with main
spring, escapement, gear wheels and whatnot, were hoary with age
and the same color as the tree bark. Over the years the tree had
enfolded the backing and facing plates, making the timer an inte
gral part of the tree. Officials theorized that, back in the days when
Encina Hall was a men's dormitory instead of business office, some
slugabed student had hurled his bothersome alarm clock out the
window. The impact disintegrated the. clock and the works landed
in the tree.
