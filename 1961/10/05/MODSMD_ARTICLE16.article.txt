# Legislature Ready For Active Year?
## 
### 
Stanford's student Legislature holds its first meeting tonight, a
fact that in past years would have hardly been worth noting. But
it looks as if this year will be different, for signs are that LASSU
this year will be a vital force in student affairs.
Incoming president Bob Sayler, certainly one of the most ca
pable men ever elected to the post, has the services of a talented
group of ASSU officials—again, probably one of the most talented
groups ever seen in the old Union.
And—what is most important—they appear tp have the time and
interest to make LASSU and the elective student offices positions
of leadership and action on a campus which has seen little of such
leadership and action in recent years.
The list of things which LASSU and the other ASSU organi
zations could do or sponsor is a large one. Presumably, Sayler has
plans to spur some of the groups into “doing something.” He will
need, however, the support of a Legislature willing to work rather
than figure out how best to block student groups that are doing
things.
We hope LASSU will start early on various projects rather than
waiting or putting things off, for one of the main problems with
LASSU in past years is that it has put off until late in the school
year things which could have been done earlier, and as a result has
run out of time when it did start working.
We think LASSU can do a good deal tins year toward leading
campus activities and playing a significant role in campus life. We
think it will.
