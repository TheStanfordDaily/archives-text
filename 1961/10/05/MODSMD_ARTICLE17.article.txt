Stanford students interested in the Peace Corps will have a
unique opportunity tonight to hear the Corps’ functions explained
by a Stanford grad who played a major role in its formation.
Pete Crothe, former foreign policy adviser to Sen. Hubert Hum
phrey (and a former Daihj sports editor), obviously is a dedicated
man. He believes the Corps can accomplish a great deal toward
helping underdeveloped countries in their drive for maturity and
stability through providing persons trained in skills needed in these
countries.

More important, however, he feels the Corps can serve the
noblest possible purpose: man helping man to build a better world.
We agree completely. The Peace Corps is one of the most
imaginative programs put into effect by the United States in a
long time. Its effect in the lands where Peace Corps members are
stationed cannot help hut be significant. And, of course, the image
of the U.S. held in these countries should improve.
But this will be only an offshoot of the program. Its main pur
pose is simple and direct: to help those who need (and ask) for
aid. It is not a propaganda vehicle for U.S. aims, as some would
have it. It is not a plot to spread U.S. “imperialism,” as the Soviets
would have the world believe.

In a world where man too often forgets he is “his brother’s
keeper, the formation of the Peace Corps has confused some per
sons. They are not used to the idea of a great power making it a
national policy to offer help to other nations without expecting
something in return. This is one area where the Kennedy admin
istration has shown a willingness to experiment, to try something
new—and has succeeded.

Crothe feels Stanford, for a number of reasons, has more to
offer the Peace Corps than most schools. We agree, and we hope
that those interested in joining the Corps or just learning about it
will attend tonight’s program.
