# International Legal Studies Program Set Up at Stanford
## 
### ILENE STRELITZ 
An international legal studies
program, one of the most com
plete in the field, has been initiat
ed at the Stanford Law School.
The program has encompassed
three phases: expansion of appro
priate curriculum offerings, prep
aration of new teaching materials
and the conduct of research in the
field of international transactions
and international law.
Four courses now serve as the
curricular backing of the program
and are organized by Prof. Law
rence Ebb, chairman of the pro
gram, and Dean of the Law School
Carl Spaeth.
“LEGAL ASPECTS of U.S. For
eign Relations” is offered by
Spaeth, while Ebb teaches “Gov
ernment Regulation of Interna
tional Business Transactions.”
Tw o seminars complete the series
with “The Law of International
Transactions” and “Taxation of
Foreign Income.”
Spaeth’s course attempts to dis
tinguish the characteristics of in
ternational legal transactions as
opposed to municipal law. A ma
jor portion of the course deals
with American Constitutional law
as it relates to foreign affairs.
The exercise of governmental
regulatory power over interna
tional trade and investment serves
as the basis for study of Ebb’s
course.
PUBLISHED in December 1960
was a casebook by Professors
Bittker and Ebb, “Taxation of

Foreign Income.” The two-volume
set is being used this year at Stan
ford, New York University, Uni
versity of Minnesota, University
of Washington, Georgetown, Uni
versity of Miami, UCLA and Uni
versity of Virginia law schools.
Public law problems of India
offer the main theme of research
carried on as part of the program.
Highlighted by a trip to India by
Spaeth, an effort is being made
to help the Indians improve legal
education and thereby the com
petence of their Bar members.
Under a one year grant from the
South Asian Govei’nment Lawyer
Fellowship Program, lawyers
from India, Ceylon and Pakistan
study at the Stanford Law School.
RESEARCH into Indian public
law is to be carried out mainly by
Indians and scholars from other
countries under the impetus of
the Stanford program.
A research planning conference
was organized by the law school
in 1957 and resulted in the publi
cation of “Public Law Problems—
A Survey Report.” The book was
used as the basis for organization
of a conference of the New India
Law Institute in New Delhi to
which Stanford sent one of the
two attending Americans.
A report of the Joint Stanford-
Pennsylvania Law Conference of
1958, “Legal Problems of Interna
tional Investment and Trade in
South Asia” indicates a field of
research which, according to Ebb,
will see further concentration
from Stanford in future years.

South Asian Govei’nment Lawyer
Fellowship Program, lawyers
from India, Ceylon and Pakistan
study at the Stanford Law School.
RESEARCH into Indian public
law is to be carried out mainly by
Indians and scholars from other
countries under the impetus of
the Stanford program.
A research planning conference
was organized by the law school
in 1957 and resulted in the publi
cation of “Public Law Problems—
A Survey Report.” The book was
used as the basis for organization
of a conference of the New India
Law Institute in New Delhi to
which Stanford sent one of the
two attending Americans.
A report of the Joint Stanford-
Pennsylvania Law Conference of
1958, “Legal Problems of Interna
tional Investment and Trade in
South Asia” indicates a field of
research which, according to Ebb,
will see further concentration
from Stanford in future years.
An international legal studies
program, one of the most com
plete in the field, has been initiat
ed at the Stanford Law School.
The program has encompassed
three phases: expansion of appro
priate curriculum offerings, prep
aration of new teaching materials
and the conduct of research in the
field of international transactions
and international law.
Four courses now serve as the
curricular backing of the program
and are organized by Prof. Law
rence Ebb, chairman of the pro
gram, and Dean of the Law School
Carl Spaeth.
“LEGAL ASPECTS of U.S. For
eign Relations” is offered by
Spaeth, while Ebb teaches “Gov
ernment Regulation of Interna
tional Business Transactions.”
Tw o seminars complete the series
with “The Law of International
Transactions” and “Taxation of
Foreign Income.”
Spaeth’s course attempts to dis
tinguish the characteristics of in
ternational legal transactions as
opposed to municipal law. A ma
jor portion of the course deals
with American Constitutional law
as it relates to foreign affairs.
The exercise of governmental
regulatory power over interna
tional trade and investment serves
as the basis for study of Ebb’s
course.
PUBLISHED in December 1960
was a casebook by Professors
Bittker and Ebb, “Taxation of

Foreign Income.” The two-volume
set is being used this year at Stan
ford, New York University, Uni
versity of Minnesota, University
of Washington, Georgetown, Uni
versity of Miami, UCLA and Uni
versity of Virginia law schools.
Public law problems of India
offer the main theme of research
carried on as part of the program.
Highlighted by a trip to India by
Spaeth, an effort is being made
to help the Indians improve legal
education and thereby the com
petence of their Bar members.
