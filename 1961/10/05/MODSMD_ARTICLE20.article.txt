## Britain Joins the Common Market 
### PETER KNOX 
LONDON (UPD—The British
government, risking the future of
the Commonwealth and its own
political life, will open talks in
Paris next Tuesday to join the
European Common Market.
No one in authority here ex
pects a quick decision and months
of hard bargaining are anticipated
before Britain knows the fate of
her bid to link up with the six
nation trading group France,
Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland
and Luxembourg.
For Britain, which has always
stood aloof from the continent,
tremendous issues are at stake.
HER PARTNERS in the Com
monwealth have reacted strongly
against the Common Market idea.
They feel their economies will be
endangered by the loss of tradi
tional protected markets in Brit
ain.
Inside Britain vocal pro-empire
sections of the government’s own
Conservative Party are opposed
to the European tie-up.
The opposition Labor Party, al
though not firmly committed one
way or another, is suspicious of
the politics of some market mem
bers and swinging against it.
Finally the important farming
community is hostile—because the
heavy subsidies it now receives
would probably be lost, and many
trade unionists are suspicious of
European cheap labor.
BUT THE government has
shown no signs of weakening. It
believes the mass of the people
back it and that the Common
wealth will accept the idea.
Basically Britain’s conservative
government has two motives for
wanting to join the Common Mar
ket.
Politically Britain wants a voice
in shaping Europe’s future.
Government leaders feel that
the Common Market group will
exercise an increasingly influen
tial role in world affairs, and they
want to share in it.
ALTHOUGH Britain only does
14 per cent of her overseas trade
at present with the Common Mar
ket countries against 40 per cent

with the Commonwealth, it is the
economic argument for the tie-up
that it attracting most attention.
The Common Market is a bloc
of 170 million people, which is
already turning out two and a
half times as many goods as Brit
tain and striking a higher rate of
industrial growth.
Those who favor Britain’s entry

say that because the Common
Market is a vigorously expanding
area, this country cannot afford
to stay out.

Inside Britain vocal pro-empire
sections of the government’s own
Conservative Party are opposed
to the European tie-up.
The opposition Labor Party, al
though not firmly committed one
way or another, is suspicious of
the politics of some market mem
bers and swinging against it.
Finally the important farming
community is hostile—because the
heavy subsidies it now receives
would probably be lost, and many
trade unionists are suspicious of
European cheap labor.
BUT THE government has
shown no signs of weakening. It
believes the mass of the people
back it and that the Common
wealth will accept the idea.
Basically Britain’s conservative
government has two motives for
wanting to join the Common Mar
ket.
Politically Britain wants a voice
in shaping Europe’s future.
Government leaders feel that
the Common Market group will
exercise an increasingly influen
tial role in world affairs, and they
want to share in it.
ALTHOUGH Britain only does
14 per cent of her overseas trade
at present with the Common Mar
ket countries against 40 per cent

with the Commonwealth, it is the
economic argument for the tie-up
that it attracting most attention.
The Common Market is a bloc
of 170 million people, which is
already turning out two and a
half times as many goods as Brit
tain and striking a higher rate of
industrial growth.
Those who favor Britain’s entry

say that because the Common
Market is a vigorously expanding
area, this country cannot afford
to stay out.
LONDON (UPD—The British
government, risking the future of
the Commonwealth and its own
political life, will open talks in
Paris next Tuesday to join the
European Common Market.
No one in authority here ex
pects a quick decision and months
of hard bargaining are anticipated
before Britain knows the fate of
her bid to link up with the six
nation trading group France,
Germany, Italy, Belgium, Holland
and Luxembourg.
For Britain, which has always
stood aloof from the continent,
tremendous issues are at stake.
HER PARTNERS in the Com
monwealth have reacted strongly
against the Common Market idea.
They feel their economies will be
endangered by the loss of tradi
tional protected markets in Brit
ain.
