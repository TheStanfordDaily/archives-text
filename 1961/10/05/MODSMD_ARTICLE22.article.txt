# Ford Blanks Reds

### OSCAR FRALEY 
NEW YORK (UPI) Stubby
Whitey Ford’s record-setting
pitching and the most thunderous
home run bats in baseball history
swept the New York Yankees to
a 2-0 triumph over the Cincinnati
Reds in the opening game of the
World Series yesterday.
The bludgeons which bashed an
all-time high of 210 home runs this
year roared the Yankee victory
tune when Elston Howard clipped
a fourth-inning clout into the
lower right field stands and Moose
Skowron lofted a lowering shot
into the left-field stands in the
sixth inning.
FORI), THE ice water blond
with an eye on the record books,
took care of the Rods with a two
hit shutout- his third consecutive
scoreless effort in World Series
play and his unprecedented eighth
win in the classic.
The Yankees did it without ail
ing Mickey Mantle as they hung
the defeat on handsome young
Jim O’Toole, although he hand
cuffed home run king Roger Mar
is before retiring for a pinch-hit
ter after giving up six hits and
two runs in seven innings.
It was a heart-breaking defeat
for the Reds, whoso scorned de
fense contributed two sparking
plays; but on this chill gray day
they simply were unable to match
that Yankee power and the south
paw slants of the chunky Ford
before a crowd of 62,397 fans.
AND IT WAS Ford’s day all the j
way, even the weather conspiring
to help the heat-hating 32-year-old
who compiled his greatest record
this season with 25 victories. For
when it was over Whitey had:
—Become the first man to win
eight Series games, leaving behind
him former Yankee greats Red
Ruffing and Allie Reynolds each
with seven.
—Run his record of all-time
Series strikeouts to 69 by fanning
six of the Reds.
—ln pitching his third consecu
tive Series shutout, stood only
two and two-thirds innings aw'ay
from the all-time classic mark set 1
by Babe Ruth in 1916 and 1918
when he was a pitcher with the
Boston Red Sox.
HE HAD THEM in his pocket
all the way, the futilely swinging
Reds getting only three balls out
of the infield and getting only one
of their three base runners to sec
ond base.
On the other hand the tight-lip
ped O’Toole, who admitted that he
would “have butterflies” until
after he got his first hitter out,
was in an immediate jam as he
went to the mound. Bobby Rich
ardson greeted him with a single
to left and Tony Kubek walked on |
four straight pitches.
Then up came Maris, who hit
more home runs in one season |
than any man in history. But j
O'Toole met the challenge "by get- j
ting him to pop up and the run- j
ners held again when Elston How-!
ard flied to short center. O’Toole
faltered briefly as he walked
Moose Skowron to fill the bases
but then got Yogi Berra, appear
ing in his record 69th game, to
pop up on a breathless 3-and-2
pitch.
THE HANDSOME ‘O’TooIe was
having trouble with his curve and
when he went primarily to his
fast ball it caught up to him in
the fourth inning. For those |
muted Yankee bats started to j
thunder when Howard arched his
fifth World Series home run into
the lower right field stands.
While O’Toole was pitching his
heart out, and that rather cheap I
Howard homer in the fourth |
looked like it was going to be j
enough, Skowron gave the Yan
kees a cushion in the sixth when
with one away he sent his shot
soaring high into the lower left
field stands.
That was the ball game, al
though Kasko’s brilliant stab on
Ford’s line drive in the fourth and
that crisp double play by the Reds
in the third shouted their defiance
of the talk that they were a bunch
of defensive butchers.
