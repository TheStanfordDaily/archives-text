### RON RAPOFORT 
Daily reporter Ron Rapoport
will accompany the football team
to East Lansing, Mich., this week
end. Read his reports in the Daily
tomorrow and Monday.

Possesing a taste of triumph
and a glimpse of glory, Stanford’s
undefeated football team will fear
lessly board an eastbound plane
this morning and head for the
home of its roughest competitor
this or any other year, Michigan
State.
The scene of the Saturday con
test is East Lansing, Mich., a
quaint Middle Western (own,
whose major claim to fame is the
remnants of a tiny college of ag
riculture and mines. These re
mains now take the form of vari
ous schools of Veterinary Medi
cine, Home Economics, Hotel and
Restaurant Management, etc.
But it is football that has
brought Michigan State most of
its public attention in the last
several years and, although it
has been relatively quiet on the
Spartan gridiron front recently,
there are signs that things may
once again be picking up.
For instance, Stanford assistant
coach Andy Everest, who scouted
State in a 20-0 win over Wisconsin
last week, flatly states that Michi
gan State is the best college foot
ball team he has ever seen.
And depending on which wire
service you patronize, the Spar
tans are either (he country’s
fourth best or its sixth best. The
Indians are 14 jo -point underdogs
and that’s the end of that.
Duffy Daugherty’s squad is

loaded at every position except
quarterback, but he hardly needs
one. Last week Michigan State
rolled up 330 yards, all on the
ground.
Fullback Ron Hatcher, who led
the team in rushing last year with
361 yards and 6.1 per carry, is ex
pected to lead the ground attack.
Junior halfback George Saimes,
who scored twice last week, will
be around as well.
Carl Charon, a two-letter win
ner at fullback, was moved to
left-half this year because the
fullback supply was considered
ample. Gary Ballman, second in
ground-gaining last year, will also
go at halfback.
If the Spartan line is anywhere
near as good as it is big, it could
probably play for (ho Baltimore
Colts. Dave Behrman, a 250-pound
junior, starts at right tackle. Jim
Bobbitt, another 250-pounder, is
at left tackle.
The center, Dave Manders,
checks in at 220, while the right
guard, Ed Budde, weighs 240. The
baby of the line is left guard,
George Azar, a mere 190. The
ends aren’t as big, just fast,
Strangely enough, Daugherty
seemed to have little use for his
first string backfield last week
against Wisconsin. Hatcher, for
instance, was in only long enough
to score a touchdown, while Ball
man barely got his uniform dirty.
Maybe Duffy was saving them
for his encounter with the West
Coast’s only major unbeaten col
lege team . . . Stanford.
