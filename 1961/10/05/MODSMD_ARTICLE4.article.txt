# Kennedy-Gromyko Set Washington Conference
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD-Presi
dent Kennedy will meet Friday
with Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko in a crucial White
House conference that may deter
mine whether actual negotiations
on Berlin will be held.
Officials said they expected the
President to give Gromyko a mes
sage for Soviet Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev. It would make cer
tain that Khrushchev fully under
stands this country’s determina
tion to defend the West's vital in
terests in Berlin.
THE MEETING was announced
by the White House Wednesday.
It was scheduled as a result of
somewhat encouraging progress
made in three discussions in New

York last week between Gromyko
and Secretary of State Dean
Rusk. However, U.S. officials cau
tioned against undue optimism.
The Kennedy - Gromyko talk
should help to decide whether
there is any chance of moving
current “exploratory” discussions
on the Berlin crisis into the ac
tual negotiation stage sometime
later this year.
The President will meet with
Gromyko at 5 p.m. EDT Friday.
Llewellyn Thompson, U.S. ambas
sador to Russia! will arrive here
Friday night from Moscow, but
too late to attend the conference.
But lie will be available for later
consultations within the govern
ment.
