# Freshmen Seek Funds For Rally
## 
### 
“Practically like being at
the Michigan game,” Head
Yell Leader Tim Laddish said
of the rally to be held at
Frost Amphitheater at 10:30
Saturday morning.
This unusual rally, origi
nated and sponsored by the
freshman class, will be held
at the same time as the Stan
ford football team will hope
fully be beating Michigan.
Highlighting the event will
be three phone calls to the
team while they are in the
Michigan locker room. Before
the game and at half time,
the team will hear the stu
dents’ yells by means of an
amplification system in the
locker room.
After the game the team
will hear the students singing
the Stanford Hymn, and the
crowd at Frost will hear com
ments by Coach Jack Curtice
in reply.
To raise money for these
morale-building calls, the
freshman class has placed a
box in the street by the cellar
today labeled “Support Your
Team.” Contributions will pay
for the calls, and if any sur
plus money is left, the fresh
men plan to use it toward
phoning yells to the team
while they are in Seattle.
Both students and public
are invited to eat their
lunches at the amphitheater
while listening to the game
which will be broadcast across
the theater.
Pom pon girls, yell leaders
and the band will be there to
lead yells and songs, and half
time entertainment will in
clude two freshman skits.
Freshmen can pick up box
lunches at the dining room of
their dorms from 9:30 a.m. to
12:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The event was spontaneous
ly organized by the freshmen
with no aid from the rally
committee as a gesture of en
thusiastic response both to
becoming part of the Stan
ford family and to the team’s
excellent showing in its past
two games.
Representatives of the Class
of ’65 hope the rest of the
student body will join in their
enthusiasm by contributing
to the phone fund and by com
ing to the rally.

dents’ yells by means of an
amplification system in the
locker room.
After the game the team
will hear the students singing
the Stanford Hymn, and the
crowd at Frost will hear com
ments by Coach Jack Curtice
in reply.
To raise money for these
morale-building calls, the
freshman class has placed a
box in the street by the cellar
today labeled “Support Your
Team.” Contributions will pay
for the calls, and if any sur
plus money is left, the fresh
men plan to use it toward
phoning yells to the team
while they are in Seattle.
Both students and public
are invited to eat their
lunches at the amphitheater
while listening to the game
which will be broadcast across
the theater.
Pom pon girls, yell leaders
and the band will be there to
lead yells and songs, and half
time entertainment will in
clude two freshman skits.
Freshmen can pick up box
lunches at the dining room of
their dorms from 9:30 a.m. to
12:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The event was spontaneous
ly organized by the freshmen
with no aid from the rally
committee as a gesture of en
thusiastic response both to
becoming part of the Stan
ford family and to the team’s
excellent showing in its past
two games.
Representatives of the Class
of ’65 hope the rest of the
student body will join in their
enthusiasm by contributing
to the phone fund and by com
ing to the rally.
