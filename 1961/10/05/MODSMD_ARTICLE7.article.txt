# Alleged Emissary Refutes Claim of Nixon-Knight 'Fix’
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (UPI)— The man identified yesterday by
Goodwin J. Knight as an agent of Richard M. Nixon said he told
the former governor lie “undoubtedly” could have any state job if
he did not run for governor in 1962.
But financier J. Howard Edgerton, while confirming he talked

■by telephone with Knight on Sept.
8, flatly denied he acted as an
emissary of Nixon, or at any time
offered a deal to get Knight out
of the running.
Nixon also denied the charge
and said Knight had "humiliated”
himself.
“I made one last inquiry on my
own initiative to avoid just the
kind of fight between Nixon and
Knight that is happening now,”
said Edgerton. “Frankly I was
more concerned for the party than
for either of the two men.
“KNIGHT KNEW what I was
talking about,” said Edgerton.
“We've been political cronies for
a long while. No one, Nixon or
anyone else, used me as a repre
sentative to call Knight.”
“We were down to the one-yard
line,” Edgerton said, “with it
starling to look like Nixon would
run. It was my own personal sur
mise that if Knight did not run,
he could have any state job. I
may have mentioned the Supreme
Court; I don’t remember.”
In a lengthy letter to “Dear
Goodie,” Edgerton said “it has
really never made much differ
ence to me whether you or Nixon
ran in the primary, provided you
did not run against each other.”
He said he supported neither can
didate at this time.
KNIGHT TOLD a news confer
ence Edgerton offered him—in a
telephone call Sept. B—any job in
the state “including chief justice
of the Supreme Court” if he
stayed out of the 1962 race.
“Nixon’s offer is simply an at
tempt on his part to do what he
has done in every other cam
paign,” said Knight, “to run with
out any Republican opposiiton.”
But Edgerton disclosed the con
tents of a lengthy letter he sent
Knight yesterday, in which he
said he never acted as emissary
for Nixon.
“AT NO TIME up to the present
moment have I ever asked you
not to run for the governorship,”
he said in giving his version of
the much-publicized telephone
call.
