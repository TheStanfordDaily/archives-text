# 'UAW Strike May Last Two Weeks'—Ford VP
## 
### 
DETROIT (UPll—The United
Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co.
Wednesday dashed all hopes for
a settlement of the strike of
120.000 UAW members against the
nation’s second largest car maker
before next week.
The company and union, after
meeting briefly Wednesday morn
ing and again Wednesday after
noon, decided to adjourn further
talks on a national contract until
Friday.
THEY WILL concentrate be
tween now and then on ironing
out local—as opposed to national
—contract differences, and they
thus will not even get back to dis
cussing national contract issues
until the end of this work week.
And even in the event a full
settlement of all issues both na
tional and local was reached dur
ing the weekend, the company

could not return to production be
fore next week, a Ford spokesman
said.
Earlier, Ford Vice President
Malcolm L. Denise charged the
union had wasted valuable time
before Tuesday’s strike deadline
in trying to get Ford to give it
more than the union got at Gen
eral Motors—to get some “frost
ing on the cake,” as Denise put it.
THE UNION called its 120,000
hourly-paid Ford workers off the
job at 88 plants across the nation
at 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday in the
auto industry’s second major
strike in less than a month.
Denise said the first national
strike against Ford in 20 years
“might very well” continue for
two or three weeks “but I would
hope we can finish it sooner.”
He said “I am in complete dis
agreement” with a claim by UAW
President Walter P. Reuther that
time simply ran out on negotia
tions.
“THERE was plenty of time,”
Denise said. “The union didn’t get
off the frosting on the cake kick
until 8:30 a.m. Tuesday.”
Negotiations resumed Wednes
day after a 24-hour recess with the
government urging both sides to
work toward a quick settlement.
But talks on a national contract
were adjourned Wednesday after
noon until 2 p.m. Friday. The
company and union said the lime
until then would be spent review
ing local issues.
LOCAL plant-level contract is
sues are still to be ironed out at
47 of Ford’s 88 bargaining units,
in addition to the national con
tract.
Labor Secretary Arthur Gold
berg appealed to the company and
the union to exert “every effort”
to reach a speedy settlement.
The strike, which Ford said is
costing hourly-paid woi’kers $2.6
million a day in lost wages, came
only eight days after strike action
ended at General Motors Corp.

Wednesday dashed all hopes for
a settlement of the strike of
120.000 UAW members against the
nation’s second largest car maker
before next week.
The company and union, after
meeting briefly Wednesday morn
ing and again Wednesday after
noon, decided to adjourn further
talks on a national contract until
Friday.
THEY WILL concentrate be
tween now and then on ironing
out local—as opposed to national
—contract differences, and they
thus will not even get back to dis
cussing national contract issues
until the end of this work week.
And even in the event a full
settlement of all issues both na
tional and local was reached dur
ing the weekend, the company

could not return to production be
fore next week, a Ford spokesman
said.
Earlier, Ford Vice President
Malcolm L. Denise charged the
union had wasted valuable time
before Tuesday’s strike deadline
in trying to get Ford to give it
more than the union got at Gen
eral Motors—to get some “frost
ing on the cake,” as Denise put it.
THE UNION called its 120,000
hourly-paid Ford workers off the
job at 88 plants across the nation
at 11 a.m. EDT Tuesday in the
auto industry’s second major
strike in less than a month.
Denise said the first national
strike against Ford in 20 years
“might very well” continue for
two or three weeks “but I would
hope we can finish it sooner.”
He said “I am in complete dis
agreement” with a claim by UAW
President Walter P. Reuther that
time simply ran out on negotia
tions.
“THERE was plenty of time,”
Denise said. “The union didn’t get
off the frosting on the cake kick
until 8:30 a.m. Tuesday.”
Negotiations resumed Wednes
day after a 24-hour recess with the
government urging both sides to
work toward a quick settlement.
