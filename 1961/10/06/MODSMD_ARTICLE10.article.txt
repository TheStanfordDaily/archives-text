## On European Union 
### 
In Great Britain as well as in
West Germany a great debate is
going on which will load to a mo
mentous decision. Both debates
are about the future.
The British debate arose out of
the decision of the government to
apply for membership in the Com
mon Market of the six West Eu
ropean continental countries. The
issue before the British is whether
they can enter the Common Mar
ket on terms which will not cause
a more or less rapid dissolution
of the Commonwealth.
The West German debate arises
out of the fact that the old dual
and contradictory formula of the
Adenauer-Dulles era—integration
with Western Europe combined

with reunification with East Ger
many—has collapsed.
THESE TWO parallel crises are
related in that for both countries
the issue is whether to give para
mount priority to economic and
political union with Western Eu
rope. For Britain the price of uni
ty may be the attenuation of the
ties which bind it to Canada, Au
stralia, New Zealand and to many
of the newer dominions.

In West Germany the price of
unity with Western Europe is the
recognition, though tacit and de
facto, that there are two German
states and that they will have to
negotiate as states for some
closer union.

It is not an accident, and it is
not a mere coincidence, that these
two crises have come at the same
time. Europe, west of the Iron
Curtain, is now engaged in ad
justing itself to the great historic
consequences of the second World
War. For Germany the conse
quences have been the dismem
berment of the Eastern provinces
and the partition of the remainder.
FOR GREAT Britain the conse
quence was the liquidation of the
old empire and the loss of the
economic and military capacity to
play the part of a world power of
the first rank. As as result, both
Great Britain and West Germany
have turned to union with West
ern Europe. In that union they
hope to find not only their econ
omic salvation but to play a lead
ing part in a new political entity
capable eventually of exercising
equal influence with the super
powers.

This union in Western Europe,
which Great Britain may now
join, has from its founding in
1951 rested on the premise that
West Germany must be reconciled
with France, and that a new po
litical community must be created
which controls German sovereign
ty and recognizes tacitly that the
reunification of Germany is im
possible.
The West European union is in
spired by a vision of great pros
perity in a very rich market and
of political influence based on
the combined power of the old and
experienced states of Western Eu
rope.

THIS VISION is being realized,
and it is the true answer to the
pressure of Communist expansion
in Europe. The rising prosperity
of Western Europe, if combined
with a far sighted overall central
European arrangement, will be
an enormous attraction and influ
ence in Eastern Europe.
Although Ihe United States fa
vors this development as being in
the best interests of Europe and
of mankind, it is the fact, of
course, that we are outside the
European community. Its tariff
wall and perhaps its monetary
policies will affect American in
terests. There are problems here.
BUT considering our own size
and our enormous potential, we
have no reason to exaggerate and
dramatize these problems. What
we should give great thought to
is how not only we but Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, the Latin
American Republics, and other
states outside the Communist or
bit can make a satisfactory ad
justment to the very big and very
new fact which will exist if Brit
ain joins the Common Market.

We shall be particularly con
cerned with the interests of the
American Republics in this hemi
sphere and with the interest of
Japan, Australia, New Zealand
and the Philippines in the West
ern Pacific.

It may be that in both regions
the clue to policy will be the foun
dation of economic and political
communities which can represent
the individual member nations in
their dealings with the outer
world.

In Great Britain as well as in
West Germany a great debate is
going on which will load to a mo
mentous decision. Both debates
are about the future.
The British debate arose out of
the decision of the government to
apply for membership in the Com
mon Market of the six West Eu
ropean continental countries. The
issue before the British is whether
they can enter the Common Mar
ket on terms which will not cause
a more or less rapid dissolution
of the Commonwealth.
The West German debate arises
out of the fact that the old dual
and contradictory formula of the
Adenauer-Dulles era—integration
with Western Europe combined

with reunification with East Ger
many—has collapsed.
THESE TWO parallel crises are
related in that for both countries
the issue is whether to give para
mount priority to economic and
political union with Western Eu
rope. For Britain the price of uni
ty may be the attenuation of the
ties which bind it to Canada, Au
stralia, New Zealand and to many
of the newer dominions.

In West Germany the price of
unity with Western Europe is the
recognition, though tacit and de
facto, that there are two German
states and that they will have to
negotiate as states for some
closer union.

It is not an accident, and it is
not a mere coincidence, that these
two crises have come at the same
time. Europe, west of the Iron
Curtain, is now engaged in ad
justing itself to the great historic
consequences of the second World
War. For Germany the conse
quences have been the dismem
berment of the Eastern provinces
and the partition of the remainder.
FOR GREAT Britain the conse
quence was the liquidation of the
old empire and the loss of the
economic and military capacity to
play the part of a world power of
the first rank. As as result, both
Great Britain and West Germany
have turned to union with West
ern Europe. In that union they
hope to find not only their econ
omic salvation but to play a lead
ing part in a new political entity
capable eventually of exercising
equal influence with the super
powers.

This union in Western Europe,
which Great Britain may now
join, has from its founding in
1951 rested on the premise that
West Germany must be reconciled
with France, and that a new po
litical community must be created
which controls German sovereign
ty and recognizes tacitly that the
reunification of Germany is im
possible.
The West European union is in
spired by a vision of great pros
perity in a very rich market and
of political influence based on
the combined power of the old and
experienced states of Western Eu
rope.

THIS VISION is being realized,
and it is the true answer to the
pressure of Communist expansion
in Europe. The rising prosperity
of Western Europe, if combined
with a far sighted overall central
European arrangement, will be
an enormous attraction and influ
ence in Eastern Europe.
Although Ihe United States fa
vors this development as being in
the best interests of Europe and
of mankind, it is the fact, of
course, that we are outside the
European community. Its tariff
wall and perhaps its monetary
policies will affect American in
terests. There are problems here.
BUT considering our own size
and our enormous potential, we
have no reason to exaggerate and
dramatize these problems. What
we should give great thought to

reunification of Germany is im
possible.
The West European union is in
spired by a vision of great pros
perity in a very rich market and
of political influence based on
the combined power of the old and
experienced states of Western Eu
rope.

THIS VISION is being realized,
and it is the true answer to the
pressure of Communist expansion
in Europe. The rising prosperity
of Western Europe, if combined
with a far sighted overall central
European arrangement, will be
an enormous attraction and influ
ence in Eastern Europe.
Although Ihe United States fa
vors this development as being in
the best interests of Europe and
of mankind, it is the fact, of
course, that we are outside the
European community. Its tariff
wall and perhaps its monetary
policies will affect American in
terests. There are problems here.
BUT considering our own size
and our enormous potential, we
have no reason to exaggerate and
dramatize these problems. What
we should give great thought to
is how not only we but Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, the Latin
American Republics, and other
states outside the Communist or
bit can make a satisfactory ad
justment to the very big and very
new fact which will exist if Brit
ain joins the Common Market.

We shall be particularly con
cerned with the interests of the
American Republics in this hemi
sphere and with the interest of
Japan, Australia, New Zealand
and the Philippines in the West
ern Pacific.

It may be that in both regions
the clue to policy will be the foun
dation of economic and political
communities which can represent
the individual member nations in
their dealings with the outer
world.
