Editor, The Daily:
Since the issue of Red China’s
admission to the U.N. has been a
. . . topic of discussion in The
Daily, I would like to propose the
logical, though improbable, solu
tion to the problem.
It seems apparent that Red
China will eventually be seated
in the U.N. As conditions . . . ex
ist this would be highly unfavor
able to the West for several rea
sons:

1.) Nationalist China would lose
its seat; 2.) Red China would get
China’s permanent seat on the Se
curity Council; 3.) Red China
could claim Formosa as a part of
China (which Formosa . . . insists
she is).

It is illogical to argue that Red
China should not be seated on
moral grounds, since many of the
... members of the U.N. are guilty
on the same counts charged
against Red China; and Red China
can claim moral immunity as long
as she is excluded.
How ... is the dilemma to be
solved? First, the U.S. should pres
sure Chiang Kai-shek into resign
ing China’s permanent seat on the
Security Council. ..

China’s 1 seat could be given to a
powerful neutral—lndia. After re
signing .China’s permanent seat
on the Security Council, Nation
alist China would declare itself
the Republic of Formosa and re
linquish all claims to the main
land (and hence negate Red Chi
na’s claim to Formosa). This move
would be popular with the For
mosans who resent Chiang’s mili
taristic dictatorship.
Thus Red China would join the
U.N. without a seat on the Securi
ty Council; Formosa would con
tinue to be represented in the Gen
eral Assembly and would be le
gally safe from Communist
claims.

Needless to say, I never expect
this plan to capitalize. Anachron
istic congressmen will continue to
shout obsolete shibboleths while
our foreign policy remains immo
bile. Instead, when Red China is
admitted, we will be backed to the
wall and the Communists will
. . . again have the initiative ... I
can only hope that the American
public will rally in time behind a
far-sighted foreign policy.
