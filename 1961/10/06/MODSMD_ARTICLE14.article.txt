## 
### 
DETROIT (UPl)—Strike bound
Ford Motor Co. and the United
Auto Workers Union yesterday
worked on local plant contract
problems, leaving until today the
unresolved national issues which
triggered the first company-wide
walkout against Ford in 20 years.
Mike Cummins, in charge of the
Ford labor relations department,
and Ken Bannon, UAW vice presi
dent, both reported progress and
expressed hope for a quick end to
the strike by 120,000 Ford work
ers.

Local issues are still unsettled
at 47 of Ford’s 88 plants across
the country.
Cummins said, “I’m very hope
ful. Iha/ea feeling we’re making
progress at some of these plants.
Two or three are in agreement
but have not signed, and we have
several where there are just one
or two items holding us apart.’’
