# STAFF OPINION
## U.S. Communists Are Not 'Loyal Americans' 
### BOSS HERMANN 
The Stanford Daily, in its edi
torial of Oct. 2, announced that it
doesn’t mind being allied with
Communists in efforts to maintain
civil liberties. To quote from that
editorial, “If a Communist or
Nazi or left-handed cricket player
is willing to help us defend our
civil liberties, we are prepared to
accept that help.”
The assumption behind this
statement is that Communists are
loyal Americans, just like Repub
licans or Democrats, who are sin
cerely concerned about the slate
of civil liberties in the United
States.

This assumption ignores com
pletely (1) that the Communist
organization is not a loyal politi
cal party hut a conspiratorial
force directed from the Soviet
Union and (2) that Communists
rather than their opponents are
the chief threat to American civil
liberties.
IN ORDER to demonstrate the
“sincerity” with which the Com
munists promote such noble
causes as civil liberties and social
justice, I relate the following
story.
Prior to 1954, Carl and Anne
Braden were known simply as cru
saders for social justice. Carl, who
worked as a copyreader on the
desk of the Louisville Courier-
Journal, circulated peace peti
tions, helped direct labor strikes,
and promoted integration in his
spare time.
In the spring of 1954, the Bra
dens bought a moderately expen
sive ranch-style home in a re
stricted, all-white suburb of Louis
ville and transfered the title to
Andrew Wade, a Negro electrical
contractor.

THIS WAS, indeed, a radical ac
tion to be taken in a city like
Louisville where only slow social
progress was being made, but at
this point the Bradens could be
viewed merely as sincere, but
overzealous, reformers.
But the matter did not end here.
White extremists helped out by
burning a cross, firing shots at
the Wade home, and shouting
threats from passing cars.
Instead of requesting police pro
tection, the Bradens took the situ
ation into their own hands,
formed the “Wade Defense Com
mittee,” and stationed armed
members to guard the house. This
action, in turn, aroused further
resentment in the community.

JUST WHEN it appeared, how
ever, that the commotion was sub
siding, a bomb ripped through the
Wade home.

The Louisville grand jury inves
tigated and determined from the
pattern of destruction that the
bomb had been planted inside the
house. The jury reported, “It
would have been impossible for
the explosive to have been placed
under the house by anyone from
the outside.

“It is our opinion that the
charge was placed and discharged
by someone having access to the
house.”
THE members of the defense
committee, including the Bradens,
were the first to come under sus
picion. Police, searching their
house, came up with box after box
of Communist literature, some of
it explaining to party members
how to incite racial violence.
Carl Braden was indicted for
conspiring in the bombing and ad
vocating sedition, in this case the
willful attempt to stir up racial
violence. He was tried and con
victed on the second charge and
sentenced to 15 years in prison.

A witness at his trial testified
that the Bradens had recruited
her into the Communist Party.
That same testimony was given
before the Senate Internal Securi
ty Subcommittee on Judiciary
during its Memphis hearings in
1957.
AFTER SIX months in jail,

Braden was ordered released by
the Kentucky Court of Appeals
which followed a Supreme Court
ruling that states do not have ju
risdiction in sedition cases.
The effects of the Bradens’ ac
tions were three-fold. They (1)
supplied the Soviet Union with po
tent propaganda to be used to de
grade the world image of the
United States, (2) promoted ani
mosity and tension between the
races, which ordinarily does not
exist, and (3) set back perhaps for
several years the slow course of
social progress in Louisville,
something for which they were
purportedly working.

before the Senate Internal Securi
ty Subcommittee on Judiciary
during its Memphis hearings in
1957.
AFTER SIX months in jail,

Braden was ordered released by
the Kentucky Court of Appeals
which followed a Supreme Court
ruling that states do not have ju
risdiction in sedition cases.
The effects of the Bradens’ ac
tions were three-fold. They (1)
supplied the Soviet Union with po
tent propaganda to be used to de
grade the world image of the
United States, (2) promoted ani
mosity and tension between the
races, which ordinarily does not
exist, and (3) set back perhaps for
several years the slow course of
social progress in Louisville,
something for which they were
purportedly working.
The Stanford Daily, in its edi
torial of Oct. 2, announced that it
doesn’t mind being allied with
Communists in efforts to maintain
civil liberties. To quote from that
editorial, “If a Communist or
Nazi or left-handed cricket player
is willing to help us defend our
civil liberties, we are prepared to
accept that help.”
The assumption behind this
statement is that Communists are
loyal Americans, just like Repub
licans or Democrats, who are sin
cerely concerned about the slate
of civil liberties in the United
States.

This assumption ignores com
pletely (1) that the Communist
organization is not a loyal politi
cal party hut a conspiratorial
force directed from the Soviet
Union and (2) that Communists
rather than their opponents are
the chief threat to American civil
liberties.
IN ORDER to demonstrate the
“sincerity” with which the Com
munists promote such noble
causes as civil liberties and social
justice, I relate the following
story.
Prior to 1954, Carl and Anne
Braden were known simply as cru
saders for social justice. Carl, who
worked as a copyreader on the
desk of the Louisville Courier-
Journal, circulated peace peti
tions, helped direct labor strikes,
and promoted integration in his
spare time.
In the spring of 1954, the Bra
dens bought a moderately expen
sive ranch-style home in a re
stricted, all-white suburb of Louis
ville and transfered the title to
Andrew Wade, a Negro electrical
contractor.

THIS WAS, indeed, a radical ac
tion to be taken in a city like
Louisville where only slow social
progress was being made, but at
this point the Bradens could be
viewed merely as sincere, but
overzealous, reformers.
But the matter did not end here.
White extremists helped out by
burning a cross, firing shots at
the Wade home, and shouting
threats from passing cars.
Instead of requesting police pro
tection, the Bradens took the situ
ation into their own hands,
formed the “Wade Defense Com
mittee,” and stationed armed
members to guard the house. This
action, in turn, aroused further
resentment in the community.

JUST WHEN it appeared, how
ever, that the commotion was sub
siding, a bomb ripped through the
Wade home.

The Louisville grand jury inves
tigated and determined from the
pattern of destruction that the
bomb had been planted inside the
house. The jury reported, “It
would have been impossible for
the explosive to have been placed
under the house by anyone from
the outside.

“It is our opinion that the
charge was placed and discharged
by someone having access to the
house.”
THE members of the defense
committee, including the Bradens,
were the first to come under sus
picion. Police, searching their
house, came up with box after box
of Communist literature, some of
it explaining to party members
how to incite racial violence.
Carl Braden was indicted for
conspiring in the bombing and ad
vocating sedition, in this case the
willful attempt to stir up racial
violence. He was tried and con
victed on the second charge and
sentenced to 15 years in prison.

A witness at his trial testified
that the Bradens had recruited
her into the Communist Party.
That same testimony was given
before the Senate Internal Securi

charge was placed and discharged
by someone having access to the
house.”
THE members of the defense
committee, including the Bradens,
were the first to come under sus
picion. Police, searching their
house, came up with box after box
of Communist literature, some of
it explaining to party members
how to incite racial violence.
Carl Braden was indicted for
conspiring in the bombing and ad
vocating sedition, in this case the
willful attempt to stir up racial
violence. He was tried and con
victed on the second charge and
sentenced to 15 years in prison.

A witness at his trial testified
that the Bradens had recruited
her into the Communist Party.
That same testimony was given
before the Senate Internal Securi
ty Subcommittee on Judiciary
during its Memphis hearings in
1957.
AFTER SIX months in jail,

Braden was ordered released by
the Kentucky Court of Appeals
which followed a Supreme Court
ruling that states do not have ju
risdiction in sedition cases.
The effects of the Bradens’ ac
tions were three-fold. They (1)
supplied the Soviet Union with po
tent propaganda to be used to de
grade the world image of the
United States, (2) promoted ani
mosity and tension between the
races, which ordinarily does not
exist, and (3) set back perhaps for
several years the slow course of
social progress in Louisville,
something for which they were
purportedly working.
