SUNNYVALE (UPD—-The city
of Sunnyvale started a study yes
terday on how to keep Commun
ists out of civic buildings, from
filing for election or holding of
fice.
Councilman C. Robert Brown
said successful candidates must
take the usual oath of office, but
the council now seeks away to
prevent Communist party mem
bers from filing in the first place.
The city attorney was asked to
find a legal way to accomplish the
purpose.
Brown, at the same time, said
he did not want to see any book
in the public library giving the
Russian viewpoint.
“That,” Brown said, “is like
having books favoring robbery
and adultery.”
The council recommended the
city may purchase four anti-Com
munist books for the library. The
titles, “Masters of Deceit,” by J.
Edgar Hoover; “You Can Trust
the Communists,” a satire by Fred
Schwarz; “The Naked Commun
ists,” by W. C. Skousen, and “An
American with Guts,” by Edward
Edell.
