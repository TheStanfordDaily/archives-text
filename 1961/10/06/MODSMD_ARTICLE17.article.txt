# Burmese May Get Dag's Job

### 
UNITED NATIONS (UPD
The bandwagon appeared to be
rolling last night for U Thant of
Burma to become acting secre
tary general of the United Nations
even though the United States
withheld approval of a compli
cated small-power plan to fill the
post.
General Assembly President
Mongi Slim of Tunisia and past
president Frederick H. Boland of
Ireland were still much in the
running, but delegates from all
areas talked mainly of reported
Russian support for the mild-man
nered Burmese ambassador.
Russia told Thant two weeks
ago that the Soviet Union found
him personally acceptable.
U.S. sources authoritatively de
nied agreement on the plan or a
candidate.
“The United States and the So
viet Union have not reached agree
ment on any facet of this prob
lem,” a delegation spokesman
said. “The situation is fluid. No
agreement has been reached at
all.”

Individual members of an eight
power group of uncommitted
countries talked with Russian dip
lomats yesterday on the plan they
all but completed Wednesday.
Hope was expressed for Russian
agreement on the proposal next
week.

Another boost for Thant came
from Arab leaders who said they
would not oppose him for the in
terim post even though they dis
approved of Burma’s policy on
Israel.
