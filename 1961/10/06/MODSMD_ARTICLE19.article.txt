Editor, The Daily:
It grieves me to differ with Ron
ald B. Swenson’s letter in Wednes
day’s Daily, especially since it is
so difficult to figure out what
that letter means.

Even though Mr. Swenson does
not appear to approve of Gold
water’s plans for Cuba, his own
idea of giving our “southern
neighbor” a “switching out in the
tool shed,” seems to present cer
tain technical problems. Mr. Swen
son criticizes the editor for having
no answer of his own; but with
what does Mr. Swenson propose
to spank Cuba, presuming that a
spanking is really what Cuba
needs ?

Mr. Swenson also says that his
“vision is not so clogged by ide
ologies” that he cannot see that
“Communists, Nazis, or left-hand
ed writers” are determined ulti
mately to destroy him and his
civil liberties. The obviously right
handed Mr. Swenson does not re
alize that his statement is about
as clouded by conservative Ameri
can ideology and paranoia as is
possible.
If a flaw in our system exists
and is pointed out by a Commun
ist, a Socialist, an ambidexterous
banjo player, or Barry Goldwater,
the flaw exists just as surely as
if Mr. Swenson happened to dis
cover it.
To fail to act upon any flaw in
our system just because of the
political color of the people who
point it out is to have one’s eyes
dangerously “fogged by ideology.”
Ron Walter
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford Board of Trustees
has shown complete disregard of
its moral obligations to the com
munities below the Stanford hills
by its opposition to the Ladera
Dam proposal. Because of Stan

ford land developments, anolher
flood, as occurred in 19155. 1956
and 1958, looms greater than ever
before.
But still Stanford and its les
sees continue their land develop
ment and do nothing to alleviate
the drainage problems they help
to create.

Stanford officials dismissed the
unbiased proposal of Corps of
Engineers by saying “the 525
acres were too valuable,’’ and “the
proposal was contrary to the in
terests of Stanford.” Will its pres
ent value and its potential earning
power balance the ill-will and the
probable multimillion dollar suits
in the case of another flood?
Stanford officials have hinted at
an alternative to the proposal ac
cording to the local newspaper.
But why only hints? The studies
for the proposal were begun in
1956.

Is the delay in concrete expres
sion to prevent appraisal before
the hearing in Washington Oct.
20? Or do they really have a work
able alternative?

San Francisquito Creek is al
ready a raging torrent at flood
times and it can’t be widened or
deepened safely. Perhaps they
would like to use someone else’s
valuable land in a less favorable
site.

But then assuming the proposal
is defeated and considering pres
ent trends, what will be the char
acter of the reservoir site 10 years
from now?
Will it be that of a national
laboratory such as Brookhaven or
Argonne? Or will it be that of the
Bay Area industrial or residential
complex? I for one would prefer
a lake to more scarred hills, fac
tories, and houses.

The Stanford Board of Trustees
has shown complete disregard of
its moral obligations to the com
munities below the Stanford hills
by its opposition to the Ladera
Dam proposal. Because of Stan

ford land developments, anolher
flood, as occurred in 19155. 1956
and 1958, looms greater than ever
before.
But still Stanford and its les
sees continue their land develop
ment and do nothing to alleviate
the drainage problems they help
to create.

Stanford officials dismissed the
unbiased proposal of Corps of
Engineers by saying “the 525
acres were too valuable,’’ and “the
proposal was contrary to the in
terests of Stanford.” Will its pres
ent value and its potential earning
power balance the ill-will and the
probable multimillion dollar suits
in the case of another flood?
Stanford officials have hinted at
an alternative to the proposal ac
cording to the local newspaper.
But why only hints? The studies
for the proposal were begun in
1956.

Is the delay in concrete expres
sion to prevent appraisal before
the hearing in Washington Oct.
20? Or do they really have a work
able alternative?

San Francisquito Creek is al
ready a raging torrent at flood
times and it can’t be widened or
deepened safely. Perhaps they
would like to use someone else’s
valuable land in a less favorable
site.

But then assuming the proposal
is defeated and considering pres
ent trends, what will be the char
acter of the reservoir site 10 years
from now?
Will it be that of a national
laboratory such as Brookhaven or
Argonne? Or will it be that of the
Bay Area industrial or residential
complex? I for one would prefer
a lake to more scarred hills, fac
tories, and houses.

Editor, The Daily:
It grieves me to differ with Ron
ald B. Swenson’s letter in Wednes
day’s Daily, especially since it is
so difficult to figure out what
that letter means.

Even though Mr. Swenson does
not appear to approve of Gold
water’s plans for Cuba, his own
idea of giving our “southern
neighbor” a “switching out in the
tool shed,” seems to present cer
tain technical problems. Mr. Swen
son criticizes the editor for having
no answer of his own; but with
what does Mr. Swenson propose
to spank Cuba, presuming that a
spanking is really what Cuba
needs ?

Mr. Swenson also says that his
“vision is not so clogged by ide
ologies” that he cannot see that
“Communists, Nazis, or left-hand
ed writers” are determined ulti
mately to destroy him and his
civil liberties. The obviously right
handed Mr. Swenson does not re
alize that his statement is about
as clouded by conservative Ameri
can ideology and paranoia as is
possible.
If a flaw in our system exists
and is pointed out by a Commun
ist, a Socialist, an ambidexterous
banjo player, or Barry Goldwater,
the flaw exists just as surely as
if Mr. Swenson happened to dis
cover it.
To fail to act upon any flaw in
our system just because of the
political color of the people who
point it out is to have one’s eyes
dangerously “fogged by ideology.”
