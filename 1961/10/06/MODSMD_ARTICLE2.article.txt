EAST LANSING, Mich., Oct. 5
—Stanford’s upset-minded foot
ball team arrived here tonight
and was greeted by officials at
Michigan State University, a mo
torcycle escort and various and
assorted not-too-well wishers.
After seven-and-a-half hours in
the air, the 39-man including
coaches and sportswriters con
tingent was welcomed with the
likes of MSU athletic director
Biggie Munn. a two-wheeling num
ber of East Lansing’s finest, and
a contingent of fancy automobiles.
The latter were supplied by a
local Spartan booster and pro
vided transportation to Stanford’s
motel.
The Indians will spend tomor
row exploring the intricacies of
Spartan Stadium while trying to
perfect some sort of an ofense
which might bolster their chances
of pulling off what would be the
major upset of this season when
they tangle with MSU tomorrow.
Somewhere in the vicinity of
30.000 fans are expected to watch
State’s home opener and the locals
are a whopping 14 % -point favor
ite.
Ranked fourth in the country
on the strength of a 20-0 win over
Wisconsin last week, the Spartans
will go with a lineup heavy in the
line and powerful in the hackfield.
Three of the linemen weigh over
245 pounds and the rest aren’t far
behind.
Junior quarterback Pete Smith
is expected to start at the signal
calling post for State and power
runners Charon, Gary Allman and
Ron Hatcher will also be doing a
bit of running.
The Spartans are plenty deep
with runners such as George
Saimes, who scored twice last
week, waiting in the wings should
duty call.

Stanford coach Jack Curtice
said that sophomore quarterback
Steve Thurlow will start tomor
row because “It’s his turn,’’ but
Rod Sears, who has been working

with the number one unit in prar
tice all week, will see heavy ac
tion.

Gary Craig and Larry Royse

will start at the halfback posts
and Hal Steuber will open up at
fullback.

A happy note for the Indians
came in the form of Jim Smith re
turned to action. Smith, who was
seriously challenging Sears for
the lop quarterback spot before
(he season opened, was sidelined
with a serious shoulder injury be
fore the Tulane game.
Though the big Oregonian still
can’t make southern backward
movements with his arms, Curtice
plans to use him at wingback and
in the defensive backfield.
Curtice was named Coach of
the Week by UPI on the strength
of Stanford’s upset wins over Tu
lane and Oregon State. If the In
dians win this one, Cactus Jack
may well be voted Coach of the
Century.

The Stanford ■ Michigan
State football game tomorrow
will be broadcast over radio
station KCBS starting at
J0;30. Don Klein will broad
cast the play by play.


GEORGE SAIMES - LEADING SPARTAN GROUND GAINER
Saimes vaulted from the second to the first team last week and
averaged 11 yards a carry against Wisconsin.


ROYCE BREAKS INTO THE OPEN FIELD
Stanford mainstay Larry Royce—Card senior is Stanford's top rusher
and a talented pass receiver. Royce has also starred defensively
from his wingback post.

EAST LANSING, Mich., Oct. 5
—Stanford’s upset-minded foot
ball team arrived here tonight
and was greeted by officials at
Michigan State University, a mo
torcycle escort and various and

the air, the 39-man including
coaches and sportswriters con
tingent was welcomed with the
likes of MSU athletic director
Biggie Munn. a two-wheeling num
ber of East Lansing’s finest, and
a contingent of fancy automobiles.
The latter were supplied by a
local Spartan booster and pro
vided transportation to Stanford’s
motel.
The Indians will spend tomor
row exploring the intricacies of
Spartan Stadium while trying to
perfect some sort of an ofense
which might bolster their chances
of pulling off what would be the
major upset of this season when
they tangle with MSU tomorrow.
Somewhere in the vicinity of
30.000 fans are expected to watch
State’s home opener and the locals
are a whopping 14 % -point favor

Ranked fourth in the country
on the strength of a 20-0 win over
Wisconsin last week, the Spartans
will go with a lineup heavy in the
line and powerful in the hackfield.
Three of the linemen weigh over
245 pounds and the rest aren’t far
behind.
Junior quarterback Pete Smith
is expected to start at the signal
calling post for State and power
runners Charon, Gary Allman and
Ron Hatcher will also be doing a
bit of running.
The Spartans are plenty deep
