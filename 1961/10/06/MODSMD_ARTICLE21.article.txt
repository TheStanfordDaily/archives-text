# MURDERERS' ROW'
## Big Five Faces Nation's Best 
### 
The Big Five meets the Big Ten
tomorrow with three games
scheduled between the two con
ferences, UCLA meets Ohio State
and LTSC faces lowa, in addiiton to
the Stanford-MSU clash.

In other games Cal meets Mis
souri and Washington is at Pitt

USC, hampered by inexperience
in earlier games, meets the na
tion’s number one team in lowa.
The Hawkeyes, with eight return
ing starters from last year, rolled
over Cal last week, 28-7. Their
quarterback, Wilburn Hollis, is a
possible All-American this year.

Coach John McKay’s Trojans
have counted mostly on speed and
deception in splitting two games
this season. Sophomore back Wil
lie Brown and a pair of 9.7
sprinters, back Lynn Gaskill and
end Jim Bates supply much of
USC’s speed.
Against Southern Methodist
last week, Brown raced 92 yards
for a score in the first quarter.
The UCLA Bruins, beaten by
Michigan, 29-6, last week, travel to

Ohio to meet OSU’s All-American
fullback, Bob Ferguson, a near
team by himself. Last week, Ohio
State tied Texas Christian, 7-7.

UCLA, operating out of a single
wing, has jnissed last year’s All-
American tailback Bill Kilmer in
early season games. Michigan
took advantage of short punts,
fumbles, and a pass interception
to upset the Bruins last Saturday.
Cal meets Missouri, undefeated
Orange Bowl champs last year.
The Bears were crushed 28-7 by
lowa while Missouri edged Minne
sota, 6-0, in last week’s games.
Cal had a 271 record last year,
and hasn’t looked too much better
in games this year. George Piero
vich, who produced Cal’s only
score against lowa, and quarter
back Randy Gold are counted on
most heavily by Coach Marv Levy
against Missouri.
Washington, at home against
Pitt, has been hit hard by gradu
ation. Rose Bowl champs last sea
son, they are favored by only a
half point against a mediocre
Panlher squad.
