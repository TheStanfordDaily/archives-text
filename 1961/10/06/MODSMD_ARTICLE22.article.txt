## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanfordâ€™s improving booters
hope to find the winning combina
tion against powerful Hayward
United in a practice game tomor
row in preparation for the league
season beginning next week. The
contest starts at 1:00 on the Stan
ford soccer field.
The junior varsity also sees
action tomorrow against Polytech
nic of San Francisco, while the
freshmen tangle with Menlo Col
lege.
SOCCER Coach Fred Priddle
expects to use the game to experi
ment with his many fine substi
tutes in an effort to field a strong
second line behind the regular's.
Priddle hopes the added week of
practice will make the Indians
more effective than they were in
the NCISC tournament last week
end where they finished fourth,
looking extremely rusty from the
summer layoff.

The Stanford starting lineup in
cludes either Beau Bianchi, Hunt
Bascom, or Dave Dierdorff at
goalie; Dan Farthing and Rich
Lonergan, fullbacks; Rusty Wil
liams, Don Burr and Rune Enge
brettson. halfbacks; and Mike
Tippett, Albert Nnoli, Emmanuel
Andah, Larry Chukwedebe and
Adam Bianchi, forwards.

PRIDDLE also expects to see
plenty of action from Ed Clarke,
Sam Edwards, Bill Hatch. Ed Ber
ner, Kieuanaka Epafaladito and
Mike Ero.

The key spot in the Stanford
lineup is the center-halfback posi
tion, which is being fought for by
three capable men, sophomore
Hatch, junior Burr, and senior
Berner. Priddle likes Hatch be
cause of his potential and size but
Burner and Burr have the edge at
the moment because of their
greater experience and aggres
siveness.
