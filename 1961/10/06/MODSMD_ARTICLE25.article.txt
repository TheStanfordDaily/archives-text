# SERIES TIED UP
## Reds Dump Yanks 6-2 Jay, Defense Sparkle 
### OSCAR FRALEY 
Jocy Jay’s four-hit pitching led Cincinnati's castoffs to a 6-2
victory yesterday as they draped the scorned mantle of fielding
“hatchers'' on the New York Yankees to square the World Series
at one game each.
Jay, himself a reject from Milwaukee, took advantage of ailing

Mickey Mantle’s absence to hand-"
cuff Roger Maris and pitch him
self out of several jams while the
mighty Yankees simplified his
task with three errors and a cost
ly "nap” by catcher Elston How
ard.
Behind him, the Reds played
flawless ball and rapped loser
Ralph Terry and reliever Luis
Arroyo for nine hits — including
a two-run homer in the fourth by
Gordy Coleman. Jay faltered mo
mentarily when Yogi Berra tied
it up minutes later with a tying
shot into the stands.
BUT then the Yankees — whose
errors had set up Coleman’s two
run drive - started coming apart
at the seams as the Reds played
like the champions they have been
telling (he doubters they were.
The Reds jumped into a 2-0 lead
in the top of the fourth inning
when Cletis Boyer, the Yankee
third baseman who was the field
ing star of the opening game,
found the truism of the old axiom
concerning yesterday’s heroes.
The slick fielder booted Frank
Robinson's grounder and Cole
man followed him by rifling his
homer into the right field bleach
ers.
That lead wasn’t destined to
last more than a few minutes.
Maris drew a lead-off walk in the
bottom of the fourth and the
crowd roared to life when the
squat Berra poled his lying two
run homer into the lower right
field seats.
THE REDS bounced right back
for what was to be their biggest
run with two out in the fifth for
a 3-2 lead.
With two away, Chacon singled
and went to third on Ed Kasko’s
single to center. With Vada Pin
son at bat, Howard lot a passed
ball drift 10 feet in back of him
and the Yankee catcher, with his
eye on Kasko going down to sec
ond, never saw Chacon racing
toward the palte.
Terry was slow in covering and
the flying Venezuelan slid safely
in under Howard’s belated dive
for the plate.
THE REDS ran (heir lead to 4-2
in the sixth, again with two out.
Wally Post set it up with a double
off the left field wall. Gene Freese
was passed intentionally but the
strategy backfired when Johnny
Edwards, a .182-hitting substitute
catcher, singled to right to send
Post home.
Terry departed disconsolately in
the bottom of the seventh lor a
pinch hitter after allowing six hits
and four runs in seven innings
and the Yankees called on Arroyo.
Arroyo began the (op of the
eighth with a walk to Frank Rob

inson. Then Coleman topped a ball
down the third base line and Ar
royo threw wildly into right field.
Robinson raced around to score
but Coleman was out at third base
as Yankee right fielder Johnny
Blanchard whipped a strike to
Boyer at third.
BERRA then lost Post’s routine
fly to left field, the ball squirting
through his hands and legs and
rolling all the way to the wall.
Freese was passed intentionally
but Edwards, the lightly-regarded
rookie, blooped a broken-hat dou
ble over the infield which scored
Post.
That was all Jay needed as he
wrapped it up and sent the deli
rious Reds hack home all even for
resumption of the series tomor
row in Crosley Field.
