# Piersall Goes To Senators
## 
### 
(UP) Baseball’s “had boy,”
Jim Piersall, was acquired by the
Washington Senators from the
Cleveland Indians Thursday in a
five-player trade.
The Senators, out to improve
their ninth place finish in the
American League, sent pitcher
Dick Donovan and catcher-out
fielder Gene Green to the Indi
ans. Also dispatched to Cleveland
was shortstop Jim Mahoney, who
played with Columbus of the In
ternational League.
A fourth player, probably
“high” in Washington’s farm sys
tem, will be sent to Cleveland by
January 1.
