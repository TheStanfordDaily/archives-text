# Legislature Votes to Aid Poli Union
## 
### JERKY RANKIN Editor 
Stanford’s student Legislature,
in its first meeting of the year,
last night agreed to help a
troubled Political Union get
“back on its feet.”

After hearing a report on the
group’s problems, LASSU voted
to allow its By-Laws and Rules
Committee and the Union’s only
two officers to draw up a new
constitution and submit it to
LASSU next week for discussion.
Jock Mcßaine, administrative
assistant to ASSU President Bob
Sayler, told LASSU that Political
Union “is in trouble,” and “needs
help.”
EAWRIE Chickering, elected
the Poli Union president last
year, admitted “Political Union
does need revision very badly.”

Only three of the 12 members
of the guiding executive board
were elected last spring, and one
of the trio isn’t in school. Mc-
Baine said the Union can’t and
shouldn’t function this year un
der its present by-laws.
He also reported a “certain
amount of friction” among the
students who regard themselves
as leaders of the four caucuses
of the group.
He noted particularly a “battle
among . . . slates of candidates”
to see who is head of the Demo
cratic and Republican caucuses.

THK TWO officers now can’t
solve the problem legally, he
pointed out, since the Poli Union
executive board must make
changes and 10 of its chairs are
vacant.
He suggested (he board could
be filled by appointment of a
committee made up of Chicker
ing, Poli Union Vice President
Jim Rogers and some Legisla
ture members.
In other action, LASSU ap
proved Brad Efron as editor of
this year’s Chaparral.
EFRON was suspended from
school spring quarter after edit
ing a parody of Playboy maga
zine which Dean of Students H.
Donald Winbigler ruled unaccept
able. Efron told LASSU last night
that he and the dean had dis
cussed the situation and Winhig
ler had no objection to his resum

ing his editorship.
Efron added that he realizes
“fully what you can’t print at
Stanford” and that he wouldn’t
“go off Ihe deep end.”

shouldn’t function this year un
der its present by-laws.

amount of friction” among the
students who regard themselves
as leaders of the four caucuses
of the group.
He noted particularly a “battle
among . . . slates of candidates”
to see who is head of the Demo
cratic and Republican caucuses.

THK TWO officers now can’t
solve the problem legally, he
pointed out, since the Poli Union
executive board must make
changes and 10 of its chairs are

in its first meeting of the year,
last night agreed to help a
troubled Political Union get
“back on its feet.”

group’s problems, LASSU voted
to allow its By-Laws and Rules
Committee and the Union’s only
two officers to draw up a new
constitution and submit it to
LASSU next week for discussion.
Jock Mcßaine, administrative
assistant to ASSU President Bob
Sayler, told LASSU that Political
Union “is in trouble,” and “needs
help.”
EAWRIE Chickering, elected
the Poli Union president last

does need revision very badly.”
