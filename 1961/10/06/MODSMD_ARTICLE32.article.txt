# Campaign Seeks Employees' Gifts
## 
### 
The Santa Clara County United
Fund is currently campaigning
for its goal of $20,000, according
to Edward Scoles of the Univer
sity Business Office, who has 125
assistants in the University’s vari
ous departments gathering funds.
The Fund covers University em-

ployees, and the money is solicited
from employees, not from stu
dents. Scoles emphasized. These
gifts of the employees through the
University wind up in the donor’s
own community, he said.
