# Rayburn Dying of Cancer; No Hope
## 
### 
DALLAS (UPD—House Speak-"
er Sam Rayburn, 79. is dying of
cancer. Hospital tests yesterday
showed there was no hope.
Rayburn was not told. A sur
geon took a sample of tissue from
“Mr. Sam’s” groin at Baylor Uni
versity Medical Center yesterday
and found in it a “metatatic ma
lignancy.”
THIS MEANT that the cancer
developed somewhere else prob
ably in Rayburn’s pancreas -and
that the cells have broken loose
and spread the malignancy to
other parts of his body.
A spokesman for the hospital
said the cancer probably has
spread to most of the lower half
of his body.
“NO FURTHER surgery is an
ticipated," a bulletin announcing
his condition said. A spokesman
for the hospital said the only sur
gery performed was what was
necessary to get the tissue
sample.
Asked how long Rayburn will
live, Dr. Robert F. Short Jr., in
charge of his case, said: "There
is no way of telling.”
Rayburn was under sedation
from the operation necessary to
get the tissue sample when Dr.
Short issued a short bulletin, an
nouncing that he had cancer.
RAYBURN’S sisters, Mrs. W.
A. Thomas of Dallas and Mrs.
Robert Bartley of Bonham, Tex.,
have been with him since Mon
day, when he entered the hospi
tal. A friend said they were “re
signed to it.”
Vico President Lyndon B. John
son, a protege of Rayburn, de
clined to comment at once when
he heard that Rayburn has can
cer. Johnson is at his ranch near
Johnson City.
DR. SHORT said he telephoned
Dr. Edith Travell, President Ken
nedy’s physician, in Washington
an hour before he publicly an
nounced that Rayburn had can
cer.

When severe back pains forced
the speaker to leave Washington
Aug. 31, a month before Congress
adjourned, he knew only that he
had “lumbago.” Rayburn said
that had been the diagnosis of
physicians in the capital.
Rayburn went to his home in
Bonham, Tex., where he hoped
rest would end the pains. They
persisted, and his Bonham physi
cian urged him to go to Dallas
for observation at Baylor Uni
versity Medical Center.

LESS THAN a month ago, Ray
burn said persons predicting he
would never return to Washing
ton were “damned fools.”

Rayburn was first elected to
Congress in 1912. He had been
reelected every two years since.
He served in the House longer
than any other man in history
and was speaker twice as long
as any other man.

er Sam Rayburn, 79. is dying of
cancer. Hospital tests yesterday
showed there was no hope.
Rayburn was not told. A sur
geon took a sample of tissue from
“Mr. Sam’s” groin at Baylor Uni
versity Medical Center yesterday
and found in it a “metatatic ma
lignancy.”
THIS MEANT that the cancer
developed somewhere else prob
ably in Rayburn’s pancreas -and
that the cells have broken loose
and spread the malignancy to
other parts of his body.
A spokesman for the hospital
said the cancer probably has
spread to most of the lower half
of his body.
“NO FURTHER surgery is an
ticipated," a bulletin announcing
his condition said. A spokesman
for the hospital said the only sur
gery performed was what was
necessary to get the tissue
sample.
Asked how long Rayburn will
live, Dr. Robert F. Short Jr., in
charge of his case, said: "There
is no way of telling.”
Rayburn was under sedation
from the operation necessary to
get the tissue sample when Dr.
Short issued a short bulletin, an
nouncing that he had cancer.
RAYBURN’S sisters, Mrs. W.
A. Thomas of Dallas and Mrs.
Robert Bartley of Bonham, Tex.,
have been with him since Mon
day, when he entered the hospi
tal. A friend said they were “re
signed to it.”
Vico President Lyndon B. John
son, a protege of Rayburn, de
clined to comment at once when
he heard that Rayburn has can
cer. Johnson is at his ranch near
Johnson City.
DR. SHORT said he telephoned
Dr. Edith Travell, President Ken

an hour before he publicly an
nounced that Rayburn had can

When severe back pains forced
the speaker to leave Washington
Aug. 31, a month before Congress
adjourned, he knew only that he

that had been the diagnosis of
physicians in the capital.
