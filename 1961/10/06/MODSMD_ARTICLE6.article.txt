# Need for Idealistic Volunteers

“No other university in the
country has as much to offer the
Peace Corps as Stanford,” stated
Peter Grofhe, referring to the fact
that so many Stanford students
have had experience overseas, are
capable in handling a second lan
guage and have experienced the
“so-called cultural shock.”

Grothe, a special consultant to
the Peace Corps, spoke last night
at Cubborley in an lIR-Political
Union sponsored talk. He briefly
outlined answers to questions
such as, who is wanted in the
Peace Corps? and how are Peace
Corps members trained?
“There exists a staggering need
for skilled people in many under
developed countries,” Grothe said,
mentioning that Ghana has only
17 college graduates to run its
government, and Angola has no
college graduates and only 12 high
school graduates.
Grothe stressed the urgent need
for teachers, since over half the
requests from underdeveloped
countries are for teachers. Over
300,000 teachers are needed for
Africa alone.”
“The Peace Corps is especially
anxious to get people who have
just graduated from college
teaching experience is not neces
sary,” Grothe added, emphasizing
the desirability of the liberal arts
graduate.
For the men in the crowd,
Grothe mentioned that Peace
Corps service does not eliminate
a man from the draft, but will
only allow deferment.

Outlining the steps necessary
to Join the Peace Corps, Grothe
urged students to fill out the vol
unteer questionnaire necessary to
take the examination to bo given
Nov. 28-29. After taking the ex
amination a candidate would be
notified by April of his appoint
ment and would begin training in
June.

“The training program is
rough.” Grothe stated, citing the
two-mile run before breakfast
(for men only), the rock climbing,
survival training and rope climb
ing which are included in the 26-
day session at training camp in
Puerto Rico, run by Chaplain Wil
liam Coffin of Yale.

Peace Corps members are given
two to five months of training at
a university where they learn the
language, (lit* politics, and the cus-

Toms of the area where they will
be sent.
No salary is paid to members
while they are abroad other than
living expenses and enough to
travel for 30 days. However, $75
for each month of the 24-month
service period is accumulated for
the member’s return.
Grothe concluded by mentioning
the question of an Indian woman
asked Sargent Shriver, Director
of the Peace Corps; “Can the
Peace Corps volunteer meet the
dedication of the Chinese Com
munists? Grothe thinks that the
idealism and dedication of those
volunters whom he has met can
much more than meet such dedi
cation.
