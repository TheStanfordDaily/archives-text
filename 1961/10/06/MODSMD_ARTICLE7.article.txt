# W. Germans, Vopos in Cross-Border Firing
## 
### 
BERLIN—( UPl)—Communist police fired gunshots twice more
into West Berlin yesterday and smashed a West German police car
windshield with a barrage of stones. There were no casualties and
West Berlin police did not return the fire.
But the Communist action—the second consecutive day of across-

the - border shooting—heightened
Berlin tensions. U.S. Army pa
trols were roaming the border
under orders alerting them to
“meet any situation that might
arise.”

THE COMMUNISTS protested
officially as a threat to peace an
incident Wednesday night in
which East and West Berlin po
lice exchanged about 40 shots.
The protest came after West
Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt con
ferred on tighter border patrols
with retired Gen. Lucius D. Clay
on Wednesday night’s incident.
Brandt left later for the United
States before the Communist pro
test was received.

The State Department in Wash
ington blamed the shooting on the
Communists and said it seriously
jeopardized peace and public or
der.

WEST BERLIN officials noted
that in each of yesterday’s inci
dents West Berliners appeared to
be the targets. In the past only
refugees fleeing to the West have
been the targets.
A U.S. Army spokesman said
American troops patrolling the
East-West Berlin border were

“ready for any contingency.” But
he would not say whether they
had been ordered to fire back if
fired upon. The spokesman said
West Berlin police have orders to
fire only in self-defense and to
protect West Berlin lives.
IN YESTERDAY’S first inci
dent the Communists fired four
machine pistol shots at a West
Berlin electric worker who
strayed a yard into East Berlin
while laying a cable. He was not
hit.

The second incident flared when
Communist police began throw
ing stones at a West Berlin loud
speaker truck near the border,
smashing its windshield. A police
car rolled up and a Western po
liceman ordered the Reds to halt.

A Communist policeman threat
ened to shoot unless Western po
lice withdrew. He then fired one
machine pistol shot but missed.
THE COMMUNIST protest was
made by East German Interior
Minister Karl Maron in letters
to Brig. Gen, Jean Lacomme, Ber
lin’s French commandant, and to
Brandt. He said the West would
bear full responsibility for the
“serious results of such provoca
tions.”

In Wednesday night’s incident
three Communist policemen
opened fire while they chased
two men who were trying to flee
to West Berlin. The bullets splat
tered into West Berlin and West
Berlin police returned,the fire,
wounding one Vopo Communist
People’s Police.
ONE OF THE would-be refu
gees was captured and dragged
away with the wounded police
man. The other leaped to his
death from the roof of a four
story apartment when he missed
a safety net held by West Berlin
firemen.

Maron’s protest spoke of only
one refugee and said ho was a
man who had committed a crimi
nal act and was attempting to
flee. He said the Reds fired only
“warning shots’’ but that the
West Berlin police took aim at
the Vopos.
The Communist protest was
sent to the French because the
borderline apartment house is at
the edge of the French sector.

away with the wounded police
man. The other leaped to his
death from the roof of a four
story apartment when he missed
a safety net held by West Berlin
firemen.

Maron’s protest spoke of only
one refugee and said ho was a
man who had committed a crimi
nal act and was attempting to
flee. He said the Reds fired only
“warning shots’’ but that the
West Berlin police took aim at
the Vopos.
The Communist protest was
sent to the French because the
borderline apartment house is at
the edge of the French sector.
BERLIN—( UPl)—Communist police fired gunshots twice more
into West Berlin yesterday and smashed a West German police car
windshield with a barrage of stones. There were no casualties and
West Berlin police did not return the fire.
But the Communist action—the second consecutive day of across-

the - border shooting—heightened
Berlin tensions. U.S. Army pa
trols were roaming the border
under orders alerting them to
“meet any situation that might
arise.”

THE COMMUNISTS protested
officially as a threat to peace an
incident Wednesday night in
which East and West Berlin po
lice exchanged about 40 shots.
The protest came after West
Berlin Mayor Willy Brandt con
ferred on tighter border patrols
with retired Gen. Lucius D. Clay
on Wednesday night’s incident.
Brandt left later for the United
States before the Communist pro
test was received.

The State Department in Wash
ington blamed the shooting on the
Communists and said it seriously
jeopardized peace and public or
der.

WEST BERLIN officials noted
that in each of yesterday’s inci
dents West Berliners appeared to
be the targets. In the past only
refugees fleeing to the West have
been the targets.
A U.S. Army spokesman said
American troops patrolling the
East-West Berlin border were

“ready for any contingency.” But
he would not say whether they
had been ordered to fire back if
fired upon. The spokesman said
West Berlin police have orders to
fire only in self-defense and to
protect West Berlin lives.
IN YESTERDAY’S first inci
dent the Communists fired four
machine pistol shots at a West
Berlin electric worker who
strayed a yard into East Berlin
while laying a cable. He was not
hit.

The second incident flared when
Communist police began throw
ing stones at a West Berlin loud
speaker truck near the border,
smashing its windshield. A police
car rolled up and a Western po
liceman ordered the Reds to halt.

A Communist policeman threat
ened to shoot unless Western po
lice withdrew. He then fired one
machine pistol shot but missed.
THE COMMUNIST protest was
made by East German Interior
Minister Karl Maron in letters
to Brig. Gen, Jean Lacomme, Ber
lin’s French commandant, and to
Brandt. He said the West would
bear full responsibility for the
“serious results of such provoca
tions.”

In Wednesday night’s incident
three Communist policemen
opened fire while they chased
two men who were trying to flee
to West Berlin. The bullets splat
tered into West Berlin and West
Berlin police returned,the fire,
wounding one Vopo Communist
People’s Police.
ONE OF THE would-be refu
gees was captured and dragged
away with the wounded police
man. The other leaped to his
