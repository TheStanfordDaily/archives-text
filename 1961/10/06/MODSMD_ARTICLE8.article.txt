### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The
United States yesterday accused
the Communists of endangering
peace in Berlin on the eve of cru
cial talks between President Ken
nedy and Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko.
The State Department blamed
the East Berlin Communists for
the exchange of gunfire across
the East-West border and said it
“could seriously jeopardize” peace
in the divided city.

IT REMINDED the Russians in
a statement that the United States
repeatedly had warned Soviet au
thorities in the former German
capital of the danger of such in
cidents.

The statement by spokesman
Joseph Reap referred to Wednes
day night’s incident when the
Communists opened fire on two
refugees seeking to flee the Red
Zone. This was followed yesterday
by Communist police twice firing
into West Berlin.

U.S. OFFICIALS said they ex
pected Kennedy in his talk with
Gromyko late Friday to stress the

vital necessity of avoiding dan
gerous incidents if there are to be
worthwhile East-West negotia
tions on the smoldering Berlin
crisis.
It was reported that Kennedy
was anxious to stress to Gromyko
—and thus to Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev the firm determin
ation of the Western powers to
defend, by all necessary force
their position in and access to
Berlin.
KENNEDY was expected to ask
Gromyko to convey to Khrush
chev the willingness of the United
States and its Allies to enter for
mal negotiations on the Berlin
crisis once Russia acknowledges
the vital interests of the Western
powers.
Officials said the President
wants Gromyko to take back to
Khrushchev a very clear under
standing of the extreme peril, in
cluding the possibility of nuclear
war, if the Kremlin miscalculates
Allied determination.
