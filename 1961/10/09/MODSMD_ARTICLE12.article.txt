# U.S. Communists Not Prime Problem
## 
### 
The Daily’s statement last week that it would be willing to
accept the help of “a Communist, a Nazi or a left-handed cricket
player” in defending civil liberties has drawn—as might be expec
ted —an interesting reaction.
The reaction which interests us most is the one from people who
say that we, by stating what we did, do not know what the Reds are
up to, and that we—so they tell us—are assuming Communists are
loyal Americans.
Apparently, for these persons, we should have added a para
graph to the editorial indicating that we do, indeed, realize the
ultimate aims of communism and its American adherents.
We have no illusions that civil liberties would stand for long if
Communists gained power in the United States. Nor do we believe
we coidd be writing editorials such as this if Communists were
entrenched in the nation’s Capital.
And we are not of the opinion that American Communists are
loyal followers of democratic tradition and the Constitution. We
think we have now made this clear.
However, we still feel that Communists deserve the protection
of the Constitution, and that it is possible for a Communist to hon
estly believe in civil liberties and work for them.
We also are inclined to go along with Robert Kennedy. The
U.S. attorney general said in San Francisco last Thursday that the
U.S. is in primary danger from Communists outside this nation.
The U.S. Communist party “has lost its power,” and ‘lias very
little following,” he declared. Anyone who has read the history of
the U.S. Communist party in the last two decades would realize
that all is not sweetness and light within the Party. Disagreement
and internecine battles have sapped its strength.
What worries us is the man in the Kremlin and his friends in
Peiping, Warsaw, East Berlin and other spots around the globe.
We also are more worried about people such as the Sunnyvale
(11 miles from Stanford) city councilman who advocates throwing
books giving the Russian viewpoint out of the city library and
barring Communists from public office, than we are about current
domestic Communists.
