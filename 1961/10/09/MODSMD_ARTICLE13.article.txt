## On a Successor to Dag 
### 
In the dispute about choosing a
successor to Dag Hammarskjold,
the true purpose of the Soviet
Government is to see to it that he
has no genuine successor. Under
Hammarskjold the United Nations
evolved beyond what he described
as “a conference machinery” into
a rudimentary, tentative, provi
sional experiment in international
government.
It is against this development
that the Soviet Union is striking,
using variations on the troika
principle as the instrument. Es
sentially, what the Soviet govern
ment intends to do is to force the
abolition of the Secretary Gener
al’s office as it developed under
Hammarskjold, leaving the U.N.
again no more than a conference
machinery.
I should say in parenthesis that
I have not forgotten that before
Hammarskjold, the U.N. conduct
ed a great police action, on the
scale of a war. in Korea.
BUT THIS Korean action was
unique. For reasons which have
never been fully explained, the
Soviet government was absent
and did not exercise its veto when
the Security Council ordered the
Korean police action. There is no
likelihood that this could happen
again.
Therefore it is, I believe, correct
to say that the U.N. was no more
than a conference machinery until
Hammarskjold became the Secre
tary General.
In Laos, in Palestine, and then
in the Congo, he transformed the
U.N. from a debating forum into
an international power which leg
islated and executed policy. In
Laos probably, in the Congo cer
tainly, Hammarskjold’s action in
terfered and frustrated Commun
ist expansion, and this is the rea
son why the Soviet Government
is determined to abolish the kind
of Secretary General that Ham
marskjold was.
IN THIS policy of diminishing
the U.N. as a power in the world,
it must be said that Mr. Khrush

chev finds much support, never
avowed but nonetheless real, in
the West. He finds it particularly
in France. Gen. de Gaulle has
not taken off his shoe to demon
strate against the U.N., but he
has done much to weaken it by a
policy of studied insult.
This is a tragedy for the West
ern society as well as for the
United Nations. For it means that
France is absent from the work of
trying to establish order in the
world.
It is hard not to ask oneself
whether Hammarskjold’s essay
into international action was pre
mature. Certainly it would now be
a miracle if the Great Powers
which have vetoes in the Security
Council could agree on a Secre
tary General to carry on Hammar
skjold’s work.
IN THE LAST analysis the U.N.
exists and can grow only with the
concurrence of all the Great
Powers. They will not concur on
amendments to the Charter adopt
ing Mr. Khrushchev’s troika. But
he is not likely to concur in the
selection of another strong Secre
tary General.
The prospect is that out of the
dispute will come a weak Secre
tary General. He will not be neu
tral in the Hammarskjold style of
being an international civil serv
ant. He will be neutral in a popu
lar sense of being passive. The
U.N. will be back whore it started
15 years ago as a conference
machinery.
To bo a conference machinery
for the whole world is no mean
function, and in a world where
there are so many new nations
trying to find their way into the
future, a central organization of
conference is indispensable. More
over, this machinery, though in
evitably weakened in its executive
powers, will be conducted by men
who will not forget that the pos
sibility of greater things has been
shown.

islated and executed policy. In
Laos probably, in the Congo cer
tainly, Hammarskjold’s action in
terfered and frustrated Commun
ist expansion, and this is the rea
son why the Soviet Government
is determined to abolish the kind
of Secretary General that Ham
marskjold was.
IN THIS policy of diminishing
the U.N. as a power in the world,
it must be said that Mr. Khrush

chev finds much support, never
avowed but nonetheless real, in
the West. He finds it particularly
in France. Gen. de Gaulle has
not taken off his shoe to demon
strate against the U.N., but he
has done much to weaken it by a
policy of studied insult.
This is a tragedy for the West
ern society as well as for the
United Nations. For it means that
France is absent from the work of
trying to establish order in the
world.
It is hard not to ask oneself
whether Hammarskjold’s essay
into international action was pre
mature. Certainly it would now be
a miracle if the Great Powers
which have vetoes in the Security
Council could agree on a Secre
tary General to carry on Hammar
skjold’s work.
IN THE LAST analysis the U.N.
exists and can grow only with the
concurrence of all the Great
Powers. They will not concur on
amendments to the Charter adopt
ing Mr. Khrushchev’s troika. But
he is not likely to concur in the
selection of another strong Secre
tary General.
The prospect is that out of the
dispute will come a weak Secre
tary General. He will not be neu
tral in the Hammarskjold style of
being an international civil serv
ant. He will be neutral in a popu
lar sense of being passive. The
U.N. will be back whore it started
15 years ago as a conference
machinery.
To bo a conference machinery
for the whole world is no mean
function, and in a world where
there are so many new nations
trying to find their way into the
future, a central organization of
conference is indispensable. More
over, this machinery, though in
evitably weakened in its executive
powers, will be conducted by men
who will not forget that the pos

In the dispute about choosing a
successor to Dag Hammarskjold,
the true purpose of the Soviet
Government is to see to it that he
has no genuine successor. Under
Hammarskjold the United Nations
evolved beyond what he described
as “a conference machinery” into
a rudimentary, tentative, provi
sional experiment in international
government.
It is against this development
that the Soviet Union is striking,
using variations on the troika
principle as the instrument. Es
sentially, what the Soviet govern
ment intends to do is to force the
abolition of the Secretary Gener
al’s office as it developed under
Hammarskjold, leaving the U.N.
again no more than a conference
machinery.
I should say in parenthesis that
I have not forgotten that before
Hammarskjold, the U.N. conduct
ed a great police action, on the
scale of a war. in Korea.
BUT THIS Korean action was
unique. For reasons which have
never been fully explained, the
Soviet government was absent
and did not exercise its veto when
the Security Council ordered the
Korean police action. There is no
likelihood that this could happen
again.
Therefore it is, I believe, correct
to say that the U.N. was no more
than a conference machinery until
Hammarskjold became the Secre
tary General.
In Laos, in Palestine, and then
in the Congo, he transformed the
U.N. from a debating forum into
an international power which leg
islated and executed policy. In
Laos probably, in the Congo cer
