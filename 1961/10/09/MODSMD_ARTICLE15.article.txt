Editor, The Daily:
There are two facts on which
Ross Hermann is confused in his
article on the Bradens Oct. 5. My
primary objection to the article,
however, concerns the deliberate
ly misleading way in which it is
written.

First, both the Bradens and the
Negro family for whom they pur
chased a house made the fullest
use they were permitted of . . .
police protection to prevent the
violence with which they were
threatened from materializing
within their respective communi
ties in Louisville.

Second, the “box after box of
Communist literature” came not
from the Braden’s home, but from
the home of another Louisville
white who had offered his services
to the Negro family because he
believed they had the right to live
anywhere they wished.

There wore two theories about
the bombing. One was that the
Negro family’s neighbors wanted
to drive them out. . . . The other,
which the local prosecutor sought
to prove (completely disregarding
the first) was that the bombing
had been a Communist plot to stir
up trouble. The court’s justifica
tion of its conviction of Braden
could only have been compatible
with the second theory if the
bombing were explained as an
“inside job.”

. . . I . . . ask Mr. Hermann to
ponder these facts. (1) According
to the policeman on duty across
the street, the deafening noise of
the explosion apparently aroused
none of the surrounding white
households.

(2) On the first night the Negro
family moved in, a cross was burn
ed next door. Three men con
fessed. Criminal charges could
have been brought against them
under Kentucky law; they wore
never even indicted. (3) Anne
Braden said of the Grand Jury in
vestigation . . . “All those who re
fused on one ground or another
to answer some of the questions
were indicted. The refusal to an
swer was treated as an admission
of guilt.”
Finally, she has made this per
tinent comment: “Certainly, in al
most every case of the bombing
of a Negro’s home . . . the crime
has gone unpunished.” In this
case, unfortunately, there was a
convenient scapegoat on whom
one southern city had no qualms
about pinning the blame.

Editor, The Daily:
Near the beginning of his re
marks before LASSU last Thurs
day night regarding proposed al
terations in the structure of Po
litical Union’s constitution, Jock
Mcßaine, administrative assistant
to ASSU President Bob Sayler,
stated:
“The four caucuses (Socialist,
Democratic. Republican, Conserv
ative) should be and shall become
the backbone of the Political
Union.”
Later on, in a remarkably adept
display of rhetorical inconsisten
cy, Mcßaine recommended to
LASSU that Poly Union’s consti
tution be re-written to give the
four caucuses no voting power on
the Poly Union executive board.
What Mcßaine’s intentions are,
and what motives lie behind his
maneuverings, the student body

can only guess.
And guess will be about all the
student body will be able to do,
for by this coming Thursday’s
meeting the LASSU By-Laws and
Rules Committee will have finish
ed dictating to the “only two le

gal” Poly Union officers its ver
dict as to what Poly Union’s con
stitution should be.
And neither the student body
nor, it seems, Political Union, will
have much to say in the matter.
