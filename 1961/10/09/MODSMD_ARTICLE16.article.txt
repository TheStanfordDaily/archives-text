. WASHINGTON (UPI) - Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara
lias ordered the military to avoid
expressing their views unless they
are “non-partisan and in accord
ance with established national
policy.”
McNamara’s stiff new edict ap
peared to be directed against
military participation in seminars

such as the one held recently in
San Antonio, Tex., where some
administration policies were
sharply criticized.
It prohibits military partlcipa
tion that might “lend an air of
sponsorship to the statements of
others which may be either par
tisan in character or contrary to
established national policy.”
