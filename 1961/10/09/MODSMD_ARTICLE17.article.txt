Editor, The Daily:
India, when you look at the rec
ord, appears to be more neutral in
fancy than in fact. A look at her
voting record in the United Na
tions reveals that in a number of
issues of importance India has
either voted with the Soviet
Union or abstained from voting
with the United States on any is
sue which might embarrass the
Soviet Union. Here are a few ex
amples:
On Oct. 25, 1952, the Communist
bloc, and also India, voted against
postponement of considering Red
China for membership in the
United Nations.
Then, when the General Assem
bly, on Nov. 9, 1956. passed a reso
lution denouncing Soviet inter
ference in Hungary and demand
ing that Russian troops bo with
drawn, India was the only non-
Communist nation to vote against

it. Yet Nehru later loudly de
nounced the Anglo-French inva
sion of Egypt.
When the Soviets made a mo
tion to demand investigation of
the charges that the United States
used germ warfare in Korea, the
Free World voted overwhelming
ly against it on Oct. 21, 1952. In
dia abstained. Again, India ab
stained when the Communists ac
cused the United States of spying
behind the Iron Curtain.

Votes by the Free World de
feated this resolution, India also
abstained from supporting the
Free World in its condemnation of
the war atrocities which had
caused 30,000 deaths in Korea.

A continuation of the report of
India’s voting record in the United
Nations, or a consideration of
Nehru’s statements at the Bel
grade Conference recently would
show that, contrary to Mr. Huff

man’s statement (in last week’s
Daily), India is not a powerful
neutral in the United Nations.

She weakens her power to fight
for peace each time she refuses
to vote on matters of importance
to peace, and a country which re
peatedly supports the Soviet
Union or abstains from voting
against it, and which ignores ac
tual Soviet nuclear explosions
while condemning atomic testing
in general, little deserves the
name of neutral.

After four years at Stanford I
have become quite immune to A
Pho O’s peddling Time magazine
at the entrance of Mem And to un
suspecting students distracted by
registration procedures.
This year, however, I was mild
ly surprised to see that the omni
present subscription blank was
folded neatly in with the prospec
tus for the Stanford University
Supplemental Health Insurance
Program and other semi-official
registration materials.

In these days when labor unions
pay students to picket, why
shouldn’t Mr. Luce get Stanford
to distribute his advertising? I
only hoped A Phi O was still get
ting its proper rake-off.

But it seems that the Time per
centage, like the PACE pie. is cut
many ways. Upon opening my 39-
cent Stanford Seal Spiral Note
book I found bound as the first
page a cleverly camouflaged sub
scription blank entitled “A Memo
from your Bookstore Manager:
Tools of the Trade.”

The blurb explains that stu
dents would be “babes in the
woods” without textbooks, their
“tools of the trade.” It helpfully
suggests, “Visit your book dealer
often during your stay on the
campus. He is standing by, eager
and willing to help you acquire
‘the tools of your trade’.”
In small type at the bottom next
to the perforated blank, Time,
Inc., warns that our trade tools
and “college investment” may go
up “in smoke” if we don’t sub
scribe and get informed.
It might be debated who stands
by more eagerly and willingly, the
student to buy or the Stanford
Bookstore to sell a textbook. There
is no doubt, however, as to who is
selling magazines.

An open letter to C. Robert
Brown, Sunnyvale City Council;
Sir:

I suggest that you help get your
anti-Red campaign off to a spec
tacular start by holding a mam
moth public book-burning cere
mony in the center of downtown
Sunnyvale. There are simply
thousands of subversive pro-Red
books in our public libraries and,
believe it or not, many that were
actually written by Russian citi
zens such as Tolstoy, Pavlov, and
Pasternak.

With a little publicity thousands
of patriots would turn out to
chant around a leaping bonfire of
Communist-inspired literature. An
event like this would really put
Sunnyvale on the map.
At very little extra cost, all par
ticipants to this evening (and it
must be held after dark for full
effect) could be issued distinctive
arm-bands which would serve in
the future to distinguish them
from those who did not see fit to
help your cause.
