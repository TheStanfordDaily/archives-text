## Red China Should Be Allowed to Enter UN 
### DAVID S. FRENCH IIR Political Analyst 
Red China should be admitted
to the United Nations. The United
States is committed to avoiding
this, but the inevitable acceptance
by the U.N. of the Communist
regime in China, while a defeat
for this aspect of our foreign
policy, could easily have bene
ficial effects for the cause of
world peace.
The Barry Goldwater fringe in
this country would have us with
draw from the United Nations
when Red China is accepted by
that body. Goldwater said recent
ly, “A loyalty to (the ideals which
the U.N. was formed to serve) re
quires that we work to save the
United Nations by refusing to co
operate with it for so long as it
betrays those ideals.”
IN CONTRAST to this is the
feeling of many that no organiza
tion can claim to be truly inter
national while it excludes repre
sentatives of one-fourth of the
world’s population.
Both of these arguments miss a
more basic point. Simple condem
nation of the present regime in
China is a barren approach to a
complex problem, while recogni
tion of Peking on the basis of its
numerical strength alone has little
more relevance to the question of
world peace. Rather, to judge the
China question, we must antici
pate the effect of accepting Pe
king on Red China itself, as well
as on the United Nations.

China’s apparent militancy is
well known, and her ideological
disputes with Russia have estab
lished her imago as a nation hun
gry for conflict. To a considerable
extent, however, this strident tone
is coupled with a lack of real in
volvement in the world scene.
CHINA SIMPLY does not now
have the economic or military ca
pacity to take as active a part as
does Russia in world affairs.
Words are cheap, and China
lapses into an aggressive frenzy
of verbiage, while Russia does the
actual work of the Communist
bloc.

Chen I, Red China’s vice pre
mier and foreign minister, has
recognized this dependence on ob
jective conditions in talking of
relations with the United States:
“Is it possible for China and the
Soviet Union to agree with each
other in every respect? No, it is
impossible. The U.S. has diplo
matic relations with the U.S.S.R.,
but China has no such relations
with the United States. The Soviet
Union is a member of the United
Nations, but China is not. The
U.S. keeps occupying Taiwan but
no islands off the Soviet coast.”
CHINA’S approach to interna
tional relations is therefore at
least partially a function of those
relations.

Recognizing that China’s atti

tudes are influenced, then, by the
international context, within which
she operates, we should try to
draw her into increasing involve
ment in world affairs. As she is
forced to participate, rather than
simply to talk, her reliance on an
extreme body of theory should
deteriorate and her awareness of
international realities increase.
Admission to the United Na
tions is a first step toward pro
ducing this involvement. Students
of the U.N. point out a broad
range of areas where contacts are
made between nations at the U.N.
outside of the conference cham
bers as well as in actual debate.
THE CONSTANT participation
of Red China in day-to-day diplo
matic intercourse could have a
moderating influence on her jaun
diced view of the world, thus
strengthening the U.N.’s efforts
for peace.

There is little evidence to sug
gest that Red China’s presence in
the U.N. would materially weaken
that organization, The causes of
international conflict rest outside
of its walls, not within; and the
international situation will degen
erate no more rapidly for having
Red China around to discuss it.
China’s voice in the General As
sembly would be but one out of
101, and her possible veto in the
Security Council would mean rela
tively little on top of the absolute
veto which Russia already wields
there for the Communist bloc.
To accept Red China’s admis
sion to the United Nations is not,
then, to condone any aspect of her
policy, foreign or domestic.
Rather, this acceptance implies
an evaluation of the probable re
sults of her admission and the
feeling that these are likely to
further, rather than hinder, ef
forts toward international under
standing.

gry for conflict. To a considerable
extent, however, this strident tone
is coupled with a lack of real in
volvement in the world scene.
CHINA SIMPLY does not now
have the economic or military ca
pacity to take as active a part as
does Russia in world affairs.
Words are cheap, and China
lapses into an aggressive frenzy
of verbiage, while Russia does the
actual work of the Communist
bloc.

Chen I, Red China’s vice pre
mier and foreign minister, has
recognized this dependence on ob
jective conditions in talking of
relations with the United States:
“Is it possible for China and the
Soviet Union to agree with each
other in every respect? No, it is
impossible. The U.S. has diplo
matic relations with the U.S.S.R.,
but China has no such relations
with the United States. The Soviet
Union is a member of the United
Nations, but China is not. The
U.S. keeps occupying Taiwan but
no islands off the Soviet coast.”
CHINA’S approach to interna
tional relations is therefore at
least partially a function of those
relations.

Recognizing that China’s atti

tudes are influenced, then, by the
international context, within which
she operates, we should try to
draw her into increasing involve
ment in world affairs. As she is
forced to participate, rather than
simply to talk, her reliance on an
extreme body of theory should
deteriorate and her awareness of
international realities increase.
Admission to the United Na
tions is a first step toward pro
ducing this involvement. Students
of the U.N. point out a broad
range of areas where contacts are
made between nations at the U.N.
outside of the conference cham
bers as well as in actual debate.
THE CONSTANT participation
of Red China in day-to-day diplo
matic intercourse could have a
moderating influence on her jaun
diced view of the world, thus
strengthening the U.N.’s efforts
for peace.

There is little evidence to sug
gest that Red China’s presence in
the U.N. would materially weaken
that organization, The causes of
international conflict rest outside
of its walls, not within; and the
international situation will degen
erate no more rapidly for having
Red China around to discuss it.
China’s voice in the General As
sembly would be but one out of
101, and her possible veto in the
Security Council would mean rela
tively little on top of the absolute
veto which Russia already wields
there for the Communist bloc.
To accept Red China’s admis
sion to the United Nations is not,
then, to condone any aspect of her
policy, foreign or domestic.
Rather, this acceptance implies
an evaluation of the probable re
sults of her admission and the
feeling that these are likely to
further, rather than hinder, ef
forts toward international under
standing.
Red China should be admitted
to the United Nations. The United
States is committed to avoiding
this, but the inevitable acceptance
by the U.N. of the Communist
regime in China, while a defeat
for this aspect of our foreign
policy, could easily have bene
ficial effects for the cause of
world peace.
The Barry Goldwater fringe in
this country would have us with
draw from the United Nations
when Red China is accepted by
that body. Goldwater said recent
ly, “A loyalty to (the ideals which
the U.N. was formed to serve) re
quires that we work to save the
United Nations by refusing to co
operate with it for so long as it
betrays those ideals.”
IN CONTRAST to this is the
feeling of many that no organiza
tion can claim to be truly inter
national while it excludes repre
sentatives of one-fourth of the
world’s population.
Both of these arguments miss a
more basic point. Simple condem
nation of the present regime in
China is a barren approach to a
complex problem, while recogni
tion of Peking on the basis of its
numerical strength alone has little
more relevance to the question of
world peace. Rather, to judge the
China question, we must antici
pate the effect of accepting Pe
king on Red China itself, as well
as on the United Nations.

tions is a first step toward pro
ducing this involvement. Students
of the U.N. point out a broad
range of areas where contacts are
made between nations at the U.N.
outside of the conference cham
bers as well as in actual debate.
THE CONSTANT participation
of Red China in day-to-day diplo
matic intercourse could have a
moderating influence on her jaun
diced view of the world, thus
strengthening the U.N.’s efforts
for peace.

There is little evidence to sug
gest that Red China’s presence in
the U.N. would materially weaken
that organization, The causes of
international conflict rest outside
of its walls, not within; and the
international situation will degen
erate no more rapidly for having
Red China around to discuss it.
China’s voice in the General As
sembly would be but one out of
101, and her possible veto in the
Security Council would mean rela
tively little on top of the absolute
veto which Russia already wields
there for the Communist bloc.
To accept Red China’s admis
sion to the United Nations is not,
then, to condone any aspect of her
policy, foreign or domestic.
Rather, this acceptance implies
an evaluation of the probable re
sults of her admission and the
feeling that these are likely to
further, rather than hinder, ef
forts toward international under
standing.
Red China should be admitted
to the United Nations. The United
States is committed to avoiding
this, but the inevitable acceptance
by the U.N. of the Communist
regime in China, while a defeat
for this aspect of our foreign
policy, could easily have bene
ficial effects for the cause of
world peace.
The Barry Goldwater fringe in
this country would have us with
draw from the United Nations
when Red China is accepted by
that body. Goldwater said recent
ly, “A loyalty to (the ideals which
the U.N. was formed to serve) re
quires that we work to save the
United Nations by refusing to co
operate with it for so long as it
betrays those ideals.”
IN CONTRAST to this is the
feeling of many that no organiza
tion can claim to be truly inter
national while it excludes repre
sentatives of one-fourth of the
world’s population.
Both of these arguments miss a
more basic point. Simple condem
nation of the present regime in
China is a barren approach to a
complex problem, while recogni
tion of Peking on the basis of its
numerical strength alone has little
more relevance to the question of
world peace. Rather, to judge the
China question, we must antici
pate the effect of accepting Pe
king on Red China itself, as well
as on the United Nations.

China’s apparent militancy is
well known, and her ideological
disputes with Russia have estab
lished her imago as a nation hun
gry for conflict. To a considerable
extent, however, this strident tone
is coupled with a lack of real in
volvement in the world scene.
CHINA SIMPLY does not now
have the economic or military ca
pacity to take as active a part as
does Russia in world affairs.
Words are cheap, and China
lapses into an aggressive frenzy
of verbiage, while Russia does the
actual work of the Communist
bloc.

Chen I, Red China’s vice pre
mier and foreign minister, has
recognized this dependence on ob
jective conditions in talking of
relations with the United States:
“Is it possible for China and the
Soviet Union to agree with each
other in every respect? No, it is
impossible. The U.S. has diplo
matic relations with the U.S.S.R.,
but China has no such relations
with the United States. The Soviet
Union is a member of the United
Nations, but China is not. The
U.S. keeps occupying Taiwan but
no islands off the Soviet coast.”
CHINA’S approach to interna
tional relations is therefore at
least partially a function of those
relations.

Recognizing that China’s atti

tudes are influenced, then, by the
international context, within which
she operates, we should try to
draw her into increasing involve
ment in world affairs. As she is
forced to participate, rather than
simply to talk, her reliance on an
extreme body of theory should
deteriorate and her awareness of
international realities increase.
