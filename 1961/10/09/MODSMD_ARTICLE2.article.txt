# Laotians Choose Souvanna For Compromise Premier
## 
### 
Ban Hin Heup, Laos (UPD
The three rival princes of Laos
agreed yesterday on neutralist
Prince Souvanna Phouma as com
promise premier of Laos.
It was a major step toward end
ing the still smouldering civil war,
but major difficulties still lie
ahead in forming a coalition cab
inet that will include Communist,
neutral and Western-aligned mem
bers.
AGREEMENT ON the pipe
smoking Souvanna was the first
major break in the stalemate on
the princely conferences that be

gan originally in Zurich, Switzer
land. as a parallel development to
the 14-nation conference on Laos.
The Geneva conference was still
stalled by East-West wrangling.
U.S. Ambassador Averell Harri
man arrives in Geneva today and
Western delegates said they would
increase their efforts to get the
Communists to agree on such ma
jor problems as policing the cease
fire in Laos.

MEETING yesterday were Sou
vanna, pr o-Western Premier
Prince Boun Oum and “Red
Prince” Souphanouvong, a half

brother of the new premier and
leader of the Communist Pathet
Lao.

Souvanna, who already consid
ers himself the legal premier and
is recognized by the pro-Commun
ist group as premier has oper
ated out of his “capital” at Xieng
Khouang, which is also Soupha
nouvong’s headquarters.

Boun Oum announced he would
fly today to the Royal capital of
Luang Prabang to clear the way
for King Savang Vathana to make
the formal designation. Souvanna
is expected to follow tomorrow.
SOUVANNA’S aides said the
princes were still stymied over
whether the dominant eight-man
neutral bloc in the ■ 16-man cab
inet should all be drawn from
Souvanna’s followers or should in
clude men who supported neither
(he rebels nor the government.
The princes had agreed earlier
that there would be a 16-man cab
inet made up of four pro-Commun
ists, four pro-Westerners and the
eight-man neutralist bloc. Yester
day they agred that the major
portfolios of national defense
army and interior police would go
to the premier and vice premier.
