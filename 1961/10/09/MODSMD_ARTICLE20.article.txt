## Liquor Ban Repealed in S.F. 
### CARL OLIVER Exchange Editor 
A ban on liquor sales in San
Francisco passed by the California
legislature last year but which
never quite became effective has
been repealed.
The ban resulted from a law ef
fective one year ago that prohibit
ed exposing, giving away or sell
ing alcoholic beverages within a
one and one-half mile radius of
any college or university with an
enrollment of more than 1000 stu
dents and more than 500 living on
campus.
The ban did not apply to any es
tablishment already in business.
COMMENTING on the legisla
tion, State Liquor Director Mal
colm Harris pointed out that cir
cles of a mile and a half radius
covering the University of San
Francisco, the University of Cali
fornia Medical Center and San
Francisco State College covered
too much of San Francisco’s lim
ited area “and just didn’t make
sense.”
The San Francisco dry belt

around the three schools stretch
ed from Portola Drive and
O'Shaughnessy Boulevard in the
south to Greenwich Street in the
north. It covered half of the Pre
sidio and stretched easterly to
Gough Street and westerly to 25th
Avenue.
The California legislature’s re
peal of the liquor-ban in San Fran
cisco was effective Friday, Sept.
15. The old law still affects most
other colleges and universities in
the state.
AT THE University of Kansas,
a brand-new club reached its 500-
member limit after a two-hour
membership drive.
“Why we could have sold 1000
membership cards,” one organizer
said.
The club?—SlP (Students In
terested in Pleasure).
“We’re bringing in some real
cool bands for KU’s big swingers,”
said Robert Sher wood, a charter
member. “When these bands come
here for SIP conventions,” Sher
wood said, “they’ll be wearing
‘zoot suits’ and will put on a real
show. What I mean by show is
that the performers will be danc

ing on the stage, playing guitars
behind their backs and stuff like
that.”
Sherwood says bands will
“swing way out” if they’re offered
more money than usual. A band
that asks $l5O for a home town
engagement will be paid about
$3OO for playing at an SIP con
vention, Sherwood says.

COMMENTING on the legisla
tion, State Liquor Director Mal
colm Harris pointed out that cir
cles of a mile and a half radius
covering the University of San
Francisco, the University of Cali
fornia Medical Center and San
Francisco State College covered
too much of San Francisco’s lim
ited area “and just didn’t make
sense.”
The San Francisco dry belt

around the three schools stretch
ed from Portola Drive and
O'Shaughnessy Boulevard in the
south to Greenwich Street in the
north. It covered half of the Pre
sidio and stretched easterly to
Gough Street and westerly to 25th
Avenue.
The California legislature’s re
peal of the liquor-ban in San Fran
cisco was effective Friday, Sept.
15. The old law still affects most
other colleges and universities in
the state.
AT THE University of Kansas,
a brand-new club reached its 500-
member limit after a two-hour
membership drive.
“Why we could have sold 1000
membership cards,” one organizer
said.
The club?—SlP (Students In
terested in Pleasure).
“We’re bringing in some real
cool bands for KU’s big swingers,”
said Robert Sher wood, a charter
member. “When these bands come
here for SIP conventions,” Sher
wood said, “they’ll be wearing
‘zoot suits’ and will put on a real
show. What I mean by show is
that the performers will be danc

ing on the stage, playing guitars
behind their backs and stuff like
that.”
Sherwood says bands will
“swing way out” if they’re offered
more money than usual. A band
that asks $l5O for a home town
engagement will be paid about
$3OO for playing at an SIP con
vention, Sherwood says.
UNIVERSITY of Washington

ing are 50 classes scheduled to

A ban on liquor sales in San
Francisco passed by the California
legislature last year but which
never quite became effective has
been repealed.
The ban resulted from a law ef
fective one year ago that prohibit
ed exposing, giving away or sell
ing alcoholic beverages within a
one and one-half mile radius of
any college or university with an
enrollment of more than 1000 stu
dents and more than 500 living on
campus.
The ban did not apply to any es
tablishment already in business.
