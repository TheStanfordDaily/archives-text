# Labor Union Talks Today
## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPD—The 29-
member executive council of the
AFL-CIO meets today to tackle
national labor union problems,
topped by the question of what to
do about James L. Hoffa and his
giant Teamster’s union.
There are pressures within the
AFL-CIO on President George
Meany both for re-admission of
the Teamsters booted out in 1957
on charges of corrupt domination

and also for establishment of a
rival Teamsters’ union within the
CIO.
