# Spartans Rout Indians, 31-3
## MSU Erupts For 17 Points in Last Period 
### RON RAPOPORT 
EAST LANSING. Mich.—A vali
ant attempt to shift Stanford’s
victory machine into the high gear
needed to heat Michigan State
failed here Saturday and the In
dians wore throttled, 31-3.
But the Tribe’s surprising de
fensive efforts had the power
laden Spartans talking to them
selves through most of the game
played before 61,367 fans enjoy
ing the cloudless 74-degree weath
er.
NOT UNTIL the fourth quarter
could Michigan State boast of
enough points to insure its up
ward progress in (he national
rankings probably to second or
third place or the win itself, for
that matter.
It was Stanford’s first loss of
the year and breaks a two-game
winning streak, (he longest one
the Tribe has had in four years.
MSU I or Moo U. as it is affection
ately known to a hard core of un
dergraduates) remains unbeaten
and an important contender for
the Big 10 title.
The loss may prove to be of sec
ondary importance to Stanford as
the season progresses, however,
as three first string Indian play
ers were injured in varying de
grees.
LAKBV ROYSE, a senior half
back whose play has been an
early-season sensation, may be
lost for the year with a broken
collar-bone. Also hurt to lesser
degrees were quarterback Steve
Thurlow, end Steve Pursell and
fullback Hal Steuber.
Royse was hit by Ed (Rocky)
Ryan, the Spartan captain, when
returning a second quarter kick
off after MSU’s first touchdown.
Trainer Connie Jarvis says,
“You have to count him out for
the rest of the year.”
PURSELL, a junior and a prime
target for Stanford passes, hurt
his instep and for a while couldn’t
walk. Presently he is hobbling
around, however, and team physi

cian Frederick Behling said that
X-rays will be taken to determine
the extent of the injury.

Thurlow, the only quarterback
who seemed able to make much
progress against the Michigan
State defenses, was sidelined with
a charleyhorse. Jarvis says the
sophomore signal-caller will miss
some practice but may bo ready to
play next ( week.
As for the game itself, there is

much that could, and should, be
said on Stanford’s behalf.
THE INDIAN defense, for the
major portion of the game, was
commendable. It was a long time
before the Spartans got on the
scoreboard and they did it in an
extremely unorthodox manner.

Often during this first part of
the contest MSU would plunge up
the middle on the first two downs
of a series and find itself with a
third down and four yards to go
situation or third and five. The
Spartans would then swep the
end and invariably get the yards
needed for the first down, but
never much more.

Finally, late in the third quar
ter with the score 7-3, it looked
like the Tribe had stopped this
frustrating pattern. State, in the
second period, had finally been
able to put up a drive that result
ed in a touchdown instead of a
fumble or intercepted pass or
punt and Stanford had countered
with a score of its own in the
third quarter; a 40-yard field goal
off the left foot of Stan Lindskog.

LINDSKOG kicked off and on
the first set of downs the Indians
looked like they’d get the ball
again. The Spartans gained eight
yards on the first three plays
from scrimmage (with third and
3 they got 1 up the middle) and
it was fourth down and two yards
to go with the ball on Michigan
State’s 28.

Not to punt was unthinkable.
With a lead of only four points
you wouldn’t give your opponent
even a chance of getting the hall
deep in your own territory. But a
third string right halfback named
Dewy Lewis circled his left end,
got seven yards and the first

down. Six plays later the score
was 14-3.

A few minutes later Stanford
got its last chance. With fourth
down and a yard to go on MSU’s
23, halfback Mike Barnes fumbled,
recovered it himself, but gained
nothing. The Spartans took over.
They scored two touchdowns and
a safety in the last quarter.
THEBE WERE bright spots.
Gary Sargeant was a terror on
defense, several times cutting
down players who only had to get
by him to score. Fullback Ken Ba
bajian twice ran the draw play
beautifully gaining 18 yards, the
most of any Stanford runner.
But general lack of ability to
sustain an offense was the down
fall and Rocky Ryan and his crew
can take a bow.

A somewhat grisly aftermath
was provided when it was learned
the father of Michigan State’s
quarterback died in the stands
during the first half.

PETE SMITH, who did a fine
job at the one questionable spot
in State’s line-up, learned after
the game that his 47-year-old fa
ther, Andy, who had a known
heart condition was dead.


WHAT THEY WERE UP AGAINST
Card quarterback Rod Sears cuts loose under a heavy rush by tackle Dave Herman of the Spartans’
defense-minded second unit. Sears was able to complete three of six but for a total yardage of
seven. The Indians rolled up only 96 yards overall on offense.
