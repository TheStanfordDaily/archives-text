## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford propped for the com
ing Northern California Intercol
legiate Soccer Conference season
with a 3-3 tie against strong Hay
ward United in a practice game
played Saturday at Stanford.
The junior varsity and fresh
men also won. The frosh defeated
Menlo College varsity 5-0, and re
mained undefeated, untied, and
unscored upon. The JV’s shut out
Polytechnic of San Francisco 2-0.
VARSITY GOAKS wore scored
by Mike Ero, Larry Chukwcdebe
and Rune Engecrettson.
After the varsity game, Stan
ford soccer coach, Fred Priddle
said he was happy with the work
of the front line, but dissatisfied
with the defensive backfield, in
particular the work of the goal
keepers.
Priddle singled out substitute
forwards Ero, Sam Edwards, Ed
Clark, and backs Chuck Pofahl,
Bill Hatch, and Don Burr for do
ing creditable work.

Ero took over for all-conference
forward Emmanuel Andah and
scored once. Incidentally, Andah

will not he able to play Friday
night against San Jose State. He
is entering the hospital next week
end for minor surgery.
WINGS Edwards and Clark
played well in reserve of starters
Mike Tippett and Adam Bianchi.
Pofahl replaced fullback Dan Far
thing, after the latter pulled a
muscle. Hatch and Burr split play
ing time at the hotly contested
center-half spot and both played
creditably.

Priddle said that the goalkeep
ing must be improved. The co
ordination needed between the
backs and the goalie was again
lacking and more undeserved
points were scored against the
Tribe.

Hayward United is a tough
team, possibly as tough as Cal,
who won the conference pre-sea
son tournament. That Stanford
tied them, while giving reserves
equal playing time with the first
line, is an encouraging factor. Add
this to the fact that the Cards are
young, improving with every
game, and you get a title con
tending team for Stanford.
