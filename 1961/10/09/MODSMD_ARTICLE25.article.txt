The University of California
Golden Bears, suddenly coming
out of a two-year hibernation,
tangle with the proud Washington
Huskies in the West Coastâ€™s col
lege grid game of the week Sat
urday.
And from their showing against
mighty Missouri, a team they held
to a 14-14 tie, this could be the
first major stumbling block on the
path of the Huskies to a third
straight trip to the Rose Bowl.
Washington, which lost all of its
Rose Bowl starters, came along in
the closing minutes to whip Pitts
burgh, 22-17, in a tense battle at
Seattle.
California, which had been shel
lacked by Texas 28-3 and lowa
28-7, looked like a different team
with Randy Gold at the signal
calling spot. Gold has been side
lined with injuries since the start
of the season.

This will be the only Big Five
League competition of the day.

Southern California continues
its intersectional tour by taking
on Notre Dame in South Bend.
The Trojans put on a fine power
display in losing to lowa, 35-34.
Notre Dame had to come from be
hind to beat Purdue, 22-20.

UCLA also stays on the inter
sectional binge by entertaining
Vanderbilt. Alabama clobbered
the Commodores, 35-6, while the
Bruins were losing a toughie to
Ohio State, 13-3.
