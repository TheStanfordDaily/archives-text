## 'REAL PROUD OF THEM' Cactus Jack Remains Cheerful Despite Lopsided Loss to MSU 
### 
EAST LANSING, Mich. The
Stanford dressing room was per
vaded by an atmosphere of noise
less despair after the Indians’ 31-3
loss to Michigan State here Satur
day.

Coach Jack Curtice stood by the
door and patiently answered the
uninspired questions that report
ers were asking him. Few of the
players said anything. They show
ered and dressed quickly, then
headed for the bus that would
take them back to the motel.
Larry Royse, Stanford’s hard
luck halfback who may be lost for
the season with a broken collar
bone suffered during the game,
was on the verge of tears. With
his arm in a makeshift sling,
Royse paced about in obvious
pain.

“Something popped,” he said.
“One guy hit me as I was return
ing the kick-off and then Ryan
(Rocky Ryan, Michigan State’s
captain) got me. He didn’t hit me
very hard, but something popped.”
Royse sat out last season with a
broken arm.

Assistant coach Andy Everest
mentioned that the cheers that
were piped in from the students
at Frost Amphitheater via tele
phone had come in very clearly.
“The team appreciated it,” Ever
est said.

Curtice was surprisingly cheer
ful.

“I’m real proud of them,” he
said. “The defense was terrific
and they never stopped trying.
They played a hell of a game.”
Curtice enthusiastically singled
out defensive hack Gary Sargeant
for his fine tackling and Frank
Atkinson for exceptional lino play.

"Our biggest problem was mov
ing the ball,” the Stanford head
man complained. “Wo just got
tired at the end.”

To the inevitable, “What do you
think of Michigan State?” query,
Curtice sighed and then gave a
smile reminiscent of a comedian
who had just thought of a good
ad lib.

“They’re pretty good through
the first 33,” said football’s funni
est coach.

That broke up the meeting.
