half, the score being 6-1 at the
midway point. The goal allowed
was a penalty shot by San Jose.

IN THE second half, coach Jim

third strings and goalie Dick Greg

offensively, but slacked off a little
on defense.

It was a very optimistic start
for the Indians, after losing last

mirable job against the State
freshman team as Marty Hull

Jim Andreas teamed to score nine
goals between them. Goalie

defending, allowing only eight
points to bo scored by the frosh
Spartans. Final score:22-8.

ANOTHER frosh game with
Fremont High School gave the
Cards their second victory of the
season, 16-8. Marty Hull was again
the high scorer with six points,
followed by Brian Beck, Dave Gil
