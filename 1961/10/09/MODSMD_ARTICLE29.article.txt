# N.Y. Shuts Out Cincinnati; Ford Cracks Ruth's Mark
## 
### OSCAR FRALEY 
CINCINNATI (UPD- Whitey
Ford scrubbed another of the im
mortal Babe Ruth’s marks from
the record books yesterday as the
New York Yankees chipped away
for a 7 to 0 victory over Cincin
nati and a three games to one lead
in the World Series.
Ford hurled five scoreless inn
ings for a total of 32 consecutive
World Series frames in which he
hasn't given up a run. It erased
Ruth's 43-year-old standard of
29 2-3 innings as the Yankees con
tinued their assault on the record
performances of one of their
greatest heroes.
FORI) retired with an injured
foot after yielding a leadoff single
in the top of the sixth but Jim
Coates came on to retire the side,
keeping Ford’s mark open for fu
ture improvement, and shut the
Reds out the rest of the way on
this bright, sunny day before 32.-
589 fans.
Reds’ handsome starting pitch
er Jim O’Toole, going down to de
feat for the second time, managed
to muffle that vaunted Yankee
home run power as did the two
harried hurlers who followed him
to the hill but the retread Reds
finally lived up to their ragamuf
fin reputation. For they threw the

game away with two failures to
make the double play, an error, a
wild pitch and generally loose,

i listless play.
O’Toole set up his own disgust

Elio Chacon was the last out he
