# Frosh Sharp In Scrimmage
## 
### 
A pleased Coach Dan Stavely
watched his frosh team score
twice on the Junior varsity in the
first series of plays Saturday in
the first frosh-JV scrimmage.

Stavely played all his squads as
the game progressed, scoring
twice more on the JV’s. After the
informal totals were taken, the
freshman eleven was one TD up
on the Braves squad.

The coach was particularly hap
py with the performances of quar
terbacks Dick Ragsdale and Dick
Berg, and also thought his line, a
line that he suspected to be weak,
held up very well against the
Braves. Chappel and Neal the
probable starting guards for the
frosh opener tomorrow both did
an admirable job offensively and
defensively. Tackle John Wilkins,
and co-captain tackle John Wilbur
also looked very well in the frosh
line.
Co-captain Allen Curr, a speedy
half, sparked the frosh backfield
and will also be among tomor
row’s starting lineup.
