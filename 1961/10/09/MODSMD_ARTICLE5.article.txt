Stanford’s radio station, KZSU (880 kilocycles
on AM radio), will begin operation tonight at 7
o’clock with expanded coverage including Roblc,
Florence Moore, Lagunila and Wilbur Halls.
The sta-ion will be on the air Monday through
Friday and will broadcast the Stanford football
games on Saturday afternoons. Although KZSU
may soon start afternoon broadcasts, it will oper
ate only from 7 p.m. until midnight for the next
few weeks.
KZSU WILL play music for most of the evening
with regular newscasts and special programs sup
plementing the music.
Before 10 p.m. the station will present mostly
jazz and popular music while classical music will
be played from 10:30 p.m. until midnight. On Mon
days Dave Barnum will present “Music Ameri
cana,” a program devoted to folk music, from
8:30 until 10 p.m.
15-minute newscasts will be broadcast at 7
and 10 o’clock nightly, with national and state news
from the UPI and with special attention to local
campus news. At 10:15 every evening, KZSU will
present sports news with nationwide coverage
But with emphasis again on Stanford sports with
comments from coaches and players.
EVERY MONDAY and Thursday nights from
7:15 to 7:30, a graduate student, John Raser, will

from San Diego State and completed graduate
work at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy
;d Tufts.

Other special programs will include debates,
discussions, and lectures sponsored by Political
Union. The Institute for International Relations
will also present special programs.
According to Asa Fulton, Station Manager of
KZSU, reception is known to be good in Toyon,
Branner, Crothers, Roble, Lagunita and Florence
Moore. With the aid of a new transmitter installed
yesterday in Wilbur Hall, freshmen should get
better reception than in previous years.
ON THE ROW, most fraternities can receive
KZSU from the transmitters located in the ATO,
Deke and Sigma Chi houses. Fulton would appre
ciate people’s calling him from all over the campus
at DA 5-0880 to tell him how clear their reception is.
KZSU, although staffed by students, is owned
by the University and is technically an experi
mental laboratory for the Department of Speech
and Drama. The station supports itself financially
by its advertising and by selling the recordings it
makes of the Spring Sing, Gaieties and other
special events. Its budget approximates $4,000
annually.
IN 1958 the Dean’s office put KZSU off the air
after the F.C.C. had given the station several
warnings that its power was too high and that its
signals were interfering with the reception of the
local commercial radio stations. The station went
on the air again the following year in compliance
with F.C.C. regulations.
KZSU is not broadcast in the usual sense by
radio waves. Rather, the station’s signal is carried
along the electrical wires in each building.
