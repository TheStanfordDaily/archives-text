# $1.2 Million Ford Grant To Stanford
## 
### 
The Ford Foundation has made
a grant of $1.2 million to Stan
ford to strengthen graduate train
ing in chemical engineering and
materials science, the Foundation
announced yesterday in New
York.

The new funds supplement a
previous grant of $3.4 million to
Stanford’s Engineering School
made by the Ford Foundation in
July, 1960.

THE GRANT will bo used main
ly for term support of four new
senior professorships two each
in the departments of chemical
engineering and materials sci
ence. which recently joined the
administrative structure of the
Engineering School.
In chemical engineering, the
new foundation grant will help
Stanford expand in the fields of
transport theory, solid state
chemistry, and polymer chemis
try. Within five years, the Uni
versity expects io rank near the
top nationally in advanced de
grees conferred in chemical en
gineering.
SINCE 1935 Stanford has
tripled the size of its faculty in
physical metallurgy (from two
to six) and student enrollment
in this field has increased seven
fold (from 10 to 70). As the scope
of physical metallurgy has broad
ened to include non-metallic ma
terials, this field has become
known as “materials science.”

The Ford Foundation grant will
help Stanford expand its senior
faculty in such specific fields as
the mechanical behavior of non
metallic materials, reaction kine
tics in non-metallic materials, and
structural imperfections in semi
conductors and insulators.

The Ford Foundation grant to
the Engineering School is com
pletely separate from the five
year PACE program.
