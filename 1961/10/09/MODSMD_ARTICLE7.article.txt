# First New Frat Unit Completion Slated For Spring Quarter
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Editor 
Fraternity men will begin the
move off The Row and into the
new housing complex behind Flor
ence Moore Hall next spring quar
ter, University officials report.
L. F. Stark, construction man
ager in the University’s Business
Office, says the target date for
completion of the first four

houses is April 15. Construction ,
got underway last spring quarter.
David S. Larimer, assistant dean
of men handling fraternity af
fairs, expects the new houses to
“bo occupied next spring quarter.”
THE FIRST four houses to
move into the $1,630,000 project
will ho Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Phi
Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma and
Theta Delta Chi.
Royal Tyson of the Business Of
fice reports the second group of
four houses is in the working
drawing stage and the schedule
calls for occupancy in the spring
of 1963. Officials originally had
hoped to break ground for the
second group by Dec. 1, with occu
pancy in the fall of 1962.
Scheduled to move into the sec
ond group are the Zeta Psi, Alpha
Delta Phi, Alpha Kappa Lambda
and Kappa Alpha houses.
WHEN the first Greeks do move
into the new housing, it will sig
nal the start of a shift planned
several years ago, and one which
—like Tresidder, the new post of
fice and bookstore—had ben ex
pected to start before now.
In 1958, The Daily quoted Uni
vei’.sity officials as expecting con
struction on the first project to
start in 1959, with “occupancy by
September 1960.”
The move this spring will lead
off a phasing process of eventual
ly placing Stanford’s 24 fraterni
ties in four-house groups behind
Florence Moore, in back of Lake
Lagunita and behind Wilbur Hall.
THE FIRST four houses are
going in because they raised the
necessary funds first, Larimer
said. He notes that some of the
“houses are really worn out.”
Stanford will buy the vacated
houses and use them for as yet
undetermined purposes.
Some are in such poor condition
that they undoubtedly will be
torn down, while others probably
will be turned into research cen
ters such as Hispanic-American
Studies’ Bolivar House.
“ONE HOUSE probably will be
used to house the Fijls,” Larimer
expects. The houseless Phi Gam
ma Delta’s currently are in Stan
ford Village.
The groups of four houses orig
inally were tabbed “clusters” be
cause they clustered around a
central kitchen which was planned
to serve all four houses.
The term “cluster” may not be
applicable now. as the central
kitchen has been eliminated from
the plans because of high bids sub
mitted by contractors and the

limited amount of money avail
able for the project.
THIS will not make a big dif
ference, as the smaller kitchens
planned for each house had grown
so large as plans progressed that
one adequate to take care of all of
