BJ1@©(2)KI H ° How to recognize a girl
It is not surprising, in these days of constantly changing
fashion standards, that girls are often mistaken for men.
Certain popular items of apparel, such as slacks,
baggy sweaters and boxy suits, contribute to this un
fortunate situation. Therefore, we suggest that new
students of girl watching start with the fundamentals
(see above diagram). As you can sec, girls arc easiest
to identify from the side. However, even the beginner
will soon achieve proficiency from front and rear as well.
Advanced students can usually tell a girl from a man
at five hundred paces, even when both arc wearing
asbestos firefighting suits. (You might try offering the
subject a Pall Mall, but you won’t prove anything. It’s
an extremely popular brand with both sexes.)
