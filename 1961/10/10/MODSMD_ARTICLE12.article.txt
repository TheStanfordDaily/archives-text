# 'Gastly' At New Union
## 
### 
There was this bulldozer,
see. It was out in front of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium work
ing on the new Union. Well, it
ran into this gas main. And
broke it. And gas started com
ing up. It was very noisy.
And dangerous.
The fire department came
and stopped the gas. Aren’t
you glad we didn’t say things
like, “Take gas?” Or, “It was
a real gasser?”
