# U.S. Reds Prepare To Defy Court Over Registration Order
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP!) The
Communist Party in the United
States yesterday lost its fight in
the Supreme Court to keep from
registering as an agent of the
Soviet Union.

Communist leaders promptly
declared they would defy the
court’s order and Atty. Gen. Rob
ert F. Kennedy announced the
government was ready to prose
cute them if they did. If convicted,
the Communist officials would
face a five-year jail term.
The high court dealt with the
case on its first working day of
the fall session. In a brief order,
it refused to re-examine its June
5 ruling that the Communist Par
ty, U.S.A., must register as a con
spiracy agent of the Soviet Union.
The Subversive Activities Con
trol Board has ordered the party
to register with the Justice De
partment three times. But each
time, appeals permitted a re
prieve.

KENNEDY said in a statement
that the party has now “exhaust
ed its last legal recourse” in its
fight against registration. He said
“we will enforce the law.”
Kennedy said that 10 days after
the court issues its formal order—

expected in a few days—the regis
tration rule becomes final.
Then, he said, within the follow
ing 30 days the party must regis
ter and file with the Justice De
partment a list of the names and
addresses of its officers and mem
bers during the past year, an ac
counting of its finances and a list
of printing presses owned or con
trolled by the party or its mem
bers.

THE I*ARTY' faces a $lO,OOO
fine for each day of non-compli
ance after the deadline. The offi
cers and members face the same,
plus live years in jail.
In addition to the ruling on the
party, the court also;

• Agreed to hear an appeal by
a Negro leader in Memphis, Tenn.,
who is protesting racial segrega
tion in restaurant and rest room
facilities of the Memphis Munici
pal Airport. The case was brought
by Jesse Turner, executive vice
president and cashier of a bank
and a member of the executive
committee of the Shelby County
Democratic Party.

• REFUSED for (he time being
to decide whether federal law per
mits a state to ban the “agency
shop,” a modified form of a union
shop. The case originated in Kan
sas. Under an agency shop con
tract, a non-union worker must
pay the union a sum equal to dues
and assessments to keep his job.
• Turned down three appeals in
which Louisiana authorities had
lost school desegregation cases in
lower courts. The lower courts
had upheld orders to end segre
gation in various school districts
in the state.

• Refused to reconsider its de
cision of last May 29 which up
held the constitutionality of Penn
sylvania’s “blue laws” ordering
Sunday closing.
