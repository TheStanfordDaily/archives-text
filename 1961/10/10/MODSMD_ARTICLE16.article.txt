Editor, The Daily:
In the Sept. 29 Daily, you ran an
editorial and an article against
civil defense. I have just com
pleted a two-week study of civil
defense plans, both national and
California, for the Associated
Press, and I think both editorial
and article are based on lack of
knowledge of the facts.
Both you and Mr. Greenberg ar
gue that (1) very little of our
way of life can survive a nuclear
war, and (2) the little that would
remain is not worth fighting for.
“Democracy cannot flourish in
a sea of economic and social back
wardness,” writes Mr. Greenberg.
Perhaps not. But although the
United States may be wildly dis
organized by an all-out nuclear
war, it will always have one ad
vantage that countries normally
thought of as socially and econ
omically backward lack—the ex
perience and ideals gained after
185 years of democratic life.
From this it can rebuild.
“Democracy, like a rare tropical
plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow.” Not so,
Mr. Greenberg. It needs people
willing to make it grow. And
given these, it proves a pretty
hardy plant.
The federal government has pre
pared a national plan for civil de
fense. This two-inch thick series
of pamphlets outlines the function
of each government agency in an
emergency, from keeping the
peace to emergency economic
stabilization to decontamination
after the fact. The state of Cali
fornia has a similar plan. The
plans are there. The pity is that
no one knows about them.
Monday’s Herblock was a good
QD&r-a man groping in a dense
fog of civil defense questions. Peo
ple have heard so many stories
about the horrors of THE BOMB
that they don’t know what to be
lieve. As a result, they refuse to
think about the problem, become
convinced that a nuclear war can
never come, or are convinced that
the world won’t be worth living in
after THE BOMB is dropped.
A nuclear war IS possible. Civil
defense IS effective. This is the
first time in history that man has
the potential to make a tinderbox
of the world. But, relatively
speaking, it is NOT the first time
a crisis of this magnitude has oc
curred. And I see no reason for
thinking that survivors of a nu
clear disaster will be any lower
form of life than those that sur
vived world wars or plagues.
Civil defense is not complicated,
but it is shrouded in mystery,
myth and half-baked ideas. Usual
ly, as in any other undertaking,
the crackpots get a large propor
tion of the publicity.
But if individuals take the trou
ble to investigate and talk to peo
ple who should know the facts,
they will realize that there is more
to be gained by thoughtful plan
ning with an eye to what could
happen, than by throwing up their
hands and saying “I quit.”
Austin Scott
Editor, The Daily:
The issue of India's neutrality
has been raised by Sally McCoy,
who seems to hold the somewhat
mistaken notion that neutrality
means pro-Western.
Miss McCoy has cited India’s
voting record in the U.N. On one
occasion she states that India ab
stained when Russia accused us of
spying (during the U-2 incident),
insinuating that this is anti-
Western. It is difficult for me to
understand this assumption, when
our government admits that is
exactly what we were doing.
It seems incredible that she
could single out Nehru’s state
ments at Belgrade as hostile when
he was the one leader to openly
attack the Soviet resumption of
nuclear testing. I certainly can
not agree with India’s stand on
some issues, but then I am sure
Nikita could not either.
There are some countries in the
U.N. which almost invariably vote
with the U.S.; countries such as
Paraguay and Nicaragua, which
suffer the yoke of oppressive dic
tatorship. The government of In
dia, while not aligning itself in
the Cold War, has shown itself
dedicated to Western democratic
principles.
This dedication to enlightened
government and the welfare of

the Indian people, impresses me
much more than a vote in the
U.N., which can, or could, be
bought from a Somoza, or Batista
for the price of a few military
weapons.

India is the largest and one of
the most enlightened of the un
committed nations. This is why I
would like to see her, rather than
Nationalist China or Red China,
on the Security Council.

Editor, The Daily:
I want to thank The Daily for
the able and extensive coverage it
has given the Peace Corps. The
Daily has very articulately pre
sented the point that I attempted
to make in my speech last week,
that is, that, man-for-man, Stan
ford has probably more to offer
the Peace Corps than any other
University, because such a signi
ficant portion of the student body
has had overseas experience.
There is just one correction I
want to make on the coverage of
my speech. The report mentioned
that I had said that there was a
total of 19 college graduates in
Ghana when it reached its inde
pendence. In fact, the country that
I alluded to was the former Bel
gian Congo. This had better be
said for the record, lest Ghana
students and former British co
lonial administrators zero in on
me.
Peter Grothe
Editor, The Daily:
To my great surprise, I find
that my remarks during last Fri
day night’s International Center
discussion of the Katanga issue
have been interpreted by those
present to mean quite the opposite
of what I intended. I would like to
take this chance to make my posi
tion clear to these people.
I have been told that I was un
derstood to «ay that the Africans
are not ready for self-government,
and that the United Nations
should assume control of the Con
go. This is not my position.
I merely intended to say that
since the United Nations has been
working on the assumption that
the Congolese are ready for self
government (my opinion also),
since it was the conclusion of
those present at the discussion
that the Katanga province was of
necessity a part of the Congo na
tion, and since the U.N.’s present
action had only aggravated the
civil war in the Congo; then the
U.N.’s proper action should be to
intervene by force in all of the
Congo so as to prepare for demo
cratic elections which would de
cide the proper government of the
Congo.
When I advised that before elec
tions the U.N. should enforce a
breathing time, during which the
various sides in the Congo dispute
could present their opinions to the
people, I did not in any way mean
that the U.N. should exercise a
permanent mandate.
In fact, if those present had
bothered to listen to the rest of
my remarks, they would have
heard me say that the U.N. could
not enforce such a mandate be
cause the Congolese (and the rest
of Africa) are sick and tired of
external interference in their af
fairs.
I hope that this letter makes my
position clear to my African
friends, since I do not like to be
thought of as a colonialist.
I also hope that in the future,
unlike Friday night, I shall be al
lowed by the moderator of a dis
cussion in which I participate to
explain my views fully enough so
as to prevent this ridiculous mis
understanding from happening
again.

fornia has a similar plan. The
plans are there. The pity is that
no one knows about them.
Monday’s Herblock was a good
QD&r-a man groping in a dense
fog of civil defense questions. Peo
ple have heard so many stories
about the horrors of THE BOMB
that they don’t know what to be
lieve. As a result, they refuse to
think about the problem, become
convinced that a nuclear war can
never come, or are convinced that
the world won’t be worth living in
after THE BOMB is dropped.
A nuclear war IS possible. Civil
defense IS effective. This is the
first time in history that man has
the potential to make a tinderbox
of the world. But, relatively
speaking, it is NOT the first time
a crisis of this magnitude has oc
curred. And I see no reason for
thinking that survivors of a nu
clear disaster will be any lower
form of life than those that sur
vived world wars or plagues.
Civil defense is not complicated,
but it is shrouded in mystery,
myth and half-baked ideas. Usual
ly, as in any other undertaking,
the crackpots get a large propor
tion of the publicity.
But if individuals take the trou
ble to investigate and talk to peo
ple who should know the facts,
they will realize that there is more
to be gained by thoughtful plan
ning with an eye to what could
happen, than by throwing up their
hands and saying “I quit.”
Austin Scott
Editor, The Daily:
The issue of India's neutrality
has been raised by Sally McCoy,
who seems to hold the somewhat
mistaken notion that neutrality
means pro-Western.
Miss McCoy has cited India’s
voting record in the U.N. On one
occasion she states that India ab
stained when Russia accused us of
spying (during the U-2 incident),
insinuating that this is anti-
Western. It is difficult for me to
understand this assumption, when
our government admits that is
exactly what we were doing.
It seems incredible that she
could single out Nehru’s state
ments at Belgrade as hostile when
he was the one leader to openly
attack the Soviet resumption of
nuclear testing. I certainly can
not agree with India’s stand on
some issues, but then I am sure
Nikita could not either.
There are some countries in the
U.N. which almost invariably vote
with the U.S.; countries such as
Paraguay and Nicaragua, which
suffer the yoke of oppressive dic
tatorship. The government of In
dia, while not aligning itself in
the Cold War, has shown itself
dedicated to Western democratic
principles.
This dedication to enlightened
government and the welfare of

the Indian people, impresses me
much more than a vote in the
U.N., which can, or could, be
bought from a Somoza, or Batista
for the price of a few military
weapons.

India is the largest and one of
the most enlightened of the un
committed nations. This is why I
would like to see her, rather than
Nationalist China or Red China,
on the Security Council.

I want to thank The Daily for
the able and extensive coverage it
has given the Peace Corps. The
Daily has very articulately pre
sented the point that I attempted
to make in my speech last week,
that is, that, man-for-man, Stan
ford has probably more to offer
the Peace Corps than any other
University, because such a signi
ficant portion of the student body
has had overseas experience.
There is just one correction I
want to make on the coverage of
my speech. The report mentioned
that I had said that there was a
total of 19 college graduates in
Ghana when it reached its inde
pendence. In fact, the country that
I alluded to was the former Bel
gian Congo. This had better be
said for the record, lest Ghana
students and former British co
lonial administrators zero in on
me.
Peter Grothe
Editor, The Daily:
To my great surprise, I find
that my remarks during last Fri
day night’s International Center
discussion of the Katanga issue
have been interpreted by those
present to mean quite the opposite
of what I intended. I would like to
take this chance to make my posi
tion clear to these people.
I have been told that I was un
derstood to «ay that the Africans
are not ready for self-government,
and that the United Nations
should assume control of the Con
go. This is not my position.
I merely intended to say that
since the United Nations has been
working on the assumption that
the Congolese are ready for self
government (my opinion also),
since it was the conclusion of
those present at the discussion
that the Katanga province was of
necessity a part of the Congo na
tion, and since the U.N.’s present
action had only aggravated the
civil war in the Congo; then the
U.N.’s proper action should be to
intervene by force in all of the
Congo so as to prepare for demo
cratic elections which would de
cide the proper government of the
Congo.
When I advised that before elec
tions the U.N. should enforce a
breathing time, during which the
various sides in the Congo dispute
could present their opinions to the
people, I did not in any way mean
that the U.N. should exercise a
permanent mandate.
In fact, if those present had
bothered to listen to the rest of
my remarks, they would have
heard me say that the U.N. could
not enforce such a mandate be
cause the Congolese (and the rest
of Africa) are sick and tired of
external interference in their af
fairs.
I hope that this letter makes my
position clear to my African
friends, since I do not like to be
thought of as a colonialist.
I also hope that in the future,
unlike Friday night, I shall be al
lowed by the moderator of a dis
cussion in which I participate to
explain my views fully enough so
as to prevent this ridiculous mis
understanding from happening
again.
Leon Gleser
Editor, The Daily:
In the Sept. 29 Daily, you ran an
editorial and an article against
civil defense. I have just com
pleted a two-week study of civil
defense plans, both national and
California, for the Associated
Press, and I think both editorial
and article are based on lack of
knowledge of the facts.
Both you and Mr. Greenberg ar
gue that (1) very little of our
way of life can survive a nuclear
war, and (2) the little that would
remain is not worth fighting for.
“Democracy cannot flourish in
a sea of economic and social back
wardness,” writes Mr. Greenberg.
Perhaps not. But although the
United States may be wildly dis
organized by an all-out nuclear
war, it will always have one ad
vantage that countries normally
thought of as socially and econ
omically backward lack—the ex
perience and ideals gained after
185 years of democratic life.
From this it can rebuild.
“Democracy, like a rare tropical
plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow.” Not so,
Mr. Greenberg. It needs people
willing to make it grow. And
given these, it proves a pretty
hardy plant.
The federal government has pre
pared a national plan for civil de
fense. This two-inch thick series
of pamphlets outlines the function
of each government agency in an
emergency, from keeping the
peace to emergency economic
stabilization to decontamination
after the fact. The state of Cali
fornia has a similar plan. The
plans are there. The pity is that
no one knows about them.

Editor, The Daily:
The issue of India's neutrality
has been raised by Sally McCoy,
who seems to hold the somewhat
mistaken notion that neutrality
means pro-Western.
Miss McCoy has cited India’s
voting record in the U.N. On one
occasion she states that India ab
stained when Russia accused us of
spying (during the U-2 incident),
insinuating that this is anti-
Western. It is difficult for me to
understand this assumption, when
our government admits that is
exactly what we were doing.
It seems incredible that she
could single out Nehru’s state
ments at Belgrade as hostile when
he was the one leader to openly
attack the Soviet resumption of
nuclear testing. I certainly can
not agree with India’s stand on
some issues, but then I am sure
Nikita could not either.
There are some countries in the
U.N. which almost invariably vote
with the U.S.; countries such as
Paraguay and Nicaragua, which
suffer the yoke of oppressive dic
tatorship. The government of In
dia, while not aligning itself in
the Cold War, has shown itself
dedicated to Western democratic
principles.
This dedication to enlightened
government and the welfare of

the Indian people, impresses me
much more than a vote in the
U.N., which can, or could, be
bought from a Somoza, or Batista
for the price of a few military
weapons.

India is the largest and one of
the most enlightened of the un
committed nations. This is why I
would like to see her, rather than
Nationalist China or Red China,
on the Security Council.

I want to thank The Daily for
the able and extensive coverage it
has given the Peace Corps. The
Daily has very articulately pre
sented the point that I attempted
to make in my speech last week,
that is, that, man-for-man, Stan
ford has probably more to offer
the Peace Corps than any other
University, because such a signi
ficant portion of the student body
has had overseas experience.
There is just one correction I
want to make on the coverage of
my speech. The report mentioned
that I had said that there was a
total of 19 college graduates in
Ghana when it reached its inde
pendence. In fact, the country that
I alluded to was the former Bel
gian Congo. This had better be
said for the record, lest Ghana
students and former British co
lonial administrators zero in on
me.
Peter Grothe
Editor, The Daily:
To my great surprise, I find
that my remarks during last Fri
day night’s International Center
discussion of the Katanga issue
have been interpreted by those
present to mean quite the opposite
of what I intended. I would like to
take this chance to make my posi
tion clear to these people.
I have been told that I was un
derstood to «ay that the Africans
are not ready for self-government,
and that the United Nations
should assume control of the Con
go. This is not my position.
I merely intended to say that
since the United Nations has been
working on the assumption that
the Congolese are ready for self
government (my opinion also),
since it was the conclusion of
those present at the discussion
that the Katanga province was of
necessity a part of the Congo na
tion, and since the U.N.’s present
action had only aggravated the
civil war in the Congo; then the
U.N.’s proper action should be to
intervene by force in all of the
Congo so as to prepare for demo
cratic elections which would de
cide the proper government of the
Congo.
When I advised that before elec
tions the U.N. should enforce a
breathing time, during which the
various sides in the Congo dispute
could present their opinions to the
people, I did not in any way mean
that the U.N. should exercise a
permanent mandate.
In fact, if those present had
bothered to listen to the rest of
my remarks, they would have
heard me say that the U.N. could
not enforce such a mandate be
cause the Congolese (and the rest
of Africa) are sick and tired of
external interference in their af
fairs.
I hope that this letter makes my
position clear to my African
friends, since I do not like to be
thought of as a colonialist.
I also hope that in the future,
unlike Friday night, I shall be al
lowed by the moderator of a dis
cussion in which I participate to
explain my views fully enough so
as to prevent this ridiculous mis
understanding from happening
again.
Leon Gleser
Editor, The Daily:
In the Sept. 29 Daily, you ran an
editorial and an article against
civil defense. I have just com
pleted a two-week study of civil
defense plans, both national and
California, for the Associated
Press, and I think both editorial
and article are based on lack of
knowledge of the facts.
Both you and Mr. Greenberg ar
gue that (1) very little of our
way of life can survive a nuclear
war, and (2) the little that would
remain is not worth fighting for.
“Democracy cannot flourish in
a sea of economic and social back
wardness,” writes Mr. Greenberg.
Perhaps not. But although the
United States may be wildly dis
organized by an all-out nuclear
war, it will always have one ad
vantage that countries normally
thought of as socially and econ
omically backward lack—the ex
perience and ideals gained after
185 years of democratic life.
From this it can rebuild.
“Democracy, like a rare tropical
plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow.” Not so,
Mr. Greenberg. It needs people
willing to make it grow. And
given these, it proves a pretty
hardy plant.
The federal government has pre
pared a national plan for civil de
fense. This two-inch thick series
of pamphlets outlines the function
of each government agency in an
emergency, from keeping the
peace to emergency economic
stabilization to decontamination
after the fact. The state of Cali
fornia has a similar plan. The
plans are there. The pity is that
no one knows about them.
Monday’s Herblock was a good
QD&r-a man groping in a dense
fog of civil defense questions. Peo
ple have heard so many stories
about the horrors of THE BOMB
that they don’t know what to be
lieve. As a result, they refuse to
think about the problem, become
convinced that a nuclear war can
never come, or are convinced that
the world won’t be worth living in
after THE BOMB is dropped.
A nuclear war IS possible. Civil
defense IS effective. This is the
first time in history that man has
the potential to make a tinderbox
of the world. But, relatively
speaking, it is NOT the first time
a crisis of this magnitude has oc
curred. And I see no reason for
thinking that survivors of a nu
clear disaster will be any lower
form of life than those that sur
vived world wars or plagues.
Civil defense is not complicated,
but it is shrouded in mystery,
myth and half-baked ideas. Usual
ly, as in any other undertaking,
the crackpots get a large propor
tion of the publicity.
But if individuals take the trou
ble to investigate and talk to peo
ple who should know the facts,
they will realize that there is more
to be gained by thoughtful plan
ning with an eye to what could
happen, than by throwing up their
hands and saying “I quit.”

Editor, The Daily:
I want to thank The Daily for
the able and extensive coverage it
has given the Peace Corps. The
Daily has very articulately pre
sented the point that I attempted
to make in my speech last week,
that is, that, man-for-man, Stan
ford has probably more to offer
the Peace Corps than any other
University, because such a signi
ficant portion of the student body
has had overseas experience.
There is just one correction I
want to make on the coverage of
my speech. The report mentioned
that I had said that there was a
total of 19 college graduates in
Ghana when it reached its inde
pendence. In fact, the country that
I alluded to was the former Bel
gian Congo. This had better be
said for the record, lest Ghana
students and former British co
lonial administrators zero in on
me.
Peter Grothe
Editor, The Daily:
To my great surprise, I find
that my remarks during last Fri
day night’s International Center
discussion of the Katanga issue
have been interpreted by those
present to mean quite the opposite
of what I intended. I would like to
take this chance to make my posi
tion clear to these people.
I have been told that I was un
derstood to «ay that the Africans
are not ready for self-government,
and that the United Nations
should assume control of the Con
go. This is not my position.
I merely intended to say that
since the United Nations has been
working on the assumption that
the Congolese are ready for self
government (my opinion also),
since it was the conclusion of
those present at the discussion
that the Katanga province was of
necessity a part of the Congo na
tion, and since the U.N.’s present
action had only aggravated the
civil war in the Congo; then the
U.N.’s proper action should be to
intervene by force in all of the
Congo so as to prepare for demo
cratic elections which would de
cide the proper government of the
Congo.
When I advised that before elec
tions the U.N. should enforce a
breathing time, during which the
various sides in the Congo dispute
could present their opinions to the
people, I did not in any way mean
that the U.N. should exercise a
permanent mandate.
In fact, if those present had
bothered to listen to the rest of
my remarks, they would have
heard me say that the U.N. could
not enforce such a mandate be
cause the Congolese (and the rest
of Africa) are sick and tired of
external interference in their af
fairs.
I hope that this letter makes my
position clear to my African
friends, since I do not like to be
thought of as a colonialist.
I also hope that in the future,
unlike Friday night, I shall be al
lowed by the moderator of a dis
cussion in which I participate to
explain my views fully enough so
as to prevent this ridiculous mis
understanding from happening
again.
Leon Gleser
Editor, The Daily:
In the Sept. 29 Daily, you ran an
editorial and an article against
civil defense. I have just com
pleted a two-week study of civil
defense plans, both national and
California, for the Associated
Press, and I think both editorial
and article are based on lack of
knowledge of the facts.
Both you and Mr. Greenberg ar
gue that (1) very little of our
way of life can survive a nuclear
war, and (2) the little that would
remain is not worth fighting for.
“Democracy cannot flourish in
a sea of economic and social back
wardness,” writes Mr. Greenberg.
Perhaps not. But although the
United States may be wildly dis
organized by an all-out nuclear
war, it will always have one ad
vantage that countries normally
thought of as socially and econ
omically backward lack—the ex
perience and ideals gained after
185 years of democratic life.
From this it can rebuild.
“Democracy, like a rare tropical
plant, needs an especially ideal
climate in which to grow.” Not so,
Mr. Greenberg. It needs people
willing to make it grow. And
given these, it proves a pretty
hardy plant.
The federal government has pre
pared a national plan for civil de
fense. This two-inch thick series
of pamphlets outlines the function
of each government agency in an
emergency, from keeping the
peace to emergency economic
stabilization to decontamination
after the fact. The state of Cali
fornia has a similar plan. The
plans are there. The pity is that
no one knows about them.
Monday’s Herblock was a good
QD&r-a man groping in a dense
fog of civil defense questions. Peo
ple have heard so many stories
about the horrors of THE BOMB
that they don’t know what to be
lieve. As a result, they refuse to
think about the problem, become
convinced that a nuclear war can
never come, or are convinced that
the world won’t be worth living in
after THE BOMB is dropped.
A nuclear war IS possible. Civil
defense IS effective. This is the
first time in history that man has
the potential to make a tinderbox
of the world. But, relatively
speaking, it is NOT the first time
a crisis of this magnitude has oc
curred. And I see no reason for
thinking that survivors of a nu
clear disaster will be any lower
form of life than those that sur
vived world wars or plagues.
Civil defense is not complicated,
but it is shrouded in mystery,
myth and half-baked ideas. Usual
ly, as in any other undertaking,
the crackpots get a large propor
tion of the publicity.
But if individuals take the trou
ble to investigate and talk to peo
ple who should know the facts,
they will realize that there is more
to be gained by thoughtful plan
ning with an eye to what could
happen, than by throwing up their
hands and saying “I quit.”
Austin Scott
Editor, The Daily:
The issue of India's neutrality
has been raised by Sally McCoy,
who seems to hold the somewhat
mistaken notion that neutrality
means pro-Western.
Miss McCoy has cited India’s
voting record in the U.N. On one
occasion she states that India ab
stained when Russia accused us of
spying (during the U-2 incident),
insinuating that this is anti-
Western. It is difficult for me to
understand this assumption, when
our government admits that is
exactly what we were doing.
It seems incredible that she
could single out Nehru’s state
ments at Belgrade as hostile when
he was the one leader to openly
attack the Soviet resumption of
nuclear testing. I certainly can
not agree with India’s stand on
some issues, but then I am sure
Nikita could not either.
There are some countries in the
U.N. which almost invariably vote
with the U.S.; countries such as
Paraguay and Nicaragua, which
suffer the yoke of oppressive dic
tatorship. The government of In
dia, while not aligning itself in
the Cold War, has shown itself
dedicated to Western democratic
principles.
This dedication to enlightened
government and the welfare of

the Indian people, impresses me
much more than a vote in the
U.N., which can, or could, be
bought from a Somoza, or Batista
for the price of a few military
weapons.

India is the largest and one of
the most enlightened of the un
committed nations. This is why I
would like to see her, rather than
Nationalist China or Red China,
on the Security Council.

should assume control of the Con
go. This is not my position.
I merely intended to say that
since the United Nations has been
working on the assumption that
the Congolese are ready for self
government (my opinion also),
since it was the conclusion of
those present at the discussion
that the Katanga province was of
necessity a part of the Congo na
tion, and since the U.N.’s present
action had only aggravated the
civil war in the Congo; then the
U.N.’s proper action should be to
intervene by force in all of the
Congo so as to prepare for demo
cratic elections which would de
cide the proper government of the
Congo.
When I advised that before elec
tions the U.N. should enforce a
breathing time, during which the
various sides in the Congo dispute
could present their opinions to the
people, I did not in any way mean
that the U.N. should exercise a
permanent mandate.
In fact, if those present had
bothered to listen to the rest of
my remarks, they would have
heard me say that the U.N. could
not enforce such a mandate be
cause the Congolese (and the rest
of Africa) are sick and tired of
external interference in their af
fairs.
I hope that this letter makes my
position clear to my African
friends, since I do not like to be
thought of as a colonialist.
I also hope that in the future,
unlike Friday night, I shall be al
lowed by the moderator of a dis
cussion in which I participate to
explain my views fully enough so
as to prevent this ridiculous mis
understanding from happening
again.
