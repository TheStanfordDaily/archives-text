Editor, The Daily:
In his letter yesterday, Mr. Da
vid Quarles objected to A-Phi-O’s
“peddling Time magazine at the
entrance of Mem And’’ during
registration. He is apparently un
aware of three important factors:
1. The “omnipresent subscrip
tion blank,” the notices from the
University, Public Exercises, Con
cert Series, etc. were all placed
in his social calendar and handed
to him by members of A-Phi-O.
(If he is interested in this pro
cedure, Mr. Quarles is invited to
help the A-Phi-O men “stuff” 10,-
000 sochtl calendars next quarter.)
In passing out the various reg
materials, A-Phi-O saves the Uni
versity money formerly spent on
paid help.
2. A-Phi-O is a service organiza
tion, Its many projects, from spon
soring a Scout troop in the Con
Home to building and painting
Daily boxes, all require money.
In earning this money, the
members of A-Phi-O perform
another service to the Stanford
student by making Time, Life, and
Sports Illustrated magazines
available at a substantial student
discount.

3. Each year A-Phi-O gives a
hall tuition scholarship financed
entirely by the sale of the afore
mentioned magazines. This schol
arship does not go to an A-Phi-O
member as was recently reported
in The Daily.
It is given to a junior or senior

who has shown leadership in stu
dent affairs chosen by the Uni
versity. One of the recent winners
was an ASSU president.
I would like to thank Mr.
Quarles for pointing out that the
Bookstore is now competing with
A-Phi-O. Subscriptions on the
Bookstore’s blanks do not sup
port local service projects and do

not contribute to a Stanford schol
arship.
Anyone interested in subscrib
ing to any of Mr. Luce’s publica
tions at student rates is urged to
contact Alpha Phi Omega at Box
3058. The “rake-off” will be used
for the benefit of the Stanford
community.

who has shown leadership in stu
dent affairs chosen by the Uni
versity. One of the recent winners
was an ASSU president.
I would like to thank Mr.
Quarles for pointing out that the
Bookstore is now competing with
A-Phi-O. Subscriptions on the
Bookstore’s blanks do not sup
port local service projects and do

not contribute to a Stanford schol
arship.
Anyone interested in subscrib
ing to any of Mr. Luce’s publica
tions at student rates is urged to
contact Alpha Phi Omega at Box
3058. The “rake-off” will be used
for the benefit of the Stanford
community.

In his letter yesterday, Mr. Da
vid Quarles objected to A-Phi-O’s
“peddling Time magazine at the
entrance of Mem And’’ during
registration. He is apparently un
aware of three important factors:
1. The “omnipresent subscrip
tion blank,” the notices from the
University, Public Exercises, Con
cert Series, etc. were all placed
in his social calendar and handed
to him by members of A-Phi-O.
(If he is interested in this pro
cedure, Mr. Quarles is invited to
help the A-Phi-O men “stuff” 10,-
000 sochtl calendars next quarter.)
In passing out the various reg
materials, A-Phi-O saves the Uni
versity money formerly spent on
paid help.
2. A-Phi-O is a service organiza
tion, Its many projects, from spon
soring a Scout troop in the Con
Home to building and painting
Daily boxes, all require money.
In earning this money, the
members of A-Phi-O perform
another service to the Stanford
student by making Time, Life, and
Sports Illustrated magazines
available at a substantial student
discount.

3. Each year A-Phi-O gives a
hall tuition scholarship financed
entirely by the sale of the afore
mentioned magazines. This schol
arship does not go to an A-Phi-O
member as was recently reported
in The Daily.
It is given to a junior or senior

who has shown leadership in stu
dent affairs chosen by the Uni
versity. One of the recent winners
was an ASSU president.
