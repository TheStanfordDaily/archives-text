500 miles in a jet transport yester
day to spend 15 minutes with
cancer-stricken House Speaker
Sam Rayburn. Kennedy praised
the 79-year-old Rayburn’s courage
in the face of certain death.
“We had a good conversation,’’
Kennedy said. “I was happy to
have a good chance to talk with
him.

“He's sick, of course, but I was
glad I could be with him. He
showed enough courage for any
body.”
