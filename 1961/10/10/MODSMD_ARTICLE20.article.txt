# RED HURLERS SET RECORD ...
## Yanks Win 13-5, Take Series; First Victory for Rookie Houk 
### OSCAR FRALEY 
CINCINNATI (UPI) New
York Yankee power pulverized the
hapless Cincinnati Reds, 13-5, yes
terday to win the World Series
and give the Bronx Bombers their
26th triumph in 26 classic appear
ances.
Johnny Blanchard and Hector
Lopez subbing for ailing stars
Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra
clubbed home runs to spearhead
a shattering la-hit Yankee attack
which included four doubles and
a triple against a record total of

eight Red pitchers.
SOUTHPAW Bud Daley, who
came on to put out a third inning
fire for Ralph Terry, was the win
ning pitcher. But it definitely
wasn’t a hurlers' day as the Yan
kees hung the defeat on much-
Jarred Joey Jay, knocked out in a
five-run frame.

Frank Robinson and Wally Post
ripped off homers for the Rods in
their aborted 11-hit rampage this
interminable afternoon before 32.-
589 sunbaked spectators. But
helping to nullify this barrage

were three Red errors and a wild
pitch.
The Yankees swept all three
played here in Crosley Field
marking the first time since the
Yankees beat the Dodgers in five
games in 1949 that a team failed
to win a game in its home park—
to take the series, four games to
one.
THE YANKEES broke this
game open in the first inning and
then proceeded to pound it info
splintered fragments.
Using up eight Reds pitchers,
the Yanks wiped out their own
memory of 1956, when they had
used seven in a game against the
Dodgers.
And there was individual tri
umph for little Bobby Richardson,
the pesky second baseman, who
singled to lead off the first inning.
THAT WAS his ninth hit in a
five-game series, tying a record
held by four others and unmatch
ed in the last 24 years.
Richardson started it off with
that record-tying single to center,
his ninth hit to match the mark
for a five-game series set by Home
Run Baker and Eddie Collins of
the Athletics in 1910 and tied by
Baker in 1913. Henie Groh of the
Giants in 1922 and Joe Moore of
the Giants in 1937.
