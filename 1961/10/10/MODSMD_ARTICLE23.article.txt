# Witness For The Opposition

### EARL GUSTKEY Spartan Daily Sports Editor 
Editor’s Nn((>; This is the first in a series of exchange columns
written l»y the sports editor from the opposing school. The series
will be a regular weekly feature of The Daily.

The year 1960 was a prosperous one for San Jose State football
fortunes. Now the word “prosperous” in this ease refers to one
specific instance Ihe victory over Stanford.
On Oct. 15 of last year, about 3000 San Jose State students
traveled up to the big Stanford Stadium to see what had come to be

an annual defeat since J954. Joy
was unrestrained on Ihe west side
of Ihe arena when the Spartans
rolled up a shocking 21-0 half
time advantage and went on to
win. 34-20.
Stanford was quite weak last
season, losing every game. San
Jose’s record was 5-4. Stanford is
a vastly improved club this season
as was shown in their remarkable
34-0 blanking of Oregon State.
Through the Idaho game of
Sept. 30, it appears that the big
gest loss suffered from gradua
tion was that of quarterback Mike
Jones. Jones was a great long pass
man, capable of throwing the
home run ball at any lime. This
year's quarterback for the Spar
tans, Chon Gallegos, played his
best game against Idaho. He com
pleted 15 of 22 passes for 166-
yards, but has trouble connecting
with the long one.

In picking a winner, one must look at several reasons why San
Jose won last year.
• Stanford was not expecting a tough game from the Spartans.
• San Jose knew this.
• Johnny Johnson. “Touchdown” Johnny scored four of the Spar
tans five touchdowns (He’s still performing at fullback, incidentally).
Stanford will be trying desperately to seek sweet revenge. But
isn’t it highly possible that the Indians will be just a lit lie over-eager
and make a few key mistakes? We think so.
Prediction: San Jose State 21, Stanford 19.

Jones. Jones was a great long pass
man, capable of throwing the
home run ball at any lime. This
year's quarterback for the Spar
tans, Chon Gallegos, played his
best game against Idaho. He com
pleted 15 of 22 passes for 166-
yards, but has trouble connecting
with the long one.

In picking a winner, one must look at several reasons why San
Jose won last year.
• Stanford was not expecting a tough game from the Spartans.
• San Jose knew this.
• Johnny Johnson. “Touchdown” Johnny scored four of the Spar
tans five touchdowns (He’s still performing at fullback, incidentally).
Stanford will be trying desperately to seek sweet revenge. But
isn’t it highly possible that the Indians will be just a lit lie over-eager
and make a few key mistakes? We think so.
Prediction: San Jose State 21, Stanford 19.

The year 1960 was a prosperous one for San Jose State football
fortunes. Now the word “prosperous” in this ease refers to one
specific instance Ihe victory over Stanford.
On Oct. 15 of last year, about 3000 San Jose State students
traveled up to the big Stanford Stadium to see what had come to be

an annual defeat since J954. Joy
was unrestrained on Ihe west side
of Ihe arena when the Spartans
rolled up a shocking 21-0 half
time advantage and went on to
win. 34-20.
Stanford was quite weak last
season, losing every game. San
Jose’s record was 5-4. Stanford is
a vastly improved club this season
as was shown in their remarkable
34-0 blanking of Oregon State.
Through the Idaho game of
Sept. 30, it appears that the big
gest loss suffered from gradua
tion was that of quarterback Mike
Jones. Jones was a great long pass
man, capable of throwing the
home run ball at any lime. This
year's quarterback for the Spar
tans, Chon Gallegos, played his
best game against Idaho. He com
pleted 15 of 22 passes for 166-
yards, but has trouble connecting
with the long one.
