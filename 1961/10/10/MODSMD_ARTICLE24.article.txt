# 'Not in Our League,' Moans Curtice After MSU Drubbing
## 
### 
Stanford and Michigan State
came out of their weekend clash
with a healthy respect for each
other.
Stanford football coach “Cactus
Jack” Curtice announced at the
Northern California Football
Writers’ Conference yesterday,
“Michigan State coach Duffy
Daugherty told me he decided he
couldn’t run against our middle
as he had against previous teams
and ran off-tackle slants. That’s
when they killed us.”
Curtice praised the Spartans,
saying, “that Michigan State just
plays in a different league than
we do.”
The football writers named half
hack Alan Nelson of California
and end Oscar Donohue of San
Jose State as the Northern Cali
fornia back and lineman of the
week. Nelson romped for big yard
age against Missouri Saturday.
Donohue blocked a punt and
grabbed several important passes
in the San Jose State 14-0 victory
over Colorado State.
Stanford came back to the Farm
riddled with injuries to key men.
Halfback Larry Royse broke his
collar bone and is out for the sea
son. Hal Steuber, fullback and

linebacker, possibly has broken
his jaw, and if so it out for an in
definite time. Steve Pursell has
a charleyhorse but probably will
play against San Jose State. Quar
terback Steve Thurlow wrenched
a knee but has been declared fit by
Stanford trainer Connie Jarvis.
