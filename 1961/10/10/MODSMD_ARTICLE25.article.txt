# Championship Harriers Entire Squad Returns
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
The entire squad from Stanford’s West Coast Cross Country!
Championship team of last year is back on the Farm, and it would !
seem logical that just by sticking with experienced material, Coach
Payton Jordan could guide the harriers to an outstanding season. I
But tlu' fact is, as was shown in Friday’s intra-squad meet, that

the boys who were the best on the
coast last year are really going to
have to battle just for their places
on the team.
This happy situation was
brought about by the addition of a
flock of outstanding freshmen and
some top transfer students to an
already experienced and spirited
squad. The best of the newcomers
is sophomore Harry McCalla, a
transfer from Fullerton Junior
College, where he not only set a
national junior college mile record
last year but also won the state
junior college two-mile.
McCalla was first in the intra
squad meet with a time of 21:30.1
for the 4.2-mile path on the Stan
ford Golf Course. Not far back
were two other members of the
youth movement, freshmen Dave
Stineback and Paul Schlicke, with
respective times of 21:39.7 and
21:56.8. Anything under 22 min

utes is a good time for this early
stage.
Finishing fourth and fifth
among the Stanfordites were Bill
Pratt and John Northway, who
last year battled for the second
spot behind Rich Klier, who
wasn’t able to run Friday because
of a tendon irritation. Robin Ru
ble, another starter in 1960, is
temporarily slowed down by an
attack of bronchitis.

Rounding out the top ton were
two more frosh, Weym Kirkland
and Harlan Andrews, Larry Sha
fer, a returning letferman, Jeff
Johnson, a junior transfer from
Colorado, and Dave Stone, a soph
omore.

So far, McCalla and Northway
have shown the most promise, fol
lowed by Pratt, who last year was
the fastest frosh distance runner
in Stanford history. But Stine
beck, Schlicke, Kirkland, and An
drews all are capable of bumping
the older runners off the team.
The first test for the Card har
riers will come this Saturday,
when they travel to Sacramento
for the Sacramento State Invita
tional. The following week they
take on Cal and USC at Berkeley
before returning home October
28th against UCLA and the hated
Golden Bears.

The climax of the season will
come Big Game Week, with the
Big Meeting being held Monday
afternoon, and the West Coast
Championships Saturday morn
ing, both at the Farm. By then ex
perience and youth should be so
blended that the harriers will be
able to provide a glorious finish
for what should he their best-ever
year.

national junior college mile record
last year but also won the state
junior college two-mile.
McCalla was first in the intra
squad meet with a time of 21:30.1
for the 4.2-mile path on the Stan
ford Golf Course. Not far back
were two other members of the
youth movement, freshmen Dave
Stineback and Paul Schlicke, with
respective times of 21:39.7 and
21:56.8. Anything under 22 min

utes is a good time for this early
stage.
Finishing fourth and fifth
among the Stanfordites were Bill
Pratt and John Northway, who
last year battled for the second
spot behind Rich Klier, who
wasn’t able to run Friday because
of a tendon irritation. Robin Ru
ble, another starter in 1960, is
temporarily slowed down by an
attack of bronchitis.

Rounding out the top ton were
two more frosh, Weym Kirkland
and Harlan Andrews, Larry Sha
fer, a returning letferman, Jeff
Johnson, a junior transfer from
Colorado, and Dave Stone, a soph
omore.

So far, McCalla and Northway
have shown the most promise, fol
lowed by Pratt, who last year was
the fastest frosh distance runner
in Stanford history. But Stine
beck, Schlicke, Kirkland, and An
drews all are capable of bumping
the older runners off the team.
The first test for the Card har
riers will come this Saturday,
when they travel to Sacramento
for the Sacramento State Invita
tional. The following week they
take on Cal and USC at Berkeley
before returning home October
28th against UCLA and the hated
Golden Bears.

The climax of the season will
come Big Game Week, with the
Big Meeting being held Monday
afternoon, and the West Coast
Championships Saturday morn
ing, both at the Farm. By then ex
perience and youth should be so
blended that the harriers will be
able to provide a glorious finish
for what should he their best-ever
year.

The entire squad from Stanford’s West Coast Cross Country!
Championship team of last year is back on the Farm, and it would !
seem logical that just by sticking with experienced material, Coach
Payton Jordan could guide the harriers to an outstanding season. I
But tlu' fact is, as was shown in Friday’s intra-squad meet, that

the boys who were the best on the
coast last year are really going to
have to battle just for their places
on the team.
This happy situation was
brought about by the addition of a
flock of outstanding freshmen and
some top transfer students to an
already experienced and spirited
squad. The best of the newcomers
is sophomore Harry McCalla, a
transfer from Fullerton Junior
College, where he not only set a
national junior college mile record
last year but also won the state
junior college two-mile.
