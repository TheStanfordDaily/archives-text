# Troubles With Math? A Computer Can Assist
## 
### DAN SCHWARTZ 
Got a problem? Be you soci
ologist or physicist, graduate or
undergraduate, faculty or staff,
the Computation Center has the
facilities to help you.
Established in March of 1953,
the Comp Center has its offices
and equipment in the basement,
first and second floors of the east
wing of Encina. Their computers
have been used in research con
ducted by the Radio Sciences Lab
oratory, and the statisticians from
the Center for Advanced Studies
in the Behavioral Sciences make
use of them in their studies.
The computers have been used
in processing data for Project
“M”, involved with the still-to-be
completed linear accelerator. Re
cently the PACE program has
used them to catalogue and or
ganize files of alumni and donors.
THE MAIN equipment, all in
the large, clean rooms in the east
ern basement of Encina include a
“Burrough’s 220” and a smaller
computer, an “IBM 650”. The big,
$350,000 “Burrough’s 220” is an
automatic, magnetic core, Data
Processing System with a 10,000
word memory and 5 large mag
netic tapes. Working at high
speed, the computer can do a sim
ple addition or subtraction in 200
micro-seconds, or 5000 such oper
ations in a single second. It is a
little slower with more compli
cated multiplication and division
operations, and can do only about
300 of them in one second.
The problems and “programs”
can be fed directly into the com
puter by use of a special language
called “Balgol,” and a Compiler
which translates the Balgol into
“machine language.” This makes
it unnecessary to break all prob
lems into simple additions and
multiplications as in more conven
tional computers. In the Balgol

language, a solution to the famili
ar quadratic equation would come
out as Root = ( -B TSQRT (B *
2-4.0 A.C.) ) / 2.0 A.
Dr. John G. Herriot, the associ
ate director of the Comp Center
and professor of mathematics, said
that any student with a “legiti
mate need” could make use of the
computers. He said that they come
under heavy use from many stu
dents in Math and Engineering,
and a number of undergraduates
and graduates are working in
“Computer Development” to im
prove the systems and learn more
about the workings and possibili
ties of the machines.
HERRIOT SAID that there is a
no credit, week long course, for
two hours a day, on the operation
of the computers, and the use of
the Balgol language. He said that,
in fact, a week before school began
for the fall quarter, 50 members
of the engineering faculty, includ
ing Dean Pettit, took the special
course.

It appears that the 25 regular
members of the Comp Center
staff have decided that computers,
with all their speed and precision
can not quite replace man entire
ly. Even though the Balgol lan
guage has made it easier than
before, men are still needed to
find the problems, to feed them in
to the machines, and to analyze
the results.

And on the wall right next to
the huge “Burrough’s 220” is a
small glass box. In that box is a
small, Chinese abacus and the
words: “For emergency use only
in case of computer failure.”
