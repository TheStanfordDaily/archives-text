Course Change
Policy Announced
Beginning this quarter a
new policy governing the
time limit for course changes
will be enforced. The new
policy states: “No course
may be added after the first
four weeks of the quarter;
no course may be dropped
after the first five weeks of
the quarter. These same
deadlines apply to the adding
or dropping of units in the
variable unit courses.”
This quarter no course
may be added after Oct. 24,
and the deadline for dropping
courses is Oct. 31.
Until now students have
been permitted to drop
courses up until four weeks
before the end of the quar
ter. According to Registrar
Harvey Hall, the rationale
behind the change is to force
students to choose definite
courses earlier in the quarter
so that they may approach
studying with a more intelli
gent attitude.
