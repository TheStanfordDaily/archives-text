## Unified Italy No Longer Capital of Unified West 
### MIRIAM BETENSKY 
In achieving nationhood 100 years ago, Italy both gained unifi
cation and lost its role as capital of the west. With unification
came problems of the cultural and developmental disparity be
tween the North and the South of Italy, explained Ranieri Di Sor
bello, editor of the Italian Foreign Office, at the Tuesday Evening

Series yesterday.
Di Sorbello is editor of his gov
ernment’s monthly information
bulletin "Italian Scene.”
Italy united relatively late due
in part to a feeling that she was
different from the rest of the
world—the ancient capital of the
West. This feeling of a distinct
culture lingered in Italy as late
as the 18th century and disunity
was augmented by the jealousy
between citv-states.

Dante’s idea of unity in his De
Monarchia included the unity of
more than simply Italy it meant
the unity of the Western world.
After Napoleon the destiny of the
West turned not to unification but
nationhood.
Today the feeling that the world
and the West should unite has re
turned and the goal of Dante is
perhaps near.
AFTKR NAPOLEON, Italy’s
problem was to convert the spirit
ual fact of its existence into physi
cal fact. The makers of the new
Italy were Northerners, as Gari
baldi. Ignorance of the South was
a large problem; Garibaldi had
never seen the South of Italy until
the liberation in 1860.

The making of Italy, however,
was one of the greatest achieve
ments of the liberal school in the
last century, a showpiece of liber
al thought, the editor emphasized.
While the North had advanced
into the industrial growth, the
South was kept down by the Bour
bon government at Naples, ex
plained Di Sorbello.

“CARPETBAGGING,” a grow
ing population and lack of indus
trial equipment hindered the de
velopment of the South. “Exploit
ation” of the South by the North
has been a recurrent theme of
Italian historians for the last 100
years.

Cure of malaria by U.S. Army
introduced DDT after the war,
emigration, railways and indus
trialization have gone a long way
to raise the standards in the
South, but a difference still re
mains. This disparity is a source
of great discussion in Italy.
Socialistic practices have aided
the South’s growth Di Sorbello
explained. The Cassa del Mezzogi
orno, a public works authority for
loaning or spending money in the
South, lias been fairly successful
in building of the South.
The difference in temperament
between North and South or be
tween any parts of the world is
not to be entirely ameliorated,
the Italian feels. In our world
move toward unification and
peace we should not destroy our
diversification. “We must remem
ber where we came from.”
