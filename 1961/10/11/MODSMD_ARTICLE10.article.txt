## Tribunal's Smith Act Decision Sets 'Dangerous Precedent' 
### RON RAPOPORT Associate Editor 
i The sad part of the Supreme
Court’s recent refusal to drop the
that the United
States Communist Party register
as an agent of the Soviet Union is
not that the Party will now shrivel
up and die. For all practical pur
poses that happened a long time
ago.
The most unfortunate aspect of
the decision is the most dangerous
precedent that has been set.
If the American Communist
Party ever was an effective voice
of protest in this country, that
day has long passed.
THE TROUBLES that have be
seigod it from within and without
have been more than enough to
make the Party a sorry excuse
for what the Supreme Court calls,
“a conspiracy agent.”
Thus, the Court’s decision and
the Attorney General’s announced
iplans to prosecute if it is not
jObeyed, will mean little to the
Party. The Justice Department
will be wasting a lot of money
swatting dead flies.
And probably little discomfort
will be added to the lives of the
individual American Communists.
The names of each of them is
without question already on more
lists than Babe Ruth’s. Neither the
Attorney General, the FBI, the
HUAC nor anybody else can be
expected to learn the name of any
more Communists.
SO THE specific problems of the
American Communist Party are
almost unimportant when com
pared with the significance of the
decision.
If one group is called an agent
of subversion by an act of Con
gress (the Court was actually up
holding registration provisions of
the Smith and McCarran acts)
what is to prevent another group
from also being so labeled?
For instance, it is obvious that
Senator Eastland of Mississippi
considers the NAACP subversive.
And Senator Smathers of Florida
seems to think the same thing of
the Fair Play for Cuba Commit
tee.
Could laws of Congress official
ly designating them as such mean
their demise?
CONCEIVABLY, it could work
the other way as well. Perhaps
some liberal Congressman could
see his way clear to calling the
John Birch Society subversive. It
is doubtful that Robert Welch,
JBS’s grand vizier, would be very
happy about being forced to re
veal the names of all his members.
The tendency seems dangerous,
not to mention unconstitutional.
It sems ironic that a group offi
cially labelled as subversive to the

interests of a country should he
fighting to uphold that country’s
system of civil liberties.
