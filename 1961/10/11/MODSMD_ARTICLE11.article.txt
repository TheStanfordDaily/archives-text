Editor, The Daily:
In defense of Ross Hermann’s
perceptive column of Oct. 5, I
would like to point out some of
the distortions made by David
Barnum in his letter of Oct. 9,
which was intended to discredit
Mr. Hermann’s column.

Briefly, the thesis of Mr. Her
mann’s column was that Com
munists are insincere in their
front organization efforts to pro
mote civil liberties and other so
cial causes. To back up this ten
able position, he cited the case of
Carl Braden, an identified Com
munist who was convicted for
sedition for willfully inciting ra
cial violence.

Mr. Barnum, in attacking Mr.
Hermann, states that Communist
literature was not found in the
Braden home but in the residence
of another so-called social cru
sader.

Quoting from the U.S. News and
World Report of Dec. 31, 1954,
“Police raided the Braden and
Ford homes, came back with
boxes filled with Communist liter
ature.” Perhaps Mr. Barnum can
quote a more authoritative source
than the highly respected U.S.
News and World Report.
A serious implication that per
vades the Barnum letter is that
the Louisville and Kentucky state
officials deliberately overlooked
their responsibilities under law
and seized upon the Bradens as
scapegoats. This is a serious
charge.
Unless Mr. Barnum can do a
better job of documenting it, this
charge will have to be dismissed
as the frivolous statement of a
biased mind.

For example, Mr. Barnum ques
tions the opinion of the Louisville
grand jury, arrived at after ex
tensive investigation, that the
home bombing was an inside job.
Perhaps Mr. Barnum was closer to
the scene than the grand jury
members and can give us the real
inside scoop. Until he does, his
charge remains without sub
stance.

It is my conclusion after ex
amining the facts of the Braden
case that it is Mr. Barnum, rather
than Mr. Hermann, who is guilty
of distorting the facts to fit a pre
conceived purpose.

For example, Mr. Barnum ques
tions the opinion of the Louisville
grand jury, arrived at after ex
tensive investigation, that the
home bombing was an inside job.
Perhaps Mr. Barnum was closer to
the scene than the grand jury
members and can give us the real
inside scoop. Until he does, his
charge remains without sub
stance.

It is my conclusion after ex
amining the facts of the Braden
case that it is Mr. Barnum, rather
than Mr. Hermann, who is guilty
of distorting the facts to fit a pre
conceived purpose.

Editor, The Daily:
In defense of Ross Hermann’s
perceptive column of Oct. 5, I
would like to point out some of
the distortions made by David
Barnum in his letter of Oct. 9,
which was intended to discredit
Mr. Hermann’s column.

Briefly, the thesis of Mr. Her
mann’s column was that Com
munists are insincere in their
front organization efforts to pro
mote civil liberties and other so
cial causes. To back up this ten
able position, he cited the case of
Carl Braden, an identified Com
munist who was convicted for
sedition for willfully inciting ra
cial violence.

Mr. Barnum, in attacking Mr.
Hermann, states that Communist
literature was not found in the
Braden home but in the residence
of another so-called social cru
sader.

Quoting from the U.S. News and
World Report of Dec. 31, 1954,
“Police raided the Braden and
Ford homes, came back with
boxes filled with Communist liter
ature.” Perhaps Mr. Barnum can
quote a more authoritative source
than the highly respected U.S.
News and World Report.
A serious implication that per
vades the Barnum letter is that
the Louisville and Kentucky state
officials deliberately overlooked
their responsibilities under law
and seized upon the Bradens as
scapegoats. This is a serious
charge.
Unless Mr. Barnum can do a
better job of documenting it, this
charge will have to be dismissed
as the frivolous statement of a
biased mind.

tions the opinion of the Louisville
grand jury, arrived at after ex
tensive investigation, that the
home bombing was an inside job.
