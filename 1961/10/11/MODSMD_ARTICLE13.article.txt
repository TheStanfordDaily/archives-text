# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						Taiwan View of Red China 
### GODWIN CHU 
When a second article appeared
in The Daily, this time by a po
litical analyst of the HR, advo
cating the admission of Commu
nist China to the United Nations,
I think a few remarks by a stu
dent from Taiwan might not be
completely out of order.
I intend to look at the problem
from four different angles; the
interests of Nationalist China, of
the United States, of Communist
China and of the frqe world as a
whole.
Presumably the line of thinking
of those who advocate Peiping’s
entry to the U.N. would necessi
tate American diplomatic recog
nition of Communist China. So
let’s view these two problems as
one.
FIRST, UNDER the present sit
uation, acceptance of Peiping’s
credentials, instead of Taipei’s,
would mean the loss of its seat by
Nationalist China. And since the
whole deal would involve Ameri
can recognition of Peiping, this
has to mean the withdrawal of
your recognition of Nationalist
China, which still claims sover
eignty over the whole China.
This will be a deadly blow to the
Nationalist Chinese, and some
body might say it would be an act
of betrayal of a war-time ally, to
whom the U.S. is still bound by a
mutual defense treaty. I am not
saying that the behavior of a na
tion should be guided by treaties
only. Treaties were often written
to be broken, as modern history
has taught us. But to say that the
U.S. leader of the free world, is
capable of doing this, is a little be
yond my imagination.
However, this should not worry
you too much.
SECOND, LET’S consider the
interests of the U.S. For one thing,
American traders can hope to do
more business with Peiping. For
another, your diplomats, and per
haps correspondents too, can go
to Red China. You might hope to
get about the same kind of treat
ment as the British now receive.
Of course, you have to admit the
Chinese Communist “diplomats,”
who we all know are nothing but
spies.
Some of your allied countries
will feel happy now that one main
difference between your govern
ment and theirs is removed. You
can expect to hear eulogy from
those capitals.
But on the other hand, a string
of nations in Southeast Asia,
whose resistahce against infiltra
tion and aggression by Commun
ist China is now kept up by
American pledge of assistance,
would probably change their
mind, and policy too.
WHAT’S THE POINT of antag
onizing a big, burly gangster next
door now that the “policeman”
has come to terms with him?
Let’s buy peace from him, and do
it quickly.
So you can safely expect a good
many of those countries to declare
their neutrality and sign “good
will” treaties with Peiping.
The treaties they have signed
with the U.S. under the Southeast
Asian Treaty Organization
(SEATO) will become trash. And
SEATO will collapse overnight.
The line of U.S. defense will be
back to Pearl Harbor days.
Now let’s see what will happen
to Communist China. Actually
this angle has been partly covered
in the preceding paragraphs. In
external affairs, you can expect
to see a new master of Asia, in the

person of Mao Tse-tung. Uncle
Sam will do well by staying a safe
distance away, just as he is stay
ing away from Eastern Europe
now.

IN INTERNAL affairs, the
hands of the Chinese Communist
regime will be so much strength
ened. Let there be famines, dis
asters and unrest. Peiping will
have nothing to be afraid of, be
cause the U.S. recognition would
have killed, once for all, the hope
of the Chinese people to regain
their liberty.
Finally, the interests of the free
world as a whole. If we speak of
the interests in terms of what the
United Nations can do, then we
would see more vetoes, more
name calling, and more trouble

making. When a proposal comes
up to a vote, you have to deal with
not only the Soviet bloc, but also
a new bloc of satellites terrorized
by Communist China. In short,
the U.N. would be virtually dead.
CAN you expect Mao Tse-tung
& Co. to behave nicely once it is
a member of family of nations?
I’ll leave the answer to you. But
before you draw a conclusion, I
would just remind you of Korea,
of Tibet, of the shootings along
the Indian border, of the kind of
treatment American prisoners-of
war got, of the skeleton-like mis
sionary people, Catholic and Pro
testants, who could hardly stand
up when the Chinese Communists
threw them out.
Then you can decide.

(SEATO) will become trash. And
SEATO will collapse overnight.
The line of U.S. defense will be
back to Pearl Harbor days.
Now let’s see what will happen
to Communist China. Actually
this angle has been partly covered
in the preceding paragraphs. In
external affairs, you can expect
to see a new master of Asia, in the

person of Mao Tse-tung. Uncle
Sam will do well by staying a safe
distance away, just as he is stay
ing away from Eastern Europe
now.

IN INTERNAL affairs, the
hands of the Chinese Communist
regime will be so much strength
ened. Let there be famines, dis
asters and unrest. Peiping will
have nothing to be afraid of, be
cause the U.S. recognition would
have killed, once for all, the hope
of the Chinese people to regain
their liberty.
Finally, the interests of the free
world as a whole. If we speak of
the interests in terms of what the
United Nations can do, then we
would see more vetoes, more
name calling, and more trouble

making. When a proposal comes
up to a vote, you have to deal with
not only the Soviet bloc, but also
a new bloc of satellites terrorized
by Communist China. In short,
the U.N. would be virtually dead.
CAN you expect Mao Tse-tung
& Co. to behave nicely once it is
a member of family of nations?
I’ll leave the answer to you. But
before you draw a conclusion, I
would just remind you of Korea,
of Tibet, of the shootings along
the Indian border, of the kind of
treatment American prisoners-of
war got, of the skeleton-like mis
sionary people, Catholic and Pro
testants, who could hardly stand
up when the Chinese Communists
threw them out.
Then you can decide.
When a second article appeared
in The Daily, this time by a po
litical analyst of the HR, advo
cating the admission of Commu
nist China to the United Nations,
I think a few remarks by a stu
dent from Taiwan might not be
completely out of order.
I intend to look at the problem
from four different angles; the
interests of Nationalist China, of
the United States, of Communist
China and of the frqe world as a
whole.
Presumably the line of thinking
of those who advocate Peiping’s
entry to the U.N. would necessi
tate American diplomatic recog
nition of Communist China. So
let’s view these two problems as
one.
FIRST, UNDER the present sit
uation, acceptance of Peiping’s
credentials, instead of Taipei’s,
would mean the loss of its seat by
Nationalist China. And since the
whole deal would involve Ameri
can recognition of Peiping, this
has to mean the withdrawal of
your recognition of Nationalist
China, which still claims sover
eignty over the whole China.
This will be a deadly blow to the
Nationalist Chinese, and some
body might say it would be an act
of betrayal of a war-time ally, to
whom the U.S. is still bound by a
mutual defense treaty. I am not
saying that the behavior of a na
tion should be guided by treaties
only. Treaties were often written
to be broken, as modern history
has taught us. But to say that the
U.S. leader of the free world, is
capable of doing this, is a little be
yond my imagination.
However, this should not worry
you too much.
SECOND, LET’S consider the
interests of the U.S. For one thing,
American traders can hope to do
more business with Peiping. For
another, your diplomats, and per
haps correspondents too, can go
to Red China. You might hope to
get about the same kind of treat
ment as the British now receive.
Of course, you have to admit the
Chinese Communist “diplomats,”
who we all know are nothing but
spies.
Some of your allied countries
will feel happy now that one main
difference between your govern
ment and theirs is removed. You
can expect to hear eulogy from
those capitals.
But on the other hand, a string
of nations in Southeast Asia,
whose resistahce against infiltra
tion and aggression by Commun
ist China is now kept up by
American pledge of assistance,
would probably change their
mind, and policy too.
WHAT’S THE POINT of antag
onizing a big, burly gangster next
door now that the “policeman”
has come to terms with him?
Let’s buy peace from him, and do
it quickly.
So you can safely expect a good
many of those countries to declare
their neutrality and sign “good
will” treaties with Peiping.
The treaties they have signed
with the U.S. under the Southeast
Asian Treaty Organization
(SEATO) will become trash. And
SEATO will collapse overnight.

of betrayal of a war-time ally, to
whom the U.S. is still bound by a
mutual defense treaty. I am not
saying that the behavior of a na
tion should be guided by treaties
only. Treaties were often written
to be broken, as modern history
has taught us. But to say that the
U.S. leader of the free world, is
capable of doing this, is a little be
yond my imagination.
However, this should not worry
you too much.
SECOND, LET’S consider the
interests of the U.S. For one thing,
American traders can hope to do
more business with Peiping. For
another, your diplomats, and per
haps correspondents too, can go
to Red China. You might hope to
get about the same kind of treat
ment as the British now receive.
Of course, you have to admit the
Chinese Communist “diplomats,”
who we all know are nothing but
spies.
Some of your allied countries
will feel happy now that one main
difference between your govern
ment and theirs is removed. You
can expect to hear eulogy from
those capitals.
But on the other hand, a string
of nations in Southeast Asia,
whose resistahce against infiltra
tion and aggression by Commun
ist China is now kept up by
American pledge of assistance,
would probably change their
mind, and policy too.
WHAT’S THE POINT of antag
onizing a big, burly gangster next
door now that the “policeman”
has come to terms with him?
Let’s buy peace from him, and do
it quickly.
So you can safely expect a good
many of those countries to declare
their neutrality and sign “good
will” treaties with Peiping.
The treaties they have signed
with the U.S. under the Southeast
Asian Treaty Organization
(SEATO) will become trash. And
SEATO will collapse overnight.
The line of U.S. defense will be
back to Pearl Harbor days.
Now let’s see what will happen
to Communist China. Actually
this angle has been partly covered
in the preceding paragraphs. In
external affairs, you can expect
to see a new master of Asia, in the

person of Mao Tse-tung. Uncle
Sam will do well by staying a safe
distance away, just as he is stay
ing away from Eastern Europe
now.

IN INTERNAL affairs, the
hands of the Chinese Communist
regime will be so much strength
ened. Let there be famines, dis
asters and unrest. Peiping will
have nothing to be afraid of, be
cause the U.S. recognition would
have killed, once for all, the hope
of the Chinese people to regain
their liberty.
Finally, the interests of the free
world as a whole. If we speak of
the interests in terms of what the
United Nations can do, then we
would see more vetoes, more
name calling, and more trouble

making. When a proposal comes
up to a vote, you have to deal with
not only the Soviet bloc, but also
a new bloc of satellites terrorized
by Communist China. In short,
the U.N. would be virtually dead.
CAN you expect Mao Tse-tung
& Co. to behave nicely once it is
a member of family of nations?
I’ll leave the answer to you. But
before you draw a conclusion, I
would just remind you of Korea,
of Tibet, of the shootings along
the Indian border, of the kind of
treatment American prisoners-of
war got, of the skeleton-like mis
sionary people, Catholic and Pro
testants, who could hardly stand
up when the Chinese Communists
threw them out.
Then you can decide.
When a second article appeared
in The Daily, this time by a po
litical analyst of the HR, advo
cating the admission of Commu
nist China to the United Nations,
I think a few remarks by a stu
dent from Taiwan might not be
completely out of order.
I intend to look at the problem
from four different angles; the
interests of Nationalist China, of
the United States, of Communist
China and of the frqe world as a
whole.
Presumably the line of thinking
of those who advocate Peiping’s
entry to the U.N. would necessi
tate American diplomatic recog
nition of Communist China. So
let’s view these two problems as
one.
FIRST, UNDER the present sit
uation, acceptance of Peiping’s
credentials, instead of Taipei’s,
would mean the loss of its seat by
Nationalist China. And since the
whole deal would involve Ameri
can recognition of Peiping, this
has to mean the withdrawal of
your recognition of Nationalist
China, which still claims sover
eignty over the whole China.
This will be a deadly blow to the
Nationalist Chinese, and some
body might say it would be an act
of betrayal of a war-time ally, to
whom the U.S. is still bound by a
mutual defense treaty. I am not
saying that the behavior of a na
