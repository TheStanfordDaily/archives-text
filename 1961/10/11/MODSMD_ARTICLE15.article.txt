# Walter Lippmann On the Berlin Talks
## 
### 
As I make it out from what I
have heard, the situation at this
point in the talks about Berlin is
that while the important issues
have been identified, they are not
as yet clearly defined. No settle
ment is as yet in sight. Indeed, on
the hard core of the problem there
has as yet been no negotiations
and almost certainly no thorough
exploration. In fact, neither side
has as yet disclosed in the con
crete what it will regard as an ac
ceptable settlement.

There has, however, been prog
ress in reducing certain highly in
flammable secondary issues. So
far as I know this has not been
done by formal agreement but
tacitly. The Soviet government is
byway of accepting the indisput
able fact that the United States
and its allies will not sign a peace
treaty with East Germany, but
they will not open up diplomatic
intercourse with it and treat it as
a lawful government. Their rela
tions with East Germany can be
no more than de facto.

THE counterpart on our side is
the tacit admission that there are
two German States, and that it is
no longer a practical objective of
American policy to unify them by
the integration of East Germany
into West Germany.
As a corollary of the Soviet re
cession on the demand that we
must sign a peace treaty, there is
evidence of an understanding
which is of great importance al
though there is not yet a formal
agreement. The understanding is
that Moscow, having negotiated
with us a bill of rights for West
Berlin, will incorporate this bill of
rights in its own treaty which it
intends to sign with East Ger
many.

This is a concession from the
position often taken by Soviet of
ficials in the past that we would
have to negotiate about our rights
in West Berlin not with them but
with the Ulbricht government.
OX OUR side, the counterpart
of the Communist concession is
that we will not refuse to let East
German officials replace Soviet
officials on the access route. In
this connection we must remem
ber that for some years East Ger
many has been administering con
trol of West German and civilian
access except in the air corridors.
The East Gormans have adminis
tered control over about 95 per
cent of the traffic to West Berlin.
All of this does not, however,
bring us to the hard core of the
issues. The Soviet government
has notified us that it will guar
antee access of West Berlin on
condition that West Berlin be
comes a demilitarized free city, as
they define these words. This is
the hard core of the controversy,
and it is important that we should
know as exactly as possible what
the issues are.

The Soviet government wants to
sever the connection between
West Berlin and NATO. No doubt
Moscow would prefer to have no
separate city of West Berlin. But
its immediate objective is not to
absorb West Berlin into East Ger
many, which would mean war, but
to isolate West Berlin. It would
be isolated politically altogether
and in some negotiable degree it
would be isolated economically.
THE SOVIET government
wants also to cut the connection
with NATO. It is willing to agree
to a continuation of Western
troops in West Berlin but—and
this is a very big but—there must
then also be some Soviet troops.
The ultimate objective of this may
be to be able to paralyze the allied
troops and the West Berlin gov
ernment in case of a Communist
coup. But the immediate objective
is to divorce the internal defense
of Berlin from the competence of
NATO.
As against these Soviet de
mands for a radical change in the
status of West Berlin, our policy
has been to maintain the status
quo, or as much of it as we can
maintain without making conces
sions that would be regarded as
surrender or appeasement.
We have never had and we do
not now have a positive American
and Western proposal for giving
West Berlin a more durable and a
more secure status than it now
has. The policy of standing pat
firmly means that Berlin is in a
condition of perpetual crisis,
which can never be resolved,
where the choices are always to go
to the brink of war or to incur the
odium of appeasement.
THE GAP IS wide between the
Soviet demand for a radical
change and the Western adher
ence to the status quo. President
Kennedy is in a very difficult po
sition and he deserves and needs
the understanding and support of
his own people. He is being
squeezed by his adversary in Mos
cow. by his allies in Bonn and
Paris, and by the right wing here
at home.
The net result of these multiple
conflicting pressures could he to
immobilize Mm on the brink of
thermonuclear war. The Presi
dent’s responsibilities are grave.
But also grave are the respon
sibilities of those Germans,
Frenchmen and Americans who

are tying his hands and are doing
what they can to prevent negoti
ations and to precipitate a show
down.

To want to avert a show-down
is not to lack nerve. It is to pos
sess a realization of what thermo
nuclear war would really mean
and what are the imperatives of
diplomacy in this nuclear age.
The President of the United States
must not be driven into a corner
where the only alternatives open
to him are dishonor or surrender.

AS I READ the situation today,
a failure to negotiate a settlement
will mean, at the least, that West
Berlin will have no emotional se
curity whatever. It will never
know what the East Germans will
do to harass or to close down the
access routes. Thus the Commun
ists might do nothing for an in
definite time and that would be
quite enough to keep Berlin and
the world sitting on the anxious
seat.

This is the way to create a
panic in West Berlin and an in
tolerable frustration elsewhere.

At the worst, if there is no posi
tive settlement, the Communists
will narrow' down, even if they do
not close down, access to West
Berlin, and this will bring us all
to the brink of a thermonuclear
war.

I do not think anyone can now
foresee how Europe and America
and the rest of the world would
act if it were in fact on the brink
of thermonuclear war. It has
never been on the brink of ther
monuclear war. The world does
not now believe that there will be
a thermonuclear war and that is
why so many who ought to know
better talk about it so glibly.

THE PRESIDENT will have to
lift the dispute above the issue of
whether West Berlin is to be what
the Soviets call a free city or
whether it is to remain as it is
with nothing changed. The most
promising way he can do this is to
propose that West Berlin be trans
formed into an international city,
the site of organs of the United
Nations and an international cen
ter for study, scientific research,
art and sports.
This would be a good future, far
better than to be a dying city kept
alive by subsidies and by the du
bious assumption that the United
Slates and its allies will always
be willing to live on the brink of
thermonuclear war.
My own exploration leads me to
think that the international solu
tion, utopian and idealistic though
it sounds, might bo made to work
and could be acceptable.
