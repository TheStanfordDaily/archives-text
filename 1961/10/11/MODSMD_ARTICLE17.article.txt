## Birch Society 'Awake' To Communist Danger 
### BOSS HERMANN 
What is the John Birch Society?
This is a question that responsi
ble Americans of all political per
suasions have been asking. Unfor
tunately, the press hasn’t been
very helpful in providing an an
swer.
Instead of giving the people ob
jective information, the mass me
dia has been the vanguard for
slanderous attacks on the organi
zation.
THE IMAGE of the John Birch
Society that the press has con
jured up is (hat of a semi-secret,
neo-fascist organization, whose
members, chiefly retired military
men and “little old ladies in ten
nis shoes,” spy on their neighbors,
libel public officials, and even oc
casionally accuse each other of
Communist leanings.
Specifically, the liberal objec
tions to the John Birch Society are
as follows:
OBJECTION I: The Birch Soci
ety is a semi-secret organization.
This belief stems from the fact
that the society’s founder Robert
Welch refuses to make public
either financial statements or
membership lists. The society con
siders this policy necessary to
avoid Communist infiltration.
Are these provisions sufficient
to brand the organization as semi
secret? I think not. Members are
free to acknowledge their affilia
tion, invite guests to meetings,
and speak openly on the activities
of the society, as they frequently
do.
OBJECTION 2; The Birch Soci
ety is the beginning of a fascist
revival. This charge, arising from
the mistaken belief that Welch
rules the organization with an
iron hand and dictates conformity
among its members, is completely

without justification either in the
structure of the society or in its
stated principles.
The Birch Society is directed by
an executive council, the members
of which often make public state
ments that conflict with Welch.
Dean Manion, a member of the
council, was questioned on this
subject recently and staled that
“no one, including Bob Welch,
tells me what to say.”
Moreover, a look at the prin
ciples of the society will show
that it is inimically opposed to all
kinds of socialism, including Na
tional Socialism. The image of fas
cism has also been built upon the
fact that there are many active
and retired members of the mili
tary in the society. Perhaps it is
a failing of the liberal mind to
stereotype military men as fas
cists.

OBJECTION 3: The society vi
olates the right of privacy by tap
ping telephones and using other
spy methods to uncover Commun
ism. One Birch chapter in Kansas
is reported to have done this,
while the society consists of sever
al hundred chapters, each of
which determines the nature of its
own activities. Most chapters have
set themselves up merely as study
groups intended for the political
education of its members.
OBJECTION 4: The Birch Soci
ety has made slanderous state
ments about leading Americans,
including former President Eisen
hower. Robert Welch, not the
Birch Society, has made such
statements, and his controversial
book, “The Politician,” in which
these accusations are made, is not
an official document of the soci
ety. In fact, this book was written
several years before the society
was formed and has been repudi
ated by many of the society’s
prominent members, including
Congressman John Rousselot of
Southern California.

I have attempted to show what
the Birch Society is not. The ques
tion remains: What is it?
Briefly, it is an anti-Commun
ist organization founded on the as
sumption that Communist infil
tration and subversion in this
country has reached a dangerous
level. This contention is well sup
ported by the findings of the
House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities and by FBI chief J.
Edgar Hoover’s book, “Masters of
Deceit.”

THE BIKC H SOCIETY supple
merits its anti-Communist position
with a strong conservative phi
losophy, which includes emphasis
on limited government, states
rights, opposition to welfare state
spending and a revival of spiritual
values. It sees in this position the
only firm base from which to ef
fectively attack Communism.

John Rousselot, a member of
the Birch Society who campaigned
for and won a congressional seat
as a conservative, began his
speeches with the following quo
tation from Nikita Khrushchev,
which is taken by the Birch Soci
ety as a challenge.
"We cannot expect Americans
to jump from Capitalism to Com
munism, but we can assist their
elected leaders in giving Ameri
cans small doses of Socialism,
until they suddenly awake to find
they have Communism.”
The John Birch Society is al
ready awake.
