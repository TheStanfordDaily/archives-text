Editor, The Daily;
I am astounded by what is
either your incredible naivete or
your unabashed toeing of the
Communist line in the editorial
of Oct. 9.
On the one hand you say that
civil liberties would not “stand for
long if Communists gained power
in the United States,” while you
come back saying “that it is pos
sible for a Communist to honest
ly believe in civil liberties and
work for them.” I am astounded
because in seven years of reading
stupid Daily editorials, this is the
all-time low.

Perhaps you feel that since you
believe that in this country Com
munism is becoming weak, you
must do all that you can to sup
port it. Instead you would do well
to focus at least part of your en
ergies in encouraging someone
with more traditional American
ideals to state his views on civil
liberties. Or you could actively
promote viewing of the outstand
ing television program, “A Way
of Thinking” on Sunday nights.

This editorial is but another
blatant sign of the pseudocogita
five Stanford undergraduate's in
fantile intellectualization about
problems of which he has little
understanding and his hopeless
confusion of “tolerance of others'
ideas” with the Communist line.
