# P.A. Council Okays Dam
## 
### 
Palo Alto’s City Council has
voiced its approval of the contro
versial Ladera Dam flood control
project, which Stanford opposes.
The project would take 525 acres
of Stanford land in the foothills.
In its Monday meeting, the
Council unanimously okayed a
resolution approving the project
and urging a start on construction
as soon as possible.
Stanford’s Board of Trustees
and the Menlo Park City Council
oppose the plan because they say
it would take up too much valu
able land.
The reservoir of the dam w'ould
be between Searsviile and Felt
lakes on the campus. It would
reach to Sand Hill Road.
Jerry Keithley, Palo Alto city
manager, said the City Council
could not, alone, obtain the dam.
“To get this dam, the public is
going to have to let Congress
know how badly we need it,” he
declared.
Stanford Business Manager Alf
Brandin has urged that an alter
nate proposal to the project be
considered.
