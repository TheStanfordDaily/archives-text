Editor, The Daily:
It is unfortunate when an insti
tution the size of Stanford Uni
versity is completely Rally Con
ned.
According to the Student Hand
book, “Rally Committee stages
all athletic rallies.” All rallies, i.e.,
except those conceived by other
organizations for the benefit of
the school as a whole.
This other kind of rally, because
it gives no recognition to those
brave few who wear the Rally
Com Red, is frowned upon by
those unrecognized martyrs to
school spirit.
The Freshman Class, without
formal organization, and certainly
without aid from the aforemen
tioned group, staged a successful
rally. If this can be done by an un
organized body, an established
group should be able to carry off
tremendous efforts. However,
ENGAGEMENT
Crothers Memorial Hall an
nounces the engagement of David
G. Luenberger, Grad. EE, to Nan
cy A. Iverson, Stanford, '6l.

from our first observation of j
these efforts, it would seem that |
Rally Com is in charge of the card
throwing section.
When the Freshmen asked Rally
Com to help stage a rally, Rally
Com agreed, if they could handle
the whole show. When it was
made clear that this was unsatis
factory, RC kindly consented to
make posters. The time to work
approached and the nearest
known member of Rally Com was
at Searsville Lake.

Three solutions present them
selves :
(At Rally Com live up to its
name.
(B) Change the name to either
Party Com or Spirits Raising
Com.
(C) Rally Com put school spirit
on the agenda for the next meet
ing at the lake.
Perhaps RC . . . had reasons for
denying aid. The Freshman Class
would like to hear them.
