# SJS Stronger Than Ever
## Spartan Gridders Figure to Be Improved Over Last Season 
### 
It was the highlight of the year for San Jose’s surprising Spar
tans when they upset Stanford, 34-20, last season to win the Penin
sula Championship for the first time since 1954.
The Spartans, jealously clinging to that distinction, will field a
team that appears to he stronger than the ’6O squad in every de-

partment but passing. 4
Here Coach Bob Titchenal had
to replace Mike Jones, one of the
finest passers on the Coast last
year. Jones threw for 1049 yards,
a total which ranked the Spar
tans eighth nationally in passing
offense.

Monday. The big senior loads all
Spartan receivers with 11 catches
for 1 (14 yards.
HALFBACK Mac Burton, com
bining speed and agility, presents
another headache for the Cardi
nal secondary. Burton, who led
the team in that department last
year, is second with 152 yards
spread over 10 receptions.
The Spartan backfield will have
good speed in fullback Johnny
Johnson and halfbacks Phil Clif
ton and Burton all better than
10-flat sprinters.
Johnson, a possible All-America
candidate, averaged 5.7 yards per
carry for the Sparts last year and
yards in 49 carries.

Senior Chon Gallegos has
stepped up to take over the sig
nal-calling duties after waiting
in the wings last year. Gallegos
surprised even the most optimis
tic San Jose fans as he led the
Spartans to a 14-13 upset of Brig
ham Young in their opening

game.
IN FOUR OUTINGS the senior
signal-caller has hit the target at
a .575 rate, and his 559 yai’ds is
far ahe a d of the pace set by
Jones. Gallegos has yet to show
that he can throw the long one
and so the passing game will not
be as big a threat as in ’6O.
For receivers the Spartans
have three outstanding ends in
Oscar Donahue, Ray Pena, and
David Chuid. Donahue was the
hero in San Jose’s win over Colo
rado State last weekend as he
caught a 21-yard touchdown pass
from Gallegos and set up another
by blocking a punt on the State
21.
He was named Northern Cali
fornia lineman of the week at
the football writers luncheon

is again up around 5.6 with 275

CLIFTON is the No. 2 man on
the ground, having picked up 194
yards in 41 carries. Clifton, a
senior, didn’t see much action last
year, but the lack of experience
hasn’t held him back.
Burton, at the other half, is
one of the best. A high school
All-American in both track and
football, Mac gave up broad
jumping to concentrate on the
gridiron. He has carried the ball
only four times this year for a
hefty 12.5 yard average.
Up front the Spartans are two
deep in every position with
highly experienced personnel.


SPARTAN HALFBACK JOHNNY JOHNSON
In last year's 34-20 San Jose triumph over Stanford, it was swift
Johnson who carried for four of SJS's five touchdowns. The Spar
tan speedster will be out to help extend the San Jose win streak
to two in a row over the Cards Saturday.


SAN JOSE SIGNAL-CALLER CHON GALLEGOS
Stepping into the shoes of graduated Mike Jones, Gallegos has done
a yeoman's job leading the Spartans to a 3-1 mark this season.
Gallegos will be starting at quarterback for San Jose State Satur
day against the Indians.

gridiron. He has carried the ball
only four times this year for a
hefty 12.5 yard average.
Up front the Spartans are two
deep in every position with
highly experienced personnel.


SPARTAN HALFBACK JOHNNY JOHNSON
In last year's 34-20 San Jose triumph over Stanford, it was swift
Johnson who carried for four of SJS's five touchdowns. The Spar
tan speedster will be out to help extend the San Jose win streak
to two in a row over the Cards Saturday.


SAN JOSE SIGNAL-CALLER CHON GALLEGOS
Stepping into the shoes of graduated Mike Jones, Gallegos has done
a yeoman's job leading the Spartans to a 3-1 mark this season.
Gallegos will be starting at quarterback for San Jose State Satur
day against the Indians.
It was the highlight of the year for San Jose’s surprising Spar
tans when they upset Stanford, 34-20, last season to win the Penin
sula Championship for the first time since 1954.
The Spartans, jealously clinging to that distinction, will field a
team that appears to he stronger than the ’6O squad in every de-

partment but passing. 4
Here Coach Bob Titchenal had
to replace Mike Jones, one of the
finest passers on the Coast last
year. Jones threw for 1049 yards,
a total which ranked the Spar
tans eighth nationally in passing
offense.

Monday. The big senior loads all
Spartan receivers with 11 catches
for 1 (14 yards.
HALFBACK Mac Burton, com
bining speed and agility, presents
another headache for the Cardi
nal secondary. Burton, who led
the team in that department last
year, is second with 152 yards
spread over 10 receptions.
The Spartan backfield will have
good speed in fullback Johnny
Johnson and halfbacks Phil Clif
ton and Burton all better than
10-flat sprinters.
Johnson, a possible All-America
candidate, averaged 5.7 yards per
carry for the Sparts last year and
yards in 49 carries.

Senior Chon Gallegos has
stepped up to take over the sig
nal-calling duties after waiting
in the wings last year. Gallegos
surprised even the most optimis
tic San Jose fans as he led the
Spartans to a 14-13 upset of Brig
ham Young in their opening

game.
IN FOUR OUTINGS the senior
signal-caller has hit the target at
a .575 rate, and his 559 yai’ds is
far ahe a d of the pace set by
Jones. Gallegos has yet to show
that he can throw the long one
and so the passing game will not
be as big a threat as in ’6O.
For receivers the Spartans
have three outstanding ends in
Oscar Donahue, Ray Pena, and
David Chuid. Donahue was the
hero in San Jose’s win over Colo
rado State last weekend as he
caught a 21-yard touchdown pass
from Gallegos and set up another
by blocking a punt on the State
21.
He was named Northern Cali
fornia lineman of the week at
the football writers luncheon

is again up around 5.6 with 275

CLIFTON is the No. 2 man on
the ground, having picked up 194
yards in 41 carries. Clifton, a
senior, didn’t see much action last
year, but the lack of experience
hasn’t held him back.
Burton, at the other half, is
one of the best. A high school
All-American in both track and
football, Mac gave up broad
jumping to concentrate on the
gridiron. He has carried the ball
only four times this year for a
hefty 12.5 yard average.
