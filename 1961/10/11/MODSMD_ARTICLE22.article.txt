# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION

Many people know Larry Royse, but until three weeks ago no
one knew him as a football player. Larry was Stanford student body
president last year and distiguished himself. But his greatest fame
was earned in the last three weeks on the football field.
Royse has that extra something that the fans and his teammates
alike admire- the ability to come up with the big play at the key
moment.
AGAINST TULANE A fine fake by quarterback Chuck Butler
and the explosive speed of Royse combined on a 47-yard touchdown
pass to bring the Tribe back to a 9-7 win, snapping an 11-game
losing streak.
The next week it was Royse again who showed his teammates
that they could do it to Oregon State. After a bruising first half
which saw the hard nosed Card defense fight doggedly to contain

Terry Baker and his friends, a
fantastic overt lie-head reception
by the senior halfback set up the
; first score which got the team
; rolling. Larry’s fine running from
i scrimmage later helped to balance
I the running and passing offense
and enable the Cards to romp past
the befuddled Beaver defense.
But now the guy with the
friendly smile is walking around
in a cast. He sustained a broken
collarbone last Saturday while
j running back a kickoff against
! Michigan State. He is probably
through for the season.
IT HAS BEEN A hard luck foot
ball career for Larry. After hav
: ing been an all-state selection in
|, Arizona in both football and bas
ketball his senior year in high
school and the state broad jump
champion (23 feet), Royse fell
victim to the Asian flu and never

played a minute with the freshman team.
He was such an unknown quantity that he decided to sit out his
sophomore year a process known as red shirting. A player has five
years in which to get in his four years of eligibility and oftentimes
if a boy sits out he grows and becomes more mature with that
extra year.
The next season Larry had a bad knee and pulled leg muscles
and saw only token appearances in four games.
Last year the six-foot, 190-pounder shattered his thumb three
days before the first game. He had three pins in the thumb and was
to be in a cast from four to six months. Larry had come to play and
just three weeks later (he cast came off. He played in the last throe
contests against doctor’s orders with the thumb taped to his hand.
Those who know Royse know how badly he wants to play. Those
who have seen him play this season hope he makes it hack.
