# Three Lortons Head Card Water Poloists
## 
### PETER KING 
Stanford opposition in water
polo is likely to be confused this
season with no fewer than three
men on the Indian squad answer
ing to the name Lorton. This for
midable trio Bob, Jack and Bill
is one of the chief reasons for
coach Jim Gaughran’s outlook for
a successful season.
The brothers, all from Menlo-
Atherton High School, are no
strangers to the game. Bob. a sen
ior and the oldest, has played var
sity for three years and earned
two letters. Last year, as a for
ward, he was the team’s high
scorer.
JACK, also a senior, played

three years of high school water
polo, making all-league in his sen
ior year. He has been on iho Stan
ford team for three years and has
earned two letters in the process.
Bill, a sophomore, was outstand
ing in high school, being on the
all-league team twice. Last year
on the frosh squad, Bill was team
captain and also high scorer.
Jack Lorton was the first of the
brothers to try water polo. Broth
er Bob turned out for it after two
years of high school football.
With both brothers playing, Bill
was more or less forced into the
•sport through family influence.
All three men like football as a
second sport, but agree that water
polo takes up too much lime to
allow for any other sport.

ALTHOUGH this is the first
year the Lot-tons have played to
gether for Stanford, they were on
a summer league team this year.
Asked how being on the same
team affects their play, Bob re
plied, “You get so excited during a
game that often you can’t distin
guish between players on your
own team. I’d say that the chief
result is generally more team
unity.”
Between water polo matches,
Bob finds time to study his major,
economics. Jack is majoring in
radio and television, while Bill is
undecided. All three belong to Al
pha Delta Phi.

Stanford opposition in water
polo is likely to be confused this
season with no fewer than three
men on the Indian squad answer
ing to the name Lorton. This for
midable trio Bob, Jack and Bill
is one of the chief reasons for
coach Jim Gaughran’s outlook for
a successful season.
The brothers, all from Menlo-
Atherton High School, are no
strangers to the game. Bob. a sen
ior and the oldest, has played var
sity for three years and earned
two letters. Last year, as a for
ward, he was the team’s high
scorer.
JACK, also a senior, played

three years of high school water
polo, making all-league in his sen
ior year. He has been on iho Stan
ford team for three years and has
earned two letters in the process.
Bill, a sophomore, was outstand
ing in high school, being on the
all-league team twice. Last year
on the frosh squad, Bill was team
captain and also high scorer.
Jack Lorton was the first of the
brothers to try water polo. Broth
er Bob turned out for it after two
years of high school football.
With both brothers playing, Bill
was more or less forced into the
•sport through family influence.
All three men like football as a
second sport, but agree that water
polo takes up too much lime to
allow for any other sport.

ALTHOUGH this is the first
year the Lot-tons have played to
gether for Stanford, they were on
a summer league team this year.
Asked how being on the same
team affects their play, Bob re
plied, “You get so excited during a
game that often you can’t distin
guish between players on your
own team. I’d say that the chief
result is generally more team
unity.”
