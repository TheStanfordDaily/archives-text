# Serra Scores 19-0 Victory In Murals
## 
### 
In yesterday’s top intramural
touch football contest, Serra I
scored a lopsided 19-0 victory over
Fremont. Boh Notter, Hal John
son and Doug Rippito did the
scoring damage for Serra.
Soto I scored a 6-0 win over
Junipero I in a hard fought game,
and Law I ran wild over Alpha
Biz to the tune of 35-6 in other
games.
Breakers I and Cuadro played
to a 0-0 tie with Cuadro getting
the nod by yardage gained in a
playoff. Delt I and Fiji I also
fought to a 0-0 deadlock before
the Belts won in a yardage play
off to complete the day’s action.
