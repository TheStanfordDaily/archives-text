football already has turned up a
flock of surprises the pre-season
soothsayers couldn’t see in their
murky crystal balls.
Top trends:
1. Power is spread over a wide
area; there are more good teams
than the forecasters supposed.
2. Offenses are better than ever
and the switch to more and
tougher defense hasn’t developed.
The scramble for places in the
nation’s top ]() is wide open since
the early going deflated such
touted teams as Kansas, UCLA,
Rice, Penn State and Syracuse.
Additionally, Ohio State was tied
by Texas Christ ian and lowa bare
ly scratched out a 35-34 victory
over Southern California—neither
performance being deemed wor
thy of Big Ten giants expected to
duel for national as well as con
ference honors.
And up popped the surprises
that’ll have plenty to say about
how league titles or bowl bids are
lined up in November with Michi
gan, Michigan State, Notre Dame,
Washington and, in its class, Ivy
League Dartmouth heading the
list of teams that didn’t figure at
the start.
