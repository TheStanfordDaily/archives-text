## Work Hits All Corners of SU 
### GREGG HOPKINS Contributing’ Editor 
Seven million dollars is on its
way to various Bay Area con
tractors, architects and outfitters
to pay for current and recently
completed construction on the
Farm. This amount includes ma
jor building projects and small
renovations in all parts of the
campus.
In addition (o Tresidder Memo
rial Union and Undergraduate
Housing Unit No. 1 Ihe first fra
ternity cluster -major works in
process of being built are the
Russell H. Varian physics build
ing and a general office building.
Summer remodeling work, now
complete and in use, includes a
$51,000 renovation of Quad Room
320 in the Geology Department,
The large lecture hall, untouched
to all appearances since its con
struction in the early days of the
century, has been refloored (after
rebuilding of the floor risers),
re-ceilinged. re decorated and has
had new furnishings and fixtures
installed.
THE BASEMENT of Cuhber
ley, long a dank, dismal haunt
of wan psych grad students and
the subjects of their experiments,
presents a new, bright face after
a renovation project in which
$174,128 was spent to provide new
office and experiment space for
the Psychology Department.
What formerly was unused stor
age space is now offices and lab
spaces.
North of the Quad in the vener
able chemistry building, $85,000
was expended during the past
few months, mainly to revitalize
the formerly cramped, inadequate
chem libe. This project, officials
report, will be finished by Nov. 1,
with the arrival of library fix
tures.
THE VARIAN physics building
going up across from the present
Physics Corner will cost $2.5 mil
lion when completely equipped
and will bo finished about July
1, according to L. F. Stark, con
struction manager in the Univer
sity’s Business Office.

Varian is now a month behind
schedule, he added, due partially
to difficulty in obtaining a proper
high density aggregate for shield
ing concrete for one area of the
building.
Strikes, notably the plumbers’
and one in the steel industry, have
also held up construction on most
of the campus projects, Stark
said.

BEING OCCUPIED in stages
is the $342,000 general offices
building located behind Electron
ics Research Laboratories in the
science area west of Lom i t a
Drive. Designed and built by the
local firm of Eichler Homes, this
building will be first used as
offices by the Math and Statistics
departments and the ICAME
project of the Graduate School
of Businesss.

The offices are planned to alle
viate the crush for space now on
throughout the University. As
permanent facilities for the pres
ent tenants are built, the offices
will be available to other men
and projects in need of working
space.

Off campus, remodeling has
recently boon in progress at Stan
ford’s Hopkins Marine Station in
Pacific Grove. One hundred thou
sand dollars has been spent to
modernize and restore laboratory
space.
ALSO FINISHED is the Pine
Hill No. 2 faculty housing area
subdivision. Streets, sidewalks
and utilities are in. Stark said.
Only the fire alarm boxes, acci
dentally installed with their “pull
handle-to-break-glass” sides fac
ing backwards out into the mud
need to bo turned so they’ll be
usable for reporting fires, he
said.

Projects set to begin soon, ac
cording to Royal Tyson of the
University Planning Office, in
clude a $700,000 remodeling job
on the Engineering Research
Labs, buildings 500-520, between
Quad and Panama Street. Part of
the PACE program, the work
