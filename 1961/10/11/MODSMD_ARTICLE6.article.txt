# Devening Elected Head of Pre-Reg
## 
### 
Randy Devening has been elect
ed chairman of the Pre-Reg Com
mission. He will be assisted by
Marvie Knox as co-chairman.
For the first time, the new
chairmanâ€™s duties will begin this
year with the handling of winter
and spring quarter transfer stu
dents rather than with the fresh
man pre-reg program in the fall.
Tryouts for committee members
will be held in the middle of win
ter quarter rather than in April
as in past years, Devening said.
This is to obtain more time to
plan the frosh orientation.

Forty-two members, chosen in
equal numbers from the fresh
man, sophomore and Junior
classes, will be selected at that
time.
