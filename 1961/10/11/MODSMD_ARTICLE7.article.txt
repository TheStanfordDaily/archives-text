LONDON (UPD—Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and
British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan yesterday held what they
described as “useful’’ talks on the Berlin crisis. But authoritative
diplomatic sources said they made no progress toward East-West
negotiations on a Berlin settlement.
Macmillan met with Gromyko for one hour and 40 minutes at
Gromyko’s request. Gromyko was making a 24-hour stopover in
London on his way hack to Moscow to report to Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev on his talks with President Kennedy in Washington.
An official statement from the British Foreign Office said the
talks between Macmillan and Gromyko covered the “same ground”
as the Soviet foreign minister’s talks in Washington. No progress was
reported in the Washington talks.
Following the meeting, Gromyko told newsmen that he had the
“general impression” after his talks here and in Washington that
“there is growing understanding between ourselves.”
“Everything must be done try the responsible governments, that
is the groat powers, to avoid a collision and find a peaceful solution
of the outstanding problems,” Gromyko said.
The British Foreign Office said “the prime minister expressed
the hope that these useful discussions would be continued.” Gromyko
also described the conversations as “very useful.”
But authoritative diplomatic sources said no progress was made
and no change in the respective East-West positions on Berlin
resulted.

accompanied by Soviet Ambassador to London Ajcksandpr Soldatov
and Deputy Foreign Minister V. M, Semeyonov.
