# Who Writes What In Stanford's Daily
## 
### 
A number of people have asked us to clarify who writes what
on The Daily editorial pages, which normally are pages 2 and 3 in
a six-page paper and page 2 in a four-page paper.
In the space where this editorial appears will be found all Daily
editorials. They are written by the editor 99 per cent of the time.
Occasionally, a member of the editorial board will write an editorial
which gives his view—normally concurred in by the editor.
We hope letters to the editor and Walter Lippmann’s column
are self-explanatory.
Also appearing in the editorial pages, as in today’s Daily, are
personal opinion columns written by staff members. These are
labeled “stall opinion” in a headline and reflect the writer’s views
and not necessarily those of The Daily.
A good example of these staff columns appears today, with a
liberal column on page 2, and a conservative column on page 3.
From time to time, various students on campus who are not
Daily staffers will submit, or be asked to submit, columns on cer
tain issues. One of these also is published today on this page. These
columns, again, reflect the writer’s opinion and not necessarily those
of The Daily, and are marked in a headline as “campus opinion.”
And, finally, The Daily on occasion runs news analysis articles
written by United Press International reporters. These, too, give
the writer’s opinion and may, or may not, reflect The Daily’s feel
ing on the subject.
Our job is to try, in this way, to present as many views as pos
sible. It’s up to the reader to accept or reject what he wishes.
