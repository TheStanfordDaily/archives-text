I suppose October 12 is just another day to you. You get up in
the ordinary way and do all the ordinary things you ordinarily
do. You have your breakfast, you walk your ocelot, you go to
classes, you write home for money, you burn the dean in effigy,
you watch Howdy-Doody, and you go to bed. And do you give
one little thought to the fact that October 12 is Columbus
Day? No, you do not.
Nobody thinks about Columbus these days. Let us, there
fore, pause for a moment and retell his ever-glorious, endlessly
stirring saga.
Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa on August 25,1451.
His father, Ralph T. Columbus, was in the three-minute auto
wasli game. His mother, Eleanor (Swifty) Columbus, was a
sprinter. Christopher was an only child, except for his four
brothers and eight sisters. With his father busy all day at the
auto wash and his mother constantly away at track meets,
young Columbus was left pretty much to his own devices.
However, the lad did not sulk or brood. He was an avid reader
and spent all his waking hours immersed in a book. Unfortu
nately, there was only one book in Genoa at the time— Care of
the Horse by Aristotle—and after several years of reading Care
of the Horse, Columbus grew restless. Ho when rumor reached
him that there was another book in Barcelona, off he ran as
fast as his fat little legs would carry him.
The rumor, alas, proved false. The only book in Barcelona
was Cnidar tin Cahallo by Aristotle, which proved to be nothing
more than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.
Bitterly disappointed, Columbus began to dream of going
to India where, according to legend, there were thousands of
books. But the only way to go to India was on horseback, and
after so many years of reading Care of the Horse, Columbus
never wanted to clap eyes on a horse again. Then a new thought
struck him: perhaps it was possible to get to India by sea!
Fired with his revolutionary new idea, Columbus raced to
the court of Ferdinand and Isabella on his little fat legs (Colum
bus, though six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs all his
life) and pleaded his case with such fervor that the rulers tVere
persuaded.
On October 12, 1492, Columbus set foot on the New World,
The following year he returned to Spain with a cargo of wonders
never before seen in Europe—spices and metals and plants and
flowers and—most wondrous of all—tobacco! Oh, what a sensa
tion tobacco caused in Europe! The filter had long since been
invented (by Aristotle, curiously enough) but nobody knew
what to do with it. Now Columbus, the Great Discoverer,
made still another great discovery: he took a filter, put tobacco
in front of it, and invented the world's first filter igarette!
Through the centuries filters have been steadily improved
and so has tobacco, until today we have achieved the ultimate
in the filter cigarette—Marlboro, of course! Oh, what a piece
of work is Marlboro! Great tobacco, great filter, great smoke!
And so, good friends, when next you enjoy a fine Marlboro
Cigarette, give a thought to the plucky Genoese, Christopher
Columbus, whose vision and perseverance made the whole
lovely thing possible. © IMI M „ Hhulm , n
