ERASE WITHOUT A TRACE
ON EATON’S CORRASABLE BOND
Touch-type, hunt-and-peck, type with one hand tied
behind your back—it’s easy to turn out perfect papers
on Corrasable. Because you can erase without a trace.
Typing errors disappear like magic with just the flick of
an ordinary pencil eraser.There’s never a telltale erasure
mark on Corrasable’s special surface.
Corrasable is available in light,
medium, heavy weights and Onion
Skin. In convenient 100-sheet
packets and 500-sheet ream
boxes. Only Eaton makes
Corrasable.
