# S. Viet Nam Threat, Berlin Deadlock Top JFK Confab
## 
### 
WASHINGTON ( UPl)—President Kennedy yesterday ordered
Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor former Army chief of staff, to the Far East
to help draft defense plans for meeting the increased Communist

threat to South Viet Nam.
Turning to a second crisis on the other side of the world, the

■President also said his recent talk
with Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko produced no im
mediate hope of an easy settle
ment to the East-West deadlock
in Berlin.

THE TWIX developments came
at a news conference during which
the Chief Executive summed up
the international situation by de
claring that “We happen to live
in the most dangerous time in the
history of the human race.”
The crises came shortly after:

1 ) The government ordered an
other 10,000 troops to Europe in
the event of a Berlin showdown,
and 2) The President called Gen.
James A. Van Fleet out of re
tirement to help train U.S. troops
in guerilla warfare.
KENNEDY announced that Gen.
Taylor would meet in Saigon with
Viet-Namese President Ngo Dinh
Liem and U.S. officials to thresh
out “on the spit” means of coun
tering intensified attacks on South
Viet Nam by North Viet-Namese
Communists.

There have been reports that
the United States was considering
sending U.S. troops to the Far
East, but the State Department
denied any action was imminent
and the President said he would
wait for Taylor’s “educated mili
tary guess” before taking action
of any kind.

On Berlin, the President said
there was no sign of any clear
solution to the German problem
despite the meetings he and Rusk
have held with Gromyko. As the
Chief Executive put it: “In sub
stance, we are not in sight of
land.”
THE PRESIDENT said consul
tation with the Russians on the
Berlin crisis would be renewed by
U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn
Thompson upon his return to Mos
cow. But he emphasized that these
talks would be “exploratory” and
should not be regarded as nego
tiations.

Asked if a tax increase might
be sought to help pay for the
U.S. military buildup, he said this
would depend on the military sit
uation and whether Congress ap
proves such revenue-raising meas
ures as a postal rate hike.

despite the meetings he and Rusk
have held with Gromyko. As the
Chief Executive put it: “In sub
stance, we are not in sight of
land.”
THE PRESIDENT said consul
tation with the Russians on the
Berlin crisis would be renewed by
U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn
Thompson upon his return to Mos
cow. But he emphasized that these
talks would be “exploratory” and
should not be regarded as nego
tiations.

Asked if a tax increase might
be sought to help pay for the
U.S. military buildup, he said this
would depend on the military sit
uation and whether Congress ap
proves such revenue-raising meas
ures as a postal rate hike.
WASHINGTON ( UPl)—President Kennedy yesterday ordered
Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor former Army chief of staff, to the Far East
to help draft defense plans for meeting the increased Communist

threat to South Viet Nam.
Turning to a second crisis on the other side of the world, the

■President also said his recent talk
with Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko produced no im
mediate hope of an easy settle
ment to the East-West deadlock
in Berlin.

THE TWIX developments came
at a news conference during which
the Chief Executive summed up
the international situation by de
claring that “We happen to live
in the most dangerous time in the
history of the human race.”
The crises came shortly after:

1 ) The government ordered an
other 10,000 troops to Europe in
the event of a Berlin showdown,
and 2) The President called Gen.
James A. Van Fleet out of re
tirement to help train U.S. troops
in guerilla warfare.
KENNEDY announced that Gen.
Taylor would meet in Saigon with
Viet-Namese President Ngo Dinh
Liem and U.S. officials to thresh
out “on the spit” means of coun
tering intensified attacks on South
Viet Nam by North Viet-Namese
Communists.

There have been reports that
the United States was considering
sending U.S. troops to the Far
East, but the State Department
denied any action was imminent
and the President said he would
wait for Taylor’s “educated mili
tary guess” before taking action
of any kind.

On Berlin, the President said
there was no sign of any clear
solution to the German problem
despite the meetings he and Rusk
have held with Gromyko. As the
Chief Executive put it: “In sub
stance, we are not in sight of
land.”
