# STAFF OPINION
## U.S. Communist Party Substituted for JBS 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
A columnist in yesterday’s Daily
attempted to defend the John
Birch Society. Following is a con
densation of that column (in
many cases using the columnist’s
exact words) with one basic inno
vation: The Communist Party of
the U.S. (CPUSA) is substituted
for the Birch Society. This innova
tion logically necessitates other
changes, which are made accord
ingly.
The purpose is to indicate that
the same reasoning the columnist
uses to defend the Birch Society
and to deprecate the U.S. Com
munists can be used to defend
the U.S. Communists and to dep
recate the Birch Society. Certain
departures will be made from the
condensation in order to clarify
points and to counter objections
before they take the form of let
ters to the editor.
Responsible Americans have
been asking, “What is CPUSA?”
Unfortunately, the press hasn’t
been very helpful in providing the
answer.
INSTEAD OF giving objective
information, newspapers have
been the vanguard for slanderous
attacks on the organization.
The image of CPUSA that the
press has conjured up is that of
a semi-secret, anti-civil liberties
organization, whose members,
chiefly retired laborers and intel
lectual malcontents, spy on their
neighbors, libel public officials,
and even occasionally accuse each
other of “Birchist” leanings.
Specifically, the conservative
objections to CPUSA are as fol
lows:
OBJECTION 1: CPUSA is a
semi-secret organization. This be
lief stems from the fact that the
party’s leader refuses to make
public either financial statements
or membership lists. The society
considers this policy to avoid
“Birchist” infiltration.
Are these provisions sufficient
to brand the party semi-secret? I
think not. Members are free to
acknowledge their affiliation, in
vite guests to meetings, and
speak openly on the activities of
the society, as they frequently do.
OBJECTION 2; CPUSA is part
of the international Communist
conspiracy being directed by Mos
cow. This charge, arising from
the mistaken belief that Khrush
chev rules the organization with
an iron hand and dictates con
formity among its members, is
completely without justification
either in the structure of the so
ciety or in its stated principles.
(First departure: Clearly my
statement is contestable. It ap
pears that Khrushchev may con
trol CPUSA, in spite of what I
say. It is equally true that Welch
may control the Birch Society, in
spite of what our columnist says).
OBJECTION 3: CPUSA uses
such methods as telephone tap
ping and spying to uncover “Birch
ists.” One cell in Kansas is report
ed to have done this, but the
party consists of several hundred
cells, each of which determines
the nature of its own activities.
(Second departure: Not many
people believe this and there is
good reason. CPUSA is anti-capi
talistic. It uses spying and tele
phone tapping to destroy capital
ism.
The Birch Society is anti-com
munistic. It uses spying and tele
phone tapping to destroy Com
munism.
If a Communist is caught spy
ing or tapping a telephone, people
are quick to vilify all Communists.
If all the U.S. Communists were
to shout in unison that they abhor
telephone tapping and spying, no
one would believe them.
After all, one of their members
was caught doing just what they
are denouncing. Shouldn’t the
same principle apply to the John
Birch Society? Simply, the Birch
Society resorts to the principle of
guilt by association. The same
principle can be turned on them.)
I hope my point is clear. Using

our columnist’s reasoning, it is
evident that Communism is de
fended and Birchism is degraded,
exactly the opposite of our erst
while columnist’s intention.

I have not been motivated by a
desire to defend Communism or
degrade Birchism. My object has
been to prove that our columnist’s
logic is devoid of consistency,
since he most certainly wouldn’t
use the same reasoning to defend
the Communists as he used to de
fend the John Birch Society.
CONSERVATIVES are quick to
criticize the inconsistencies of the
liberal philosophy. As I have tried
to prove, conservatives can also
be very inconsistent, not only in
regard to the John Birch Society,
but on other matters as well. I
shall try to explain these other in
consistencies tomorrow.
