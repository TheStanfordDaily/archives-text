Editor, The Daily:
I have no desire to belabor the
argument between Mr. Hermann,
Dan Cullen and myself. But I can
not ignore Mr. Cullen’s attack on
my letter in defense of Carl Brad
en, just as Carl Braden could not
ignore Kentucky’s, and later the
HUAC’s, attack upon his constitu
tional civil liberties.
First, I strongly challenge Mr.
Cullen’s entirely undocumented
statement that Carl Braden is an
“identified Communist.” I cannot
state unequivocally that he is not,
because he has chosen, on prin
ciple, to refute the right of cer
tain groups even to make that in
quiry; neither can I allow Mr.
Cullen’s foundationless accusation
to go unchallenged.

Second, U.S. News is perfectly
correct. “Police raided the Braden
and Ford homes ...”

From the Ford home, Anne
Braden explained, the police
“netted boxloads of Communist
literature.” From the Bradens’
own extensive and varied library,
she continued, they took those
books which would be instrumen
tal in a conviction, books by Marx
and Lenin and subversive pam
phlets.
Furthermore, if it is Mr. Cul
len’s contention, as it was Ken
tucky’s, that such hooks could be
found in a Communist’s library,
then I and two of my political sci
ence professors had better be ap
prehended immediately.

Thirdly, it certainly was my im
plication that Kentucky over
looked its responsibilities under
law. I supported this charge as
thoroughly as space permitted.
My point was that Louisville had
a vested interest in protecting its
prejudiced citizens, citizens in
censed to the point that there was
reason to believe they resorted to
overt violence to keep one of their
exclusive neighborhoods pure and
white.
Finally, as “close to the scene”
as the grand jury was, there is
significance in those details of
the bombing which they deliber
ately overlooked, for instance the
police statement soon after the
bombing that a man had con
fessed.

ciple, to refute the right of cer
tain groups even to make that in
quiry; neither can I allow Mr.
Cullen’s foundationless accusation
to go unchallenged.

Second, U.S. News is perfectly
correct. “Police raided the Braden
and Ford homes ...”

From the Ford home, Anne
Braden explained, the police
“netted boxloads of Communist
literature.” From the Bradens’
own extensive and varied library,
she continued, they took those
books which would be instrumen
tal in a conviction, books by Marx
and Lenin and subversive pam
phlets.
Furthermore, if it is Mr. Cul
len’s contention, as it was Ken
tucky’s, that such hooks could be
found in a Communist’s library,
then I and two of my political sci
ence professors had better be ap
prehended immediately.

Thirdly, it certainly was my im
plication that Kentucky over
looked its responsibilities under
law. I supported this charge as
thoroughly as space permitted.
My point was that Louisville had
a vested interest in protecting its
prejudiced citizens, citizens in
censed to the point that there was
reason to believe they resorted to
overt violence to keep one of their
exclusive neighborhoods pure and
white.
Finally, as “close to the scene”
as the grand jury was, there is
significance in those details of
the bombing which they deliber
ately overlooked, for instance the
police statement soon after the
bombing that a man had con
fessed.

Editor, The Daily:
I have no desire to belabor the
argument between Mr. Hermann,
Dan Cullen and myself. But I can
not ignore Mr. Cullen’s attack on
my letter in defense of Carl Brad
en, just as Carl Braden could not
ignore Kentucky’s, and later the
HUAC’s, attack upon his constitu
tional civil liberties.
First, I strongly challenge Mr.
Cullen’s entirely undocumented
statement that Carl Braden is an
“identified Communist.” I cannot
state unequivocally that he is not,
because he has chosen, on prin
ciple, to refute the right of cer
tain groups even to make that in
quiry; neither can I allow Mr.
Cullen’s foundationless accusation
to go unchallenged.
