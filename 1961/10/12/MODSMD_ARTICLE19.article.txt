### 
BERLIN (UPI) The U.S.
Army yesterday held a snap alert
exercise to test defenses against
Communist attack, rolling armor
ed troop carriers to key West
Berlin installations.

West Berlin police officials
meanwhile discussed issuing
American semi-automatic M-l
rifles to their patrolmen on the
East-West border. The United
States stockpiled the M-l’s here to
match the automatic weapons car

ried by Communist police.
The alert was staged by the Ist 1
Battle Group, 18th Infantry, the
unit President Kennedy ordered to
Berlin in August to reinforce the
other two battle groups here.
Another phase of (he American
buildup began yesterday in Cher
bourg, France, when the 500-man

vanguard of the 40,000 troops to
be sent to Europe arrived. An
other 1,500 men aboard the same
transport will reach Germany to
day.
An Army spokesman described
the Berlin alert as “a routine op
erational readiness test which is
part of normal training.”
