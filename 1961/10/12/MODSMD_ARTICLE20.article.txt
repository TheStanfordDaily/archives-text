Editor, The Daily:
I was elated to read about the
decision to teach an objective
course in Communism in the Cali
fornia Public Schools. I tremble
with excitement when I think of
the potentialities of such a pro
gram.
First we could teach an objec
tive course on the evil Communist
and Socialist conspiracies that
threaten our homes, our lives and
our God and which have already
condemned the miserable down
trodden Russian people to an eter
nity of abject slavery.
Then we could teach an objec
tive course in the beauty and po

('try—nay, the divinity—nf free
enterprise and the profit motive
which have made our country the
true spokesman and practitioner
of liberty, justice and purity of
motive.
Finally, and this is most im
portant, we could teach our chil
dren of the insidious way in which
the Communists indoctrinate their
youth.
