# AT STADIUM SATURDAY
## Cards Take on SJS 
### 
The honeymoon may well be
over for Cactus Jack Curtice and
his Stanford varsity as they try
to recuperate from the Michigan
State bruising in time to face an
improved San Jose Slate team.
'They square off Saturday in the
Stadium.

The sophomore-studded Cards
rejuvenated football interest on
the Farm earlier this year as they
managed to put two victories back
to bark for some sort of a modern
era record. But now, just one
week later the picture has
changed. The Cards have lost two
and possibly three key men, and
what’s more the other Big Five
teams are showing unexpected

strength.
LARRY ROYSE, a senior half
back who was a key man in the
two wins, has been lost for at
least five weeks with a broken col
larbone, suffered at the hands of
MSU last weekend. His absence
costs the Indians their most dan
gerous runner and pass receiver.
Also on the shelf after the Mich
igan State game are Hal Steuber
and Steve Pursell. Steuber, the
squad’s number one fullback and
one of its best linebackers, suf
fered a broken Jaw and is lost for
at least six weeks,
Pursell has a severely strained
instep which has slowed him down
considerably, but Trainer Connie
Jarvis hints that he may be ready
to go Saturday.
THERE WERE a few bright
notes coming out of Jarvis’ office
this week though. Tim Hansel,
who tore some ligaments in his
knee before the season even start
ed, has been pronounced physical
ly sound and has resumed work
outs. The sophomore halfback
may start contact next week and
could possibly make the trip to
his home town, Seattle, for the
Washington game.
Steve Thurlow, promising soph
omore quarterback who had to
leave the MSU game with a strain
ed shoulder, is okay and has been
throwing easily in practice all
week.'

Curtice has made a few changes

to compensate for the weakened
positions. Sophomore Chuck Mc-
Cormick has been moved over to
left end in case Pursell can’t make
it on Saturday. McCormick, a
deadly blocker and outstanding
defensive player, has been show
ing steady improvement and will
probably see considerable action
against the Spartans.

JIM SMITH, a junior quarter
back who did not play last year,
has been alternating with Gary

Craig at left half on the first unit
this week. Smith is a fine all
around athlete and should adapt
to the new position easily. Craig
will undoubtedly get the call, but
without Royse the Cards are dan
gerously thin at this spot.
San Jose Coach Bob Titchenal
reports happily that his Spartans
are at full strength with the re
turn of tackle Jim Cadile to the
lineup.
End of medical report.

Stanford lost the game 31-3 as the mammoth MSU platoons wore
down Cactus Jack Curtice's charges. The Tribe hosts San Jose State
on Saturday.
