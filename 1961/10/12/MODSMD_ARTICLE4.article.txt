half of his body.
The administration of a cancer
remission drug, “Fluoro-Uracil”
had to be discontinued yesterday
after three daily doses because of
the pneumonia.

drug treatment wall be resumed
as soon as the pneumonia is un

to be listed as critical.
Dr. Short asked Rayburn how
he felt. Rayburn said he didn’t
know.

prolong his life weeks or months
so he could return to his home at
Bonham, Tex., to spend his last
days.
