# Hurdle Passed In Ford, UAW 8-Day Strike
## 
### 
DETROIT OIPI) The Ford
Motor Co. and the United Auto
Workers Union last night reached
agreement on a full master na
tional contract and the strike
bound company may be back in
full production by next Monday.
“We hope to resume full opera
tions by Monday,” union President
Walter P. Rent her said.
THE UAVV international execu
tive board was to meet later last
night and was expected to recom
mend that the union’s national
board council approve the new
three-year pact with the world’s
second largest auto maker.
The agreement, however, would
not necessarily end the eight-day
old strike against Ford because
there still were 25 local plant
agreements to be resolved. About
60,000 workers remained affected
by the 25 local disputes.
But the big hurdle was cleared
last night when the UAW and
Ford reached accord on the last
two national issues production
standards and union representa
tion. Money matters were not at
stake. They were agreed to last
week just before the strike started
on Tuesday.

WHKN ASKKD about the non
economic agreement reached last
night, Denise said, “I don’t think
it will be a rock around our neck.”
Denise also said Ford “will do
everything possible to achieve a
quick settlement of local issues
outstanding.”
The 25 remaining local units
which haven’t settled with Ford
probably will be given approval
to continue on strike.
HK SAID that the council and
the executive board would “re
view” the local contracts still un
settled and make a judgment as
to whether their problems were
great enough to continue their
walkouts.
