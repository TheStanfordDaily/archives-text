# Fear of Life Brought Us Death, Says Pacifist
## 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
“We have become so afraid of being alive that we have died.”
This was the basic assertion of Brewster Kneen, secretary of the
pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation, in his talk on “The Reality

of Nuclear Annihilation” last night.
Kneen termed “the reduction of society to a subhuman basis

’whe v e death has no significance
nor does life” as the different sort
of death created by the acceptance
of the reality of nuclear annihila
tion by a generation raised in the
nuclear era.
“WHAT DO WE have to offer
future generations?” the intense
young speaker asked. “Can any
body live a creative life?”
Kneen answered his own ques
tion by giving several proposals
for reincarnating the dead human
society. He called for man to “re
member we are human beings be
fore we are anything else.”

This demands the end of the
search for national, economic and
personal security. For the individ
ual it means acting as a member
of humanity and making his views
known. Kneen strongly advo
cated letter writing, saying, “Your
silence is a vote for someone you
probably disagree with.”
He called such actions as the
peace march to Moscow, “activ
ism, very good in itself, but not
enough when people begin to
think it is a substitute for every
thing else.”
GIVING SPECIFIC examples
where the individual can make
himself heard, Kneen called for
action in these areas: Cuba—end
our embargo and try to help the
Cuban people develop a society of
which they can bo proud; China—
stop punishing the people for their
government and send surplus food
to starving Chinese; Berlin—ex
press concern for both East and
West Germany, for all of man
kind, and stop talking in terms of
nuclear war. “Why,” he demanded,
“do we expect Russia to take the
moral step first?”
Kneen terms his philosophy ba
sically a religious one. He became
a pacifist only after two years of
service in the U.S. Navy.
