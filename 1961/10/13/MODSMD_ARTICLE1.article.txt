# Crippled Stanford Tackles Spartans
## 
### ROY SCHMIDT Sports Editor 
Stanford’s battered and taped
Indians will be out to regain the
Peninsula Football Championship
tomorrow when they square off
against San Jose at the Stadium.
Kick-off time is 1:30 p.m.
The Indians, perennial holders
of the local title, lost it last season
after reigning for a six-year
period.

STANFORD was already crip
pled by a host of injuries from
last weekend and Coach Jack Cur
tice got another dose of bad news
today. Errol Scott, number one
right guard, has.cracked a rib in
practice and will not start against
the Spartans. Scott has done an
outstanding job for the Cards all
year long and ranks among the
leaders in tackles with 15.

Sophomore Frank Dubofsky,
who has spelled Scott most of the
season, will open in his place. The
218-pound youngster has great re
flexes and is tough to fool.
The Cards will take the field
minus three other regulars—end
Stove Pur-sell, halfback Larry
Royse, and fullback Hal Steuber,
Steuber and Royse are out for at
least five weeks with fractures,
but Pursell may see some action
tomorrow. The big senior is still
favoring a, strained instep and will
not be among the starters.
FRANK PATITUCCI, another
sophomore, will start in his place.
Patitucci has caught only one pass
all year but has been stubborn on
defense and intercepted an aerial
against Michigan State.
Gary Craig, who alternated with
Royse for the first three games,
will get the call at left half. Craig
has been a workhouse for the In
dians, having carried the ball
more than any other Card, 19
times, for a 3.92-yard average.
JUNIOR FLASH Danny Spence
will start at the other halfback
spot for the first time this year.
Spence has not played much but
showed great promise during
spring practice. He has good
speed and agility and will be a
strong threat to the outside.
Ed Cummings, who has played
a Jot of defense for the Cards this
year, will get his chance at carry
ing the ball tomorrow when he
takes over at fullback for Steuber.
THE ONLY other change in the
Stanford lineup of last week will
be at quarterback whore Rod

Royse for the first three games,
will get the call at left half. Craig
has been a workhouse for the In
dians, having carried the ball
more than any other Card, 19
times, for a 3.92-yard average.
JUNIOR FLASH Danny Spence
will start at the other halfback
spot for the first time this year.
Spence has not played much but
showed great promise during
spring practice. He has good
speed and agility and will be a
strong threat to the outside.
Ed Cummings, who has played
a Jot of defense for the Cards this
year, will get his chance at carry
ing the ball tomorrow when he
takes over at fullback for Steuber.
THE ONLY other change in the
Stanford lineup of last week will
be at quarterback whore Rod
(Continued on page 3, col. I)
Stanford’s battered and taped
Indians will be out to regain the
Peninsula Football Championship
tomorrow when they square off
against San Jose at the Stadium.
Kick-off time is 1:30 p.m.
The Indians, perennial holders
of the local title, lost it last season
after reigning for a six-year
period.

STANFORD was already crip
pled by a host of injuries from
last weekend and Coach Jack Cur
tice got another dose of bad news
today. Errol Scott, number one
right guard, has.cracked a rib in
practice and will not start against
the Spartans. Scott has done an
outstanding job for the Cards all
year long and ranks among the
leaders in tackles with 15.

Sophomore Frank Dubofsky,
who has spelled Scott most of the
season, will open in his place. The
218-pound youngster has great re
flexes and is tough to fool.
The Cards will take the field
minus three other regulars—end
Stove Pur-sell, halfback Larry
Royse, and fullback Hal Steuber,
Steuber and Royse are out for at
least five weeks with fractures,
but Pursell may see some action
tomorrow. The big senior is still
favoring a, strained instep and will
not be among the starters.
FRANK PATITUCCI, another
sophomore, will start in his place.
Patitucci has caught only one pass
all year but has been stubborn on
defense and intercepted an aerial
against Michigan State.
Gary Craig, who alternated with
Royse for the first three games,
will get the call at left half. Craig
has been a workhouse for the In
dians, having carried the ball
more than any other Card, 19
times, for a 3.92-yard average.
