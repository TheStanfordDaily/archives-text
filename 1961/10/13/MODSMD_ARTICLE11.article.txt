# U S. Garrison Will Hold Maneuvers to Test Berlin Defense
## 
### 
BERLIN (UPD—The U.S. Army I
announced yesterday that 3,000
combat troops will stage extensive
exercises in West Berlin next
week to demonstrate American
firmness in the face of bolder
Communist moves and increasing
East German police incursions.
Communist police shot a West
German reporter in the stomach
and kidnaped him yesterday at
Gifhorn on the West German bor
der. Ton others invaded West Ber
lin early Thursday in search of the
four Communist police who de
fected during the night.
TENSION FEARED last night
at the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint
—the only East Berlin entry point
still open to the Allies. An Ameri
can staff car entered the crossing
point just as a West Beilin loud
speaker opened up. It was feared
for a moment the Communists
would close the border there but
moments later they waved the of
ficial car through.
A crowd of 200 watched the
West Berlin war of nerves ma
neuver.
Shortly after nightfall another
200 West Germans assembled at
the Overbaum Bridge near which
West Berliners recently erected a
wooden cross in memory of two
unknown East Berliners who died
in the Spree Canal while trying to
escape from East Berlin.
THE COMMUNISTS attempted
to frighten the crowd away by
bringing up a water cannon truck.
The crowd became unruly then
and several score voices joined in
the cry of “murderers, murder
ers.” The Communists threw two
or three tear gas grenades and
turned on a searchlight.
West Berlin police arrived at
this point and dispersed the crowd
Without difficulty.
The U.S. Army said 3.000 troops
would take part in the maneuvers
in which one of three crack Ber
lin combat battle groups will play
the role of Communist aggressors
while a second defends the West
ern sectors of the city. The ma
neuvers will be held Oct. 18-20.
THE GKUNEWAED Forest and

Berlin waterways spanned by
some 500 bridges will be the areas
for the exercises.
“Unlike most field training ex
ercises this will be a two-sided
free maneuver,” Brig. Gen. Fred
erick O. Hartel, U.S. Berlin troop
commandant said. “We will allow
commanders maximum freedom
within safety rules and the limita
tions of a somewhat restricted
maneuver area.”

The shooting incident was re
ported by the Dortmund news
paper Westfaelische Rundschau
which said its chief reporter Kurt
Lichtenstein was shot in the stom
ach and then dragged across the
border into the Soviet Zone.

IT SAID Lichtenstein had gone
to the border near the town of
Gifhorn and was talking with an
East German farm laborer when
a Communist policeman opened
fire from 70 yards, hitting him in
the stomach.

Another policeman dashed
across the border road into West
Germany, grabbed the fallen re
porter and dragged him back to
the Communist side.
IN THE BERLIN incident the

10 policemen boldly crossed the
boi’der but retreated when seven
Western policemen and a police
dog rushed to the border area and
demanded they leave.

Allied officials privately ex
pressed satisfaction with West
German handling of the incident
without bloodshed though it was
regarded as one of the most se
rious of a series of incidents since
the Reds closed the East-West
Berlin frontier.

Berlin waterways spanned by
some 500 bridges will be the areas
for the exercises.
“Unlike most field training ex
ercises this will be a two-sided
free maneuver,” Brig. Gen. Fred
erick O. Hartel, U.S. Berlin troop
commandant said. “We will allow
commanders maximum freedom
within safety rules and the limita
tions of a somewhat restricted
maneuver area.”

The shooting incident was re
ported by the Dortmund news
paper Westfaelische Rundschau
which said its chief reporter Kurt
Lichtenstein was shot in the stom
ach and then dragged across the
border into the Soviet Zone.

IT SAID Lichtenstein had gone
to the border near the town of
Gifhorn and was talking with an
East German farm laborer when
a Communist policeman opened
fire from 70 yards, hitting him in
the stomach.

Another policeman dashed
across the border road into West
Germany, grabbed the fallen re
porter and dragged him back to
the Communist side.
IN THE BERLIN incident the

10 policemen boldly crossed the
boi’der but retreated when seven
Western policemen and a police
dog rushed to the border area and
demanded they leave.

Allied officials privately ex
pressed satisfaction with West
German handling of the incident
without bloodshed though it was
regarded as one of the most se
rious of a series of incidents since
the Reds closed the East-West
Berlin frontier.
BERLIN (UPD—The U.S. Army I
announced yesterday that 3,000
combat troops will stage extensive
exercises in West Berlin next
week to demonstrate American
firmness in the face of bolder
Communist moves and increasing
East German police incursions.
Communist police shot a West
German reporter in the stomach
and kidnaped him yesterday at
Gifhorn on the West German bor
der. Ton others invaded West Ber
lin early Thursday in search of the
four Communist police who de
fected during the night.
TENSION FEARED last night
at the Friedrichstrasse checkpoint
—the only East Berlin entry point
still open to the Allies. An Ameri
can staff car entered the crossing
point just as a West Beilin loud
speaker opened up. It was feared
for a moment the Communists
would close the border there but
moments later they waved the of
ficial car through.
A crowd of 200 watched the
West Berlin war of nerves ma
neuver.
Shortly after nightfall another
200 West Germans assembled at
the Overbaum Bridge near which
West Berliners recently erected a
wooden cross in memory of two
unknown East Berliners who died
in the Spree Canal while trying to
escape from East Berlin.
THE COMMUNISTS attempted
to frighten the crowd away by
bringing up a water cannon truck.
The crowd became unruly then
and several score voices joined in
the cry of “murderers, murder
ers.” The Communists threw two
or three tear gas grenades and
turned on a searchlight.
West Berlin police arrived at
this point and dispersed the crowd
Without difficulty.
The U.S. Army said 3.000 troops
would take part in the maneuvers
in which one of three crack Ber
lin combat battle groups will play
the role of Communist aggressors
while a second defends the West
ern sectors of the city. The ma
neuvers will be held Oct. 18-20.
