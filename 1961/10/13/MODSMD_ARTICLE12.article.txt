### 
A nurse-midwife aboard the hos
pital ship Hope will speak at the
Public Affairs Discussion in the
Y.W.C.A. lounge at noon today.

Harriet Jordan, a member of
the medical staff of the people-to
people project, will discuss the
reception given this new type of
foreign aid by the people of Indo
nesia and the Far East.

Working in teams with local
medical personnel, members of
the project were often the first
white persons seen by patients.

on teaching local midwives hygi

evaluate the experiences of the
Hope during its year as a floating
hospital.

Miss Jordan received her B.S.

versity of California in Berkeley
and San Francisco and took mid
wifery training in Scotland. In No
vember she will return to her
work with the Frontier Nursing
Service in Hyden, Kentucky.
