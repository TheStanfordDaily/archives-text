## Poll Union's New Rules Approved 
### JEBRRY RANKIN Editor 
Reorganization of Political Un
ion and approval of its first two
caucuses under the new by-laws
were voted last night by Legisla
ture.

LASSU suspended its regular
rules to allow the changes to take
effect today. Under the normal
procedure it would have taken
three weeks for the matter to be
put to a final vote.
After unanimously okaying the
new by-laws, the legislators also
approved, without dissent, the for
mation of the Republican and Con
servative caucuses as the first rec
ognized caucuses within the new
organizational structure.

A SLATE of officers who have
been working unofficially to get
Poll Union underway also was
given the nod.
Main changes between the old
and new by-laws are found in the
caucus setup. Where there were
four—Socialist. Conservative, Re
publican and Democratic—there
are two with others expected to
form.
Under the new rules, a caucus
must have 15 members signed up
instead of 10. Caucuses must keep
their membership lists up to date
and must hold two general busi
ness meetings a quarter and must
present at least two programs a
quarter.
THERE IS no limit on the num
ber of caucuses which may be set
up, as long as they meet the mem
bership qualifications and are ap
proved by the Poli Union execu
tive board and LASSU.

Voting qualifications also are
spelled out clearly in the new set
of rules. A number of minor
changes designed to insure that a
caucus keeps active and reports
to the executive board also were
written in.
In another change, a third vice
president was added to the execu
tive board, an increase of one.
Changes in appointive officers al
so were made, with some being
added and some dropped from the
executive board.
TIIKKK WAS KO opposition to
the new by-laws in the hour dis
cussion.
In other matters, LASSU heard
A1 Shevack propose a student vol
unter group to assist local hos
pitals and the Con Home in vari
ous ways.
He said he would like to estab
lish an office staffed with student
volunteers which would put “a
lot of” Stanford’s “wasted talent
. . . to good use.” He said publicity
