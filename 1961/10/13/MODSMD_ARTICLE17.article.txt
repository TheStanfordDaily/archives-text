# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Spartacus' Is Another Ruined' Great Theme 
### ALAN ROSENTHAL 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Alan Ro

I used to dream of the films I’d
like to make. Unfortunately I’ve
been forced to the conclusion in
recent years that the greater pri
ority is the remaking of a number
of films. These represent cases
where Hollywood has ruined great
themes. “Ten Commandments,”
high in my list of the 10 worst
pictures ever made, springs readi
ly to mind. “A Farewell to Arms,”
and now “Spartacus.”
At least Hollywood is reliable.
Again, with infinite love and
money it has produced one of the
most uninspiring pictures of the
year.

“Spartacus,” at Palo Alto’s
Stanford Theater, had everything
in its favor. A moving theme from
Fast’s novel, and an even better
background from Koestler’s “The
Gladiators.’
THESE BOOKS both had some
thing to say on the concept of
freedom, of the dignity of man
and of the social parallels in our
time. And they had action and
pace. A large part of this spirit
is lost in Dalton Trumbo’s script.

By now, there must be a few
people around who have not read
the story of the doomed gladiatori
al revolt against the Romans. Un
der Stanley Kubrick’s direction
the story starts well.
Till the escape of the gladiators
there is scarcely a foot wrong.
The gladiators’ fight and break is
tensely directed and well edited.
But after that Kubrick, the white
hope of Hollywood, doesn’t miss
a cliche.

KITSCH sunsets, heavenly
choirs, Roman opulence, neatly
run up slave costumes, laughing
children, nude bathing and goat’s
udders in super technirama.
We’ve seen it somewhere before.
Freed slaves grin healthily into
the camera, looking like nothing
so much as Rotarians being inter
viewed at some Los Angeles Hap
py Holiday Camp. As for the
much vaunted love scene it is
easily the deadliest that has been
seen on the screen for some time.
Which takes some doing ! !
A few things work. The pre
battle scenes and the fighting.
Quite exciting if you haven’t seen
Nevsky and don’t mind taking on
massed brass bands in unarmed
combat. On the acting side
Charles Laughton and Ustinov
burble gloriously around as dec
adent Romans, hugely enjoying
the job . . . Whilst Olivier looks as
if he might have believed in the
script at one time, Kirk Douglas
is still a fine hunk of beef but
Tony Curtis as his spiritual blood
brother looks lost without a bow
tie.

TO BE FAIR most people will
enjoy the film. But then our
tastes have been brought so low
by television that we’ve almost
forgotten what constitutes a good
picture. However, anyone who is
at all interested in cinema can
only be bitter at the futility and
waste embodied by the film.
Though the script is fair the di
rection for the most part, is abom
inable and rarely rises above the
obvious. And when will film
makers rediscover that the reali
ties of war are best done in black
and white and not cobalt and
ketchup?

The biggest fault is that having
taken a novel such as “Spartacus”
the producers could have given us
something more than pantomime
and panache. Possibly human dig
nity and truth. In these terms the
Spartacus theme is incredibly
moving and meaningful. Also in
terms of idealism.

THERE is also the genuine won
derment at the nature and inner
conflict of Spartacus the man. Of
this understanding we get hardly
anything except a throw away
scene lauding the simple life
which fails to move us.

At the end of the film Jean Sim
mons lugs at the foot of the cruci-
We feel the same way by that
time. Do the decent thing, old boy,
and let’s clear up and go home,
fied Spartacus. “Die, Spartacus,”
she says. “Die.”
