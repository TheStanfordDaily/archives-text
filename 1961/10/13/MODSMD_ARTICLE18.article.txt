Editor, The Daily;
Unfortunately, I did not see the
Daily issue with Mr. Hermann’s
article. If his thesis was that Com
munists are fomenting difficulties
while posing as protectors of civil
liberties, I can agree that this is
quite likely.
However, the Braden case is a
poor choice for proving this con
tention. I would suggest that Mr.
Hermann and Mr. Cullen—and
anyone else interested in this con
troversy read Anne Braden’s
“The Wall Between.” A copy of
this book is available at the Stan
ford library.
Among other points, Mrs. Brad
en states that she and her hus
band were at one time members
of the Progressive Party, which
did have some avowed Commun
ists as members—as well as a few
Democrats and Republicans.
The raid on the Ford house pro
duced Communist Party pamph
lets which belonged to the owner
of the house, not the white guard
who was in the house at the time
of the bombing.
The Communist literature at
the Braden house consisted of
“Das Kapital” and similar sub
versive material. The Bradens
were never proved Communist
party members.
Mr. Braden’s conviction was ap
pealed and set aside. Mrs. Braden
has not been sued for libel for any
of the statements made in her
book.
But I would recommend this
book primarily as a frightening,
revealing and convincing docu
ment on the problems of segrega
tion and prejudice in this country.
Once again, the Bradens’ purpose
is being lost in a haze of Com
munist (or now also Birchist) ac
cusations.
