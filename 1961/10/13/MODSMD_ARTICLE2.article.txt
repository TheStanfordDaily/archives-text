# SJS Banner on Hoover Tower
## 
### 
Throe San Jose State College
beclsheots were chained to the side
of Hoover Tower about 4 p.m. yes
terday.

Large letters on the sheet-ban
ner proclaimed “S.J.S.” Smaller
letters credited the sign to: “Com
pliments of Molder Hall.”
Hoover Tower guides were
alerted to the banner by two Muir
men who helped remove the ban
ner about five minutes after its
appearance.
They kept the banner, announc
ing it would appear at the game
“in an altered form.”
Guides guessed that the banner
was carried to the tower’s observ
ation platform on a standard tour
by a “short young grad student”
who took a briefcase to the top of
the tower.
