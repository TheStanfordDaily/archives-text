# STAFF OPINION
## 'Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives' 
### BARRY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
I am a “fuzzy-minded” liberal.
I therefore write this column with
trepidation, for I am attempting
to prove that the conservatives,
who consider themselves paragons
of logic, are even more fuzzy
minded than liberals.

Let us start with the concept
that conservatives hold most dear.
Concisely stated, conservatives
believe in the rights t»f American
individuals. Anything which lim
its these rights, such as big gov
ernment or welfare spending, is
anathema.

Stated in three words, conserva
tives “are against compulsion.”
Take social security. William F.
Buckley Jr., the conservatives’
head logician, spends much time
in “Up From Liberalism” com
plaining about the compulsory
nature of social security. People
should be free to decide whether
or not they wish to put money
away for the future.
INCONSISTENCY NO. 1: Con
servatives never complain about
the compulsory draft. According
to their theory, if I do not wish
to waste a couple of years of my
life crawling under barbed wire
with blanks whistling over my
head, I don’t have to report when
I am called.
There is no use arguing that the
national interest must be consid

ered and I therefore must defend
it by learning how to use a rifle.
I can argue that I can better
serve my country by learning how
to use a plow. According to logical
conservatives, as an individual I
have the right to decide whether
I will use a gun or a plow. Only
for some reason logical conserva
tives never say I have that right.
INCONSISTENCY NO. 2: Con
servatives don’t really believe in
the protection of individual rights
for ALL Americans. Only those
who believe in “the American
way.” This, of course, immedi
ately eliminates U.S. citizens who
believe in Marxism-Leninism, for
this philosophy represents the
antithesis of “the American way.”
Conservatives, therefore, sup
port vociferously the House Com
mittee on Un-American Activities,
the scourge of all Communists
and protector of “the American
way.”
It is time to define “the Ameri
can way.” My definition differs
from the conservatives’ definition
and quite possibly your definition
differs from your roommate’s deL
inition. In other words, there are
literally millions of ways of de
fining “the American way,”
AND THIS, ironically, is what
“the American way” is—the right
of every American to define “the
American way” as he sees fit.
Conservatives talk about individu

al rights and yet would shut up
all those people who do not define
‘‘the American way” as they de
fine it.

You may say that conservatives
would deprive only Communists
from defining “the American
way.” This isn’t so. For instance,
the conservatives are opposed to
the fifth amendment. Yet, the
fifth amendment is one of the
greatest safeguards against those
who would deprive you of your
individual rights.
Remember that not only Com
munists “take the fifth.” Many
people who are forced to testify
before committees other than
those looking into Communist in
filtration refuse to testify against
themselves including men in
“Big Business” (and what is more
American than Big Business?)
IF CONSERVATIVES are real
ly interested in individual rights,
why do they wish to abrogate an
amendment which protects these
rights?
American socialists want to na
tionalize many things in this coun
try. According to conservatives,
this is not “the American way.”
Socialists, according to this line of
reasoning, also do not deserve to
have their individual rights pro
tected. Accordingly, they are vili
fied and threatened by upholders
of “the American way.”
Fuzzy-minded liberals? They fa
vor welfare state spending, which,
according to the conservatives, is
un-American. What do conserva
tives do? Liberals are called un-
American. Therefore, liberals’ in
dividual rights do not deserve pro
tection.

SO THERE we are. The main
tenet of conservatives, the protec
tion of individual rights and lib
erties, only applies to a few select
people who see things the same
way as conservatives. All the rest
are vilified. This is more un-
American than most of the prin
ciples or groups the conservatives
attack.

the protection of individual rights
for ALL Americans. Only those
who believe in “the American
way.” This, of course, immedi
ately eliminates U.S. citizens who
believe in Marxism-Leninism, for
this philosophy represents the
antithesis of “the American way.”
Conservatives, therefore, sup
port vociferously the House Com
mittee on Un-American Activities,
the scourge of all Communists
and protector of “the American
way.”
It is time to define “the Ameri
can way.” My definition differs
from the conservatives’ definition
and quite possibly your definition
differs from your roommate’s deL
inition. In other words, there are
literally millions of ways of de
fining “the American way,”
AND THIS, ironically, is what
“the American way” is—the right
of every American to define “the
American way” as he sees fit.
Conservatives talk about individu

al rights and yet would shut up
all those people who do not define
‘‘the American way” as they de
fine it.

You may say that conservatives
would deprive only Communists
from defining “the American
way.” This isn’t so. For instance,
the conservatives are opposed to
the fifth amendment. Yet, the
fifth amendment is one of the
greatest safeguards against those
who would deprive you of your
individual rights.
Remember that not only Com
munists “take the fifth.” Many
people who are forced to testify
before committees other than
those looking into Communist in
filtration refuse to testify against
themselves including men in
“Big Business” (and what is more
American than Big Business?)
IF CONSERVATIVES are real
ly interested in individual rights,
why do they wish to abrogate an
amendment which protects these
rights?
American socialists want to na
tionalize many things in this coun
try. According to conservatives,
this is not “the American way.”
Socialists, according to this line of
reasoning, also do not deserve to
have their individual rights pro
tected. Accordingly, they are vili
fied and threatened by upholders
of “the American way.”
Fuzzy-minded liberals? They fa
vor welfare state spending, which,
according to the conservatives, is
un-American. What do conserva
tives do? Liberals are called un-
American. Therefore, liberals’ in
dividual rights do not deserve pro
tection.

SO THERE we are. The main
tenet of conservatives, the protec
tion of individual rights and lib
erties, only applies to a few select
people who see things the same
way as conservatives. All the rest
are vilified. This is more un-
American than most of the prin
ciples or groups the conservatives
attack.
I am a “fuzzy-minded” liberal.
I therefore write this column with
trepidation, for I am attempting
to prove that the conservatives,
who consider themselves paragons
of logic, are even more fuzzy
minded than liberals.

Let us start with the concept
that conservatives hold most dear.
Concisely stated, conservatives
believe in the rights t»f American
individuals. Anything which lim
its these rights, such as big gov
ernment or welfare spending, is
anathema.

Stated in three words, conserva
tives “are against compulsion.”
Take social security. William F.
Buckley Jr., the conservatives’
head logician, spends much time
in “Up From Liberalism” com
plaining about the compulsory
nature of social security. People
should be free to decide whether
or not they wish to put money
away for the future.
INCONSISTENCY NO. 1: Con
servatives never complain about
the compulsory draft. According
to their theory, if I do not wish
to waste a couple of years of my
life crawling under barbed wire
with blanks whistling over my
head, I don’t have to report when
I am called.
There is no use arguing that the
national interest must be consid

ered and I therefore must defend
it by learning how to use a rifle.
I can argue that I can better
serve my country by learning how
to use a plow. According to logical
conservatives, as an individual I
have the right to decide whether
I will use a gun or a plow. Only
for some reason logical conserva
tives never say I have that right.

amendment which protects these
rights?
American socialists want to na
tionalize many things in this coun
try. According to conservatives,
this is not “the American way.”
Socialists, according to this line of
reasoning, also do not deserve to
have their individual rights pro
tected. Accordingly, they are vili
fied and threatened by upholders
of “the American way.”
Fuzzy-minded liberals? They fa
vor welfare state spending, which,
according to the conservatives, is
un-American. What do conserva
tives do? Liberals are called un-
American. Therefore, liberals’ in
dividual rights do not deserve pro
tection.

SO THERE we are. The main
tenet of conservatives, the protec
tion of individual rights and lib
erties, only applies to a few select
people who see things the same
way as conservatives. All the rest
are vilified. This is more un-
American than most of the prin
ciples or groups the conservatives
attack.
I am a “fuzzy-minded” liberal.
I therefore write this column with
trepidation, for I am attempting
to prove that the conservatives,
who consider themselves paragons
of logic, are even more fuzzy
minded than liberals.

Let us start with the concept
that conservatives hold most dear.
Concisely stated, conservatives
believe in the rights t»f American
individuals. Anything which lim
its these rights, such as big gov
ernment or welfare spending, is
anathema.

Stated in three words, conserva
tives “are against compulsion.”
Take social security. William F.
Buckley Jr., the conservatives’
head logician, spends much time
in “Up From Liberalism” com
plaining about the compulsory
nature of social security. People
should be free to decide whether
or not they wish to put money
away for the future.
INCONSISTENCY NO. 1: Con
servatives never complain about
the compulsory draft. According
to their theory, if I do not wish
to waste a couple of years of my
life crawling under barbed wire
with blanks whistling over my
head, I don’t have to report when
I am called.
There is no use arguing that the
national interest must be consid

ered and I therefore must defend
it by learning how to use a rifle.
I can argue that I can better
serve my country by learning how
to use a plow. According to logical
conservatives, as an individual I
have the right to decide whether
I will use a gun or a plow. Only
for some reason logical conserva
tives never say I have that right.
INCONSISTENCY NO. 2: Con
servatives don’t really believe in
the protection of individual rights
for ALL Americans. Only those
who believe in “the American
way.” This, of course, immedi
ately eliminates U.S. citizens who
believe in Marxism-Leninism, for
this philosophy represents the
antithesis of “the American way.”
Conservatives, therefore, sup
port vociferously the House Com
mittee on Un-American Activities,
the scourge of all Communists
and protector of “the American
way.”
It is time to define “the Ameri
can way.” My definition differs
from the conservatives’ definition
and quite possibly your definition
differs from your roommate’s deL
inition. In other words, there are
literally millions of ways of de
fining “the American way,”
AND THIS, ironically, is what
“the American way” is—the right
of every American to define “the
American way” as he sees fit.
Conservatives talk about individu

al rights and yet would shut up
all those people who do not define
‘‘the American way” as they de
fine it.

You may say that conservatives
would deprive only Communists
from defining “the American
way.” This isn’t so. For instance,
the conservatives are opposed to
the fifth amendment. Yet, the
fifth amendment is one of the
greatest safeguards against those
who would deprive you of your
individual rights.
Remember that not only Com
munists “take the fifth.” Many
people who are forced to testify
before committees other than
those looking into Communist in
filtration refuse to testify against
themselves including men in
“Big Business” (and what is more
American than Big Business?)
IF CONSERVATIVES are real
ly interested in individual rights,
why do they wish to abrogate an
amendment which protects these
rights?
American socialists want to na
tionalize many things in this coun
try. According to conservatives,
this is not “the American way.”
