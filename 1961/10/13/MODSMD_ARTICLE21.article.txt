# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Carry On Constable' 
### DEREK DAVIS 
We have just seen our first
“Carry On” film. If this seems too
incredible to be taken seriously,
please remember that even in the
sixteenth century, some pious
souls went a good 20 years with
out contracting the Black Death.
But lest we paint too dark a pic
ture, “Carry On Constable” (at
the Guild) is an acceptable com
edy. Nothing more. If you are in
one of those morbid moods in
which your chin tends to get
tangled up in your shoelaces, this
is as effective a tonic as any.
Unfortunately, it is a little slow
in taking effect. The first 10 min
utes or so axe noticeably boring,
perhaps because the characters
are not doing what one comes to
expect from the Guinness-Hollo
way-Carmichael-Sim brand of
English comedy, and they are not
doing it in rather poor fashion.
THE INDIVIDUAL comic geni
us, of which the British Isles has
far more than its share, is no
where in evidence here, except,
perhaps, in the role of the Ser
geant.
An unidentified constabulary is
beset by a flu epidemic which
leaves it hopelessly understaffed,
leading to the importing of three
recruits, raw from training, and
one rather effeminate old man.
whose role in the film is poorly
developed.
Naturally, they are four of the
stupidest constables ever to han
dle a billy, or perhaps fatheaded
is a better term. Most of their
glaring errors, indeed, come not
so much from lack of brain power
as from a heightened ability to
make the sort of mistake which is
simple, yet violently embarrassing
(taking a radio mystery as a real
murder).

IF THE situations were a little
less trite and a little less well
telegraphed, they might be more
easily acceptable, especially as
they have the seeds of audience
identification in them.

A remote influence of the Key
stone Cops may be felt, an occa
sional touch of the Three Stooges
is suggested and a generalized
Laurel and Hardy effect (minus
the two most important compon
ents—Laurel and Hardy) comes
more overtly into play, but the
comic porridge still becomes
sticky and cold. The English have
consistently shown themselves
best at original, gentle, subtle hu
mor, and this conscious borrowing
does not fit their standards.

Spoken by a more competent
comic cast, screen writer Norman
Hudis’s lines could easily be
rather effective. He hews more to
the basic English line, but pro
ducer Peter Rogers and director
Gerald Thomas, pulling for the
sort of box-office trade which a
group of uniformed men falling
downstairs will invariably draw,
have embellished the script until
all sense of direction is lost and
the film flits from incident to in
cident in a disjointed scheme.

UNFORTUNATELY, only one
incident in three really works. A
sudden change of pace, in which
the fumbling four suddenly be
come masters of deduction and
capture a band of thieves much
cleverer than themselves, is a bit
hard to take, but here the under
lying gentle English fun comes
through to make it work far bet
ter than it has any right to. Yet
for all its defects, it is still funny
and it is still better than anything
similar which Hollywood might be
unwise enough to attempt.

best at original, gentle, subtle hu

Spoken by a more competent
comic cast, screen writer Norman
Hudis’s lines could easily be
rather effective. He hews more to
the basic English line, but pro
ducer Peter Rogers and director
Gerald Thomas, pulling for the
sort of box-office trade which a
group of uniformed men falling
downstairs will invariably draw,
have embellished the script until
all sense of direction is lost and
the film flits from incident to in
cident in a disjointed scheme.

UNFORTUNATELY, only one
incident in three really works. A
sudden change of pace, in which
the fumbling four suddenly be
come masters of deduction and
capture a band of thieves much
cleverer than themselves, is a bit
hard to take, but here the under
lying gentle English fun comes
through to make it work far bet
ter than it has any right to. Yet
for all its defects, it is still funny
and it is still better than anything
similar which Hollywood might be
unwise enough to attempt.
We have just seen our first
“Carry On” film. If this seems too
incredible to be taken seriously,
please remember that even in the
sixteenth century, some pious
souls went a good 20 years with
out contracting the Black Death.
But lest we paint too dark a pic
ture, “Carry On Constable” (at
the Guild) is an acceptable com
edy. Nothing more. If you are in
one of those morbid moods in

tangled up in your shoelaces, this
is as effective a tonic as any.
Unfortunately, it is a little slow
in taking effect. The first 10 min

perhaps because the characters
are not doing what one comes to
expect from the Guinness-Hollo

English comedy, and they are not
doing it in rather poor fashion.
THE INDIVIDUAL comic geni
us, of which the British Isles has
far more than its share, is no

Naturally, they are four of the

make the sort of mistake which is
simple, yet violently embarrassing

IF THE situations were a little
less trite and a little less well
telegraphed, they might be more

they have the seeds of audience
