Soars will start. Soars has been
working with the first unit all
year but has alternated with
Steve Thurlow regularly.
Sears is tops among Stanford
passers with 16 completions in 32
attempts for a cool .500 batting
average. He has been somewhat
ineffective on the ground with a
net total of -13 yards. Thurlow
will wait in the wings with senior
Chuck Butler and will undoubted
ly be called upon.

The remainder of the starting
lineup—what little there is—will
be intact: George Honore, right
end; C. B. Simons and Frank At
kinson, tackles: Tom Walsh, left
guard; Chris Cottle, center.
SAN JOSE is at full strength
physically and is really up for
what is the highlight of their sea
son. The Sparts boast great back
field speed in Mac Burton, Phil
Clifton and Johnny Johnson.
Their passing game, though not
as effective as the one that beat
the Cards last year, is still a po
tent weapon, particularly in the
short game. Quarterback Chon
Gallegos has thrown for 550
yards, completing them at a .575
rate.
Up front the Spartans are hig,
fast and deep.

The Slanford-San Jose Stale
football game will he broad
east over radio station KCBS
starting at 1:15.
