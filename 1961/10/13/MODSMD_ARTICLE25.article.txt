# Soccermen Face SJS In Opener
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford journeys to San Jose
State tonight to take on the dan
gerous Spartan soccer team.

The game has been played up
in Spartantown via the radio and
television, and several thousand
are expected to be on hand at 8:00
in Spartan Stadium to witness the
opening clash of the Northern
California Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference season.
STANFORD defeated San Jose
State in the conference preseason
tournament 2-1.
The Indians will not be at full
strength. All-conference center
forward Emmanuel Andah will be
hospitalized for minor surgery
and unable to play. Mike Ero sub
stituted capably for Andah in last
Saturday’s practice game with
Hayward United, but the top
scoring threat in the league will
doubtless be missed.

The soccer tilt could end up like
a Roadrunner cartoon with Stan
ford playing the part of the hun
gry coyote. San Jose presents a
front line containing two Olympic
sprinters.
DENNIS Johnson, who runs the
hundred yard dash in 9.3 seconds
with monotonous regularity, will
play as a wing, and Jim Omag
bemi, a 9.4 sprinter from Nigeria
is listed as an inside.

Stanford will present a lineup
containing few surprises. Dan
Farthing, former all-conference
choice, and Rich Lonergan, a first
year varsity man with a world of
potential, will open at the deep
back positions.
Rune Engebrettsen, so far the
steady man of the Indian defense,
Don Burr, and veteran Rusty Wil
liams are slated to go at halfback.
THE front line consists of Mike
Tippett. Albert Nnoli, Ero, Larry
Chukwedebe and Adam Bianchi.
Hunt Bascom is Coach Fred
Priddle’s choice to open at goalie,
but Beau Bianchi or Dave Dier
dorf could move up.
Bascom and Dierdorf have been
first-string goalies for Stanford in
the past and Bianchi has held the
slot since the beginning of last
season, so the Indians are as
sured of having plenty of experi
ence in the lineup, no matter who
is in the game.
