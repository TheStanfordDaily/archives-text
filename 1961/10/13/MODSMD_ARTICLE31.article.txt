# Poloists Schedule Two
## 
### 
Stanford’s varsity water polo
squad will prep for its big game
with Cal tomorrow when it takes
on a fast Foothill College team.
Game time is 3:30 p.m. in the var
sity pool.
Cal, still undefeated, is favored
to take the conference title this
year. The Bears have four starters
back again this year and appear
to be stronger than ever. Stanford
Coach Jim Gaughran isn’t too op
timistic but hopes for an upset.
The Indians have lost only one
man from the 1960 squad and are
faster and deeper than a year ago.
All-AAWU goalie John Bates has
picked up where he left off last
year. Bates sparked the Indians

to their 13-4 win over San Jose
State last week.

The Cards will also have their
leading scorer from last season
back in Bob Lorton. Other letter
men on hand are Mike Conn,
Roger Johnston, Jack Lorton and
Bob Spence.
THE starting lineup will include
Bates at goalie, Spence and Conn
at guards and George Harrison,
Bob and Bill Lorton and Pete Pet
tigrew at forwards.

Following the varsity clash to
day the frosh team will take on
Woodside High School. The year
lings have compiled a 2-0 record,
beating San Jose State frosh and
Fremont High School.
