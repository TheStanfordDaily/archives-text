# Watkins Advocates Closer SU Family
## 
### 
In the first talk of The Breakers
evening series, Dr. James T. Wat
kins IV advocated a closer Stan
ford family, with emphasis on so
cial as well as mental interaction

He presented his view of “Stan
ford’s Ideal Destiny” as the center
of a combination of research, pro
fessional training and liberal edu
cation.
His views for improvement,
specifically in the undergraduate
school included several cardinal
needs.
WATKINS ATTACKED what
he considered unaesthetic sur
roundings, singling out faculty
housing “a high class shanty
town”—and Stern Hall—“concrete
packing boxes.” He suggested that
Lake Lagunita be made perma
nent.
Regarding a more closely knit
Stanford family, Watkins spoke
of a need for better advising, and
for a dean’s office of “complaints,
justice and reform.” He called for
an extension of co-education to
dining. Co-ed dorms are “worth
thinking about,” he said.
HE FAVORED Stanford’s re
maining a residential university
and for extension of the living
group ideas and suggested an in
ter-house council to bo patterned
after the inter-club and inter-fra
ternity councils. He felt that eat
ing clubs should show more initia
tive towards social organization.
Fraternities should be elimi
nated from a “utopian” viewpoint,
he said. More practically, he felt

that they should work towards
the keeping of (heir founding pre
cepts, He advocated rushing dur
ing the freshman year'.
STUDENT PUBLICATIONS
should include an ‘‘organ of stu
dent opinion, more accurate than
the Daily,” and an organ for pub
lishing serious undergraduate
papers. Watkins said.
He stressed treating students as
adults, maintaining that they
know right from wrong. However,
he felt that a “faculty friend”
would be useful in counseling stu
dents in the distinction between
the “wise and the unwise.”

He also asked for more import
ance for- extracurricular activities,
asserting that the purpose of a
university is not “just the train
ing of minds alone,” but the train
ing of minds guided by character.

PROF. JAMES T. WATKINS IV
"Stanford's Ideal Destiny”
In the first talk of The Breakers
evening series, Dr. James T. Wat
kins IV advocated a closer Stan
ford family, with emphasis on so
cial as well as mental interaction

He presented his view of “Stan
ford’s Ideal Destiny” as the center
of a combination of research, pro
fessional training and liberal edu
cation.
His views for improvement,
specifically in the undergraduate
school included several cardinal
needs.
WATKINS ATTACKED what
he considered unaesthetic sur
roundings, singling out faculty
housing “a high class shanty
town”—and Stern Hall—“concrete
packing boxes.” He suggested that
Lake Lagunita be made perma
nent.
Regarding a more closely knit
Stanford family, Watkins spoke
of a need for better advising, and
for a dean’s office of “complaints,
justice and reform.” He called for
an extension of co-education to
dining. Co-ed dorms are “worth
thinking about,” he said.
HE FAVORED Stanford’s re
maining a residential university
and for extension of the living
group ideas and suggested an in
ter-house council to bo patterned
after the inter-club and inter-fra
ternity councils. He felt that eat
