We might as well tell you straight off; Corvair’s the car for the driving enthusiast. Think
that lets you out? Maybe. Maybe not.
Until you’ve driven one, you really can’t say for sure, because Corvair’s kind of driving is
like no other in the land. The amazing air-cooled rear engine sees to that. You swing around
curves flat as you please, in complete control. You whip through the sticky spots other cars
should keep out of in the first place. (Especially this year, now that you can get Positraction
as an extra-cost option.) You stop smoothly, levelly with Corvair’s beautifully balanced,
bigger brakes.
And Corvair’s found other new ways to please you this year. A forced-air heater and
defroster are standard equipment on all coupes, sedans and both Monza and 700 Station
Wagons. So are dual sunshades and front-door armrests and some other goodies. You’ll note
some new styling, inside and out. Nice. And safety-belt installation is easier, too, and cheaper.
Another extra-cost option well worth considering is the heavy-duty front and rear suspension;
it turns a Corvair into a real tiger.
So you can see we haven’t really done much to Corvair this year. Why on earth should we?
If this car, just as she is, can’t make a driving enthusiast out of you, better take a cab.
