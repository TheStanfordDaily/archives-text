# UAW Halts Strikes; Ford Producing Again
## 
### 
DETROIT (UPI) The United
Auto Workers Union Sunday or
dered a virtual end to all strikes
at the Ford Motor Co. The firm
announced it planned to resume
partial production today.
The UAW executive board de
cided in a three-hour meeting to
reopen the giant River Rouge
plant with 30.000 workers, even
though there still were a raft of
unsettled local problems at the
suburban factory.
BUT THE 24-member board al
lowed a Wayne, Mich., assembly
plant with 1,700 workers and a
Cleveland, Ohio, stamping plant
with 3,200 to remain on strike.
The board acted after an inten
sive week-end drive produced
agreements at 12 plants around
the country, leaving only the
Rouge, Wayne and Cleveland
plants unsettled out of 85 Ford
plants.
A master national contract was
ratified last week and the union
ordered an official end to the
nationwide strike which idled 120,-
000 workers Oct. 3. But the union
said plants without local contracts
could remain on strike, pending
yesterday’s meeting.
IN MOVING to reopen the
Rouge plant, the board said “sub
stantial progress” had been made
in resolving disputes at seven bar
gaining units and hence “there
could be no further justification
for continuing the strike” at the
world’s largest manufacturing
complex.
In allowing the Cleveland work
ers to remain on strike, the board
said “the only matters still at is
sue are several company de
mands” to cancel out agreements
dating back to 1955.
If the Cleveland strike is not
settled soon, it could tie up Ford
production in short order, just as

the firm begins producing cars for
tile first time in two weeks. The
plant is the only source of some
body stampings for all Ford, Fal
con and Comet cars, and a short
strike there last year quickly shut
16 other plants.
FORI) PLANS to begin produc
ing cars again today. It is recall
ing 40,000 workers and will re
open 25 plants. Another 6,000
workers at four more plants will
return Tuesday. They will join 2,-
000 workers at 22 parts depots
which reopened Friday.
Local settlements reached yes
terday included a Mahwah. N.J.,
assembly plant, another at St.
Louis which went on strike July
26, two engine plants in Cleveland
and another in Lima, Ohio, a foun
dry in Cleveland and a spark plug
plant in Fostoria, Ohio,
The first cars are expected to
roll off an assembly line at Me
tuchen, N.J., or Norfolk, Va., two
of nine assembly plants reopening
with a full crew.
A SPOKESMAN said "at least”
50.000 workers were being recalled
today but most will be in non-as
sembly operations.
Ford last night recalled 2,000
steel workers at the Rouge plant
where blast furnaces have been
banked for two weeks. Steel pro
duction isn’t expected to resume
for a day or so, however.
THE COMPANY also recalled
2,200 Rouge tool and die men and
5.000 Rouge stamping plant work
ers.
The stamping plant, like the
tool and die unit, still hadn’t
reached agreement on local prob
lems.
The executive board of the
UAW also reviewed the status of
Chrysler negotiations but did not
authorize a strike against the na
tion's number three auto maker.

The UAW executive board de
cided in a three-hour meeting to
reopen the giant River Rouge
plant with 30.000 workers, even
though there still were a raft of
