College pranks turned into van
dalism early Friday morning as a
band of San Jose students raided
Stanford’s campus and left their
mark for all to see.
The vandalism took the form
of an estimated $l5OO worth of
damages to the Stanford Stadium
caused by nine San Jose students,
plus attempted reprisals on the
part of Stanfordites for both the
defacement of the Stadium and
the hanging of an “SJS” banner
on Hoover Tower.
FOUR SAN JOSE men were
apprehended by Stanford police
making their rounds at 4 a.m.
Friday. The others fled but were
picked up by Palo Alto police as
they came off the campus. All of
the students wore taken back to
the Stadium and an assessment
of damages was made.
It was found that the letters
“SJS” had been burned into the
turf in four places Seven cans of
lye and five cans of gasoline—all
empty were found in the trunk
of the first car, and it is surmised
that these had been used for the
job.
In addition, gold paint had been
splashed on the scoreboard, and
the goal posts had been almost
sawed through.
AS REPORTED in Friday’s
Daily, a banner made of three
bedsheets was fastened to the
side of Hoover Tower about 4
p.m. on Thursday. The banner,
draped from the observation plat
form, proclaimed “S.J.S.—Compli
ments of Molder Hall.” It was re
moved shortly after it was put
up.
In return for these acts
Stanfordites entered the Stadium
on Friday night and sprinkled a
green powder on the green-paint
ed benches which the Spartan
troops would occupy. It was
thought that the powder would
turn the tan football pants to
purple.
THE STANFORDITES also
rigged up hoses with sprinkler
outlets beneath the benches of
the San Jose rooting section.
However, Stadium authorities dis
covered both of these malfunc
tions in the morning and were
able to clean the benches and re
move the hoses before the game.
The nine SJS students were
remanded to the custody of the
Dean of Students at San Jose
State, but their student body
cards were held by the Stanford
Police Department. Chief Gordon
Davis indicated that the Stanford
police may charge the malefac
tors with arson and vandalism if
no action is taken by the SJS
administration.

AS REPORTED in Friday’s
Daily, a banner made of three
bedsheets was fastened to the
side of Hoover Tower about 4
p.m. on Thursday. The banner,
draped from the observation plat
form, proclaimed “S.J.S.—Compli
ments of Molder Hall.” It was re
moved shortly after it was put
up.
In return for these acts
Stanfordites entered the Stadium
on Friday night and sprinkled a
green powder on the green-paint
ed benches which the Spartan
troops would occupy. It was
thought that the powder would
turn the tan football pants to
purple.
THE STANFORDITES also
rigged up hoses with sprinkler
outlets beneath the benches of
the San Jose rooting section.
However, Stadium authorities dis
covered both of these malfunc
tions in the morning and were
able to clean the benches and re
move the hoses before the game.
The nine SJS students were
remanded to the custody of the
Dean of Students at San Jose
State, but their student body
cards were held by the Stanford
Police Department. Chief Gordon
Davis indicated that the Stanford
police may charge the malefac
tors with arson and vandalism if
no action is taken by the SJS
administration.
College pranks turned into van
dalism early Friday morning as a
band of San Jose students raided
Stanford’s campus and left their
mark for all to see.
The vandalism took the form
of an estimated $l5OO worth of
damages to the Stanford Stadium
caused by nine San Jose students,
plus attempted reprisals on the
part of Stanfordites for both the
defacement of the Stadium and
the hanging of an “SJS” banner
on Hoover Tower.
FOUR SAN JOSE men were
apprehended by Stanford police
making their rounds at 4 a.m.
Friday. The others fled but were
picked up by Palo Alto police as
they came off the campus. All of
the students wore taken back to
the Stadium and an assessment
of damages was made.
It was found that the letters
“SJS” had been burned into the
turf in four places Seven cans of
lye and five cans of gasoline—all
empty were found in the trunk
of the first car, and it is surmised
that these had been used for the
job.
In addition, gold paint had been
splashed on the scoreboard, and
the goal posts had been almost
sawed through.
