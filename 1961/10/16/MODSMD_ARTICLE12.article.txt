# Not a Particularly Profitable Debate
## 
### 
Most of tlie overflow crowd which jammed Cubberley Friday
afternoon to hear the discussion on the John Birch Society would
agree that little, if anything, was accomplished.
Mr. Rousselot said nothing new or revealing about the Birch
Society and did not answer directly any of the questions put to him.
The panelists (partly through lack of time) did not particularly
distinguish themselves, either.

The moderator did not use his voice or microphone to the neces
sary degree to maintain order. The organizers of the event made a
mistake in scheduling the discussion for Cubberley when it must
have been obvious that it would be filled to capacity—and more.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was not occupied at that time and would
have been a much wiser choice.

And, finally, the audience was in one of the worst moods we
have ever seen the usual hissing, booing Stanford crowds in.
The crowd was discourteous to everyone on the stage, especially
to Mr. Rousselot, and to some of those who asked questions from
the floor. Thus it deprived itself of time which might have been
better spent in listening to the speaker.

We can only hope that next time a program on a touchy subject
is scheduled, it will he held in a large enough auditorium, enough

time for all will be alloted, the moderator will moderate and the
audience will open its ears and close its mouth while guests of the
University are speaking.
