# Walter Lippmann Sen. Fulbright's Future
## 
### 
Sen. Fulbright has now begun
to run for re-election, and all the
signs indicate that over and above
the local issues in Arkansas, the
campaign will be of great interest
to the nation as a whole. For an
important part of the opposition
to the Senator comes from outside
of Arkansas.
It comes from radical right ex
tremists like Sen. Goldwater
among the Republicans and Sen.
Thurmond among the Democrats.
It is highly significant and very
interesting indeed that they have
chosen to do battle not with a man
of the left, but with as genuine a
conservative in the great tradition
of conservatism as exists in our
public life today.
Thus the Arkansas senatorial
campaign will bring a confronta
tion between traditional American
conservatism and a wholly new
phenomenon, a radical reaction
sai ing under the flag of conserva
tism. This reactionary radicalism
has as little relation to conserva
tism as the so-called peoples’
democracies beyond the Iron Cur
tain have to democracy.
THE TRUE conservatives of
whom the greatest in (his century
is Churchill, are indissolubly at
one with the constitutional
sources of the nation’s life. For
' cm he nation is a living thing
h'ch grows and changes, and
toy think of themselves as par
ticipating in this growth and
change. Because they themselves
are so secure and certain about
what is essential and fundamental,
the more intelligent conservatives
are liberal in temper and progres
sive in policy.
Son. Fullbrlght is that kind of
conservative, and so he is standing
challenge to the reactionary radi
c Is who are in revolt against all
the main developments of the
twentieth century.
They are against the conse
quences of modern science and
technology which have brought
into being a concentration of
masses of people in cities, masses
of people uprooted from their an
cestral ways of life. These radical
reactionaries are against the wel
fare state which provides these
urban masses with some of that
personal security which their an
cestors in the country made in
their communities.
AND THEY are against the reg
ulation of this enormously com
plex economy, though without
regulation it would churn itself
up into crisis and chaos.
The reactionary radicals, who
would like to repeal the twentieth
century, are, so they tell us, vio
lently opposed to Communism.
But Communism also belongs to
the twentieth century and these
reactionary radicals do not under
stand it and do not know how to
resist it.
Thus they do not want the alli
ance with which we have con

tained Communism in Europe at
the armistice lines of World War
11. They are against foreign aid
which is used to help new coun
tries and weak countries help
themselves without succumbing to
Communism. They despise the
United Nations which has so much
to do in opening up for the new
and inexperienced countries the
roads to freedom.
THEY DO believe loyally in
American military power. But
they do not understand it. They do
not understand that the United
States, though very strong, is not
omnipotent, and that we cannot
set the world in order and achieve
total victory over Communism by
issuing ultimata.
Their responsibility in foreign
affairs is such that if the Presi
dent did for the country what
they say he ought to be doing,
there would be going on at one
and the same time another Korean
War in Southeast Asia, a some
what smaller Algerian war in
Cuba, and a thermo-nuclear war
about Berlin.
Sen. Fulbright, with the authori
ty and with the intimate knowl
edge that come to him as chair
man of the Foreign Relations
Committee of the Senate, has
stoori f irmly against such irre
•■"c i.' Ip r v e'lfe. The nation i
greatly in his debt. The role he
plays in Washington is an indis
pen-sible role. There is no one else
who is so powerful and also so
wise, and if there were any ques
tion oi removing him from public
life, it would be a national calam
ity-
NOT ONLY has he been the
bravest and wisest of advisers. He
is also the most far-seeing and
constructive. It has been said of
him all too often that he has been
right too soon. That is a great
compliment. In our democracy
somebody who is listened to must
be right before it is popular to be
right.
Here Sen. Fulbright has a dis
tinguished record which goes back
to the Second World War when,
still an unknown and unnoticed
Congressman from Arkansas, he
brought out the Fulbright resolu
tion which led the change of
American opinion against isola
tion.
He was, I think, the first Ameri
can public man who realized that
if Western Europe was to co-exist
with the Soviet Union, it would
have to unite. And he is the first
responsible American statesman
to be saying that the necessary
counterweight to the development
of the Communist power is a
much closer political and economic
integration of the Western World.
The decision must be made by
the voters of Arkansas. But what
is at stake is important to the
whole nation.

tism. This reactionary radicalism
has as little relation to conserva
tism as the so-called peoples’
democracies beyond the Iron Cur
tain have to democracy.
THE TRUE conservatives of
whom the greatest in (his century
is Churchill, are indissolubly at
one with the constitutional
sources of the nation’s life. For
' cm he nation is a living thing
h'ch grows and changes, and
toy think of themselves as par
ticipating in this growth and
change. Because they themselves
are so secure and certain about
what is essential and fundamental,
the more intelligent conservatives
are liberal in temper and progres
sive in policy.
Son. Fullbrlght is that kind of
conservative, and so he is standing
challenge to the reactionary radi
c Is who are in revolt against all
the main developments of the
twentieth century.
They are against the conse
quences of modern science and
technology which have brought
into being a concentration of
masses of people in cities, masses
of people uprooted from their an
cestral ways of life. These radical
reactionaries are against the wel
fare state which provides these
urban masses with some of that
personal security which their an
cestors in the country made in
their communities.
AND THEY are against the reg
ulation of this enormously com
plex economy, though without
regulation it would churn itself
up into crisis and chaos.
The reactionary radicals, who
would like to repeal the twentieth
century, are, so they tell us, vio
lently opposed to Communism.
But Communism also belongs to
the twentieth century and these
reactionary radicals do not under
stand it and do not know how to
resist it.
Thus they do not want the alli
ance with which we have con

tained Communism in Europe at
the armistice lines of World War
11. They are against foreign aid
which is used to help new coun
tries and weak countries help
themselves without succumbing to
Communism. They despise the
United Nations which has so much
to do in opening up for the new
and inexperienced countries the
roads to freedom.
THEY DO believe loyally in
American military power. But
they do not understand it. They do
not understand that the United
States, though very strong, is not
omnipotent, and that we cannot
set the world in order and achieve
total victory over Communism by
issuing ultimata.
Their responsibility in foreign
affairs is such that if the Presi
dent did for the country what
they say he ought to be doing,
there would be going on at one
and the same time another Korean
War in Southeast Asia, a some
what smaller Algerian war in
Cuba, and a thermo-nuclear war
about Berlin.
Sen. Fulbright, with the authori
ty and with the intimate knowl
edge that come to him as chair
man of the Foreign Relations
Committee of the Senate, has
stoori f irmly against such irre
•■"c i.' Ip r v e'lfe. The nation i
greatly in his debt. The role he
plays in Washington is an indis
pen-sible role. There is no one else
who is so powerful and also so
wise, and if there were any ques
tion oi removing him from public
life, it would be a national calam
ity-
NOT ONLY has he been the
bravest and wisest of advisers. He
is also the most far-seeing and
constructive. It has been said of
him all too often that he has been
right too soon. That is a great
compliment. In our democracy
somebody who is listened to must
be right before it is popular to be
right.
Here Sen. Fulbright has a dis
tinguished record which goes back
to the Second World War when,
still an unknown and unnoticed
Congressman from Arkansas, he
brought out the Fulbright resolu
tion which led the change of
American opinion against isola
tion.
He was, I think, the first Ameri
can public man who realized that
if Western Europe was to co-exist
with the Soviet Union, it would
have to unite. And he is the first
responsible American statesman
to be saying that the necessary
counterweight to the development
of the Communist power is a
much closer political and economic
integration of the Western World.
The decision must be made by
the voters of Arkansas. But what
is at stake is important to the
whole nation.

Sen. Fulbright has now begun
to run for re-election, and all the
signs indicate that over and above
the local issues in Arkansas, the
campaign will be of great interest
to the nation as a whole. For an
important part of the opposition
to the Senator comes from outside
of Arkansas.
It comes from radical right ex
tremists like Sen. Goldwater
among the Republicans and Sen.
Thurmond among the Democrats.
It is highly significant and very
interesting indeed that they have
chosen to do battle not with a man
of the left, but with as genuine a
conservative in the great tradition
of conservatism as exists in our
public life today.
Thus the Arkansas senatorial
campaign will bring a confronta
tion between traditional American
conservatism and a wholly new
phenomenon, a radical reaction
sai ing under the flag of conserva
tism. This reactionary radicalism
has as little relation to conserva
tism as the so-called peoples’
democracies beyond the Iron Cur

They are against the conse
quences of modern science and
technology which have brought
into being a concentration of
masses of people in cities, masses
of people uprooted from their an
cestral ways of life. These radical
reactionaries are against the wel
fare state which provides these
urban masses with some of that
personal security which their an
cestors in the country made in
their communities.
AND THEY are against the reg
ulation of this enormously com
plex economy, though without
regulation it would churn itself
up into crisis and chaos.
The reactionary radicals, who
would like to repeal the twentieth
century, are, so they tell us, vio
lently opposed to Communism.
But Communism also belongs to
the twentieth century and these
reactionary radicals do not under
stand it and do not know how to
resist it.
Thus they do not want the alli
ance with which we have con

tained Communism in Europe at
the armistice lines of World War
11. They are against foreign aid
which is used to help new coun
tries and weak countries help
themselves without succumbing to
Communism. They despise the
United Nations which has so much
to do in opening up for the new
and inexperienced countries the
roads to freedom.
THEY DO believe loyally in
American military power. But
they do not understand it. They do
not understand that the United
States, though very strong, is not
omnipotent, and that we cannot
set the world in order and achieve
total victory over Communism by
issuing ultimata.
Their responsibility in foreign
affairs is such that if the Presi
dent did for the country what
they say he ought to be doing,
there would be going on at one
and the same time another Korean
War in Southeast Asia, a some
what smaller Algerian war in
Cuba, and a thermo-nuclear war
about Berlin.
Sen. Fulbright, with the authori
ty and with the intimate knowl
edge that come to him as chair
man of the Foreign Relations
Committee of the Senate, has
stoori f irmly against such irre
•■"c i.' Ip r v e'lfe. The nation i
greatly in his debt. The role he
plays in Washington is an indis
pen-sible role. There is no one else
who is so powerful and also so
wise, and if there were any ques
tion oi removing him from public
life, it would be a national calam
ity-
NOT ONLY has he been the
bravest and wisest of advisers. He
is also the most far-seeing and
constructive. It has been said of
him all too often that he has been
right too soon. That is a great
compliment. In our democracy
somebody who is listened to must
be right before it is popular to be
right.
Here Sen. Fulbright has a dis
tinguished record which goes back
to the Second World War when,
still an unknown and unnoticed
Congressman from Arkansas, he
brought out the Fulbright resolu
tion which led the change of
American opinion against isola
tion.
He was, I think, the first Ameri
can public man who realized that
if Western Europe was to co-exist
with the Soviet Union, it would
have to unite. And he is the first
responsible American statesman
to be saying that the necessary
counterweight to the development
of the Communist power is a
much closer political and economic
integration of the Western World.
The decision must be made by
the voters of Arkansas. But what
is at stake is important to the
whole nation.

Sen. Fulbright has now begun
to run for re-election, and all the
signs indicate that over and above
the local issues in Arkansas, the
campaign will be of great interest
to the nation as a whole. For an
important part of the opposition
to the Senator comes from outside
of Arkansas.
It comes from radical right ex
tremists like Sen. Goldwater
among the Republicans and Sen.
Thurmond among the Democrats.
It is highly significant and very
interesting indeed that they have
chosen to do battle not with a man
of the left, but with as genuine a
conservative in the great tradition
of conservatism as exists in our
public life today.
Thus the Arkansas senatorial
campaign will bring a confronta
tion between traditional American
conservatism and a wholly new
phenomenon, a radical reaction
sai ing under the flag of conserva
tism. This reactionary radicalism
has as little relation to conserva
tism as the so-called peoples’
democracies beyond the Iron Cur
tain have to democracy.
THE TRUE conservatives of
whom the greatest in (his century
is Churchill, are indissolubly at
one with the constitutional
sources of the nation’s life. For
' cm he nation is a living thing
h'ch grows and changes, and
toy think of themselves as par
ticipating in this growth and
change. Because they themselves
are so secure and certain about
what is essential and fundamental,
the more intelligent conservatives
are liberal in temper and progres
sive in policy.
Son. Fullbrlght is that kind of
conservative, and so he is standing
challenge to the reactionary radi
c Is who are in revolt against all
the main developments of the
twentieth century.

quences of modern science and
