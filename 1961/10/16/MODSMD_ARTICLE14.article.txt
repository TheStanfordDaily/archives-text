Having lived in a Communist
country for eigtit years does not
make me, or anyone else, an au
thority on the subject of com
munism. Yet I definitely have my
feelings about it based upon my
personal experiences.
Listening to (he debate on the
Birch Society, however, I some
how could not cor relate the things
I know and feel about communism
with the words of the speaker,
who professes to know a great
deal about it.

Frankly, his views scared me,
because a man or group which
cries “attack, attack’’ but in fact
is constantly on the defense, can
be dangerous indeed.
THE MILITANCY and activism
of this group should not mislead
us. Behind the facade of this mili
tancy there is fear, naked human
fear- nothing else - which reveals
not strength hut weakness and a
lack of self-confidence.

Is not this fear, though, justi
fieri in the face of Mr. Khrush
chev’s threats?

There is no doubt in my mind
that the Communists do every
thing in their power to achieve
their ends by all possible means,
but does this mean that all our
actions, ideas, plans should now
be dependent on what they—the
Communists—act, think or plan?

ACCORDING to a very simple
minded and superficial logic, thks
should be so. If they advocate
something we should oppose it, if
they are against an idea we should
be for it, although things could
get complicated.
For instance sometimes they
advocate what they really oppose
and oppose what they are really
for, and it takes a keen mind to
find out how we should steer our
own ideas and actions on this
basis.

This would take a great deal of
mental effort, and it seems to me
that the Birchers try to avoid that
by keeping themselves and other
people out from the range of any
idea of association which would
bear the implication of one being
duped or exploited by the Com
munists.
THIS CAN be achieved, how
ever, only if one stays completely
static in any matter concerning
progress, and fights any change
of the status quo. Let me bo spe
cific.
In the Union of South Africa
the progressive elements of that
country fight against apartheid.
So do the Communists.
Maybe they are sincere about
it, or maybe it is only part of their
strategy. In any case what should
the others do? Should they aban
don their cause for human justice
and human rights just because
Communists are, or pi-etend to be,
along with them?
DO NOT causes and principles
like integration, civil liberties and
social justice have their own abso
lute merit regardless of a certain
portion of supporters who might
very well be insincere about these
concepts?
Do ( we always have to look
round for subversive Commun
' ks before raising our voices for a
aune which we sincerely believe
n?
“Characteristic liberal naivete,
naivete which ignores the Com
munist threat”—would any of my
conservative friends cut me off
with that statement?
I WOULD find exactly in this
critical remark of theirs the mani
festation of tragic shortsighted
ness. If you are a chess player, a
bad one I mean, then you never
hink ahead, your steps are only
ho immediate responses to your
opponent’s moves.
But If you want to win the game
then you work in accordance with
an idea, not inflexible to be sure,
but constructive for your purposes
and therefore indirectly destruc
tive to your opponent.
A Bircher in the South would
shy away from fighting for inte
gration since he could and pos
sibly would be labeled by some as
a Communist agent.
A TRUE anti-Communist liber
al would fight for integration be
cause it is right and also because
by wiping out this particular trou
ble spot we would deprive the
Communists of one of their major
propaganda weapons.
In Denmark or in Holland or in
England, the Communist parties
would love to overthrow the gov
ernments. But nobody seems to be
particularly worried, because the
peoples of these countries are
prosperous and content, and the
Communists have lost their ap
peal to the masses, if they ever
had any.
How did this come about? Not
through the machinations of semi
secret societies or committees, but
through the dedicated work of a
long line of progressive individu
als and governments, which in the
case of England for instance, have

lifted that country from (he Eng
land of Dickens to the England of
Churchill and Attlee.

THEY HAVE done their job
without watching nervously
whether the Communists were
supporting or fighting them, and
the net result is a negligible one
or two per cent vote for the Com
munist party at nat ional elections,
and very slight prospects for any
subversion in an atmosphere of
total hostility towards them.
This, and only Ibis, dynamic and
progressive process in Western
European countries can account
for the fact that these countries
are much farther from commun
ism—even if their railways are
nationalized than any of the
shaky South American republics
where we can expect Cuban-type
revolutions at any lime.
But don’t we have in the United
States, too, a progressive tradition
and prosperity? Yes we do. and
therefore Communism has as lit
tle chance hero as in Western Eu
rope. What is the explanation then
for the existence and advance of
the Birch Society?
WE, as opposed to the Western
European countries, are only on

the way toward a welfare state,
and the society fights against just
'that. The real targets are not the
Communists, infinitesimal in num
ber and in influence, but the
“dupes” of Communism, who in
England would simply be called
laborites or even pink conserva
tives.

If we live in a nice suburban
neighborhood we usually are not
afraid of burglars, we do not
constantly lock our doors and do
not place a machinegun on the
roof.

WK ARE enlightened enough to
know that burglars are the prod
ucts of the slums. Of course, we
can lie on our stomachs on the
roof, grabbing the gun with our
trembling hands, anxiously wait
ing for the burglars expected to
descend on us from the slums.

They are only a few, they might
not even come, but since we are
nervous and feel like shooting,
we shoot at shadows which we
think are theirs.

Of course, we do not really hurt
them hut we make our own and
fellow men’s lives miserable.
Would it not be much more sensi
ble to clear our slums instead?
