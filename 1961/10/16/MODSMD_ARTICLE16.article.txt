Editor, The Daily:
Where I worked ... this .. .
summer, the procedure for handl
ing questions from the floor fol
lowing a public debate or speech
. . . was this:
Any member of the audience
who wished to question the speak
er .. . simply wrote down his
question on a piece of paper,
folded it, and passed it to his
right, where it would be collected
and brought up to the podium at
the end of the speech . . .
The moderator of the program
would then sort the collection and
hand each piece of paper to the
proper speaker, who answered the
questions one by one after first
reading them aloud.
The benefits of such a system
were obvious. No member of the
audience could turn his “question”
into a long, rambling, incoherent
and inaudible diatribe directed not
so much at the speaker as at the
other members of the audience.
The question would have to be |
kept fairly short or. if long, would
have to be prepared in advance,
and would thus stand a better
chance of being organized and
well thought out.
Also, the speakei would be
forced to deal with that particular
issue stated in black and white in
front of him, and could not escape
floing so as speakers often can
when faced with the typical;
“question from the floor” which,
by its lengthy and generally over
stated nature, often leaves the
speaker' with convenient “loop
holes.”
If . . . Friday’s speech by and
panel debate with Congressman
Rousselot showed nothing else, it
. . . showed that it’s about lime
Stanford began to give serious
thought to inaugurating some
thing similar to the above . . .
question-handling method.
For the Rousselot debate, no
matter from which side . . you
viewed it, was an all too unfor
tunate and , . . all too frequent
example of probably the worst
way possible to handle questions
from the floor and answers from
the stage.
Dick Teschner Jr.
Editor, The Daily:
Is there any truth to the rumor
going around the campus that the
name of this “paper” is about to
be changed to The Stanford Daily
Worker? Or should we give cre
dence to the story that it will
merely be printed on pink paper in
the future?
The above has been byway of
introduction to my major indict
ment of the political climate that,
I have seen evidenced by certain
factions on this campus.
While attending Congressman
Rousselot’s speech on Friday, I
witnessed one of the most disgust
ing performances which I have
ever seen in my six years of col
lege at five different institutions
both here and abroad.
I was shocked and outraged by
the actions, attitude and words of
Prof. John Bunzel of the political
science department.
There was absolutely no excuse
for the way he conducted himself
with regard to Congressman
Rousselot and the audience in
general.
With examples like him, we can
indeed charge many liberals with
being fuzzy thinkers and make it
stick. As is the usual technique of
the left, when Mr. Bunzel could
not add anything constructive to
the conversation, he resorted to
the old liberal trick of making
fun of his opposition, primarily
by making wildly hypothetical
generalizations.
As ho apparently did not have
anything worth saying he devoted
almost his entire time to the at
tempted ridicule of some imagin
ary body which he passed off as
the John Birch Society.
But I challenge even his most
sincere and staunch defender , . .
to justify his cheap and shabby
debating tactic of derision aimed
at an improbable straw man which
he tried to identify as his foe.
And yet the audience roared
with laughter when he talked and I
wildly applauded afterwards. It is j
indeed a sad commentary on those
present that so many were evi-1
dently laughing with him and his 1
kind and not at them.

Editor, The Daily :
Concerning Mr. Krass’ letter
upon an objective course in Com
munism:
We are appalled at ids narrow
minded outlook. Mr, Krass seems
to consider “objective,” in looking
at the communistic system, as
everything Bad from our point of
view, and in looking at the Ameri
can free enterprise system, as
everything Good.
Mr. Krass we tear, does not
seem to know the basic difference
between the terms “subjective”
and “objective” for they appear
to be one in his mind. “Subjec
tive,” for the philosophic point
of view, implies bias or that which
belongs to or proceeds from the
thinking subject, and “objective,”
that which is in nature, that which
is perceived, and remains free

from the biased view of the per
ceiving mind.
Mr. Krass' conception of treat
ing issues as black and white
could post a great danger to seri
ous and earnest intellectual en
deavor. lie defeats his own pur
pose and that of an objective
course by coloring his views in
this manner.
We suggest a serious reconsid
eration on the part of Mr. Krass!

Trembling with excitement. 1
endorse the program of Mr. Krass.
I deem it the height of folly lead
ing assuredly to the depths of na
tional degradation- for the na
tion for California, not to employ
its democratic machinery in ap
praising our children upon
whom the new darkness will, if
there he not eternal vigilance,
descend with black and heavy fi
nality of “the insidious ways in
which the communists indoctri
nate their youth.”
It is my impassioned hope
nay, my present prayer that
others will join with Mr. Krass
and me in dedicated application to
the institution of means to this
proposed goal in education.

Editor, The Daily:
In the last few issues of The
Daily the topic of your editorials
has been the Communist Party of
the U.S.A. I thought it might do
you and your staff (and any lansi
some good to read what the Com
munist theoreticians have to say
about the civil liberties question.
The following quotations are
taken from “Strategy and Tactics
of the Proletarian Revolution,”
International Publishers, Now
York, from the series of volumes
"Readings in Leninism” written by
V. Bystryansky and M. Mishin. As
its preface it states;
“This material should be ex
tremely helpful as a guide to in
dividual or group study of the fun
damental principles of Leninism.”
The quotations are:
(Page 55) “To a revolutionary,
the main thing is revolutionary
work and not reforms. To him re
forms are by-products of the revo
lution. Therefore, with revolution

ary tactics under the existing
hour; eoisie regime, reforms in
evitably serve as instruments that
disintegrate the regime.
“The revolutionary will accept
a reform in order to use it as a
means wherewith to link legal
wurk with illegal work, in order
to use it as a screen behind which
his illegal activities for the revo
lutionary preparation of the
masses for the overthrow of the
bourgoisie may be intensified.
“Beginning with the most ele
oentary movements of protest
■-uind the urgent needs of the
toilers, the communists must use
fli xible tactics to draw ever wider
masses into the movement. As the
movement gains in width and
depth, the slogans of the struggle
must be changed, while preparing
to vna-.h the fascist bourgeoisie
dicta un ship with the aid of the
vet y i/msses that are in the fascist
organization.”
To me ii would seem that the
Con munist is directed to exploit
our fight to defend our civil lib
erties, not help.

Hurray for our team! I see by
s I)ail> that lids week
the t S. Army will he conducting
e-season intra-squad war. 1
withered from the article that as
yet no date has been set for
Army’s much heralded opener
it h I lie highly rated Russian
Bears.
Sports observers feel that the
opposing athletic commissions
will not schedule the meeting until
their respective schools have com
pleted the harvest.
Now i have not followed Army

very closely in past seasons, hut
it seems to me that, while both
sides have excellent recruiting
programs and thus a lot of squad
depth and also considerable popu
lar' support, from their fans Army
is crippled by a lack of level-head
ed quarterbacks.
However, Coach Fred Hartel is
confident that his team has im
proved, and this week’s drill
should provide valuable experi
ence for some of his sophomores.
Win or lose, though, (he Army-
Bear contest should provide plen
ty of action for spectators. With
each campus staking its athletic
reputation on the outcome of this
clash, surely neither team will
concede defeat until the final gun
has sounded.
Undoubtedly, the fans will gel
their money’s worth and leave the I
stadium exhausted from having
witnessed an exceptionally hard
fought battle.
Yes, it should be an interesting
game.

Lditor, The Daily:
One cannot help but notice the
attempts at mind-reading that go
on daily in The Daily. Take Barry
Greenberg’s art i c 1 e entitled, j
“Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives’’ as I
a case in point.
The following are quotations j
from his article:
1. “Anything which limits these [
(individual) rights, such as big
government, or welfare spending,
is anathema.’’
2. “Stated in three words, Con

i servativcs are against compul
sion.”
j 3. “According to logical Con
servatives, as an individual I have
the right to decide whether I will
use a gun or a plow.”
4. “Conservatives don’t really
believe in the protection of individ
ual rights for ALL Americans.”
5. “Conservatives, therefore,
support vociferously the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities.”
(i. “Conservatives are opposed
to the fifth amendment.”
7. “So there we are. The main
tenet of Conservatives, the protec
tion of individual rights and lib
erties, applies only to a few select
people who see things the same
way as Conservatives.”
By whose definition are the
foregoing statements the tenets
of Conservatism? They are cer

tainly not the definitions given by
Conservatives. Are they then the
work of one Barry Greenberg?
As Barry defined it in his own
words, ‘The American way is
the right of every American to
define ‘the American way’ as he
secs fit.”
If this were true, would it not

make more sense to let each in
dividual Conservative and Liber
al alike express his own beliefs?
Mr. Greenberg has already
demonstrated his inability to ex
press Conservative viewpoints.
Perhaps he could do better on the
Liberal side.

By whose definition are the

tainly not the definitions given by
Conservatives. Are they then the
work of one Barry Greenberg?
As Barry defined it in his own

If this were true, would it not

Mr. Greenberg has already
demonstrated his inability to ex

Perhaps he could do better on the
Liberal side.

Editor, The Daily:
Where I worked ... this .. .
summer, the procedure for handl
ing questions from the floor fol
lowing a public debate or speech
. . . was this:
Any member of the audience
who wished to question the speak
er .. . simply wrote down his
question on a piece of paper,
folded it, and passed it to his
right, where it would be collected
and brought up to the podium at
the end of the speech . . .
The moderator of the program
would then sort the collection and
hand each piece of paper to the
proper speaker, who answered the
questions one by one after first
reading them aloud.
The benefits of such a system
were obvious. No member of the
audience could turn his “question”
into a long, rambling, incoherent
and inaudible diatribe directed not
so much at the speaker as at the
other members of the audience.
The question would have to be |
kept fairly short or. if long, would
have to be prepared in advance,
and would thus stand a better
chance of being organized and
well thought out.
Also, the speakei would be
forced to deal with that particular
issue stated in black and white in
front of him, and could not escape
floing so as speakers often can
when faced with the typical;
“question from the floor” which,
by its lengthy and generally over
stated nature, often leaves the
speaker' with convenient “loop
holes.”
If . . . Friday’s speech by and
panel debate with Congressman
Rousselot showed nothing else, it
. . . showed that it’s about lime
Stanford began to give serious
thought to inaugurating some
thing similar to the above . . .
question-handling method.
For the Rousselot debate, no
matter from which side . . you
viewed it, was an all too unfor
tunate and , . . all too frequent
example of probably the worst
way possible to handle questions
from the floor and answers from
the stage.
Dick Teschner Jr.
Editor, The Daily:
Is there any truth to the rumor
going around the campus that the
name of this “paper” is about to
be changed to The Stanford Daily
Worker? Or should we give cre
dence to the story that it will
merely be printed on pink paper in
the future?
The above has been byway of
introduction to my major indict
ment of the political climate that,
I have seen evidenced by certain
factions on this campus.
While attending Congressman
Rousselot’s speech on Friday, I
witnessed one of the most disgust
ing performances which I have
ever seen in my six years of col
lege at five different institutions
both here and abroad.
I was shocked and outraged by
the actions, attitude and words of
Prof. John Bunzel of the political
science department.
There was absolutely no excuse
for the way he conducted himself
with regard to Congressman
Rousselot and the audience in
general.
With examples like him, we can
indeed charge many liberals with
being fuzzy thinkers and make it
stick. As is the usual technique of
the left, when Mr. Bunzel could
not add anything constructive to
the conversation, he resorted to
the old liberal trick of making
fun of his opposition, primarily
by making wildly hypothetical
generalizations.
As ho apparently did not have
anything worth saying he devoted
almost his entire time to the at
tempted ridicule of some imagin
ary body which he passed off as
the John Birch Society.
But I challenge even his most
sincere and staunch defender , . .
to justify his cheap and shabby
debating tactic of derision aimed
at an improbable straw man which
he tried to identify as his foe.
And yet the audience roared
with laughter when he talked and I
wildly applauded afterwards. It is j
indeed a sad commentary on those
present that so many were evi-1
dently laughing with him and his 1
kind and not at them.

Concerning Mr. Krass’ letter
upon an objective course in Com
munism:
We are appalled at ids narrow
minded outlook. Mr, Krass seems
to consider “objective,” in looking
at the communistic system, as
everything Bad from our point of
view, and in looking at the Ameri
can free enterprise system, as
everything Good.
Mr. Krass we tear, does not
seem to know the basic difference
between the terms “subjective”
and “objective” for they appear
to be one in his mind. “Subjec
tive,” for the philosophic point
of view, implies bias or that which
belongs to or proceeds from the
thinking subject, and “objective,”
that which is in nature, that which
is perceived, and remains free

from the biased view of the per
ceiving mind.
Mr. Krass' conception of treat
ing issues as black and white
could post a great danger to seri
ous and earnest intellectual en
deavor. lie defeats his own pur
pose and that of an objective
course by coloring his views in
this manner.
We suggest a serious reconsid
eration on the part of Mr. Krass!

In the last few issues of The

has been the Communist Party of
the U.S.A. I thought it might do
you and your staff (and any lansi
some good to read what the Com
munist theoreticians have to say
about the civil liberties question.
The following quotations are
taken from “Strategy and Tactics
of the Proletarian Revolution,”
International Publishers, Now
York, from the series of volumes
"Readings in Leninism” written by
V. Bystryansky and M. Mishin. As
its preface it states;
“This material should be ex
tremely helpful as a guide to in
dividual or group study of the fun
damental principles of Leninism.”
The quotations are:
(Page 55) “To a revolutionary,
the main thing is revolutionary
work and not reforms. To him re
forms are by-products of the revo
lution. Therefore, with revolution

ary tactics under the existing
hour; eoisie regime, reforms in
evitably serve as instruments that
disintegrate the regime.
“The revolutionary will accept
a reform in order to use it as a
means wherewith to link legal
wurk with illegal work, in order
to use it as a screen behind which
his illegal activities for the revo
lutionary preparation of the
masses for the overthrow of the
bourgoisie may be intensified.
“Beginning with the most ele
oentary movements of protest
■-uind the urgent needs of the
toilers, the communists must use
fli xible tactics to draw ever wider
masses into the movement. As the
movement gains in width and
depth, the slogans of the struggle
must be changed, while preparing
to vna-.h the fascist bourgeoisie
dicta un ship with the aid of the
vet y i/msses that are in the fascist
organization.”
To me ii would seem that the
Con munist is directed to exploit
our fight to defend our civil lib
erties, not help.

Win or lose, though, (he Army-

One cannot help but notice the
attempts at mind-reading that go
on daily in The Daily. Take Barry
Greenberg’s art i c 1 e entitled, j
“Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives’’ as I
a case in point.
The following are quotations j
from his article:
1. “Anything which limits these [
(individual) rights, such as big
government, or welfare spending,
is anathema.’’
2. “Stated in three words, Con

i servativcs are against compul
sion.”
j 3. “According to logical Con
servatives, as an individual I have
the right to decide whether I will
use a gun or a plow.”
4. “Conservatives don’t really
believe in the protection of individ
ual rights for ALL Americans.”
5. “Conservatives, therefore,
support vociferously the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities.”
(i. “Conservatives are opposed
to the fifth amendment.”
7. “So there we are. The main
tenet of Conservatives, the protec
tion of individual rights and lib
erties, applies only to a few select
people who see things the same
way as Conservatives.”
By whose definition are the
foregoing statements the tenets
of Conservatism? They are cer

tainly not the definitions given by
Conservatives. Are they then the
work of one Barry Greenberg?
As Barry defined it in his own
words, ‘The American way is
the right of every American to
define ‘the American way’ as he
secs fit.”
If this were true, would it not

make more sense to let each in
dividual Conservative and Liber
al alike express his own beliefs?
Mr. Greenberg has already
demonstrated his inability to ex
press Conservative viewpoints.
Perhaps he could do better on the
Liberal side.

Editor, The Daily:
Where I worked ... this .. .
summer, the procedure for handl
ing questions from the floor fol
lowing a public debate or speech
. . . was this:
Any member of the audience
who wished to question the speak
er .. . simply wrote down his
question on a piece of paper,
folded it, and passed it to his
right, where it would be collected
and brought up to the podium at
the end of the speech . . .
The moderator of the program
would then sort the collection and
hand each piece of paper to the
proper speaker, who answered the
questions one by one after first
reading them aloud.
The benefits of such a system
were obvious. No member of the
audience could turn his “question”
into a long, rambling, incoherent
and inaudible diatribe directed not
so much at the speaker as at the
other members of the audience.
The question would have to be |
kept fairly short or. if long, would
have to be prepared in advance,
and would thus stand a better
chance of being organized and
well thought out.
Also, the speakei would be
forced to deal with that particular
issue stated in black and white in
front of him, and could not escape
floing so as speakers often can
when faced with the typical;
“question from the floor” which,
by its lengthy and generally over
stated nature, often leaves the
speaker' with convenient “loop
holes.”
If . . . Friday’s speech by and
panel debate with Congressman
Rousselot showed nothing else, it
. . . showed that it’s about lime
Stanford began to give serious
thought to inaugurating some
thing similar to the above . . .
question-handling method.
For the Rousselot debate, no
matter from which side . . you
viewed it, was an all too unfor
tunate and , . . all too frequent
example of probably the worst
way possible to handle questions
from the floor and answers from
the stage.
Dick Teschner Jr.
Editor, The Daily:
Is there any truth to the rumor
going around the campus that the
name of this “paper” is about to
be changed to The Stanford Daily
Worker? Or should we give cre
dence to the story that it will
merely be printed on pink paper in
the future?
The above has been byway of
introduction to my major indict
ment of the political climate that,
I have seen evidenced by certain
factions on this campus.
While attending Congressman
Rousselot’s speech on Friday, I
witnessed one of the most disgust
ing performances which I have
ever seen in my six years of col
lege at five different institutions
both here and abroad.
I was shocked and outraged by
the actions, attitude and words of
Prof. John Bunzel of the political
science department.
There was absolutely no excuse
for the way he conducted himself
with regard to Congressman
Rousselot and the audience in
general.
With examples like him, we can
indeed charge many liberals with
being fuzzy thinkers and make it
stick. As is the usual technique of
the left, when Mr. Bunzel could
not add anything constructive to
the conversation, he resorted to
the old liberal trick of making
fun of his opposition, primarily
by making wildly hypothetical
generalizations.
As ho apparently did not have
anything worth saying he devoted
almost his entire time to the at
tempted ridicule of some imagin
ary body which he passed off as
the John Birch Society.
But I challenge even his most
sincere and staunch defender , . .
to justify his cheap and shabby
debating tactic of derision aimed
at an improbable straw man which
he tried to identify as his foe.
And yet the audience roared
with laughter when he talked and I
wildly applauded afterwards. It is j
indeed a sad commentary on those
present that so many were evi-1
dently laughing with him and his 1
kind and not at them.

Concerning Mr. Krass’ letter
upon an objective course in Com
munism:
We are appalled at ids narrow
minded outlook. Mr, Krass seems
to consider “objective,” in looking
at the communistic system, as
everything Bad from our point of
view, and in looking at the Ameri
can free enterprise system, as
everything Good.
Mr. Krass we tear, does not
seem to know the basic difference
between the terms “subjective”
and “objective” for they appear
to be one in his mind. “Subjec
tive,” for the philosophic point
of view, implies bias or that which
belongs to or proceeds from the
thinking subject, and “objective,”
that which is in nature, that which
is perceived, and remains free

from the biased view of the per
ceiving mind.
Mr. Krass' conception of treat
ing issues as black and white
could post a great danger to seri
ous and earnest intellectual en
deavor. lie defeats his own pur
pose and that of an objective
course by coloring his views in
this manner.
We suggest a serious reconsid
eration on the part of Mr. Krass!

In the last few issues of The

has been the Communist Party of

you and your staff (and any lansi

about the civil liberties question.
The following quotations are
taken from “Strategy and Tactics
of the Proletarian Revolution,”
International Publishers, Now

"Readings in Leninism” written by
V. Bystryansky and M. Mishin. As
its preface it states;
“This material should be ex
tremely helpful as a guide to in
dividual or group study of the fun
damental principles of Leninism.”
The quotations are:
(Page 55) “To a revolutionary,
the main thing is revolutionary
work and not reforms. To him re
forms are by-products of the revo
lution. Therefore, with revolution

ary tactics under the existing
hour; eoisie regime, reforms in
evitably serve as instruments that
disintegrate the regime.
“The revolutionary will accept
a reform in order to use it as a
means wherewith to link legal
wurk with illegal work, in order
to use it as a screen behind which
his illegal activities for the revo
lutionary preparation of the
masses for the overthrow of the
bourgoisie may be intensified.
“Beginning with the most ele
oentary movements of protest
■-uind the urgent needs of the
toilers, the communists must use
fli xible tactics to draw ever wider
masses into the movement. As the
movement gains in width and
depth, the slogans of the struggle
must be changed, while preparing
to vna-.h the fascist bourgeoisie

One cannot help but notice the
attempts at mind-reading that go

Greenberg’s art i c 1 e entitled, j
“Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives’’ as I
a case in point.
The following are quotations j
from his article:
1. “Anything which limits these [
(individual) rights, such as big
government, or welfare spending,
is anathema.’’
2. “Stated in three words, Con

i servativcs are against compul
sion.”
j 3. “According to logical Con
servatives, as an individual I have
the right to decide whether I will
use a gun or a plow.”
4. “Conservatives don’t really
believe in the protection of individ
ual rights for ALL Americans.”
5. “Conservatives, therefore,
support vociferously the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities.”
(i. “Conservatives are opposed
to the fifth amendment.”
7. “So there we are. The main
tenet of Conservatives, the protec
tion of individual rights and lib
erties, applies only to a few select
people who see things the same
way as Conservatives.”
By whose definition are the
foregoing statements the tenets
of Conservatism? They are cer

tainly not the definitions given by
Conservatives. Are they then the
work of one Barry Greenberg?
As Barry defined it in his own
words, ‘The American way is
the right of every American to
define ‘the American way’ as he
secs fit.”
If this were true, would it not

make more sense to let each in
dividual Conservative and Liber
al alike express his own beliefs?
Mr. Greenberg has already
demonstrated his inability to ex
press Conservative viewpoints.
Perhaps he could do better on the
Liberal side.

Editor, The Daily:
Where I worked ... this .. .
summer, the procedure for handl
ing questions from the floor fol
lowing a public debate or speech
. . . was this:
Any member of the audience
who wished to question the speak
er .. . simply wrote down his
question on a piece of paper,
folded it, and passed it to his
right, where it would be collected
and brought up to the podium at
the end of the speech . . .
The moderator of the program
would then sort the collection and
hand each piece of paper to the
proper speaker, who answered the
questions one by one after first
reading them aloud.
The benefits of such a system
were obvious. No member of the
audience could turn his “question”
into a long, rambling, incoherent
and inaudible diatribe directed not
so much at the speaker as at the
other members of the audience.
The question would have to be |
kept fairly short or. if long, would
have to be prepared in advance,
and would thus stand a better
chance of being organized and
well thought out.
Also, the speakei would be
forced to deal with that particular
issue stated in black and white in
front of him, and could not escape
floing so as speakers often can
when faced with the typical;
“question from the floor” which,
by its lengthy and generally over
stated nature, often leaves the
speaker' with convenient “loop
holes.”
If . . . Friday’s speech by and
panel debate with Congressman
Rousselot showed nothing else, it
. . . showed that it’s about lime
Stanford began to give serious
thought to inaugurating some
thing similar to the above . . .
question-handling method.
For the Rousselot debate, no
matter from which side . . you
viewed it, was an all too unfor
tunate and , . . all too frequent
example of probably the worst
way possible to handle questions
from the floor and answers from
the stage.
Dick Teschner Jr.
Editor, The Daily:
Is there any truth to the rumor
going around the campus that the
name of this “paper” is about to
be changed to The Stanford Daily
Worker? Or should we give cre
dence to the story that it will
merely be printed on pink paper in
the future?
The above has been byway of
introduction to my major indict
ment of the political climate that,
I have seen evidenced by certain
factions on this campus.
While attending Congressman
Rousselot’s speech on Friday, I
witnessed one of the most disgust
ing performances which I have
ever seen in my six years of col
lege at five different institutions
both here and abroad.
I was shocked and outraged by
the actions, attitude and words of
Prof. John Bunzel of the political
science department.
There was absolutely no excuse
for the way he conducted himself
with regard to Congressman
Rousselot and the audience in
general.
With examples like him, we can
indeed charge many liberals with
being fuzzy thinkers and make it
stick. As is the usual technique of
the left, when Mr. Bunzel could
not add anything constructive to
the conversation, he resorted to
the old liberal trick of making
fun of his opposition, primarily
by making wildly hypothetical
generalizations.
As ho apparently did not have
anything worth saying he devoted
almost his entire time to the at
tempted ridicule of some imagin
ary body which he passed off as
the John Birch Society.
But I challenge even his most
sincere and staunch defender , . .
to justify his cheap and shabby
debating tactic of derision aimed
at an improbable straw man which
he tried to identify as his foe.
And yet the audience roared
with laughter when he talked and I
wildly applauded afterwards. It is j
indeed a sad commentary on those
present that so many were evi-1
dently laughing with him and his 1
kind and not at them.

Concerning Mr. Krass’ letter
upon an objective course in Com
munism:
We are appalled at ids narrow
minded outlook. Mr, Krass seems
to consider “objective,” in looking
at the communistic system, as
everything Bad from our point of
view, and in looking at the Ameri
can free enterprise system, as
everything Good.
Mr. Krass we tear, does not
seem to know the basic difference
between the terms “subjective”
and “objective” for they appear
to be one in his mind. “Subjec
tive,” for the philosophic point
of view, implies bias or that which
belongs to or proceeds from the
thinking subject, and “objective,”
that which is in nature, that which
is perceived, and remains free

from the biased view of the per
ceiving mind.
Mr. Krass' conception of treat
ing issues as black and white
could post a great danger to seri
ous and earnest intellectual en
deavor. lie defeats his own pur
pose and that of an objective
course by coloring his views in
this manner.
We suggest a serious reconsid

In the last few issues of The
Daily the topic of your editorials
has been the Communist Party of
the U.S.A. I thought it might do
you and your staff (and any lansi
some good to read what the Com
munist theoreticians have to say
about the civil liberties question.
The following quotations are
taken from “Strategy and Tactics
of the Proletarian Revolution,”
International Publishers, Now
York, from the series of volumes
"Readings in Leninism” written by
V. Bystryansky and M. Mishin. As
its preface it states;
“This material should be ex
tremely helpful as a guide to in
dividual or group study of the fun
damental principles of Leninism.”
The quotations are:
(Page 55) “To a revolutionary,
the main thing is revolutionary
work and not reforms. To him re
forms are by-products of the revo
lution. Therefore, with revolution

ary tactics under the existing
hour; eoisie regime, reforms in
evitably serve as instruments that
disintegrate the regime.
“The revolutionary will accept
a reform in order to use it as a
means wherewith to link legal
wurk with illegal work, in order
to use it as a screen behind which
his illegal activities for the revo
lutionary preparation of the
masses for the overthrow of the
bourgoisie may be intensified.
“Beginning with the most ele
oentary movements of protest
■-uind the urgent needs of the
toilers, the communists must use
fli xible tactics to draw ever wider
masses into the movement. As the
movement gains in width and
depth, the slogans of the struggle
must be changed, while preparing
to vna-.h the fascist bourgeoisie
dicta un ship with the aid of the
vet y i/msses that are in the fascist
organization.”
To me ii would seem that the
Con munist is directed to exploit
our fight to defend our civil lib
erties, not help.

One cannot help but notice the
attempts at mind-reading that go
on daily in The Daily. Take Barry
Greenberg’s art i c 1 e entitled, j
“Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives’’ as I
a case in point.
The following are quotations j
from his article:
1. “Anything which limits these [
(individual) rights, such as big
government, or welfare spending,
is anathema.’’
2. “Stated in three words, Con

i servativcs are against compul
sion.”
j 3. “According to logical Con
servatives, as an individual I have
the right to decide whether I will
use a gun or a plow.”
4. “Conservatives don’t really
believe in the protection of individ
ual rights for ALL Americans.”
5. “Conservatives, therefore,
support vociferously the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities.”
(i. “Conservatives are opposed
to the fifth amendment.”
7. “So there we are. The main
tenet of Conservatives, the protec
tion of individual rights and lib
erties, applies only to a few select
people who see things the same
way as Conservatives.”
By whose definition are the
foregoing statements the tenets
of Conservatism? They are cer

tainly not the definitions given by
Conservatives. Are they then the
work of one Barry Greenberg?
As Barry defined it in his own
words, ‘The American way is
the right of every American to
define ‘the American way’ as he
secs fit.”
If this were true, would it not

make more sense to let each in
dividual Conservative and Liber
al alike express his own beliefs?
Mr. Greenberg has already
demonstrated his inability to ex
press Conservative viewpoints.
Perhaps he could do better on the
Liberal side.
IJ. s. lOliason
Editor, The Daily:
Where I worked ... this .. .
summer, the procedure for handl
ing questions from the floor fol
lowing a public debate or speech
. . . was this:
Any member of the audience
who wished to question the speak
er .. . simply wrote down his
question on a piece of paper,
folded it, and passed it to his
right, where it would be collected
and brought up to the podium at
the end of the speech . . .
The moderator of the program
would then sort the collection and
hand each piece of paper to the
proper speaker, who answered the
questions one by one after first
reading them aloud.
The benefits of such a system
were obvious. No member of the
audience could turn his “question”
into a long, rambling, incoherent
and inaudible diatribe directed not
so much at the speaker as at the
other members of the audience.
The question would have to be |
kept fairly short or. if long, would
have to be prepared in advance,
and would thus stand a better
chance of being organized and
well thought out.
Also, the speakei would be
forced to deal with that particular
issue stated in black and white in
front of him, and could not escape
floing so as speakers often can
when faced with the typical;
“question from the floor” which,
by its lengthy and generally over
stated nature, often leaves the
speaker' with convenient “loop
holes.”
If . . . Friday’s speech by and
panel debate with Congressman
Rousselot showed nothing else, it
. . . showed that it’s about lime
Stanford began to give serious
thought to inaugurating some
thing similar to the above . . .
question-handling method.
For the Rousselot debate, no
matter from which side . . you
viewed it, was an all too unfor
tunate and , . . all too frequent
example of probably the worst
way possible to handle questions
from the floor and answers from
the stage.
Dick Teschner Jr.
Editor, The Daily:
Is there any truth to the rumor
going around the campus that the
name of this “paper” is about to
be changed to The Stanford Daily
Worker? Or should we give cre
dence to the story that it will
merely be printed on pink paper in
the future?
The above has been byway of
introduction to my major indict
ment of the political climate that,
I have seen evidenced by certain
factions on this campus.
While attending Congressman
Rousselot’s speech on Friday, I
witnessed one of the most disgust
ing performances which I have
ever seen in my six years of col
lege at five different institutions
both here and abroad.
I was shocked and outraged by
the actions, attitude and words of
Prof. John Bunzel of the political
science department.
There was absolutely no excuse
for the way he conducted himself
with regard to Congressman
Rousselot and the audience in
general.
With examples like him, we can
indeed charge many liberals with
being fuzzy thinkers and make it
stick. As is the usual technique of
the left, when Mr. Bunzel could
not add anything constructive to
the conversation, he resorted to
the old liberal trick of making
fun of his opposition, primarily
by making wildly hypothetical
generalizations.
As ho apparently did not have
anything worth saying he devoted
almost his entire time to the at
tempted ridicule of some imagin
ary body which he passed off as
the John Birch Society.
But I challenge even his most
sincere and staunch defender , . .
to justify his cheap and shabby
debating tactic of derision aimed
at an improbable straw man which
he tried to identify as his foe.
And yet the audience roared
with laughter when he talked and I
wildly applauded afterwards. It is j
indeed a sad commentary on those
present that so many were evi-1
dently laughing with him and his 1
kind and not at them.
Paul B. Van Boren
Editor, The Daily :
Concerning Mr. Krass’ letter
upon an objective course in Com
munism:
We are appalled at ids narrow
minded outlook. Mr, Krass seems
to consider “objective,” in looking
at the communistic system, as
everything Bad from our point of
view, and in looking at the Ameri
can free enterprise system, as
everything Good.
Mr. Krass we tear, does not
seem to know the basic difference
between the terms “subjective”
and “objective” for they appear
to be one in his mind. “Subjec
tive,” for the philosophic point
of view, implies bias or that which
belongs to or proceeds from the
thinking subject, and “objective,”
that which is in nature, that which
is perceived, and remains free

from the biased view of the per
ceiving mind.
Mr. Krass' conception of treat
ing issues as black and white
could post a great danger to seri
ous and earnest intellectual en
deavor. lie defeats his own pur
pose and that of an objective
course by coloring his views in
this manner.
We suggest a serious reconsid
eration on the part of Mr. Krass!

Mr. Krass we tear, does not

that which is in nature, that which

Mr. Krass' conception of treat

In the last few issues of The
Daily the topic of your editorials
has been the Communist Party of
the U.S.A. I thought it might do
you and your staff (and any lansi
some good to read what the Com
munist theoreticians have to say
about the civil liberties question.
The following quotations are
taken from “Strategy and Tactics
of the Proletarian Revolution,”
International Publishers, Now
York, from the series of volumes
"Readings in Leninism” written by
V. Bystryansky and M. Mishin. As
its preface it states;
“This material should be ex
tremely helpful as a guide to in
dividual or group study of the fun
damental principles of Leninism.”
The quotations are:
(Page 55) “To a revolutionary,
the main thing is revolutionary
work and not reforms. To him re
forms are by-products of the revo
lution. Therefore, with revolution

ary tactics under the existing
hour; eoisie regime, reforms in
evitably serve as instruments that
disintegrate the regime.
“The revolutionary will accept
a reform in order to use it as a
means wherewith to link legal
wurk with illegal work, in order
to use it as a screen behind which
his illegal activities for the revo
lutionary preparation of the
masses for the overthrow of the
bourgoisie may be intensified.
“Beginning with the most ele
oentary movements of protest
■-uind the urgent needs of the
toilers, the communists must use
fli xible tactics to draw ever wider
masses into the movement. As the
movement gains in width and
depth, the slogans of the struggle
must be changed, while preparing
to vna-.h the fascist bourgeoisie
dicta un ship with the aid of the
vet y i/msses that are in the fascist
organization.”
To me ii would seem that the
Con munist is directed to exploit
our fight to defend our civil lib
erties, not help.

One cannot help but notice the
attempts at mind-reading that go
on daily in The Daily. Take Barry
Greenberg’s art i c 1 e entitled, j
“Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives’’ as I
a case in point.
The following are quotations j
from his article:
1. “Anything which limits these [
(individual) rights, such as big
government, or welfare spending,
is anathema.’’
2. “Stated in three words, Con

i servativcs are against compul
sion.”
j 3. “According to logical Con
servatives, as an individual I have
the right to decide whether I will
use a gun or a plow.”
4. “Conservatives don’t really
believe in the protection of individ
ual rights for ALL Americans.”
5. “Conservatives, therefore,
support vociferously the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities.”
(i. “Conservatives are opposed
to the fifth amendment.”
7. “So there we are. The main
tenet of Conservatives, the protec
tion of individual rights and lib
erties, applies only to a few select
people who see things the same
way as Conservatives.”
By whose definition are the
foregoing statements the tenets
of Conservatism? They are cer

tainly not the definitions given by
Conservatives. Are they then the
work of one Barry Greenberg?
As Barry defined it in his own
words, ‘The American way is
the right of every American to
define ‘the American way’ as he
secs fit.”
If this were true, would it not

make more sense to let each in
dividual Conservative and Liber
al alike express his own beliefs?
Mr. Greenberg has already
demonstrated his inability to ex
press Conservative viewpoints.
Perhaps he could do better on the
Liberal side.
IJ. s. lOliason
Editor, The Daily:
Where I worked ... this .. .
summer, the procedure for handl
ing questions from the floor fol
lowing a public debate or speech
. . . was this:
Any member of the audience
who wished to question the speak
er .. . simply wrote down his
question on a piece of paper,
folded it, and passed it to his
right, where it would be collected
and brought up to the podium at
the end of the speech . . .
The moderator of the program
would then sort the collection and
hand each piece of paper to the
proper speaker, who answered the
questions one by one after first
reading them aloud.
The benefits of such a system
were obvious. No member of the
audience could turn his “question”
into a long, rambling, incoherent
and inaudible diatribe directed not
so much at the speaker as at the
other members of the audience.
The question would have to be |
kept fairly short or. if long, would
have to be prepared in advance,
and would thus stand a better
chance of being organized and
well thought out.
Also, the speakei would be
forced to deal with that particular
issue stated in black and white in
front of him, and could not escape
floing so as speakers often can
when faced with the typical;
“question from the floor” which,
by its lengthy and generally over
stated nature, often leaves the
speaker' with convenient “loop
holes.”
If . . . Friday’s speech by and
panel debate with Congressman
Rousselot showed nothing else, it
. . . showed that it’s about lime
Stanford began to give serious
thought to inaugurating some
thing similar to the above . . .
question-handling method.
For the Rousselot debate, no
matter from which side . . you
viewed it, was an all too unfor
tunate and , . . all too frequent
example of probably the worst
way possible to handle questions
from the floor and answers from
the stage.
Dick Teschner Jr.
Editor, The Daily:
Is there any truth to the rumor
going around the campus that the
name of this “paper” is about to
be changed to The Stanford Daily
Worker? Or should we give cre
dence to the story that it will
merely be printed on pink paper in
the future?
The above has been byway of
introduction to my major indict
ment of the political climate that,
I have seen evidenced by certain
factions on this campus.
While attending Congressman
Rousselot’s speech on Friday, I
witnessed one of the most disgust
ing performances which I have
ever seen in my six years of col
lege at five different institutions
both here and abroad.
I was shocked and outraged by
the actions, attitude and words of
Prof. John Bunzel of the political
science department.
There was absolutely no excuse
for the way he conducted himself
with regard to Congressman
Rousselot and the audience in
general.
With examples like him, we can
indeed charge many liberals with
being fuzzy thinkers and make it
stick. As is the usual technique of
the left, when Mr. Bunzel could
not add anything constructive to
the conversation, he resorted to
the old liberal trick of making
fun of his opposition, primarily
by making wildly hypothetical
generalizations.
As ho apparently did not have
anything worth saying he devoted
almost his entire time to the at
tempted ridicule of some imagin
ary body which he passed off as
the John Birch Society.
But I challenge even his most
sincere and staunch defender , . .
to justify his cheap and shabby
debating tactic of derision aimed
at an improbable straw man which
he tried to identify as his foe.
And yet the audience roared
with laughter when he talked and I
wildly applauded afterwards. It is j
indeed a sad commentary on those
present that so many were evi-1
dently laughing with him and his 1
kind and not at them.
