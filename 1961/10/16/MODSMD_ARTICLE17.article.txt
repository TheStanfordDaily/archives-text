# Frosh Gridders Lose To Trobabes, 13-12
## 
### 
Stanford freshman gridders
dropped their first game of the
season to USC frosh 13-12 Satur
day in 104-degree Los Angeles
weather.
After a scoreless first half for
the Papooses, Bob Ruth play

ing defensive line-backer, inter
cepted a USC pass and .scampered
better than fifty yards for the
first Stanford touchdown. The
conversion attempt failed as USC
blocked a Stanford boot. The other
TD was scored by quarterback
Dick Berg on a sneak through the
middle. The run for the conversion
was stopped less than six inches
from the USC goal.
A good deal of fumbling in both
halves ruined Stanford’s chances
for scoring more than once inside
USC’s 15-yard line.
Coach Stavely thought the line
was much stronger than he had
expected, but was disappointed in
his halfbacks who “just weren’t
running.”
He thought that Bob Rath and
Frank Bunch, his two fullbacks,
ran very well and (hat the entire
team looked good on defense. Not
singling out any one person on the
line, Stavely lauded the entire for
ward wall for its performance.
To point out the heat, 200 people
suffered heat prostration at the
UCLA-Vanderbilt played just a
few miles away in the Coliseum.
