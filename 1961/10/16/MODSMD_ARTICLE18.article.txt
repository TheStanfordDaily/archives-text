# Spartan Coach Picks Thurlow Most Damaging
## 
### PETE KING 
“Our best game yet,”’ was the
comment of San Jose State coach
Boh Titchenal, after his Spartans
had just lost, 17-6, to a rugged
Stanford eleven. “All the boys
did a fine job. Stanford played top
defense; that team will be tough.”
Titchenal remarked that San
Jose should have taken advantage
of its breaks. He said, “I felt that
we could go, but we weren't con
sistent in moving the ball.”
All three San Jose units played
in the game. Titchenal stated that
both injuries and the 85-degree
heat forced the use of reserves.
The San Jose coach had high
praise for the Stanford team as a
whole: “They’re a real fine ball
club. Stanford will be even better
when they get some experience.”
He singled out Indian quarterback
Steve Thurlow as the man damag
ing San Jose the most. “He killed
us with that option play,” Titch
enal remarked.
