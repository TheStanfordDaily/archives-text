# Indians Dump SJS
## Thurlow Leads Fumbling Cards To Third Win 
### ROY SCHMIDT Sports Editor 
Sophomore quarterback Steve
Thurlow held together a crippled,
fumbling Stanford football team
and led them to a IT-6 win over
San Jose Saturday.
The 199-pound young ste r
passed for one touchdown and
set up another with his near-per
fect running of the option. He
accounted for 109 yards total, 75
coming on the ground.
THE INDIANS, missing four
regulars, still managed to out
class the Spartans in all depart
ments but pa s s i n g. The score
could easily have been more lop
sided, but for two Stanford
fumbles within two yards of pay
dirt and still anpthcr on their
own eight which set up the Spar
tan score
Stanford, playing the same de
termined defense that carried
them to two wins in their first
three outings, contained San
Jose’s speedy hacks, holding tiiem
to 98 yards for the game. The
secondary could not seem to stop
the aerials of Chon Gallegos, who
was the nation’s leading passer
going into the game. Gallegos
threw for 161 yards, completing
12 of 20.
The Indians started fast with
Frank Patitucci falling on a San
Jose fumble on the enemy 36.
Twelve plays later the Indians
were on the one where quarter
back Rod Sears fumbled and
Hank Chammess recovered for
State.

THE NEXT time the Indians
got the ball they were not to be
denied. With Thurlow at the con
trols they marched 82 yards in
11 plays, Tony DeLollis punch
ing over from the two. Big play
in the drive was a 44-yard end
sweep by Danny Spence which
moved the ball deep into San
Jose territory. That run, inciden
tally, was the longest from scrim
mage this year for the Indians.
Stan Lindskog left-footed it
through for the extra point.
The Indians stayed well in com
mand as the second quarter

opened. The Spartans had yet to
penetrate the Stanford 30. Then
after Larry Doss’s punt put the
Indians deep in their own terri
tory, Sears again fumbled and
San Jose’s Leon Donahue recov
ered on the eight.

It took Gallegos just three
plays to convert it, pitching out
to Tom Doslak for the six points.
A pass for the extra point went
awry and Stanford led 7-6.
BOTH TEAMS continued their
bungling ways into the third
quarter. Thurlow again engi
neered an 87-yard drive which
died on the San Jose three when
the talented sophomore fumbled
while running the option.
The Indians got it back mo
ments later when guard Tom
Walsh recovered Gallegos’ fumble

on the San Jose seven. On thr
next play Thurlow threw a strike
to end Chuck McCormick in the
end zone. Lindskog’s boot made
it 14-6.

Kicking specialist Lindskog,
improving with every game,
came through in the closing sec
onds with a 41-yard line drive
that split the uprights with
plenty to spare for his third field
goal of the year.

SUBSTITUTE END Patitucci,
who filled in for the injured Steve
Pursell, put on a great defensive
show. The 200-pound sophomore
recovered a fumble to set up one
touchdown and intercepted a Gal
legos pass on the Stanford 33 to
kill a Spartan drive.
Linebacker Ed Cummingfe was
another key man in the Indian
defense as he came up with 10
tackles.
San Jose showed why it is one
of the top passing teams in the
country as they rolled up 161
yards. Speedy receivers Mac Bur
ton, Phil Clifton and Oscar Dona
hue, kept the Indians’ secondary
on its toes and several times got
out in front. Gallegos couldn’t
seem to connect on the long ones.


DRIVING FOR EXTRA YARDAGE
Stanford end George Honore (83) fights his way deeper into Spar
tan territory after taking a pass. Larry Doss (22) and Walt Roberts
(42) made the tackle.
