# MUSICAL QUARTERBACKS
## Coach Praises Thurlow; Will Still Rotate Three 
### TOM PARKER 
“After seeing that Michigan-
Michigan State game today, I
could have hugged our whole dog
gone team,” were the words of a
smiling, coke-drinking Jack Cur
tice in the varsity locker room
after the San Jose game. Evident
ly more impressed with his In
dians in the last game, Cactus
Jack went on to talk about the
Cards victory of the afternoon.
Curtice thought that sophomore
quarterback, Steve Thurlow,
played his best game. It was Thur
low’s keeper that sparked Stan
ford’s ground offense to 235 yards,
75 of which Thurlow was directly
responsible for.
HIS seven-yard pass to Chuck
McCormick in the end zone along
with his .571 passing average for
the game gave Curtice good rea
son for his statement.
Curtice said he had no plans
for changing his system of musi
cal quarterbacks for the Washing
ton game.
“I've been using three quarter
backs (Thurlow, Rod Sears and
Chuck Butler) since the beginning
of the season and Hickey’s been
getting all the credit.”
THE INDIANS once again lost
a first stringer because of injury,
the fifth this year. Frank Atkin
son, a sophomore who was voted
Northern California lineman of
the week in his first var-sity game,
was hit in the knee and sat out
the entire second half.
Trainer Connie Jarvis said he
won’t know until today whether
Atkinson will be able to play in
the Washington game.
The squad’s best running full
back, Ken Babajian suffered a
hip point, but is expected to be
ready for the Stanford AAWU
opener.
WHEN ASKED about how he

thought end Frank Patitucci did
in injured Steve Pursell’s place,
Cactus Jack had nothing but
praise for the big sophomore. Pati
ticci recovered a fumble, inter
cepted a pass and was in on many
key tackles.
In answer to the question, “Who
do we have to watch out for in Ihe
Big Five?” Cactus Jack said,
“With Cal beating Washington
and USC getting dumped, it kinda
looks like Cal, doesn’t it?”

WHEN ASKED about how he

thought end Frank Patitucci did
in injured Steve Pursell’s place,
Cactus Jack had nothing but
praise for the big sophomore. Pati
ticci recovered a fumble, inter
cepted a pass and was in on many
key tackles.
In answer to the question, “Who
do we have to watch out for in Ihe
Big Five?” Cactus Jack said,
“With Cal beating Washington
and USC getting dumped, it kinda
looks like Cal, doesn’t it?”
“After seeing that Michigan-
Michigan State game today, I
could have hugged our whole dog
gone team,” were the words of a
smiling, coke-drinking Jack Cur
tice in the varsity locker room
after the San Jose game. Evident
ly more impressed with his In
dians in the last game, Cactus
Jack went on to talk about the
Cards victory of the afternoon.
Curtice thought that sophomore
quarterback, Steve Thurlow,
played his best game. It was Thur
low’s keeper that sparked Stan
ford’s ground offense to 235 yards,
75 of which Thurlow was directly
responsible for.
HIS seven-yard pass to Chuck
McCormick in the end zone along
with his .571 passing average for
the game gave Curtice good rea
son for his statement.
Curtice said he had no plans
for changing his system of musi
cal quarterbacks for the Washing
ton game.
“I've been using three quarter
backs (Thurlow, Rod Sears and
Chuck Butler) since the beginning
of the season and Hickey’s been
getting all the credit.”
THE INDIANS once again lost
a first stringer because of injury,
the fifth this year. Frank Atkin
son, a sophomore who was voted
Northern California lineman of
the week in his first var-sity game,
was hit in the knee and sat out
the entire second half.
Trainer Connie Jarvis said he
won’t know until today whether
Atkinson will be able to play in
the Washington game.
The squad’s best running full
back, Ken Babajian suffered a
hip point, but is expected to be
ready for the Stanford AAWU
opener.
