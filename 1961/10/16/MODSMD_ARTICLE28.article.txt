### JOSEPH JACOBS 
“I thought the audience was
very rude when they giggled.”
said Dame Judith Anderson of
the sell-out crowd that greeted
her appearance at Memorial Audi
torium Thursday night. “I was
fighting a bar) cold and I became
quite cross at the audience.”
After her performance of sev
eral intense scenes from "Medea.”
“Macbeth” and “Tower Beyond
Tragedy,” Dame Judith relaxed
and sipped tea at a reception in
Arroyo’s lounge. “My favorite
role is Medea: it was written for
me and dedicated to me. Of
course, Lady Macbeth is a great,
great role.”
When asked why she used Rob
inson Jeffers’ adaptions of “Me
dea” and “Tower Beyond Trag
edy.” she commented, “He is a
fabulous writer; he's a great poet
with a magnificent humor. His
lines are music in my mouth; his
language is easy on my tongue.”
Although she dislikes discuss
ing other actors, she did say that
Elizabeth Taylor, with whom she
worked in “Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof.” “is a marvelous person
and a magnificent actress.”
