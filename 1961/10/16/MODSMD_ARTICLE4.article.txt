# Birch Society Individualistic, Not Fascist, Claims Rousselot
## 
### SHERRY WELCH Managing Editor 
An overflow crowd listened to
California congressman John H.
Rousselot defend the John Birch
Society Friday in a program
which developed into more of an
ineffective bandying of debate
techniques than a satisfying in
formative session on the organiza
tion.
Students wore sitting on the
stage, on the stage steps and in
the aisles of Cubberley as Rousse
lot, Republican from the 25th Dis
trict of California and a potential
candidate for Thomas Kuchel’s
seal in the U.S. Senate, began.
“THE members of the Birch So
ciety,” he said, “aim at trying to
inform themselves as to the Com
munist threat to this country and
the means we possess to fight it
by gathering together on a grass
roots, living-room level, debating,
listening to speakers and to
tapes.”
“We are not striving to imitate
the FBI,” he said. “But too many
people laugh when Khrushchev
says that he intends to bury us.
He is serious. The Birch Society
is merely an attempt to encourage
people to be better informed con
cerning the threat and to know
what our freedoms and constitu
tional privileges are.”
Rousselot denied the charge
that the society is a semi-fascist
and dictatorial group with a mon
olithic organization. He stressed
that each member is entirely in
dependent and individualistic and
said that the society Is "probably
one of the best debating societies”
he’s ever been in.

IN FACT, HE said that Birch
Society President Robert Welch
mentions in his Blue Book (a pub
lished speech by Welch in which
he sets forth the basic doctrine
of the society) that Birch Society
members “should not do anything
with which they disagree.”
The society is monolithic, he
said, only in so far as it is an ac
tive solid organization directed to
one harmonious purpose.
He also denied that the organiz
ation was in any way secretive,
and said that offer guests are in
vited to the meetings. It is true
that a person can be removed
from membership, he continued.
But this is because people with
anti-Semitic or anti-Negro views
come in and try to make the chap
ters into leagues to advance their
purposes. He said that he felt this
was not too much to ask in trying
to maintain the general purpose.
IT IS true also, he said, that
some people don't announce their
Birch Society membership, be
cause of such instances as that in
Illinois when one man was re
moved from his post as a City
Councilman in his town because
of his membership.
This, however, he blamed on the
society and its way of publicizing
itself, on the poor treatment it
has received at the hand of the

press, and on the dissemination
of mis information concerning the
society which has occurred.
Prof. John Bunzel of the Politi
cal Science Department then be
gan questions posed by a three
man panel, by accusing the Birch
Society of “looking at the world
in away that is fundamentally
conspiratory.”
Welch, he said, believes that
Communists have been at the
heart of all events from the trou
ble with the banks in ’33 to the
segregation trouble in the South.
“If you can believe the John Birch
Society and the Blue Book, you
can believe anything,” he ended.
ROUSSELOT addressed an ex
cited and at times hissing crowd
as he replied to Bunzel, telling
him that he had confused what
Welch had said in the “Blue Book”
with some of his statements in the
“black book,” “The Politician.”
which Welch wrote several years
before the formation of the Birch
Society and which is not a part of
the society doctrine.
THE second panel member,
Daily Editor Jerry Rankin, then
said that he felt the Birch Society
was using Communist smear
techniques to fight Communism,
and cited several statements made
by Welch in the “Blue Book.”
“Why can’t the Birch Society work
through the courts and not use
smear techniques which arc anti

thetical to American goals?” he
challenged.
Rousselot replied that he felt
that Mr. Welch’s statements were
near to correct, and wo must wake
up and realize we are in the great
est battle of our time.”
He ended by saying that he did
not feel the Birch Society was the
only way to deal with the Com
munist threat, but one channel of
information. “I don’t expect you
to agree with me, but I do hope
you will read to inform yourself.”
