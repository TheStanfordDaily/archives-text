# California Swelters in Heat Spell

### 
SACRAMENTO (UPD Cali
fornia sweltered in 100 dfegree
plus heat for the third straight
day yesterday.
In Los Angeles, hundreds of
heat prostration cases were re
ported. The Los Angeles high yes
terday reached a scorching 102
degrees, breaking an all-time rec
ord for Oct. 15.
RECORDS were also broken in
the San Francisco Bay Area. San
Francisco itself, usually fanned
by cool breezes at this and most
other times of the year, registered
a record high of 94.
Smog, which blanketed San
Francisco Saturday, rose slightly
above .25 particles per million
yesterday—the specified level for
eye irritation.
Los Angelos was cleared of
smog by the hot, dry, Santa Anas,
a fall wind which sweeps yearly
across the city out of the south
west. But fire hazards rose as the
winds, with occasional gusts of 60
m.p.h., dried out even more the
already dangerous brush and tim
ber areas in the surrounding
mountains.
THE coastal cities from San Di
ego to San Francisco all suffered
blistering temperatures. Highs
ranged from 97 at San Diego to
111 at Long Beach, 100 at San
Luis Obispo and past the 100 mark
for the second day at Monterey,
which is located in area noted for
bracing summer breezes.
From the Mexican border to
San Francisco, Californians
flocked to the beaches by the hun
dreds of thousands in an attempt
to cool off in the unseasonable
heat.
In Lakewood, a suburb of Los
Angeles, a power failure made
useless hundreds of air condition
ing units and electric fans for a
two-hour period in the middle of
the day. The failure w'as due to
an explosion, believed caused by
heat, at a nearby power company
transformer.
