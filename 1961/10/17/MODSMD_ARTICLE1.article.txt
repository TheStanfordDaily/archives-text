# New Stern Directors Slate Hall Improvements; Hope for Expansion of House System
## 
### ALLAN PRAGER 
A former representative of
southwest African tribes to the
United Nations and an assistant
psychology professor from Wil
liam and Mary are now directing
Stern Hall. The former. Allard K.
Lowenstein. has been appointed
assistant dean of men and lecturer
in political science as well as di
dector of Stern, Working with him
is John Balch.

Each man has taken a year's
leave from his regular work to
come to Stern in order to aid
Stanford students in the develop
ment of a house plan. “People
should decide where to live with
out social pressure,” said Lowen
stein.

ALTHOUGH HE is director of
the hall, “direct,” said Lowen
stein, “is the antithesis of what I
believe." He feels that his role is
to assist individuals and make
only suggestions on improve
ments. Part of his job, he said, “is
to assist student government to
make Stern more attractive.”
To this end, he and Balch have
many suggestions. Physical im
provements, evening speaker pro
grams practically every night,
building up the Stern library are
among them. Balch also favored
another idea: bringing women in
to Stern. He noted that other col
leges have done this successfully
and explained that certain of the
Stern houses could be set aside
for women.

Lowenstein was particularly up
timistic about the freshmen in
Stern. “Their spirit has been a
great boon,” he said, and added he
hopes that they will want to stay
at Stern next year. The Stern men
took particular pains to see that
the freshmen were properly wel
comed.
A NUMBER of volunters se
lected last spring came back early
this quarter to help the frosh get
settled. Headed by Jim Corn,
these volunteers “did not get paid
and worked like fanatics,” said
Lowenstein. “They even had to
buy their own meals,” ho added.
Lowenstein has led a varied life.
A graduate of the University of
North Carolina with a degree in
law from Yale, ho is a member of
the Bar Association of the State
of New York. He has been active
in the Democratic Party as chair
man of the Students for Steven
son in 1952 and as an alternate
delegate to the Democratic Na
tional Convention in 1960.
He has written a hook on cur
rent affairs in southwest Africa
which will be published this
month.

Batch, according to Lowenstein,
“is the only man in the history of
the Ivy League to pin three men in
three weeks in three different
weight divisions. He even had a
full-page picture in ‘Sports Illus
trated 1 ,” added Lowenstein. Balch
is an ex-high school wrestling
coach.
Balch and Lowenstein both said
they were happy to be at Stan
ford and said they would have
been lost the first few weeks with
out help from the resident assist
ants in Stern, assistant dean of
men David Larimer and the office
staff in Stern.

building up the Stern library are
among them. Balch also favored
another idea: bringing women in
to Stern. He noted that other col
leges have done this successfully
and explained that certain of the
Stern houses could be set aside
for women.

Lowenstein was particularly up
timistic about the freshmen in
Stern. “Their spirit has been a
great boon,” he said, and added he
hopes that they will want to stay
at Stern next year. The Stern men
took particular pains to see that
the freshmen were properly wel
comed.
A NUMBER of volunters se
lected last spring came back early
this quarter to help the frosh get
settled. Headed by Jim Corn,
these volunteers “did not get paid
and worked like fanatics,” said
Lowenstein. “They even had to
buy their own meals,” ho added.
Lowenstein has led a varied life.
A graduate of the University of
North Carolina with a degree in
law from Yale, ho is a member of
the Bar Association of the State
of New York. He has been active
in the Democratic Party as chair
man of the Students for Steven
son in 1952 and as an alternate
delegate to the Democratic Na
tional Convention in 1960.
He has written a hook on cur
rent affairs in southwest Africa
which will be published this
month.

Batch, according to Lowenstein,
“is the only man in the history of
the Ivy League to pin three men in
three weeks in three different
weight divisions. He even had a
full-page picture in ‘Sports Illus
trated 1 ,” added Lowenstein. Balch
is an ex-high school wrestling
coach.
Balch and Lowenstein both said
they were happy to be at Stan
ford and said they would have
been lost the first few weeks with
out help from the resident assist
ants in Stern, assistant dean of
men David Larimer and the office
staff in Stern.


STERN HALL DIRECTORS JOHN BALCH (I), ALLARD LOWENSTEIN
Will help "make Stern more attractive"
A former representative of
southwest African tribes to the
United Nations and an assistant
psychology professor from Wil
liam and Mary are now directing
Stern Hall. The former. Allard K.
Lowenstein. has been appointed
assistant dean of men and lecturer
in political science as well as di
dector of Stern, Working with him
is John Balch.

Each man has taken a year's
leave from his regular work to
come to Stern in order to aid
Stanford students in the develop
ment of a house plan. “People
should decide where to live with
out social pressure,” said Lowen
stein.

ALTHOUGH HE is director of
the hall, “direct,” said Lowen
stein, “is the antithesis of what I
believe." He feels that his role is
to assist individuals and make
only suggestions on improve
ments. Part of his job, he said, “is
to assist student government to
make Stern more attractive.”
To this end, he and Balch have
many suggestions. Physical im
provements, evening speaker pro
grams practically every night,
building up the Stern library are
among them. Balch also favored
another idea: bringing women in
to Stern. He noted that other col
