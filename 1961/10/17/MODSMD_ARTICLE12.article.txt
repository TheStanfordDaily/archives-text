# New Microfilms Arrive at Hoover
## 
### 
Microfilm copies of more than
1,100 documents describing inter
nal operations of the Chinese
Communists during the early
1930’s have been obtained by the
Hoover Institution.
The most important single
group of Chinese Communist
Party documents ever acquired
by a Western library, according to
Eugene Wu, curator of the Insti
tution’s Chinese collection, the
microfilms were copied from the
private collection of Chen Cheng,
vice president of the Republic of
China.
The collection consists primari
ly of internal and intra-party doc
uments including party directives
and various materials issued by
provincial and local Communist
committees in Kiangsi during
19.31-34. It is microfilmed on a set
of 21, 100-foot reels.
In addition, the Institution has
microfilmed copies of 150 Chinese
Communist publications which de
tail the Communists’ struggle to
power immediately after World
War 11. Included are reports on
various “liberated’’ areas which
fell under Communist control.
