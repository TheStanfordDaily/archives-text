Khrushchev later this week will
unfold his vision of the “golden
age of the- Communist future”
and his plans to turn Russia into
a Utopia within 20 years.
EAST-WEST negotiations aimed
at easing the Berlin crises were in
a state of suspended animation
waiting for his speech which is
expected to last from six to eight
hours and give the Soviet position
on everything from nuclear war
fare to consumer goods.
The party congress is the legiti
mate constitutional authority for
the Communist world and has
brought to Moscow such Commun
ists as Premier Chou En-lai of
Communist China, Walter Ul
bricht of East Germany, Janos
Kadar of Plungary and Ho Chi
Minh of North Viet Nam.
THOSE COMMUNIST leaders
are expected to hold a summit con
ference of their own during or
just after the congress itself. That
meeting may be of importance be
cause the presence of Chou gave
indication a reported split be
tween Peiping and Moscow had
been healed.
