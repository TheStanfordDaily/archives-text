## East, West Deadlocked In Laos 'Tug-of-War' 
### RUTHERFORD POATS 
WASHINGTON 1UPI) The
next few weeks could tell the tale
of deadlocked efforts to end the
East-West tug-of-war over Laos.
The brightest note in months
was sounded last week when the
three rival Laotian princes voted
to accept neutralist Souvanna
Phouma as premier of the tiny
nation.

But major difficulties remain—
such as selection of a coalition
cabinet, and terms for policing
the shaky cease-fire in Laos.
IN THE background, the United
States and its Allies in the South-
East Treaty Organization
(SEATO) have studied the possi
bility of sending a “warning
force” to block Communist drives
in Southeast Asia.

Authoritative American sources
say this plan still is up in the air.
They also have termed immature
leports implying that President
Kennedy is considering sending
American troops into the troubled
area.

Officials say Kennedy is giving
Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrush
chev another chance to keep his
word on promoting a workable
neutralization of Laos.

THIS, coupled with a conviction
of U.S. determination to fight if
necessary, was one of the mes
sages American officials hoped
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko would take to Moscow
from his talk with Kennedy.
To demonstrate this willingness
to make a stand in Southeast
Asia is a big reason behind the
long-standing contingency plan to
base a relatively small SEATO

force in northern Thailand.
During the uninspected cease
fire in Laos, the North Vietnam
ese Communists have built up
forces in extreme southern Laos
which they are now f unneling into
South Vietnam to the East and
from which they also could strike
into Thailand in the West.

PUBLISHED speculation that
American forces would go into
South Vietnam at this stage of its
war against the Viet Cong gueril
las was described as “nonsense”
by a high U.S. official.
A Vietnamese diplomat agreed.
President Ngo Dinh Diem does
not want, has not asked for and
does not need American fighting
units unless the North Vietnamese
or Chinese Communists invade in
overwhelming force, the diplomat
said.

South Vietnam’s struggle
against the Communist undercov
er invasion still is as much a po
litical and psychological battle as
a shooting war.
RECENTLY formed U.S.-South
Vietnamese plans to win this war
called for concentration on
strengthening of economic and po
litical defenses, as well as on re
organization and a small buildup
of Diem’s armed forces.

The Communists now appear to
be concentrating their major ef
fort in this high plateau area,
near the Red pocket in southeast
ern Laos.

By getting even temporary co
operation from anti-Diem peas
ants and mountain people, they
can pose a much bigger threat
than the estimated 15,000-man
Viet Cong fighting strength in
dicates.

They also have termed immature
leports implying that President
Kennedy is considering sending
American troops into the troubled
area.

Officials say Kennedy is giving
Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrush
chev another chance to keep his
word on promoting a workable
neutralization of Laos.

THIS, coupled with a conviction
of U.S. determination to fight if
necessary, was one of the mes
sages American officials hoped
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko would take to Moscow
from his talk with Kennedy.
To demonstrate this willingness
to make a stand in Southeast
Asia is a big reason behind the
long-standing contingency plan to
base a relatively small SEATO

force in northern Thailand.
During the uninspected cease
fire in Laos, the North Vietnam
ese Communists have built up
forces in extreme southern Laos
which they are now f unneling into
South Vietnam to the East and
from which they also could strike
into Thailand in the West.

PUBLISHED speculation that
American forces would go into
South Vietnam at this stage of its
war against the Viet Cong gueril
las was described as “nonsense”
by a high U.S. official.
A Vietnamese diplomat agreed.
President Ngo Dinh Diem does
not want, has not asked for and
does not need American fighting
units unless the North Vietnamese
or Chinese Communists invade in
overwhelming force, the diplomat
said.

South Vietnam’s struggle
against the Communist undercov
er invasion still is as much a po
litical and psychological battle as
a shooting war.
RECENTLY formed U.S.-South
Vietnamese plans to win this war
called for concentration on
strengthening of economic and po
litical defenses, as well as on re
organization and a small buildup
of Diem’s armed forces.

The Communists now appear to
be concentrating their major ef
fort in this high plateau area,
near the Red pocket in southeast
ern Laos.

By getting even temporary co
operation from anti-Diem peas
ants and mountain people, they
can pose a much bigger threat
than the estimated 15,000-man
Viet Cong fighting strength in
dicates.
WASHINGTON 1UPI) The
next few weeks could tell the tale
of deadlocked efforts to end the
East-West tug-of-war over Laos.
The brightest note in months
was sounded last week when the
three rival Laotian princes voted
to accept neutralist Souvanna
Phouma as premier of the tiny
nation.

But major difficulties remain—
such as selection of a coalition
cabinet, and terms for policing
the shaky cease-fire in Laos.
IN THE background, the United
States and its Allies in the South-
East Treaty Organization
(SEATO) have studied the possi

in Southeast Asia.
