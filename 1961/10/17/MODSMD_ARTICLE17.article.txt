CONSERVATISM

Editor, The Daily;
Barry Greenberg’s article on the
"Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives” is
a remarkable example of logical
exposition. Only the second sen
tence seems somewhat extrane
ous, and its presence forces me to
conclude that Mr. Greenberg is not
aware of what his article actually
proves. The hypothesis is clearly
stated in the first sentence: “I am
a ‘fuzzy-minded’ liberal.” Every
thing which follows, with the ex
ception of the extraneous state
ment of the objective, clearly sub
stantiates this.

This article, as do all too many
others written by both “liberals”
and “conservatives,” fails to give
serious consideration to perhaps
the most critical issue at hand.
Namely, that we are engaged in a
deadly serious ideological conflict
with an adversary who i« deter
mined to destroy us. The light
mindedness and petty quarreling
which characterize so much of the
liberal-conservative controversy
indicate that many on both sides
do not fully grasp the seriousness
of the situation. In particular, as
soon as someone groups a large
number of individuals together,
labels them, and then precedes to
vilify them in accordance with
what this label suggests to him, I
am forced to discount many of his
remarks.

We are faced with the problem
of preserving as many of our
rights as possible, however these
may be defined, in the face of the
grave danger of losing them all.
We must certainly continue striv
ing to clarify our definition of
these rights, but we cannot di
vorce ourselves from our environ
ment in so doing. “The American
way’’ cannot be, as Mr. Greenberg
would have it, “the right of every
American to define ‘the American
way’ as he sees fit.” This is both
dangerous and chaotic. It must
rather be the product of serious
consideration and cooperation
among men of diverse opinions
who would live together harmoni
ously. Petty editorializing contrib
utes precious little to this goal.

choice between centralized control
and individuality, they must
choose individuality or remain
hypocrites.
We propose in like manner In
consistency No. 1A: Liberals uni

whenever there is a choice be
tween centralized control and in
dividuality, they must choose cen

It is obvious that both Inconsis

and are developed in a totally il

A discussion will give grounds

We refer to the article by Mr.

we wish to thank him for clearing
up certain questions which have
always been a plague of uncer
tainty.

Inconsistency No. 1 says essen
tially: Conservatives unilaterally
maintain freedom of the individu
al, Therefore, whenever there is a
choice between centralized control
and individuality, they must
choose individuality or remain
hypocrites.
We propose in like manner In
consistency No. 1A: Liberals uni
laterally maintain complete na
tional welfare state. Therefore
whenever there is a choice be
tween centralized control and in
dividuality, they must choose cen
tralized control or remain hypo
crites.

It is obvious that both Inconsis
tencies I and IA are based on nu
merous incorrect assumptions,
and are developed in a totally il
logical manner. Finally, it is cer
tain that the conclusions drawn
from arguments I and IA would
be as illogical as the arguments
themselves.

A discussion will give grounds
for acceptance of an opinion. A
logical and factual discussion ap
peals to intellectual people. A
purely emotional discussion ap
peals only to excitable people who
will not look for an intelligent
discussion.

(Does Greenberg place Stanford

submit that the ideas and opin

Editor, The Daily;
Barry Greenberg’s article on the
"Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives” is
a remarkable example of logical
exposition. Only the second sen
tence seems somewhat extrane
ous, and its presence forces me to
conclude that Mr. Greenberg is not
aware of what his article actually
proves. The hypothesis is clearly
stated in the first sentence: “I am
a ‘fuzzy-minded’ liberal.” Every
thing which follows, with the ex
ception of the extraneous state
ment of the objective, clearly sub
stantiates this.

This article, as do all too many
others written by both “liberals”
and “conservatives,” fails to give
serious consideration to perhaps
the most critical issue at hand.
Namely, that we are engaged in a
deadly serious ideological conflict
with an adversary who i« deter
mined to destroy us. The light
mindedness and petty quarreling
which characterize so much of the
liberal-conservative controversy
indicate that many on both sides
do not fully grasp the seriousness
of the situation. In particular, as
soon as someone groups a large
number of individuals together,
labels them, and then precedes to

“Fuzzy-Minded Conservatives”
written backwards spells Sevitav
resnoc Dednim-Yzzuf. This is sig
nificant when one realizes that
this is a fact and not just an opin
ion.

We refer to the article by Mr.
Greenberg on Friday, Oct. 13, and
we wish to thank him for clearing
up certain questions which have
always been a plague of uncer
tainty.

Inconsistency No. 1 says essen
tially: Conservatives unilaterally
maintain freedom of the individu
al, Therefore, whenever there is a
choice between centralized control
and individuality, they must
choose individuality or remain
hypocrites.
We propose in like manner In
consistency No. 1A: Liberals uni
laterally maintain complete na
tional welfare state. Therefore
whenever there is a choice be
tween centralized control and in
dividuality, they must choose cen
tralized control or remain hypo
crites.

It is obvious that both Inconsis
tencies I and IA are based on nu
merous incorrect assumptions,
and are developed in a totally il
logical manner. Finally, it is cer
tain that the conclusions drawn
from arguments I and IA would
be as illogical as the arguments
themselves.

A discussion will give grounds
for acceptance of an opinion. A
logical and factual discussion ap
peals to intellectual people. A
purely emotional discussion ap
peals only to excitable people who
will not look for an intelligent
discussion.

(Does Greenberg place Stanford
students into this category?) We
submit that the ideas and opin
ions in this article are supported
with poor emotional arguments
as seen in Inconsistency No. I.
And, as such, they have no place
in any serious discussion in a
University publication where in
telligent people expect intelligent
discussion.
