CONSERVATIVES
Editor, The Daily:
William Buckley, Barry Gold
water and Robert Welch are Con
servatives, but “Conservative” has
many meanings. During the 16th,
17th and 18th centuries the term
referred to men who wanted pow
er concentrated in government.
They argued “Man is too self
seeking and forms too readily into
warring factions to live under
weak government.” Liberals ar
gued . . . “ Man is essentially ra :
tional and responsible; therefore,
a minimum of government is best,
since it allows more freedom.”
The distinction between econom
ic and political power was not
made by those Conservatives;
they were synonymous. If you
were rich and “well-born” you had
political power.
Today, the Liberals still want
power divided among the people
so that all will have liberty. The
Conservatives still want power to
control men. However, they differ
as to which sort of power they
wish to have in control economic
or political.
Buckley, Goldwater and Welch
. . . have a program designed to
make money the ruler. First, they
would remove the income tax,
allowing the rich to get richer.
Second, they would remove the
inheritance tax, allowing the
growth of an economic elite. Gold
water wants every parent to pay
the entire cost of his children’s
education. Poor children could
fight for those scholarships
thrown them by the rich. This is
economic, conservatism.

Political conservatism is a cry
for strong central government.
The lost power of the executive

. . . would be re-established. Con
gress would be reduced to its orig
inal power.
The Administration having
been duly elected—would govern.
. . . After four years the people
could vote it out if they did not

like its policies.
There are many detailed argu
ments for and against political
conservatism. This position has
its detractors, both liberals and
economic conservatives.

Nevertheless, it must be recog
nized as a form of conservative
thought. It is all too often called
a liberal position because its ad
vocates are most often Democrats.
