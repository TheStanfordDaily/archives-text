# BERLIN BARRICADE
## Workers Turned Back On Way to U.S. Sector 
### 
BERLIN —( UPI)— Communist East German police yesterday
turned back a West Berlin work crew sent out to cross one mile of
Soviet Zone territory to build a street in the isolated U.S. sector
enclave of Steinstuecken.
The new road was to replace one cut off by Communist barbed

wire that barred direct access of
Steinstuecken housewives to the
Red-surrounded community’s only
grocery. The housewives now
have to walk across fields and
through woods to get to the store.
THERE WAS speculation that
American authorities might airlift
the six workmen by helicopter.
U.S. officials previously had used
helicopters to fly out East Ger
man refugees who managed to
slip through the barbed wire into
Steinstuecken.
Five persons jumped into West
Berlin from East sector homes
when they spotted a truck carry
ing sand in a West Berlin street
outside their windows. They sig
nalled the driver they were going
to jump into the sand and he
waited for them. Other refugees
climbed the wall, let themselves
down on ropes, or swam the Spree
River to West Berlin.
DESPITE reports the Commun
ists had booby-trapped their bor
der barrier with blank ammuni
tion to warn police of escaping
refugees, Western officials said 20
more persons fled to the Allied
sectors yesterday.
