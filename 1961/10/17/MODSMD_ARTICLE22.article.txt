# Soccermen Lose to Spartans, 2-1 With Three Starters Ineligible
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Friday 13th, That’s it in a nut
shell. All the bad luck that could
possibly happen to a soccer team
happened to Stanford on Friday,
October 13th.
Not only did Stanford lose to
San Jose 2-1, but they also lost
three first string players for the
season and had their leading
scorer, Emmanuel Andah, unable
to play because he was hospital
ized with minor surgery.
The scoreboard clock said that
the game was lost at 9:45 p.m.,
when the gun ended the game, but
actually Stanford was immobil
ized at 11:00 a.m. Friday morning,
when a directive from the regis
trar’s office said that all-confer
ence fullback Dan Farthing, sec
ond team all-conference wing
Adam Bianchi and first string de
fensive back Rune Engebrettsen,
were ineligible to play soccer.
Despite the fact that Stanford
soccer coach Fred Priddle was un

able to hold a single practice ses
sion with the makeshift unit he
was forced to field, Stanford al
most beat San Jose Stale. In fact,
Stanford completely outplayed the
Spartans, and should have won.
Stanford got off on the right
foot, with a goal by Larry Chuk
wudbe after only four minutes
had elapsed in the first quarter.
Chukwudbe drove past the right
halfback, faked out the fullback,
and punched the ball past a very
surprised goalie.
STANFORD luck turned bad
again, with only a minute left in
the quarter. Two San Jose for
wards belted Stanford goalie
Hunt Bascom as he fielded a shot.
Oscar Guitterez put the loose hall
in to tie the scoi'e.
In the second quarter Stanford
again scored, to the satisfaction
of everyone but the official. The
referee ruled that a Stanford shot
had hit the underside of the top
bar holding up the net, and had
not gone completely in the goal.

More bad luck.
San Jose scored their winning
goal in the third quarter. Bascom
blocked a Spartan shot with a
long leap, and deflected the ball.
A San Jose man fielded the loose
ball, and shots began flying at
Bascom like snowflakes. Dietmar
Demeter finally scored the win
ning goal.
THE TWO goalies were almost
the whole show. Stanford’s Bas
com, and the Spartan’s Slobodan
Caleb controlled the game. Both
teams displayed a porous back
line in the first half, and the score
would have mounted rapidly, had
not Bascom and Caleb played su
perbly.
The Stanford defense lightened
up in the second half, but San
Jose had nothing to help Caleb,
and twice he single-handedly
saved goals from winning the
game for Stanford.
Bascom was as good, often
coming out of the goal to save the
fullbacks with powerful kicks and
running catches.
After the game, Priddle singled
out Bascom and halfback Rusty
Williams as Stanford’s outstand
ing players, and praised the whole
team for working so well together
without the benefit of practicing
as a unit.

Adam Bianchi and first string de
fensive back Rune Engebrettsen,
were ineligible to play soccer.
Despite the fact that Stanford
soccer coach Fred Priddle was un

able to hold a single practice ses
sion with the makeshift unit he
was forced to field, Stanford al
most beat San Jose Stale. In fact,
Stanford completely outplayed the
Spartans, and should have won.
Stanford got off on the right
foot, with a goal by Larry Chuk
wudbe after only four minutes
had elapsed in the first quarter.
Chukwudbe drove past the right
halfback, faked out the fullback,
and punched the ball past a very
surprised goalie.
STANFORD luck turned bad
again, with only a minute left in
the quarter. Two San Jose for
wards belted Stanford goalie
Hunt Bascom as he fielded a shot.
Oscar Guitterez put the loose hall
in to tie the scoi'e.
In the second quarter Stanford
again scored, to the satisfaction
of everyone but the official. The
referee ruled that a Stanford shot
had hit the underside of the top
bar holding up the net, and had
not gone completely in the goal.

More bad luck.
San Jose scored their winning
goal in the third quarter. Bascom
blocked a Spartan shot with a
long leap, and deflected the ball.
A San Jose man fielded the loose
ball, and shots began flying at
Bascom like snowflakes. Dietmar
Demeter finally scored the win
ning goal.
THE TWO goalies were almost
the whole show. Stanford’s Bas
com, and the Spartan’s Slobodan
Caleb controlled the game. Both
teams displayed a porous back
line in the first half, and the score
would have mounted rapidly, had
not Bascom and Caleb played su
perbly.
The Stanford defense lightened
up in the second half, but San
Jose had nothing to help Caleb,
and twice he single-handedly
saved goals from winning the
game for Stanford.
Bascom was as good, often
coming out of the goal to save the
fullbacks with powerful kicks and
running catches.
After the game, Priddle singled
out Bascom and halfback Rusty
Williams as Stanford’s outstand
ing players, and praised the whole
team for working so well together
without the benefit of practicing
as a unit.
Friday 13th, That’s it in a nut
shell. All the bad luck that could
possibly happen to a soccer team
happened to Stanford on Friday,
October 13th.
Not only did Stanford lose to
San Jose 2-1, but they also lost
three first string players for the
season and had their leading
scorer, Emmanuel Andah, unable
to play because he was hospital
ized with minor surgery.
The scoreboard clock said that
the game was lost at 9:45 p.m.,
when the gun ended the game, but
actually Stanford was immobil
ized at 11:00 a.m. Friday morning,
when a directive from the regis
trar’s office said that all-confer

were ineligible to play soccer.
