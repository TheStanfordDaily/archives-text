### Ron Rapoport 
While engaged in a particularly frustrating pastime described by
its master practicioner, Red Smith, as "sitting before a typewriter
and concentrating until little beads of blood form on the brow,” a
most welcome interruption presented itself. The mail came.
Perched atop a form letter which enjoined the l eader to impeach
Earl Warren and implore his friends to do the same, was an eagerly

anticipated communication. It was
from Sumner Mitchell, a Stanford
graduate (class of '33 and a quiet
ly sensitive and astute individual.
Sumner tends bar in a small town
several hundred miles north of
here and is a particularly rabid
Stanford football fan.
The first time Sumner wrote
this department was almost ex
actly a year ago after Stanford’s
humiliating defeat to San Jose.
That letter was in reference to a
column which had tried to de
scribe the mood of the campus
after a bad defeat at the hands of
its prime patsy.
Although Sumner had agreed
with most of the facts and conclu
sions drawn in the column, he had
protested that it was lacking in
any kind of a perceptive outlook.
He then proceeded to give his
views on the situation.

Since then a correspondence of sorts has developed. The latest
installment was as follows:
A Letter from Sumner
“Dear Fink:’’ ( a term of relative affection reportedly first used
by Hie Egyptians who tried to chase Moses across the Red Sea)
“First let me welcome Stanford back to the land of the living.
And I most happily admit that it looks like they are there to stay.
I arrive at (his conclusion after spending Saturday morning watching
(he televised game from Ann Arbor, Mich., with as much care as an
occasional moment of customer-attending would allow, and after
reading (he accounts of Stanford's contest with San Jose.
“You will remember my warning that comparative scores can he
misleading but some comparisons between Stanford’s performance
against Michigan Stale on Oct. 7 and Michigan’s more recent showing
against the Spartans might be legitimate. Perhaps the fact that State
beat both teams by 28 points doesn’t mean Stanford would tie
Michigan, but at least Stanford didn't have Michigan State thinking
about next week's game before the first half was over.
“The Wolverines (is that an Indian word for pushovers?) were
never really in the game which, if you saw it, you know.” (I <1 id
and they weren’t) “You couldn’t even say they fell apart after MSU’s
first two touchdowns. They had no place to fall from. Michigan was
finished halfway through the first quarter. State didn’t move away
from Stanford until the third period.
“Thus the results of the game were inconclusive and that’s more
than you could say about Stanford four games into last season. Just
because these games don’t prove Stanford is necessarily as good as
Michigan; they don’t prove the Indians are necessarily NOT as good.
I.ike I say, it’s quite an accomplishment to be mentioning (he two
teams in the same sentences.
Could Have Meant Disaster
“As for Stanford's win over San Jose, I admit to being impressed.
The thought was beginning to strike me that (his season could have
ended in disaster. I mean you could make a case for the win over
Tulane having come on a 47-yard lucky break (which, God knows,
the Indians had coming to them). And Stanford always does well
against Oregon State (Maybe Prothro wasn’t being a big baby; maybe
(hey really DID quit on him).
“But, as I say, a loss to San Jose would have been a major
calamity from which Stanford may never have recovered. The fears
were for nothing. Congratulations again. Good luck against Washing
ton next week. They should he ready for you after losing to Cal. No
more inconclusive games for Stanford this year. Write and tell me
again why I shouldn't become more excited about your chances for
the Rose Howl. Tin* impulse is irresistible.”
