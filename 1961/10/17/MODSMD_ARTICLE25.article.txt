## Huskies Tough Says Curtice 
### 
Stanford lineman Frank Pati
tucci and California quarterback
Larry Balliet were named lineman
and back of the week by the Big
Five, and the Northern California
coaches at yesterday’s luncheon in
San Francisco. Patitucci was a
standout for the Indians on de
fense, while at Berkeley Balliett
led the Bears to their first season
victory over the Washington
Huskies, 21-14.
Coach Jack Curtice told the
guests that there is a need for
more rules and better equipment
in high school football to put the
damper on the serious injuries
that have come up in recent
weeks. As to his squad’s defeat of
the San Jose Spartans, “Cactus”
Jack maintained that the team's
ball control worked quite well . . .
until Stanford fumbled.
This week, however, the Indian
mentor expects Washington to be
keyed up for his Indians. The
Huskies will now have the serv
ices of speedster Charlie Mitchell
who was sidelined against the
Bears. Sophomore tackle Frank
Atkinson, sidelined in the first
half of the San Jose game with a
leg injury, might be on hand this
weekend to bolster the Indian at
tack. As for the Huskies, “if
Washington has any weaknesses,
it’s beyond their second team.”
