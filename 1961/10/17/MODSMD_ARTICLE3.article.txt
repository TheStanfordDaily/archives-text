# Snowing in East! It Won't in West
## 
### 
A crazy mixed-up national
weather pattern broiled the west
coast in record heat and dumped
up to four inches of snow in upper
New Plngland yesterday.
Southern Californians continue
to swelter in a week-long heat
wave. The mercury soared near
the 100 mark at several points
but the Weather Bureau predicted
it would not reach Sundayâ€™s high
of 107 degrees recorded at Long
Beach and Los Angeles.
Relief is due in the Bay area
which baked in 04 degrees yester
day.
