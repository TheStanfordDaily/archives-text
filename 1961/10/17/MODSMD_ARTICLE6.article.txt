WASHINGTON (UPI) Allied
differences over Berlin talks with
Russia forced postponement yes
terday of Ambassador Llewellyn
Thompson’s return to Moscow and
cancellation of a Western Big
Four meeting in London.
At the heart of the dispute was
French President Charles de
Gaulle's insistence that even ex
ploratory talks with the Soviets
would be premature now. Ho
wants some sign of Russian con
cessions before going to the con
ference table.
ON THE other hand, the United
Stales and Britain favor going
ahead with exploratory discus
sions—such as the recent Ken
nedy-Gromyko talk to see if
some basis can be reached for
later East-West negotiations on
the Berlin crisis.

Confronted by this split. Thomp
son postponed his departure for
Moscow to attend Allied strategy
talks at the State Department. He
hoped to get a clearer picture of
just where the West stands on the
question of further discussions
with the Soviets.

Thompson originally was sched
uled to return to Moscow before
the opening today of Russia’s
22nd Communist Party Congress
and then try again to sound out
the Soviets on possible Berlin so
lutions.

THU STATE Department said
the ambassador now may slay in
Washington for at least the rest
of this week. But department
press officer Lincoln White also
said Thompson was expected to
go ahead with his “exploratory”
talks after reaching the Soviet
capital.

Whatever form the Allied talks
take, their purpose will be to work
out a more detailed Western po
sition, including a decision on just
what points are negotiable in the
Berlin crisis and which are not.
