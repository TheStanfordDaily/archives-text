# Certain Groups Out to Destroy Peace Corps?
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD The
Peace Corps charged yesterday
that demonstrations sparked by
an American teacher’s postcard
about primitive living conditions
in Nigeria showed that “certain
groups” are out to destroy the
corps.
But a spokesman vowed that
the corps was in Africa to stay.
He said the intensity of efforts to
discredit the youth groups “is an
indication of the value of the
Peace Corps.”
The spokesman did not elabor
ate on what “certain groups”
might have been behind the anti-
Peace Corps demonstration in Ni
geria Sunday. It was touched off
by a postcard from Margery
Michelmore, 23-year-old Corps
member from Foxboro, Mass.,
who is training in the country.
She has apologized for her re
marks and offered to resign.
A Peace Corps spokesman said
Sunday that “outright Communist
agitation” might have been be
hind the interception, reproduc
tion and distribution of Miss
Michclmore’s postcard to a friend.
But Peace Corps Director R. Sar
gent Shriver termed this a pre
mature judgment.
State Department spokesman
Lincoln White said yesterday that
the demonstration, “far from be
ing a large affair as described by
several press reports, actually
consisted of no more than 150
people.”
