# Stanford Sadie To Seduce Soon
## 
### 
Auditions are now being held
for the role of Stanford Sadie, si
ren of the airways, who returns
to KZSU this fall on Monday
nights at 9 p.m.
All women interested in playing
the role of Sadie or working on
the production crew for the pro
gram should call DA 5-0880 im
mediately, as rehearsals must be
gin within a few days, and ask for
either Frank Keinerer or Doug
Peterson.

Sadie’s duties will consist of the
usual Monday night broadcasts
plus seductive time spots. She
will give weekly advice to Wilbur
men and frosh dollies after her
broadcasts.

The man winning the Sadie con
test to be announced later in the
quarter will unmask the identity
of the mysterious Sadie and win

an all-expense paid date with
Sadie to the city.
Sadie’s history of mystery, love
lorn advice, and Date with Sadie
contests began in 1946 when
KZSU first came on the air. She
disappeared from the airways two
years ago when conflicts with the
university and the FCC prevented
KZSU from broadcasting.
