HOWARD HUGHES DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS. If you are
interested in studies leading to a doctor's degree in physics or
engineering, you are invited to apply for one of the several new
awards in 1952 on the Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowship Program.
This unique program offers the doctoral candidate, the optimum
combination of high-level study at an outstanding institution plus
practical industrial experience in the Hughes laboratories.
Each Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowship usually provides about
$B,OOO annually. Of this amount approximately $l,BOO is for tuition,
thesis and research expenses, other academic fees and books. The
remainder is composed of salary earned by the fellow and a stipend.
Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowships are open to outstanding stu
dents. A master’s degree, or equivalent graduate work, is essential
before beginning the Fellowship Program.
HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. The Hughes Masters
Fellowship Program offers unusual opportunities for education lead
ing to a master’s degree . . . and, in addition, provides each fellow
with practical experience in the professional field of his choice.
Approximately fifty new awards will be made in 1962 to qualified
applicants possessing a bachelor's degree in engineering or physics.
Most of the award winners will be assigned to the WORK STUDY
PROGRAM and will attend a university sufficiently near a facility of
the Hughes Aircraft Company to permit them to obtain practical
experience in a professional field of their choice, by working at the
company at least half time. An appropriate stipend will be awarded.
A small, highly selected group will be offered a FULL-STUDY
PROGRAM. Participants in this program will receive fellowships that
permit them to attend an outstanding university on a full time basis
during the regular academic year with a substantial stipend.
After completion of the Master’s Program, fellows are eligible to
apply for HUGHES STAFF DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS.
For both programs, typical areas of research and development to
which fellows may be assigned while working for Hughes include:
weapons control systems, infrared search and track systems,
advanced propulsion systems... parametric amplifiers, masers,
lasers, microwave tubes and devices, electron-tube and solid-state
displays, semiconductor materials, antenna arrays, aerospace
vehicles and trajectories... plasma electronics; solid-state, atomic,
nuclear and aerospace physics; propagation, mechanics of struc
tures, chemistry and metallurgy... systems analysis, human factors
and analysis, network analysis and synthesis... microminiaturiza
tion, communications, date processing, information theory,
simulation.
The classified nature of work at Hughes makes American citizenship
and eligibility for security clearance a requirement.
Closing date for applications: January 15, 1962.

Fellowship or the Hughes Masters Fellowships write Dr. C. N.
