THE TRUE AND
HARROWING FACTS ABOUT RUSHING
It is well enougn to sit in one’s Morris chair and theorize about
sorority rushing, but if one really wishes to know the facts, one
must leave one’s Morris chair and go out into the field. (My
Morris chair, incidentally, was given to me by the Philip Morris
Company, makers of Marlboro Cigarettes. They are great
hearted folk, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, as millions of
you know who have enjoyed their excellent cigarettes. Only
from bountiful souls could come such mildness, such flavor,
such filters, such pleasure, as you will find in Marlboros! For
those who prefer crashproof boxes, Marlboro is available in
crashproof boxes. For those who prefer soft pa*ks, Marlboro
is available in soft packs. For those who prefer to buy their
cigarettes in bulk, please contact Emmett R. Sigafoos, friendly
manager of our factory in Richmond, Virginia.)
Rut I digress. I was saying that in order to know the true
facts about sorority rushing, one must go into the field and
investigate. Consequently, I went last week to the Indiana
College of Spot Welding and Belles Lettres and interviewed
several million coeds, among them a lovely lass named Gerund
McKeever. (It is, incidentally, quite an interesting little story
about how she came to be named Gerund. It seems that her
father, Ralph T. McKeever, loved grammar better than any
thing in the world, and so he named all his children after parts
of speech. In addition to Gerund, there were three girls named
Preposition, Adverb, and Pronoun, and one boy named Dative
Case. 1 he girls seemed not to be unduly depressed by their
names, but Dative Case, alas, grew steadily more morose and
was finally found one night dangling from a participle. After
this tragic event, the father abandoned his practice of gram
matical nomenclature, and whatever children were subsequently
born to him—eight in all—were named Everett.)

But I digress. I was interviewing a lovely coed named
Gerund McKeever. “Gerund,” I said, “were you rushed by a
sorority?”
“Yes, mister,” she said, “I was rushed by a sorority.”
“Did they give you a high-pressure pitch?” I asked. “Did
they use the hard sell?”
“No, mister,” she replied. “It was all done with quiet dignity.
They simply talked to me about the chapter and the girls for
about three minutes and then I pledged.”
“My goodness!” I said. “Three minutes is not very long for
a sales talk!”
“It is when they are holding you under water, mister,”
said Gerund.
“Well, Gerund,” I said, “how do you like the house?”
“I like the house fine, mister,” she replied. “But I don’t live
there. Unfortunately, they pledged more girls than they have
room for, so they are sleeping some of us in the bell tower.”
“Isn’t that rather noisy?” I said.
“Only on the quarter-hour,” said Gerund.
“Well, Gerund,” I said, “it has certainly been a pleasure talk
ing to you,” I said.
“Likewise, mister,” she said, and with many a laugh and cheer
we went our separate ways—she to the campanile, Ito the
Morris chair. © mi m« simimao
