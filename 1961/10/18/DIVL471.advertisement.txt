Today
we painted
some music
It may seem unusual that these young
sters are painting “by ear”... turning
music from the classroom radio into
colorful pictures. But this is the kind
of creativeness the Standard School
Broadcast inspires.
Currently, the program’s theme is
“Music Passport to the World.”
Using our listening guide, teachers
relate music to geography, history,
art. folklore, literature.
This helps children gain insight ink
the life and culture of the peoples
of the world. It leads to better and
quicker understanding of both the
music and the other studies.
By playing and dramatizing all types
of music from symphony to jazz.
Thailand dances to Broadway hits,
the program adds a new, delightful
dimension to learning.
We started this program 33 years
ago, never dreaming our listening
family would grow to include 2 5 d’
million children in classrooms. Now
countless adults, too. have discovered
how entertaining and informative
the broadcasts arc at home.
If you’d like to know why the pro
gram has such wide appeal, trv tuning
in on Thursdays. We think you will
enjoy it, too.
planning ahead to serve you better

Today
we painted
some music
It may seem unusual that these young
sters are painting “by ear”... turning
music from the classroom radio into
colorful pictures. But this is the kind
of creativeness the Standard School
Broadcast inspires.
Currently, the program’s theme is
“Music Passport to the World.”
Using our listening guide, teachers
relate music to geography, history,
art. folklore, literature.
This helps children gain insight ink
the life and culture of the peoples
of the world. It leads to better and
quicker understanding of both the
music and the other studies.
By playing and dramatizing all types
of music from symphony to jazz.
Thailand dances to Broadway hits,
the program adds a new, delightful
dimension to learning.
We started this program 33 years
ago, never dreaming our listening
family would grow to include 2 5 d’
million children in classrooms. Now
countless adults, too. have discovered
how entertaining and informative
the broadcasts arc at home.
If you’d like to know why the pro
gram has such wide appeal, trv tuning

enjoy it, too.
