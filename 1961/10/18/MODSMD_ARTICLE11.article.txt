# Negotiating Time On Berlin Is Here
## 
### 
The heat’s off—for the moment.
The man in the Kremlin yesterday offered to withdraw his de
mand that a peace treaty between Russia and East Germany be
signed before Dec. 31. But, Khrushchev told the 22nd Communist
Party Congress, he would do so only if the West shows a willingness
to negotiate the thorny problem.
\\ bile it is obvious that the Soviet leader has had no change of
heart in his outlook on world events, we still think it is now clear
even for General de Gaulle—that Khrushchev is itching to sign a
treaty, and is willing to negotiate and presumably compromise to
an extent.
No one can yet say how far he is willing to back down on his
Berlin stand—but bis words yesterday certainly constituted backing
away from his previous rocket-rattling statements.
It is to be expected that the Western powers will now put their
foreign ministers’ heads together and come up with a unified bar
gaining position on the Berlin issue. A strong but flexible position
must be agreed upon by the Big Four before they enter talks with
the Russians. This means the general in Paris (and the chancellor
in Bonn) will have to realize that the time for negotiating has
arrived, after too long an absence.
In the Kremlin yesterday, Khrushchev reiterated his call for a
“free demilitarized West Berlin.” He also expects the West to rea
lize—if it hasn’t by now-that be really does intend to sign a treaty
with Ulbricht.
Obviously, the West must make up its mind if it can accept
such conditions and still guarantee that the light of freedom in West
Berlin will not slowly fade out.
We hope the position of the West is as flexible as President Ken
nedy told the United Nations it is. “Standing firm in Berlin” just
to stand firm might well be standing the world up to the nuclear
firing wall.
It appears that the West will be forced to recognize East Ger
many, no matter how distasteful this is, in order to work out a
settlement of the situation. By now the West should realize that
is far more preferable than continuing the current war of nerves
and chances for an atomic Armageddon.

to negotiate the thorny problem.
\\ bile it is obvious that the Soviet leader has had no change of
heart in his outlook on world events, we still think it is now clear
even for General de Gaulle—that Khrushchev is itching to sign a
treaty, and is willing to negotiate and presumably compromise to
an extent.
No one can yet say how far he is willing to back down on his
Berlin stand—but bis words yesterday certainly constituted backing
away from his previous rocket-rattling statements.
It is to be expected that the Western powers will now put their
foreign ministers’ heads together and come up with a unified bar
gaining position on the Berlin issue. A strong but flexible position
must be agreed upon by the Big Four before they enter talks with
the Russians. This means the general in Paris (and the chancellor
in Bonn) will have to realize that the time for negotiating has
arrived, after too long an absence.
In the Kremlin yesterday, Khrushchev reiterated his call for a
“free demilitarized West Berlin.” He also expects the West to rea
lize—if it hasn’t by now-that be really does intend to sign a treaty
with Ulbricht.
Obviously, the West must make up its mind if it can accept
such conditions and still guarantee that the light of freedom in West
Berlin will not slowly fade out.
We hope the position of the West is as flexible as President Ken
nedy told the United Nations it is. “Standing firm in Berlin” just
to stand firm might well be standing the world up to the nuclear
firing wall.
It appears that the West will be forced to recognize East Ger
many, no matter how distasteful this is, in order to work out a
settlement of the situation. By now the West should realize that
is far more preferable than continuing the current war of nerves
and chances for an atomic Armageddon.
