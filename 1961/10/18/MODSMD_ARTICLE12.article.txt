# STAFF OPINION
## Anti-Communist Rally Could Become 'Threat' 
### DECRER DAVIS 
In a land harboring 180,000,000
souls varied jn intelligence, re
ligious convictions, ethnic back
ground and gullibility, it can hard
ly be surprising that the lunatic
fringe may often exhibit itself
as colorfully as a Steward plaid.
Probably never before, however,
has it had the official sanction of
a three-hour, six-state television
coverage, the sponsorship of a
formerly well-regarded oil com
pany and the endorsement of two
members of the United States
Congress and the publisher of
Life, all in one fell swoop.
This happened with the cover
age Monday night of the Los An
geles Anti-Communism Rally, a
monstrosity born of the wedding
of a revivalist spirit and a semi
fascist assumption of national in
fallibility.
AMONG THE more odoriferous
bits of verbal garbage spewed
into the ranks of the loyal 23,000
at Hollywood Bowl, was Senator
Thomas Dodd’s magnificently un
equivocal statement that “There
is nothing good about Commun
ism ... It is total evil, it is all
black.”
Even those who follow closely
the annual folly of congressional
action should be somewhat
amazed and not a little apprehen
sive that such monumental stu
pidity can exist on what should bo
such an exalted plane.
I say stupidity, rather than ig
norance, since Senator Dodd as
sures us all that he has had ample
access to the “facts” of Commun
ist activity.
ON THE points whore Senator
Dodd failed, Representative Wal
ter Judd was able to provide
graphic answers.
Dodd gave no real indication as
to what action we might take.
(Indeed, the only logical conse
quences of this picture of a civili

zation beset by the Ultimate Evil
would be either immediate launch
ing of every atomic warhead at
our disposal in the general direc
tion of the Soviet sector of the
world, or retreat into a mental
cocoon, waiting for the inevita
ble.)
Judd’s proposal, offered with
obvious and genuine pride, was
that we should starve the people
of the Communist lands. But that
sounds mean.
ACTUALLY IT is beneficient,
for once we have put "a 100 per
cent embargo” on all food into
Communist countries, they will
immediately arise against their
oppressor and run to the free
world for aids to their material
welfare.
Exactly why they should feel
attracted to a system which had
deliberately starved great masses
of its population is unclear.
For comic relief, we were given
Dr. Fred Schwartz, president of
the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade, a small Australian who
might have been a kangaroo in
some previous incarnation.
COMIC, that is, until you no
ticed that his hand gestures, fran
tic speaking methods and obvious
lack of logical ability in his ha
rangues to the masses lie so close
to those of Hitler’s early days that
the comparison is staggering.
If he is not yet as effective as
that Noble Nazi, wo must realize
that he has not yet had proper
practice. The coming national
tour of the Anti-Communist Cru
sade’s form of organized insanity
should provide it.
George Lincoln Rockwell is im
possible. The John Birch Society
is improbable. The Anti-Commun
ist Rally has already happened.
If open opposition is not immedi
ately shown, it could easily be
come the greatest threat this for
tunately even-keeled country has
yet been subjected to.

monstrosity born of the wedding
of a revivalist spirit and a semi
fascist assumption of national in
fallibility.
AMONG THE more odoriferous
bits of verbal garbage spewed
into the ranks of the loyal 23,000
at Hollywood Bowl, was Senator
Thomas Dodd’s magnificently un
equivocal statement that “There
is nothing good about Commun
ism ... It is total evil, it is all
black.”
Even those who follow closely
the annual folly of congressional
action should be somewhat
amazed and not a little apprehen
sive that such monumental stu
pidity can exist on what should bo
such an exalted plane.
I say stupidity, rather than ig
norance, since Senator Dodd as
sures us all that he has had ample
access to the “facts” of Commun
ist activity.
ON THE points whore Senator
Dodd failed, Representative Wal
ter Judd was able to provide
graphic answers.
Dodd gave no real indication as
to what action we might take.
(Indeed, the only logical conse
quences of this picture of a civili

zation beset by the Ultimate Evil
would be either immediate launch
ing of every atomic warhead at
our disposal in the general direc
tion of the Soviet sector of the
world, or retreat into a mental
cocoon, waiting for the inevita
ble.)
Judd’s proposal, offered with
obvious and genuine pride, was
that we should starve the people
of the Communist lands. But that
sounds mean.
ACTUALLY IT is beneficient,
for once we have put "a 100 per
cent embargo” on all food into
Communist countries, they will
immediately arise against their
oppressor and run to the free
world for aids to their material
welfare.
Exactly why they should feel
attracted to a system which had
deliberately starved great masses
of its population is unclear.
For comic relief, we were given
Dr. Fred Schwartz, president of
the Christian Anti-Communist
Crusade, a small Australian who
might have been a kangaroo in
some previous incarnation.
COMIC, that is, until you no
ticed that his hand gestures, fran
tic speaking methods and obvious
lack of logical ability in his ha
rangues to the masses lie so close
to those of Hitler’s early days that
the comparison is staggering.
If he is not yet as effective as
that Noble Nazi, wo must realize
that he has not yet had proper
practice. The coming national
tour of the Anti-Communist Cru
sade’s form of organized insanity
should provide it.
George Lincoln Rockwell is im
possible. The John Birch Society
is improbable. The Anti-Commun
ist Rally has already happened.
If open opposition is not immedi
ately shown, it could easily be
come the greatest threat this for
tunately even-keeled country has
yet been subjected to.
In a land harboring 180,000,000
souls varied jn intelligence, re
ligious convictions, ethnic back
ground and gullibility, it can hard
ly be surprising that the lunatic
fringe may often exhibit itself
as colorfully as a Steward plaid.
Probably never before, however,
has it had the official sanction of
a three-hour, six-state television
coverage, the sponsorship of a
formerly well-regarded oil com
pany and the endorsement of two
members of the United States
Congress and the publisher of
Life, all in one fell swoop.
This happened with the cover
age Monday night of the Los An
