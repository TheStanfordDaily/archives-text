# Soviet 50-Megaton Bomb To Be Man's Biggest Blast
## 
### JOSEPH L. MYLER United Press International 
WASHINGTON Nikita S.
Khrushchev in effect yesterday
promised the world the biggest
dose of radioactive fallout ever
generated by a single series of
nuclear weapons tests.

He did it when ho announced
the Russians would conclude
their 1961 tests at the end of this
month with the detonation of a
50-megaton bomb equal in power
to 50 million tons of TNT.

This would be by far the big
gest bang ever set off by man.
In one flash it would release 25
times more sheer energy than all
the bombs dropped by the U.S.
Air Force on Germany and Japan
in World War 11.
KHRUSHCHEV’ said the Rus
sians have a 100-megaton bomb
but had decided not to explode it
“because we might then blow in
our windows.” He was speaking
at the time to the 22nd Commu
nist Party Congress in Moscow.
If Khrushchev intended this as
a generous gesture to the w T orld,
atomic experts here wore not im
pressed by it. The “usefulness” of
nuclear weapons, from a military
standpoint, is not increased in
direct proportion to their power.
Piling megaton upon megaton,
as all nuclear powers are techni
cally able to do, does not greatly
extend the range of destruction
by blast. It does expand—though
not in direct proportion to power
—the area in which atomic heat
will start fires and sear human
beings.
DR. RALPH E. Lapp, an au
thority on atomic weapons, said
of Khrushchev’s announcement
that as a destroyer of civilians
a 30-megaton bomb “would be
nearly as bad” as an “anti-popu
lation” 100-megaton weapon.
But from the military stand
point of ability to knock out
buried missile bases and other
“hard targets,” neither of these
monsters would be any better
than a few properly placed 10-
megaton bombs, Lapp said.
Dr. Lester Machta, the Weath
er Bureau’s authority on fallout
patterns, said the Russians would
have to detonate a 50-megaton
device at great altitude to keep
it from drenching Soviet terri
tory with deadly early fallout.
THIS, he said, would keep the
50-megatoner’s radioactive prod
ucts suspended in the high atmo
sphere longer than usual and
spread it ultimately over large

areas of both hemispheres.
Machta estimates that a 50-
megaton giant would have to be
exploded so high in the upper at

mosphere that its radioactive de
bris might stay up for more than
a year. About half of this would
come down on the Southern Hem
isphere, he says.
Some rough calculations sup
plied by official sources show
why the experts see little military
gain from multiplying megaton
nages, A 10-megaton bomb would
destroy all but the strongest re
inforced concrete structures to a
distance of 1.06 miles from the
explosion.
A 50-megaton bomb would ex
tend this nearly total destruction
range to 2.75 miles and a 100-meg
atoner to 3.75 miles. The home
destruction range would be 8.3
miles for 10 megatons, 14 for 50,
and 17.5 for 100 megatons.
TIIK MILITARY experts feel
on the basis of these figures that
a few 10-megaton weapons would
be more effective, cheaper, and
easier to put on target than the
heavier and bulkier bigger bombs.

A 50-megaton bomb would ex

WASHINGTON Nikita S.
Khrushchev in effect yesterday
promised the world the biggest
dose of radioactive fallout ever
generated by a single series of
nuclear weapons tests.

He did it when ho announced
the Russians would conclude
their 1961 tests at the end of this
month with the detonation of a
50-megaton bomb equal in power
to 50 million tons of TNT.

This would be by far the big
gest bang ever set off by man.
In one flash it would release 25
times more sheer energy than all
the bombs dropped by the U.S.
Air Force on Germany and Japan
in World War 11.
KHRUSHCHEV’ said the Rus
sians have a 100-megaton bomb
but had decided not to explode it
“because we might then blow in
our windows.” He was speaking
at the time to the 22nd Commu
nist Party Congress in Moscow.
If Khrushchev intended this as
a generous gesture to the w T orld,
atomic experts here wore not im
pressed by it. The “usefulness” of
nuclear weapons, from a military
standpoint, is not increased in
direct proportion to their power.
Piling megaton upon megaton,
as all nuclear powers are techni
cally able to do, does not greatly
extend the range of destruction
by blast. It does expand—though
not in direct proportion to power
—the area in which atomic heat
will start fires and sear human
beings.
DR. RALPH E. Lapp, an au
thority on atomic weapons, said
of Khrushchev’s announcement
that as a destroyer of civilians
a 30-megaton bomb “would be
nearly as bad” as an “anti-popu
lation” 100-megaton weapon.
But from the military stand
point of ability to knock out
buried missile bases and other
“hard targets,” neither of these
monsters would be any better
than a few properly placed 10-
megaton bombs, Lapp said.
Dr. Lester Machta, the Weath
er Bureau’s authority on fallout
patterns, said the Russians would
have to detonate a 50-megaton
device at great altitude to keep
it from drenching Soviet terri
tory with deadly early fallout.
THIS, he said, would keep the
50-megatoner’s radioactive prod
ucts suspended in the high atmo
sphere longer than usual and
spread it ultimately over large

areas of both hemispheres.
