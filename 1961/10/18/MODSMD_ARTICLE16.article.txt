HY HARRY FERGUSON

Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev has been doing his home
work. He has learned a lesson
taught by one of the wisest men
communism ever produce d
Lenin, the prophet and engineer
of the Bolshevist revolution.
When the hai’d facts of life
mad<? it pocejsspry for Lenin to
make an abrupt change in the
party line, he explained it this
way:
“The advance of communism
consists of taking two steps for
ward and one step back.”
KHRUSHCHEV took a step
back yesterday in his speech to
the Soviet party congress in Mos
cow. He lifted the deadline on the
signing of a separate peace treaty
with East Germany. In public, he
ate many of the fiery words ho
has boon uttering for the last six
months. His deadline was Dec. 31,
1961, and it was a day that prob
ably disturbed the sound sleep of
Western statesmen.
A separate peace treaty with
East Germany would contain the
seeds of World War 111. It could
develop into a situation where the
Western powers would have to
fight to safeguard their rights in
Berlin.
ON THE surface this appears
to be a tremendous concession on
the part of Moscow, but it would
be dangerous to assume that
Khrushchev suddenly has gone
soft on the Berlin issue. He tied
some conditions to his abandon
ment of the Dec. 31 deadline.
There must be, he said, quick
negotiations on the German prob
lem.
Here is where the trouble is
likely to start. President Kenne
dy told Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko that he was “of
fering an apple for an orchard,”
and the West is unlikely to go
into any conference unless an
apple is offered for an apple.
KHRUSHCHEV, like Lenin, is
an able propaganda man and in
the early stages of his speech
yestei'day he was wearing the
mask of a peacemaker. It was a
subtle job. He knows as well as
anybody that the West is divided
on how, when and what to nego
tiate, and that French President
Charles de Gaulle is at the mo
ment dragging his feet. So if
there are no negotiations, whose
fault is it? Not Khrushchev’s.

Soviet Premier Nikita Khru
shchev has been doing his home
work. He has learned a lesson
taught by one of the wisest men
communism ever produce d
Lenin, the prophet and engineer
of the Bolshevist revolution.
When the hai’d facts of life
mad<? it pocejsspry for Lenin to
make an abrupt change in the
party line, he explained it this
way:
“The advance of communism
consists of taking two steps for
ward and one step back.”
KHRUSHCHEV took a step
back yesterday in his speech to
the Soviet party congress in Mos
cow. He lifted the deadline on the
signing of a separate peace treaty
with East Germany. In public, he
ate many of the fiery words ho
has boon uttering for the last six
months. His deadline was Dec. 31,
1961, and it was a day that prob
ably disturbed the sound sleep of
Western statesmen.
A separate peace treaty with
East Germany would contain the
seeds of World War 111. It could
develop into a situation where the
Western powers would have to
fight to safeguard their rights in
Berlin.
ON THE surface this appears
to be a tremendous concession on
the part of Moscow, but it would
be dangerous to assume that
Khrushchev suddenly has gone
soft on the Berlin issue. He tied
some conditions to his abandon
ment of the Dec. 31 deadline.
There must be, he said, quick
negotiations on the German prob
lem.
Here is where the trouble is
likely to start. President Kenne
dy told Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko that he was “of
fering an apple for an orchard,”
and the West is unlikely to go
into any conference unless an
apple is offered for an apple.
KHRUSHCHEV, like Lenin, is
an able propaganda man and in
the early stages of his speech
yestei'day he was wearing the
mask of a peacemaker. It was a
subtle job. He knows as well as
anybody that the West is divided
on how, when and what to nego
tiate, and that French President
Charles de Gaulle is at the mo
ment dragging his feet. So if
there are no negotiations, whose
fault is it? Not Khrushchev’s.
