BONN (UPD— Aging Chancel
lor Konrad Adenauer announced
yesterday he will retire before the
end of the next four-year legisla
tive period.
Adenauer, 85, disclosed his in
tention just before parliament
opened a new session and thus
assured his re-election by the
Bundestag lower house to a fourth
term as chancellor.
Adenauer has served as chan
cellor since 1949, when the first
West German government was
formed. It appeared his likely suc
cessor would be Economics Minis
ter and Vice Chancellor Ludwig
Erhard.
The chancellor’s Christian Dem

17 elections. It since has negoti
ated a coalition with the balance
of-power Free Democrats.
Free Democratic party leader
Erich Monde has said he will join
Adenauer in a coalition provided
the chancellor agreed to step
down after a set time.
