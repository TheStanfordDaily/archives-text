# Walter Lippmann Act Two in Berlin
## 
### 
We are at the beginning of Act
Two of the Berlin crisis. The West
ern allies must try to find a ne
gotiating position on which they
can agree. It will not he easy to do
this. For in West Germany, in
Franco, and in this country there
are powerful and passionate op
ponents of any negotiations. They
believe that any negotiation must
involve concessions on the part of
the West without any correspond
ing concessions by the Soviet
Union.

To make one-sided concessions
will, they insist, undermine and
destroy the Western alliance, and
cause the whole structure of the
anti-Communist world to collapse.
It is quite possible that the in
transigents will prevail in the
sense that Bonn and Paris will be
able for the present to impose a
veto upon Washington and Lon
don. The German press is crying
out that President Kennedy is
preparing to betray Germany, and
the West German Foreign Minis
ter has made it known that in the
view of his government there are
no negotiable points.
OVER ALL this there hangs the
threat that if there is a negoti
ated settlement, the West cannot
be sure of the West German com
mitment to the Western alliance.
The real issue, it is being said in
high quarters, is not about West
Berlin but about West Germany,
No doubt, these hysterical cries
about betrayal must not be taken
too grimly and too literally. For
the Germans are in a state of
shock. For the first time after
years of soft promises and self
deception they have to face the
realities of the partition of Ger
many.
What they are crying out for
now is that we must refuse to ne
gotiate about anything so that
they may go on for a while longer
to dream that as a leading mem
ber of the Western alliance they
will eventually liberate and ab
sorb Eastern Germany.
IT MAY BE that by going to the
brink of thermonuclear war we
can gain some time for the West
Germans to turn over in bed and
have another nap. Nobody can
know what are the odds on ther
monuclear war if there is no ne
gotiation. But they may well be
50-50 or a little better, that even
if we refuse to negotiate, Khrush
chev will not make a warlike
move such as interfering physi
cally with existing access routes.
Quite possibly, he may not be
ready or willing to play Russian
roulette in Berlin. Those who want
to gamble with stakes which are
infinitely large have a hunch—it
it no more than a hunch—that the
pistol is not loaded.
Their hunch could be right. It
is possible that Khrushchev would
draw away from war even if we
refuse to negotiate with him. But
where the intransigents cannot be
right is in the notion, which is at
the heart of the matter, that if
nothing about Berlin is changed
by negotiation, nothing will be
changed about Berlin.
THIS IS THE radical fallacy of
the so-called hard-boiled school.
They do not realize that the status
quo in West Berlin has already
been changed radically by the ac
tion of Aug. 13, when the wall
was raised.

By standing firm and refusing
to negotiate they cannot go back
to the situation which existed be
fore Aug. 13. West Berlin has now
ceased to be what it was in the
Adenauer era, the symbol of Ger
man reunification under the aegis
of the Bonn government. It has
ceased to be a show window to
East Germany of the affluence
and freedom of West Germany.
It has ceased to be a fulcrum
for the liberation of East Ger
many. Unless some kind of future
for this half-city is provided by
negotiation, West Berlin will be a
derelict ship which is running out
of fuel and has lost its rudder.
THAT IS WHY it is untrue to
say that in a negotiation about
West Berlin we can only lose and
can have nothing to gain.
Those who say this do not real
ize what happened to West Berlin
on Aug. 13, and they imagine that
West Berlin is still what it was
in the best days of the Adenauer-
Dulles partnership. The truth is
that West Berlin today is a
stricken city without a future,
and to negotiate is not to sur
render what we have but to bar
gain for much that is necessary
and that we do not have. What
we do not have is a viable future
for West Berlin.
We cannot have a viable future
for West Berlin unless we can

negotiate a contractual agreement
with the Soviet Union. If we can
negotiate it, which is by no means
certain today, it will not be a sur
render. It will be the achievement
of something which will be a good
deal better than what exists to
day and may be a good deal bet
ter than what existed before Aug.
13.

IF A successful negotiation can
be carried out, the West Germans
must cease to cry out that any ne
gotiation will be a betrayal on our
part, and to accompany it with an
overtone of threat that this might
release them morally and politi
cally from their allegiance to the
West. We are not betraying the
Germans and, despite the hysteri
cal talk, we must continue to have
confidence that the Germans will
reciprocate.

gotiating position on which they
can agree. It will not he easy to do
this. For in West Germany, in
Franco, and in this country there
are powerful and passionate op
ponents of any negotiations. They
believe that any negotiation must
involve concessions on the part of
the West without any correspond
ing concessions by the Soviet
Union.

To make one-sided concessions
will, they insist, undermine and
destroy the Western alliance, and
cause the whole structure of the
anti-Communist world to collapse.
It is quite possible that the in
transigents will prevail in the
sense that Bonn and Paris will be
able for the present to impose a
veto upon Washington and Lon
don. The German press is crying
out that President Kennedy is
preparing to betray Germany, and
the West German Foreign Minis
ter has made it known that in the
view of his government there are
no negotiable points.
OVER ALL this there hangs the
threat that if there is a negoti
ated settlement, the West cannot
be sure of the West German com
mitment to the Western alliance.
The real issue, it is being said in
high quarters, is not about West
Berlin but about West Germany,
No doubt, these hysterical cries
about betrayal must not be taken
too grimly and too literally. For
the Germans are in a state of
shock. For the first time after
years of soft promises and self
deception they have to face the
realities of the partition of Ger
many.
What they are crying out for
now is that we must refuse to ne
gotiate about anything so that
they may go on for a while longer
to dream that as a leading mem
ber of the Western alliance they
will eventually liberate and ab
sorb Eastern Germany.
IT MAY BE that by going to the
brink of thermonuclear war we
can gain some time for the West
Germans to turn over in bed and
have another nap. Nobody can
know what are the odds on ther
monuclear war if there is no ne
gotiation. But they may well be
50-50 or a little better, that even
if we refuse to negotiate, Khrush
chev will not make a warlike
move such as interfering physi
cally with existing access routes.
Quite possibly, he may not be
ready or willing to play Russian
roulette in Berlin. Those who want
to gamble with stakes which are
infinitely large have a hunch—it
it no more than a hunch—that the
pistol is not loaded.
Their hunch could be right. It
is possible that Khrushchev would
draw away from war even if we
refuse to negotiate with him. But
where the intransigents cannot be
right is in the notion, which is at
the heart of the matter, that if
nothing about Berlin is changed
by negotiation, nothing will be
changed about Berlin.
THIS IS THE radical fallacy of
the so-called hard-boiled school.
They do not realize that the status
quo in West Berlin has already
been changed radically by the ac
tion of Aug. 13, when the wall
was raised.

By standing firm and refusing
to negotiate they cannot go back
to the situation which existed be
fore Aug. 13. West Berlin has now
ceased to be what it was in the
Adenauer era, the symbol of Ger
man reunification under the aegis
of the Bonn government. It has
ceased to be a show window to
East Germany of the affluence
and freedom of West Germany.
It has ceased to be a fulcrum
for the liberation of East Ger
many. Unless some kind of future
for this half-city is provided by
negotiation, West Berlin will be a
derelict ship which is running out
of fuel and has lost its rudder.
THAT IS WHY it is untrue to
say that in a negotiation about
West Berlin we can only lose and
can have nothing to gain.
Those who say this do not real
ize what happened to West Berlin
on Aug. 13, and they imagine that
West Berlin is still what it was
in the best days of the Adenauer-
Dulles partnership. The truth is
that West Berlin today is a
stricken city without a future,
and to negotiate is not to sur
render what we have but to bar
gain for much that is necessary
and that we do not have. What
we do not have is a viable future
for West Berlin.
We cannot have a viable future
for West Berlin unless we can

negotiate a contractual agreement
with the Soviet Union. If we can
negotiate it, which is by no means
certain today, it will not be a sur
render. It will be the achievement
of something which will be a good
deal better than what exists to
day and may be a good deal bet
ter than what existed before Aug.
13.

IF A successful negotiation can
be carried out, the West Germans
must cease to cry out that any ne
gotiation will be a betrayal on our
part, and to accompany it with an
overtone of threat that this might
release them morally and politi
cally from their allegiance to the
West. We are not betraying the
Germans and, despite the hysteri
cal talk, we must continue to have
confidence that the Germans will
reciprocate.

Franco, and in this country there
are powerful and passionate op
ponents of any negotiations. They
believe that any negotiation must
involve concessions on the part of
the West without any correspond
ing concessions by the Soviet
Union.

To make one-sided concessions
will, they insist, undermine and
destroy the Western alliance, and
cause the whole structure of the
anti-Communist world to collapse.
It is quite possible that the in
transigents will prevail in the
sense that Bonn and Paris will be
able for the present to impose a
veto upon Washington and Lon
don. The German press is crying
out that President Kennedy is
preparing to betray Germany, and
the West German Foreign Minis
ter has made it known that in the
view of his government there are
no negotiable points.
OVER ALL this there hangs the
threat that if there is a negoti
ated settlement, the West cannot
be sure of the West German com
mitment to the Western alliance.
The real issue, it is being said in
high quarters, is not about West
Berlin but about West Germany,
No doubt, these hysterical cries
about betrayal must not be taken
too grimly and too literally. For
the Germans are in a state of
shock. For the first time after
years of soft promises and self
deception they have to face the
realities of the partition of Ger
many.
What they are crying out for
now is that we must refuse to ne
gotiate about anything so that
they may go on for a while longer
to dream that as a leading mem
ber of the Western alliance they
will eventually liberate and ab
sorb Eastern Germany.
IT MAY BE that by going to the
brink of thermonuclear war we
can gain some time for the West
Germans to turn over in bed and
have another nap. Nobody can
know what are the odds on ther
monuclear war if there is no ne
gotiation. But they may well be
50-50 or a little better, that even
if we refuse to negotiate, Khrush
chev will not make a warlike
move such as interfering physi
cally with existing access routes.
Quite possibly, he may not be
ready or willing to play Russian
roulette in Berlin. Those who want
to gamble with stakes which are
infinitely large have a hunch—it
it no more than a hunch—that the
pistol is not loaded.
Their hunch could be right. It
is possible that Khrushchev would
draw away from war even if we
refuse to negotiate with him. But
where the intransigents cannot be
right is in the notion, which is at
the heart of the matter, that if
nothing about Berlin is changed
by negotiation, nothing will be
changed about Berlin.
THIS IS THE radical fallacy of
the so-called hard-boiled school.
They do not realize that the status
quo in West Berlin has already
been changed radically by the ac
tion of Aug. 13, when the wall
was raised.

By standing firm and refusing
to negotiate they cannot go back
to the situation which existed be
fore Aug. 13. West Berlin has now
ceased to be what it was in the
Adenauer era, the symbol of Ger
man reunification under the aegis
of the Bonn government. It has
ceased to be a show window to
East Germany of the affluence
and freedom of West Germany.
It has ceased to be a fulcrum
for the liberation of East Ger
many. Unless some kind of future
for this half-city is provided by
negotiation, West Berlin will be a
derelict ship which is running out
of fuel and has lost its rudder.
THAT IS WHY it is untrue to
say that in a negotiation about
West Berlin we can only lose and
can have nothing to gain.
Those who say this do not real
ize what happened to West Berlin
on Aug. 13, and they imagine that
West Berlin is still what it was
in the best days of the Adenauer-
Dulles partnership. The truth is
that West Berlin today is a
stricken city without a future,
and to negotiate is not to sur
render what we have but to bar
gain for much that is necessary
and that we do not have. What
we do not have is a viable future
for West Berlin.
We cannot have a viable future
for West Berlin unless we can

negotiate a contractual agreement
with the Soviet Union. If we can
negotiate it, which is by no means
certain today, it will not be a sur
render. It will be the achievement
of something which will be a good
deal better than what exists to
day and may be a good deal bet
ter than what existed before Aug.
13.

IF A successful negotiation can
be carried out, the West Germans
must cease to cry out that any ne
gotiation will be a betrayal on our
part, and to accompany it with an
overtone of threat that this might
release them morally and politi
cally from their allegiance to the
West. We are not betraying the
Germans and, despite the hysteri
cal talk, we must continue to have
confidence that the Germans will
reciprocate.
