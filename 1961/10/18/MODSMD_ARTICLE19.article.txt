## De Gaulle Proceeds In Algeria 
### PAUL EVE 
PARIS (UPI) —When someone
started shooting in Bizerte last
summer, it triggered off more
than just a row between Tunisia
and France.
It began the end of “Bourguiba
ism”—the idea fostered by Pres
ident Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia
that the North African nations
should remain linked with France.
It sent Bourguiba sliding off
towards the Arab nations and lat
er produced a reshuffle of the Al
gerian rebel government to which
Bourguiba has played host in re
cent years and with which Presi
dent de Gaulle has been trying to
reach agreement on the future of
an independent Algeria.
DE GAULLE was reported
ready to drop any idea of further
negotiations with the rebels and
go it alone in Algeria when the
Tunisian - based government
quaked and brought up a new
man at its head.
Out went Ferhat Abbas, the
one-time pharmacist who was re
garded as too moderate and too
much inclined to the idea of Bour
guibaism.
In came tough young Youssef
Ben Khedda, 39, against Abbas’
61 years, a die-hard rebel whereas
Abbas was more of a liberal.
AND OUT, according to the best
informed speculation, also went
any chance of resumption on the
Franco-Algerian talks that began
at Evian-Les Bains and sputtered
along for a few weeks there and
at nearby Lugrin.
Now the chances are that the
rebels under their new leadership
will heat up the Algeria war and,
since Ben Khedda is friendly with
the Communist world, there could
be more aid from behind the Iron
Curtain.
But this is hardly likely to
bother De Gaulle, who spelled out
last year and early this year what
would happen to Algeria.
IF THE REBEL regime would
not agree to an independent Al
geria associated with France, he
indicated France would go it
alone in setting up the independ
ent new state.
Now it looks as if that is what
will happen.
The chances are that where last
January saw a referendum to ask
the French and Algerian peoples
whether they approved De
Gaulle’s plans for Algeria, next
January may see the first refer
endum in Algeria to ask the peo
ple there whether they want inde
pendence or to remain tied to
France.

indicated France would go it
alone in setting up the independ
ent new state.
Now it looks as if that is what
will happen.
The chances are that where last
January saw a referendum to ask
the French and Algerian peoples
whether they approved De
Gaulle’s plans for Algeria, next
January may see the first refer
endum in Algeria to ask the peo
ple there whether they want inde
pendence or to remain tied to
France.
PARIS (UPI) —When someone
started shooting in Bizerte last
summer, it triggered off more
than just a row between Tunisia
and France.
It began the end of “Bourguiba
ism”—the idea fostered by Pres
ident Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia
that the North African nations
should remain linked with France.
It sent Bourguiba sliding off
towards the Arab nations and lat
er produced a reshuffle of the Al
gerian rebel government to which
Bourguiba has played host in re
cent years and with which Presi
dent de Gaulle has been trying to
reach agreement on the future of
an independent Algeria.
DE GAULLE was reported
ready to drop any idea of further
negotiations with the rebels and
go it alone in Algeria when the
Tunisian - based government
quaked and brought up a new
man at its head.
Out went Ferhat Abbas, the
one-time pharmacist who was re
garded as too moderate and too
much inclined to the idea of Bour
guibaism.
In came tough young Youssef
Ben Khedda, 39, against Abbas’
61 years, a die-hard rebel whereas
Abbas was more of a liberal.
AND OUT, according to the best
informed speculation, also went
any chance of resumption on the
Franco-Algerian talks that began
at Evian-Les Bains and sputtered
along for a few weeks there and
at nearby Lugrin.
Now the chances are that the
rebels under their new leadership
will heat up the Algeria war and,
since Ben Khedda is friendly with
the Communist world, there could
be more aid from behind the Iron
Curtain.
But this is hardly likely to
bother De Gaulle, who spelled out
last year and early this year what
would happen to Algeria.
IF THE REBEL regime would
not agree to an independent Al
geria associated with France, he
indicated France would go it
alone in setting up the independ
ent new state.
