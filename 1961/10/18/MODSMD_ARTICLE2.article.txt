# DANGER ON CAMPUS
## Quad Gates May Close To Cyclists, Says Davis 
### 
Inconsiderate and irresponsible
bicyclists are creating a danger
on campus and will probably
force locking of the gate across
from the main library, according
to Police Chief Gordon Davis.
Bicyclists have been allowed to
ride through the gate across the
center of Quad to the physics lec
ture hall, but this convenience
will probably be revoked by the
University Traffic Committee,
now studying the campus bicycle
problem, when it meets, Davis
said,
DAVIS pointed out that bikes
are not otherwise allowed on
Quad; they must be parked out
side the collonades or in bike

racks back of the church. They
may not be ridden under the col
lonades, he said.
Davis called on students to use
consideration and safety in riding
their bikes, emphasizing that
bikes come under exactly the
same traffic regulations as cars
and can be given tickets for their
violation. These regulations in
clude riding on the right side of
the street, giving hand signals,
stopping at all stop signs and
keeping clear of cross walks.
DAVIS noted other rules ap
plicable to bicycles:
• Bicycles must never be rid
den on sidewalks. Cyclists should
use bicycle paths where they have
been specially provided, as along
Palm Drive.

• Bikes ridden at night must
have a headlight and either a
taillight or red reflector. Inex
pensive bike lights are available
at the Bookstore and are easily
installed. If it gets dark while a
person is out on a bike that has
no light, he should walk his bike
home.

• Bikes should be parked in
racks or on their own stands in
areas adjacent to racks.
