# STAFF OPINION
## Increasing Federal Aid Necessary 
### BARKY GREENBERG Associate Editor 
Many Americans are worrying
about the increasing role the fed
eral government is playing in our
economy. They fear “creeping so
cialism” and the eventual destruc
tion of our free enterprise system,
or what economists call the price
market system.
These persons fail to realize an
important point: there is over
whelming evidence pointing to the
need for increased federal activity
in relation to our economic growth
rate. In the August issue of The
Atlantic, Edward T. Chase, a
writer on public affairs and a con
sultant to private industry and to
the government, discusses some
of this evidence.

His viewpoint rests on two basic
forces: (It our demographic
change, which includes population
growth, a change of age complex
ion of the American population,
and the great movement to urban
and suburban centers; (2) techno
logical progress.
ALSO CENTRAL to Chase’s ar
gument is the concept that “a
stepped up economic growth rate
alone, while desirable and even
essential, is an incomplete solu
tion” to a whole series of econom
ic problems.

For instance there is the prob
lem of medical care for the aged.
Technology has given medicine
the means to control the death
rate and thus make persons over
65 the nation’s fastest growing
population group. At the same
time, technology has made in
dustry so productive as to elimi
nate the aged as an essential part
of our work force. Only few can
earn even minimal incomes.

Most of the elderly are largely
unprotected by health insurance.
What has this situation to do with
the question of growth and pri
vate versus public spending?
Chase says, “This much is clear: a
rise in the economic growth rate
by itself is beside the work.
“THOUGH economic growth is
necessary for many reasons, we
are learning that growth in a
modern society also can be dis
mayingly irrelevant . . . The
bulk of the elderly lack the finan
cial means to afford the health in
surance they desperately require;
whereas the insurance industry,
operating in the market system,
cannot hope to insure the aged at
premium rates on which the com
panies can break even, let alone
make a profit, for the rates are
set by the costs of medical care in
the first place.”
What we therefore witness “is
the spreading phenomenon that
goes to the root of the growth de
bate: the incapability of the price
market system, for technical rea
sons beyond its purview, to supply
an essential public need.” The only
recourse is government support,
given the “strapped financial sit
uation of the states.”
ANOTHER area in which feder
al assistance is needed is urban
slum clearance. According to
Chase, an increase in our econom
ic growth rate, even up to five per
cent annually, would matter preci
ous little.

Evidence shows that mere de
mand does not register in the very
costly task of rebuilding cities.
“Only the most hidebound con
servative would contend in 1961
that we should leave the survival
of our cities up to the vagaries of
market values.’’

Medical care for the aged and
urban slum clearance are only two
of the many economic problems
which the price-market system, be
cause of technical reasons, is un
able to solve.
Consequently, control of the
economy is becoming a govern
ment concern, not because of sub
versive or ideological considera
tions, but because the impersonal
forces of technology and demog
raphy are requiring it.

Atlantic, Edward T. Chase, a
writer on public affairs and a con
sultant to private industry and to
the government, discusses some
of this evidence.

His viewpoint rests on two basic
forces: (It our demographic
change, which includes population
growth, a change of age complex
ion of the American population,
and the great movement to urban
and suburban centers; (2) techno
logical progress.
ALSO CENTRAL to Chase’s ar
gument is the concept that “a
stepped up economic growth rate
alone, while desirable and even
essential, is an incomplete solu
tion” to a whole series of econom
ic problems.

For instance there is the prob
lem of medical care for the aged.
Technology has given medicine
the means to control the death
rate and thus make persons over
65 the nation’s fastest growing
population group. At the same
time, technology has made in
dustry so productive as to elimi
nate the aged as an essential part
of our work force. Only few can
earn even minimal incomes.

Most of the elderly are largely
unprotected by health insurance.
What has this situation to do with
the question of growth and pri
vate versus public spending?
Chase says, “This much is clear: a
rise in the economic growth rate
by itself is beside the work.
“THOUGH economic growth is
necessary for many reasons, we
are learning that growth in a
modern society also can be dis
mayingly irrelevant . . . The
bulk of the elderly lack the finan
cial means to afford the health in
surance they desperately require;
whereas the insurance industry,
operating in the market system,
cannot hope to insure the aged at
premium rates on which the com
panies can break even, let alone
make a profit, for the rates are
set by the costs of medical care in
the first place.”
What we therefore witness “is
the spreading phenomenon that
goes to the root of the growth de
bate: the incapability of the price
market system, for technical rea
sons beyond its purview, to supply
an essential public need.” The only
recourse is government support,
given the “strapped financial sit
uation of the states.”
ANOTHER area in which feder
al assistance is needed is urban
slum clearance. According to
Chase, an increase in our econom
ic growth rate, even up to five per
cent annually, would matter preci
ous little.

Evidence shows that mere de
mand does not register in the very
costly task of rebuilding cities.
“Only the most hidebound con
servative would contend in 1961
that we should leave the survival
of our cities up to the vagaries of
market values.’’

Medical care for the aged and
urban slum clearance are only two
of the many economic problems
which the price-market system, be
cause of technical reasons, is un
able to solve.
Consequently, control of the
economy is becoming a govern
ment concern, not because of sub
versive or ideological considera
tions, but because the impersonal
forces of technology and demog
raphy are requiring it.
Many Americans are worrying
about the increasing role the fed
eral government is playing in our
economy. They fear “creeping so
cialism” and the eventual destruc
tion of our free enterprise system,
or what economists call the price
market system.
These persons fail to realize an
important point: there is over
whelming evidence pointing to the
need for increased federal activity
in relation to our economic growth
rate. In the August issue of The
Atlantic, Edward T. Chase, a
writer on public affairs and a con
sultant to private industry and to
