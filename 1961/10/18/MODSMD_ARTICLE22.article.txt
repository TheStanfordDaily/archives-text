# East Germans Crash Barrier To W. Berlin
## 
### 
BERLIN (UPD— Three East
Germans rode a truck covered
with do-it-yourself armor plating
through a hail of Communist suh
machinegun fire yesterday and
crashed their way to freedom
through border barricades into
West Berlin.
The four-ton truck, with steel
plates built around the driver’s
cab, splintered two road barriers
and sped past the Communists’
checkpoint on the main route to
West Berlin.
SURPRISED Communist
guards fired 15 sub-machinegun
rounds. But the refugees aged
18 to 22 —escaped unwounded,
West Berlin police said.
The dramatic scape highlighted
a series of new border incidents.
Two West Berlin policemen were
injured by tear gas grenades
hurled by Communist police.
The West Berlin (policemen
were struck by two of a barrage
of nearly 20 tear gas grenades
thrown into West Berlin during
the day by Communist patrols.
Both police were struck in the
face.

A WOMAN watching television
in her West Berlin apartment
narrowly escaped injury when a
Communist bullet whizzed
through her window. West Berlin
police said there was no apparent
reason for the shooting.
In Cherbourg, France, another
1,100 American troops joining the
U.S. military buildup in West
Germany arrived aboard a mili
tary transport ship.
