ROUSSELOT DEBATE
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Van Buren, in his letter of
Oct. 16, states that Prof. John
Bunzel “ . . . apparently did not
have anything worth saying . . . ”
at the Rousselot speech . . . Fri
day: nor did he have anything to
add to the discussion except
"wild hypothetical generaliza
tions.”
. . . Bunzel made several con
structive points. He charged . . .
the Birch Society views the world
as primarily conspiratorial; . . .
they regard most everything with
which they disagree as being the

result of Communist activity:

they believe Communists to be at
the heart of all events which op
pose the U.S.
Rousselot himself offers the
proof for these statements. In the
course of his speech, he made sev
eral assertions:

1.) That Communists in the
U.S. are a hard core; . . . they
undermine our structure by hav
ing other people do their bidding.
2.) That the Communist aim is
world domination. 3.) That social
ism is the logical precursor to
Communism (Leninist style).

By applying these assertions,
. . . Rousselot condemns all for
eign aid to countries which are
socialist or have socialist tenden
cies; yet he supports foreign aid
to Fascist Spain.
He can also condemn any social
or political move . . . within this
country by branding it socialist
or Communist inspired. . . .
. . . Bunzel also pointed out the
Principle of Reversal, which he
quoted from the Blue Book. . . .

Simply stated, it implies that the
Communists may come out in fa
vor of things which they are se
cretly against so that the U.S.
will openly oppose them and . . .
accomplish the Communist cause.
Like the Freudian principle of Re
versal, this allows the Birch . . .
member to explain away any
move or motive as Communist.
None of these ideas in them
selves is without foundation or
supporting evidence. However,
Mr. Rousselot and the Birch Soci
ety grind these into a system
which allows them the fantastic
extreme of distorting the happen
ings of the entire world and
branding as treacherous any per
son, organization, or ideal which
goes against their philosophy.
Stephen Jon .Morris
Editor, Tin* Daily:
Mr. Van Buren’s “shock and out
rage” at the actions of Prof. Bun
zel last Friday is surely misplaced.
If the discussion of the Birch So
ciety was not always on a high in

tellectual level, it was because Mr.
Rousselot chose to bring it down
to the juvenile level by evasive
ness, unsupported statements, and
worst of all, by insulting the in
telligence of his audience.

Perhaps the only legitimate
charge against Prof. Bunzel was
his failure to identify which quo
tations came from the Black Book
and which from the Blue Book.
Mr. Rousselot objected on the
grounds that Mr. Welch’s private
beliefs (the Black Book) arc ir
relevant. This is an odd position
for Mr. Rousselot to take, for it is
a part of the Birchist dogma that
the private beliefs of any politi
cal, church or labor leaders are
within the proper jurisdiction of
Birchist inquiry.
Finally, I would like to apply
the Birchist “principle of revers
al” to Mr. Rousselot himself.

The “funny little fat man in the
Kremlin” has attacked the Birch
Society and its members. May wo
not therefore assume that Mr. K.
really supports the Birch Society
as a tool by which to weaken
America by dividing it against it
self?

PACIFISM
Editor, The Daily:
Recently my pacifist leanings
have crystallized into a definite
stand. I see that there is away out
of the present, intolerable world
situation, and that there is a peace
ful method of conducting inter
national relations.

I would like to present my stand
briefly here in the hope that it
will show, by contrast, the irra
tionality of the status quo and the
graveness of the danger inherent
in the Conservative foreign policy
position—which is essentially that
America comes first, humanity
second.

First, I make the value judg
ment that the existence of hu

inanity is infinitely more impor
tant than the existence of Ameri
ca as a nation or even the exist
ence of the ideals of liberty which
America claims to protect.
If you take issue with this, ex
plain to me how America can ex
ist if human civilization no longer
exists. Both possibilities loom dan
gerously near.
Preceding logically from this
value judgment I conclude that
our government must unilaterally
disarm—gradually perhaps, to al
low our war economy to adjust
to the novel idea of peace, but in
evitably.
Our policy in Germany must in
the future be based on a concern
for what is good for all the human
beings involved, in other words,
for all humanity, rather than on
shallow self-interest. Make Berlin
a neutral city, move the U.N. head
quarters there.
Khrushchev himself has spoken
favorably of such a plan. Our U.N.
policy must likewise be guided by
humanitarian rather than nation
alistic goals.
In the world today we can no
longer act as if we were proud
nations struggling for supremacy;
we must act rather as individu
als in a world society.
Nuclear annihilation, either as
the result of mechanical failure or

of human folly is a definite possi
bility within this decade. Pieserv
ing the arms balance can lead to
no progress toward peace.
Increasing the arms stockpile is
ludicrous. Unilateral disarma
ment is a gamble but presents, at
least, some chance for survival.
Let us therefore put first things
first; and the very first consider
ation is obviously the preserva
tion of humanity.

tellectual level, it was because Mr.

charge against Prof. Bunzel was
his failure to identify which quo

Mr. Rousselot objected on the

Recently my pacifist leanings
have crystallized into a definite
stand. I see that there is away out
of the present, intolerable world
situation, and that there is a peace
ful method of conducting inter
national relations.

I would like to present my stand
briefly here in the hope that it
will show, by contrast, the irra
tionality of the status quo and the
graveness of the danger inherent
in the Conservative foreign policy
position—which is essentially that
America comes first, humanity
second.

First, I make the value judg
ment that the existence of hu

inanity is infinitely more impor
tant than the existence of Ameri
ca as a nation or even the exist
ence of the ideals of liberty which
America claims to protect.
If you take issue with this, ex
plain to me how America can ex
ist if human civilization no longer
exists. Both possibilities loom dan
gerously near.
Preceding logically from this
value judgment I conclude that
our government must unilaterally
disarm—gradually perhaps, to al
low our war economy to adjust
to the novel idea of peace, but in
evitably.
Our policy in Germany must in
the future be based on a concern
for what is good for all the human
beings involved, in other words,
for all humanity, rather than on
shallow self-interest. Make Berlin
a neutral city, move the U.N. head
quarters there.
Khrushchev himself has spoken
favorably of such a plan. Our U.N.
policy must likewise be guided by
humanitarian rather than nation
alistic goals.
In the world today we can no
longer act as if we were proud
nations struggling for supremacy;
we must act rather as individu
als in a world society.
Nuclear annihilation, either as
the result of mechanical failure or

of human folly is a definite possi
bility within this decade. Pieserv
ing the arms balance can lead to
no progress toward peace.
Increasing the arms stockpile is
ludicrous. Unilateral disarma
ment is a gamble but presents, at
least, some chance for survival.
Let us therefore put first things
first; and the very first consider
ation is obviously the preserva

Mr. Van Buren, in his letter of
Oct. 16, states that Prof. John
Bunzel “ . . . apparently did not
have anything worth saying . . . ”
at the Rousselot speech . . . Fri
day: nor did he have anything to
add to the discussion except
"wild hypothetical generaliza
tions.”
. . . Bunzel made several con
structive points. He charged . . .
the Birch Society views the world
as primarily conspiratorial; . . .
they regard most everything with
which they disagree as being the

result of Communist activity:

they believe Communists to be at
the heart of all events which op
pose the U.S.
Rousselot himself offers the
proof for these statements. In the
course of his speech, he made sev
eral assertions:

1.) That Communists in the
U.S. are a hard core; . . . they
undermine our structure by hav
ing other people do their bidding.
2.) That the Communist aim is
world domination. 3.) That social
ism is the logical precursor to
Communism (Leninist style).

By applying these assertions,
. . . Rousselot condemns all for
eign aid to countries which are
socialist or have socialist tenden
cies; yet he supports foreign aid
to Fascist Spain.
He can also condemn any social
or political move . . . within this
country by branding it socialist
or Communist inspired. . . .
. . . Bunzel also pointed out the
Principle of Reversal, which he
quoted from the Blue Book. . . .

Simply stated, it implies that the
Communists may come out in fa
vor of things which they are se
cretly against so that the U.S.
will openly oppose them and . . .
accomplish the Communist cause.
Like the Freudian principle of Re
versal, this allows the Birch . . .
member to explain away any
move or motive as Communist.
None of these ideas in them
selves is without foundation or
supporting evidence. However,
Mr. Rousselot and the Birch Soci
ety grind these into a system
which allows them the fantastic
extreme of distorting the happen
ings of the entire world and
branding as treacherous any per

ROUSSELOT DEBATE
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Van Buren, in his letter of
Oct. 16, states that Prof. John
Bunzel “ . . . apparently did not
have anything worth saying . . . ”
at the Rousselot speech . . . Fri
day: nor did he have anything to
add to the discussion except
"wild hypothetical generaliza
tions.”
. . . Bunzel made several con
structive points. He charged . . .
the Birch Society views the world
as primarily conspiratorial; . . .
they regard most everything with
which they disagree as being the

result of Communist activity:

they believe Communists to be at
the heart of all events which op
pose the U.S.
Rousselot himself offers the
proof for these statements. In the
course of his speech, he made sev
eral assertions:

1.) That Communists in the
U.S. are a hard core; . . . they
undermine our structure by hav
ing other people do their bidding.
2.) That the Communist aim is
world domination. 3.) That social
ism is the logical precursor to
Communism (Leninist style).

By applying these assertions,
. . . Rousselot condemns all for
eign aid to countries which are
socialist or have socialist tenden
cies; yet he supports foreign aid
to Fascist Spain.
He can also condemn any social
or political move . . . within this
country by branding it socialist
or Communist inspired. . . .
. . . Bunzel also pointed out the
Principle of Reversal, which he
quoted from the Blue Book. . . .

Simply stated, it implies that the
Communists may come out in fa
vor of things which they are se
cretly against so that the U.S.
will openly oppose them and . . .
accomplish the Communist cause.
Like the Freudian principle of Re
versal, this allows the Birch . . .
member to explain away any
move or motive as Communist.
None of these ideas in them
selves is without foundation or
supporting evidence. However,
Mr. Rousselot and the Birch Soci
ety grind these into a system
which allows them the fantastic
extreme of distorting the happen
ings of the entire world and
branding as treacherous any per
son, organization, or ideal which
goes against their philosophy.

Mr. Van Buren’s “shock and out
rage” at the actions of Prof. Bun
zel last Friday is surely misplaced.
If the discussion of the Birch So
ciety was not always on a high in

tellectual level, it was because Mr.
Rousselot chose to bring it down
to the juvenile level by evasive
ness, unsupported statements, and
worst of all, by insulting the in
telligence of his audience.

Perhaps the only legitimate
charge against Prof. Bunzel was
his failure to identify which quo
tations came from the Black Book
and which from the Blue Book.
Mr. Rousselot objected on the
grounds that Mr. Welch’s private
beliefs (the Black Book) arc ir
relevant. This is an odd position
for Mr. Rousselot to take, for it is
a part of the Birchist dogma that
the private beliefs of any politi
cal, church or labor leaders are
within the proper jurisdiction of
Birchist inquiry.
Finally, I would like to apply
the Birchist “principle of revers
al” to Mr. Rousselot himself.

The “funny little fat man in the
Kremlin” has attacked the Birch
Society and its members. May wo
not therefore assume that Mr. K.
really supports the Birch Society
as a tool by which to weaken
America by dividing it against it
self?

If you take issue with this, ex

Preceding logically from this

Our policy in Germany must in

accomplish the Communist cause.
Like the Freudian principle of Re
versal, this allows the Birch . . .
member to explain away any
move or motive as Communist.
None of these ideas in them
selves is without foundation or
supporting evidence. However,
Mr. Rousselot and the Birch Soci
ety grind these into a system
which allows them the fantastic
extreme of distorting the happen
ings of the entire world and
branding as treacherous any per
son, organization, or ideal which
goes against their philosophy.

Editor, Tin* Daily:
Mr. Van Buren’s “shock and out
rage” at the actions of Prof. Bun
zel last Friday is surely misplaced.
If the discussion of the Birch So
ciety was not always on a high in

tellectual level, it was because Mr.
Rousselot chose to bring it down
to the juvenile level by evasive
ness, unsupported statements, and
worst of all, by insulting the in
telligence of his audience.

Perhaps the only legitimate
charge against Prof. Bunzel was
his failure to identify which quo
tations came from the Black Book
and which from the Blue Book.
Mr. Rousselot objected on the
grounds that Mr. Welch’s private
beliefs (the Black Book) arc ir
relevant. This is an odd position
for Mr. Rousselot to take, for it is
a part of the Birchist dogma that
the private beliefs of any politi
cal, church or labor leaders are
within the proper jurisdiction of
Birchist inquiry.
Finally, I would like to apply
the Birchist “principle of revers
al” to Mr. Rousselot himself.

The “funny little fat man in the
Kremlin” has attacked the Birch
Society and its members. May wo
not therefore assume that Mr. K.
really supports the Birch Society
as a tool by which to weaken
America by dividing it against it
self?

PACIFISM
Editor, The Daily:
Recently my pacifist leanings
have crystallized into a definite
stand. I see that there is away out
of the present, intolerable world
situation, and that there is a peace
ful method of conducting inter
national relations.

I would like to present my stand
briefly here in the hope that it
will show, by contrast, the irra
tionality of the status quo and the
graveness of the danger inherent
in the Conservative foreign policy
position—which is essentially that
America comes first, humanity
second.

First, I make the value judg
ment that the existence of hu

inanity is infinitely more impor
tant than the existence of Ameri
ca as a nation or even the exist
ence of the ideals of liberty which
America claims to protect.
If you take issue with this, ex
plain to me how America can ex
ist if human civilization no longer
exists. Both possibilities loom dan
gerously near.
Preceding logically from this
value judgment I conclude that
our government must unilaterally
disarm—gradually perhaps, to al
low our war economy to adjust
to the novel idea of peace, but in
evitably.
Our policy in Germany must in
the future be based on a concern
for what is good for all the human
beings involved, in other words,
for all humanity, rather than on
shallow self-interest. Make Berlin
a neutral city, move the U.N. head
quarters there.
Khrushchev himself has spoken
favorably of such a plan. Our U.N.
policy must likewise be guided by
humanitarian rather than nation
alistic goals.
In the world today we can no
longer act as if we were proud
nations struggling for supremacy;
we must act rather as individu
als in a world society.
Nuclear annihilation, either as
the result of mechanical failure or

of human folly is a definite possi
bility within this decade. Pieserv
ing the arms balance can lead to
no progress toward peace.
Increasing the arms stockpile is
ludicrous. Unilateral disarma
ment is a gamble but presents, at
least, some chance for survival.
Let us therefore put first things
first; and the very first consider
ation is obviously the preserva
tion of humanity.
