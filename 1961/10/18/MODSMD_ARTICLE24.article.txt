# European Reaction to 'K' Mixed
## 
### 
LONDON (UPl)—British For
eign Secretary Lord Home said
yesterday he was “encouraged” by
Russia’s relaxation of the year
end deadline for signing a Ger
man peace treaty. Other West
European governments gave Pre
mier Nikita S. Khrushchev’s
speech a mixed reception.
A West German government
spokesman said it was “nothing
new.”
Semi-official French reaction
was that the Soviet, leader now
prefers negotiations to win his ob
jectives.
SPOKESMEN IN all three ma
jor European capitals noted the
Soviet “peace” offer was accom
panied by the awesome announce
ment that Russia is to explode a
50-megaton hydrogen bomb.
A diplomatic assessment of
Khrushchev’s Berlin move termed
it a “climbdown,” ostensibly due
to Western firmness in the face
of Russian threats.
The assessment said there was
no indication of any major modi
fication of Russia’s terms for a
Berlin accord. The Soviet leader
significantly called for a “free de
militarized Berlin” which implies
Western withdrawal from the
city, the assessment said.
The Soviet move at once set off
fresh expectations of East-West
negotiations later this year.
BRITAIN recalled her ambassa
dor in Moscow Sir Frank Roberts
for urgent consultation.
Lord Privy Seal Edward Heath
announced at the same time in
the House of Commons that it
should be possible to reach agree
ment “if Mr. Khrushchev is pre
pared to respect the true freedom
of West Berlin, the rights of its
people and the rights of his for
mer allies.”
Official sources indicated Allied
consultations would be speeded,
in a fresh effort to align Western
policy on how to approach negoti
ations with the Russians.
