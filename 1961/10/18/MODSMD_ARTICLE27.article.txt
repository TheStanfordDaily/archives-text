TOKYO (UPI) Communist
North Viet Nam yesterday ac
cused the United States of “inter
vention" in South Viet Nam and
demanded the immediate with
drawal of all American military
personnel and equipment from the
country.
The Communist demand came
while President Kennedy’s special
military adviser, Gen. Maxwell
D. Taylor, was flying to South
Viet Nam to survey the situation
and recommend measures to cope
with the increasing Red menace
there. He is expected to arrive in
Saigon today after a brief stop
over in the Philippines.
North Vietnamese foreign min
ister Ung Van Khiem registered
the propaganda-laden protest with

Britain and Russia, co-chairmen
of the 1954 Geneva Conference on
Indochina. Text of the note was
carried in part by Communist ra
dio Hanoi and monitored in Tokyo.
It demanded "the U.S. govern
ment stop its intervention in
South Viet Nam.”
