# Huskies Still Strong Despite 21-14 Loss to Golden Bears
## Daily Sports 
### BEN TIPTON 
Washington’s Huskies still de
serve respect, even if they did lose
to Cal.
Still exulting over his squad’s
21-14 victory last week, Cal coach
Marv Levy said he “figured Wash
ington as perhaps the best loam
in tiie conference before the sea
son started.”
They may still be. The Bears’
win came via a blocked punt on
the Husky 17-yard line with 3:08
remaining in the game, and mav

rate as the biggest upset of the
AAWU season.
IiVIOING this Saturday’s Wash
ington-Stanford clash in Seattle,
Card coach Jack Curtice rated any
hypothetical Washington weak
nesses as “beyond their second
string.” The facts back him up;

on paper at least, the Huskies
are a very strong team.
Bulwarking a heavy, aggressive
line is Jim Skaggs, a 6-2, 215-
pound senior guard. Veteran of
two Rose Bowl victories, the only
returning starter from last year’s
Husky squad, and the best all
round player on the team, he is as
solid an All-America candidate as
can be found on the West Coast.
Junior center Ray Mansfield, at
220 pounds, combines with Skaggs
to give the Huskies a solid interi
or line. The Northerners are at
least two deep at both tackles with
Rod Scheyer < 2 HI) and John Mey
ers (240) backed up by Jake
Kupp (200) and Jon Knoll (230).
TIIE ENDS are the weakest
spots in the Husky lino with only
one letterman junior Andy Alkire,
returning. Skaggs and Meyers,
both veteran ends, were moved to
interior lino positions to fill posts
vacated through graduation.
Halfback Charlie Mitchell, a
185-pound breakaway throat, led
the Huskies in rushing last year
as a sophomore, averaging 6.3
yards on each of 74 carries. He
was kept out of the Cal game by
an injury, but may be back to
harass the Stanford defense.
Halfback Martin Wyatt and
fullback Jim Stiger took up some
of the slack left by Mitchell’s ab
sence last Saturday. The\ rushed
for 75 and 61 yards respectively
against the Bears, easily outpac
ing the defending hacks.
Another highly regarded run
ning hack is Bob Monroe, a 180-
pound junior who was ninth in
total rushing on lasi ; 's Wash
ington squad.

calling duties with Pete Older for
the Huskies. Jorgensen, a 195-
pound senior, rates as a powerful
running threat. Ohler has been
rated a brilliant passer, but was
off against the Bears, completing
only one of ten and suffering two
interceptions.
Washington came* out of last
week’s debacle with nothing in
jured but the Husky pride. Gun
ning for the Indians at full
strength, with the possible ex
