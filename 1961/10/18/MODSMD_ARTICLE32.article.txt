# A 						SPORTING PROPOSITION
## 
### Ken Dery 
Sophomore Studded

The outstanding performances turned in by sophomores in last
weekend's football game with San Jose State give one on interesting
look into the future. Things certainly look better than (hey did just
one year ago when San Jose's Spartans ripped the Cards 34-20.
The expression ‘sophomore-studded’ was used almost every day
in the spring and early fall press releases in reference to this year’s
Stanford football team. The expression has always seemed to carry a
somewhat hesitant, somewhat degrading connotation as to what one
could expect of the performances of sophomores under pressure. So
far this season it has been the stunning performances of the young
sters which has pushed Cactus Jack’s men to a 3-1 record. Last cam
paign the team went 0-10.
STEVE TIICJKEOW, the 6-2 L', 200-pound quarterback, ran (he

option with a confidence one sel
rom sees in a quarterback. When
Thurlow sees daylight ho wants
it. Running, to this husky guy, is
not just a facet of self preserva
tion. Although Coach Curtice says
that he will still rotate his three
quarterbacks, it seems just a mat
ter of time until the 19-year-old
Thurlow takes over.
Picture this: Frank Atkinson
starts his first varsity game at
tackle and is voted the outstand
ing lineman on the coast for his
crushing job against Tulane. Then
last week -‘- Frank Patitucci got
tlie call because- junior regular
Steve Pursell had a bad foot. All
Patitucci did was recover a fum
ble to set up a touchdown and in
tercept a pass to kill a Spartan
drive. He was voted ‘Northern
California lineman of the week’
and he deserved the honor.

Injuries Forced Youngsters into Action

It was thought that the loss of halfback Larry Roy.se and full
back Hal Steuber via injuries might possibly throw the machine out
of whack, for as Jack Curtice has said, ‘‘ln the backfield we’re almost
as thin as my hair.” The sophomores have picked up the slack.
DON'T GUT MK wrong. The sophs haven’t done it all, hut they
have made t he- difference.
The list is as long as your arm: Ken Babajian, but 5-8 and 188
pounds, has no fear of piledriving into the line from his fullback
slot. Danny Spence, a halfback, has shown that he can run if given
a little air. Mike Barnes, outstanding against Tulane, is a fine com
petitor and likes the rugged going.
Up front Frank Dubofsky and A1 Hildebrand have been doing a
quiet, but efficient job. Guard Dubofsky goes to the post at 6-2H,
220 while tackle Hildebrand is 6-5 and 239. Chris Jessen and Chuck
McCormick have snared a couple at end and don’t seem to hurt the
attack any when they are in there.
AND DON'T forget the little scafhack Tyce Fit/morris. Tyce
won’t knock anybody down, hut if he can get past the end on a
sweep look out.
