# ARRIVING FROM NIGERIA
## Corps Girl to Come Home 
### 
FOXBORO, Mass. (UPD—Peace Corps volun
teer Margery Michelmore, whose postcard to a
friend created a diplomatic uproar in Nigeria, told
her parents yesterday via transatlantic telephone
she was coming home.
A report from Judith Houtz, a former Stanford
student also at University College, Ibadan, is ex
pected at The Daily shortly.
Miss Houtz, a senior in political science, is
studying in Nigeria in conjunction with a program
of the HR’s African Desk.
Mrs. Michelmore said, “Our first concern When
we talked to Margery yesterday morning was to
find out if she was all right.
“MARGERY told us she was being sen) home
for a while but didn’t know exactly when or where
she would arrive,” her mother said, adding she
“thinks” her daughter will arrive tomorrow.
“The situation is seriously delicate now,” Mrs.
Michelmore said. “Margery left here three weeks
ago with the intention of teaching and nothing
else.”

Howard Michelmore said earlier he believes his
daughter is the victim of a frameup,
HE SAID Margery “had a job done on her
she isn't the kind of girl to drop her mail around.
I believe the incident was prearranged and she was
the victim.”

Miss Michelmore, 23, wrote a postcard to a
friend in the United States describing the “squalor

and absolutely primitive living conditions” in Ni
geria.
Miss Michelmore’s postcard was intercepted, re
produced and distributed among Nigerian students
at the university in Ibadan whore she was in train
ing for services as a school teacher here.
THE students demonstrated and demanded the
expulsion of the entire 40-momber Peace Corps
contingent.
Reports from Ibadan yesterday said the stu
dents who circulated the copies will be "disci
plined.” There was no elaboration.
A government spokesman said that while it was
“perfectly right that the students . . . should be in
censed and indignant, the views expressed are not
■shared hy other members of the Peace Corps.”
“The friendly and cordial relations between Ni
geria and the U.5.A.,” he said, “must not be jeopard
ized or affected by the foolish writings of one ir
responsible student.”
THE university’s Student Christian Movement
also urged the student body “not to be hostile” to
Peace Corps members who are studying for volun
teer services throughout Nigeria.
“Miss Michelmore must not be taken as the
voice of America,” the movement said. “It is the sin
of an individual person, and is a symptom of racial
sin which dictates the attitude of the white races
of the world toward the black races.”
Newspapers also called for calm and restraint.
