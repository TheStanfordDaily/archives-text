# JFK to Nik: 'Don't Do It'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The
White House last night called up
on Soviet Premier Nikita Khrush
chev not to go through with his
announced plan to explode a 50-

megaton nuclear bomb. It said
such a detonation could only serve
“some unconfessed political pur
pose.”

A statement handed io hastily
summoned reporters said the
United States believed peoples all
over the world would join the
plea. It said this country has had
the technical know-how to make
a 50 to 100-megaton bomb since
1957 but saw no military necessity
for such monster weapons.

THE STATEMENT said a 50-
megaton explosion larger than
any yet set off by man—could
serve no legitimate purpose. It
said the blast would add “a mass”
of additional radioactive fallout to
the nuclear debris created by the
20 Soviet shots announced since
Sept. 1.
Khrushchev told the 22nd Com
munist Party Congress in Mos
cow yesterday that Russia would
conclude its current test series
late this month with a 50-megaton
blast- -equal to the force of 50 mil
lion tons of TNT.

“We call upon the Soviet Union
to reconsider this decision, if in
fact it has been made,” the White
House said.

PRESIDENT Kennedy previous
ly has denounced any 100-megaton
Soviet bomb as a terror weapon
designed to blackmail the West
into softening its stand on cold
war issues.

A 50-megaton detonation would
bo the largest known man-made
explosion in history and would
mean that the current Russian
test series would dump more ra
dioactive fallout on mankind than
any previous series.

“We know about high-yield
weapons,” the White House said.
“But we also know that such
weapons are not essential to our
military needs.”

PRESIDENT Kennedy, mean
while, was reported to be “serious
ly concerned” that Allied differ
ences on Berlin strategy had been
blown out of proportion. Aides
said the President believed the
recent cancellation of allied strat
egy talks in London was a mere
tempest in a teapot and that too
much dire significance hud been
read into it.
