# Kornberg Describes Gene's Role
## 
### BILL REPPY 
Through clever analogies which
reduced an extremely complex
subject into laymen’s terms, last
night’s Tuesday evening series
audience which packed Dinkel
spiel Auditorium took a brief but
enlightening course in biochem
istry.
The instructor was Stanford’s
reknowned biochemist, microbi
ologist and Nobel Prize winner,
Arthur Kornberg.

If the members of the audi
ence learned little of practical
value, they gained a new respect
for science and admiration for
Kornberg’s speaking ability.
The key to inheritance, the
gene, he pictured as a micro
scopic encyclopedia of thousands
of volumes of information. Its
alphabet is of four letters, repre
senting four characteristic mole
cular compositions.
The encyclopedia takes the
shape of a long, twisting stair
case composed of DNA (deoxyri
bonucleic acid), the substance
Kornberg helped to discover. The
many thousand cross-ties on this
ladder are two-letter words com
posed of the four letters in the
alphabet.

These sub-microscopic struc
tures, he explained, control all
the subtle detail in the develop
ment of an organism. Just one
misspelling, that is, an incorrect
substance appearing on one of
billions of cross-ties in a chromo
some, can result in a fatal illness,
such as sickle-cell anemia.

The work of regulating cell
growth is done by proteins, built
on a 20-letter alphabet comprised
of amino acids. Ribonucleic acid,
RNA, is the decoder from the
DNA. alphabet to the protein
alphabet.
Duplication or reproduction of
DNA strands during cell repro
duction is achieved by complet
ing with molecular letters the
words (cross-ties) that are split
when the ladder is cut in half.

As study aids Kornberg used
slides, diagrams and a scale
model of part of a DNA stair
case, magnified about 2 million
times.

Genes are actually so minute,
he said, that the chemical formu
las for every living man on earth
could be condensed to a point
smaller than the tip of a pin.
Without Kornberg’s analogies
the audience might have been
totally bewildered by references
to pneumococci, myoglobin, ade
nine, cytosine, bacteriophage,
double helixes, pigeon livers and
guanine.

Kornberg said knowledge of
the chemical basis of heredity has
been discovered only in the last
few years through the combined
efforts of several biochemists,
geneticists and microbiologists.
“Practical rewards in the un
derstanding of disease will inevi
tably follow continued study in
this field,” he said.

Through clever analogies which
reduced an extremely complex
subject into laymen’s terms, last
night’s Tuesday evening series
audience which packed Dinkel
spiel Auditorium took a brief but
enlightening course in biochem
istry.
The instructor was Stanford’s
reknowned biochemist, microbi
ologist and Nobel Prize winner,
Arthur Kornberg.

If the members of the audi
ence learned little of practical
value, they gained a new respect
for science and admiration for
Kornberg’s speaking ability.
The key to inheritance, the
gene, he pictured as a micro
scopic encyclopedia of thousands
of volumes of information. Its
alphabet is of four letters, repre
senting four characteristic mole
cular compositions.
The encyclopedia takes the
shape of a long, twisting stair
case composed of DNA (deoxyri
bonucleic acid), the substance
Kornberg helped to discover. The
many thousand cross-ties on this
ladder are two-letter words com
posed of the four letters in the
alphabet.

These sub-microscopic struc
tures, he explained, control all
the subtle detail in the develop
ment of an organism. Just one
misspelling, that is, an incorrect
substance appearing on one of
billions of cross-ties in a chromo
some, can result in a fatal illness,
such as sickle-cell anemia.

The work of regulating cell
growth is done by proteins, built
on a 20-letter alphabet comprised
of amino acids. Ribonucleic acid,
RNA, is the decoder from the
DNA. alphabet to the protein
alphabet.
Duplication or reproduction of
DNA strands during cell repro
duction is achieved by complet
ing with molecular letters the
words (cross-ties) that are split
when the ladder is cut in half.

As study aids Kornberg used
slides, diagrams and a scale
model of part of a DNA stair
case, magnified about 2 million
times.

Genes are actually so minute,
he said, that the chemical formu
las for every living man on earth
could be condensed to a point
smaller than the tip of a pin.
Without Kornberg’s analogies
the audience might have been
totally bewildered by references
to pneumococci, myoglobin, ade
nine, cytosine, bacteriophage,
double helixes, pigeon livers and
guanine.

Kornberg said knowledge of
the chemical basis of heredity has
been discovered only in the last
few years through the combined
efforts of several biochemists,
geneticists and microbiologists.
“Practical rewards in the un
derstanding of disease will inevi
tably follow continued study in
this field,” he said.
