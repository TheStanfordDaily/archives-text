# Russia Withdraws Deadline On GDR Pact; Asks Talks
## Last Test Bomb—A Big One – To Be Exploded in Two Weeks 
### 
MOSCOW—(UPI)—Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev offered yes
terday to withdraw Iris year-end deadline for a peace treaty with
East Germany on condition the Allies showed “readiness” to nego
tiate. Then he said Russia would explode a 50 megaton bomb—the
biggest in history—on Oct. 30 or 31.

Khrushchev told 4,799 deled
gates to the 22nd Communist
Party Congress in a six hour and
20 minute Kremlin speech that
President Kennedy and other
Western leaders in preliminary
talks appeared ready to settle the
Berlin crisis on a “mutually ac
ceptable basis.”
“IF THE Western powers show
readiness to settle the German
problem,” he said, “. . . then we
shall not insist bn signing of the
peace treaty before Dec. 31, 1961.”
But he repeated his demands for
a “free demilitarized West Ber
lin.”
Khrushchev' said the Soviet
Union would end its nuclear tost
series at the end of the month
by exploding a 50-megaton bomb
—equal to 50 million tons of TNT
and 2,500 times bigger than the
one that incinerated Hiroshima.
He said Russia had perfected
a 100-megaton bomb but “God
grant that we never have to ex
plode it because we might then
blow in our windows.”
THE FIRST world reaction to
Khrushchev’s statements on Ber
lin and Germany was one of ex
tremely cautious optimism.
British Foreign Secretary Lord
Home said he was encouraged.
West Germany said he had said
the same thing before. France ob
served tartly that Krushchev now
apparently prefers negotiations in
order to obtain his objectives.
Khrushchev made only passing
reference to Soviet space achieve
ments but said Russia had an
arsenal of intercontinental mis
siles, anti-aircraft rockets for the
land, sea and air forces, and a
fleet of nuclear submarines
armed with ballistic and homing
rockets.

HE REPEATED his demand
for a three-man “troika” secre
tariat to run the United Nations,
insisted that Communist China
be admitted with two Germanics
—East and West—to repair the
U.N. machinery he said had
grown rusty in the cold war
years and was operating fitfully.

He denounced the Albanian
Communist party, bringing the
Soviet feud with Albania into the
open for the first time, and said
it was trying to draw back into
the Stalin era. He dismissed Yu
goslavia as having been led into
a bog of revisionism by its lead
ers. Neither country was repre
sented at this congress.

President Kennedy and other
Western leaders in preliminary
talks appeared ready to settle the
Berlin crisis on a “mutually ac
ceptable basis.”
“IF THE Western powers show
readiness to settle the German
problem,” he said, “. . . then we
shall not insist bn signing of the
peace treaty before Dec. 31, 1961.”
But he repeated his demands for
a “free demilitarized West Ber
lin.”
Khrushchev' said the Soviet
Union would end its nuclear tost
series at the end of the month
by exploding a 50-megaton bomb
—equal to 50 million tons of TNT
and 2,500 times bigger than the
one that incinerated Hiroshima.
He said Russia had perfected
a 100-megaton bomb but “God
grant that we never have to ex
plode it because we might then
blow in our windows.”
THE FIRST world reaction to
Khrushchev’s statements on Ber
lin and Germany was one of ex
tremely cautious optimism.
British Foreign Secretary Lord
Home said he was encouraged.
West Germany said he had said
the same thing before. France ob
served tartly that Krushchev now
apparently prefers negotiations in
order to obtain his objectives.
Khrushchev made only passing
reference to Soviet space achieve
ments but said Russia had an
arsenal of intercontinental mis
siles, anti-aircraft rockets for the
land, sea and air forces, and a
fleet of nuclear submarines
armed with ballistic and homing
rockets.

HE REPEATED his demand
for a three-man “troika” secre
tariat to run the United Nations,
insisted that Communist China
be admitted with two Germanics
—East and West—to repair the
U.N. machinery he said had
grown rusty in the cold war
years and was operating fitfully.

He denounced the Albanian
Communist party, bringing the
Soviet feud with Albania into the
open for the first time, and said
it was trying to draw back into
the Stalin era. He dismissed Yu
goslavia as having been led into
a bog of revisionism by its lead
ers. Neither country was repre
sented at this congress.
MOSCOW—(UPI)—Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev offered yes
