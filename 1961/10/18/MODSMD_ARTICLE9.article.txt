North County Supervisor Wes
ley L. Hubbard termed Stanford’s
opposition to the proposed $8 mil
lion Ladera Dam “mercenary” as
the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors on Monday and the
San Mateo County Supervisors
yesterday reaffirmed their sup
port for the flood control project
on Stanford property.
Also voting on Monday, the
Board of Directors of the Ladera
Community Association went on
record opposing construction of
the dam.
HUBBARD contended that the
university opposes the dam only
because a large parcel of land,
which otherwise might be devel
oped. will be taken for the federal
project.
Hubbard called Stanford’s al
ternate proposal that the San
Francisquito Creek channel be re
aligned and lined with concrete
“expensive and unsightly.”

The latest endorsement of the
Santa Clara board will be trans
mitted to the U.S. Corps of Army
Engineers which is planning to
hold hearings on the flood con
trol project in Washington Friday.

son to go to Washington, if he
feels it necessary, to testify in
behalf of the project. Wilson
warned the board that support
will be needed in view of the
avowed opposition from Stanford
and Menlo Park officials.

The added opposition of the La
dera Community Association is
based on financial objections.
Their resolution opposed the dam
“in the magnitude and design . . .
presently proposed.”
San Mateo Supervisor T. Louis
Chess suggested Wilson confer
with Santa Clara County and Palo
Alio officials to prepare a joint
presentation in favor of the dam.
The dam project, as proposed,
would occupy 525 acres on Stan
ford property, midway between
Searsville and Felt Lakes.
