# Rusk Sees Reduced Tension
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD Sec
retary of State Dean Rusk said
yesterday that Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev's relaxation of
his deadline for a German peace
treaty “may serve to reduce ten
sions somewhat” in the Berlin
crisis.

But the secretary said Khrush
chev made “little if any” change
in his Berlin demands under
which the West has refused to
negotiate. Consequently, he told a
news conference, it is impossible
to say whether the prospects of
war or peace have changed.
RUSK said even if Berlin talks
between Moscow and the West
could be arranged, there was no
guarantee they would succeed.
However, he said, catastrophe was
the only alternative to keeping
the door open to such negotia
tions.
Rusk spoke as Russia delivered
new notes to the Allies in Mos
cow reaffirming the Kremlin’s
stand that the West can use air
corridors to West Berlin only to
supply its military garrisons. The
United States, France and Brit
ain insist they can use the cor
ridors for whatever traffic they
want.
IN THE FIRST official U.S. re
action to Khrushchev’s speech to
the 22nd Communist Party Con
gress in Moscow Tuesday, Rusk
said he believed the Soviet leader
now understood the firm Western
stand against Russia’s Berlin
threats.
But Rusk would not commit
himself to early East-West ne
gotiations. He said it was vital
to continue exploratory talks to
determine whether there was
room for negotiations.
TURNING to the other key
point in Khrushchev’s speech,
Rusk renewed Tuesday night’s
White House appeal to Russia to
abandon plans to set off a 50-
megaton nuclear bomb late this
month. Rusk said Khrushchev
should consider the world reac
tion that such a blast might touch
off.
On other world issues, Rusk
said:
—He thinks Red China will not
win admission to the United Na
tions this year.
—There is no doubt that con
troversial U.S. aid to Yugoslavia
has helped to keep that Commu
nist country largely independent
of the Soviet bloc.
—THE UNITED STATES is im
patient after four week of hag
gling over a successor to the late
U.N. Secretary General Dag Ham
marskjold. If agreement is not
reached soon, this country may
ask the General Assembly to
name a successor over Russia’s
objections.
—The United States is giving
thorough consideration to Peru’s
call for collective Western Hemis
pheric action against Cuba.
Rusk said the next exploratory
discussions looking toward possi
ble Berlin negotiations would be
carried out by U.S. Ambassador
Llewellyn Thompson in Moscow
and perhaps by other Allied am
bassadors there.
