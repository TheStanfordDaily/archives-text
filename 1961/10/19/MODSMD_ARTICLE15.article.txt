## Khrushchev Attack on Albania Warning to Communist China 
### K. C. THALER United Press International 
LONDON—In his sharp attack
on Albania at the Soviet Party
Congress Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev apparently was de
livering a message to Communist
China.
Soviet experts here interpreted
his remarks as a warning to a
potential rival rather than a mere
dressing down of a small nation
that counts for little in the Com
munist scheme of things.
ONE OF Khrushchev’s listeners
Tuesday was Red Chinese Pre
mier Chou En-lai, who was re
ported to have sat stony-faced
during the attack on the tiny
country that has been a strict fol
lower of the Red Chinese tough
Stalin line.
Khrushchev, in attacking Al

bania for its Stalinist policy went
out of his way also to brand the
cult of personality. Ostensibly di
rected against Albania’s leader
Enver Hoxha, the criticism was
believed intended for Red China’s
supreme loader Mao Tse Tung, a
reputed adherent of the cult of
personality—his own.
KHRUSHCHEV’S attack on Al
bania, moreover, was clearly de
signed as a firm warning that
Moscow and the Kremlin—and in
the last instance Khrushchev per
sonally remain the center of
leadership of international com
munism, with no rival tolerated.
After a close analysis of Khrush
chev’s oratory before the Com
munist Congress the experts here
reached the conclusion that while
Khrushchev is firmly in the saddle
of Soviet leadership he is making
sure that he stays there.
