ANTI COMMUNIST RALLY
Editor, The Daily:
In analyzing last Monday’s Anti-
Communism Rally in Los Angeles,
Daily columnist Derek Davis ap
parently forgets the old proverb
'‘knowledge is power.”
If he would have taken the time
to study the principles and meth
ods of Dr. Fred Schwarz’s Chris
tian Anti-Communism Crusade,
he would have discovered that this
movement is purely educational
and does not seek to influence any
legislation or to “blackball” in
dividuals and organizations not in
agreement with Schwarz’s philos
ophy or methods.
In all CACC material, very few
names are mentioned and domes
tic Communism is treated only as
an arm of the great international
conspiracy.
The Crusade seeks to educate
individual Americans on the evils
of Communism and since most
every American acknowledges
that Communism is an evil, what
is wrong with an attempt to edu

cate?
Mr. Davis’s attack on Senator
Thomas Dodd (D-Conn) is un
founded. I do not see any “monu
mental stupidity” in Dodd’s state
ment that “There is nothing good
about Communism ... It is total
evil, it is all black.”
Dodd did continue his speech
explicitly explaining that America
is not all white, and he expounded
on what action Is needed for our
improvement. I have extensively
studied Communist philosophy
and methods and have yet to find
any good points therein which
would do the United States good
to practice. Perhaps Mr. Davis has
discovered something which I
haven’t seen. If he has, I would
appreciate him not keeping it a
secret. I believe Mr. Davis’s en
ergies are misdirected when he at
tacks functions like the Los An
geles Anti-Communism Rally and
he should start concentrating on
the real threat to our American
way of life—Communism. . . .
