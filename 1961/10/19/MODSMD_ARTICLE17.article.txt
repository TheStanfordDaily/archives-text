## Draft May Hit College Men Before Summer 
### CARL OLIVER Exchange Editor 
One freshman the draft will
never take is Wilbur Wertz, busi
ness administration major at the
University of Washington.
Plis secret?— Eleven grandchil
dren.
Wertz is starting back to school
after nearly 40 years off campus.
On the first day of classes he was
mistaken for a professor.
“As I walked toward the front
of the room,” he told a UW Daily
reporter, “students watched expec
tantly, only to register surprise
as I sat down in a student chair.”
ALTHOUGH “Grandpa” Wertz
feels secure about his civilian
future, other frosh, sophs, juniors
and seniors may have cause for
concern about their draft status.
Col. Daniel Omer, deputy direc
tor of the Selective Service sys
tem, forecasts the drafting by
June of some men presently de
ferred as students.
The current pool of 1,600,000
1-A men over 22 may be exhausted
by then, says Omer, because 60
per cent of the men called up dur
ing the last few months have been
rejected for physical or psycho
logical reasons.
About 60 per cent of the re
jected men are turned down for
receiving low scores on intelli
gence tests. College students are
expected to make higher scores.

SOME COLLEGE students are
already having trouble with mili
tary authority. An investigation
at University of California re

vealed that James L. Creighton
was only one of six students
flunked in ROTC last year for
non-academic reasons.
ROTC officials said Creighton
received an “F” for wearing his
uniform “in a manner considered
improper.”
Another cadet failed for “wear
ing his cap backward and march
ing out of step and with his rifle
out of line.”
Other reasons for failure were
marching in uniform in anti-com
pulsory ROTC picket lines, inso
lent and belligerent action toward
a cadet sergeant, and “goose-step
ping past the reviewing stand and
thumbing his nose.”
THE STUDENTS will have to
repeat the compulsory course to
receive their diplomas from the
university.

San Francisco police arrested
S.F. State College student Joe
Cohen for attempting to hold up a
downtown bank last month.
Cohen was a reporter for the
college paper and editor John
Burks wrote a page one editorial
saying the staff was dumbfounded
at the news.
BURKS described Cohen as “a
quiet, highly moral man with a
subtle sense of humor and a great
deal of personal charm.” And
Burks recalls that Joe wrote a
poem once which he “used to reel
off occasionally with a wry smile.
It may or may not have something
to say about him:
‘Life is a torture rack.
I want my money back.’ ”

SOME COLLEGE students are
already having trouble with mili
tary authority. An investigation
at University of California re

vealed that James L. Creighton
was only one of six students
flunked in ROTC last year for
non-academic reasons.
ROTC officials said Creighton
received an “F” for wearing his
uniform “in a manner considered
improper.”
Another cadet failed for “wear
ing his cap backward and march
ing out of step and with his rifle
out of line.”
Other reasons for failure were
marching in uniform in anti-com
pulsory ROTC picket lines, inso
lent and belligerent action toward
a cadet sergeant, and “goose-step
ping past the reviewing stand and
thumbing his nose.”
THE STUDENTS will have to
repeat the compulsory course to
receive their diplomas from the
university.

San Francisco police arrested
S.F. State College student Joe
Cohen for attempting to hold up a
downtown bank last month.
Cohen was a reporter for the
college paper and editor John
Burks wrote a page one editorial
saying the staff was dumbfounded
at the news.
BURKS described Cohen as “a
quiet, highly moral man with a
subtle sense of humor and a great
deal of personal charm.” And
Burks recalls that Joe wrote a
poem once which he “used to reel
off occasionally with a wry smile.
It may or may not have something
to say about him:
‘Life is a torture rack.
I want my money back.’ ”
One freshman the draft will
never take is Wilbur Wertz, busi
ness administration major at the
University of Washington.
Plis secret?— Eleven grandchil
dren.
Wertz is starting back to school
after nearly 40 years off campus.
On the first day of classes he was
mistaken for a professor.
“As I walked toward the front
of the room,” he told a UW Daily
reporter, “students watched expec
tantly, only to register surprise
as I sat down in a student chair.”
ALTHOUGH “Grandpa” Wertz
feels secure about his civilian
future, other frosh, sophs, juniors
and seniors may have cause for
concern about their draft status.
Col. Daniel Omer, deputy direc
tor of the Selective Service sys
tem, forecasts the drafting by
June of some men presently de
ferred as students.
The current pool of 1,600,000
1-A men over 22 may be exhausted
by then, says Omer, because 60
per cent of the men called up dur
ing the last few months have been
rejected for physical or psycho
logical reasons.
About 60 per cent of the re
jected men are turned down for
receiving low scores on intelli
gence tests. College students are
