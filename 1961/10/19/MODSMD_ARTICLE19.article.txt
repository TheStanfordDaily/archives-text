LUANG PRABANG, Laos (UPI)
—“Neutralist” Prince Souvanna
Phouma yesterday won King Sa
vang Vathana’s permission to
form a new coalition government
with himself as premier provided
all three Laotian factions agree
on the division of cabinet posts.

The king has called for a truly
neutral government that would re
unite his country and put an end
to the long-smoldering civil war
between the Communist-backed
rebels and the pro-Western right
wing forces.
The monarch made known his
wishes in an audience with Sou
vanna, the compromise choice of
the rival princes as premier of the
proposed coalition.
Souvanna, who heads the so
called neutralist faction supported
by the Communist-backed Pathet
Lao, scheduled conferences with
Premier Prince Boun Oum. whose
post he will take over if he suc
ceeds in bringing the feuding fac
tions together in a “government
of national reconciliation.”
Boun Oum and “Red” Prince
Souphanouvong, leader of the
Pathet Lao, have agreed that Sou
vanna should head the coalition
government, but they are far
apart on the composition of the
proposed 16-member cabinet.

It generally was agreed the fac
tions headed by Boun Oum and
Souphanouvong each would get
four posts, while eight would go
to the neutrals. Souvanna wants

his faction to get all eight neutral
seats. Bonn Oum wants four seats
for politicians who are not con
nected with any of the rival fac
tions.
