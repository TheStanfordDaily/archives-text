SERIOUSNESS
Editor, The Daily:
Upon reading a letter to your
paper concerning our ideological
competitors, I was somewhat
taken aback by the aplomb with
which the author suggested that
we grasp the seriousness of the
situation.
Does no one consider the possi
bility that seriousness, perhaps,
does not wish to be grasped? Of
course, it may be pointed out that
in the march of history serious
ness has been grasped many
times and, alas, by many people.
We can point to many, who, in
hours of desperation, by grasping
their weapons with one hand and
seriousness with the other, have
transformed this creature into an
ideological gun-moll.
But does this unfortunate back
ground justify our continuance of
an act which we normally reserve
for last straws? Rather than
grasping seriousness every other
minute, should w 7 e not be trying to
rehabilitate her?

Could wo not sot up a homo for
such creatures as seriousness,
bravery and honor where, after
centuries of service as the tutors
of men’s passions they might in
their turn learn to serve men’s
reason?

Granted, this is very idealistic
in a day when even the devil’s ad
vocate finds it difficult to devise
methods, to deal with those with
whom one disagrees, not already
urged and practiced by the major
ity of men.

Yes, this is, in fact, extremely
idealistic—however, in our world,
idealism, having vacillated for
many centuries between service to
Utopians and the banners of Cru
saders, must finally be viewed
as essential to the coexistence and
survival of all men.
For on the other hand, those
who, once again, have grasped the
seriousness of the situation, urge
a practical, hard-headed liquida
tion and, in the process (for our
security of course)—suicide.
