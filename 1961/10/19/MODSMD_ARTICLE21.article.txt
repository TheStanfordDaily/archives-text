# SATURDAY BATTLE IN SEATTLE
## Injured Indians Test Huskies 
### BEN TIPTON 
Although still aching slightly
from their last two outings, Stan
ford’s battling Indians can be
granted a good chaice to collect
another scalp when they engage
the Washington Huskies at Se
attle this Saturday.

The Cards will he missing Tarry
Royse, their most consistent
ground gainer until he suffered a
broken collar bone against Michi
gan Stale (wo weeks ago. Also ab
sent wall be pile-driving fullback
Hal Steuber, another Michigan
State casualty.

KNI) STKVK Pursell, yet an
other first stringer sidelined by
the Michigan Stators, will be back
in action this Saturday. His in
jured foot kept him out of last
week’s victory over San Jose
State.

Ailing after the San Jose en
counter were tackle Frank Atkin
son, knee injury, and Ken Baba
jian, hip point. Shaken up was
quarterback Chuck Butler. None
of these mishaps is serious,
though, and all three are expected
to see action against Washington.

The Huskies were nursing a
king-size injury themselves last
week against Cal; half of their of
fense was missing in the person
of Charlie Mitchell, a junior half
back who led Washington’s Rose
Bowl-bound cohorts in total rush
ing last year as a sophomore. His
appearance against the Indians is
still in doubt, but if on the field
he will certainly make his pres
ence felt.

THU INDIANS will go into the
game with several factors in their
favor. After four weeks of rough
and rugged play, the Stanford
gridders have emerged as the
most potent scoring threat in the
Big Five, and the least scored
upon. Incidentally, they also have
the league’s best won-lost record.

Card end George Honore tops
the league in pass receiving, with
14 grabs good for 139 yards. He
got two last Saturday against San
Jose. Frank Patitucci, a sopho
more subbing for injured end
Pursell, was voted lineman of the
week in Northern California for
his brilliant defensive work
against the Spartans.
Stanford, traditionally air-mind
ed, has this year added a potent
ground attack to make the 3961
Indians the best-balanced squad
in x’ecent history. The Big Red
Machine ground out 235 yards
rushing against San Jose, added
68 more via the airways, and col
lected 20 first downs in the proc
ess.
SPARKING this year’s football

renaissance on the Farm is a star
studded group of sophomores.
Along with Atkinson, Babajian
and Patitucci are standout quar
terback Steve Thurlow, halfbacks

Danny Spence, Mike Barnes, and
Tyce Fitzmorris, guard Frank Du
bofsky, and tackle A1 Hildebrand,
to mention only a few. They don’t
do it alone by any means, but any
of them is capable of stepping into
the breach should the man ahead
be knocked out. Several already
have.

Running the club from the sig
nal-calling spot are Rod Sears,
Thurlow and Chuck Butler, in no
particular order. Thurlow was the
hero last week as he accounted
for 109 of the Cards’ 303 offensive
yards. Butler saved the Tulane
game with a last-ditch pass good
for the winning score.
Giving authority to the out
standing Stanford offense is a
nearly leakproof defense. They
hold San Jose’s vaunted speed
sters to less than 100 yards on the
ground, and performed creditably
against one of the outstanding
passing attacks on the West
Coast.

still in doubt, but if on the field

THU INDIANS will go into the
game with several factors in their

gridders have emerged as the
most potent scoring threat in the

the league’s best won-lost record.

Card end George Honore tops
the league in pass receiving, with
14 grabs good for 139 yards. He

his brilliant defensive work
against the Spartans.
Stanford, traditionally air-mind

ground attack to make the 3961

LINDSKOG — A DANGEROUS THREAT ON THE GROUND TOO
Stan Lindskog, whose left foot is a vital part of the Stanford offense, rips off a good gain against
San Jose State in last Saturday's game. Blocking for the Tribe are Randy Vahan (76) and Gary Craig
(40) while Frank Patitucci (82) looks on. Lindskog has booted three field goals this season.
Although still aching slightly
from their last two outings, Stan
ford’s battling Indians can be
granted a good chaice to collect
another scalp when they engage
the Washington Huskies at Se
attle this Saturday.

The Cards will he missing Tarry
Royse, their most consistent
ground gainer until he suffered a
broken collar bone against Michi
gan Stale (wo weeks ago. Also ab
sent wall be pile-driving fullback
Hal Steuber, another Michigan
State casualty.

KNI) STKVK Pursell, yet an
other first stringer sidelined by
the Michigan Stators, will be back
in action this Saturday. His in
jured foot kept him out of last
week’s victory over San Jose
State.

Ailing after the San Jose en
counter were tackle Frank Atkin
son, knee injury, and Ken Baba
jian, hip point. Shaken up was
quarterback Chuck Butler. None
of these mishaps is serious,
though, and all three are expected
to see action against Washington.

The Huskies were nursing a
king-size injury themselves last
week against Cal; half of their of
fense was missing in the person
of Charlie Mitchell, a junior half
back who led Washington’s Rose
Bowl-bound cohorts in total rush
ing last year as a sophomore. His
appearance against the Indians is
still in doubt, but if on the field
he will certainly make his pres
ence felt.

THU INDIANS will go into the
game with several factors in their
favor. After four weeks of rough
and rugged play, the Stanford
gridders have emerged as the
most potent scoring threat in the
Big Five, and the least scored
upon. Incidentally, they also have
the league’s best won-lost record.

Card end George Honore tops
the league in pass receiving, with
14 grabs good for 139 yards. He
got two last Saturday against San
Jose. Frank Patitucci, a sopho
more subbing for injured end
Pursell, was voted lineman of the
week in Northern California for
his brilliant defensive work
against the Spartans.
Stanford, traditionally air-mind
ed, has this year added a potent
ground attack to make the 3961
Indians the best-balanced squad
in x’ecent history. The Big Red
Machine ground out 235 yards
rushing against San Jose, added
68 more via the airways, and col
lected 20 first downs in the proc
ess.
SPARKING this year’s football

renaissance on the Farm is a star
studded group of sophomores.
Along with Atkinson, Babajian
and Patitucci are standout quar
terback Steve Thurlow, halfbacks

Danny Spence, Mike Barnes, and
Tyce Fitzmorris, guard Frank Du
bofsky, and tackle A1 Hildebrand,
to mention only a few. They don’t
do it alone by any means, but any
of them is capable of stepping into
the breach should the man ahead
be knocked out. Several already
have.

Running the club from the sig
nal-calling spot are Rod Sears,
Thurlow and Chuck Butler, in no
particular order. Thurlow was the
hero last week as he accounted
for 109 of the Cards’ 303 offensive
yards. Butler saved the Tulane
game with a last-ditch pass good
for the winning score.
Giving authority to the out
standing Stanford offense is a
nearly leakproof defense. They
hold San Jose’s vaunted speed
sters to less than 100 yards on the
ground, and performed creditably
against one of the outstanding
passing attacks on the West
Coast.
