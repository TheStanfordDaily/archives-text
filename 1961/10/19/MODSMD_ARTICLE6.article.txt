### 
PARIS (UPI) - Thousands of
Moslem Algerians attempted to
stage mass demonstrations in the
streets of Paris for the second
straight night yesterday but a
huge turnout of reinforced riot
police rounded them up as fast as
they came out.

The Algerians turned out again
only hours after the French gov
ernment announced it was deport
ing to Algeria 1,500 of an esti
mated 30.000 Algerian Moslems
who ran riot through Paris last
night and virtually took over sec
tions of the city lor six hours.
THE NEW demonstrations
erupted as France was bogged
down by a strike of nearly half a
million state employes seeking
pay raises in defiance of President
Charles de Gaulle’s wage freeze
policy. The strike wave threw
French railroads and gas and
electric services into choas.
The regular 22,000-man Paris
city police force was aided Tues
day night by mechanized gen
darmes and armed riot police who
moved into the city streets to re
inforce them in late afternoon.
Last night’s police action fol
lowed the arrest of 11,538 Mos
lems who rioted in the rainswept
streets all over the capital Tues
day night.
GOVERNMENT spokesman
Louis Terrenoire announced after
a cabinet meeting that more than
11,500 Algerian Moslems had been
arrested—the largest number in
a single such operation in the
city’s history.
Me said two rioters were killed
and 44 others injured. Two police
men suffered bullet wounds.
Terrenoire announced that 1,500
of the arrested Moslems would he
shipped back to war-torn Algeria
within 48 hours and confined to
their native villages. Others will
be deported later, he said.
SIX MOKE companies of tough
Republican security guards and
four squadrons of mobile gen
darmes—more than 1,500 men in

all—were ordered to Paris.
In Algeria yesterday, racial
rioting continued to rack the
seething port city of Oron.
One European was reported
fatally shot in Oran and several
Europeans and Moslems were
wounded, raising yesterday’s
death toll to at least 12 in the
almost daily battles between Eu
ropean and Moslem residents of
the West Algerian port.

QUITO, Ecuador (UFI) New
political rioting swept two Ecua
dorean cities yesterday. The army
was called in at Cuenca and po
lice and university students clash
ed in street warfare in Guayaquil.
Authorities in Guayaquil
charged students with sabers
drawn and fired volleys of tear
gas into their midst to break up
anti-government street demon
strations. Several students were
injured. The government has
charged a “huge revolutionary
plot’’ is underway in Guayaquil.
In Cuenca, the army was forced
to step in after 48 hours of inter
mittent street fighting between
pro and anti-government factions.
There was no immediate report of
casualties.
