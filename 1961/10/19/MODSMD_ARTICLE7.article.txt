# 'K' Predicts Soviet Supremacy by 1980

### 
MOSCOW ( UPl)—Premier Nikita Khrushchev yesterday prom
ised the Soviet people a rosy future of a world without war and
without want—a world in which he foresaw capitalism crumbling
and communism supreme around the earth.
Khrushchev promised this utopia by 1980, if the world Slavs at

’peace.
And he told assembled leaders
of world communism they can
have every confidence of “pre
venting a world war” because
“the balance of world political,
economic and military forces has
changed in favor of the peace
loving Communist camp.”
SPEAKING as first secretary
of the Soviet Communist Party,
Khrushchev presented his party
“platform” to more than 5,000
delegates at the second day of the
22nd Party Congress inside the
ancient Kremlin.
The six-hour speech Khrush
chev’s second in two days re
peated the flowing promises pub
lished last July in the Kremlin’s
new 20-year program to give Rus
sia a “peaceful” victory over the
United States.
IT ALSO issued a special invita
tion to the underdeveloped na
tions of Latin America, Asia and
Africa to “throw off the yoke of
colonialism and enter on the road
to socialism.”
But his speech contained none
of the bombshells of Tuesday’s
six-hour address in which he an
nounced Soviet plans to explode a
50-megaton hydrogen bomb and
tentatively lifted his year-end
deadline for concluding a sepa
rate Soviet peace treaty with East
Germany.
THE SOVIET chieftain yester
day declared the principle aim of
the Communist party foreign pol
icy is: “No war, to banish it from
the life of society in one genera
tion.”
“Once the Soviet Union will
have become the first industrial
power,” he said, “once the so
cialist system will have become
the decisive factor of world de
velopment, the scale will tilt and
the barometer of international
weather will show: ‘clear,’ the
menace of world war is gone,
never to return.”
IN THE MEANTIME Khrush
chev said, the Soviets will main
tain “the most up-to-date means
for the defense of our homeland,
atomic and thermo nuclear weap
ons and rockets of every range. . .
the strengthening of U.S.S.R. de
fense and the might of the Soviet
armed forces.”
Khrushchev told the delegates
that “American capitalism has
passed its prime and is on the
decline” and said the United
States is “the epicenter of capi
talism’s economic difficulties.”
A WEAKNESS of the capital
istic powers, he said, is that war
production has become a“perma
nent element” of their economy,
with “15 to 20 per cent of the
national income spent on arma
ments.”
Another capitalistic weakness,
he said, was vast unemployment
in the western world where, he
declared, “on the average one man
in every nine is unemployed.”
Khrushchev, nevertheless, urged
communists to learn from the
capitalists particularly their
methods of speeding up construc
tion and running new enterprises.
