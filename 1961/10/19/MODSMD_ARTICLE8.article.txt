ened South Viet Nam. The declaration was timed to coincide with

the Red guerrilla menace.
lay lor s conclusions may determine whether President Kennedy

commits U.S. combat troop to<
help stop communism from en
gulfing all Southeast Asia.
HE LOST little time in plunging
into what he described as an
“across-the-board assessment” of
the situation. Almost immediately
after his arrival yesterday he held
a round of conferences with Diem
and top American military and
diplomatic officials.

The state of emergency decree
suspends the application of all
laws as necessary during the du
ration of the emergency which
will continue until “further no
tice.”
It was a first step to rally the
national resources for an all-out
struggle against the Communists
within and outside the frontiers.
THE NATIONAL assembly mot
to discuss a draft bill giving Diem
“exceptional powers” and approv
al was a foregone conclusion.
Taylor began his appraisal of
what military measures the Unit
ed States must take to keep Com
munists from overrunning South
Viet Nam with a three-hour brief
ing at the U.S. embassy.
Ho was given a fill-in on the
overall military, political, econom
ic social and ideological situation
by U.S. Ambassador Frederick
Nolting, Lt. Gen. Lionel McGarr,
head of the U.S. Military Advis
ory Group (MAG), and other dip
lomatic and military officials.

DURING the afternoon, he mot
with Diem in the presidential
palace for a general discussion
of the South Viet Nam position
caused by the increased Commu
nist pressures. There was no im
mediate information on the de
tails of the discussions.
Tomorrow, Taylor will leave for
a two-day survey of various battle
areas, including some where
American military men are train
ing anti-Communist rangers. He
is scheduled to return to Saigon
Sunday.
