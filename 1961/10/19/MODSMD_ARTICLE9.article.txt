### 
WASHINGTON ( UPII A
young Peace Corps teacher
who stirred up a controversy
by writing of “primitive” con
ditions in Nigeria left her
African post yesterday. But
she was expected to get a new
assignment elsewhere.

Corps Director Sargent
Shriver said the teacher, 23-
year-old Margery Michelmore
of Foxboro, Mass., “has not
resigned from the Peace
Corps and we do not want her
to.”

In a statement issued by
the Corps, Shriver said that
Miss Michelmore was going to
the Corps’ permanent training
center in Puerto Rico, where
she would consider assign
ment to another project.
