Why the gold bars?
Future You:
You’re needed ... just as your father and grandfather
were. It’s an obligation that a lot of qualified college
men have to meet. If we don’t...
You:
All right. But what can I do for the Air Force?
Future You:
The Air Force needs college trained men and women
as officers. This is caused by the rapidly advancing
technology that goes with hypersonic air and space
flight. Your four years of college have equipped you
to handle complex jobs.
You:
Say I was interested...how can I get to be an officer?
Future You:
You know about Air Force ROTC and the Air Force
Academy. Then there’s the navigator training pro
gram. You’ve probably heard about Officer Training
School...where the Air Force takes certain college
graduates, both men and women, and commissions
them after three months of training.
Y'ou:
Starting salary is important. What about that?
Future You:
Add it up. Base pay, tax-free allowances, free medi*
cal and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps
flight pay. You don’t have to be an eco major to see
it adds up to an attractive package.
You:
I’ve been thinking about getting my Master’s.
Future You :
As an officer you can apply for the Air Force Institute
of Technology. At no cost, and while on active duly
some officers may even win their Ph.D. degrees.
You:
Tell me more.
That’s the job of your local Air Force Recruiter.
Or write to Officer Career Information, Dept.
SCI 10, Box 7608, Washington 4, D.C., if you
want further information about the navigator
training or Officer Training School programs.

Why the gold bars?
Future You:
You’re needed ... just as your father and grandfather
were. It’s an obligation that a lot of qualified college
men have to meet. If we don’t...
You:
All right. But what can I do for the Air Force?
Future You:
The Air Force needs college trained men and women
as officers. This is caused by the rapidly advancing
technology that goes with hypersonic air and space
flight. Your four years of college have equipped you
to handle complex jobs.
You:
Say I was interested...how can I get to be an officer?
Future You:
You know about Air Force ROTC and the Air Force
Academy. Then there’s the navigator training pro
gram. You’ve probably heard about Officer Training
School...where the Air Force takes certain college
graduates, both men and women, and commissions
them after three months of training.
Y'ou:
Starting salary is important. What about that?
Future You:
Add it up. Base pay, tax-free allowances, free medi*
cal and dental care, retirement provision, perhaps
flight pay. You don’t have to be an eco major to see
it adds up to an attractive package.
You:
I’ve been thinking about getting my Master’s.
Future You :
As an officer you can apply for the Air Force Institute
of Technology. At no cost, and while on active duly
some officers may even win their Ph.D. degrees.
You:
Tell me more.
That’s the job of your local Air Force Recruiter.
Or write to Officer Career Information, Dept.
SCI 10, Box 7608, Washington 4, D.C., if you
want further information about the navigator
training or Officer Training School programs.
