## Soviet Feud Soothed by Chou En-lai 
### 
MOSCOW (UPI i Communist
Chinese Premier Chou En-lai yes
terday urged a reconciliation be
tween Russia and Albania, the
tiny Communist nation which has
come under the fire of Soviet
Premier Nikita C. Khrushchev.
Chou’s speech before the Soviet
Communist party’s 22nd congress
followed by 48 hours Khrush
chev’s denunciation of Albania for
adhering to Stalinist methods.
CHOU ALONE among speakers
at the Communist congress listed
Albania as one of the Communist
bloc “people’s democracies,” He
advised Russia and Albania to get
together and work out their dif
ferences in friendly fashion and
criticized the public quarrel as not
true to Marxism, it was learned.
Chou was lavish in hi-s praise of
the Soviet Union. But throughout
his speech he placed Moscow and
Peiping on an equal footing, never
conceding Soviet leadership with
in the Communist bloc.
The Chinese premier said, how
ever, that the “Chinese people had
always advocated the application
of the principles of peaceful co
existence”—a cornerstone of Sovi
et policy “between countries
with differing social systems” and
cited friendship treaties he had
signed with Asian and African
nations.
Chou called Khrushchev’s 20-
year party program a “tremen
dous inspiration” and praised past
Soviet industrial progress. He also
pledged “deep friendship” for the
Kremlin leaders several times.
“AS THE Yangtse and the Vol
ga will forever carry their waters
so will the great cohesion and
friendship between our people live
forever through the ages,” he said.
The Chinese leader also de
nounced President Kennedy as a
treacherous and adventurous man
who is feverishly preparing for
war.
Western newsmen were barred
from yesterday’s congress session,
but persons attending it reported
on the speeches of Chou and other
leaders. It was learned that ex-
Premier Georgi Malenkov and ex-
Presidium member Lazar Kagan
ovich were denounced anew and
probably would be expelled from
the party.
Chou said Kennedy holds out an
olive branch but is preparing a
war. He said the United States in
vaded Cuba and carried out pro
vocations in Laos, Viet Nam and
Formosa. He charged the United
States with disrupting the Geneva
nuclear tost ban conference and
preparing for both local wars and
a nuclear war.
THE SOVIET feud with Alba
nia was brought into the open
Tuesday by Khrushchev’s keynote
speech to the Congress. He ac
cused Albania of trying to return
to the Stalinist “cult of the per
sonality.” Albania and Yugoslavia
are the only Communist nations
not represented at the congress.
Two leading European Commu
nists rose to Khrushchev’s sup
port yesterday, but Chou took ex
ception to the public hearing of
quarrels between two Communist
nations.
Polish Communist chief Wlady
slaw Gomulka and French party
leader Maurice Thorez strongly
vacked Khrushchev with their
own attacks on Albania.

Chou’s speech before the Soviet
Communist party’s 22nd congress
followed by 48 hours Khrush
chev’s denunciation of Albania for
adhering to Stalinist methods.
CHOU ALONE among speakers
at the Communist congress listed
Albania as one of the Communist
bloc “people’s democracies,” He
advised Russia and Albania to get
together and work out their dif
ferences in friendly fashion and
criticized the public quarrel as not
true to Marxism, it was learned.
Chou was lavish in hi-s praise of
the Soviet Union. But throughout
his speech he placed Moscow and
Peiping on an equal footing, never
conceding Soviet leadership with
in the Communist bloc.
The Chinese premier said, how
ever, that the “Chinese people had
always advocated the application
of the principles of peaceful co
existence”—a cornerstone of Sovi
et policy “between countries
with differing social systems” and
cited friendship treaties he had
signed with Asian and African
nations.
Chou called Khrushchev’s 20-
year party program a “tremen
dous inspiration” and praised past
Soviet industrial progress. He also
pledged “deep friendship” for the
Kremlin leaders several times.
“AS THE Yangtse and the Vol
ga will forever carry their waters
so will the great cohesion and
friendship between our people live
forever through the ages,” he said.
The Chinese leader also de
nounced President Kennedy as a
treacherous and adventurous man
who is feverishly preparing for
war.
Western newsmen were barred
from yesterday’s congress session,
but persons attending it reported
on the speeches of Chou and other
leaders. It was learned that ex-
Premier Georgi Malenkov and ex-
Presidium member Lazar Kagan
ovich were denounced anew and
probably would be expelled from
the party.
Chou said Kennedy holds out an
olive branch but is preparing a
war. He said the United States in
vaded Cuba and carried out pro
vocations in Laos, Viet Nam and
Formosa. He charged the United
States with disrupting the Geneva
nuclear tost ban conference and
preparing for both local wars and
a nuclear war.
THE SOVIET feud with Alba
nia was brought into the open
Tuesday by Khrushchev’s keynote
speech to the Congress. He ac
