# Players Production Is Intense, Poetic
## 
### BRIDGET HURSLEY DOBSON 
“The Master of Santiago” dramatizes the eternal conflict of
spiritual values and material values in the soul of a man. In this
somber but moving drama written by Henry de Montherlant, the
conflict is between God and mammon, the marketplace and the
monastery. Although the play was set in sixteenth century Castile,

its central theme of value con
flict has modern applications.
The Stanford Players’ produc
tion, under the direction of James
Kerans, was, for the most part,
excellent. There were moments
when the play seemed heavy
footed. Some of the speeches
were too long, and the religious
passion got pretty thick. But, for
the most part, the play was
highly dramatic, and often even
poetic.
AS THE Master of Santiago
(Don Alvaro Da bo), Steven Gil
horn was intense and sometimes
righteous. But he always main
tained a subtle quality of wisdom
and sensitivity, which was believ
able as well as winning. His role
was a difficult one. He portrayed
a man struggling for spirituality
and humility, and handled it ad
mirably.
Richard Risso, in the role of
Don Bernal de Encina, acted with
professional competence. He was
a charming and persuading
knight (the only knight who was
not, in Don Alvaro’s words, a
mere “knight of clay”) and friend
of the Master. He represented a
rational view of the values of the
materialistic world. (Who hut the
rich man can afford to be truly
charitable? Is it not a “natural
impulse” to want possessions?)
AS MARIANA, the daughter of
the Master, Samira Kirollos was
adequate in her part. She was
intense and serious in striving to
adopt her father’s values. The
role would have carried more
conviction had Miss Kirollos var
ied the pace of her speeches. She
rushed her lines and, in doing so,
lost dramatic intensity. Neverthe
less, she did reach an effective
climax in a monologue in which
she revealed a breathless first
love for a young man. Later, in
renouncing this same man in
favor of a“spiritual life,” she lost
some poignancy in the lines, by
hurrying through them.
The other knights—played by
Robert Putnam, Michael Addison,
William Louis, and Fred Watkins
—were knightly.
The costumes by Douglas Rus
sell were magnificent. I do not
exaggerate. They w’ere perhaps
the finest costumes I have ever
seen in an amateur production.

knight had a beautiful belt set
with turquoise stones, another

costumes were not hastily thrown
together.

tere but appropriate set.
The play continues tonight and
tomorrow and Wednesday
through Saturday next week, Oct.
25-28. Tickets are $2 for Friday
and Saturday evenings and $1.50
for Wednesday and Thursday eve
nings. Stanford students are eli
gible for a 50-cent discount from
both prices.

adequate in her part. She was
intense and serious in striving to
adopt her father’s values. The
role would have carried more
conviction had Miss Kirollos var
ied the pace of her speeches. She
rushed her lines and, in doing so,
lost dramatic intensity. Neverthe
less, she did reach an effective
climax in a monologue in which
she revealed a breathless first
love for a young man. Later, in
renouncing this same man in
favor of a“spiritual life,” she lost
some poignancy in the lines, by
hurrying through them.
The other knights—played by
Robert Putnam, Michael Addison,
William Louis, and Fred Watkins
—were knightly.
The costumes by Douglas Rus
sell were magnificent. I do not
exaggerate. They w’ere perhaps
the finest costumes I have ever
seen in an amateur production.

“The Master of Santiago” dramatizes the eternal conflict of
spiritual values and material values in the soul of a man. In this
somber but moving drama written by Henry de Montherlant, the
conflict is between God and mammon, the marketplace and the
monastery. Although the play was set in sixteenth century Castile,

its central theme of value con
flict has modern applications.
The Stanford Players’ produc
tion, under the direction of James
Kerans, was, for the most part,
excellent. There were moments
when the play seemed heavy
footed. Some of the speeches
were too long, and the religious
passion got pretty thick. But, for
the most part, the play was
highly dramatic, and often even
poetic.
AS THE Master of Santiago
(Don Alvaro Da bo), Steven Gil
horn was intense and sometimes
righteous. But he always main
tained a subtle quality of wisdom
and sensitivity, which was believ
able as well as winning. His role
was a difficult one. He portrayed
a man struggling for spirituality
and humility, and handled it ad
mirably.
Richard Risso, in the role of
Don Bernal de Encina, acted with
professional competence. He was
a charming and persuading
knight (the only knight who was
not, in Don Alvaro’s words, a
mere “knight of clay”) and friend
of the Master. He represented a
rational view of the values of the
materialistic world. (Who hut the
rich man can afford to be truly
charitable? Is it not a “natural
impulse” to want possessions?)
AS MARIANA, the daughter of
the Master, Samira Kirollos was
adequate in her part. She was
intense and serious in striving to
adopt her father’s values. The
role would have carried more
conviction had Miss Kirollos var
ied the pace of her speeches. She
