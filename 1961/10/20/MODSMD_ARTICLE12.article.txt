# Farm Board Lists Ladera Dam Faults

’ Adequate Hood control of the San Francisquito creek can be de
veloped faster and at far less cost than the proposed Ladera dam,
Stanford’s Board of Trustees said yesterday.
The proposed dam would lie in the heart of Stanford’s San Ma
teo County lands, roughly halfway between Alpine and Sand Hill

roads.
The controversial Ladera Dam
flood control project has been
proposed by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers and already ap
proved by the Palo Alto City
Council.

land including the University’s
Jasper Ridge biological experi
ment area.
Jasper Ridge is a 735-acre pre
serve which lies in the Searsville
Lake area and consists of a unique
association of rock ledges and out
croppings, grassland, oak-dotted
savannahs, chaparral, redwoods,
marshland streams and pools.
By flooding the base of the
ridge, the dam “would alter or
destroy irretrievably an entire bi
ological community,” Ira L. Wig
gins, professor of biology has
pointed out to the manager of the
University’s physical facilities.

STANFORD, however, is on rec
ord as opposing the dam. The
trustees pledged University co
operation to work with surround
ing communities in developing
“economically feasible alterna
tives” to the “costly, massive, high
level dam proposed by the Corps
of Engineers.”
The proposed dam will obliter
ate at least 540 acres of Stanford

“Stanford University is one of
the very few educational and re
search institutions in the United
States that owns outright an ex
perimental and teaching resource
comparable to Jasper Ridge,” he
said.

IN AN effort to prevent this
loss of land, Stanford trustees
yesterday presented several alter
nate proposals;

“A large measure of flood con
trol can be achieved by improve
ment to the creek channel through
Menlo Park and Palo Alto. Such
improvements need not create an
unsightly channel or disturb the
present esthetic values of the
creek.

“The moderate improvements
would significantly lessen the im
mediate danger of flooding which
the Corps of Engineers’ proposal
does not do. Since no construction
could start until further studies
were completed and funds for the
project were authorized by Con
gress, the dam would provide no
immediate flood control for Menlo
Park and Palo Alto.

THEY ALSO could be supple
mented by additional reservoir
stoi'age in the foothills that would
provide for flood control.
“Such storage might be achieved
in part by enlarging existing Uni
versity reservoirs, or by construc
tion of a smaller reservoir at any
one of four possible sites.

“Th e proposed recreational
benefits of Ladera Dam could be
obtained by expanding the exist
ing facilities at Searsville Lake
Park.”

THE TRUSTEES believe these
proposals “would minimize dam
age to Stanford’s highly valuable
Jasper Ridge biological preserve,
would avoid the problems of a rec
reational area in the vicinity of
one of the world’s most important
instruments for nuclear research,
and would materially reduce the
effects of a large and unsightly
scar on the face of an otherwise
attractive area.

“In summary, all the benefits
promised by the Corps of Engin
eel’s project can be achieved for a
much smaller expenditure of pub
lic funds without depriving Stan
ford of essential campus lands,”
the trustees said. Cost of the La
dera dam, as estimated by the
Corps of Engineers, would be at
least $8,400,000.
