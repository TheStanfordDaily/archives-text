# Admit Red China to The United Nations
## 
### 
Communist C-liina will be* admitted to the United Nations before
the end of next year at the latest. Tin's is an international fact of
life which the United States refuses to recognize, as is indicated
by President Kennedy’s statement yesterday that the U.S. “firmly
opposes” Red China’s admission to the world parliament.
If it holds to this firm stand, the U.S. will find itself lonely and
laughed at when the decisive vote comes and Red China is voted a
seat in the 1 U.N. From all reports, the other 100 members of the
U.N. are ready to do this, and it is only a question of whether the
matter can get through this year or next.
It is ironic that this country lias fought the issue for 12 years,
with each year the vote on our side dwindling.
It is ironic because in that lime Red China has become a world
power and chances of keeping Formosa in the U.N. (a main U.S.
goal) have grown dimmer each year. Now, it appears that the U.N.
members, besides admitting Red China, may throw Formosa com
pletely out of the* United Nations—leaving Mao Tse-tnng to take
over Chiang’s seat on the Security Council.
It is obvious that Red China is not, to put it mildly, a “desirable”
member of the United Nations. Its material progress since 1949 has
come at the cost of millions of lives and the degradation of human
dignity and rights.
But there are a number of nations, including some U.S. allies,
which do not technically qualify as “peace loving” nations under
the U.N. Charter. Yet they are in the organization and their pres
ence is vital to whatever success the U.N. is able to bring about in
its quest for peace.
We feel Red China’s presence in the United Nation is just as
necessary—if a permanent peace is to be negotiatecWas Russia’s or
our own. Assuming that the Peiping rulers will be admitted before
long, it would seem wise for the U.S. to go along with the fact, ex
tending its energies not to fighting a lost and unrealistic fight, but
to working out an arrangement whereby Formosa remains in the
United Nations.
While we do not admire the way Chiang governs, we do feel
the people of Formosa deserve representation in the U.N. The
leadership of the U.S. could assure that.

to working out an arrangement whereby Formosa remains in the
United Nations.
While we do not admire the way Chiang governs, we do feel
the people of Formosa deserve representation in the U.N. The
leadership of the U.S. could assure that.
Communist C-liina will be* admitted to the United Nations before
the end of next year at the latest. Tin's is an international fact of
life which the United States refuses to recognize, as is indicated
by President Kennedy’s statement yesterday that the U.S. “firmly
opposes” Red China’s admission to the world parliament.
If it holds to this firm stand, the U.S. will find itself lonely and
laughed at when the decisive vote comes and Red China is voted a
seat in the 1 U.N. From all reports, the other 100 members of the
U.N. are ready to do this, and it is only a question of whether the
matter can get through this year or next.
It is ironic that this country lias fought the issue for 12 years,
with each year the vote on our side dwindling.
It is ironic because in that lime Red China has become a world
power and chances of keeping Formosa in the U.N. (a main U.S.
goal) have grown dimmer each year. Now, it appears that the U.N.
members, besides admitting Red China, may throw Formosa com
pletely out of the* United Nations—leaving Mao Tse-tnng to take
over Chiang’s seat on the Security Council.
It is obvious that Red China is not, to put it mildly, a “desirable”
member of the United Nations. Its material progress since 1949 has
come at the cost of millions of lives and the degradation of human
dignity and rights.
But there are a number of nations, including some U.S. allies,
which do not technically qualify as “peace loving” nations under
the U.N. Charter. Yet they are in the organization and their pres
ence is vital to whatever success the U.N. is able to bring about in
its quest for peace.
We feel Red China’s presence in the United Nation is just as
necessary—if a permanent peace is to be negotiatecWas Russia’s or
our own. Assuming that the Peiping rulers will be admitted before
long, it would seem wise for the U.S. to go along with the fact, ex
tending its energies not to fighting a lost and unrealistic fight, but
to working out an arrangement whereby Formosa remains in the
United Nations.
