# MOVIE REVIEW
## High Standard Results Offered in 'The Joker' 
### DEREK DAVIS 
Jean-Pierre Cassel is probably
not a man of wide talents. Philippe
de Broca is in the same category.
Yet their combined efforts in
“The Joker’’ (Presidio Theatre,
San Francisco) pr-oduce a film
which is just a little bit more than
both of them and has just a little
more to impart than its surface
reflects.
Actor Cassel, working with di
rector De Broca in their second ef
fort (“The Love Game” was the
first, and a third is on the way),
has all the vitality of a corps of
cheerleaders.
Humor is seldom so much the
object of the film as gaiety, and
at least two-thirds of that gaiety
is channelled directly through this
bright young man who spends his
time frisking through life like a
puppy attracted by a note that
no mere human can hear.
FOR ALL of that, De Broca is
not strictly concerned with the
portrayal of a lovable rogue’s phi
landering exploits. As we follow
Edward Berlot (Cassel) across
the roofs of Paris in escapes from
enraged husbands and in search
of the flame of his heart, Helene
(Anouk Amee), we are slowly
brought to the realization that this
vibrant, sensually-driven spirit is
an elemental expression of the
purity and directness in man
which can be one of his highest
goods. It is somewhat reminiscent
of the gentle fondling of humanity
to be found in Steinbeck’s “Tor
tilla Flat.”
In its approach to sex, the film
is, trite as it may seem, typically
French. There is no shyness, no
hesitancy, no pretence, and, as a
result—no vulgarity. Edward Ber
lot is a man constantly on the
make, joyous over his successes,
despondent over his failures, but
always ready to try again.
When smitten by love for
Helene, he sweeps her from her
husband by brute force of person
ality.
YET, WHEN the end has come,
with love, the weather and Helene
turning cold, he has not lost the
reserves necessary to bounce back
and end the film in dancing pur
suit of the next pretty face. On a
small scale, perhaps, in a trivial

instance, he is the indomitable
soul of man.
Also typically French is the
handling of continuity. The bare
plot (and bare it is) is adhered
to in the sequence of scenes, yet
many an individual scene is noth
ing more than the explosion of
humor and joy which comes from
Berlot being Berlot.
For perfection of technique,
this disjointed method comes no
where near the brilliant comedy
of Jacques Tati (“Mr. Hulot’s
Holiday”), nor is there any indi
cation that De Broca is capable of
such precision, and it seems cer
tain that it could not have held
up without Cassel. Yet within its
context it is only occasionally in
effective.
A MORE SERIOUS flaw is the
imbalance of the very low-key do
mestic scenes in the first part of
the film, which exhibit Berlot’s
peculiar relatives well, but make
little use of Cassel (who isn’t
quite good enough as an actor to
carry a quiet scene for long). The
ending (again fairly “typically
French”) is abrupt, but loaves us
at the high point of Berlot’s hu
manity (at least in De Broca’s
eyes), when ho has lost his lover,
but not his capacity to love.
The camera work is usually ef
fective, especially in a speeded up
sequence which pictures the en
tire Berlot family in a frenzy of
joy at Edward’s new “find.” Un
fortunately, some of the best film
work is lost behind the credits,
as Cassel navigates nimbly across
roof-ridges with the Eiffel Tower
over his shoulder.
GRANTED THAT credits should
not establish an oncoming spirit
of pure boredom, the present
trend toward giving them a decent
setting has progressed to the
point where both photography
and credits lose their meaning as
the audience tries valiantly to fol
low both at once.
Nothing (except perhaps the ex
istence of Cassel) is exceptional
about this film, yet it maintains
a high standard of effort, which
more often than not produces a
high standard of results. It does
not prove that all is right with the
world, but it does show a corner
in which things are pretty worth
while.
