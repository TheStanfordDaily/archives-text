# MOVIE REVIEW
## Children Should Enjoy 'The Guns of Navarone' 
### ALAN ROSENTHAL 
“The Guns of Navarone,” (at
the Los Altos Theatre) reminds
me very much of those romps one
sees at Christmas . . . the ones ad
vertised “for children of all ages.”
Well, the children are going to
enjoy this one.
As with all. adventure stories
we know the dice are loaded for
the hero. The question is how near
can he get to failure and still suc
ceed. In “The Guns” he comes
pretty close.
This time our hero is Captain
Mallory, intrepid, hard-jawed,
taciturn and Europe’s most fa
mous alpinist. (By Jove, sir. Not
THE Mallory.) And of course he
is also alias Gregory Peck.
GREG’S TASK is to blow up
the German radar-controlled guns
of the island of Navarone, which
dominate the escape route of hun
dreds of stranded British troops.
Squadrons have failed in the
task. Massed assault forces have
failed. Can Greg and his daunt
less band succeed . . . ?
“Madness. Not a chance,” says
Group Captain Robertson Justice
behind his Virginia tobacco smoke
screen. But what if mighty Mal
lory is aided by David Niven as
Dusty, the wonder wizard of the
ninth grade chcm lab, and a few
other entrancing characters such
as the Butcher of Barcelona.
You’re dead right.
AND BEFORE the first nasty
German has met his watery grave
even the most unperccptive doc
toral candidate in the audience
will tell you that 6,000 Germans,
300 tanks, 70 Bren gun carriers,
49 motor cyclists and Felix the
ferocious fox hound are no match
for Greg’s intrepid group. Do the
Germans stand a chance? Not on
your Nellie.
Before the climax, which has
made me abandon the elevator as
a means of public transport for
ever, storms, cliffs, bombs, snow
troops, treachery, gangrene and
women help hinder the raiders.
To no avail.
There is one rather loathesome
British officer who nearly screws
up the works, but he is effectively
dealt with. Actually, this character
gave me an enormous amount of
pleasure. We may love Lassie,
admire Bardot’s structural archi
tecture, eulogize Bergman but
these are minor joys compared to
being given a real villain we can
hiss. Especially an Englishman.
THE CLIMAX works nicely.
Less successful are the passages
seemingly inserted because some
one felt he ought to make it a
prestige “think” picture as well.
The questionings of fear, coward
ice, bravery, communication and
meaning in war are superficially
dealt with and don’t work.
They are best ignored in the
context. Thus I squirmed when

after a really trite truism of the
Group Captain, aide Brian Forbes
looks straight into the camera
and says ‘'why . . . you are a
philosopher, sir.”
The humour is passable, the di
rection fair. The film is twice as
long as it should be but better
than Maclean’s book. The music
is pleasant except for the peren
nial heavenly choir (union rules,
boys?) which fairly lambasts the
Aegean at the end.
GREATEST enjoyment comes
from the locale and the colour
photography; the beauty of a
bomber limping blackly in against
the sunset, the quiet of the hills
and sea at dusk, and timeless
columns against a night sky.
And then there is the breath
less peace and wonderment of the
Greek islands themselves.
If you have any blood left in
your body your reaction after the
film will he to grab your favourite
girl, a guitar and manuscript pa
per, and head for Mykonos, Crete
or Rhodes where a 30-footer
awaits you and you can indulge
in the only life fit for a human
being.

screen. But what if mighty Mal
lory is aided by David Niven as
Dusty, the wonder wizard of the
ninth grade chcm lab, and a few
other entrancing characters such
as the Butcher of Barcelona.
You’re dead right.
AND BEFORE the first nasty
German has met his watery grave
even the most unperccptive doc
toral candidate in the audience
will tell you that 6,000 Germans,
300 tanks, 70 Bren gun carriers,
49 motor cyclists and Felix the
ferocious fox hound are no match
for Greg’s intrepid group. Do the
Germans stand a chance? Not on
your Nellie.
Before the climax, which has
made me abandon the elevator as
a means of public transport for
ever, storms, cliffs, bombs, snow
troops, treachery, gangrene and
women help hinder the raiders.
To no avail.
There is one rather loathesome
British officer who nearly screws
up the works, but he is effectively
dealt with. Actually, this character
gave me an enormous amount of
pleasure. We may love Lassie,
admire Bardot’s structural archi
tecture, eulogize Bergman but
these are minor joys compared to
being given a real villain we can
hiss. Especially an Englishman.
THE CLIMAX works nicely.
Less successful are the passages
seemingly inserted because some
one felt he ought to make it a
prestige “think” picture as well.
The questionings of fear, coward
ice, bravery, communication and
meaning in war are superficially
dealt with and don’t work.
They are best ignored in the
context. Thus I squirmed when

after a really trite truism of the
Group Captain, aide Brian Forbes
looks straight into the camera
and says ‘'why . . . you are a
philosopher, sir.”
The humour is passable, the di
rection fair. The film is twice as
long as it should be but better
than Maclean’s book. The music
is pleasant except for the peren
nial heavenly choir (union rules,
boys?) which fairly lambasts the
Aegean at the end.
GREATEST enjoyment comes
from the locale and the colour
photography; the beauty of a
bomber limping blackly in against
the sunset, the quiet of the hills
and sea at dusk, and timeless
columns against a night sky.
And then there is the breath
less peace and wonderment of the
Greek islands themselves.
If you have any blood left in
your body your reaction after the
film will he to grab your favourite
girl, a guitar and manuscript pa
per, and head for Mykonos, Crete
or Rhodes where a 30-footer
awaits you and you can indulge
in the only life fit for a human
being.
“The Guns of Navarone,” (at
the Los Altos Theatre) reminds
me very much of those romps one
sees at Christmas . . . the ones ad
vertised “for children of all ages.”
Well, the children are going to
enjoy this one.
As with all. adventure stories
we know the dice are loaded for
the hero. The question is how near
can he get to failure and still suc
ceed. In “The Guns” he comes
pretty close.
This time our hero is Captain
Mallory, intrepid, hard-jawed,
taciturn and Europe’s most fa
mous alpinist. (By Jove, sir. Not
THE Mallory.) And of course he
is also alias Gregory Peck.
GREG’S TASK is to blow up
the German radar-controlled guns
of the island of Navarone, which
dominate the escape route of hun
dreds of stranded British troops.
Squadrons have failed in the
task. Massed assault forces have
failed. Can Greg and his daunt

admire Bardot’s structural archi
tecture, eulogize Bergman but
these are minor joys compared to
being given a real villain we can
hiss. Especially an Englishman.
THE CLIMAX works nicely.
Less successful are the passages
seemingly inserted because some
one felt he ought to make it a
prestige “think” picture as well.
The questionings of fear, coward
ice, bravery, communication and
meaning in war are superficially
dealt with and don’t work.
They are best ignored in the
context. Thus I squirmed when

after a really trite truism of the
Group Captain, aide Brian Forbes
looks straight into the camera
and says ‘'why . . . you are a
philosopher, sir.”
The humour is passable, the di
rection fair. The film is twice as
long as it should be but better
than Maclean’s book. The music
is pleasant except for the peren
nial heavenly choir (union rules,
boys?) which fairly lambasts the
Aegean at the end.
GREATEST enjoyment comes
from the locale and the colour
photography; the beauty of a
bomber limping blackly in against
the sunset, the quiet of the hills
and sea at dusk, and timeless
columns against a night sky.
And then there is the breath
less peace and wonderment of the
Greek islands themselves.
If you have any blood left in
your body your reaction after the
film will he to grab your favourite
girl, a guitar and manuscript pa
per, and head for Mykonos, Crete
or Rhodes where a 30-footer
awaits you and you can indulge
in the only life fit for a human
being.
