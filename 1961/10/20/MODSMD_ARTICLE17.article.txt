ANTI COMMUNIST RALLY
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Davis, in his article on the
Southern California School of
Anti-Communism, has clone a
great job of creating journalistic
garbage to compare favorably
with the “verbal garbage” he at
tributes to Sen. Dodd.
There can be no denying that
thoughtful criticisms of some of
the speakers at the school are in
order, but if Mr. Davis had listen
ed to the entire text of Sen. Dodd’s
speech, he would have recognized
an effort to direct the enthusiasm
of the audience from reactionary
lunacy to more moderate and
thoughtful action.
Mr. Davis is obviously having a
difficult time restraining himself
from using four-letter words. Per
haps if he wrote the weather re
port for The Daily, he would have
more time for these epileptic fits
of rage and thus spare the reader
the embarrassment of reading his
unsuccessful attempts at political
criticism.
