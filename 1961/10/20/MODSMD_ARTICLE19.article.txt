ANTI-COMMUNIST RALLY
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding one Derek Davis’
“staff opinion” article of (Oct.
18): I challenge him to set down
in a subsequent article, point by
point, every conceivable good he
can muster regarding the acts of
International Communism. Soviet
Communism, Chinese Commu
nism, or any other Communistic
government, economy or philo
sophy which is now formally ex
istent in the world.
If he can’t come up with such a
list, I demand he withdraw his
statement to the effect that to
say ‘there is nothing good about
Communism. ... It is total evil,
it is all black” is “odoriferous bits
of verbal garbage.’

SU MORALITY LEAGUE
Editor, The Daily:
In the last few days the Stan
ford Morality League has been
very active. Signs such as “The
SML does not approve of this ac
tivity” are posted prominently on
several sign up sheets.
The group seems to have good
intentions and we agree that
morals and ethics should be a part
of every student. The SML could
be a worthwhile organization at
Stanford.
However, we are somewhat in
dignant toward their policies.
Serving in a counseling capacity,
the SML could be of help to Stan
ford students. But the tone of
their missives is a little heavy.
Every individual in the Uni
versity has a sense of responsibili
ty. The job of the SML should be
to direct, not supplant, this sense.
Students are perfectly capable of
making their own decisions, and
a friendly word of advice should
be sufficient.
