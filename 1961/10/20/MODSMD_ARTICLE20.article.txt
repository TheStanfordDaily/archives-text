# MEET YOSHIHIKO FUJISAWA
## Japan's Foreign Scholar 
### MARK DRAPER 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
first of a series of articles intro
ducing tills year's ASSU foreign
scholars.)

Yoshihiko Fujisawa is a be
spectacled, serious young man
studying political science at Stan
ford under the ASSU Foreign
Scholarship Program.
He is the son of a retired officer
of the Japanese Imperial Army,
and is an intelligent, good student
with a quick sense of humor.
His good physique (he exorcises
daily), easy coordination and
alertness contribute to one’s im
pression that he is a capable, well
rounded sort of person who does
well in whatever he undertakes.
This writer felt that the “real”
Fuji might best emerge in an in
formal situation, and the follow
ing questions and answers are the
result of an hour-long conversa
tion over a couple of beers.
QUESTION: Fuji, why did you
deside to come to Stanford?
ANSWER: “For two main rea
sons. First, academic. I am inter
ested in Communist China, and
Stanford has the reputation of
having the best resources for
study in this field. Second, I liked
Americans I had met in Japan and
wanted an opportunity to learn
more about them.
“I feel the Second World War
was due in large part to the fact
that most of the communication
between Japan and America in
the period preceding the war was
between (he governments and not
the people.
“Because the people of both na
tions did not know anyone on an
individual basis from the other
country they fell back on stereo
types which are so amenable to
distortion through propaganda,
hence did not actively resist the
gradual descent into war.”
Q. WHY do you wish to study
about Communist China?

A. “China and Japan are closely
connected both geographically
and historically, and in the future
Japan should have some economic
and political ties with China. Of
course, for some time there will
be only economic ties.

“Under the present conditions
we can’t expect too much, but
economic ties will help bring the
nations closer together. Maybe
the political link is not feasible,
but the economic ties would he
valuable, given that Japan first
strengthens her defenses short
of stockpiling nuclear devices
and stabilizes her domestic politi
cal situation.

“I was surprised to find that the
Republican and Democratic par
ties in this country are so similar.
In Japan there are real differ
ences and conflict between the
Liberal Democrats, the Conserva
tive party, the Democratic Social
ist, and Socialist parties.”
<{. WHAT about Japan’s future?
A. “Domestically, I think the
control by the government needs
to be, and will be, expanded. Most
students today in Japan are So
cialists. The government should
control only the productive in
dustries, and of course should
guarantee fundamental human
rights.
“Internationally, Japan is
uniquely suited to play the role of
mediator between East and West,
as she has a foot in both. This will
not be achieved unless she can
play an independent role in the
United Nations free of pressures
from the United States. She must
be allowed to decide her own for
eign policy.”
Q. How about the so-called
“Tokyo Riots”? Why did you take
part?
A. “I would like to emphasize
frist that “riots” and “demonstra
tions” are quite different things.
I took part in the demonstrations.
I saw no riots.
“Several things should be under
stood about these demonstrations.
"First, the Japanese people are
deathly afraid of the outbreak of

atomic war. Better than any other
they know the horror that is pos
sible.

“Second, all the demonstrations
were not against the United
States, but against a policy of the
government of Japan. The people
felt that the issue of the Japanese-
American defense treaty was be
ing pushed through without suf
ficient discussion.

“Our representatives in the Diet
wanted to ratify the treaty rapid
ly, using the pressure of Eisen
hower's impending visit. Such a
significant matter needs consid
erable discussion. Also, I feel as do
many other Japanese, that the
proposed length of time, 10 years,
is too long for which to commit
Japan, considering the great and
rapid changes in the world to
day, and this is another reason we
demonstrated.”

<J. THE PEOPLE of Japan are
obviously highly concerned about
world peace. What do you per
sonally foresee?

A. “There has never been per
fect peace in the world, and there
seems Jitlle reason to believe it is
forthcoming there are many ob
stacles in the way of harmony in
human relations- but the world's
need for peace is so great that we
can’t allow ourselves to give up.
To falter in our efforts is to come
one step closer to atomic war and
utter annihilation.”
Q. What can Japan do to con
tribute to world peace?
A. “She must Jirst of all advo
cate the banning of atomic testing
and adequate inspection to ensure
that the ban is carried out. The
next most important step, and the
only ultimate answer, is eventual
complete disarmament.”
Q. WHAT sort of individual con
tribution can we each make, in
your opinion?
A. “I think that most of the
tensions and hostilities in the
world have been due to fear and
misunderstanding. People are
afraid of the unknown and this
may cause them to strike out in
‘self defense’ when none is needed.
“Then too, the misunderstand
ing can combine with the fear and
cause people to misinterpret
other’s actions. When we antici
pate aggression we are likely to
think we see it before it exists.
“The answer to this problem is
obvious. We must become familiar
with other peoples. I think every
person eager to maintain peace
should study another language
and people.
“WHEN WE do this we find
that people all over the world are

basically the same. This knowl
edge helps us to conquer our ir
rational fears and the way is
opened for sincere relations with
others.”

A. How do the Japanese people
feel about Hiroshima?
A. “I have met none who hold
anything against the United
States for this. They want to be
the only persons who have experi
enced the terror of a nuclear ex
plosion. They want Hiroshima to
serve as a lesson to the world.”
Q. What do you think of the re
cent bomb shelter boom here?
A. "I think it is very silly,
“THE JAPANESE people will
doubtless be the last people in the
world to build them. The nuclear
bombs today are a thousand times
more powerful than the one that
decimated Hiroshima. We can't
hide our heads like ostriches from
such a force. Our only hope is to
concentrate earnestly on securing
world peace."
Q. What do you think of democ
racy as practiced here and in
Japan?
A. “I think that democracy as
practiced in the United States is
very good, and that its fundament
al standards should apply to all
men, but it shouldn’t be imposed
directly on other countries, in
cluding Japan.
“Each country has its own econ
omic, political and social back

ground and modifications are ne
cessary. The concept of a ‘Mani
fest Destiny’ is one that is highly
irritating to Japanese.
“IN GENERAL I approve of the
American policies, but they should
'not be pushed down anyone’s
throat. Russia presents her ideas
quite palatably.
“Her ambassador is a specialist
in the problems of the East.
America’s former ambassador
was not a good one. He angered
many Japanese when he reported
to the U.S. government that the
demonstrations were led and com
posed of Communists.

“This is completely untrue. In
free elections out of 466 seats the
Japanese people elected only one
Communist representative to the
Diet. The present U.S. ambassa
dor is a great improvement. He is
probably the most popular am
bassador to Japan.”

Q. IN A lighter- vein, what do
you think of the Americans you
have met thus far?
A. "Well, the women are much
more outspoken here, which does
not please me. The mothers seem
to lose their tempers more easily
—I have seen them even spank
their children in front of guests.

“This would never be done in
Japan. It sems to me that the
Americans have belter senses of
humor. The Japanese are too
serious much of the time.”

Q. How about Stanford stu
dents?

A. “They are good students;
they study well, but they know
how to enjoy themselves on week
ends too. They are more informal.

“In Japan one would not see his
professor without wearing a suit,
but would relax and wear casual
clothes for a date. Here it seems
to be just the opposite.”

To falter in our efforts is to come
one step closer to atomic war and
utter annihilation.”
Q. What can Japan do to con
tribute to world peace?
A. “She must Jirst of all advo
cate the banning of atomic testing
and adequate inspection to ensure
that the ban is carried out. The
next most important step, and the
only ultimate answer, is eventual
complete disarmament.”
Q. WHAT sort of individual con
tribution can we each make, in
your opinion?
A. “I think that most of the
tensions and hostilities in the
world have been due to fear and
misunderstanding. People are
afraid of the unknown and this
may cause them to strike out in
‘self defense’ when none is needed.
“Then too, the misunderstand
ing can combine with the fear and
cause people to misinterpret
other’s actions. When we antici
pate aggression we are likely to
think we see it before it exists.
“The answer to this problem is
obvious. We must become familiar
with other peoples. I think every
person eager to maintain peace
should study another language
and people.
“WHEN WE do this we find
that people all over the world are

basically the same. This knowl
edge helps us to conquer our ir
rational fears and the way is
opened for sincere relations with
others.”

A. How do the Japanese people
feel about Hiroshima?
A. “I have met none who hold
anything against the United
States for this. They want to be
the only persons who have experi
enced the terror of a nuclear ex
plosion. They want Hiroshima to
serve as a lesson to the world.”
Q. What do you think of the re
cent bomb shelter boom here?
A. "I think it is very silly,
“THE JAPANESE people will
doubtless be the last people in the
world to build them. The nuclear
bombs today are a thousand times
more powerful than the one that
decimated Hiroshima. We can't
hide our heads like ostriches from
such a force. Our only hope is to
concentrate earnestly on securing
world peace."
Q. What do you think of democ
racy as practiced here and in
Japan?
A. “I think that democracy as
practiced in the United States is
very good, and that its fundament
al standards should apply to all
men, but it shouldn’t be imposed
directly on other countries, in
cluding Japan.
“Each country has its own econ
omic, political and social back

ground and modifications are ne
cessary. The concept of a ‘Mani
fest Destiny’ is one that is highly
irritating to Japanese.
“IN GENERAL I approve of the
American policies, but they should
'not be pushed down anyone’s
throat. Russia presents her ideas
quite palatably.
“Her ambassador is a specialist
in the problems of the East.
America’s former ambassador
was not a good one. He angered
many Japanese when he reported
to the U.S. government that the
demonstrations were led and com
posed of Communists.

“This is completely untrue. In
free elections out of 466 seats the
Japanese people elected only one
Communist representative to the
Diet. The present U.S. ambassa
dor is a great improvement. He is
probably the most popular am
bassador to Japan.”

Q. IN A lighter- vein, what do
you think of the Americans you
have met thus far?
A. "Well, the women are much
more outspoken here, which does
not please me. The mothers seem
to lose their tempers more easily
—I have seen them even spank
their children in front of guests.

“This would never be done in
Japan. It sems to me that the
Americans have belter senses of
humor. The Japanese are too
serious much of the time.”

Q. How about Stanford stu
dents?

A. “They are good students;
they study well, but they know
how to enjoy themselves on week
ends too. They are more informal.

“In Japan one would not see his
professor without wearing a suit,
but would relax and wear casual
clothes for a date. Here it seems
to be just the opposite.”


YOSHIHIKO FUJISAWA
ASSU foreign scholar
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
first of a series of articles intro
ducing tills year's ASSU foreign
scholars.)

Yoshihiko Fujisawa is a be
spectacled, serious young man
studying political science at Stan
ford under the ASSU Foreign
Scholarship Program.
He is the son of a retired officer
of the Japanese Imperial Army,
and is an intelligent, good student
with a quick sense of humor.
His good physique (he exorcises
daily), easy coordination and
alertness contribute to one’s im
pression that he is a capable, well
rounded sort of person who does
well in whatever he undertakes.
This writer felt that the “real”
Fuji might best emerge in an in
formal situation, and the follow
ing questions and answers are the
result of an hour-long conversa
tion over a couple of beers.
QUESTION: Fuji, why did you
deside to come to Stanford?
ANSWER: “For two main rea
sons. First, academic. I am inter
ested in Communist China, and
Stanford has the reputation of
having the best resources for
study in this field. Second, I liked
Americans I had met in Japan and
wanted an opportunity to learn
more about them.
“I feel the Second World War
was due in large part to the fact
that most of the communication
between Japan and America in
the period preceding the war was
between (he governments and not
the people.
“Because the people of both na
tions did not know anyone on an
individual basis from the other
country they fell back on stereo
types which are so amenable to
distortion through propaganda,
hence did not actively resist the
gradual descent into war.”
Q. WHY do you wish to study
about Communist China?

A. “China and Japan are closely
connected both geographically
and historically, and in the future
Japan should have some economic
and political ties with China. Of
course, for some time there will
be only economic ties.

“Under the present conditions
we can’t expect too much, but
economic ties will help bring the
nations closer together. Maybe
the political link is not feasible,
but the economic ties would he
valuable, given that Japan first
strengthens her defenses short
of stockpiling nuclear devices
and stabilizes her domestic politi
cal situation.

“I was surprised to find that the
Republican and Democratic par
ties in this country are so similar.
In Japan there are real differ
ences and conflict between the
Liberal Democrats, the Conserva
tive party, the Democratic Social
ist, and Socialist parties.”
<{. WHAT about Japan’s future?
A. “Domestically, I think the
control by the government needs
to be, and will be, expanded. Most
students today in Japan are So
cialists. The government should
control only the productive in
dustries, and of course should
guarantee fundamental human
rights.
“Internationally, Japan is
uniquely suited to play the role of
mediator between East and West,
as she has a foot in both. This will
not be achieved unless she can
play an independent role in the
United Nations free of pressures
from the United States. She must
be allowed to decide her own for
eign policy.”
Q. How about the so-called
“Tokyo Riots”? Why did you take
part?
A. “I would like to emphasize
frist that “riots” and “demonstra
tions” are quite different things.
I took part in the demonstrations.
I saw no riots.
“Several things should be under
stood about these demonstrations.
"First, the Japanese people are
deathly afraid of the outbreak of

atomic war. Better than any other
they know the horror that is pos
sible.

“Second, all the demonstrations
were not against the United
States, but against a policy of the
government of Japan. The people
felt that the issue of the Japanese-
American defense treaty was be
ing pushed through without suf
ficient discussion.

“Our representatives in the Diet
wanted to ratify the treaty rapid
ly, using the pressure of Eisen
hower's impending visit. Such a
significant matter needs consid
erable discussion. Also, I feel as do
many other Japanese, that the
proposed length of time, 10 years,
is too long for which to commit
Japan, considering the great and
rapid changes in the world to
day, and this is another reason we
demonstrated.”

<J. THE PEOPLE of Japan are
obviously highly concerned about
world peace. What do you per
sonally foresee?

A. “There has never been per
fect peace in the world, and there
seems Jitlle reason to believe it is
forthcoming there are many ob
stacles in the way of harmony in
human relations- but the world's
need for peace is so great that we
can’t allow ourselves to give up.
To falter in our efforts is to come
one step closer to atomic war and
utter annihilation.”
Q. What can Japan do to con

This writer felt that the “real”
Fuji might best emerge in an in
formal situation, and the follow
ing questions and answers are the
result of an hour-long conversa
tion over a couple of beers.
QUESTION: Fuji, why did you
deside to come to Stanford?
ANSWER: “For two main rea
sons. First, academic. I am inter
ested in Communist China, and
Stanford has the reputation of
having the best resources for
study in this field. Second, I liked
Americans I had met in Japan and
wanted an opportunity to learn
more about them.
“I feel the Second World War
was due in large part to the fact
that most of the communication
between Japan and America in
the period preceding the war was
between (he governments and not
the people.
“Because the people of both na
tions did not know anyone on an
individual basis from the other
country they fell back on stereo
types which are so amenable to
distortion through propaganda,
hence did not actively resist the
gradual descent into war.”
Q. WHY do you wish to study
about Communist China?

A. “China and Japan are closely
connected both geographically
and historically, and in the future
Japan should have some economic
and political ties with China. Of
course, for some time there will
be only economic ties.

“Under the present conditions
we can’t expect too much, but
economic ties will help bring the
nations closer together. Maybe
the political link is not feasible,
but the economic ties would he
valuable, given that Japan first
strengthens her defenses short
of stockpiling nuclear devices
and stabilizes her domestic politi
cal situation.

“I was surprised to find that the
Republican and Democratic par
ties in this country are so similar.
In Japan there are real differ
ences and conflict between the
Liberal Democrats, the Conserva
tive party, the Democratic Social
ist, and Socialist parties.”
<{. WHAT about Japan’s future?
A. “Domestically, I think the
control by the government needs
to be, and will be, expanded. Most
students today in Japan are So
cialists. The government should
control only the productive in
dustries, and of course should
guarantee fundamental human
rights.
“Internationally, Japan is
uniquely suited to play the role of
mediator between East and West,
as she has a foot in both. This will
not be achieved unless she can
play an independent role in the
United Nations free of pressures
from the United States. She must
be allowed to decide her own for
eign policy.”
Q. How about the so-called
“Tokyo Riots”? Why did you take
part?
A. “I would like to emphasize
frist that “riots” and “demonstra
tions” are quite different things.
I took part in the demonstrations.
I saw no riots.
“Several things should be under
stood about these demonstrations.
"First, the Japanese people are
deathly afraid of the outbreak of

atomic war. Better than any other
they know the horror that is pos
sible.

“Second, all the demonstrations
were not against the United
States, but against a policy of the
government of Japan. The people
felt that the issue of the Japanese-
American defense treaty was be
ing pushed through without suf
ficient discussion.

“Our representatives in the Diet
wanted to ratify the treaty rapid
ly, using the pressure of Eisen
hower's impending visit. Such a
significant matter needs consid
erable discussion. Also, I feel as do
many other Japanese, that the
proposed length of time, 10 years,
is too long for which to commit
Japan, considering the great and
rapid changes in the world to
day, and this is another reason we
demonstrated.”

<J. THE PEOPLE of Japan are
obviously highly concerned about
world peace. What do you per
sonally foresee?

A. “There has never been per
fect peace in the world, and there
seems Jitlle reason to believe it is
forthcoming there are many ob
stacles in the way of harmony in
human relations- but the world's
need for peace is so great that we
can’t allow ourselves to give up.
To falter in our efforts is to come
one step closer to atomic war and
utter annihilation.”
Q. What can Japan do to con
tribute to world peace?
A. “She must Jirst of all advo
cate the banning of atomic testing
and adequate inspection to ensure
that the ban is carried out. The
next most important step, and the
only ultimate answer, is eventual
complete disarmament.”
Q. WHAT sort of individual con
tribution can we each make, in
your opinion?
A. “I think that most of the
tensions and hostilities in the
world have been due to fear and
misunderstanding. People are
afraid of the unknown and this
may cause them to strike out in
‘self defense’ when none is needed.
“Then too, the misunderstand
ing can combine with the fear and
cause people to misinterpret
other’s actions. When we antici
pate aggression we are likely to
think we see it before it exists.
“The answer to this problem is
obvious. We must become familiar
with other peoples. I think every
person eager to maintain peace
should study another language
and people.
“WHEN WE do this we find
that people all over the world are

basically the same. This knowl
edge helps us to conquer our ir
rational fears and the way is
opened for sincere relations with
others.”

A. How do the Japanese people
feel about Hiroshima?
A. “I have met none who hold
anything against the United
States for this. They want to be
the only persons who have experi
enced the terror of a nuclear ex
plosion. They want Hiroshima to
serve as a lesson to the world.”
Q. What do you think of the re
cent bomb shelter boom here?
A. "I think it is very silly,
“THE JAPANESE people will
doubtless be the last people in the
world to build them. The nuclear
bombs today are a thousand times
more powerful than the one that
decimated Hiroshima. We can't
hide our heads like ostriches from
such a force. Our only hope is to
concentrate earnestly on securing
world peace."
Q. What do you think of democ
racy as practiced here and in
Japan?
A. “I think that democracy as
practiced in the United States is
very good, and that its fundament
al standards should apply to all
men, but it shouldn’t be imposed
directly on other countries, in
cluding Japan.
“Each country has its own econ
omic, political and social back

ground and modifications are ne
cessary. The concept of a ‘Mani
fest Destiny’ is one that is highly
irritating to Japanese.
“IN GENERAL I approve of the
American policies, but they should
'not be pushed down anyone’s
throat. Russia presents her ideas
quite palatably.
“Her ambassador is a specialist
in the problems of the East.
America’s former ambassador
was not a good one. He angered
many Japanese when he reported
to the U.S. government that the
demonstrations were led and com
posed of Communists.

“This is completely untrue. In
free elections out of 466 seats the
Japanese people elected only one
Communist representative to the
Diet. The present U.S. ambassa
dor is a great improvement. He is
probably the most popular am
bassador to Japan.”

Q. IN A lighter- vein, what do
you think of the Americans you
have met thus far?
A. "Well, the women are much
more outspoken here, which does
not please me. The mothers seem
to lose their tempers more easily
—I have seen them even spank
their children in front of guests.

“This would never be done in
Japan. It sems to me that the
Americans have belter senses of
humor. The Japanese are too
serious much of the time.”

Q. How about Stanford stu
dents?

A. “They are good students;
they study well, but they know
how to enjoy themselves on week
ends too. They are more informal.

“In Japan one would not see his
professor without wearing a suit,
but would relax and wear casual
clothes for a date. Here it seems
to be just the opposite.”

“Then too, the misunderstand
ing can combine with the fear and
cause people to misinterpret
other’s actions. When we antici
pate aggression we are likely to
think we see it before it exists.
“The answer to this problem is
obvious. We must become familiar
with other peoples. I think every
person eager to maintain peace
should study another language
and people.
“WHEN WE do this we find
that people all over the world are

basically the same. This knowl
edge helps us to conquer our ir
rational fears and the way is
opened for sincere relations with
others.”

A. How do the Japanese people
feel about Hiroshima?
A. “I have met none who hold
anything against the United
States for this. They want to be
the only persons who have experi
enced the terror of a nuclear ex
plosion. They want Hiroshima to
serve as a lesson to the world.”
Q. What do you think of the re
cent bomb shelter boom here?
A. "I think it is very silly,
“THE JAPANESE people will
doubtless be the last people in the
world to build them. The nuclear
bombs today are a thousand times
more powerful than the one that
decimated Hiroshima. We can't
hide our heads like ostriches from
such a force. Our only hope is to
concentrate earnestly on securing
world peace."
Q. What do you think of democ
racy as practiced here and in
Japan?
A. “I think that democracy as
practiced in the United States is
very good, and that its fundament
al standards should apply to all
men, but it shouldn’t be imposed
directly on other countries, in
cluding Japan.
“Each country has its own econ
omic, political and social back

ground and modifications are ne
cessary. The concept of a ‘Mani
fest Destiny’ is one that is highly
irritating to Japanese.
“IN GENERAL I approve of the
American policies, but they should
'not be pushed down anyone’s
throat. Russia presents her ideas
quite palatably.
“Her ambassador is a specialist
in the problems of the East.
America’s former ambassador
was not a good one. He angered
many Japanese when he reported
to the U.S. government that the
demonstrations were led and com
posed of Communists.

“This is completely untrue. In
free elections out of 466 seats the
Japanese people elected only one
Communist representative to the
Diet. The present U.S. ambassa
dor is a great improvement. He is
probably the most popular am
bassador to Japan.”

Q. IN A lighter- vein, what do
you think of the Americans you
have met thus far?
A. "Well, the women are much
more outspoken here, which does
not please me. The mothers seem
to lose their tempers more easily
—I have seen them even spank
their children in front of guests.

“This would never be done in
Japan. It sems to me that the
Americans have belter senses of
humor. The Japanese are too
serious much of the time.”

Q. How about Stanford stu
dents?

A. “They are good students;
they study well, but they know
how to enjoy themselves on week
ends too. They are more informal.

“In Japan one would not see his
professor without wearing a suit,
but would relax and wear casual
clothes for a date. Here it seems
to be just the opposite.”


YOSHIHIKO FUJISAWA
ASSU foreign scholar
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
first of a series of articles intro
ducing tills year's ASSU foreign
scholars.)

Yoshihiko Fujisawa is a be
spectacled, serious young man
studying political science at Stan
ford under the ASSU Foreign
Scholarship Program.
He is the son of a retired officer
of the Japanese Imperial Army,
and is an intelligent, good student
with a quick sense of humor.
His good physique (he exorcises
daily), easy coordination and
alertness contribute to one’s im
pression that he is a capable, well
rounded sort of person who does
well in whatever he undertakes.
This writer felt that the “real”
Fuji might best emerge in an in
formal situation, and the follow
ing questions and answers are the
result of an hour-long conversa
tion over a couple of beers.
QUESTION: Fuji, why did you
deside to come to Stanford?
ANSWER: “For two main rea
sons. First, academic. I am inter
ested in Communist China, and
Stanford has the reputation of
having the best resources for
study in this field. Second, I liked
Americans I had met in Japan and
wanted an opportunity to learn
more about them.
“I feel the Second World War
was due in large part to the fact
that most of the communication
between Japan and America in
the period preceding the war was
between (he governments and not
the people.
“Because the people of both na
tions did not know anyone on an
individual basis from the other
country they fell back on stereo
types which are so amenable to
distortion through propaganda,
hence did not actively resist the
gradual descent into war.”
Q. WHY do you wish to study
about Communist China?

A. “China and Japan are closely
connected both geographically
and historically, and in the future
Japan should have some economic
and political ties with China. Of
course, for some time there will
be only economic ties.

“Under the present conditions
we can’t expect too much, but
economic ties will help bring the
nations closer together. Maybe
the political link is not feasible,
but the economic ties would he
valuable, given that Japan first
strengthens her defenses short
of stockpiling nuclear devices
and stabilizes her domestic politi
cal situation.

“I was surprised to find that the
Republican and Democratic par
ties in this country are so similar.
In Japan there are real differ
ences and conflict between the
Liberal Democrats, the Conserva
tive party, the Democratic Social
ist, and Socialist parties.”
<{. WHAT about Japan’s future?
A. “Domestically, I think the
control by the government needs
to be, and will be, expanded. Most
students today in Japan are So
cialists. The government should
control only the productive in
dustries, and of course should
guarantee fundamental human
rights.
“Internationally, Japan is
uniquely suited to play the role of
mediator between East and West,
as she has a foot in both. This will
not be achieved unless she can
play an independent role in the
United Nations free of pressures
from the United States. She must
be allowed to decide her own for
eign policy.”
Q. How about the so-called
“Tokyo Riots”? Why did you take
part?
A. “I would like to emphasize
frist that “riots” and “demonstra
tions” are quite different things.
I took part in the demonstrations.
I saw no riots.
“Several things should be under
stood about these demonstrations.
"First, the Japanese people are
deathly afraid of the outbreak of

atomic war. Better than any other
they know the horror that is pos
sible.

“Second, all the demonstrations
were not against the United
States, but against a policy of the
government of Japan. The people
felt that the issue of the Japanese-
American defense treaty was be
ing pushed through without suf
ficient discussion.

“Our representatives in the Diet
wanted to ratify the treaty rapid
ly, using the pressure of Eisen
hower's impending visit. Such a
significant matter needs consid
erable discussion. Also, I feel as do
many other Japanese, that the
proposed length of time, 10 years,
is too long for which to commit
Japan, considering the great and
rapid changes in the world to
day, and this is another reason we
demonstrated.”

<J. THE PEOPLE of Japan are
obviously highly concerned about
world peace. What do you per
sonally foresee?

A. “There has never been per
fect peace in the world, and there
seems Jitlle reason to believe it is
forthcoming there are many ob
stacles in the way of harmony in
human relations- but the world's
need for peace is so great that we
can’t allow ourselves to give up.
To falter in our efforts is to come
one step closer to atomic war and
utter annihilation.”
Q. What can Japan do to con
tribute to world peace?
A. “She must Jirst of all advo
cate the banning of atomic testing
and adequate inspection to ensure
that the ban is carried out. The
next most important step, and the
only ultimate answer, is eventual
complete disarmament.”
Q. WHAT sort of individual con
tribution can we each make, in
your opinion?
A. “I think that most of the
tensions and hostilities in the
world have been due to fear and
misunderstanding. People are
afraid of the unknown and this
may cause them to strike out in
‘self defense’ when none is needed.
“Then too, the misunderstand
ing can combine with the fear and
cause people to misinterpret
other’s actions. When we antici
pate aggression we are likely to

the period preceding the war was
between (he governments and not
the people.
“Because the people of both na
tions did not know anyone on an
individual basis from the other
country they fell back on stereo
types which are so amenable to
distortion through propaganda,
hence did not actively resist the
gradual descent into war.”
Q. WHY do you wish to study
about Communist China?

A. “China and Japan are closely
connected both geographically
and historically, and in the future
Japan should have some economic
and political ties with China. Of
course, for some time there will
be only economic ties.

“Under the present conditions
we can’t expect too much, but
economic ties will help bring the
nations closer together. Maybe
the political link is not feasible,
but the economic ties would he
valuable, given that Japan first
strengthens her defenses short
of stockpiling nuclear devices
and stabilizes her domestic politi
cal situation.

“I was surprised to find that the
Republican and Democratic par
ties in this country are so similar.
In Japan there are real differ
ences and conflict between the
Liberal Democrats, the Conserva
tive party, the Democratic Social
ist, and Socialist parties.”
<{. WHAT about Japan’s future?
A. “Domestically, I think the
control by the government needs
to be, and will be, expanded. Most
students today in Japan are So
cialists. The government should
control only the productive in
dustries, and of course should
guarantee fundamental human
rights.
“Internationally, Japan is
uniquely suited to play the role of
mediator between East and West,
as she has a foot in both. This will
not be achieved unless she can
play an independent role in the
United Nations free of pressures
from the United States. She must
be allowed to decide her own for
eign policy.”
Q. How about the so-called
“Tokyo Riots”? Why did you take
part?
A. “I would like to emphasize
frist that “riots” and “demonstra
tions” are quite different things.
I took part in the demonstrations.
I saw no riots.
“Several things should be under
stood about these demonstrations.
"First, the Japanese people are
deathly afraid of the outbreak of

atomic war. Better than any other
they know the horror that is pos
sible.

“Second, all the demonstrations
were not against the United
States, but against a policy of the
government of Japan. The people
felt that the issue of the Japanese-
American defense treaty was be
ing pushed through without suf
ficient discussion.

“Our representatives in the Diet
wanted to ratify the treaty rapid
ly, using the pressure of Eisen
hower's impending visit. Such a
significant matter needs consid
erable discussion. Also, I feel as do
many other Japanese, that the
proposed length of time, 10 years,
is too long for which to commit
Japan, considering the great and
rapid changes in the world to
day, and this is another reason we
demonstrated.”

<J. THE PEOPLE of Japan are
obviously highly concerned about
world peace. What do you per
sonally foresee?

A. “There has never been per
fect peace in the world, and there
seems Jitlle reason to believe it is
forthcoming there are many ob
stacles in the way of harmony in
human relations- but the world's
need for peace is so great that we
can’t allow ourselves to give up.
To falter in our efforts is to come
one step closer to atomic war and
utter annihilation.”
Q. What can Japan do to con
tribute to world peace?
A. “She must Jirst of all advo
cate the banning of atomic testing
and adequate inspection to ensure
that the ban is carried out. The
next most important step, and the
only ultimate answer, is eventual
complete disarmament.”
Q. WHAT sort of individual con
tribution can we each make, in
your opinion?
A. “I think that most of the
tensions and hostilities in the
world have been due to fear and
misunderstanding. People are
afraid of the unknown and this
may cause them to strike out in
‘self defense’ when none is needed.
“Then too, the misunderstand
ing can combine with the fear and
cause people to misinterpret
other’s actions. When we antici
pate aggression we are likely to
think we see it before it exists.
“The answer to this problem is
obvious. We must become familiar
with other peoples. I think every
person eager to maintain peace
should study another language
and people.
“WHEN WE do this we find
that people all over the world are

basically the same. This knowl
edge helps us to conquer our ir
rational fears and the way is
opened for sincere relations with
others.”

A. How do the Japanese people
feel about Hiroshima?
A. “I have met none who hold
anything against the United
States for this. They want to be
the only persons who have experi
enced the terror of a nuclear ex
plosion. They want Hiroshima to
serve as a lesson to the world.”
Q. What do you think of the re
cent bomb shelter boom here?
A. "I think it is very silly,
“THE JAPANESE people will
doubtless be the last people in the
world to build them. The nuclear
bombs today are a thousand times
more powerful than the one that
decimated Hiroshima. We can't
hide our heads like ostriches from
such a force. Our only hope is to
concentrate earnestly on securing
world peace."
Q. What do you think of democ
racy as practiced here and in
Japan?
A. “I think that democracy as
practiced in the United States is
very good, and that its fundament
al standards should apply to all
men, but it shouldn’t be imposed
directly on other countries, in
cluding Japan.
“Each country has its own econ
omic, political and social back

ground and modifications are ne
cessary. The concept of a ‘Mani
fest Destiny’ is one that is highly
irritating to Japanese.
“IN GENERAL I approve of the
American policies, but they should
'not be pushed down anyone’s
throat. Russia presents her ideas
quite palatably.
“Her ambassador is a specialist
in the problems of the East.
America’s former ambassador
was not a good one. He angered
many Japanese when he reported
to the U.S. government that the
demonstrations were led and com
posed of Communists.

“This is completely untrue. In
free elections out of 466 seats the
Japanese people elected only one
Communist representative to the
Diet. The present U.S. ambassa
dor is a great improvement. He is
probably the most popular am
bassador to Japan.”

Q. IN A lighter- vein, what do
you think of the Americans you
have met thus far?
A. "Well, the women are much
more outspoken here, which does
not please me. The mothers seem
to lose their tempers more easily
—I have seen them even spank
their children in front of guests.

“This would never be done in
Japan. It sems to me that the
Americans have belter senses of
humor. The Japanese are too
serious much of the time.”

Q. How about Stanford stu
dents?

A. “They are good students;
they study well, but they know
how to enjoy themselves on week
ends too. They are more informal.

“In Japan one would not see his
professor without wearing a suit,
but would relax and wear casual
clothes for a date. Here it seems
to be just the opposite.”

ducing tills year's ASSU foreign
scholars.)

Yoshihiko Fujisawa is a be
spectacled, serious young man
studying political science at Stan
ford under the ASSU Foreign
Scholarship Program.
He is the son of a retired officer
of the Japanese Imperial Army,
and is an intelligent, good student
with a quick sense of humor.
His good physique (he exorcises
daily), easy coordination and
alertness contribute to one’s im
pression that he is a capable, well
rounded sort of person who does
well in whatever he undertakes.
This writer felt that the “real”
Fuji might best emerge in an in
formal situation, and the follow
ing questions and answers are the
result of an hour-long conversa
tion over a couple of beers.
QUESTION: Fuji, why did you
deside to come to Stanford?
ANSWER: “For two main rea
sons. First, academic. I am inter

Stanford has the reputation of
