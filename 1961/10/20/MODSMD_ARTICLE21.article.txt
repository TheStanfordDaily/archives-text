PACIFISM
Editor, The Daily:
I knew it would happen sooner
or later, and now it has. One of
Stanford’s fuzzy minds has “crys
talized.” I couldn’t tell what Gene
Hunn, in his letter in the Oct. 18
issue, was more concerned about
his own safety or the true good
in Mr. Khrushchev’s plan to estab
lish world communism through
some sort of peaceful negotia
tions.
I will answer Hunn’s question.
“How can America exist if human
civilization no longer exists,” with
another question directed at him
and anyone else who agrees with

his philosophy. What do you
mean by “exist”? To live in a so
ciety which is dead to the idea of
moral responsibility, a society
which has as its one ideal—sub
mission?

The America you want is a na
lion which would sell the bodies
and souls of generations yet un
born, Is there anything good or
admirable in that? What man
would leave his sons and daugh
ters with but one thing to look
forward to a place in a stagnant
and ever rotting human society
which is afraid to think, much
less do. Sell yourself, Mr. Hunn,
not us. Hubert .lames Wyatt
