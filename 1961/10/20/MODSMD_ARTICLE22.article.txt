# MITCHELL'S PREP TEAMMATE
## Tim Hansel Heads Home For First Varsity Game 
### 
Tho rash of had luck that has
beset oft-injured Stanford wing
back, Tim Hansel, may have dis
appeared. And just in time.
Just in time for the Indians and
just in time for Hansel.
The lanky ball carrier is flying
to Seattle today to appear against
Washington in his first game of
the year, and the fact that it’s
against the Huskies means some
thing a little special to Hansel.
Hansel, who was knocked out
of action only a few clays before
the season opener, is from Seattle
and may therefore be pardoned
for showing extra exuberance at
opening his own particular sea
son against Washington.
But there will be more than one
reunion for Hansel, who didn’t
see much action last year because
of a dislocated shoulder.
After saying hello to his family
and friends off the field, Hansel
will renew an acquaintance with
a different type of individual.
He is Charlie Mitchell, a half
back who is about tho best player
the Huskies have these days.
Mitchell and Hansel played for
Seattle’s Garfield High. And while
Hansel has been living the life of
the injured lately, Mitchell has
been running like a madman.
Hansel now gets his chance to
even things up in a hurry.


HARD LUCK BOY TIM HANSEL
The Card halfback from Seattle will be playing his first game of
the season and is determined to show his ability to the home folks.
