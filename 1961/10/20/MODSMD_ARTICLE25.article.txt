# Young Card Harriers to Battle Potent SJS In Four Team Meet
## 
### 
A real "Battle of Giants’’ is in
store tomorrow at 10 a.m. in Ber
keley when the Stanford cross
country team competes in a four
way meet with Cal, San Jose
State and USC. The seven-man
Indian squad, the best in years,
will face a San Jose ream that is

rated as one of the best on the
coast.

Stanford’s outstanding team in
cludes five freshmen. Harlan An
drews, John Beck, Weym Kirk
land, Paul Schllcke and Dave
Steinbeck will run for the Cards
in addition to sophomore Bill
Pratt and senior John Northway.
This lineup, except for Beck, is
the same team that trounced Cal
in the Sacramento State Invita
tional meet last Saturday.

THE SPARTANS boast four
returning lettermen in Charlie
Clark. Ron Davis, Bon Tucker, and
Horace Whitehead. Other San
Jose threats are Jeff Fishback,
transfer from San Mateo JC who
won the JC stale championship
880 last year, and Danny Murphy,
from Mira Costa High School.
The Cal team, although beaten
by Stanford, is still an unknown
quantity, since it is possible that
■some of the top Bear competitors
did not enter the last meet. Stan
ford coach Payton Jordan sus
pects that the Bears could be
stronger for this meet.
Southern Cal’s cross country
entry doesn’t look to be especially
strong this year, although Jordan
emphasizes that USC can never
be considered a pushover.
THE MEET’S real battle will be
between San Jose and Stanford.
Both are well-balanced teams, the
Spartans having experience, the
Indians youth and fine ability.
The quality of this year’s fresh
man is shown by the fact that
only two of last year’s returning

lettermen could make the squad.
Sohlicke is number one on the
team and Kirkland number two.
It takes more than individual
speed to win a team cross country
meet, and that’s one of the rea
sons why coach Jordan is opti
mistic. “They know how to run
as a team, and not just as in
dividuals,” said Jordan.
