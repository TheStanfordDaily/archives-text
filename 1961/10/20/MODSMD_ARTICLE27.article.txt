Edged 13-12. in Ihoir opener
against USC, Coach Dan Stavely’s
frosh gridders seek to even their
seoson’s record, at home against
San Jose, tomorrow morning.
The defense and the line, which
Stavely had expected to lack the
depth of previous years, did
quite well against the Trojan
frosh, although no one player was
outstanding. Starting linemen for
tomorrow’s game are Guy Roun
seville and Bob Howard, ends,
John Wilken and John Wilbur,
tackles, Joe Neal and Jack Chap
pel, guards, and Stan Tarter, cen
ter. Duke Samson and Terry Cas
saday will alternate with Tarter
at center.
Dick Ragsdale, a good running
quarterback, is starting at the po
sition against San Jose. However,
Steve Berg, who scored the second
Indian touchdown last week, is
also expected to see action. Berg
is regarded as the belter passer of
the two. Starting halfbacks Mor
rison Warren, a converted end and

the fastest boy on the squad, and
Mark Rosen, with Rath starting
at fullback.
The final game of the short
frosh season is Nov. -i, against Cal
at Berkeley.
