# Stanford Gridders Meet Huskies
## Indians Shoot For First Win In AAWU Play 
### ROY SCHMIDT Sports Editor 
Dally Sports Editor Roy
Schmidt will accompany the team
to Seattle to cover the Slant'ord-
Washington game. His account
will appear in IVlonday’s Daily.

With a juggled lineup, a lot of
adhesive tape and a good rain
coat, Stanford’s surprising foot
ball team journies north to Wash
ington in pursuit of its fourth vic
tory of the year and the first in
Big Five play.
The Indians, now sporting the
cleanest record on the coast at 3-1,
will be getting their first crack at
an AAWU team. They are again
picked as an also-ran, being given
a six-point handicap by the sports
writers.
COACH JACK CURTICE will
continue his “troika” system of
alternating quarterbacks, this
time giving the nod to senior Rod
Sears. As Cactus Jack explains it,
“I used all three against Tulane
and it was Chuck Butler who pro
vided the winning touchdown. I
used all three against Oregon
State and Sears starred. I used
three against Michigan State and
it was the Spartans who had the
fine day. I used them all against
San Jose State and it was Thur
low’s turn to spark the team.”
Sears still has the best arm on
the club, statistic-wise anyway.
He has completed 16 of 32 for 158

yards.
But, should it be raining in Se
attle, not an uncommon phenome
non for the Pacific Northwest,
Sears would probably yield to
sophomore Steve Thurlow, the
best running back of the three.
THURLOW worked the option
to perfection against San Jose
State picking up 75 yards in 12
carries.
At halfback the Cards are dan
gerously thin with Larry Royse
out of action. Curtice has shifted
Jim Smith, the number four quar
ter back, to left half, and the tal
ented senior has taken to his new
spot easily. He will see a lot of
action against the Huskies.
Gary Craig and Danny Spence
get the starting assignments at
the halts. Craig has been one of
the most consistent cogs in the
Stanford offense and is as fine
a defensive back as the Cards have
had for a couple of years.
SPENCE, a sophomore in eli
gibility, started his first game at
right half last week and sparked
one Stanford touchdown drive
with a 44-yard run around left
end. That, incidentally, was the
longest run from scrimmage this
year.
At fullback, the Cards are hurt
ing even more with Ed Cummings
and Tony DeLellis sharing the
duties. Regular Hal Steuber has
been out for two weeks with a
broken jaw, and little Ken Baba
jian will miss the trip with a hip
point.
Up front another sophomore
has been added to an already
green line. A1 Hildebrand will
open at left tackle in place of
Frank Atkinson, who is still fa
voring an injured knee. Atkinson
will make the trip and will prob
ably be used in spots by the Card
coaching staff.
ANOTHER SOPH, Frank Du
bofsky, will again open at right
guard in place of Errol Scott, who
cracked a rib two weeks ago. Scott
has been named as one of the co
captains and will probably share
time equally with Dubofsky.
Steve Pursell is still having
trouble with a severely sprained
instep and will probably not get
into the game. Pursell’s spot will
again be taken by Frank Patitucci,
a youngster who was voted line
man of the week for Northern
California in his first varsity
start.

The remainder of the lineup
will be the same with George Hon
ore at right end, C. B. Simons at
right tackle, Tom Walsh at left
guard, and Chris Cottle at center.


END FRANK PATITUCCI
Named Northern California Lineman of the Week last week by the
Northern California Sportswriters Association, Patitucci will be try
ing to equal his performance against the Huskies tomorrow.


SPEEDY CHARLIE MITCHELL
The fleet Washington halfback's injuries have healed and he will
give the Indian ground defense a good workout. Mitchell is always

guard in place of Errol Scott, who

instep and will probably not get

right tackle, Tom Walsh at left

Named Northern California Lineman of the Week last week by the

SPEEDY CHARLIE MITCHELL
The fleet Washington halfback's injuries have healed and he will
give the Indian ground defense a good workout. Mitchell is always
a breakaway threat.
Dally Sports Editor Roy
Schmidt will accompany the team
to Seattle to cover the Slant'ord-
Washington game. His account
will appear in IVlonday’s Daily.

With a juggled lineup, a lot of
adhesive tape and a good rain
coat, Stanford’s surprising foot
ball team journies north to Wash
ington in pursuit of its fourth vic
tory of the year and the first in
Big Five play.
The Indians, now sporting the
cleanest record on the coast at 3-1,
will be getting their first crack at
an AAWU team. They are again
picked as an also-ran, being given
a six-point handicap by the sports
writers.
COACH JACK CURTICE will
continue his “troika” system of
alternating quarterbacks, this
time giving the nod to senior Rod
Sears. As Cactus Jack explains it,
“I used all three against Tulane
and it was Chuck Butler who pro
vided the winning touchdown. I
used all three against Oregon
State and Sears starred. I used
three against Michigan State and
it was the Spartans who had the
fine day. I used them all against
San Jose State and it was Thur
low’s turn to spark the team.”
Sears still has the best arm on
the club, statistic-wise anyway.
He has completed 16 of 32 for 158

yards.
But, should it be raining in Se
attle, not an uncommon phenome
non for the Pacific Northwest,
Sears would probably yield to
sophomore Steve Thurlow, the
best running back of the three.
THURLOW worked the option
to perfection against San Jose
State picking up 75 yards in 12
carries.
At halfback the Cards are dan
gerously thin with Larry Royse
out of action. Curtice has shifted
Jim Smith, the number four quar
ter back, to left half, and the tal
ented senior has taken to his new
spot easily. He will see a lot of
action against the Huskies.
Gary Craig and Danny Spence
get the starting assignments at
the halts. Craig has been one of
the most consistent cogs in the
Stanford offense and is as fine
a defensive back as the Cards have
had for a couple of years.
SPENCE, a sophomore in eli
gibility, started his first game at
right half last week and sparked
one Stanford touchdown drive
with a 44-yard run around left
end. That, incidentally, was the
longest run from scrimmage this
year.
At fullback, the Cards are hurt
ing even more with Ed Cummings
and Tony DeLellis sharing the
duties. Regular Hal Steuber has
been out for two weeks with a
broken jaw, and little Ken Baba
jian will miss the trip with a hip
point.
Up front another sophomore
has been added to an already
green line. A1 Hildebrand will
open at left tackle in place of
Frank Atkinson, who is still fa
voring an injured knee. Atkinson
will make the trip and will prob
ably be used in spots by the Card
coaching staff.
ANOTHER SOPH, Frank Du
bofsky, will again open at right

a defensive back as the Cards have
had for a couple of years.
SPENCE, a sophomore in eli
gibility, started his first game at
right half last week and sparked
one Stanford touchdown drive
with a 44-yard run around left
end. That, incidentally, was the
longest run from scrimmage this
year.
At fullback, the Cards are hurt
ing even more with Ed Cummings
and Tony DeLellis sharing the
duties. Regular Hal Steuber has
been out for two weeks with a
broken jaw, and little Ken Baba
jian will miss the trip with a hip
point.
Up front another sophomore
has been added to an already
green line. A1 Hildebrand will
open at left tackle in place of
Frank Atkinson, who is still fa
voring an injured knee. Atkinson
will make the trip and will prob
ably be used in spots by the Card
coaching staff.
ANOTHER SOPH, Frank Du
bofsky, will again open at right
guard in place of Errol Scott, who
cracked a rib two weeks ago. Scott
has been named as one of the co
captains and will probably share
time equally with Dubofsky.
Steve Pursell is still having
trouble with a severely sprained
instep and will probably not get
into the game. Pursell’s spot will
again be taken by Frank Patitucci,
a youngster who was voted line
man of the week for Northern
California in his first varsity
start.

The remainder of the lineup
will be the same with George Hon
ore at right end, C. B. Simons at
right tackle, Tom Walsh at left
guard, and Chris Cottle at center.


END FRANK PATITUCCI
Named Northern California Lineman of the Week last week by the
Northern California Sportswriters Association, Patitucci will be try
ing to equal his performance against the Huskies tomorrow.


SPEEDY CHARLIE MITCHELL
The fleet Washington halfback's injuries have healed and he will
give the Indian ground defense a good workout. Mitchell is always
a breakaway threat.
Dally Sports Editor Roy
Schmidt will accompany the team
to Seattle to cover the Slant'ord-
Washington game. His account
will appear in IVlonday’s Daily.

With a juggled lineup, a lot of
adhesive tape and a good rain
coat, Stanford’s surprising foot
ball team journies north to Wash
ington in pursuit of its fourth vic
tory of the year and the first in
Big Five play.
The Indians, now sporting the
cleanest record on the coast at 3-1,
will be getting their first crack at
an AAWU team. They are again
picked as an also-ran, being given
a six-point handicap by the sports
writers.
COACH JACK CURTICE will
continue his “troika” system of
alternating quarterbacks, this
time giving the nod to senior Rod
Sears. As Cactus Jack explains it,
“I used all three against Tulane
and it was Chuck Butler who pro
vided the winning touchdown. I
used all three against Oregon
State and Sears starred. I used
three against Michigan State and
it was the Spartans who had the
fine day. I used them all against
San Jose State and it was Thur
low’s turn to spark the team.”
Sears still has the best arm on
the club, statistic-wise anyway.
He has completed 16 of 32 for 158

yards.
But, should it be raining in Se
attle, not an uncommon phenome
non for the Pacific Northwest,
Sears would probably yield to
sophomore Steve Thurlow, the
best running back of the three.
THURLOW worked the option
to perfection against San Jose
State picking up 75 yards in 12
carries.
At halfback the Cards are dan
gerously thin with Larry Royse
out of action. Curtice has shifted
Jim Smith, the number four quar
ter back, to left half, and the tal
ented senior has taken to his new
spot easily. He will see a lot of
action against the Huskies.
Gary Craig and Danny Spence
get the starting assignments at
the halts. Craig has been one of
the most consistent cogs in the
Stanford offense and is as fine
a defensive back as the Cards have
had for a couple of years.
