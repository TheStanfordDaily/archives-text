# Thin Tribe Soccer Team Will Meet Cal Aggies
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The Stanford soccer squad
hopes to regain its winning ways
against the Cal Aggies, in a game
that will be played tomorrow at
Davis.
Stanford has been riddled by
ineligibilities, injury, and aban
donment.
Three starters and three ca
pable substitutes have been de
clared ineligible due to reasons
ranging from NCAA rules to aca
demic deficiencies.
EMMANUEL ANDAH, Stan
ford’s top scoring threat, and per
haps the most dangerous soccer
player in the league, is a doubt
ful starter. He entered the hospi
tal last week and had to miss last
week’s game with San Jose State.
A doctor will have to rule whether
he can play this week.
Beau Bianchi, starting goalie
for all last season and most of

this one. has presumably quit the
team since no one has heard from
him in over a week.
Hunt Bascom, starting goalie
against San Jose, turned in the
best job by a Stanford goalie in
several years last week. However,
other commitments may keep
him out of the lineup tomorrow.
Aside from these little difficul
ties, Stanford will be at top
strength against the Aggies.
DAVE DIERDORFF may get
the call at goalie by default. Full
backs are Rich Loncrgan, a tal
ented sophomore, and Edgar Ber
ner, a former starting center half
who was switched to the deeper
backfield position when all-con
ference fullback Dan Farthing
was declared ineligible.
Wing halfbacks will be Bill
Hatch, also former center half,
who was switched to take up the
slack caused by Rune Engebrett
sen’s ineligibility, and Rusty Wil
liams, the best defensive back on
the club. Williams turned in an
outstanding game against San
Jose.
Don Burr, getting better and
better with more work, is the
starting center half.
The front line goes: Ed Clarke,
Albert Nnoli, Andah, Larry Chuk
wudbe, and Mike Tippett. Mike
Ero will start in Andah’s place
if the speedy Ethiopian cannot
get the doctor’s OK to play. If
Andah does play, Ero will split
duties on the wing with Clarke.
DEFENSIVE BACK Sandy Po
fahl and forward Sam Edwards
also will see plenty of action.
Stanford coach Fred Priddle
has sharpened up the defensive
game with a few new wrinkles.
His plans include luring the Ag
gies off-side and making them
take the long, looping shots which
Dierdorff is adept at defending
against.

was declared ineligible.
Wing halfbacks will be Bill
Hatch, also former center half,
who was switched to take up the
slack caused by Rune Engebrett
sen’s ineligibility, and Rusty Wil
liams, the best defensive back on
the club. Williams turned in an
outstanding game against San
Jose.
Don Burr, getting better and
better with more work, is the
starting center half.
The front line goes: Ed Clarke,
Albert Nnoli, Andah, Larry Chuk
wudbe, and Mike Tippett. Mike
Ero will start in Andah’s place
if the speedy Ethiopian cannot
get the doctor’s OK to play. If
Andah does play, Ero will split
duties on the wing with Clarke.
DEFENSIVE BACK Sandy Po
fahl and forward Sam Edwards
also will see plenty of action.
Stanford coach Fred Priddle
has sharpened up the defensive
game with a few new wrinkles.
His plans include luring the Ag
gies off-side and making them
take the long, looping shots which
Dierdorff is adept at defending
against.
The Stanford soccer squad
hopes to regain its winning ways
against the Cal Aggies, in a game
that will be played tomorrow at
Davis.
Stanford has been riddled by
ineligibilities, injury, and aban
donment.
Three starters and three ca
pable substitutes have been de
clared ineligible due to reasons
ranging from NCAA rules to aca
demic deficiencies.
EMMANUEL ANDAH, Stan
ford’s top scoring threat, and per
haps the most dangerous soccer
player in the league, is a doubt
ful starter. He entered the hospi
tal last week and had to miss last
week’s game with San Jose State.
A doctor will have to rule whether
he can play this week.
Beau Bianchi, starting goalie
for all last season and most of

this one. has presumably quit the
team since no one has heard from
him in over a week.
Hunt Bascom, starting goalie
against San Jose, turned in the
best job by a Stanford goalie in
several years last week. However,
other commitments may keep
him out of the lineup tomorrow.
Aside from these little difficul
ties, Stanford will be at top
strength against the Aggies.
DAVE DIERDORFF may get
the call at goalie by default. Full
backs are Rich Loncrgan, a tal
ented sophomore, and Edgar Ber
ner, a former starting center half
who was switched to the deeper
backfield position when all-con
ference fullback Dan Farthing
was declared ineligible.
