# Poloists Face Rugged (JSC, Fullerton JC
## 
### 
The Stanford water polo team !
has a busy weekend, facing both
USC and Fullerton Junior Col
lege. The game with the Trojans |
will be in the Stanford Pool and
will start at 3:30 this afternoon.
The Fullerton contest will be held
tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.
The Cards will be counting on
their fast-breaking offense led by
George Harrison and the three
Lorton brothers.
Harrison was a member of the
1960 U.S. Olympic team and is
probably th fastest man on the!
squad.
THE LORTONS, Bill, Bob and
Jack have been mainstays of the
team all year. Bill and Bob will
be starting at forwards and Jack
will start at the guard position.
Pete Pettigrew and Bob Spence
also add to the Card scoring
punch.
The defense is built around all-
AAWU Goalie John Bates who i
has been playing an outstanding i
game all year. However, second 1
string goalie Dick Gregory was I
singled out by coach Jim Gaugh- j
ran for his play last Wednesday !
against San Francisco State and i
he may challenge Bates for the
starting spot before the season is |
over.

Gaughran alternated his first
two units against San Francisco
State to take better advantage of
his depth of talent and will prob
ably do the same this weekend.
In this way he hopes to wear down
the powerful Trojan and Fuller
ton squads.
Gaughran feels that both USC
and Fullerton will provide real
tests for his swimmers but is con
fident of winning both games. He
says “If we can keep everyone
moving we will be okay.”
Two wins this weekend would
give the Indians a 5-2 season
mark.
