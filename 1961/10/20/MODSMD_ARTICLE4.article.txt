# Tryouts Today For Revamped Art Board Jobs
## 
### 
A “completely new, revamped’’
ASSU Art Board will begin try
outs for 20 positions today, newly
appointed board President Ed
Strong announced yesterday.
The Art Board is looking,
Strong said, for interested, hard
working people to work in the
several phases of design and pro
duction of publicity materials for
campus organizations, functions
and election candidates.
ART BOARD’S function is
specified by the ASSU constitu
tion as “the control, furtherance
and raising of standards of cam
pus publicity.’’ Strong said crea
tion and production of posters by
silk screen, letterpress and offset
will be a large part of the Board’s
work.
He emphasized that because of
the complete reorganization of the
board, many opportunities exist
for experience in an activity which
offers genuine service to the cam
pus, plus good practical training
in the graphic arts and responsi
ble positions in an ASSU organiza
tion. “We’re alive,” Strong said.
TRYOUTS begin today from 1
to 3 p.m. at the Art Board office,
upstairs in the Union. Signups
for continued tryouts, set for
Monday from 1 to 5 p.m. and
later next week, may be made at
the ASSU Office.
Strong said the group is an out
let, a place for people to be cre
ative in a useful way and to see
their work in mass production.
About three hours work per week
will be required from members,
and activity credit may be ar
ranged, he said.
Because of the big job of elec
tion posters about to start, the
board also needs secretarial help.
Other officers are Bill Bremer,
business manager, Jon Stevens,
assistant manager and Cathy
Clcrninsliaw, executive secretary.
