### 
Only eight students have filed nomination papers for candidacy
in the first ASSU election of the year, and none of the eight are
running for the office of head yell-leader, the top position up for
grabs. After two days of nominations only five of fourteen positions
have drawn candidates, and only one race shapes up as a contest.

Five freshmen are seeking two
positions as LASSU representa
tives from Wilbur Hall: Richard
Cerierwell and Douglas Schwab,
Rinconada; Gary Severson, Ma
dera; Andy Williams and Pete
Steil, Soto.
Jon Hirschoff, Phi Sigma Kap
pa, has declared his candidacy
for one of two men’s council po
sitions available. Clark Hinder
leidor, Junipero, seeks the frosh
presidency, and Charles Lofgren,
off campus, is a candidate for
LASSU representative from the
graduate schools of Humanities
and Sciences and Mineral Sci
ences.
According to Elections Commis
sion chairman Chuck Bischoff,
the students in these two gradu
ate schools will vote together to
pick two LASSU representatives,
one from the School of Humani
ties and Sciences and one from
the School of Mineral Sciences,
as the result of a new interpre
tation of the ASSU bylaws.
Bischoff lashed out at Stanford
men for their lack of interest in
the position of head yell-leader.
“If the men don’t give a damn,
lot’s see some women go out for
the .job,” he said. “The only re
quirement is completion of three
quarters or 45 units of college
work including two full quarters
at Stanford.”
Bischoff also lamented the lack
of interest in men’s and women’s
council positions. The only re
quirements are that students
have completed 90 units or six
quarters, including two quarters
at Stanford.
A complete list of qualifica
