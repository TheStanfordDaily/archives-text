# LASSU Nixes Political Union Fund Raising
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Editor 
Legislature last night refused a
Poliitcal Union request to charge
25 cents admission to a talk by
Sen. Paul Douglas (D.I1I.) on the
ground there was no need for the
money which would have been
raised from the charge.
The talk, scheduled for Nov. 3,
will be the keynote speech to the
Political Institute program. Some
$750 has been allocated for the
Institute.
The request for the 25-cent ad
mission price was rejected after
Political Union President Lawrie
Chickering replied “No” to ASSU
President Boh Sayler’s question
whether there was “some reason
why we need the money” now.
CHICKERING said he request
ed the admission fee in looking
forward to the lime when the
Union might need money. Several
Legislature members suggested
that Poli Union request a charge
in the future if it felt a need then.
Ratts commented that charging
admission is “contradictory to the
whole philosophy of presenting
these programs” to the students.
He pointed out that in the past
Legislature has been forced to
pick up the tab when Poli Union
hasn’t had enough money to pay
speakers, and suggested that
Chickering should have checked
with him and LASSU before com
mitting the Union to bringing
Douglas to Stanford.
IN OTHER MATTERS, LASSU
appropriated $ll2 for plane trans
portation of two pom pon girls to
the Washington football game in
Seattle tomorrow.
It also allocated $125 to buy
1.000 cards for Rally Commission
football card stunts.
The constitution of the new
Stanford Volunteer Commission
was given its first reading and
sent to the By-Laws and Rules
Committee.

Purpose of the new commission
when it begins operations will be
lo “establish a liasion between the
various hospitals and convalescent
homes in the Stanford-Palo Alto
area and the students of Stanford
. . . who wish to contribute their
vices lo those institutions.*’

will be the keynote speech to the
Political Institute program. Some
$750 has been allocated for the
Institute.
The request for the 25-cent ad
mission price was rejected after
Political Union President Lawrie
Chickering replied “No” to ASSU
President Boh Sayler’s question
whether there was “some reason
why we need the money” now.
CHICKERING said he request
ed the admission fee in looking
forward to the lime when the
Union might need money. Several
Legislature members suggested
that Poli Union request a charge
in the future if it felt a need then.
Ratts commented that charging
admission is “contradictory to the
whole philosophy of presenting
these programs” to the students.
He pointed out that in the past
Legislature has been forced to
pick up the tab when Poli Union
hasn’t had enough money to pay
speakers, and suggested that
Chickering should have checked
with him and LASSU before com
mitting the Union to bringing
Douglas to Stanford.
IN OTHER MATTERS, LASSU
appropriated $ll2 for plane trans
portation of two pom pon girls to
the Washington football game in
Seattle tomorrow.
It also allocated $125 to buy
1.000 cards for Rally Commission
football card stunts.
The constitution of the new
Stanford Volunteer Commission
was given its first reading and
sent to the By-Laws and Rules
Committee.

Purpose of the new commission
when it begins operations will be
lo “establish a liasion between the
various hospitals and convalescent
homes in the Stanford-Palo Alto
area and the students of Stanford
. . . who wish to contribute their
vices lo those institutions.*’
