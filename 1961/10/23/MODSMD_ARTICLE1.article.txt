# $1000 PRANK
## SJS Vandals To Pay for Farm Damage 
### 
Nine San Jose State College
students have been put on pro
bation and will be held financially
responsible for vandalism in the
Stanford Stadium before San
Jose’s loss to Stanford two weeks
ago.
THE DISCIPLINARY action
was voted by the SJS ASB .judi
ciary and approved by SJS Presi
dent John T. Wahlquist after an
open investigation last week. The
nine confessed to using gasoline
to burn a large “SJS’’ on the
floor of the stadium, but denied
having cut the goal posts, burned
two smaller “SJSs” on the fieid
with lye, or smeared the score
board with gold paint.
Declaring that their actions
were prompted by “intense rival
ry preceeding the game,” the stu
dents said they were willing to
pay for damage they caused but
that “We are not willing to pay
for something we didn’t do.”
When caught by the Stanford
police at 4 a.m. Friday, the stu
dents made no mention of any
damage beyond that which they
caused, and were not told by the
police of further damage.
TWO OF’ THE nine reported
at the investigation having heard
another student tell of pranks in
the stadium. The name of this
student has been given to San
Jose Associate Dean of Students
Robert S. Martin for investiga
tion. Martin reported that he ex
pects to complete his investiga
tion early this week.
Total cost of the damage will
not be known for some time. Gor
don R. Davis, chief of Stanford
police, stated that reseeding will
not begin until after football sea
son. Cost of damage will be
assessed by the number of man
hours required to replace it. A
tentative estimate is $l,OOO.
STANFORD POLICE were un
able to judge the guilt of the
nine. They were caught outside
the stadium and had empty gas
and lye cans in the trunk of their
car, as reported by The Daily, but
it is impossible to say just how
much of the damage they caused.
Unless some evidence is pro
duced incriminating other people
in the vandalism, the nine will be
held responsible for all the dam
age. The SJS judiciary with the
approval of the faculty has prom
ised to deal justice with a heavy
hand in protecting its reputation.

responsible for vandalism in the
Stanford Stadium before San
Jose’s loss to Stanford two weeks
ago.
THE DISCIPLINARY action
was voted by the SJS ASB .judi
ciary and approved by SJS Presi
dent John T. Wahlquist after an
open investigation last week. The
nine confessed to using gasoline
to burn a large “SJS’’ on the
floor of the stadium, but denied
having cut the goal posts, burned
two smaller “SJSs” on the fieid
with lye, or smeared the score
board with gold paint.
Declaring that their actions
were prompted by “intense rival
ry preceeding the game,” the stu
dents said they were willing to
pay for damage they caused but
that “We are not willing to pay
for something we didn’t do.”
When caught by the Stanford
police at 4 a.m. Friday, the stu
dents made no mention of any
damage beyond that which they
caused, and were not told by the
police of further damage.
TWO OF’ THE nine reported
at the investigation having heard
another student tell of pranks in
the stadium. The name of this
student has been given to San
Jose Associate Dean of Students
Robert S. Martin for investiga
tion. Martin reported that he ex
pects to complete his investiga
tion early this week.
Total cost of the damage will
not be known for some time. Gor
don R. Davis, chief of Stanford
police, stated that reseeding will
not begin until after football sea
son. Cost of damage will be
assessed by the number of man
hours required to replace it. A
tentative estimate is $l,OOO.
STANFORD POLICE were un
able to judge the guilt of the
nine. They were caught outside
the stadium and had empty gas
and lye cans in the trunk of their
car, as reported by The Daily, but
it is impossible to say just how
much of the damage they caused.
Unless some evidence is pro
duced incriminating other people
in the vandalism, the nine will be
held responsible for all the dam
age. The SJS judiciary with the
approval of the faculty has prom
ised to deal justice with a heavy
hand in protecting its reputation.
Nine San Jose State College
students have been put on pro
bation and will be held financially
responsible for vandalism in the
Stanford Stadium before San
Jose’s loss to Stanford two weeks
ago.
