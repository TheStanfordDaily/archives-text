# Females Vie for Head Yell Leader In Male-less Race
## 
### 
An unprecedented race for the
position of head yell leader is
shaping up, due to the filing of
two nomination petitions over the
weekend. Both of the prospective
candidates are girls.

Even the oldtimers around the
campus are unable to remember
whether this has ever happened
before. Head yell leader has
always been considered a natural
male function. But apparently
the males are abdicating, and the
girls are only too willing to step
in.

JUDY LEVIN of Union was the
first to file. When contacted for
a statement, she was brief and
to the point: “If elected I will.”

Grace Daniels of Mirlo, who
boasts that she is a cousin of
the immortal Kartozian, promises
to move Stanford to the Rose
Bowl if elected. “Being a Stan
ford woman, I have a particular
attachment for roses, whether
for late minutes or otherwise,”
she states. She promises to “keep
the welfare of humor at heart,
bringing only the rarest and fin
est to Stanford’s athletic endeav
ors.”

Five other petitions filed
brought the number of candidates
to 15 who are in the running for
the 14 available positions in the
election, to be held next week.
Julie Peck of Mirlo, D or i n d a
Miles of Eucalpto, and Susan
Russell of Adelfa will compete
for the two places on Women’s
Council. Ann Evans is the only

girl to show interest in represent
ing Rohie on LASSU. No one has
filed from Branner.
VINTON CEBF of Stern has
entered the race for Class of ’65
president, opposing Clark Hinder
leider. The vice presidency of the
class is still going begging.

The Graduate School of Min
eral Sciences and the Graduate
School of Engineering still lack
prospective representatives to
LASSU. Charles Lofgren filed
last week from the Graduate
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, and is still unopposed, as
is Jon Hirschoff, running for
Men's Council, which has two po
sitions open.
Only the job of Wilbur LASSU
rep is the subject of real con
troversy. Douglas Schwab, Rich
ard Cederwell, Andy Williams,
Pete Steil, and Gary Severson will
battle it out.
NOMINATIONS will close to
morrow afternoon at 5, but
blanks are still available. All can
didates must attend a compulsory
meeting tomorrow evening at
7 in Room 320, or face disguali
fication.

Election rallies for the coming
week have been announced by
Bob Gates, rally chairman of
Election Com. Frosh candidates
will appear at Branner Wednes
day night, Roble on Thursday,
and Wilbur Friday. Head yell
leader nominees will lead cheers
at half-time of the UCLA game
and will be introduced at a noon
rally next Monday.
