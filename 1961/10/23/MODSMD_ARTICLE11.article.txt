According to material written

—popularly called socialism, com-"
monism, Fabianism, nazism, the
welfare state, the planned econ
omy, or whatever—grows rapidly
here in the U.S.A. and elsewhere
not because this “progressive”
ideology lacks opponents, but be
cause there are so few opponents
who adequately understand and
can competently and attractively
explain interventionisms’s oppo
site ...”

The opposite, he says, is “. . .
the free market, private property,
limited government philosophy
and its moral and spiritual ante
cedents. . . . FEE’s assignment is
... to specialize in better under
standing this philosophy our
selves while exploring ways of
explaining it with ever-improving
clarity the resulting studies
made available to all. . . .
“SOME OF our activities, such
as speeches, are useful in arous
ing a spirit of inquiry,” says
Read. “About 30 per cent of my
own time is devoted to lecturing.
I travel 60-70,000 miles annually,
in this and other countries.

“Audiences range from small
discussion and seminar groups to
assemblies of 1,500, and include
appearances before college stu
dents and faculties, farm and
business organizations, foremen,
secondary schools, and the like.
“REPLACING interventionist
notions with the freedom philoso
phy— the only possible antidote
to an expanding socialism in
volves more than a mere belief
in freedom ideas. Involved, also,
are the means we use to bring
about the replacement.”

The Foundation for Economic
Education, Inc., has published
over 50 books supporting the
“freedom philosophy.” It issues a
monthly “study jo u r n a 1.” The
Freeman, sponsors debates, ar
ranges seminars, sends textbooks
and materials to high schools, and
conducts an exchange program
for college professors.
