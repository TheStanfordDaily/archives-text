# Amendment Tries for Soph LASSU Rep
## 
### 
A proposed amendment to the
ASSU constitution which would
insure sophomore representation
in Legislature will be up for
voters’ approval at the ASSU pri
mary election, Nov. 1-2.
A petition sponsored by the
Class of ’64 calling for a vote on
the amendment was received Fri
day by Election Commission
Chairman Chuck Bischoff. It con
tained 548 signatures, well above
the required figure of five per
cent of the ASSU.
IF APPROVED by 2/3 of the
voters the amendment would cre
ate LASSU representatives from
the sophomore class at large
elected by the class in the spring
quarter of its freshman year. The
number of representatives and the
method of election would be set by
ASSU bylaws.
Sophomores have no represen
tation on LASSU under the cur
rent arrangement. When LASSU
representatives are elected in the
spring members of the following
year’s sophomore class are fresh
men and not yet part of a living
group eligible to vote for LASSU
representatives.
The petitioners maintained it
unfair that “1400 duly registered
members of the ASSU should not
be given the right to run for
LASSU office or to vote for those
that do run for office.”
ACTUALLY, spring quarter
freshmen can run for LASSU rep
resentative as future members of
their sophomore year living
groups. But the impossibility of
getting voting support of their
classmates has discouraged spring
quarter freshmen from running
for office in this way.
The petition, undated, was al
legedly circulated and submitted
to ASSU last spring.
Anyone planning to organize
either support for or opposition
to the proposition must attend the
candidates’ meeting tomorrow
evening at 7.
