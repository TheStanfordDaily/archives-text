# Sharing Needed in The Peace Corps
## 
### 
As an enthusiastic backer of the Peace Corps, The Daily could
not help but be disappointed by the incident in Nigeria involving
Margery Michelmore and her wandering post card.
But there is a difference in being disappointed and in being
shocked and angry, as some persons apparently were when the
headlines sprouted in the press and the stories from Nigeria began
to receive page 1 play.

We were not shocked, nor were we surprised, for in such a pro
gram as the Peace Corps—particularly in its first year of operation
mistakes will be made, and some of them will receive wide pub
licity. This was pointed out both by Sargent Shriver, director of
the Corps, and by the Nigerian ambassador in Washington.
The wise policy is to train the Peace Corps members in every
possible way, so that the chance for slipups is held to a minimum.
And, of course, we assume that both the Peace Corps headquarters
and those in the field will take note of whatever mistakes do occur
so that the same ones will not be repeated.
We are concerned, however, with a point brought out in the
story at the top of this page sent to a friend at Stanford by Judy
Houtz, a Stanfordite studying on her own at the college in Nigeria
w here Miss Michelmore was living.
Miss Houtz notes that “Members of the Peace Corps were
allowed 250 pounds of luggage and so arrived with all the para
phernalia of an average American student.” She adds that she had
thought two years in the Corps would mean giving up such things.
So had we.
The thought of an American arriving in any foreign country
with 250 pounds of luggage, while at the same time declaring he
had come to live at the same level of life as the natives of that coun
try, makes us shudder.
We feel the Peace Corps members could manage to get along
with something less than 250 pounds of luggage, and that the Corps
directors should ban such things as hi-fi’s, portable TV’s, guns, for
mats and so on from the members’ luggage. In other words, only
necessities should accompany Peace Corps members on their assign
ments.
Miss Houtz also reports that after at first trying to fit in as much
as possible with normal Nigerian student life, the Americans began
eating special meals and sticking together. This, too, disturbs us.
Anyone who has traveled overseas knows that a period of adjust
ment to foreign food is necessary for an American, just as a for
eigner must adjust to our food. But that adjustment must be made
if one is to live in another country for any amount of time.
We hope, we expect, Peace Corps directors will insure that in
the future members eat the native food and do not form clans of
Americans—even when in training at a foreign university.
The Peace Corps is a service to humanity. It is a challenge and
an invaluable learning experience. But in order to serve, to Jeam,
to give of themselves, Peace Corps members must share as com
pletely as possible the life of those they are helping.

and those in the field will take note of whatever mistakes do occur
so that the same ones will not be repeated.
We are concerned, however, with a point brought out in the
story at the top of this page sent to a friend at Stanford by Judy
Houtz, a Stanfordite studying on her own at the college in Nigeria
w here Miss Michelmore was living.
Miss Houtz notes that “Members of the Peace Corps were
allowed 250 pounds of luggage and so arrived with all the para
phernalia of an average American student.” She adds that she had
thought two years in the Corps would mean giving up such things.
So had we.
The thought of an American arriving in any foreign country
with 250 pounds of luggage, while at the same time declaring he
had come to live at the same level of life as the natives of that coun
try, makes us shudder.
We feel the Peace Corps members could manage to get along
with something less than 250 pounds of luggage, and that the Corps
directors should ban such things as hi-fi’s, portable TV’s, guns, for
mats and so on from the members’ luggage. In other words, only
necessities should accompany Peace Corps members on their assign
ments.
Miss Houtz also reports that after at first trying to fit in as much
as possible with normal Nigerian student life, the Americans began
eating special meals and sticking together. This, too, disturbs us.
Anyone who has traveled overseas knows that a period of adjust
ment to foreign food is necessary for an American, just as a for
eigner must adjust to our food. But that adjustment must be made
if one is to live in another country for any amount of time.
We hope, we expect, Peace Corps directors will insure that in
the future members eat the native food and do not form clans of
Americans—even when in training at a foreign university.
The Peace Corps is a service to humanity. It is a challenge and
an invaluable learning experience. But in order to serve, to Jeam,
to give of themselves, Peace Corps members must share as com
pletely as possible the life of those they are helping.
As an enthusiastic backer of the Peace Corps, The Daily could
not help but be disappointed by the incident in Nigeria involving
Margery Michelmore and her wandering post card.
But there is a difference in being disappointed and in being
shocked and angry, as some persons apparently were when the
headlines sprouted in the press and the stories from Nigeria began
to receive page 1 play.

We were not shocked, nor were we surprised, for in such a pro
gram as the Peace Corps—particularly in its first year of operation
mistakes will be made, and some of them will receive wide pub
licity. This was pointed out both by Sargent Shriver, director of
the Corps, and by the Nigerian ambassador in Washington.
The wise policy is to train the Peace Corps members in every
possible way, so that the chance for slipups is held to a minimum.
And, of course, we assume that both the Peace Corps headquarters
and those in the field will take note of whatever mistakes do occur
so that the same ones will not be repeated.
