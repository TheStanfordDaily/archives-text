## Will the Western Allies Sell Out West Berlin? 
### SUSAN BROWN 
Recently I received a lengthy
letter from a student friend in
Berlin, who raised a quite often
overlooked, but important, point
concerning West Berlin’s relation
to the Western powers.
Shortly after the Communist
closing of the East-West Berlin
border on Aug. 13, the widely
read West German political news
magazine Der Spiegel published
an article which reputed that at
the beginning of August, when
they met on the Black Sea,
Khrushchev told John McCloy—
special assistant to President Ken
nedy on disarmament of his
plans for Aug. 13.
He said that the border must be
closed in order to stop the refugee
flow, and that if the West did not
take any action against this move,
the status of West Berlin would
not be affected in any way.
ACCORDING TO Der Spiegel,
when the border was closed the
leaders of the Western powers re
mained quietly on vacation, be
cause they already knew that a
passive policy would guarantee
their own legal rights in Berlin.
My Berlin friend, and apparent
ly many other Berliners, no longer
trusts the Western powers not to
“sell out’’ West Berlin and its
population in a similar way.
Except for allied military traf
fic, East Germans already control
East Zone land border crossings,
and for this reason all refugees
can travel safely to and from West
Berlin only by flying.
IF RUSSIA eventually signs the
peace treaty with East Germany
and makes it a “sovereign state,”
East Germany will also have the
right to control what flies over its
territory.
The U.S. has stated that it will
go to war if it cannot uphold its
“legal rights” of access to West

Berlin.
Suppose East Germany says,
“We will not interfere with allied
rights in or access to, West Berlin.
The allied military trains will con
tinue to run and allied military
airplanes will continue to fly sub
ject to our control and inspection,
but no citizen of any other coun
try, including West Germany, will
leave or enter this sovereign
state unless he possesses proper
papers.”
IN OTHER words, the East Gor
mans would control and inspect
whoever flies across East Ger
many as they today control and
inspect whoever drives across
East Germany, and no West Ger
man without proper papers, 1.e.,
no former East German—no refu
gee—would be able to leave West
Berlin.

So the question is, how many
concessions will we make before
we go to war? What will we con
sider interference with our rights
of access? Will we stop at allied
rights and overlook total rights
for all other nationalities, includ
ing West German?
Will we consider West Berlin
part of the territory of the West
German state (which today it le
gally is not) subject to total pro
tection and defense under the
NATO pact?
OR WILL. WE, in order to avoid
war, become more legally than
morally minded and begin our
dealings with the East German
state by half-selling the freedom
of West Berlin and her citizens?
The freedom and actual lives of
thousands of West Berliners who,
as either refugees or “undesirable
politicians” would be seized if
placed in the hands of East Ger
man controls, depends upon our
answer to these questions.
They want to know if they
should get out now, while the get
ting is good.

Suppose East Germany says,
“We will not interfere with allied
rights in or access to, West Berlin.
The allied military trains will con
tinue to run and allied military
airplanes will continue to fly sub
ject to our control and inspection,
but no citizen of any other coun
try, including West Germany, will
leave or enter this sovereign
state unless he possesses proper
papers.”
IN OTHER words, the East Gor
mans would control and inspect
whoever flies across East Ger
many as they today control and
inspect whoever drives across
East Germany, and no West Ger
man without proper papers, 1.e.,
no former East German—no refu
gee—would be able to leave West
Berlin.

So the question is, how many
concessions will we make before
we go to war? What will we con
sider interference with our rights
of access? Will we stop at allied
rights and overlook total rights
for all other nationalities, includ
ing West German?
Will we consider West Berlin
part of the territory of the West
German state (which today it le
gally is not) subject to total pro
tection and defense under the
NATO pact?
OR WILL. WE, in order to avoid
war, become more legally than
morally minded and begin our
dealings with the East German
state by half-selling the freedom
of West Berlin and her citizens?
The freedom and actual lives of
thousands of West Berliners who,
as either refugees or “undesirable
politicians” would be seized if
placed in the hands of East Ger
man controls, depends upon our
answer to these questions.
They want to know if they
should get out now, while the get
ting is good.
Recently I received a lengthy
letter from a student friend in
Berlin, who raised a quite often
overlooked, but important, point
concerning West Berlin’s relation
to the Western powers.
Shortly after the Communist
closing of the East-West Berlin
border on Aug. 13, the widely
read West German political news
magazine Der Spiegel published
an article which reputed that at
the beginning of August, when
they met on the Black Sea,
Khrushchev told John McCloy—
special assistant to President Ken
nedy on disarmament of his
plans for Aug. 13.
He said that the border must be
closed in order to stop the refugee
flow, and that if the West did not
take any action against this move,
the status of West Berlin would
not be affected in any way.
ACCORDING TO Der Spiegel,
when the border was closed the
leaders of the Western powers re
mained quietly on vacation, be
cause they already knew that a
passive policy would guarantee
their own legal rights in Berlin.
My Berlin friend, and apparent
ly many other Berliners, no longer
trusts the Western powers not to
“sell out’’ West Berlin and its
population in a similar way.
Except for allied military traf
fic, East Germans already control
East Zone land border crossings,
and for this reason all refugees
can travel safely to and from West
Berlin only by flying.
IF RUSSIA eventually signs the
peace treaty with East Germany
and makes it a “sovereign state,”
East Germany will also have the
right to control what flies over its
territory.
The U.S. has stated that it will
go to war if it cannot uphold its
“legal rights” of access to West

Berlin.
