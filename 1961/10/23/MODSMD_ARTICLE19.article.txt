# Stanford Girl Reacts To Post Card Incident
## 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow
ing letter, dated Oct. 14, was sent
to a Stanford student. It is from
Judy Houtz, a Stanford student
studying this year at University
College, Ibadan, Nigeria. It was
there that the “post card” inci
dent see below involving a
Peace Corps girl occurred. In this
letter, Miss Houtz, who is not con
nected with the Corps but is there
as a private citizen, describes her
reaction to the Peace Corps mem
bers in Ibadan).

I cannot describe to you the hos
tile reaction that has followed this
post card. Unfortunately the post
card is not a fraud. The only de
fense of the girl who wrote it is
that it was a “joke.”
There is a rather understand
able undercurrent of edgincss to
ward Americans here. Many
Americans, especially the younger
ones, compensate by breaking
away from ’’European” society
and making a determined effort
to win the friendship of their stu
dents and co-workers.

And the Nigerians in turn offer
extraordinary hospitality and con
sideration. One girl said; “We
know our country is poor, and we
go out of our way to be friendly
and helpful. Why do you have to
say such things about us?”
When Dr. bike, the principal,

welcomed the Peace Corps, he said
”... and we are doubly grateful
because your government is pay
ing the entire cost.”
THIS IS PERHAPS one of the
keys to the problem. There is a
very big difference between the
teachers whom the Western Re
gion has imported from the
United States at great expense
and the teachers who are sent
free by the Peace Corps; a differ
ence between men coming to do a
job and organized do-gooders ar
riving on a cloud of philanthropy
and good intentions.
Members of the Peace Corps
were allowed 250 pounds of lug
gage and so arrived with all the
paraphernalia of an average
American student, including hi-fi,
things I’d thought two years in
the Peace Corps would mean
giving up.

On their first day, one of the
girls came to me and said; “At
Harvard they told us this place
would be a real palace”—(Miss
Houtz said, “It is, look around
you”)—“But the rooms are so
small and there’s no closet space”
•—("there’s no hot water either”)
•—“No! What will I do?”
SHORTLY AFTER they came,
an agriculture student invited one
of the girls and myself on a tour
of Ibadan and the agricultural ex

tension station. Wo accepted and
the next morning the girl came to
my room. She had been talking
to the wife of an English lecturer
and was advised not to go.

“Don’t go into town alone with
anyone until you know them well;
you never know where they might
want to take you. Besides, you
are representatives of your gov
ernment and wouldn’t want to get
into any tricky situations. And
too, don’t walk with any of the
boys on campus at night.”
So she begged off.
At first the Americans tried to
avoid each other and tried to fit
in as completely as possible. At
first they even tried to eat the
food. Now they have special meals
prepared for them and stick to
gether. They are very busy with
their classes and do not want to
lose energy by having stomach
trouble.

A FEW DAYS AGO two couples
went to a European restaurant
and, I think enjoyed their food
rather noisily. A Nigerian came
up and asked “Why aren’t you in
Montgomery or Little Rock in
stead of living like parasites in
Nigeria?”
And now this incident (the
post card). It has almost been
hoped for.

Senator Neuberger (of Oregon)
was here yesterday and they
fooled her by keeping her away
from the college. She will know
tomorrow. The principal knows,
the Ambassador knows, and to
morrow the papers will carry the
full story.
WHAT I want to say is this: I
believe very deeply in the ideal of
the Peace Corps; warfare against
hunger, disease, poverty and illit
eracy. But we can’t uplift the
masses by putting on a costume
theatrical: the American Way of
Life.

Nor can we arrive with banners
unfurled bearing education like a
Christmas turkey for the poor. If
we are to succeed at all in this
type of venture, we must come not
to sacrifice and give alone, but to
share and exchange. •

there that the “post card” inci
dent see below involving a
Peace Corps girl occurred. In this
letter, Miss Houtz, who is not con
nected with the Corps but is there
as a private citizen, describes her
reaction to the Peace Corps mem
bers in Ibadan).

I cannot describe to you the hos
tile reaction that has followed this
post card. Unfortunately the post
card is not a fraud. The only de
fense of the girl who wrote it is
that it was a “joke.”
There is a rather understand
able undercurrent of edgincss to
ward Americans here. Many
Americans, especially the younger
ones, compensate by breaking
away from ’’European” society
and making a determined effort
to win the friendship of their stu
dents and co-workers.

And the Nigerians in turn offer
extraordinary hospitality and con
sideration. One girl said; “We
know our country is poor, and we
go out of our way to be friendly
and helpful. Why do you have to
say such things about us?”
When Dr. bike, the principal,

welcomed the Peace Corps, he said
”... and we are doubly grateful
because your government is pay
ing the entire cost.”
THIS IS PERHAPS one of the
keys to the problem. There is a
very big difference between the
teachers whom the Western Re
gion has imported from the
United States at great expense
and the teachers who are sent
free by the Peace Corps; a differ
ence between men coming to do a
job and organized do-gooders ar
riving on a cloud of philanthropy
and good intentions.
Members of the Peace Corps
were allowed 250 pounds of lug
gage and so arrived with all the
paraphernalia of an average
American student, including hi-fi,
things I’d thought two years in
the Peace Corps would mean
giving up.

On their first day, one of the
girls came to me and said; “At
Harvard they told us this place
would be a real palace”—(Miss
Houtz said, “It is, look around
you”)—“But the rooms are so
small and there’s no closet space”
•—("there’s no hot water either”)
•—“No! What will I do?”
SHORTLY AFTER they came,
an agriculture student invited one
of the girls and myself on a tour
of Ibadan and the agricultural ex

tension station. Wo accepted and
the next morning the girl came to
my room. She had been talking
to the wife of an English lecturer
and was advised not to go.

“Don’t go into town alone with
anyone until you know them well;
you never know where they might
want to take you. Besides, you
are representatives of your gov
ernment and wouldn’t want to get
into any tricky situations. And
too, don’t walk with any of the
boys on campus at night.”
So she begged off.
At first the Americans tried to
avoid each other and tried to fit
in as completely as possible. At
first they even tried to eat the
food. Now they have special meals
prepared for them and stick to
gether. They are very busy with
their classes and do not want to
lose energy by having stomach
trouble.

A FEW DAYS AGO two couples
went to a European restaurant
and, I think enjoyed their food
rather noisily. A Nigerian came
up and asked “Why aren’t you in
Montgomery or Little Rock in
stead of living like parasites in
Nigeria?”
And now this incident (the
post card). It has almost been
hoped for.

Senator Neuberger (of Oregon)
was here yesterday and they
fooled her by keeping her away
from the college. She will know
tomorrow. The principal knows,
the Ambassador knows, and to
morrow the papers will carry the
full story.
WHAT I want to say is this: I
believe very deeply in the ideal of
the Peace Corps; warfare against
hunger, disease, poverty and illit
eracy. But we can’t uplift the
masses by putting on a costume
theatrical: the American Way of
Life.

Nor can we arrive with banners
unfurled bearing education like a
Christmas turkey for the poor. If
we are to succeed at all in this
type of venture, we must come not
to sacrifice and give alone, but to
share and exchange. •

bers in Ibadan).

I cannot describe to you the hos
tile reaction that has followed this
post card. Unfortunately the post
card is not a fraud. The only de
fense of the girl who wrote it is
that it was a “joke.”
There is a rather understand
able undercurrent of edgincss to
ward Americans here. Many
Americans, especially the younger
ones, compensate by breaking
away from ’’European” society
and making a determined effort
to win the friendship of their stu
dents and co-workers.

And the Nigerians in turn offer
extraordinary hospitality and con
sideration. One girl said; “We
know our country is poor, and we
go out of our way to be friendly
and helpful. Why do you have to
say such things about us?”
When Dr. bike, the principal,

welcomed the Peace Corps, he said
”... and we are doubly grateful
because your government is pay
ing the entire cost.”
THIS IS PERHAPS one of the
keys to the problem. There is a
very big difference between the
teachers whom the Western Re
gion has imported from the
United States at great expense
and the teachers who are sent
free by the Peace Corps; a differ
ence between men coming to do a
job and organized do-gooders ar
riving on a cloud of philanthropy
and good intentions.
Members of the Peace Corps
were allowed 250 pounds of lug
gage and so arrived with all the
paraphernalia of an average
American student, including hi-fi,
things I’d thought two years in
the Peace Corps would mean
giving up.

On their first day, one of the
girls came to me and said; “At
Harvard they told us this place
would be a real palace”—(Miss
Houtz said, “It is, look around
you”)—“But the rooms are so
small and there’s no closet space”
•—("there’s no hot water either”)
•—“No! What will I do?”
SHORTLY AFTER they came,
an agriculture student invited one
of the girls and myself on a tour
of Ibadan and the agricultural ex

tension station. Wo accepted and
the next morning the girl came to
my room. She had been talking
to the wife of an English lecturer
and was advised not to go.

“Don’t go into town alone with
anyone until you know them well;
you never know where they might
want to take you. Besides, you
are representatives of your gov
ernment and wouldn’t want to get
into any tricky situations. And
too, don’t walk with any of the
boys on campus at night.”
So she begged off.
At first the Americans tried to
avoid each other and tried to fit
in as completely as possible. At
first they even tried to eat the
food. Now they have special meals
prepared for them and stick to
gether. They are very busy with
their classes and do not want to
lose energy by having stomach
trouble.

A FEW DAYS AGO two couples
went to a European restaurant
and, I think enjoyed their food
rather noisily. A Nigerian came
up and asked “Why aren’t you in
Montgomery or Little Rock in
stead of living like parasites in
Nigeria?”
And now this incident (the
post card). It has almost been
hoped for.

Senator Neuberger (of Oregon)
was here yesterday and they
fooled her by keeping her away
from the college. She will know
tomorrow. The principal knows,
the Ambassador knows, and to
morrow the papers will carry the
full story.
WHAT I want to say is this: I
believe very deeply in the ideal of
the Peace Corps; warfare against
hunger, disease, poverty and illit
eracy. But we can’t uplift the
masses by putting on a costume
theatrical: the American Way of
Life.

Nor can we arrive with banners
unfurled bearing education like a
Christmas turkey for the poor. If
we are to succeed at all in this
type of venture, we must come not
to sacrifice and give alone, but to
share and exchange. •
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow

Judy Houtz, a Stanford student

College, Ibadan, Nigeria. It was
there that the “post card” inci
