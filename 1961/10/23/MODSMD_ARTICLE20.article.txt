JUST IMAGINE ! ! !
A COPY OF THE LETTER FROM A PEACE CORPS GIRL TO
A FRIEND IN THE STATES PICKED UP ON THE
STREETS. THIS SHOULD SHOCK
EVERY NIGERIAN.

U. S. A.
Dear Bobbo,
Don’t be furious at getting a postcard. I promise a letter next
time. I wanted you to see the incredible and fascinating city we were
in. With all the training we had had, wo really were not prepared for
the squalor and absolutely primitive living conditions rampant both
in the city and in the hush. We had no idea about what “Under-de
veloped” meant. It really is a revelation and once we got over the
initial horrified shock, a very rewarding experience. Everyone except
us lives in the streets—cooks in the street, sells in the street and
even goes to the bathroom in the street. The University is great fun
as it is something to he a foreign student anyway and especially to
be the only white students in an All-African University. I just hope
that they don’t repeat last years Lumumba riots. Please write. We
are excessively cut off from the rest of the world.
Sgd. Marge.
