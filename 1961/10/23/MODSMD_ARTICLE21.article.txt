# Rusk Blasts Big Soviet Bomb
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk yester
day branded as “senseless,"
“pointless” and technically un
necessary Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev’s announced inten
tion to test a 50-megaton nuclear
bomb the end of this month.

Rusk also said that a majority
of the members of the United
Nations may approve a resolution
calling on Khrushchev not to ex
plode the weapon. But he added
that he had no idea what effect
such action would have on the
Soviet leader.

On a television program, Rusk
made these other points:
• KHRUSHCHEV’S softening
of his year-end deadline for sign
ing a peace treaty with Commu
nist East Germany was “a plus
rather than a minus” Indication
that the Berlin crisis may bo
settled peacefully. But he said
there was no prospect of immedi
ate negotiations.

• Rusk was among top govern
ment officials who went over in
advance the speech Saturday
night in which Deputy Defense
Secretary Roswell L. Gilpatric
told the world that U.S. nuclear
weapons now are numbered in
the “tens of thousands.” Rusk

said the administration decided to
let the world, including Russia,
know that the West is negotiat
ing ‘‘from a position of strength.”
Rusk added: “Mr. Khrushchev
must know that we are strong.”

• THE U.N. deadlock over
choosing a secretary-general may
reach the showdown stage this
week. He said many U.N. mem
hers feel the issue has dragged
on too long.

• There were signs at the re
cent Communist party meeting
in Moscow that things are noi
as rosy in the Communist work
as some party members woulc
like.
