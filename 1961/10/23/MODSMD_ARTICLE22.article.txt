## Hungarian Students Sparked Revolt 5 Years Ago Today 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Tills article

Hungarian graduate student at
Stanford who took part in the
Hungarian revolt. His name is not
used because he still has relatives
in Hungary.)
On Oct. 22, 1956, five years ago
today, students at the University
of Technical Sciences in Budapest
adopted a 16-point program whose
repercussions were destined to be
heard around the world.
The program included demands

for “general elections, universal
suffrage, secret ballot, the parti
cipation of several parties for the
purpose of electing a new Nation
al Assembly, freedom of opinion
and expression, freedom of the
press and a free radio.”
The students also supported the
right to strike and a reorganiza
tion of the country’s economic and
political life so as to encompass
the participation of the mass of
the Hungarian people.
HEADING OFF the students’

proclamation was the demand for
“the immediate withdrawal of all
Soviet troops in accordance with
the provisions of the peace
treaty.”
The students presented a docu
ment containing these demands to
the Budapest Radio, with the re
quest that it be read as part of a
news program.
The radio directors refused to
accept this suggestion, and offered
instead to read only five of the
more noncommittal points. The
censor absolutely refused permis
sion for the broadcasters to read
sections dealing with the with
drawal of Soviet troops, and the
demands for free press and free
elections.

UNWILLING to accept this lim
itation, the students began the dis
tribution of their proclamation
through their own small publica
tion. Within hours thousands of
copies flooded Budapest, and by
the next morning the city w'as dis
cussing nothing else.
On the afternoon of Oct. 23, fol
lowing a mass meeting to honor
the memory of a Hungarian pa
triot, the student representatives
again requested the radio authori
ties to broadcast the 16-point pro
gram.
There was another refusal.
While the student delegation
waited lor further negotiations,
huge unarmed crowds around the
radio building continued to shout
the slogans contained in the stu
dent manifesto.
Secret service police then began
to shoot into the demonstrators.
THE HUNGARIAN Revolution
had begun.
There were two significant as
pects to the preparation of this
16-point program. It was a student
group, as representative of the al
truistic conscience of the nation,
which undertook to summarize
the aspirations of a people under
Soviet control.
Second, it was a student group
which undertook to disseminate
the program, and thereby sparked
the most widespread revolt
against Soviet totalitarianism
since its inception 44 years ago.
The Hungarian Revolution was
drowned in blood by Soviet tanks,
but it remains, in the inelegant
phraseology of Premier Khrush
chev, “a bone in the throat.”
ALTHOUGH the Communist
rulers of Hungary, backed by the
Soviets, have consistently refused
to permit United Nations observ
ers into the country, through the
famous “Reports of the Special
Committee on the Problem of
Hungary,” issued in 1957, and in
subsequent resolutions, the U.N.
has kept the Hungarian issue alive
as a continuing indictment of the
oppressiveness of Soviet control
of the countries of East Europe.
Hungary has also pointed up
the international hypocrisy of the
Soviet Union, which supports
U.N. resolutions favoring self-de
termination in Asia and Africa
but relentlessly suppresses nat
tional aspirations within its own
sphere of influence.
The students who met in Buda
pest five years ago made a contri
bution to history through their
actions, and a further contribution
to human freedom by their enun
ciation of a democratic manifesto
which has a relevance for all
time.

elections.

UNWILLING to accept this lim
itation, the students began the dis
tribution of their proclamation
through their own small publica
tion. Within hours thousands of
copies flooded Budapest, and by
the next morning the city w'as dis
cussing nothing else.
On the afternoon of Oct. 23, fol
lowing a mass meeting to honor
the memory of a Hungarian pa
triot, the student representatives
again requested the radio authori
ties to broadcast the 16-point pro
gram.
There was another refusal.
While the student delegation
waited lor further negotiations,
huge unarmed crowds around the
radio building continued to shout
the slogans contained in the stu
dent manifesto.
Secret service police then began
to shoot into the demonstrators.
THE HUNGARIAN Revolution
had begun.
There were two significant as
pects to the preparation of this
16-point program. It was a student
group, as representative of the al
truistic conscience of the nation,
which undertook to summarize
the aspirations of a people under
Soviet control.
Second, it was a student group
which undertook to disseminate
the program, and thereby sparked
the most widespread revolt
against Soviet totalitarianism
since its inception 44 years ago.
The Hungarian Revolution was
drowned in blood by Soviet tanks,
but it remains, in the inelegant
phraseology of Premier Khrush
chev, “a bone in the throat.”
ALTHOUGH the Communist
rulers of Hungary, backed by the
Soviets, have consistently refused
to permit United Nations observ
ers into the country, through the
famous “Reports of the Special
Committee on the Problem of
Hungary,” issued in 1957, and in
subsequent resolutions, the U.N.
has kept the Hungarian issue alive
as a continuing indictment of the
oppressiveness of Soviet control
of the countries of East Europe.
Hungary has also pointed up
the international hypocrisy of the
Soviet Union, which supports
U.N. resolutions favoring self-de
termination in Asia and Africa
but relentlessly suppresses nat
tional aspirations within its own
sphere of influence.
The students who met in Buda
pest five years ago made a contri
bution to history through their
actions, and a further contribution
to human freedom by their enun
ciation of a democratic manifesto
which has a relevance for all
time.

On Oct. 22, 1956, five years ago
today, students at the University
of Technical Sciences in Budapest
adopted a 16-point program whose
repercussions were destined to be
heard around the world.
The program included demands

for “general elections, universal
suffrage, secret ballot, the parti
cipation of several parties for the
purpose of electing a new Nation
al Assembly, freedom of opinion
and expression, freedom of the
press and a free radio.”
The students also supported the
right to strike and a reorganiza
tion of the country’s economic and
political life so as to encompass
the participation of the mass of
the Hungarian people.
HEADING OFF the students’

proclamation was the demand for
“the immediate withdrawal of all
Soviet troops in accordance with
the provisions of the peace
treaty.”
The students presented a docu
ment containing these demands to
the Budapest Radio, with the re
quest that it be read as part of a
news program.
The radio directors refused to
accept this suggestion, and offered
instead to read only five of the
more noncommittal points. The
censor absolutely refused permis

sections dealing with the with
drawal of Soviet troops, and the
demands for free press and free
elections.

Soviets, have consistently refused
to permit United Nations observ
ers into the country, through the
famous “Reports of the Special
Committee on the Problem of
Hungary,” issued in 1957, and in
subsequent resolutions, the U.N.
has kept the Hungarian issue alive
as a continuing indictment of the
oppressiveness of Soviet control
of the countries of East Europe.
Hungary has also pointed up
the international hypocrisy of the
Soviet Union, which supports
U.N. resolutions favoring self-de
termination in Asia and Africa
but relentlessly suppresses nat
tional aspirations within its own
sphere of influence.
The students who met in Buda
pest five years ago made a contri
bution to history through their
actions, and a further contribution
to human freedom by their enun
ciation of a democratic manifesto
which has a relevance for all
time.
