# CAMPUS OPINION
## U.S. Must Strive for Better World' for All 
### BV GENE HUNN 
Mr. Wyatt’s criticism of my
pacifist stand expressed in his let
ter last Friday is founded on this
assumption: that the Russian so
ciety “has as its one ideal—sub
mission,” or that the sole purpose
of the Communist government is
the destruction of the American
way of life.
In other words, Mr. Wyatt con
ceives of the Russians as being
not human beings but a mysteri
ous sort of monster which stands
12 feet tall and eats babies, especi
ally American babies, for break
fast.
Though admittedly I have had
no close contact with Russian
Communists, I believe, in contrast
to Mr. Wyatt, that the Russian
people, and their leaders included,
are basically human beings with
desires, needs, and faults similar
to mine.
IN OTHER words, first of all
they desire sufficient food and
shelter for a comfortable life, and
second, they need and desire the
freedom to express themselves
creatively.
Having expressed this concept
of humanity I am ready to take
issue with Mr. Wyatt’s next as
sumption: that if we were to uni
laterally disarm, Russia would
walk into New York with her sol
diers and take over the country
forcing a Communist rule upon
us which would result in “a stag
nant and ever rotting human soci
ety which is afraid to think, much
less to do.”
I am convinced that this would
be a physical impossibility. To
control the minds and actions of
three billion people, especially in
view of the fact that a fair per
centage of these people have a
long background of democratic
thought and a very high standard
of living, would require a tremen
dous occupying force.
AND THE FORCE would have
to consist of robots that would be
insensible to humanitarian emo
tions. This force does not exist in
today’s world.
Therefore, I believe that the
new society (after disarmament)
would eventually adopt that social
system which would best provide
for the basic human needs and de

sires.
In other words, I think that
democracy and the ideals of in
dividual liberty would eventually
triumph throughout the world.
And if they failed to do so it would
be only because a majority of hu
man beings desired something dif
ferent.
IN SUM THEN, all men, wheth
er black, white, or yellow, Russian
or American, are human beings
whose first desire is for life.
With this in mind let us strive,
as individuals, for the positive
goal of a better world based on
this assumption rather than striv
ing for the negative goal of pro
tecting America’s precious ideals
at any cost from the snapping
jaws of its “predators.”

whose first desire is for life.
With this in mind let us strive,
as individuals, for the positive
goal of a better world based on
this assumption rather than striv
ing for the negative goal of pro
tecting America’s precious ideals
at any cost from the snapping
jaws of its “predators.”
Mr. Wyatt’s criticism of my
pacifist stand expressed in his let
ter last Friday is founded on this
assumption: that the Russian so
ciety “has as its one ideal—sub
mission,” or that the sole purpose
of the Communist government is
the destruction of the American
way of life.
In other words, Mr. Wyatt con
ceives of the Russians as being
not human beings but a mysteri
ous sort of monster which stands
12 feet tall and eats babies, especi
ally American babies, for break
fast.
Though admittedly I have had
no close contact with Russian
Communists, I believe, in contrast
to Mr. Wyatt, that the Russian
people, and their leaders included,
are basically human beings with
desires, needs, and faults similar
to mine.
IN OTHER words, first of all
they desire sufficient food and
shelter for a comfortable life, and
second, they need and desire the
freedom to express themselves
creatively.
Having expressed this concept
of humanity I am ready to take
issue with Mr. Wyatt’s next as
sumption: that if we were to uni
laterally disarm, Russia would
walk into New York with her sol
diers and take over the country
forcing a Communist rule upon
us which would result in “a stag
nant and ever rotting human soci
ety which is afraid to think, much
less to do.”
I am convinced that this would
be a physical impossibility. To
control the minds and actions of
three billion people, especially in
view of the fact that a fair per
centage of these people have a
long background of democratic
thought and a very high standard
of living, would require a tremen
dous occupying force.
AND THE FORCE would have
to consist of robots that would be
insensible to humanitarian emo
tions. This force does not exist in
today’s world.
Therefore, I believe that the
new society (after disarmament)
would eventually adopt that social
system which would best provide
for the basic human needs and de

sires.
In other words, I think that
democracy and the ideals of in
dividual liberty would eventually
triumph throughout the world.
And if they failed to do so it would
be only because a majority of hu
man beings desired something dif
ferent.
IN SUM THEN, all men, wheth
er black, white, or yellow, Russian
or American, are human beings
whose first desire is for life.
