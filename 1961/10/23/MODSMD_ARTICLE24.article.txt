BIG GAME OVERNIGHT
Editor, The, Daily:
Full moon being Monday night,
I feel moved to make a brief com
ment on the sexual enlightenment
of Stanford freshmen.
At (he start of this quarter,
when still somewhat inclined to
conform to the image of the col
lege student, I and 35 other fresh
man men in house meeting were
told of the joys of the Big Game
Overnight.
After supper one of our spon
sors, leaning on the mantel, said
to an impressionable audience
that the overnight would be in a
motel with connecting rooms.
Another sponsor, from his seat
on the floor, soberly informed us
that California state laws require
pharmacists to sell contraceptives
to anyone, regardless of age and
that we need not hesitate,
1 do not wish to discuss the
ethics of contraceptives or pre
marital relations. I do object to
the manner in which this informa
tion was presented because it
seemed to mo to imply that full
participation in the Big Game
Overnight is expected of all fresh
men.
