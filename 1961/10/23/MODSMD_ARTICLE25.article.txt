ANTI-COMMUNIST RALLY
Editor, The Daily:
(Derek ) Davis objects first to a
“semi-fascist assumption of na
tional infallibility” which (he
claims) set the spirit of the rally
in L.A. “National infallibility” has
nothing to do with the justifica
tion for denouncing our self-avow
ed mortal enemy, Communism.
When any power declares itself
to be bent on the total destruction
of our way of life, it is time to
decide which side you are on, re
gardless of the possible fallibility
of this side—there is no middle
ground of convictions.
Furthermore, it is not “monu
mental stupidity” to state that,
from our point of view, “there is
nothing good about Communism.”
Communism in its present state
is an entity, posed in opposition to
freedom. It is not a shaded mix
ture of good and bad—how can
you see good in a bullet speeding
toward your brain, even if it is
made of pure gold? Or perhaps
Mr. Davis would care to tell us
just what good he does see in
Communism?
Anri if the only two alternatives
which he can conceive assuming
that Communism is all bad, are
“retreat into a mental cocoon” or
immediate aggressive atomic at
tack, then he is imperceptive in
deed of the greater efficacy and
greater sanity of a more moderate
method of ideological warfare:
education.
About Davis’ libelous ridicule of
Dr. Schwarz, little need be said
except that his accusations are
totally unsupported.
If we are made Hitlers by our
gestures and elocution, God help
us all! If Mr. Davis deems these
two points cause enough to brand
Dr. Schwarz a modern Hitler, God
help Mr. Davis!
Let Mr. Davis choose either
American Democracy or Commu
nism—and say so!, for by criticiz
ing American anti-Communist
feeling, he is placing himself in a
position sympathetic to Commu
nism. Which side are you on, Mr.
Davis?

Communism?
Anri if the only two alternatives
which he can conceive assuming
that Communism is all bad, are
“retreat into a mental cocoon” or
immediate aggressive atomic at
tack, then he is imperceptive in
deed of the greater efficacy and
greater sanity of a more moderate
method of ideological warfare:
education.
About Davis’ libelous ridicule of
Dr. Schwarz, little need be said
except that his accusations are
totally unsupported.
If we are made Hitlers by our
gestures and elocution, God help
us all! If Mr. Davis deems these
two points cause enough to brand
Dr. Schwarz a modern Hitler, God
help Mr. Davis!
Let Mr. Davis choose either
American Democracy or Commu
nism—and say so!, for by criticiz
ing American anti-Communist
feeling, he is placing himself in a
position sympathetic to Commu
nism. Which side are you on, Mr.
Davis?

ANTI-COMMUNIST RALLY
Editor, The Daily:
(Derek ) Davis objects first to a
“semi-fascist assumption of na
tional infallibility” which (he
claims) set the spirit of the rally
in L.A. “National infallibility” has
nothing to do with the justifica
tion for denouncing our self-avow
ed mortal enemy, Communism.
When any power declares itself
to be bent on the total destruction
of our way of life, it is time to
decide which side you are on, re
gardless of the possible fallibility
of this side—there is no middle
ground of convictions.
Furthermore, it is not “monu
mental stupidity” to state that,
from our point of view, “there is
nothing good about Communism.”
Communism in its present state
is an entity, posed in opposition to
freedom. It is not a shaded mix
ture of good and bad—how can
you see good in a bullet speeding
toward your brain, even if it is
made of pure gold? Or perhaps
Mr. Davis would care to tell us
just what good he does see in
Communism?
Anri if the only two alternatives
which he can conceive assuming
that Communism is all bad, are
“retreat into a mental cocoon” or
immediate aggressive atomic at
tack, then he is imperceptive in
deed of the greater efficacy and
greater sanity of a more moderate
method of ideological warfare:
education.
