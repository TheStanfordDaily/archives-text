# South Viet Nam Needs U.S. Help—Ambassador
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) South
Viet Nam’s ambassador to the
United States said yesterday it
would be just as useful to dis
patch American troops to his Com
munist-threatened nation as it

would be to send them to Berlin. 1
But Ambassador Tran Van Chu- (
ong declined to speculate on i
whether President Kennedy’s per- 1
sonal military adviser, Gen. Max- 1
well D. Taylor, would recommend

the use of U.S. troops to help
crush growing Communist attacks
in South Viet Nam. Taylor now is
touring the Southeast Asian coun
try.
Tran Van Chuong left no doubt

that he felt South Viet Nam need
ed at least some form of help from
the United States to survive
against the Red guerrilla raids he
said were backed by “the whole
Communist world.”
