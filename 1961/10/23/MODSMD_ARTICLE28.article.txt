## 'T.D.' LODATO DOUBLES Ragsdale Sparks Frosh To 33-6 Win over SJS 
### TOM PARKER 
Dick Ragsdale sparked the
freshman football team to their
first win of the season over San
Jose Slate Frosh, 33-6, Saturday.
Ragsdale passed, pitched out
and ran, for a total of 203 yards,
being directly responsible for one
TD and playing a key role in three
more.
Halfback Morrison Warren ran
better than 20 yards through a
gap in the Spartan line for the
fifth Stanford touchdown. His 3.8
rushing average in six carries
made him a serious threat to the
Spartan defense.
J. D. Lodato, a halt from San
Andreas, scored twice for the
Papooses, both times on a pitch
out from Ragsdale followed by a
sprint flown the sidelines. Lodato
was the leading ground gainer aft
er Ragsdale, going 77 yards in
three carries.
The first Stanford touchdown
came when Ragsdale, faked to the
halfback going around end and
then rolled out and ran through
a surprised Spartan defense for
76 yards to the SJS goal. This was
the longest run from the line of
scrimmge by any Stanford back
this season.
The defensive line walked right
over the Spartan forward wall and
held SJS to just 35 yards on the
ground.
Coach Dan Stavely’s halfbacks
who “just weren’t running’’ last
game, came through with a fine
offensive effort, racking up a
total of 144 yards rushing.
Stanford fumbles were the only
thing that marred a near perfect
game. The Papooses lost the ball
five times, twice within their own
fifteen yard line.
Papoose passing, although ac
counting for 110 yards of the 368-
yard total Stanford gain, wasn’t
as good as hoped for with fifteen
attempts and six completions. All
six of these completions were by
quarterback Ragsdale. Ragsdale’s
32-yard pass to Braden Beck gave
the frosh iheir second TD with
only thirteen seconds remaining
in the half.
Conversions, one of which could
have won last week’s game, ac

counted for three points this
game, all off the boot of end Beck.
Taking advantage of their of
fensive power throughout the
game especially in the second and
third quarters, the frosh team
showed a great deal of strength—
strength that will be needed in
Saturday’s encounter with a
strong UCLA frosh, and the fol
lowing week in the Little Big
Game with Cal to be played in
Berkeley.
