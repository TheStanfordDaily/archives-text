HEAD YELL LEADER ASPIRANTS Judy Levin and Gracie Daniels pose in their cheering section garb
as preparation for their coming campaign. Miss Levin, holding her feathers, says, "If elected, the
fans will see more of me next fall.” Miss Daniels, cousin of former head yell leader Bill Kartozian,
countered, “If I am elected, there will be a re-birth of the Golden Age of Kartozianism.”
