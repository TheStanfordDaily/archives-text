# Poloists Bow to Southland Teams
## 
### 
Stanfordâ€™s varsity water polo
team bit off a little more than
they could chew as they bowed to
two powerhouses from the south
in USC and Fullerton Junior Col
lege last weekend.

The Indians ran into a fast,
sharp-shooting Trojan squad on
Friday and bowed 13-7. The SC at
tack, sparked by Chuck Blttick, a
member of the United States
Olympic team in 1960, tallied four
quick goals in the first period and
was never headed.
Bittick came through with five
goals for the afternoon, while
Dennis Rounsaville and Perry
Lindberg scored two each.
The Indians were led by an
Olympian of their own, George
Harrison, who added two to the
Stanford total. Pete Pettigrew
also tallied two in the losing
effort.
Saturday the Indians made a
better game of it, keeping pace
with the speedy Fullerton squad
until the third period. Then the
southerners broke loose, piling up
three goals while holding the In

dians scoreless. They added one in
the final period and won 8-5.
Bill Lorton kept the Cards in the
game with three goals, and Bob
Spence tossed in two.
Coach Jim Gaughran attributed
the loss to poor passing and prom
ised that the team would work on
the phase of the game in practice
sessions.
The Stanford Frosh knocked off

a couple of highly-rated high
school teams in Sequoia and Men
lo-Atherton. Marty Hull, a Se
quoia graduate, sunk his former
teammates with six goals as he
led the Papooses to a 24-8 victory.
Saturday it was Bryan Beck
who scored six to clear the way
for a 10-6 Stanford triumph. With
the win over MA the frosh ran
their unblemished record to 5-0.
