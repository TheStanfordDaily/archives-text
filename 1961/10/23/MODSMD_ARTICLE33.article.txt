permission to play at the last min
ute, tied up the score 2-2 in the

half.
The score remained tied 2-2 un
til there were eight minutes left
in (he contest. Then the deluge.
After the game, the coaches and
referees picked Nnoli, Andah, and
Chukwudbe as Stanford’s out
standing men. For Cal, the best
were Enrique Escardo, who scored
two goals, and Guiseppi Franco,

Poor luck continue to plague the
Stanford soccer team. Saturday
the booters were shot down 5-2 by
the Cal Aggies in a game they had
in the bag till the closing minutes
of the last period.
The Aggies were tied 2-2 with
eight minutes left in the game,
when Card halfback Edgar Ber
ner, the spark of the Stanford
squad, touched a shot in the pen
alty area, giving the Aggies a
penalty kick. The kick was good
and Cal started a rally which
ended with three sudden goals in
the final minutes.
The defense just fell apart. In
dian soccer coach Fred Priddle
figured that four of the Aggie
goals were unearned. The Aggies
were lacking considerably in fun
damentals, unable to correctly
head or trap the ball. Two goals
came as a result of Aggie offsides
that weren’t spotted by the of
ficials.
Priddle said that the goal tend
ing for the Cards was poor. Stan
ford’s two best goalies were side

lined with injuries. The Aggies’
goalie played a spectacular game,
saving the poor Cal backs time
after time.

Priddle was very impressed by
the work of his African forward
line, Emmanuel Andah, Larry
Chukwudtae, Albert Nnoli and
Mike Ero.

with the aid of a beautiful cross
field pass from Pete Magowan.
