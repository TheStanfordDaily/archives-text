# Husky Speed Hurt Us' Laments Jack Curtice
## 
### 
“I was worried about that Wash
ington backfield speed. It’s hard
to contain those fast backs that
long.” That’s how not-so-smiling
Jack Curtice summed up his
team’s effort against a keyed up
Washington eleven Saturday.
He was referring to a 44-yard
hurst by halfback Bill Siler in the
fourth quarter that iced the game
for the Huskies. Siler along with
teammates John Stiger, and Mar
tin Wyatt led a 225-yard Washing
ton ground offensive.
“I thought our defense was
good, but we were doing a poor
job on offense. Our quarterbacks’
hall handling was off and our of
fense was the worst we’ve shown
all year,” Cactus Jack lamented.
Their pass defense would not have
bothered us if our passing had
been any good.” The Indians to
talled just 98 yards through the
air completing 8 of 24.
In re-evaluating the Big Five
race Stanford’s head man said, “I
say now the same thing I said be
fore the season started. UCLA.
USC, and Washington seemed to
have the best material in the Big
Five. I’ve got 34 sophomores and
only seven seniors.”
Curtice isn’t overly optimistic
about the ’62 Rose Bowl Game. ‘T
think Michigan State is the best
team I’ve ever seen. They are
easily ahead of anybody in the Big
Five.”

Washington Coach Jim Owens
was elated. “We were really up
for this game after last week. The
kids knew they should have won,”
he said. “We stopped their run
ning game consistently."
