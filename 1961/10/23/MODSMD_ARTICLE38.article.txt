SEATTLE. Wash. Washing
lon’s speedy Huskies capitalized
on a couple of key Stanford mis
take's to win their first Big Five
victory 13-0 before .13,200 fans
Saturday.
Tlte Indians, still showing the
same determined defense that has
carried them to three victories,
couldn’t move against the Hus
kies. They relied heavily on their
passing game which broke down
after an early first-quarter spurt.
THE OPENING period was all
Stanford, the Cards rolling up
four first downs while holding the
Huskies to none. Washington
never got further than their own
45, while the Indians moved easily
between the thirty-yard line
stripes.
As the quarter ended Stanford
was in the middle of a drive which
stalled on the Washington 23. Stan
Lindskog, the Cards left-footed
three-point specialist, tried one
from 35 yards out which fell short
and to the left. That was as close
as the Indians came to scoring all
day.
The Huskies came to life late in
the period when Jim Stiger inter
cepted a Steve Thurlow aerial and
ran it back six yards to the Stan
ford 37. Thi-s marked the deepest
penetration for the Huskies to!
that point.
QUARTERBACK Phil Ohler j
took charge, sending Stiger and I
Martin Wyatt off tackle and |

[around the ends. Then on the 14
| when the Card defense stiffened,
he stepped back and hit Wyatt
with a 12-yard sideline flare pass
that pul the ball on the two. On j
the next play the husky junior
went over on a keeper.
Center Roy Mansfield booted I
the extra point, marking the first
time in ten tries that the Huskies I
had scoied a one-point conversion.
Washington started its only sus- i
tained drive of the day as the third j
quarter opened, moving from!
their own 33 to the Stanford 29.
Stiger, who ran for 94 yards over- j
all, was the key man in the march j
as he picked his way through |
Stanford’s porous line time and
again.
THE BID failed when Ohler’s
pass into the flat was intercepted
by George Honore who ran it back
five yards to the 27.
The second fatal Stanford mis
take came late in the third quarter
as the Cards were driving for
what appeared to be a certain
score. Thurlow, running the j
option with perfection, moved the
ball from his own 29 to the Wash
ington 33. He twice pitched to
halfback Stan Lindskog for gains
of 12 and seven yards.
Then the talented sophomore
hit end Steve Pursell on the 14,
but the pass was low and after
Pursell made a sensationa l twist
ing catch, he lost the handle and
Kermit Jorgenson recovered for
the Huskies.

STIGKB and Wyatt continued to
riddle the Stanford lino, picking
up yards in chunks of six and
eight. Finally sophomore speed
ster Bill Siler took a pitch-out
from Ohler, followed good block
ing around right end, and burst
into the open. He dashed 44 yards
without a hand being laid on him.
Mansfield’s boot was blocked.
Stanford continued to throw for
the remainder of the game, but no
one of the three alternating quar
terbacks seemed to click.
For the Huskies it meant a re
vival of their chances to repeat as
the Big Five’s Rose Bowl repre
sentative. They will still have to
beat USC and UCLA to do it
though. For the Indians it was a
tough one to swallow. With Cal’s
“ictory over the Huskies last
weekend and its loss to USC on
Saturday, the Indians again ap
pear to be the weak sister in (he
conference.
THKIK DKFKNSK held up until
the Huskies began utilizing their
speed with sweeps and pilch-outs
to the outside. This loosened up
the middle just enough for the
hard-running Stiger to burst
through.
The Indians were outgained on
the ground 255 to H9 anti man
aged only 98 through the air.
Washington's offensive st a r
Charlie Mitchell played very little
and is still hampered by an in
jury. He carried just five times
but' averaged 7.4 yards a trip.
Wyatt and Stiger each picked up
49 yards for the Husky cause.

Stanford, the Cards rolling up
four first downs while holding the
Huskies to none. Washington
never got further than their own
45, while the Indians moved easily
between the thirty-yard line
stripes.
As the quarter ended Stanford
was in the middle of a drive which
stalled on the Washington 23. Stan
Lindskog, the Cards left-footed
three-point specialist, tried one
from 35 yards out which fell short
and to the left. That was as close
as the Indians came to scoring all
day.
The Huskies came to life late in
the period when Jim Stiger inter
cepted a Steve Thurlow aerial and
ran it back six yards to the Stan
ford 37. Thi-s marked the deepest
penetration for the Huskies to!
that point.
QUARTERBACK Phil Ohler j
took charge, sending Stiger and I
Martin Wyatt off tackle and |

[around the ends. Then on the 14
| when the Card defense stiffened,
he stepped back and hit Wyatt
with a 12-yard sideline flare pass
that pul the ball on the two. On j
the next play the husky junior
went over on a keeper.
Center Roy Mansfield booted I
the extra point, marking the first
time in ten tries that the Huskies I
had scoied a one-point conversion.
Washington started its only sus- i
tained drive of the day as the third j
quarter opened, moving from!
their own 33 to the Stanford 29.
Stiger, who ran for 94 yards over- j
all, was the key man in the march j
as he picked his way through |
Stanford’s porous line time and
again.
THE BID failed when Ohler’s
pass into the flat was intercepted
by George Honore who ran it back
five yards to the 27.
The second fatal Stanford mis
take came late in the third quarter
as the Cards were driving for
what appeared to be a certain
score. Thurlow, running the j
option with perfection, moved the
ball from his own 29 to the Wash
ington 33. He twice pitched to
halfback Stan Lindskog for gains
of 12 and seven yards.
Then the talented sophomore
hit end Steve Pursell on the 14,
but the pass was low and after
Pursell made a sensationa l twist
ing catch, he lost the handle and
Kermit Jorgenson recovered for
the Huskies.

STIGKB and Wyatt continued to
riddle the Stanford lino, picking
up yards in chunks of six and
eight. Finally sophomore speed
ster Bill Siler took a pitch-out
from Ohler, followed good block
ing around right end, and burst
into the open. He dashed 44 yards
without a hand being laid on him.
Mansfield’s boot was blocked.
Stanford continued to throw for
the remainder of the game, but no
one of the three alternating quar
terbacks seemed to click.
For the Huskies it meant a re
vival of their chances to repeat as
the Big Five’s Rose Bowl repre
sentative. They will still have to
beat USC and UCLA to do it
though. For the Indians it was a
tough one to swallow. With Cal’s
“ictory over the Huskies last
weekend and its loss to USC on
Saturday, the Indians again ap
pear to be the weak sister in (he
conference.
THKIK DKFKNSK held up until
the Huskies began utilizing their
speed with sweeps and pilch-outs
to the outside. This loosened up
the middle just enough for the
hard-running Stiger to burst
through.
The Indians were outgained on
the ground 255 to H9 anti man
aged only 98 through the air.
Washington's offensive st a r
Charlie Mitchell played very little
and is still hampered by an in
jury. He carried just five times
but' averaged 7.4 yards a trip.
Wyatt and Stiger each picked up
49 yards for the Husky cause.

The Huskies came to life late in
the period when Jim Stiger inter
cepted a Steve Thurlow aerial and
ran it back six yards to the Stan
ford 37. Thi-s marked the deepest
penetration for the Huskies to!
that point.
QUARTERBACK Phil Ohler j
took charge, sending Stiger and I
Martin Wyatt off tackle and |

[around the ends. Then on the 14
| when the Card defense stiffened,
he stepped back and hit Wyatt
with a 12-yard sideline flare pass
that pul the ball on the two. On j
the next play the husky junior
went over on a keeper.
Center Roy Mansfield booted I
the extra point, marking the first
time in ten tries that the Huskies I
had scoied a one-point conversion.
Washington started its only sus- i
tained drive of the day as the third j
quarter opened, moving from!
their own 33 to the Stanford 29.
Stiger, who ran for 94 yards over- j
all, was the key man in the march j
as he picked his way through |
Stanford’s porous line time and
again.
THE BID failed when Ohler’s
pass into the flat was intercepted
by George Honore who ran it back
five yards to the 27.
The second fatal Stanford mis
take came late in the third quarter
as the Cards were driving for
what appeared to be a certain
score. Thurlow, running the j
option with perfection, moved the
ball from his own 29 to the Wash
ington 33. He twice pitched to
halfback Stan Lindskog for gains
of 12 and seven yards.
Then the talented sophomore
hit end Steve Pursell on the 14,
but the pass was low and after
Pursell made a sensationa l twist
ing catch, he lost the handle and
Kermit Jorgenson recovered for
the Huskies.

STIGKB and Wyatt continued to
riddle the Stanford lino, picking
up yards in chunks of six and
eight. Finally sophomore speed
ster Bill Siler took a pitch-out
from Ohler, followed good block
ing around right end, and burst
into the open. He dashed 44 yards
without a hand being laid on him.
Mansfield’s boot was blocked.
Stanford continued to throw for
the remainder of the game, but no
one of the three alternating quar
terbacks seemed to click.
For the Huskies it meant a re
vival of their chances to repeat as
the Big Five’s Rose Bowl repre
sentative. They will still have to
beat USC and UCLA to do it
though. For the Indians it was a
tough one to swallow. With Cal’s
“ictory over the Huskies last
weekend and its loss to USC on
Saturday, the Indians again ap
pear to be the weak sister in (he
conference.
THKIK DKFKNSK held up until
the Huskies began utilizing their
speed with sweeps and pilch-outs
to the outside. This loosened up
the middle just enough for the
hard-running Stiger to burst
through.
The Indians were outgained on
the ground 255 to H9 anti man
aged only 98 through the air.
Washington's offensive st a r
Charlie Mitchell played very little
and is still hampered by an in
jury. He carried just five times
but' averaged 7.4 yards a trip.
Wyatt and Stiger each picked up
49 yards for the Husky cause.

SEATTLE. Wash. Washing
lon’s speedy Huskies capitalized
on a couple of key Stanford mis
take's to win their first Big Five
victory 13-0 before .13,200 fans
Saturday.
Tlte Indians, still showing the
same determined defense that has
carried them to three victories,
couldn’t move against the Hus
kies. They relied heavily on their
passing game which broke down
after an early first-quarter spurt.
THE OPENING period was all
Stanford, the Cards rolling up
four first downs while holding the
Huskies to none. Washington
never got further than their own
45, while the Indians moved easily
between the thirty-yard line
stripes.
As the quarter ended Stanford
was in the middle of a drive which
stalled on the Washington 23. Stan
Lindskog, the Cards left-footed
three-point specialist, tried one
from 35 yards out which fell short
and to the left. That was as close
as the Indians came to scoring all
day.
