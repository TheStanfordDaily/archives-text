# $1.3 Million Given to SMSG Program Here
## 
### 
Two National Science Founda
tion grants totaling nearly $1,300,-
000 have been awarded to Stan
ford for continuation of the School
Mathematics Study Group.

SMSG, founded in 1958 to im
prove pre-college mathematics
teaching, is headed by Prof. Er
ward G. Begle. Previously located
at Yale, it moved to Stanford this
fall when Begle was raided from
Yale to join the mathematics fac
ulty. It is presently housed in a
new office building adjacent to
the Hansen Laboratories.
THE GROUP HAS invented and
tested a new, more interesting ap
proach to mathematics, and writ
ten textbooks to match for grades
seven through 12. It also has in
preparation a series of supplemen
tary paperbacks for students and
background publications for
teachers.

In addition, the group is work
ing on a revised mathematics cur
riculum for students not headed
for college, investigating the feasi
bility of correspondence courses
for gifted students, and preparing
materials for grades four through
six.

Approximately $1,000,000 of the
current funds will go into continu
ing this work for the next year.
A supplementary grant of $300,-
000 was awarded for extra work
the group wants to undertake,
Begle said.
THE EXTRA WORK falls into
three categories: a study of “pro
grammed” learning in mathemat
ics that involves re-writing some
of the SMSG texts for possible use
in teaching machines; a five-year
study of SMSG learning results
and their effects, if any, on other
curriculum subjects or on later
college work; and translation of

the SMSG tests into Spanish for
use in Puerto Rican schools.
“Our society leans more and
more heavily on science and tech
nology,” said Begle. “The number
of our citizens skilled in mathe
matics must be greatly increased.
Understanding of the role of
mathematics in our society is now
a prerequisite for intelligent citi
zenship.”
SMSG IS TRYING to achieve
this by improving curricula, by
attracting and training more stu
dents who are talented in math,
and by helping teachers who will
give the revitalized math courses.

The group’s basic policy is set
by a board of 25 educators, mat he
malicious, and scientists repre
senting institutions throughout
the nation. Its activities have been
broken down into more than ten
projects, which are directed by
panels of experts including one or
more board members.
The texts have been worked out
in writing sessions held at Stan
ford, Yale and the universities of
Michigan and Colorado. More than
150 specialists from various fields
have participated.
