# Farm Sets High Fire Alarm Record, But Low Record of Pranksters
## 
### 
A record number of alarms was
answered by the Stanford Fire
Department for the academic year
just ended.

Fire Chief John Marston report
ed that while the number of
alarms was high, the cash loss
was only $25,642, a relatively low
figure.

The 22 full-time firemen and 12
student firemen found that the
most frequent non-fire calls were
for first-aid, with “party trapped
in elevator” running a close sec
ond. Of the 24 false alarms, only
eight were malicious, a low per
centage for a university campus.
Most campus building fires
were caused by electrical malfunc

tions. Of 23 grass or brush fires,
only four wore incendiary, the ma
jority wore marked “cause unde
termined.”
The worst loss, about 73 per
cent of the total was in the geog
raphy department of the tempor
ary buildings. Manuscripts and
works belonging to Prof. C. Lang
don White wore destroyed, a loss
valued at $19,944.
