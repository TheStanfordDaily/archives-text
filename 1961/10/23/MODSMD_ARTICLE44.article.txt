# New Parking Lot—Near Quad, Well Paved, But Little Used
## 
### 
Looking for a parking place?
Perhaps you and a lovely now
parking lot should get together.
“We keep getting calls asking
‘where can I park?’” but every
day about 75 parking spaces go
unused in the large new parking
lot across from Moore Hall, says
Police Chief Gordon Davis.

The lot is open to all student
and faculty registered vehicles. It
is within one-and-a-half blocks of
Engineering Corner and is off
street, smoothly paved, and dean,
says Davis.
How do you get there? Coming
from the west end of campus,
drive up Lomita past Roble and
turn down Campus drive and left
into the lot; from the east end of
campus, lake Campus Drive to
' Moore Hall and turn right.
Lots of people park their cars
all day in the lot, which is no far
| ther than a 10-minute walk from
j the most distant place on campus,
Davis said.
