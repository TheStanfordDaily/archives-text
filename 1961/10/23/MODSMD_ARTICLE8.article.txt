# Farm Moon To Produce Women Tonight
## 
### 
The Farm’s traditional biologi
cal change is slated for midnight
tonight as the first full moon of
the year beams down upon Inner
Quad.
Should the tradition of past
years hold forth, several dozen of
Stanford’s co-eds will enter quad
somewhere near midnight. They
will be greeted by anything from
a band to a water bomb.
With each will be a Stanford
man, a senior Stanford man.
The Farm dollies will wander
into the vicinity of the front of
Memorial Church filled with girl
ish glee. But they will leave with
womanly outlooks.
For as Farm lore goes, a female
Stanford student is not a woman
until she has been kissed at mid
night, under a full moon, on inner
quad, in front of Memorial
Church, by a Stanford man.
Not one of the explicit qualifi
cations can be missed; unless all
are fulfilled, the ritual is mean
ingless.
The custom is so explicit in its
details, it becomes almost legal
in character.
Perhaps it was in the will.
