# Four Men Strive For Yell Leader Against Women
## 
### BILL REPPY 
Stanford men came out of their
political holes yesterday en
masse.
Four fraternity men declared
their candidacy for the position of
head yell-leader in a move to save
face for the Stanford male sex.
thoroughly embarrassed for a day
when it appeared that two coeds
were going to be the only candi
dates.
NOMINATION petitions were
submitted for Pete Jackson, Theta
Xi; Roger Solquist, ATO; Edward
“Bino” Creighton, Kappa Sig; and
Jim Nolfi, Theta Delt.
THE PRIMARY elections Nov.
1-2 and the finals Nov. 8-9 will de
cide if women are going to take
another stride in their frightening
march towards equality of the
sexes.

The men will still have to toe
the political battle line with the
tw'o daring dollies, Grade Daniels
and Judy Levin.

Some students speculated that
Judy and Grade declared their
candidacy for head yell-leader
merely to scare up a male or two
for the traditionally masculine
role. Grade said she thought it
“very rewarding that so many re
sponded to the call.”
BUT BOTH girls told the Daily
last night that they were not go
ing to drop out of the race. The
resulting campaign could be spec
tacular. The race for head yell
leader has been known to degen
erate into a who-has-the-most
gross-humor contest, and with
men vs. women, they could pull
out all the stops.
So far the men’s campaign state
ments have been mild. Pete Jack
son stated; “As a fraternity broth
er of Kartozian I know there’ll
never be another like him, but
something new could go over with
the originality of Kartozian’s
ideas.”

(The ghost of the renowned
figure in trench coat, hat, and
cigar continues to haunt this cam
paign: Grade Daniels maintains
that as Kartozian’s cousin she is

the natural candidate to revive the
“golden age” of yell-leading.)
CREIGHTON told the Daily his
nomination petition was submit
ted as an RF on him and that he
was “not a candidate.” His name
will not appear on the ballot.
Asked how he felt about the of
fice of head yell-leader, Jim Nolfi
had only this terse reply: “A good
pom pom boy is a crude pom pom
boy.”
Soquist was not available for
comment.
A rash of nominations doubled
the ranks of Stanford politicos
yesterday, but there are still no
candidates for LASSU representa
tive from Branner and freshman
vice president.
FIFTEEN petitions were re
ceived by Elections Commission
Chairman Chuck Bischoff yester
day to bring to 30 the number of
candidates seeking 14 positions.
Nominations close today at 5
p.m. Blanks are still available at
the ASSU office in the Union, Bis
choff said.
James Rasmussen, Theta Delt,
Beau Bianchi. Beta and Randy
Devening, Delt, have joined Jon
Hirschoff as candidates for men’s
council.

THREE NEW candidates for
freshman class president are
Brooke Taylor, Rinconada; Thom
as B, Coleman, Stern; and Biff
Barker, Madera.
Anne Osborn has filed as a can
didate for LASSU representative

against Ann Evans. John Ward
MacDonald, Crothers Memorial,
is seeking re-election to LASSU
fi’om the graduate schools of Hu
manities and Sciences and Mineral
Sciences.

only one to file for LASSU repre

School of Engineering.

THE PRIMARY elections Nov.
1-2 and the finals Nov. 8-9 will de
cide if women are going to take
another stride in their frightening
march towards equality of the
sexes.

The men will still have to toe
the political battle line with the
tw'o daring dollies, Grade Daniels
and Judy Levin.

Some students speculated that
Judy and Grade declared their
candidacy for head yell-leader
merely to scare up a male or two
for the traditionally masculine
role. Grade said she thought it
“very rewarding that so many re
sponded to the call.”
BUT BOTH girls told the Daily
last night that they were not go
ing to drop out of the race. The
resulting campaign could be spec
tacular. The race for head yell
leader has been known to degen
erate into a who-has-the-most
gross-humor contest, and with
men vs. women, they could pull
out all the stops.
So far the men’s campaign state
ments have been mild. Pete Jack
son stated; “As a fraternity broth
er of Kartozian I know there’ll
never be another like him, but
something new could go over with
the originality of Kartozian’s
ideas.”

(The ghost of the renowned
figure in trench coat, hat, and
cigar continues to haunt this cam
paign: Grade Daniels maintains
that as Kartozian’s cousin she is

the natural candidate to revive the
“golden age” of yell-leading.)
CREIGHTON told the Daily his
nomination petition was submit
ted as an RF on him and that he
was “not a candidate.” His name
will not appear on the ballot.
Asked how he felt about the of
fice of head yell-leader, Jim Nolfi
had only this terse reply: “A good
pom pom boy is a crude pom pom
boy.”

last night that they were not go
ing to drop out of the race. The
resulting campaign could be spec
tacular. The race for head yell
leader has been known to degen
erate into a who-has-the-most
gross-humor contest, and with
men vs. women, they could pull
out all the stops.
So far the men’s campaign state
ments have been mild. Pete Jack
son stated; “As a fraternity broth
er of Kartozian I know there’ll
never be another like him, but
something new could go over with
the originality of Kartozian’s
ideas.”

(The ghost of the renowned
figure in trench coat, hat, and
cigar continues to haunt this cam
paign: Grade Daniels maintains
that as Kartozian’s cousin she is

the natural candidate to revive the
“golden age” of yell-leading.)
CREIGHTON told the Daily his
nomination petition was submit
ted as an RF on him and that he
was “not a candidate.” His name
will not appear on the ballot.
Asked how he felt about the of
fice of head yell-leader, Jim Nolfi
had only this terse reply: “A good
pom pom boy is a crude pom pom
boy.”
Soquist was not available for
comment.

dates.
NOMINATION petitions were
submitted for Pete Jackson, Theta
Xi; Roger Solquist, ATO; Edward
“Bino” Creighton, Kappa Sig; and
Jim Nolfi, Theta Delt.
THE PRIMARY elections Nov.
1-2 and the finals Nov. 8-9 will de
cide if women are going to take
another stride in their frightening
march towards equality of the
sexes.

The men will still have to toe
the political battle line with the
tw'o daring dollies, Grade Daniels
and Judy Levin.

Some students speculated that
Judy and Grade declared their
candidacy for head yell-leader
merely to scare up a male or two
for the traditionally masculine
role. Grade said she thought it
“very rewarding that so many re
sponded to the call.”
