EDITOR’S NOTE: The Daily to

questions and answers concerning
Stanford. Students having a ques

are urged to send it to Bov 3151,

persons most qualified to answer.
QUESTION; What are the opin
ions of the dean of men concern
ing pre-sophomore rush?
Answered by Dean of Men Wil
liam G. Craig.
“After the freshman year, Stan
ford students have four choices as
to where they will live for the
next three years. These choices
are (1) Stern houses, (2) eating
clubs, (3) fraternities, and (4) off
campus.
“ANY system of rushing, or co
opting members, should minimize
disruption to the academic pro
gram of the University, provide
the best possible circumstances in
which the individual student
makes his choice, and finally,
guarantee as equitable a proce
dure as possible for the groups
participating in rush.
“The present program penalizes
the freshman houses and the
Stern houses unduly. The problem
arises in how to effect changes in
the rushing system without hurt
ing fraternities and clubs.
“Most are committed to a sys
tem of deferred rushing the
question is when. A new proposal,
calling for rushing just prior to
registration of the sophomore
year, has considerable merit.
“IT ALLOWS the freshman

house system to mature without
dividing individual loyalties at the
beginning of spring quarter, dis
rupting both the freshman houses
and the fraternities with pledge
sneaks, increasing freshman
abuses of alcohol and practically
wiping out two weeks of academic
work at the start of spring quar
ter.

“(For those who ask ‘What is
the freshman house system,’ let
me refer you to Stanford Universi
ty Bulletin—lnformation—l96l—
91.)
“There are several bad aspects
of the present rushing program,
among them the unnatural ‘no
contact’ rule (which should be
eliminated) and the expensive off
campus parties.
“PROPER CONTACT appears
unenforceable when pledging oc
curs during the first year.
“It is my hope that Inter-Fra
ternity Council and Inter-Club
Council will give this proposal
careful thought. Eating clubs and
fraternities are strong, tradition
ally established social groups at
Stanford and are steadily becom
ing stronger.

“It’s difficult to see how either
can be hurt by the sophomore
rush proposal and it’s clear that
other groups are being hurt by
the present system.

“THERE are formidable but not
unsurmounlable administrative
problems connected with such a
change and sacrifices of student
vacation and work time.

“The pros and cons need to be
weighed carefully and a decision
made on the basis of what is best
for the individual student.”
