DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS
Editor, The Daily:
Gene Hunn summed up the dis
armament question very well in
his value judgment: America and
its way of life mean nothing on a
lifeless planet.
However, war is not certain —it
is only probable. Its probability
decreases as we find less violent
ways to extend our institutions.
If we can convince the non-Com
munist world that our social, po
litical and economic systems are
superior to all others we will have
solved the Communist problem at
its origin—without war.
There are two reasons why we
cannot convince these undecided
nations: (1) our institutions are
defective, (2) therefore, we can
not operate an effective sales cam
paign.
Our central government is so
ham-strung by congenital weak
ness that executive programs such
as the Alliance for Progress and
other grass-roots selling jobs are
cut badly by selfish minorities. A
simple majority in the House
Rules Committee can veto a bill.
That veto is absolute: The Presi
dent cannot over-ride it.
Goldwater, Buckley, Welch and
the Dixiecrats all want a weak
central government; however,
they want it weak for different
reasons. Goldwaterism demands
freedom from taxation and Feder
al spending.
Buckley’s Catholic minority de
mands freedom from Federal
spending—unless it is on Catholic
schools. Welch wants government
small and non-Communist—like
his candy factory. And the Dixie
crats want the central government
weak so the state governments
can get the slaves back to the
plantations.
Any one of these groups, or a
grizzly coalition of all four, still
represents less than half the peo
ple in this nation. And yet, if they
get into the key legislative posi
tions they can obstruct central
government programs at will.
James Madison foresaw this prob
lem and wrote Federalist No. 48
to warn against it. Read it, it de
scribes the situation today.
We cannot mount a progressive
extension of our democratic in
stitutions until they are amended
to work freely and efficiently.

If we can convince the non-Com
munist world that our social, po
litical and economic systems are
superior to all others we will have
solved the Communist problem at
its origin—without war.
There are two reasons why we
cannot convince these undecided
nations: (1) our institutions are
defective, (2) therefore, we can
not operate an effective sales cam
paign.
Our central government is so
ham-strung by congenital weak
ness that executive programs such
as the Alliance for Progress and
other grass-roots selling jobs are
cut badly by selfish minorities. A
simple majority in the House
Rules Committee can veto a bill.
That veto is absolute: The Presi
dent cannot over-ride it.
Goldwater, Buckley, Welch and
the Dixiecrats all want a weak
central government; however,
they want it weak for different
reasons. Goldwaterism demands
freedom from taxation and Feder
al spending.
Buckley’s Catholic minority de
mands freedom from Federal
spending—unless it is on Catholic
schools. Welch wants government
small and non-Communist—like
his candy factory. And the Dixie
crats want the central government
weak so the state governments
can get the slaves back to the
plantations.
Any one of these groups, or a
grizzly coalition of all four, still
represents less than half the peo
ple in this nation. And yet, if they
get into the key legislative posi
tions they can obstruct central
government programs at will.
James Madison foresaw this prob
lem and wrote Federalist No. 48
to warn against it. Read it, it de
scribes the situation today.
We cannot mount a progressive
extension of our democratic in
stitutions until they are amended
to work freely and efficiently.

DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS
Editor, The Daily:
Gene Hunn summed up the dis
armament question very well in
his value judgment: America and
its way of life mean nothing on a
lifeless planet.
However, war is not certain —it
is only probable. Its probability
decreases as we find less violent
ways to extend our institutions.
