# Berlin Police In Tear Gas Tossing Spree

BERLIN (UP!) — A tear gas
battle broke out between Commu
nist and West Berlin police last
night shortly after Western bor
der patrolmen were supplied with
tear gas grenades from Western
Allied stockpiles.
West Berlin police headquarters
said Western police officers re
taliated against Communist bor
der guards by hurling six tear gas
grenades after the Communists
threw five grenades into West
Berlin.
THE WESTERN action was de
scribed by a police spokesman as
“very successful.’’
The tear gas action flared as the
United States protested to the
Soviets against Sunday night’s
border incident. Armed American
soldiers for the first time went
into East Berlin Sunday night to
free an American held by Com
munist police at an East-West Ber
lin border checkpoint.
The U.S. soldiers marched into
East Berlin twice to rescue E.
Allen Lightner, head of the U.S.
State Department here.
POLICE said the tear gas ex
change developed at the French
sector border when Communist
police tossed five explosive gas
grenades against a West Berlin
sound truck sending news and
music across the border to the
Communists.
One of the Communist grenades
blow up close to a West Berlin
customs automobile, shattering its
windshield. But three of the five
grenades hurled by the Reds
failed to go off.
Western patrolmen immediately
retaliated by throwing six gren
ades of a non-explosive type under
the bridge where the Communist
officers stood.
