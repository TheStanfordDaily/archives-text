ANTI-COMMUNIST RALLY
Editor, The Daily:
I hope and pray that Holly
wood’s Anti-Communist Rally
does become a threat.
In an article appearing in The
Daily Oct. 18, Derek Davis sug
gests that the “lunatic fringe” was
the group exhibiting itself. He ne
glected to mention that some of
the members of that “fringe” are
James Francis Cardinal Macln
tyre, Cardinal-Archbishop of Los
Angeles; Jack Warner of Warner
Bros.; Nat King Cole; John
Wayne; George Murphy; Jimmy
Stewart; Connie Haines, Walt
Disney; Lloyd Nolan; Andy De
vine; Roy Rogers and Dale Evans;
Walter Brennan; Ronald Regan;
Jane Russell; Pat O’Brjen; Caesar
Romero; Robert Stack; Linda
Darnell and Richard Nixon.
Dr. Fred Schwarz, a Protestant
minister whose phyisognomy was
attacked by Davis, is the same Dr.
Schwarz whose statement on the
dangers of atheistic Communism
was circulated as an insert by The
Stanford Daily about a year or so
ago as recommended reading by
the then senior class.

I think that the reason why
some of these people around Stan
ford, Mr. Davis is an example,
reach some of the preposterous
conclusions they do is that they
understand and possess no abso
lute moral standard. Understand
ing and believing such a code, they
would not reach these fallacies.

Editor, The Daily:
I’m afraid Mr. Millar is going to
run into lots of trouble with his
either-or policy regarding Com
munism, namely that anyone who
criticizes “American anti-Commu
nist feeling” is de facto either a
Communist or a sympathizer.

This means that if I criticize
these so-called Minutemen who
are now holding maneuvers out
side Collinsville, 111,, in the belief
that World War HI has already
started—if I criticize them lam a
Communist sympathizer.
If I criticize the Sunnyvale coun
cilman who would preserve our
freedoms by depriving us of one
of them (namely the freedom to
choose our own reading matter,
not the freedom to read what the
councilman thinks we should
read), then I am a Communist
sympathizer.
All the professors who threaten
ed to resign last year when it was
rumored that Richard Nixon
would become president of Stan
ford—all these men are Commu
nists?

No, Mi\ Millar, gestures and
elocution alone do not make Hit
lers. But add a troubled audience,
almost half-neurotic with fear of
something very few of them know
much about (some of the most
militant anti-Communists don’t
even know where Berlin is, as
shown in a nationwide poll).
This will make the difference
between Dr. Schwarz on a soap
box in Pershing Snare during
lunch hour and Dr. Schwarz be

fore capacity crowds in the L.A.
Sports Arena and Hollywood
Bowl, with television coverage to
six states. This was also the dif
ference between Hitler in the
Munchner Hofbrauhaus and the
Hitler for whom the crowds par
roted “sig Heil.”

PACIFISM
Editor, The Daily:
I could not have missed reading
Mr. Hunn’s article urging the
United States to unilaterally dis
arm; it was surrounded by a brief
account of the Hungarian Revolu
tion which was so mercilessly
quashed by the Soviet Union. Does
this conform to Mr. Hunn’s “con
cept of humanity?”
One could forgive Mr. Hunn for
his naivete were there not so
many instances of the ruthless
ness of Russian rule. Austria,
Hungary, East Germany were
raped after World War II; ma
chines, machinists and factories
wore moved to the east. Does this
conform to Mr. Hunn’s “concept
of humanity?”
Times and leaders have changed
in the Soviet Union, but the Com
munists saw fit to murder five
million Russian peasants in the
twenties and thirties. Does this
conform to Mr. Hunn’s “concept
of humanity?”
I suggest that Mr. Hunn temper
his concept of humanity with
some concept of history. Main
taining empires by brutal methods
is as old as the pyramids and as
young as the Hungarian Revolu
tion; the justification for brutality
is usually couched in terms of
“humanity.”
Michael D. Malfy.
Editor, The Daily:
There must be some reasonable
middle ground between the ex
tremist John Birchers and the self
styled pacifists like Gene Hunn
. . . who advocate unilateral dis
armament by the U.S.A. (why not
Moscow?) on a false assumption
that nuclear war is finis for hu
manity.

I approve The Stanford Daily,
exemplifying the best tradition of
a free press and an independent

university, for printing Mr.
Hunn’s letter, and I defend his
right to state such an opinion.
However, someone must take is
sue with it, preferably not a J.B.
Despite 50- and 100-megaton
bombs a full-scale nuclear war
will neither destroy civilization
nor humanity. Any participating
nation, or any group in a few un
fortunate locations, not prepared
for fallout would certainly for
feit the inheritance in both re
spects—but that would not be the
end of the world.

“On The Beach” was technically
unsound, as testified by informed
nuclear scientists of Edward Tel
ler’s caliber. Mr. Hunn’s pacifism
is to be preferred to the belliger
ance of Nikita Khrushchev and
John Birch, and they appear to be
reasonable men compared to Chou
En-lai.

But what Mr. Hunn proposes
would lead inexorably to the
spread of Communist tyranny
over the world. Then there would
be no free press at Stanford dar
ing to print Mr. Hunn’s final com
plaint that the rest of humanity
was acting selfishly, Moscow and
Peking first, America second, and
he was tired of being denied that
good old Bill of Rights which at
least attempted to protect the in
dividual from invasion by the
state, that to be “an individual in
a world society” is only desirable
when such a society is free of
tyranny.
