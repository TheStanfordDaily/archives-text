# BEAT CAL, USC
## Harriers Lose to Speedy SJS 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
San Jose State’s well-conditioned
cross country squad ran away
from Stanford’s youngsters in the
fourth mile of Saturday’s four
way meet in Strawberry Canyon

at Berkeley. When the scores were
added up, the Spartan harriers
were found to be far ahead with
19 points, trailed by the Indians
with 58, Cal with 72, and USC,
last with 83.

Jeff Fishback of San Jose, with
a lime of 19:21, led the Spartan
squad in one of the finest exam
ples of team running seen in these
parts in a long time. The first five
men on the winning squad fin
ished 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. with only
Julio Marin of USC breaking up
the monotony.
The depth of this squad is indi
cated by the fact that Charlie
Clark, one of the top distance men
in the country, and a member of
the United States National team
which competed in Russia this
summer, was only San Jose’s
third finisher.

WEYM KIRKLAND, the most
promising of the Card frosh, was
the first of the redmen to finish,
in 7th place. Kirkland’s time was
19:54, only a second behind
Clark’s, but he should get even
better.
Paul Schlicke was 9th, Bill Pratt
11th, and Dave Stineback 13th.
John Northway in 18th spot, Har
lan Andrews in 22nd and John
Beck, 25th, rounded out the Indian
team.
Coach Jordan commented that
his squad had a “good lesson in
team running” taught to them by
the victorious Spartans. Instead
of sticking together, the only win
ning strategy in cross country, the
Indians broke up into two groups.
Stanford was not really pre
pared to run four miles, the coach
also pointed out. An easy victory
at three miles had “lulled us into
a false sense of security.” San
Jose had been running four miles
for the last two weeks.
JORDAN singled out Pratt as
the most improved runner in the
last week. Although Kirkland was
first man, he was “not nearly so
sharp” as before, having lost his
form slightly due to a missed
practice.
The results were not as discour
aging as the score sounds. Stan
ford wasn’t ready for such fast
competition, and took a good lick
ing. But it was a necessary lesson,
especially for the freshmen. Last
year the harriers took four
straight heatings to start the year,
yet came on to win the coast
championship.

were found to be far ahead with
19 points, trailed by the Indians
with 58, Cal with 72, and USC,
last with 83.

Jeff Fishback of San Jose, with
a lime of 19:21, led the Spartan
squad in one of the finest exam
ples of team running seen in these
parts in a long time. The first five
men on the winning squad fin
ished 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6. with only
Julio Marin of USC breaking up
the monotony.
The depth of this squad is indi
cated by the fact that Charlie
Clark, one of the top distance men
in the country, and a member of
the United States National team
which competed in Russia this
summer, was only San Jose’s
third finisher.

WEYM KIRKLAND, the most
promising of the Card frosh, was
the first of the redmen to finish,
in 7th place. Kirkland’s time was
19:54, only a second behind
Clark’s, but he should get even
better.
Paul Schlicke was 9th, Bill Pratt
11th, and Dave Stineback 13th.
John Northway in 18th spot, Har
lan Andrews in 22nd and John
Beck, 25th, rounded out the Indian
team.
Coach Jordan commented that
his squad had a “good lesson in
team running” taught to them by
the victorious Spartans. Instead
of sticking together, the only win
ning strategy in cross country, the
Indians broke up into two groups.
Stanford was not really pre
pared to run four miles, the coach
also pointed out. An easy victory
at three miles had “lulled us into
a false sense of security.” San
Jose had been running four miles
for the last two weeks.
JORDAN singled out Pratt as
the most improved runner in the
last week. Although Kirkland was
first man, he was “not nearly so
sharp” as before, having lost his
form slightly due to a missed
practice.
The results were not as discour
aging as the score sounds. Stan
ford wasn’t ready for such fast
competition, and took a good lick
ing. But it was a necessary lesson,
especially for the freshmen. Last
year the harriers took four
straight heatings to start the year,
yet came on to win the coast
championship.
San Jose State’s well-conditioned
cross country squad ran away
from Stanford’s youngsters in the
fourth mile of Saturday’s four
way meet in Strawberry Canyon

at Berkeley. When the scores were
added up, the Spartan harriers
were found to be far ahead with
19 points, trailed by the Indians
with 58, Cal with 72, and USC,
