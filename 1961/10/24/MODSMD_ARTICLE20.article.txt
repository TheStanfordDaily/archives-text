## U.S. Track Lead Cut 
### 
United States dominance in
track and field is likely to be chal
lenged by some determined Euro
pean nations according to Stan
ford assistant track coach Jim
Terrill, just back from a three
month stay in Europe.

Recently invited by Yugoslavia
to help train its national track
team, coach Terrill discovered
thal athletics are a good deal dif
ferent in that country than in the
U.S.
ATHLETIC clubs are the basis
for Yugoslavia’s track program.
Terrill coached at several clubs,
joining with other coaches to train
athletes for the national cham
pionship meet, held last August.
Terrill stated that specialization
and government subsidation are
characteristic of Yugoslavian and
most European track. In Yugo
slavia athletes receive as much as
20,000 denirs ($3O) a month each
to enable them to meet living
costs.

COMMENTING on European
sports in general, Terrill said,
“Pound for pound and man for
man, the Hungarians are the best
athletes in the world. Their small
population has won far more than
its share of sports honors.”
He stated that Europe is now
fully recovered from World War
11, and that increased prosperity
has turned interest to sports.
Terrill felt that some European
coaching was the best anywhere,
and that the United States was
due for some very stiff compe
tition in the future.
