# Med Center Granted $4,015 For Cardiographic Research
## 
### 
The Stanford Medical Center’s
Department of Cardiology has
been granted $4,015 by the Santa
Clara County Heart Association
to study the amount of blood flow
through the human heart muscle.
Dr. Herbert N. Hultgren, asso
ciate professor of medicine at
Stanford, is director of the proj
ect.

The medical center, according
to Dr. Hultgren, has developed a
technique to find how much blood
flows through the blood vessels
that feed the heart muscle, how
far the flow is cut down when a
patient has hardening of the ar
teries, and the effects of a lifetime
of heavy physical labor on coro
nary blood flow. But the technique
so far has only been used in an
isolated heart.

Treatment of heart patients de
pends to some extent on the phy
sician’s judging how much reserve
capacity of blood flow the heart
muscle has, Dr. Hultgren said.
The judgment depends on indirect
methods of measurement such as
the electrocardiograph and medi
cal history of the patient.
The study will attempt to make
these methods more reliable in
use on patients.
The researchers will also study
the effect of heart muscle strain
on heart enlargement.
Dr. Hultgren and his associates
have developed instruments that
can push liquid through an iso
lated post-mortem human heart
at a steady rate, measure what
goes in and what comes out and
the time interval of passage.
