## “Hitch your wagon to a ‘growth’ industry-and grow with it!” 
### 
Douglas Leigh, President

“A growth industry is a new industry that is on the
way up moving quickly, expanding fast. When you
join a company in one of the growth fields you have
something extra working for you ... you grow up with it.
To find out which industry is right for you, try this: Ask
someone in a good investment office to give you a list of
the industries he considers ‘growth industries’. Data

Processing, plastics, and electronics are a few examples.
Then pick the one you have a leaning toward, and get
the names of the most progressive companies in that
field.
One thing I’d like to point out from my own career is
... a growth industry may also be an old business that’s
on the verge of new development. Shortly after leaving
college I found this situation in the Outdoor Advertising
field. What my associates and I did was to employ color,
action and motion to dramatically personify the product,
brand or services being advertised. In doing so, we de
veloped the modern type ‘Spectaculars’ that talked, blew
smoke rings, soap bubbles, etc.... signs that changed the
face of Broadway and the famous Times Square area.
This is just one example. The really important thing
to remember is this: When you set your sights on a career,
aim for an industry that is going to grow, so you can grow
with it. It's the difference between a rocket that blasts
off, and one that just sits there. Good luck!”
