# Hammarskjold, Zulu Awarded Nobel Prizes

### 
OSLO, Norway ( UPI (—The late
U.N. Secretary General Dag Ham
marskjold and a banished South
African Zulu chieftain yesterday
were awarded Nobel Peace prizes.

Hammarskjold, who died in a
plane crash on a peace mission to
the Congo last month, was award
ed the 1961 prize. It was the first
time in the 60-year history of the
awards that a dead man had been
so honored.

THE 1960 PRIZE was awarded
belatedly to native nationalist
leader Albert Luthuli, chief op
ponent to the white supremacy
policies of the South African gov
ernment.

A symbol of resistance to most
Africans, he was banished by the
government to a remote area in
Natal and barred from all politi
cal activities.

The prize money for Hammar
.skjold's award is equivalent to
$50,045, and for Luthuli’s to
$45,190. The amount of the awards
is based on the annual income
from the funds established for the
prizes in 1901.

THE NORWEGIAN Nobel Peace
Prize Committee gave no reason
for the decision to honor Ham
marskjold and Luthuli. But it
noted the latter’s troubles with
the South African government
and the possibility that ho might
not be permitted to come to Oslo
in December to accept the award
in person from King Olaf V.
“He is not allowed to travel
anywhere or take part in public
meetings,’’ the committee said in
a brief biographical note on Luth
uli.

“It’s wonderful,” Mrs. Luthuli
said when informed of the news.
“I know the money will be used
to help people in need, and not for
personal use.”
