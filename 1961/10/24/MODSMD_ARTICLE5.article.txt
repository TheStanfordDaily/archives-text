# Super Nuclear Bomb Exploded in Siberia

### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Russia
yesterday exploded a giant nucle
ar device of 30 to 50 megatons that
unleashed the greatest explosive
force ever produced by man.
The U.S. Atomic Energy Com
mission announced two Soviet
tests in Russia’s Arctic range.
The AEC said the first fallout
producing device had a “very
large yield, possibly as large as
50 megatons,” but more probably
“on the order of 30 megatons.”

THE SECOND was detonated
under water south of the island
under the Novaya Semlya range.
It was in the low yield range, the
AEC said.

The largest previously an
nounced nuclear explosion was a
15-megaton blast set off by the
United States on March 1, 1954.

If the Soviets exploded a 50-
megaton bomb, a device with the
destructive force of 50 million
tons of TNT, the weapon was
2,500 times stronger than the U.S.
atomic bomb that destroyed Hiro
shima in World War 11.

IT COULD produce one third as
much radioactivity as all the nu
clear weapons ever exploded by
all the atomic powers since the
birth of the nuclear ago on July
16. 1945.

The Atomic Energy Commis
sion, after studying its detection
data for nearly 12 hours, was un
able to pin down exactly the
strength of the latest Soviet ex
plosions—the 22nd and 23rd since
Russia resumed tests Sept. 1.

The Soviet blasts came as the
United Nations political commit
tee was considering a “solemn
appeal” to Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev not to fire his big
bomb. The appeal resolution was
offered by five nations in the path
of fallout from the explosion.

IT ALSO followed by one day a
denunciation of the Soviet super
bomb by Secretary of State Dean
Rusk. He called the Soviet bomb
“senseless,” and technically un
necessary. Other U.S. officials
have branded it a “terror weap
on.”

First report of the big Soviet
blast came from Sweden’s Upp
sala University seismological in
stitution. It set the time of the ex
plosion at 4:35 a.m, EDT, and
said it probably was the 50-mega
ton weapon.
Shortly afterward, the French
atomic energy agency said it also
had detected a “very, very pow
erful” explosion which “probably
was of the 50-megaton size.”
Other foreign detection stations
issued similar reports.

THE ATOMIC ENERGY Com
mission and White House sources
reacted cautiously pending a full

study of their data. At first the
word from Newport, R.1., where
President Kennedy was winding
up the weekend, was to the effect
that U.S. experts were “highly
skeptical.”
About mid-day a spokesman for
the AEC said indications were
that the bomb was not in the 50
megaton range. But then, shortly
after 4 p.m. EDT. the commission
issued its official announcement
of a 30-50 megaton blast.
While the two Soviet tests were
the 22nd and 23rd explosions pub
licly announced by the U.S. atom
ic agency, the White House has
said Russia set off others which
were not reported in this country

because to do so might have bared
U.S. detection secrets.
KHRUSHCHEV HAD SAID that
he intended to wind up the tests
with a 50-megaton blast and that
it would come about the end of
this month. If yesterday’s blast
was in the 30-megaton range, it
could mean that a still larger ex
plosion could come in the next few
days.

While at Newport, the President
received intelligence reports on
the Soviet explosions. He had ar
rived back in Washington and was
at Walter Reed Medical Center
visiting Anthony J. Drexel Biddle,
ill from cancer, when the AEC is
sued its announcement.
