# Rally Com Takes Gas, Computer Handles Job
##

BY CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON
Computer programmed and
printed instructions for card
stunts will he introduced by Rally
Com in the coming clash with
U.C.L.A.
This economic innovation is the
result of 9 months hard labor by
senior math majors Earl Boehart
and Larry Breed.
AT THE suggestion of Dr.
George Forsythe of the Computa
tion Center, and with the support
of Rally Com, these two recently
perfected a computer program, in
conjunction with a computer lab
course begun last January, which
automatically prints 3400 instruc
tion cards given only an outline of
the card stunts and their se
quence.
Formerly, Rally Com had to
spend about 400 man hours stamp
ing instruction cards for home
game stunts. With Computation
Center’s Burrough’s 220 and with
the aid of BALGOL, the machine’s
“language,” Breed and Boehart
have reduced this laborious task
to three hours computer time.
WITH such a time saving, Rally
Com is considering card stunts at
certain away games, specifically
Southern Cal. Stunts in connec
tion with yells, like B-A-R-F, dur
ing the game are also being con
sidered.
The new instruction cards will
bo easier for card holders to un
derstand. Instead of beginning
each stunt with the number 1, the
entire afternoon’s program will
follow in sequence from 1 through
100 or more. On the sample card
pictured, each “up on” designates
a different stunt. The card holder
merely flips the colors following
the appropriate numbers and is
not in danger of confusing stunts.

COMPUTER-TYPED CARDS will
now be used in card stunts when
Rally Com is replaced by a com
puting machine.

AT THE suggestion of Dr.
George Forsythe of the Computa
tion Center, and with the support
of Rally Com, these two recently
perfected a computer program, in
conjunction with a computer lab
course begun last January, which
automatically prints 3400 instruc
tion cards given only an outline of
the card stunts and their se
quence.
Formerly, Rally Com had to
spend about 400 man hours stamp
ing instruction cards for home
game stunts. With Computation
Center’s Burrough’s 220 and with
the aid of BALGOL, the machine’s
“language,” Breed and Boehart
have reduced this laborious task
to three hours computer time.
WITH such a time saving, Rally
Com is considering card stunts at
certain away games, specifically
Southern Cal. Stunts in connec
tion with yells, like B-A-R-F, dur
ing the game are also being con
sidered.
The new instruction cards will
bo easier for card holders to un
derstand. Instead of beginning
each stunt with the number 1, the
entire afternoon’s program will
follow in sequence from 1 through
100 or more. On the sample card
pictured, each “up on” designates
a different stunt. The card holder
merely flips the colors following
the appropriate numbers and is
not in danger of confusing stunts.

COMPUTER-TYPED CARDS will
now be used in card stunts when
Rally Com is replaced by a com
puting machine.
