# Farm Firemen to Practice on Doll

A new mannequin which will
simulate responses to closed-chest
heart massage and mouth-to
mouth resuscitation like that of a
real person has been received by
the Stanford Fire Department for
use in teaching these life-saving
techniques.
The “Rosusci-anne,” developed
by a Norwegian doctor two years
ago and manufactured only in
Norway, became available for dis
tribution in the United States only
two or three weeks ago, and Stan
ford is among the first to obtain
one.
THE FIVE-FOOT blonde doll
will be a vital instrument in the
program to teach heart-lung re
suscitation techniques to all Uni
versity employees, started after
the brilliant scientist Dr. Phillip
B. Gallagher was accidentally elec
trocuted in University labs last
spring.
The first device built which will
actually react authentically, the
mannequin is “beautifully design
ed and foolproof,” according to
Hal Wilson. Stanford director of
public health and safety. “If you
do the job incorrectly it just
doesn’t work,” he said.
The inflated plastic model is de
signed so that the chest will rise
if air is being blown into the lungs
properly in mouth-to-mouth resus
citation. As on a human, if the
doll’s head is not tilted back to pre

vent obstruction of the air pas
sage, the chest will not rise.
THE MANNEQUIN is also used
to demonstrate closed-chest heart
massage, which could not be prac
ticed on a live subject without
pain and injury.
This recently developed tech
nique for reviving a per-son whose
heart has stopped requires push
ing down on the flexible breast
bone which lies over the heart 60
to 80 times a minute with a pres
sure of about 80 pounds until the
heart pumps on its own,
A heavy spring on the manne
quin’s chest with an air bladder
under it simulates chest condi
tions, and the amount of pressure
being put on it can be measured
by attaching a pressure gauge.
PURCHASED by the University
Public Health and Safety Depart
ment at a cost of $175, the manne
quin has been turned over to Fire
Department Capt. Harry Lund,
who is giving classes to University
employees.
About 400, including the staffs
of Stanford Electronics Labora
tories and Project M. have already
received training in the heart
lung resuscitation techniques to
be used in any accidents when
breathing or heartbeat is stopped.
An hour-long demonstration of
these methods wijl be given to any
interested campus group; ar
rangements may be made by call
ing Capt. Lund.
