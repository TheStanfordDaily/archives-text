The American people are run
ning further and further away
from the spirit of their own revo
lution, claimed Leonard E. Read,
president of the Foundation for
Economic Education, Inc., in a
talk to Business School students
and faculty last night.
Read believes that the American
public, in ignorance, has allowed
the government to control not
only the destructive forces of men
in the country, but also the pro
ductive and creative realms.
Along with the overextension of
the -state, we have lost our great
faith in the capabilities of (he free
man. Our revolutionary belief in
man as “endowed by the Creator
with certain inalienable rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness” has drifted to the con
trary belief that the state is the
endower of men’s rights.
Creeping U.S. inflation could be
gin to gallop unless a reverse in
thought is led soon by leaders who
excel in the undertainding and ex
position of the spirit of free econ
omy.
