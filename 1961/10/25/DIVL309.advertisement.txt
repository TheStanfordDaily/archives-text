What about standards?
Advanced students of girl watching never waste eyeball
effort watching girls who are not beautiful. Standards
must be kept high.
But how do we judge whether a girl is worth watch
ing? Although many strict academicians will shudder at
our aesthetics, we must insist that a girl is beautiful if
she is beautiful to you. (That’s the beauty of girl watch
ing. Every girl is beautiful to someone!) For example,
many observers have pointed out that the Bare-Backed
Beachbomb (sec above) has a weak chin.
Yet none of these keen-eyed experts would deny that
she is indeed an attractive specimen. And, speaking of
standards, don’t forget to keep your smoking standards
high. Smoke Pall Mall!
