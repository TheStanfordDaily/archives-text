### CHRIS WILLS 
“The character of a nation is
composed of both men and wom
en. Although their opinions may
be similar, they can never be en
tirely the same.”
In these words Dr. David M.
Potter, Coe professor of history
at Stanford, discussed the char
acter of the American woman and
her influence on American soci
ety. Ho spoke last night at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
AN OLD riddle states how two
Indians are sitting on a fence,
Potter began. The little Indian is
the big Indian's son, but the big
Indian isn’t the little Indian’s
father. What is their relationship?
Becaase the American social
structure is expressed in mascu
line terms, one fails to guess that
the big Indian is a mother.
Historical events are seen
through male experience. The wil
derness mastered the colonists.
They heard the call of the wild
almost as clearly as did Jack Lon
don's dog. However, the West of
fered opportunities for men, not
women.
According to Potter, female in
dependence began when the wil
derness ended. Work in the city
called for women’s ready adapta
bility. The typewriter played a
vital part in her independence.
DESPITE strong tendencies to
conform, the American woman
now exercises a greater individual
ism. The housewife is an econ
omist, interior decorator, child
psychologist, and transportation
manager.
She also exercises an important
economic function, that of the
consumer. The wife changes her
husband’s wage into a family life.
However, with the role of con
sumer comes lack of respect. Pot
ter believes that she’s flattered,
bullied and not treated as a ma
ture person.
HER ESSENTIAL strength has
been increased, but the pecuniary
system threatens her with new
subordination.
The job of the American woman
is to held her needs as a person
and as a woman in balance.
