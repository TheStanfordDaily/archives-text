## Frosh Full Moon Raid Called Act of Stupidity 
### BILL GRIFFIN 
Monday night it was my mis
fortune to witness one of the most,
appalling acts of pure crudeness
and stupidity that I have encoun
tered since coming to Stanford.
Those seniors who attend the
traditional ceremony in Inner
Quad were not surprised to see
some freshmen there with water
balloons; most were considerably
surprised when the crowd of
freshmen swelled to a rowdy mob
(estimated at between 125 and
250) armed not merely with bal
loons but with buckets, hoses and
wastebaskets.
The group of “spirited” fresh
men soon became a crowd of
screaming, obscene animals. Not
content to surround Senior Circle
and drench the participants and
shout obscenities, they tried to
snatch girls from their dates as
the soaked seniors tried to leave;
at the same time idiots in an elec
tric cart and on bicycles tried to
run down those who moved out of
the circle, in order to drench them
further.
I RETURNED TO Inner Quad
after taking my date home to see
if the assininity was still proceed
ing. As I walked onto Quad the
freshmen were milling around the
English building, where they ap
parently had some seniors trap
ped.
As I stood watching I was hailed
by a young German couple who,
attracted by the noise, had wan
dered onto Quad. They asked me
what this was all about; I told
them. Just as I was completing
my explanation that this was
merely a demonstration of the
vaunted freshman spirit, the
young lady was spotted by one of
the freshmen, who quickly relayed
the message to his friends.
Within seconds the three of us
were surrounded by a mob of
freshmen, pawing and snatching
at the girl. The girl, surrounded
by a pack of animals screaming
“Rape her! Rape her!” and other
unprintable slogans, panicked and
ran.
SHE WAS CHASED into one of
the garden circles on Quad, and
again surrounded. She there be
came trapped in the thick bushes,
while the freshmen shined flash
lights on her and continued their
screaming.
Several of these brave defenders
of their class’ honor fought their
way through the bushes, grabbed

the girl from behind, and dragged
her out into the open, where she
was thrown down, then picked up
and held so more freshmen could
throw their water on her.

By the time her date and myself
had gotten to the center of he mob
and the girl was freed she had
lost both her shoes, had skinned
both knees, torn her clothing, and
was extremely frightened.
AND ALL THE while the mob
of “mature, intelligent, well
rounded individuals” stood around
screaming for “Rape!” and “Hold
her up! Do it again!” The girl and
her date ran. The mob soon found
another girl near Memorial Arch,
and began baiting her. In the
meantime the first girl’s escort
and I borrowed a policeman’s
flashlight and found her shoes.
First, I suggest that the fresh
man class owes a general apology
to this girl and her escort; they
are going to carry a fine opinion
of this University from now on.
Second, I would like to point out
that there is a place for spirit and
a place for sheer animal crudity
such as that displayed Monday
night. I have myself been attend
ing full moons for three years,
and Monday was the first night I
had seen anything like this. In the
past, there have occasionally been
10 or 20 freshmen bearing watery
gifts for the seniors.
THE SENIORS would wear
coats and the freshmen would
stand in the bushes laughing and
throwing balloons, and the whole
thing had an aura of good clean
fun. The freshmen did not sur
round the Senior Circle with the
sole intent of drowning as many
seniors as possible, nor try to
snatch girls aways from their es
corts, nor run down people in elec
tric carts and on bicycles.
What happened Monday night
was merely mob behavior, and
not one of the participants showed
the slightest exercise of leader
ship or intelligence or the maturi
ty to know when things were get
ting out of hand.

Possibly the worst thing about
this entire incident is that those
of the mob to whom I talked after
ward showed absolutely no sign
of remorse or any feeling that
what they had been doing was not
above reproach.
And One sponsor present within
the circle noted that “my whole
house” was there in the mob; but
he did not look too happy when he
saw what “spirit” can do.
However, he made no move to
stop any of the proceedings, when
he was the only person on Quad
who could have commanded the
respect necessary to at least slow
down the proceedings. After all,
we don’t want to dampen House
Spirit or make the sponsors look
like straight arrows.
It is my fervent hope that some
where in the freshman class there
are at least a few individuals who
are capable of exerting some form
of leadership, to urge that nothing
like this happens again.
IF IT continues, the inevitable
result will be either the cessation
of the full moon tradition or a
growing bitterness and the de
ployment of goon squads by both
sides, until full moon night be
comes the scene of a monthly
“rumble” and someone is more
seriously injured than the poor
German girl of Monday night.
In the meantime, I suggest that
the administration take some
form of action to assure that
nothing like this disgrace happens
again. Perhaps an 11 p.m. curfew
on freshmen men might be in
order?

ward showed absolutely no sign
of remorse or any feeling that
what they had been doing was not
above reproach.
And One sponsor present within
the circle noted that “my whole
house” was there in the mob; but
he did not look too happy when he
saw what “spirit” can do.
However, he made no move to
stop any of the proceedings, when
he was the only person on Quad
who could have commanded the
respect necessary to at least slow
down the proceedings. After all,
we don’t want to dampen House
Spirit or make the sponsors look
like straight arrows.
It is my fervent hope that some
where in the freshman class there
are at least a few individuals who
are capable of exerting some form
of leadership, to urge that nothing
like this happens again.
IF IT continues, the inevitable
result will be either the cessation
of the full moon tradition or a
growing bitterness and the de
ployment of goon squads by both
sides, until full moon night be
comes the scene of a monthly
“rumble” and someone is more
seriously injured than the poor
German girl of Monday night.
In the meantime, I suggest that
the administration take some
form of action to assure that
nothing like this disgrace happens
again. Perhaps an 11 p.m. curfew
on freshmen men might be in
order?
Monday night it was my mis
fortune to witness one of the most,
appalling acts of pure crudeness
and stupidity that I have encoun
tered since coming to Stanford.
Those seniors who attend the
traditional ceremony in Inner
Quad were not surprised to see
some freshmen there with water
balloons; most were considerably
surprised when the crowd of
freshmen swelled to a rowdy mob
(estimated at between 125 and
250) armed not merely with bal
loons but with buckets, hoses and
wastebaskets.
The group of “spirited” fresh
men soon became a crowd of
screaming, obscene animals. Not
content to surround Senior Circle
and drench the participants and
shout obscenities, they tried to
snatch girls from their dates as
the soaked seniors tried to leave;
at the same time idiots in an elec
tric cart and on bicycles tried to
run down those who moved out of
the circle, in order to drench them
further.
I RETURNED TO Inner Quad
after taking my date home to see
if the assininity was still proceed
ing. As I walked onto Quad the
freshmen were milling around the
English building, where they ap
parently had some seniors trap
ped.
As I stood watching I was hailed
by a young German couple who,
attracted by the noise, had wan
dered onto Quad. They asked me
what this was all about; I told
them. Just as I was completing
my explanation that this was
merely a demonstration of the
vaunted freshman spirit, the
young lady was spotted by one of
the freshmen, who quickly relayed
the message to his friends.
Within seconds the three of us
were surrounded by a mob of
freshmen, pawing and snatching
at the girl. The girl, surrounded
by a pack of animals screaming
“Rape her! Rape her!” and other
unprintable slogans, panicked and
ran.
SHE WAS CHASED into one of
the garden circles on Quad, and
again surrounded. She there be
came trapped in the thick bushes,
while the freshmen shined flash
lights on her and continued their
screaming.
Several of these brave defenders
of their class’ honor fought their
way through the bushes, grabbed

the girl from behind, and dragged
her out into the open, where she
was thrown down, then picked up
and held so more freshmen could
throw their water on her.

By the time her date and myself
had gotten to the center of he mob
and the girl was freed she had
lost both her shoes, had skinned
both knees, torn her clothing, and
was extremely frightened.
AND ALL THE while the mob
of “mature, intelligent, well
rounded individuals” stood around
screaming for “Rape!” and “Hold
her up! Do it again!” The girl and
her date ran. The mob soon found
another girl near Memorial Arch,
and began baiting her. In the
meantime the first girl’s escort
and I borrowed a policeman’s
flashlight and found her shoes.
First, I suggest that the fresh
man class owes a general apology
to this girl and her escort; they
are going to carry a fine opinion
of this University from now on.
Second, I would like to point out
that there is a place for spirit and
a place for sheer animal crudity
such as that displayed Monday
night. I have myself been attend
ing full moons for three years,
and Monday was the first night I
had seen anything like this. In the
past, there have occasionally been
10 or 20 freshmen bearing watery
gifts for the seniors.
THE SENIORS would wear
coats and the freshmen would
stand in the bushes laughing and
throwing balloons, and the whole
thing had an aura of good clean
fun. The freshmen did not sur
round the Senior Circle with the
sole intent of drowning as many
seniors as possible, nor try to
snatch girls aways from their es
corts, nor run down people in elec
tric carts and on bicycles.
What happened Monday night
was merely mob behavior, and
not one of the participants showed
the slightest exercise of leader
ship or intelligence or the maturi
ty to know when things were get
ting out of hand.

Possibly the worst thing about
this entire incident is that those
of the mob to whom I talked after

flashlight and found her shoes.
First, I suggest that the fresh
man class owes a general apology
to this girl and her escort; they
are going to carry a fine opinion
of this University from now on.
Second, I would like to point out
that there is a place for spirit and
a place for sheer animal crudity
such as that displayed Monday
night. I have myself been attend
ing full moons for three years,
and Monday was the first night I
had seen anything like this. In the
past, there have occasionally been
10 or 20 freshmen bearing watery
gifts for the seniors.
THE SENIORS would wear
coats and the freshmen would
stand in the bushes laughing and
throwing balloons, and the whole
thing had an aura of good clean
fun. The freshmen did not sur
round the Senior Circle with the
sole intent of drowning as many
seniors as possible, nor try to
snatch girls aways from their es
corts, nor run down people in elec
tric carts and on bicycles.
What happened Monday night
was merely mob behavior, and
not one of the participants showed
the slightest exercise of leader
ship or intelligence or the maturi
ty to know when things were get
ting out of hand.

Possibly the worst thing about
this entire incident is that those
of the mob to whom I talked after
ward showed absolutely no sign
of remorse or any feeling that
what they had been doing was not
above reproach.
And One sponsor present within
the circle noted that “my whole
house” was there in the mob; but
he did not look too happy when he
saw what “spirit” can do.
However, he made no move to
stop any of the proceedings, when
he was the only person on Quad
who could have commanded the
respect necessary to at least slow
down the proceedings. After all,
we don’t want to dampen House
Spirit or make the sponsors look
like straight arrows.
It is my fervent hope that some
where in the freshman class there
are at least a few individuals who
are capable of exerting some form
of leadership, to urge that nothing
like this happens again.
IF IT continues, the inevitable
result will be either the cessation
of the full moon tradition or a
growing bitterness and the de
ployment of goon squads by both
sides, until full moon night be
comes the scene of a monthly
“rumble” and someone is more
seriously injured than the poor
German girl of Monday night.
In the meantime, I suggest that
the administration take some
form of action to assure that
nothing like this disgrace happens
again. Perhaps an 11 p.m. curfew
on freshmen men might be in
order?
Monday night it was my mis
fortune to witness one of the most,
appalling acts of pure crudeness
and stupidity that I have encoun
tered since coming to Stanford.
Those seniors who attend the
traditional ceremony in Inner
Quad were not surprised to see
some freshmen there with water
balloons; most were considerably
surprised when the crowd of
freshmen swelled to a rowdy mob
(estimated at between 125 and
250) armed not merely with bal
loons but with buckets, hoses and
wastebaskets.
The group of “spirited” fresh
men soon became a crowd of
screaming, obscene animals. Not
content to surround Senior Circle
and drench the participants and
shout obscenities, they tried to
snatch girls from their dates as
the soaked seniors tried to leave;
at the same time idiots in an elec
tric cart and on bicycles tried to
run down those who moved out of
the circle, in order to drench them
further.
I RETURNED TO Inner Quad
after taking my date home to see
if the assininity was still proceed
ing. As I walked onto Quad the
freshmen were milling around the
English building, where they ap
parently had some seniors trap
ped.
As I stood watching I was hailed
by a young German couple who,
attracted by the noise, had wan
dered onto Quad. They asked me
what this was all about; I told
them. Just as I was completing
my explanation that this was
merely a demonstration of the
vaunted freshman spirit, the
young lady was spotted by one of
the freshmen, who quickly relayed
the message to his friends.
Within seconds the three of us
were surrounded by a mob of
freshmen, pawing and snatching
at the girl. The girl, surrounded
by a pack of animals screaming
“Rape her! Rape her!” and other
unprintable slogans, panicked and
ran.
SHE WAS CHASED into one of
the garden circles on Quad, and
again surrounded. She there be
came trapped in the thick bushes,
while the freshmen shined flash
lights on her and continued their
screaming.
Several of these brave defenders
of their class’ honor fought their
way through the bushes, grabbed

the girl from behind, and dragged
her out into the open, where she
was thrown down, then picked up
and held so more freshmen could
throw their water on her.

By the time her date and myself
had gotten to the center of he mob
and the girl was freed she had
lost both her shoes, had skinned
both knees, torn her clothing, and
was extremely frightened.
AND ALL THE while the mob
of “mature, intelligent, well
rounded individuals” stood around
screaming for “Rape!” and “Hold
her up! Do it again!” The girl and
her date ran. The mob soon found
another girl near Memorial Arch,
and began baiting her. In the
meantime the first girl’s escort
and I borrowed a policeman’s
flashlight and found her shoes.

man class owes a general apology
to this girl and her escort; they
