MOSCOW (UPD—The abrupt
departure of Chinese Communist
Premier Chou En-lai from the
22nd Communist Party Congress
gave sharp emphasis yesterday to
the Sovict-Chinese differences
over Albania.
There was speculation his de
parture for Peiping indicated a
serious rift but observers in Mos
cow were convinced no major
rupture between the two Commu
nist giant was foreseeable.
The main clues to the current
state of Soviet-Chinese relations
are likely to come from the news
papers of the two countries dur
ing the next few days.
Observers also will be watching
Moscow to attend the meeting of
to see whether Chou returns to
80 Communist parties here before
the Nov. 7 celebrations of the
Russian revolution.
Chou left Monday without ad
vance notice and was received in
Peiping by Communist Leader
Mao Tze-tung, chairman Liu
Shao-chi and other Communist
leaders. The Now China news
agency said he received a "warm
welcome.”
The Soviet Tass news agency
said Chou radioed Premier Nikita
S. Khrushchev from his plane,
thanking him for his warm recep
tion.
