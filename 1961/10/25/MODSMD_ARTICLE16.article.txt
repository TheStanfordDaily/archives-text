PACIFISM
Editor, The Daily;
Without sounding like a jingo
ist, I would like to take issue with
Mr. Hunn’s pacifist stand and his
theory of the “bettor world for
all.”
I agree with Mr. Hunn that we
Americans must strive for a bet
ter world. But, I think his argu
ment stands on weak grounds in
that he attempts to interpret Com
munist ideology, and in that he
forecasts the world to come, after
the Communists have taken over.
Either Mr. Hunn does not read
the newspapers, or he is too naive
to know what they say. Mr.
Khrushchev has promised us that
our “grandchildren will live under
Communism,” and he intends to
make true his promise if he lives
that long.
Khrushchev loves to make
threats. The past 115 years has
seen Communism capture one
third of the people of the world,
in the greatest and most success
ful imperialist venture ever em
barked on by mankind. At this
rate, the Red Star would fly over
all the countries of the world
within 30 years.
In the face of this threat, the
United States can not disarm.
If as Mr. Hunn says, “democ
racy and the ideals of individual
liberty would eventually triumph
throughout the world” then why
should we not fight for these
ideals ?
Why should we lay down our
arms and invite the Russians to
take over just because wo know
our ideals will win out in the end
anyway?
His point of view is paradoxical.
Either it is that of a lazy man
who would rather talk than do, or
that of an extremely naive person
who underestimates Communism.
I submit to you that the war is on
and that we cannot afford to leave
our battle posts.

(EDITOR’S NOTE: We feel this
controversy has gotten to the
point where nothing new or con
structive is being added. There

ject will be printed unless they
have something new to say —and
say it in 300 words or less.)
ANTI-COMMUNISM
Editor, The Daily:
A recent letter to The Daily
written by David G. Millar con
cerning the inappropriateness of
criticism against American anti
communist feeling, raises ques
tions that I find disturbing.
He points to Mr. Davis and says,
“either you’re for or against us—
and you’d better say where you
stand.” The unstated implication
being that unless you’re a 100 per
cent anti-Communist you’re pink.
Mr. Millar, like the late Joseph
McCarthy, is pointing the finger
of fear.

This fear has made it impossible
for many people to consider the
Communist threat in a rational
manner. Certainly the position of
the extreme right is an unrealistic
one when they insist that any
form of bargaining with the Rus
sians is a betrayal of the U.S.
But more important, in my eyes,
is the effect on civil liberties and
democracy of the type of black
and white thinking illustrated so
well by Mr. Millar. Certainly it
must be clear that if what we de
test most about Communism is
the lack of personal and ideologi
cal freedom inherent in that sys
tem, then it is all the more im
portant to make doubly sure that
these values are preserved here.
Yet, freedom of thought and
opinion is distinctly suspect in the
eyes of the right, particularly if
you have ideas which don't agree
with theirs. Examples of this be
havior are so profuse both in our
schools and out, that no illustra
tion is required.
Certainly this country would be
in a far stronger psychological

position if the fervent energies
of the radical anti-Communist
right could be directed toward
constructive ends which would re
lieve their sense of frustration
over the Communist threat, and
at the same time do some good.
Perhaps it is one of the failures
of the present administration that
it hasn’t been articulate in voicing
alternate paths of personal action.
I can only hope that reason will
come to be a recognized American
virtue of the extreme right.

INACCURATE REPORTING
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned members
of the Stanford soccer team wish
to express our concern over the
inaccurate reporting of the Stan
ford-Cal Aggie game.
As there was no Daily reporter
at the game, we realize that the
inaccuracies were perhaps a re
sult of misinformation received
from some other source, in which
case there would still be no excuse
for presenting such an inaccurate
picture.
We will now list the inaccu
racies as they appeared in The
Daily:
1. ‘ ... the hooters were shot
down ... in a game they had in
the bag till the closing minutes
...” The game was never in the
bag. In fact, Stanford fought from
behind (2-0) to tie the game in the
early minutes of the second half.
Most of the second half was domi
nated by the Aggies.
2. The story relates that the Ag
gie rally occurred in the last eight
minutes. It is the concensus of
opinion that their rally occurred
well before this, as the starting
goalie was put back in the game
and played at least five minutes,
during which time the Aggies did
not score.

3. “The Aggies were lacking
considerably in fundamentals ... ”
The Aggies team is good we
barely beat them last fall and they

beat us in an exhibition game last
spring.

4. “Two goals came as a result
of Aggie offsides that weren’t
spotted by the officials.” This is a
poor statement for anyone to
make, especially since one of our
goals was scored off the elbow of
a Stanford player, highly illegal
and also not spotted by the offi
cials.

5. Admittedly, Stanford’s goal
tending was not up to par. How
ever, to say that “Stanford’s two
best goalies were sidelined with
injuries” is as false a statement
as has been seen in this paper.
One of the two has dropped from
the team because of a heavy
schedule, and the other was other
wise committed.

6. Stanford’s first goal was
scored by co-captain Mike Tippett,
not Mike Ero, and did not tie the
score at 1-1, as reported, but made
it 2-1.

We feel that the evidence speaks
for itself, and in the future, we
hope that stories about any Stan
ford team are accurate. We would
rathe! - see no story than one such
as appeared in Monday’s Daily, as
such a story is unfair to the Stan
ford team, the opponent, and to
the Stanford student body.

must be clear that if what we de
test most about Communism is
the lack of personal and ideologi

these values are preserved here.
Yet, freedom of thought and
opinion is distinctly suspect in the
eyes of the right, particularly if
you have ideas which don't agree
with theirs. Examples of this be

schools and out, that no illustra

Certainly this country would be
in a far stronger psychological

position if the fervent energies
of the radical anti-Communist
right could be directed toward
constructive ends which would re
lieve their sense of frustration
over the Communist threat, and
at the same time do some good.
Perhaps it is one of the failures
of the present administration that
it hasn’t been articulate in voicing
alternate paths of personal action.
I can only hope that reason will
come to be a recognized American
virtue of the extreme right.

INACCURATE REPORTING
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned members
of the Stanford soccer team wish
to express our concern over the
inaccurate reporting of the Stan
ford-Cal Aggie game.
As there was no Daily reporter
at the game, we realize that the
inaccuracies were perhaps a re
sult of misinformation received
from some other source, in which
case there would still be no excuse
for presenting such an inaccurate
picture.
We will now list the inaccu
racies as they appeared in The
Daily:
1. ‘ ... the hooters were shot
down ... in a game they had in
the bag till the closing minutes
...” The game was never in the
bag. In fact, Stanford fought from
behind (2-0) to tie the game in the
early minutes of the second half.
Most of the second half was domi
nated by the Aggies.
2. The story relates that the Ag
gie rally occurred in the last eight
minutes. It is the concensus of
opinion that their rally occurred
well before this, as the starting
goalie was put back in the game
and played at least five minutes,
during which time the Aggies did
not score.

3. “The Aggies were lacking
considerably in fundamentals ... ”
The Aggies team is good we
barely beat them last fall and they

beat us in an exhibition game last
spring.

4. “Two goals came as a result
of Aggie offsides that weren’t
spotted by the officials.” This is a
poor statement for anyone to
make, especially since one of our
goals was scored off the elbow of
a Stanford player, highly illegal
and also not spotted by the offi
cials.

5. Admittedly, Stanford’s goal
tending was not up to par. How
ever, to say that “Stanford’s two
best goalies were sidelined with
injuries” is as false a statement
as has been seen in this paper.
One of the two has dropped from
the team because of a heavy
schedule, and the other was other
wise committed.

6. Stanford’s first goal was
scored by co-captain Mike Tippett,
not Mike Ero, and did not tie the
score at 1-1, as reported, but made
it 2-1.

We feel that the evidence speaks
for itself, and in the future, we
hope that stories about any Stan
ford team are accurate. We would
rathe! - see no story than one such
as appeared in Monday’s Daily, as
such a story is unfair to the Stan
ford team, the opponent, and to
the Stanford student body.

PACIFISM
Editor, The Daily;
Without sounding like a jingo
ist, I would like to take issue with
Mr. Hunn’s pacifist stand and his
theory of the “bettor world for
all.”
I agree with Mr. Hunn that we
Americans must strive for a bet
ter world. But, I think his argu
ment stands on weak grounds in
that he attempts to interpret Com
munist ideology, and in that he
forecasts the world to come, after
the Communists have taken over.
Either Mr. Hunn does not read
the newspapers, or he is too naive
to know what they say. Mr.
Khrushchev has promised us that
our “grandchildren will live under
Communism,” and he intends to
make true his promise if he lives
that long.
Khrushchev loves to make
threats. The past 115 years has
seen Communism capture one
third of the people of the world,
in the greatest and most success
ful imperialist venture ever em
barked on by mankind. At this
rate, the Red Star would fly over
all the countries of the world
within 30 years.
In the face of this threat, the
United States can not disarm.
If as Mr. Hunn says, “democ
racy and the ideals of individual
liberty would eventually triumph
throughout the world” then why
should we not fight for these
ideals ?
Why should we lay down our
arms and invite the Russians to
take over just because wo know
our ideals will win out in the end
anyway?
His point of view is paradoxical.
Either it is that of a lazy man
who would rather talk than do, or
that of an extremely naive person
who underestimates Communism.
I submit to you that the war is on
and that we cannot afford to leave
our battle posts.

ANTI-COMMUNISM
Editor, The Daily:
A recent letter to The Daily
written by David G. Millar con
cerning the inappropriateness of
criticism against American anti
communist feeling, raises ques
tions that I find disturbing.
He points to Mr. Davis and says,
“either you’re for or against us—
and you’d better say where you
stand.” The unstated implication
being that unless you’re a 100 per
cent anti-Communist you’re pink.
Mr. Millar, like the late Joseph
McCarthy, is pointing the finger
of fear.

This fear has made it impossible
for many people to consider the
Communist threat in a rational
manner. Certainly the position of
the extreme right is an unrealistic
one when they insist that any
form of bargaining with the Rus
sians is a betrayal of the U.S.
But more important, in my eyes,
is the effect on civil liberties and
democracy of the type of black
and white thinking illustrated so

5. Admittedly, Stanford’s goal
tending was not up to par. How
ever, to say that “Stanford’s two
best goalies were sidelined with
injuries” is as false a statement
as has been seen in this paper.
One of the two has dropped from
the team because of a heavy
schedule, and the other was other
wise committed.

6. Stanford’s first goal was
scored by co-captain Mike Tippett,
not Mike Ero, and did not tie the
score at 1-1, as reported, but made
it 2-1.

We feel that the evidence speaks
for itself, and in the future, we
hope that stories about any Stan
ford team are accurate. We would
rathe! - see no story than one such
as appeared in Monday’s Daily, as
such a story is unfair to the Stan
ford team, the opponent, and to
the Stanford student body.

PACIFISM
Editor, The Daily;
Without sounding like a jingo
ist, I would like to take issue with
Mr. Hunn’s pacifist stand and his
theory of the “bettor world for
all.”
I agree with Mr. Hunn that we
Americans must strive for a bet
ter world. But, I think his argu
ment stands on weak grounds in
that he attempts to interpret Com
munist ideology, and in that he
forecasts the world to come, after
the Communists have taken over.
Either Mr. Hunn does not read
the newspapers, or he is too naive
to know what they say. Mr.
Khrushchev has promised us that
our “grandchildren will live under
Communism,” and he intends to
make true his promise if he lives
that long.
Khrushchev loves to make
threats. The past 115 years has
seen Communism capture one
third of the people of the world,
in the greatest and most success
ful imperialist venture ever em
barked on by mankind. At this
rate, the Red Star would fly over
all the countries of the world
within 30 years.
In the face of this threat, the
United States can not disarm.
If as Mr. Hunn says, “democ
racy and the ideals of individual
liberty would eventually triumph
throughout the world” then why
should we not fight for these
ideals ?
Why should we lay down our
arms and invite the Russians to
take over just because wo know
our ideals will win out in the end
anyway?
His point of view is paradoxical.
Either it is that of a lazy man
who would rather talk than do, or
that of an extremely naive person
who underestimates Communism.
I submit to you that the war is on
and that we cannot afford to leave
our battle posts.

ANTI-COMMUNISM
Editor, The Daily:
A recent letter to The Daily
written by David G. Millar con
cerning the inappropriateness of
criticism against American anti
communist feeling, raises ques
tions that I find disturbing.
He points to Mr. Davis and says,
“either you’re for or against us—
and you’d better say where you
stand.” The unstated implication
being that unless you’re a 100 per
cent anti-Communist you’re pink.
Mr. Millar, like the late Joseph
McCarthy, is pointing the finger
of fear.

This fear has made it impossible
for many people to consider the
Communist threat in a rational
manner. Certainly the position of
the extreme right is an unrealistic
one when they insist that any
form of bargaining with the Rus
sians is a betrayal of the U.S.
But more important, in my eyes,
is the effect on civil liberties and
democracy of the type of black
and white thinking illustrated so
well by Mr. Millar. Certainly it
must be clear that if what we de
test most about Communism is
the lack of personal and ideologi
cal freedom inherent in that sys
tem, then it is all the more im
portant to make doubly sure that
these values are preserved here.
Yet, freedom of thought and
opinion is distinctly suspect in the
eyes of the right, particularly if
you have ideas which don't agree
with theirs. Examples of this be
havior are so profuse both in our
schools and out, that no illustra
tion is required.
Certainly this country would be
in a far stronger psychological

position if the fervent energies
of the radical anti-Communist
right could be directed toward
constructive ends which would re
lieve their sense of frustration
over the Communist threat, and
at the same time do some good.
Perhaps it is one of the failures
of the present administration that
it hasn’t been articulate in voicing
alternate paths of personal action.
I can only hope that reason will
come to be a recognized American
virtue of the extreme right.

INACCURATE REPORTING
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned members
of the Stanford soccer team wish
to express our concern over the
inaccurate reporting of the Stan
ford-Cal Aggie game.
As there was no Daily reporter
at the game, we realize that the
inaccuracies were perhaps a re
sult of misinformation received
from some other source, in which
case there would still be no excuse
for presenting such an inaccurate
picture.
We will now list the inaccu
racies as they appeared in The
Daily:
1. ‘ ... the hooters were shot
down ... in a game they had in
the bag till the closing minutes
...” The game was never in the
bag. In fact, Stanford fought from
behind (2-0) to tie the game in the
early minutes of the second half.
Most of the second half was domi
nated by the Aggies.
2. The story relates that the Ag
gie rally occurred in the last eight
minutes. It is the concensus of
opinion that their rally occurred
well before this, as the starting
goalie was put back in the game
and played at least five minutes,
during which time the Aggies did
not score.

3. “The Aggies were lacking
considerably in fundamentals ... ”
The Aggies team is good we
barely beat them last fall and they

beat us in an exhibition game last
spring.

4. “Two goals came as a result
of Aggie offsides that weren’t
spotted by the officials.” This is a
poor statement for anyone to
make, especially since one of our
goals was scored off the elbow of
a Stanford player, highly illegal
and also not spotted by the offi
cials.

5. Admittedly, Stanford’s goal
tending was not up to par. How
ever, to say that “Stanford’s two

ANTI-COMMUNISM
Editor, The Daily:
A recent letter to The Daily
written by David G. Millar con
cerning the inappropriateness of
criticism against American anti
communist feeling, raises ques
tions that I find disturbing.
He points to Mr. Davis and says,
“either you’re for or against us—
and you’d better say where you
stand.” The unstated implication
being that unless you’re a 100 per
cent anti-Communist you’re pink.
Mr. Millar, like the late Joseph
McCarthy, is pointing the finger
of fear.

This fear has made it impossible
for many people to consider the
Communist threat in a rational
manner. Certainly the position of
the extreme right is an unrealistic
one when they insist that any
form of bargaining with the Rus
sians is a betrayal of the U.S.
But more important, in my eyes,
is the effect on civil liberties and
democracy of the type of black
and white thinking illustrated so
well by Mr. Millar. Certainly it
must be clear that if what we de
test most about Communism is
the lack of personal and ideologi
cal freedom inherent in that sys
tem, then it is all the more im
portant to make doubly sure that
these values are preserved here.
Yet, freedom of thought and
opinion is distinctly suspect in the
eyes of the right, particularly if
you have ideas which don't agree
with theirs. Examples of this be
havior are so profuse both in our
schools and out, that no illustra
tion is required.
Certainly this country would be
in a far stronger psychological

position if the fervent energies
of the radical anti-Communist
right could be directed toward
constructive ends which would re
lieve their sense of frustration
over the Communist threat, and
at the same time do some good.
Perhaps it is one of the failures
of the present administration that
it hasn’t been articulate in voicing
alternate paths of personal action.
I can only hope that reason will
come to be a recognized American
virtue of the extreme right.

INACCURATE REPORTING
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned members
of the Stanford soccer team wish
to express our concern over the
inaccurate reporting of the Stan
ford-Cal Aggie game.
As there was no Daily reporter
at the game, we realize that the
inaccuracies were perhaps a re
sult of misinformation received
from some other source, in which
case there would still be no excuse
for presenting such an inaccurate
picture.
We will now list the inaccu
racies as they appeared in The
Daily:
1. ‘ ... the hooters were shot
down ... in a game they had in
the bag till the closing minutes
...” The game was never in the
bag. In fact, Stanford fought from
behind (2-0) to tie the game in the
early minutes of the second half.
Most of the second half was domi
nated by the Aggies.
2. The story relates that the Ag
gie rally occurred in the last eight
minutes. It is the concensus of
opinion that their rally occurred
well before this, as the starting
goalie was put back in the game
and played at least five minutes,
during which time the Aggies did
not score.

3. “The Aggies were lacking
considerably in fundamentals ... ”
The Aggies team is good we
barely beat them last fall and they

beat us in an exhibition game last
spring.

4. “Two goals came as a result
of Aggie offsides that weren’t
spotted by the officials.” This is a
poor statement for anyone to
make, especially since one of our
goals was scored off the elbow of
a Stanford player, highly illegal
and also not spotted by the offi
cials.

5. Admittedly, Stanford’s goal
tending was not up to par. How
ever, to say that “Stanford’s two
best goalies were sidelined with
injuries” is as false a statement
as has been seen in this paper.
One of the two has dropped from
the team because of a heavy
schedule, and the other was other
wise committed.

6. Stanford’s first goal was
scored by co-captain Mike Tippett,
not Mike Ero, and did not tie the
score at 1-1, as reported, but made
it 2-1.

We feel that the evidence speaks
for itself, and in the future, we
hope that stories about any Stan
ford team are accurate. We would
rathe! - see no story than one such
as appeared in Monday’s Daily, as
such a story is unfair to the Stan
ford team, the opponent, and to
the Stanford student body.

PACIFISM
Editor, The Daily;
Without sounding like a jingo
ist, I would like to take issue with
Mr. Hunn’s pacifist stand and his
theory of the “bettor world for
all.”
I agree with Mr. Hunn that we
Americans must strive for a bet
ter world. But, I think his argu
ment stands on weak grounds in
that he attempts to interpret Com
munist ideology, and in that he
forecasts the world to come, after
the Communists have taken over.
Either Mr. Hunn does not read
the newspapers, or he is too naive
to know what they say. Mr.
Khrushchev has promised us that
our “grandchildren will live under
Communism,” and he intends to
make true his promise if he lives
that long.
Khrushchev loves to make
threats. The past 115 years has
seen Communism capture one
third of the people of the world,
in the greatest and most success
ful imperialist venture ever em
barked on by mankind. At this
rate, the Red Star would fly over
all the countries of the world
within 30 years.
In the face of this threat, the
United States can not disarm.
If as Mr. Hunn says, “democ
racy and the ideals of individual
liberty would eventually triumph
throughout the world” then why
should we not fight for these
ideals ?
Why should we lay down our
arms and invite the Russians to
take over just because wo know
our ideals will win out in the end
anyway?
His point of view is paradoxical.
Either it is that of a lazy man
who would rather talk than do, or
that of an extremely naive person
who underestimates Communism.
I submit to you that the war is on
and that we cannot afford to leave
our battle posts.
