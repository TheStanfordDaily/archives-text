# Education Helps, Makes Prejudice More Polite
## 
### 
NEW YORK (UPD—Education
apparently doesn’t reduce religi
ous or racial prejudice— it just
teaches a man to express it more
politely.

That’s the finding of a study of
attitudes toward Jews and Ne
groes in the United States mafic
by Dr. Charles Herbert Stember
of Rutgers University for the
American Jewish Committee. Its
basis is an analysis of public
opinion polls made during the
1940’s and early 1950’5.

UNTIL a generation ago, Stem
ber said, it was “believed that the
teaching of facts about minority
groups could do much to reduce
prejudice ... In recent years it
has no longer seemed so obvious
that classroom learning is an es
calator which automatically lifts
the individual to higher levels of
group undersatnding.”

In fact, .he said, it seems pos
sible that “the educational pro
cess, by scrupulously refraining
from teaching specific doctrines
may in effect bo creating a vacu
um which the prevailing winds of
prejudice might rush in to fill.”
Educated persons are generally
vehement in opposing legal re
strict ions against minorities, he
found, but also are more likely to
reject personal contacts with
members of minority groups.

THK ONLY instances in which
he found education had a marked
effect in lessening prejudice were
those involving persons of low
social and economic status. The
less educated among this group
expressed more prejudice than
those in higher status groups.

In relation to school desegrega
tion, Stember found the educated
supported it generally in the be
ginning but withdrew their sup
port as resistance in the South
■spread. He said this was not nec
essarily an indication of prejudice.
The willingness of the educated
“to sacrifice the rights of minori
ties (as exemplified by true school
integration) to a major personal
concern (the quality of their chil
dren’s education) probably re
flects the relative importance
which the educated attach to the
two issues."

of Rutgers University for the
American Jewish Committee. Its
basis is an analysis of public
opinion polls made during the
1940’s and early 1950’5.

UNTIL a generation ago, Stem
ber said, it was “believed that the
teaching of facts about minority
groups could do much to reduce
prejudice ... In recent years it
has no longer seemed so obvious
that classroom learning is an es
calator which automatically lifts
the individual to higher levels of
group undersatnding.”

In fact, .he said, it seems pos
sible that “the educational pro
cess, by scrupulously refraining
from teaching specific doctrines
may in effect bo creating a vacu
um which the prevailing winds of
prejudice might rush in to fill.”
Educated persons are generally
vehement in opposing legal re
strict ions against minorities, he
found, but also are more likely to
reject personal contacts with
members of minority groups.

THK ONLY instances in which
he found education had a marked
effect in lessening prejudice were
those involving persons of low
social and economic status. The
less educated among this group
expressed more prejudice than
those in higher status groups.

In relation to school desegrega
tion, Stember found the educated
supported it generally in the be
ginning but withdrew their sup
port as resistance in the South
■spread. He said this was not nec
essarily an indication of prejudice.
The willingness of the educated
“to sacrifice the rights of minori
ties (as exemplified by true school
integration) to a major personal
concern (the quality of their chil
dren’s education) probably re
flects the relative importance
which the educated attach to the
two issues."
