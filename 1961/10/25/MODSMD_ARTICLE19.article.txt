# NEXT STANFORD OPPONENT
## Haffner, Smith Lead Bruins In Big Five Opener at Farm 
### 
The powerful and swift UCLA
Bruins, after warming up for five
weeks against non-league oppon
ents, invade Stanford Stadium
Saturday afternoon.
Coach Bill Barnes brings his
charges northward after compil
ing a 3-2 record wins over Van
derbilt, Pittsburgh and the Air
Force Academy and losses to
Michigan and Ohio Slate.
IN' LOOKING for their first
AAWU decision the Bruins will
give Stanford some of the old
single-wing power. The tailback is
always the man who makes the
big plays and gets the headlines
and this season UCLA has two of
the best around,
Bobby Smith, after lettering for
two years as Bill Kilmer’s replace
ment, is one of the finest defensive
safety men on the coast and
showed what he could do on of
fense last season against Duke’s
Cotton Bowl team. Smith ran for
121 yards in 19 carries. Against
the Air Force Academy in UCLA’s
first game of the year the 190-
pound 6-foot senior scored all of
his team’s three touchdowns.
But Smith is not UCLA’s first
string tailback!
THAT DISTINCTION belongs
to flashy sophomore Mike Haff
ner. At 6-2 and 185 pounds Haffner
is not particularly strong, but he
can fly. He rambled for 120 yards,
including another of his spectac
ular touchdown jaunts last week
against Pitt. This time the light
ning struck from 25 yards out as
the speed boy swept around end
behind some great blocking.
If Haffner or Smith have any
weakness it may be in passing,
but lately the Sout blunders’ aerial
game has been improving.
Haffner’s fine performance last
week moved him past Smith as
the Bruins’ No. 1 ground gainer
after five games. By netting 157
yards against Vanderbilt and 120
against Pitt, his seasonal total is
now 337 to 330 for Smith, who
carried the ball only twice last
week for one short yard. Smith
had a charley horse, which has
since healed completely.
THK BRUINS are loaded with
backfield speed which extends

beyond Haffner and Smith to full
back Almose Thompson and wing
back Kermil Alexander. Alexan
der is a tremendous broken field
threat particularly on punt and
kick-off returns.
Thompson, who has alternated
with Joe Zeno, has rushed for 168
yards and close to four yards per
carry.

While most of the ropy goes to
the men who carry the ball, UCLA
is not just a team of heroes. In the
line there is all-coast left tackle
•Steve Bauwens and all-Big Five
right tackle Marshall Shirk.
Also included in the big crew is
Foster Andersen, Tony Fioren
tino, Phil Oram and Joe Bauwens,
brother of Steve.


UCLA’S KEY STRENGTH lies at tailback, where the Bruins have four
talented ball carriers, Keith Jensen (15) and Bobby Smith (19) re
turn from last year, along with Ezell Singleton. Sophomore Mike
Haffner has been a pleasant surprise.

give Stanford some of the old
single-wing power. The tailback is
always the man who makes the
big plays and gets the headlines
and this season UCLA has two of
the best around,
Bobby Smith, after lettering for
two years as Bill Kilmer’s replace
ment, is one of the finest defensive
safety men on the coast and
showed what he could do on of
fense last season against Duke’s
Cotton Bowl team. Smith ran for
121 yards in 19 carries. Against
the Air Force Academy in UCLA’s
first game of the year the 190-
pound 6-foot senior scored all of
his team’s three touchdowns.
But Smith is not UCLA’s first
string tailback!
THAT DISTINCTION belongs
to flashy sophomore Mike Haff
ner. At 6-2 and 185 pounds Haffner
is not particularly strong, but he
can fly. He rambled for 120 yards,
including another of his spectac
ular touchdown jaunts last week
against Pitt. This time the light
ning struck from 25 yards out as
the speed boy swept around end
behind some great blocking.
If Haffner or Smith have any
weakness it may be in passing,
but lately the Sout blunders’ aerial
game has been improving.
Haffner’s fine performance last
week moved him past Smith as
the Bruins’ No. 1 ground gainer
after five games. By netting 157
yards against Vanderbilt and 120
against Pitt, his seasonal total is
now 337 to 330 for Smith, who
carried the ball only twice last
week for one short yard. Smith
had a charley horse, which has
since healed completely.
THK BRUINS are loaded with
backfield speed which extends

beyond Haffner and Smith to full
back Almose Thompson and wing
back Kermil Alexander. Alexan
der is a tremendous broken field
threat particularly on punt and
kick-off returns.
Thompson, who has alternated
with Joe Zeno, has rushed for 168
yards and close to four yards per
carry.

While most of the ropy goes to
the men who carry the ball, UCLA
is not just a team of heroes. In the
line there is all-coast left tackle
•Steve Bauwens and all-Big Five
right tackle Marshall Shirk.
Also included in the big crew is
Foster Andersen, Tony Fioren
tino, Phil Oram and Joe Bauwens,
brother of Steve.


UCLA’S KEY STRENGTH lies at tailback, where the Bruins have four
talented ball carriers, Keith Jensen (15) and Bobby Smith (19) re
turn from last year, along with Ezell Singleton. Sophomore Mike
Haffner has been a pleasant surprise.
The powerful and swift UCLA
Bruins, after warming up for five
weeks against non-league oppon
ents, invade Stanford Stadium
Saturday afternoon.
Coach Bill Barnes brings his
charges northward after compil
ing a 3-2 record wins over Van
derbilt, Pittsburgh and the Air
Force Academy and losses to
Michigan and Ohio Slate.

AAWU decision the Bruins will
