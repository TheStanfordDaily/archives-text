# Kerensky Edits Study Of '17 Rule
## 
### 
Russia’s brief interlude with
democracy has been fully docu
mented for the first time in “The
Russian Provisional Government

—1917,” a three-volume study Just
published by the Stanford Press.
Supported by the Hoover Insti
tute, the study includes more
than 1.400 documents selected and
edited by Prof. Robert P. Brow
der, chairman of the University of
Colorado History Department, and
Alexander F. Kerensky, prime
minister of the Russian Provision
al Government.
VERY FEW of these source ma
terials have been translated pre
viously. The great majority are
drawn from the Hoover Institute’s
collection, the most complete set
of records on this period available
outside the Soviet Union.
The Institute provided funds to
taling nearly $90,000 for the four
year study.
"The importance of these vol
umes cannot be overemphasized.”
Kerensky comments.
“THEY OFFER not only a full
account of the legislative and ad
ministrative acts of the Provision
al Government as recorded in the
original minutes of the day-by-day
sessions of this government and
in other official documents, but
also an authentic record of the
military, political and social ac
complishments of the democratic
revolution of February, 1917.
Kerensky’s eight-month regime
has generally been studied only
as a prelude to the triumph of
communism in Russia. Historical
accounts of this period subse
quently published in Russia have
all been “falsifications,” Kerensky
declares.
