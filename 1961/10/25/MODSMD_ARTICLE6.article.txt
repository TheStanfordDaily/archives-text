# Big Ballot Set as 58 Seek Posts; 8 Men, Grade Vie for Yell-Leader
## 
### BILL REPPY 
An avalanche of petitions pour
ed in on the last day of nomina
tions yesterday to put the Stan
ford political wagon rolling in
high gear.
Thirty nominations swelled to
58 the number of candidates for
14 offices. There would have been
62 but for four withdrawals in the
head yell-leader race.
Yesterday there were no candi
dates for the Class of ’65 vice pres
idency—now there are 16 in the
running.
SEVEN additional nominations
for head yell-leader brought the
number of candidates to 13, but
the declinations of Judy Levin
(Union), Roger Solquist (ATO),
Edward “Bino” Creighton (Kappa
Sig) and Joe Wally (Theta Chi)
cut the raks to nine.
The Campaign which promises
to be a dilly—begins this morning.
Primary elections are Nov. 1-2
with finals Nov. 8-9.
ADDING spice to the already
juicy head yell-leader campaign
is a grubby wet-back known as
F.S.R., the mysterious Mexican.
His band of bandidos, F.S.R.’s fa
natic supporters, state he was de
ported from Mexico because his
humor was too gross. F.S.R. is as
tough as nails, they say. since he
was raised by a fat mamacita on
tequila, cactus and frejoles. “Bue
no,” was all F.S.R. had to say.
“Demaciado.”
Other candidates and their plat
forms:
BRUCE LEMM El Campo:
“Our team is out for blood. It is
high time to return to the ‘good
old days’ and show the ‘real spir
its’ in the stands with the most
bloody-thirsty yells and yell lead
ers.”
JOHN JONES Sigma Chi: “My
goal is to uphold, perhaps even to
raise the level of rooter-humor
here and to promote the health

and happiness of the male rooter.
Until the ratio drops to 1.01 to 1,
women will never sit with us, but
given their own leader, one day
they may root with us.”
DAVE KIESEL —AKL: “Down
with loud, obnoxious girls; for
ward with b.a.R.F.-type school
spirit.”
JOHN “C ANNONBALL” MAC
GREGOR Beta: “1 may not be
the most animated yell leader, but
I will have the biggest ball.”
PAGE EDWARDS —AIpha Belt:
“Bordering the acceptable, capital
izing on the clean.”
ANN KOVACOVICH. Carole
Hanson and Sue Bailey filed for
Branner LASSU representative.
Patricia Bush and Kitty Matthews
are out for Roble LASSU repre
sentative.
Two Phi Kaps, Bob Pettit and
John Bannister, bring to six the
number of candidates for two
men’s council positions. Larry
Lang and Allan Curr were the
seventh and eighth freshman men
to go out for class president. Jack
Toney filed for Wilbur LASSU
representative.

ment because his humor was too gross.
