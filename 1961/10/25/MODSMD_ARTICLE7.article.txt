# SU Alumni Conference Program Honored by National Council
## 
### 
The Stanford Alumni Associa
tion has been awarded an Honor
Citation in the American Alumni
Council's 1961 Alumni Service
Award competition, according to
Julie Hirsch, Student-Alumni Co
ordinator for the Stanford associ
ation.

The Association was honored
for its program of 15 alumni con
ferences held last year across the
nation and sponsored jointly by
the University, the Alumni Associ
ation and local Stanford Alumni
Clubs. Over 5550 people attended
the 1961 conferences, a 67 per cent
increase in the last four years.
THE Stanford Association was
also awarded the top national
award for membership activity.
The Association is first in the na
tion in ratio of those eligible who
voluntarily join it, Miss Hirsch
said.
Integral in the Stanford Associ
ation’s program is its new field of
student-alumni relations, headed

by Miss Hirsch, a 1960 Stanford
grad and former ASSU vice presi
dent and Daily staffer.

In a recent article Thomas Git
tins. Cornell’s Alumni Field Sec
retary said that this pioneering
Stanford program is “indeed a
landmark in the field of student
alumni relations,” adding that
“Stanford’s programs in effect
now and projected for future use
are so extensive that I cannot be
gin to include them in this re
port.”
THESE programs, said Miss
Hirsch, are mostly conducted on
an informal basis of aid to any
student, organization or living
group with a particular problem.
In addition to the physical fa
cilities available to any student
any time at the Association’s Bow
man Alumni House headquarters,
the program has included cooper
ation with student organizations
in preparing special events and
offers many services, including
that of a Notary Public.
