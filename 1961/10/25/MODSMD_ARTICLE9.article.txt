SAN FRANClSCO—Agreement on a new United Nations Sec
retary-General lias been reached, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Adlai
Stevenson said here last night.
Stevenson said Russia has agreed to a new Secretary-General.
We are very close to choosing a successor to the late Dag

Hammarskjold, he declared.
“A SOLUTION must bo found
within a few days. I believe it
will,” Stevenson predicted.
Burmese Ambassador to the
United Nations U Thant has been
mentioned as the most likely suc
cessor.

In a speech commemorating the
world parliament’s 16th anniver
sary. Stevenson urged America
to carry “a new spirit ... a new
courage . . . and self-restraint”
into the struggle for world peace.
He told a capacity crowd at the
Masonic Auditorium, “Since we
don’t want to die together we
must manage to live together.”

“WE SHALL not win any quick
peace by negotiation.”
The U.S. “as never before in
(its) history must study,” itself
and realize that the “present illu
sion of omnipotence to which we
. . . have clung so long” must be
discarded.

He pointed out that the U.S. ex
pected its democratic heritage to
sweep the world after World War
11, but that the problems which
prevented this are still with us.”

“The danger is ... we may go
from illusion to despair” that the
UN is useless in the quest for
peace, he said.

“THIS IS NO time for panic or
dismay. It is a time for seeing
with clear eyes . . . what must be
done.”

He called the United Nations the
“hope of the world” and said the
UN will not “turn against us.”
He said in referring to those
who have predicted doom for the
UN that “I’m not worried about
the voices of all-out fanaticism.

“I SHAKE your frustrations,
but I don’t share your fear,” he
declared in answering such critics.

He voiced concern over failure
of some members not paying for
the UN operation in the Congo. He
pointed out that “the bill will add
up to $l6O million by the end of
this month.”

“The stark fact is that if the
members will not pay for the
United Nations they will not have
it.” When this is realized, he said,
the ci’isis will be solved.
HE POINTED out that the
treasury of the UN will be empty
and its credit exhausted by March
1962 if financial support is not
forthcoming from member na
tions.

“The house is crowded . . . the
house is battered,” he said in re
ferring to the present state of the
UN. "It resounds endlessly with
family quarrels.
“The house is still standing.
“The UN has entered a period
of severe strain. It is most cer
tainly a time for words and deeds
of hope.”
‘Our country’s pride should be
that we stood by the United Na
tions ... in its time of hardest
trial,” he concluded.
