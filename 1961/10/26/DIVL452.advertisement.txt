THE DATING SEASON
I have recently returned from a tour of 950,000 American col
leges where I made a survey of undergraduate dating customs
and sold mechanical dogs, and I have tabulated my findings
and I am now prepared to tell you the simple secret of successful
dating.
The simple secret is simply this: a date is successful when the
man knows how to treat the girl.
And how does a girl like to be treated? If you want to know,
read and remember these four cardinal rules of dating:
1. A girl likes to he treated with respect.
When you call for your girl, do not drive up in front of the
sorority house and yell, “Hey, fat lady!” Get out of your car.
Walk respectfully to the door. Knock respectfully. When your
girl comes out, tug your forelock and say respectfully, “Good
evening, your honor.” Then offer her a Marlboro, for what
greater respect can you show your girl than to offer Marlboro
with its fine flavor and exclusive selectrate filter? It will in
dicate immediately that you respect her taste, respect her dis
cernment, respect her intelligence. So, good buddies, before
going out on a date, always remember to buy some Marlboros,
available in soft pack or flip-top box in all 50 of the United
States and also Cleveland.

2. A girl likes a good listener.
Do not monopolize the conversation. Let her talk while you
listen attentively. Make sure, however, that she is not herself
a good listener. I recollect a date I had once with a coed named
Greensleevcs Sigafoos, a lovely girl, but unfortunately a listener,
not a talker. I too was a listener so we just sat all night long,
each with his hand cupped over his ear, straining to catch a
word, not talking hour after hour until finally a policeman came
by and arrested us both for vagrancy. I did a year and a day.
She got by with a suspended sentence because she was the sole
support of her aged housemother.
S. A girl likes to be taken to nice places.
By “nice” places I do not mean expensive places. A girl does
not demand luxury. AH she asks is a place that is pleasant and
gracious. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, for example. Or
Mount Rushmore. Or the Taj Mahal. Or the Bureau of Weights
and Measures. Find places like these to take your girl. In no
circumstances must you take her to an oil-cracking plant,
4- A girl likes a man to he well-informed.
Come prepared with a few interesting facts that you can drop
casually into the conversation. Like this: “Did you know,
Snookiepuss, that when cattle, sheep, camels, goats, antelopes,
and other members of the cud-chewing family get up, they al
ways get up hind legs first?” Or this; “Are you aware, Hotlips,
that corn grows faster at night?” Or this: “By the way, Lover
head, Oslo did not become the capital of Norway till July 11,
1924.”
If you can slip enough of these nuggets into the conversation
before dinner, your date will grow too torpid to eat. Some men
save up to a half million dollars a year this way.
