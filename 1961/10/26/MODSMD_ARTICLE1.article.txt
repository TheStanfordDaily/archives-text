# IFC to Vote On 2 New Rush Plans
## 
### 
The Inter • Fraternity Council
will vote Monday night on two
new fraternity rush proposals.
If neither proposal is passed, the
present system of rush will con
tinue, according to IFC President
Swede Pierson.
The first plan, proposed by the
Inter-Fraternity Council, would
go into effect this spring. It
would maintain rush during
spring quarter hut would move
it forward three days into spring
vacation.
THOSE in favor of the plan,
said Pierson, feel that this would
minimize upset study schedules
of rushees and upperclassmen
alike, thereby appeasing faculty
who have raised a great hue
against the present rush sched
ule.
The alternate plan is the so
called “Wilbur Sponsors’ Plan,”
also favored by Dean of Men
William G. Craig. This program
would eliminate the no-contact
rule between fraternity members
and freshmen and would schedule
formal rush just prior to registra
tion of the sophomores. This, as
Craig said in Tuesday’s Daily,
might allow freshmen to continue
their loyalty to their freshman
houses, cut down freshman drink
ing, and eliminate study problems
that the present rush program
causes.

CRAIG TOLD The Daily yes
terday, “I haven’t yet had time
to read the complete IFC pro
posal, so I’m in no position to
comment.”

Opinions on Ihe two proposals
are split, said IFC representative
Ed Eschhach. Many members of
IFC feel that fraternities should
assume responsibility in response
to faculty pressure for a new sys
tem which eliminates lost study
time. Still others are in favor of
maintaining the status quo as a
system which has operated suc
cessfully in recent years.
“From all indications," Pierson
said, “the pre-sophomore rush
proposal will be defeated. It has
some good points, but it is not
feasible or desirable at this time.
I favor the IFC plan which, when
perfected, should work out.”

DAVE NOE AX, Sigma Chi
president, said yesterday that
“the IFC plan is acceptable. It
is the most constructive; it re
moves the objections that the fac
ulty has that rush disrupts
studies and classes.”

'Tm not in favor of the IFC
plan,” Tom Crosby, Delta Upsilon
president, said. “There would be
too many problems arising from
the shortened vacation. I’m for
the plan we have now. It’s not
perfect, but it's by far the best.”
Delta Chi president Don Ball
said, “To move rush forward has
considerable merit, but many
times Easter falls on the Sunday
just before registration, and this
is my main objection.”

Doug Patton, president of Delta
Kappa Epsilon, thinks the IFC
plan “good in that it stops the
academic problem. But I don't
see it as a solution to divided
allegiance. The pre ■ sophomore
rush could solve this problem,
but it is not economically feas
ible.”

see it as a solution to divided
allegiance. The pre ■ sophomore
rush could solve this problem,
but it is not economically feas
ible.”
The Inter • Fraternity Council
will vote Monday night on two
new fraternity rush proposals.
If neither proposal is passed, the
present system of rush will con
tinue, according to IFC President
Swede Pierson.
The first plan, proposed by the
Inter-Fraternity Council, would
go into effect this spring. It
would maintain rush during
spring quarter hut would move
it forward three days into spring
vacation.
THOSE in favor of the plan,
said Pierson, feel that this would
minimize upset study schedules
of rushees and upperclassmen
alike, thereby appeasing faculty
who have raised a great hue
against the present rush sched
ule.
The alternate plan is the so
called “Wilbur Sponsors’ Plan,”
also favored by Dean of Men
William G. Craig. This program
would eliminate the no-contact
rule between fraternity members
and freshmen and would schedule
formal rush just prior to registra
tion of the sophomores. This, as
Craig said in Tuesday’s Daily,
might allow freshmen to continue
their loyalty to their freshman
houses, cut down freshman drink
ing, and eliminate study problems
that the present rush program
causes.

CRAIG TOLD The Daily yes
terday, “I haven’t yet had time
to read the complete IFC pro
posal, so I’m in no position to
comment.”

Opinions on Ihe two proposals
are split, said IFC representative
Ed Eschhach. Many members of
IFC feel that fraternities should
assume responsibility in response
to faculty pressure for a new sys
tem which eliminates lost study
time. Still others are in favor of
maintaining the status quo as a
system which has operated suc
cessfully in recent years.
“From all indications," Pierson
said, “the pre-sophomore rush
proposal will be defeated. It has
some good points, but it is not
feasible or desirable at this time.
I favor the IFC plan which, when
perfected, should work out.”

DAVE NOE AX, Sigma Chi
president, said yesterday that
“the IFC plan is acceptable. It
is the most constructive; it re
moves the objections that the fac
ulty has that rush disrupts
studies and classes.”

'Tm not in favor of the IFC
plan,” Tom Crosby, Delta Upsilon
president, said. “There would be
too many problems arising from
the shortened vacation. I’m for
the plan we have now. It’s not
perfect, but it's by far the best.”
Delta Chi president Don Ball
said, “To move rush forward has
considerable merit, but many
times Easter falls on the Sunday
just before registration, and this
is my main objection.”

Doug Patton, president of Delta
Kappa Epsilon, thinks the IFC
plan “good in that it stops the
academic problem. But I don't
see it as a solution to divided
allegiance. The pre ■ sophomore
rush could solve this problem,
but it is not economically feas
