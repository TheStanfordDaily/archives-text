# Walter Lippmann Khrushchev's Speech
## 
### 
It is too oarly to know what the
experts will find when they have
examined the whole text of Mr.
Khrushchev’s long speech. But in
the reports we now have there are
at least three significant points.

the present the Soviet Union is by
no means omnipotent, either for
war or in peace. The Soviet Union
is having to learn, as we too of
course, are having to learn, that
all power is relative, and that no
one can have his way absolutely.

One is that the Soviet Union will
explode a 50-megaton bomb on
Oct. 31. The second is that in the
Berlin encounter the deadline of
Dec. 31, which amounted to an ul
timatum, has been lifted. The
third is that there is a capital
shortage in the Soviet Union
which compels a pause for at least
a year in starting new industrial
projects.
I venture to think that these
three points are aspects of the
same condition of affairs. All
three indicate that when seen
from the inside, as Mr. Khrush
chev sees it, the power of the So
viet Union is limited.
WHATEVER MAY be the Com
nunist dreams of the future, in

The 50-megaton bomb is an ad
mission, so it seems to me, that
while the Soviet Union is ahead
of us in rockets, it is behind us
in nuclear weapons. The 50-mega
ton bomb is not an efficient weap
on against the United States. Most
likely, it is intended to be an in
strument of intimidation in Eu
rope.

As such, it is probably a dud
even if it is exploded. For the pre
vailing European view is fatalistic.
There is no difference between
being destroyed by three 20-mega
ton bombs and being destroyed by
three 50-megaton bombs.
I CANNOT help thinking that
the coming 50-megaton bomb, and
the 100-megaton bomb which is
supposed to be in reserve, are the
cover for the realization that nu
clear war is intolerable and must
be avoided. Translated into our
own current jargon, it is a hard
boiled way of taking a soft-boiled
line. The lifting of the deadline
for a settlement about Berlin con
firms what was achieved in the
Rusk-Gromyko talks. This makes
it possible to negotiate. But it does
not offer any promise that the ne
gotiation will lead to agreements.
On the basic issue, which is the
political connection between West
Berlin and West Germany, the
two sides are far apart and nego
tiation is bound to be long and
stubborn.

Negotiation will, however, be
possible, and therefore might suc
ceed, if there are no ultimata
backed by military measures that
could “escalate,” that is to say
could spiral upward, into nuclear
war.

THE THIRD point, the pause
for a year in new capital invest
ment. may be the most significant
of all. The Soviet economy, which
is progressing spectacularly in in
dustry, rests on an agricultural
economy which is extremely inef
ficient and backward compared
with our own, with Canada’s, with
that of most of Western Europe,
that of Australia and New Zea
land.

This weak and expensive and in
efficient agricultural base is prob
ably the underlying reason for the
shortage of capital. This shortage
of capital is made up of a short
age of labor, which is held on the
farms, and of raw materials
which are not adequately pro
duced.

This indicates where and why
and how the Western world can
and will compete successfully with
the Communist orbit. On the con
tinent in Western Europe today
there is in progress a highly suc
cessful industrial revolution.

IN THE efficiency of produc
tion, and in the rate of growth, It
is more than a match for the re
markable developments of the So
viet economy. It is demonstrating
that a progressive economy is
quite possible within the Western
liberal way of life.
At the same time, there is under
way an agricultural revolution
which together with the industrial
development is putting the gen
eral standard of life in Western
Europe far above anything
achieved, or even promised, in any
Communist country.
It is here that the future of the
Western society begins. Great
Britain is joining the Western
continent. The Commonwealth,
like the French Community, will
become associated with it, and in
not too many years we shall work
out a close relation with it. All this
will be something to live for. All
this will come to pass as we shake
off the nightmare that the world
is going to be destroyed in a fit of
suicidal mania.

This indicates where and why
and how the Western world can
and will compete successfully with
the Communist orbit. On the con
tinent in Western Europe today
there is in progress a highly suc
cessful industrial revolution.

IN THE efficiency of produc
tion, and in the rate of growth, It
is more than a match for the re
markable developments of the So

that a progressive economy is
quite possible within the Western
liberal way of life.
At the same time, there is under
way an agricultural revolution
which together with the industrial
development is putting the gen
eral standard of life in Western
Europe far above anything
achieved, or even promised, in any
Communist country.
It is here that the future of the
Western society begins. Great
Britain is joining the Western
continent. The Commonwealth,
like the French Community, will
become associated with it, and in
not too many years we shall work
out a close relation with it. All this
will be something to live for. All
this will come to pass as we shake
off the nightmare that the world
is going to be destroyed in a fit of
suicidal mania.

It is too oarly to know what the
experts will find when they have
examined the whole text of Mr.
Khrushchev’s long speech. But in
the reports we now have there are
at least three significant points.

the present the Soviet Union is by
no means omnipotent, either for
war or in peace. The Soviet Union
is having to learn, as we too of
course, are having to learn, that
all power is relative, and that no
one can have his way absolutely.

One is that the Soviet Union will
explode a 50-megaton bomb on
Oct. 31. The second is that in the
Berlin encounter the deadline of
Dec. 31, which amounted to an ul
timatum, has been lifted. The
third is that there is a capital
shortage in the Soviet Union
which compels a pause for at least
a year in starting new industrial
projects.
I venture to think that these
three points are aspects of the
same condition of affairs. All
three indicate that when seen
from the inside, as Mr. Khrush
chev sees it, the power of the So
viet Union is limited.
WHATEVER MAY be the Com
nunist dreams of the future, in

The 50-megaton bomb is an ad
mission, so it seems to me, that
while the Soviet Union is ahead
of us in rockets, it is behind us
in nuclear weapons. The 50-mega
ton bomb is not an efficient weap
on against the United States. Most
likely, it is intended to be an in
strument of intimidation in Eu
rope.

As such, it is probably a dud
even if it is exploded. For the pre
vailing European view is fatalistic.
There is no difference between
being destroyed by three 20-mega
ton bombs and being destroyed by
three 50-megaton bombs.
I CANNOT help thinking that
the coming 50-megaton bomb, and
the 100-megaton bomb which is
supposed to be in reserve, are the
cover for the realization that nu
clear war is intolerable and must
be avoided. Translated into our
own current jargon, it is a hard
boiled way of taking a soft-boiled
line. The lifting of the deadline
for a settlement about Berlin con
firms what was achieved in the
Rusk-Gromyko talks. This makes
it possible to negotiate. But it does
not offer any promise that the ne
gotiation will lead to agreements.
On the basic issue, which is the
political connection between West
Berlin and West Germany, the
two sides are far apart and nego
tiation is bound to be long and
stubborn.

Negotiation will, however, be
possible, and therefore might suc
ceed, if there are no ultimata
backed by military measures that
could “escalate,” that is to say
could spiral upward, into nuclear
war.

THE THIRD point, the pause
for a year in new capital invest
ment. may be the most significant
of all. The Soviet economy, which
is progressing spectacularly in in
dustry, rests on an agricultural
economy which is extremely inef
ficient and backward compared
with our own, with Canada’s, with
that of most of Western Europe,
that of Australia and New Zea
land.

This weak and expensive and in
efficient agricultural base is prob
ably the underlying reason for the
shortage of capital. This shortage
of capital is made up of a short
age of labor, which is held on the
farms, and of raw materials
which are not adequately pro
duced.

and how the Western world can
and will compete successfully with

Rusk-Gromyko talks. This makes
it possible to negotiate. But it does
not offer any promise that the ne
gotiation will lead to agreements.
On the basic issue, which is the
political connection between West
Berlin and West Germany, the
two sides are far apart and nego
tiation is bound to be long and
stubborn.

Negotiation will, however, be
possible, and therefore might suc
ceed, if there are no ultimata
backed by military measures that
could “escalate,” that is to say
could spiral upward, into nuclear
war.

THE THIRD point, the pause
for a year in new capital invest
ment. may be the most significant
of all. The Soviet economy, which
is progressing spectacularly in in
dustry, rests on an agricultural
economy which is extremely inef
ficient and backward compared
with our own, with Canada’s, with
that of most of Western Europe,
that of Australia and New Zea
land.

This weak and expensive and in
efficient agricultural base is prob
ably the underlying reason for the
shortage of capital. This shortage
of capital is made up of a short
age of labor, which is held on the
farms, and of raw materials
which are not adequately pro
duced.

This indicates where and why
and how the Western world can
and will compete successfully with
the Communist orbit. On the con
tinent in Western Europe today
there is in progress a highly suc
cessful industrial revolution.

IN THE efficiency of produc
tion, and in the rate of growth, It
is more than a match for the re
markable developments of the So
viet economy. It is demonstrating
that a progressive economy is
quite possible within the Western
liberal way of life.
At the same time, there is under
way an agricultural revolution
which together with the industrial
development is putting the gen
eral standard of life in Western
Europe far above anything
achieved, or even promised, in any
Communist country.
It is here that the future of the
Western society begins. Great
Britain is joining the Western
continent. The Commonwealth,
like the French Community, will
become associated with it, and in
not too many years we shall work
out a close relation with it. All this
will be something to live for. All
this will come to pass as we shake
off the nightmare that the world
is going to be destroyed in a fit of
suicidal mania.

It is too oarly to know what the
experts will find when they have
examined the whole text of Mr.
Khrushchev’s long speech. But in
the reports we now have there are
at least three significant points.

the present the Soviet Union is by
no means omnipotent, either for
war or in peace. The Soviet Union
is having to learn, as we too of
course, are having to learn, that
all power is relative, and that no
one can have his way absolutely.

One is that the Soviet Union will
explode a 50-megaton bomb on
Oct. 31. The second is that in the
Berlin encounter the deadline of
Dec. 31, which amounted to an ul
timatum, has been lifted. The
third is that there is a capital
shortage in the Soviet Union
which compels a pause for at least
a year in starting new industrial
projects.
I venture to think that these
three points are aspects of the
same condition of affairs. All
three indicate that when seen
from the inside, as Mr. Khrush
chev sees it, the power of the So
viet Union is limited.
WHATEVER MAY be the Com
nunist dreams of the future, in

The 50-megaton bomb is an ad
mission, so it seems to me, that
while the Soviet Union is ahead
of us in rockets, it is behind us
in nuclear weapons. The 50-mega
ton bomb is not an efficient weap
on against the United States. Most
likely, it is intended to be an in
strument of intimidation in Eu
rope.

As such, it is probably a dud
even if it is exploded. For the pre
vailing European view is fatalistic.
There is no difference between
being destroyed by three 20-mega
ton bombs and being destroyed by
three 50-megaton bombs.
I CANNOT help thinking that
the coming 50-megaton bomb, and
the 100-megaton bomb which is
supposed to be in reserve, are the
cover for the realization that nu
clear war is intolerable and must
be avoided. Translated into our
own current jargon, it is a hard
boiled way of taking a soft-boiled
line. The lifting of the deadline
for a settlement about Berlin con
firms what was achieved in the
Rusk-Gromyko talks. This makes
it possible to negotiate. But it does
