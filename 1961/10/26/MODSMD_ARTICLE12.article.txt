We would like to know if Bill
Griffin has any affiliation with
the Stanford Morality League. His
article apears to reveal an atti
tude of that tenor.
Charles Wetzel
Garry Garrettson
Editor, The Daily:
We were shocked to find that
senior men were being interrupt
ed from bestowing upon their
dates the honor of becoming Stan
ford women.
This logical and heartwarming
tradition must be salvaged at all
costs. Therefore, if such demon
strations (like that of Monday
night) continue to occur we feel
that the traditional site in which
to become a Stanford woman
should be changed from Inner
Quad to the eighteenth green of
the golf course, or inside Memori
al Church.
In either of these places water
bagging would be less likely to
occur and the scope of the tradi
tion could assume a far deeper
significance.

SOPHOMORE RUSH
Editor, The Daily:
The animal “attack” of several
hundred freshmen on the full
mooners Monday night casts con
siderable doubt on the Wilbur
sponsors’ recent proposal of soph
omore year rushing.
The sponsors would like to leave
more lime (spring quarter) for
the continuation of their laudable
but idealistic freshman program,
to keep Wilbur a cohesive unit all
year.

If the display Monday were an
isolated incident, it could be dis
missed with a reprimand. But it
clearly fits into the old pattern
of disorderliness, panty-raids on
Stern, and general immaturity
which has always made Wilbur
the most unpleasant place on
campus in which to live.

I admire the sponsors’ efforts
to cope with the problem of or
ganizing freshmen, but I see no
reason for a further six-month de
lay in allowing the freshmen to
pledge a fraternity, if they wish
to do so.

Those who know the Row know
that only a few houses are really
“wild,” while the others produce
the great majority of campus
leaders.

Let the immature freshmen
take their water bombs to the im
mature houses; let the competent
freshmen associate with the com
petent houses, and not be forced
to spend spring quarter in the un
natural company of Wilbur Hall.

We were shocked to find that
senior men were being interrupt
ed from bestowing upon their
dates the honor of becoming Stan
ford women.
This logical and heartwarming
tradition must be salvaged at all
costs. Therefore, if such demon
strations (like that of Monday
night) continue to occur we feel
that the traditional site in which
to become a Stanford woman
should be changed from Inner
Quad to the eighteenth green of
the golf course, or inside Memori
al Church.
In either of these places water
bagging would be less likely to
occur and the scope of the tradi
tion could assume a far deeper
significance.

The animal “attack” of several
hundred freshmen on the full
mooners Monday night casts con
siderable doubt on the Wilbur
sponsors’ recent proposal of soph
omore year rushing.
The sponsors would like to leave
more lime (spring quarter) for
the continuation of their laudable
but idealistic freshman program,
to keep Wilbur a cohesive unit all
year.

If the display Monday were an
isolated incident, it could be dis
missed with a reprimand. But it
clearly fits into the old pattern
of disorderliness, panty-raids on
Stern, and general immaturity
which has always made Wilbur
the most unpleasant place on
campus in which to live.

I admire the sponsors’ efforts
to cope with the problem of or
ganizing freshmen, but I see no
reason for a further six-month de
lay in allowing the freshmen to
pledge a fraternity, if they wish
to do so.

Those who know the Row know
that only a few houses are really
“wild,” while the others produce
the great majority of campus
leaders.

Let the immature freshmen
take their water bombs to the im
mature houses; let the competent
freshmen associate with the com
petent houses, and not be forced
to spend spring quarter in the un
natural company of Wilbur Hall.

We would like to know if Bill
Griffin has any affiliation with
the Stanford Morality League. His
article apears to reveal an atti
