# STAFF OPINION
## Peace Corps 'Flaws' Scored 
### BOSS HERMANN 
Were it not for the dedication
to high purposes of Sargent
Schriver and his buddies down to
Stanford’s star political science
graduate Pete Grothe, I would
have litlle sympathy for them and
their floundering progeny, the
Peace Corps.
But I remember the ring of sin
cerity in Grot he’s voice last spring
in a Stanford debate before Life
and Time correspondents as he de
fended the Peace Corps against
all constructive criticisms, and I
could not help but be impressed.
So with the apprehension that
the weight of Peace Corps emo
tion may again overwhelm seri
ous discussion, I will try to point
out some of the flaws in the Peace
Corps which have become obvious
in the first several weeks of its

operation and which should have
been evident when the agency was
first conceived and planned.
MISS MARGERY Michelmore
is now back in the Peace Corps
training camp in Puerto Rico, pre
sumably to take a course in “How
to Write a Postcard,” after her
embarrassing encounter with an
gry Nigerian students. Perhaps
many of the other Corpsmen
should still be at the camp,
P’or as Miss Michelmore admit
ted in her controversial postcard,
“with all the training that we have
had we really were not prepared
for the squalor and absolutely
primitive living conditions ram
pant in both the city and the
bush.”
This points up one of the chief
flaws of the Peace Corps the
lack of sufficient training.

BIOFORK members of the Peace
Corps are sent to their respective
countries, they are to undergo a
training period of between six
weeks and six months, during
which time they are expected to
gain a working knowledge of the
language, customs, institutions,
and thought patterns of the coun
tries to which they are going. On
top of this, they are supposed to
learn some of the rudiments of
diplomacy.
It is simply poor planning to ex
pect that this vital training can
be completed in a minimum crash
program of six weeks. The length
of the training program is placed
in perspective when we note that
the State Department will not
•send anyone abroad for any pur
pose unless he has had at least 18
months of training.

Not only is the training pro
gram too short, but several vital
elements seem to have been left
out, notably training in political
and psychological warfare.

THESE ARE THE devices that
a highly trained opposition is us
ing against the Peace Corps, and
it is certainly not too much to ex
pect that Corpsmen should be
trained to I’ecognize and counter
these attacks.
For instance. Miss Michelmore
was evidently not warned that a
truthful, but indiscreet, statement
on the back of a postcard could be
latched upon by enemies of the
Peace Corps, Communist or other
wise, and turned into an embar
rassing international incident in
which the names of the Peace
Corps and the United States would
be discredited.

Not only should Miss Michel
more have been aware of the con
sequences of her postcard, but she
should have been provided with
the necessary tools for counter-at
tack. It might have been possible
to whip up an anti-Soviet demon
stration by circulating mimeo
graphed sheets telling of the re
peated humiliation and abuse of
African students studying in the
Soviet Union.

WE ARE TOLD by organizers
of the Peace Corps that one of its
main strengths lies in its ideal
ism. They conceive of it not as an
instrument to further the cold war
interests of the United States, but
as a group of idealistic young peo
ple going into the backward na
tions to help their follow man in
the interests of a better world.

They might succeed, were it not
for the existence of a well-trained,
militant opposition serving the in
terests of International Commu
nism. Given the existence of this
foe, the idealism of the Peace
Corps may prove to be its greatest
drawback, blinding its members
to the things which must be done

—some of them far from idealistic:
—if they are to accomplish their
worthy objectives.
