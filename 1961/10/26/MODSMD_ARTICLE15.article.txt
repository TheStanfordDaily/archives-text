# SOVIET CIVIL DEFENSE
## No Signs of Shelter Program Observed 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: At a time
when many Americans are con
cerned about civil defense in their
country the question of what is
being done in the Soviet Union
arises. In the following dispatch
tire chief of tire United Press In
ternational Moscow bureau sup

MOSCOW (UPD—“What would
you do if a nuclear war started?”
said Ivan to Dmitri.
“I would get into a shroud and
walk slowly toward the ceme
tery,” replied Dmitri.
“Why slowly?” said Ivan.
“In order to avoid panic,” an
swered Dmitri.
THIS grim joke is typical of the
sophisticated Russian’s attitude
toward civil defense. There ap
pears to be little widespread civil
defense preparations here and lit
tle public interest in such prepa
rations. At least part of this atti
tude ivdup-iTi-The Lriicrat'fetTnig
that there can bo no defense in a
nuclear war.
The Soviet press treats Ameri
can civil defense moves—includ
ing shelter building as “hys
teria.” Many Russians seem to
agree.

This does not mean Soviet au
thorities neglect the problem.
There are reports that shelters
exist for top government offices
and ministries and important in
dustrial plants.
BUT NO foreign observer has
seen any shelters. The average
citizen is unaware of the existence
of shelters, in contrast to the pe
riod before World War II when
most apartment houses had im
provised basement shelters.
Moscow subway stations, some
of which are very deep under
ground, were used as bombshel
ters during the war. But most of
them were built in the mid-thir
ties when nuclear weapons did not
exist.

There are subways only in Mos
cow, Leningrad and Kiev, and
they could accommodate only a
fraction of the population of the
three largest cities of the Soviet
Union.

VENTILATION systems of the
subways are pre-war and en
trances are wide open. There is no
provision for storing food or
water. Considerable alteration
would be necessary to make the
subways immune to radioactive
fallout.

The last time this correspondent
heard air raid sirens here was in
1943, when German troops were
several scoie miles from the capi
tal. There have been no public
drills or alerts since before the
war, when whole factory crews
and school student bodies walked
the streets in gas masks.
It is possible that key factories

occasionally have drills, but they
are unknown to the general pub
lic. Nor is there anything com
parable to the practice alerts in
the United States, which the So
viet press ridicules as “artificial
ly fostered mass hysteria.”

A DOZEN Soviet citizens on the
street were questioned by United
Press International about what
they would do if nuclear war
started suddenly.

Most shrugged their shoulders
in surprise, as if to say, “Are you
out of your mind?” Others indig
nantly muttered something to the
effect, “He must be an American
provocateur.”

Housing in Russia is largely a
state enterprise, and the state ap
pears too busy with a fantastic
housing program to worry about
shelters. Cellars of new eight to
10-floor housing compounds are
too shallow and too small for con
version into shelters.

THERE HAS been no campaign
for home-built shelters, nor have
stores advertised do-it-yourself

k'its. If a private-individual want
ed to build a shelter he would
have considerable trouble finding
bricks, cement, nails or wood.
However, there have been sev
eral books and pamphlets on the
dangers of radiation and what to
do if and when exposed to it. Most
of the books are of a medical first
aid type.
Mass circulation newspapers and
magazines entirely ignore the civil
defense problem.

Most shrugged their shoulders
in surprise, as if to say, “Are you
out of your mind?” Others indig

Housing in Russia is largely a
state enterprise, and the state ap
pears too busy with a fantastic
housing program to worry about
shelters. Cellars of new eight to
10-floor housing compounds are
too shallow and too small for con
version into shelters.

THERE HAS been no campaign
for home-built shelters, nor have
stores advertised do-it-yourself

k'its. If a private-individual want
ed to build a shelter he would
have considerable trouble finding
bricks, cement, nails or wood.
However, there have been sev
eral books and pamphlets on the
dangers of radiation and what to
do if and when exposed to it. Most
of the books are of a medical first
aid type.
Mass circulation newspapers and
magazines entirely ignore the civil
defense problem.
