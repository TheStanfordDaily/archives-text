# Few Hurt by VOPOS' Fire

BERLIN (UPD—The VOPOS
on Berlin’s East-West city border
do a lot of shooting these days but
few people get hurt.
The VOPOS—short for “Peo
ple’s Police”—fire at many East
Berliners who try to jump the
barbed wire to freedom.
But their aim is bad.
“Communist officers have told
East German police to be trigger
happy,” a West Berlin police offi
cer said. “But most of these poor
kids that are doing their duty at
the wall are very unhappy about
it.”

MOST EAST German youths
certainly have not joined the Com
munist “alert police” because they
wanted to kill. They became po
licemen because they could not
help it.

There is no conscription in East
Germany. But every 18-year-old
boy has to Join the “armed forces

of Germany’s first workers and
peasants state,” as the Commu
nists put it.
A boy who has not served in the
army or in the police would not be
admitted to a university. Working
in a state-run factory, he could not
get a raise in wages. After he has
married, state-run housing com
panies would not let him a room
or a flat.
SO EAST GERMAN youths are
forced to “volunteer” for the
armed forces.

The police officers are Commu
nists. But most VOPOS are not.
The rank and file VOPO is like
the boy next door. He has learned
a trade and wants to make money
at it. Or he has completed secon
dary school and wants to study at
a university. But ho cannot un
less he has served in the armed
forces for two, three or—if he
wants to be promoted to sergeant
rank—five years.
Most VOPOS do not like the bor
der wall that separates Berlin.

But behind them there are Com
munist officers who gave orders
to shoot at any East Berliner who
tries to escape to West Berlin.
