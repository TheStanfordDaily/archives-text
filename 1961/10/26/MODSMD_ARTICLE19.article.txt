# Faculty Moves To New Offices
## 
### 
Members of Stanford’s over
crowded staff and faculty were
able to stretch their legs this
week when they moved into new
garden-patio-type campus offices
built during the summer.
The four-unit, 28,000-square-foot
building group is scheduled for
completion by Monday by Eichler
Homes, Ihc. of Palo Alto. Con
struction began the end of last
June.
First to move into the new quar
ters were members of the Math
Department. They occupy the U
shaped Cedar Hall, along with
members of the School of Mathe
matics Study Group and the Insti
tute for the Study of Human
Problems.
Several other faculty members
of the office of admissions of
Stanford’s Graduate School of
Business have moved into the
three-wing Cypress Hall.
The remaining halls, Spruce
and Redwood, will be occupied by
the Business School personnel and
by the staff of Stanford’s new In
ternational Center for the Ad
vancement of Management Educa
tion. This center was formed last
year under a $3,500,000 Ford
grant.
Located just west of Physics
Lecture Hall in the vicinity of
Ventura Hall, the buildings cost
approximately $340,000, including
a 160-car parking lot, access roads,
and some landscaping. Additional
landscaping is planned, along with
a future road that will connect
