## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (UPD— Johnny
and Jane don’t necessarily need
to say a daily pledge of allegiance
in California schools but they
must have some “appropriate pa
triotic exercises.”
This preliminary ruling came
Tuesday from attorneys for the
state Department of Education. It
was made public by Public In
struction Superintendent Roy
Simpson.

Simpson said he would present
the finding to the state Board of
Education Nov. 9 in Los Angeles.
In brief, the ruling made these
major points:
That the Legislature In 1961
pre-empted the pledge of alle
giace field with a bill introduced
by Assemblyman Louis Francis,
R-San Mateo, which required a
pledge or other appropriate pa
triotic exercise at the beginning
of each school day.
—The state Board of Education
has no implied authority to regu
late how and when the pledge
should be said and certainly could
not make a regulation that would
be “inconsistent” with the 1961
statute.
That a regulation adopted by

the board two years ago requiring
a daily pledge could be amended
to agree with the new law, but
could not conflict with it.
“The statute fails to confer
upon the state board authority to
enlarge upon, restrict or define
the patriotic exercise required to
be conducted daily,” the attorneys
ruled.
