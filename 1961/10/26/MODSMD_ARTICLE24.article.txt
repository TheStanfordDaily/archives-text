A tremendous line. Good, fast backs.
That’s the story from Westwood land where UCLA is preparing
for Saturday’s AAWU encounter with Stanford’s highly surprising
Indians.
It has all the qualities that have made Bruin lines so dangerous
in the past speed, quickness, agility. Plus one thing new—size.
Simply put, this is the biggest line to ever bulge from within the
Bruins’ powder blue jersies. It averages a mere 222 pounds per man
from tackle to tackle. But with the size, little of the' speed that has
always characterized Bruin lines is gone.
the TWO key men in the Bruin starting line are right tackle
Marshall Shirk (237* and center

Ron Hull, tho baby of the line at
205 pounds. Both are tough, ex
perienced seniors. Both are out
standing two-way performers.
But here the Bruin power
doesn’t end. Opposite Shirk at left
tackle is currently Foster Ander
son (235), who started the season
at third string but with his bril
liant play during the past two
weeks ho has elevated himself to
the starting team.
And while the Bruins have*tem
porarily lost All-Coast Tackle
Steve Bauwens to a knee injury,
they still have 225-pound Tony Fi
orentino, a junior terror, to back
up Anderson. Backing up Shirk
the Bruins have junior Phil Oram.

AT GUARDS the Bruins are
really well fixed, too. For start
ers they have a pair of tough, ex
perienced seniors in Frank Macari

(222) and Tom Paton (215), And juniors Dave Stout, Dick Allen and
Joe Bauwens give Barnes plenty of depth.
Talent Galore at Tailback
Two of the brightest lights on the Bruin squad this fall, both
sophomores, are not interior linemen however.
ONK IS tailback Mike Haffner, who in his last two games has
gained 277 yards rushing and now is the conference leader in that
department. But despite Haffner’s heroics, it will he Bobby Smith,
the conference’s leading scorer and number two rusher who will
start at tailback.

Bobby has just recovered from a charley horse and should he in
top form. He is also a standout for the Bruins on defense.

The other standout sophomore has been Mel Profit. Mel is big
by all standards, 6-4 Vz, 215 pounds. He excells on defense—specializ
ing in batting opponents’ passes down their throats and making onfe
handed interceptions (which he did last Saturday against Pittsburgh.
It’s a real good Bruin team. The only thing that has held it down
has been the lack of a genuine passing threat.
If they find their passing threat this weekend, the Bruins could
come home with plenty of Indian scalps.
