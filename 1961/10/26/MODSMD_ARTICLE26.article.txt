# Phi Sigs In Romp
## 
### 
The passing combination of Tek
Kimbell to Bob Schulz yesterday
proved too much for the Chi Psis,
conqueror of the Sigma Chis.
In a 25-0 rout Kimbell hit
Schulz with three scoring aerials
â€”the last one a 50-yard run-pass
spectacular,
A Kimbell pass to Ken Wata
nabe put the last Phi Sig points
on the scoreboard.
Other scores: Arroyo df. Tran
cos 6-0, Otero I df. Cedro I 20-0,
Madera df. Soto I 24-0, Fiji I df.
Dekes 19-0.
