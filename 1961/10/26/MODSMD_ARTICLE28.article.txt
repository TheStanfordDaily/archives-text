# MEET UCLA IN STADIUM SATURDAY
## Cards Working Hard 
### 
After a discouraging 13-0 loss in
its Big Five opener, Stanford’s
varsity football team is working
harder than ever to prepare for
the powerful UCLA Bruins. The
Indians host the Southlanders in
the Stadium Saturday.

Coach Jack Curtice has put his
charges through a series of work
outs that have been longer than
any on the Farm for the past few
years. After last week’s showing
against Washington, the Cards
have been concentrating on de
fense.
THE BRUINS own the AAWIJ’s
most productive ground attack,
averaging 228 yards per game. In
Bob Smith and Mike Haffner they
have the two leading rushers.
The Cards front line has had
little trouble stopping anything
coming over (he middle, hut lacks
the overall speed to cover on
•sweeps.
Curtice had another dose of bad
news this week when he learned
that Al Hildebrand, who started
at tackle for the Cards in Seattle,
will be sidelined with an injured
foot.
THIS CUTS the Tribe's tackle
corps to just three w'ho have any
game experience. C. B. Simons
and Frank Atkinson probably will
get the call with Randy Vahan
waiting in the wings.
Hard-running Ken Babajian will
return to the lineup after missing
a week with a hip point. The little
sophomore who stand only 5-8 but
weighs 190, has been called by his
coach the best running fullback
on the squad. Babajian probably
will not get the starting assign
ment though, since Ed Cummings
has been looking good on defense.
THE REMAINDER of the line
up should be much the same as
that which opened against the
Huskies.
CURTICE has given no indica
tion that he will discontinue his
“troika” system of rotating quar
terbacks. Off his performance
against the Huskies, sophomore
Steve Thurlow will probably got
the starting call. Rod Sears and
Chuck Butler,will alternate with
him unless one of the three should
click.


KEN BABAJIAN, CARD FULLBACK, returns to the grid wars Saturday
afternoon against UCLA. The 5-8, 190-pound scrapper was side
lined last week with a hip pointer, but has been working out with
the team this week and should be ready to go against the Bruins.
The Cards will need the hard-hitting Babajian, for Hal Steuber is
out with a broken jaw. Game time is 1:30 p.m.

KEN BABAJIAN, CARD FULLBACK, returns to the grid wars Saturday
afternoon against UCLA. The 5-8, 190-pound scrapper was side
lined last week with a hip pointer, but has been working out with
the team this week and should be ready to go against the Bruins.
The Cards will need the hard-hitting Babajian, for Hal Steuber is
out with a broken jaw. Game time is 1:30 p.m.
After a discouraging 13-0 loss in
its Big Five opener, Stanford’s
varsity football team is working
harder than ever to prepare for
the powerful UCLA Bruins. The
Indians host the Southlanders in
the Stadium Saturday.

Coach Jack Curtice has put his
charges through a series of work
outs that have been longer than
any on the Farm for the past few
years. After last week’s showing
against Washington, the Cards
have been concentrating on de
fense.
THE BRUINS own the AAWIJ’s
most productive ground attack,
averaging 228 yards per game. In
Bob Smith and Mike Haffner they
have the two leading rushers.
The Cards front line has had
little trouble stopping anything
coming over (he middle, hut lacks
the overall speed to cover on
•sweeps.
Curtice had another dose of bad
news this week when he learned
that Al Hildebrand, who started
at tackle for the Cards in Seattle,
will be sidelined with an injured
foot.
THIS CUTS the Tribe's tackle
corps to just three w'ho have any
game experience. C. B. Simons
and Frank Atkinson probably will
get the call with Randy Vahan
waiting in the wings.
Hard-running Ken Babajian will
return to the lineup after missing
a week with a hip point. The little
sophomore who stand only 5-8 but
weighs 190, has been called by his
coach the best running fullback
on the squad. Babajian probably
will not get the starting assign
ment though, since Ed Cummings
has been looking good on defense.
THE REMAINDER of the line
up should be much the same as
that which opened against the
Huskies.
CURTICE has given no indica
tion that he will discontinue his
“troika” system of rotating quar
terbacks. Off his performance
against the Huskies, sophomore
Steve Thurlow will probably got
the starting call. Rod Sears and
Chuck Butler,will alternate with
him unless one of the three should
click.
