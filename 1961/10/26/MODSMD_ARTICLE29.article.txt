# Bears Test Baltimore
## 
### 
CHICAGO (UPD— George Hal
as, owner-coach of the Chicago
Bears to whom every Sunday is
doomsday, ranged yesterday be
tween pride and despair.
He was proud because of the
job the Bears did against San
Francisco’s vaunted “shotgun” of
fense last week, but despairing
because “it’ll be tougher playing
Baltimore this week because they
use both the shotgun and the T.”
The Bears got a schedule break
in that they were able to try out
their defenses for these same two
foes.
Two weeks ago Baltimore un
veiled a “shotgun” run by Johnny
Unitas and the Bears contained it
well enough to win.
The brief testing showed the
way toward setting up defenses
which worked so well against the
San Francisco “shotgun” that the
Forty-Niners gained only 132
yards.
