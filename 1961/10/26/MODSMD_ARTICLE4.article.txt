### BILL REPPY 
Candidates for freshman presi
dent and vice president and Roble
LASSU representative will be in
troduced at 7 tonight at Roble, ac
cording to Bob Gates, rally chair
man of the ASSU Elections Com
mission.
Tomorrow night at 7:30 head
yell leader candidates will address
the rally crowd at Frost Amphi
theatre.
On Saturday all nine will appear
during the UCLA game and lead
a yell.
Warren Greeley of Cedro has
withdrawn as a candidate for
Class of ’65 vice presidency, re
ducing to 15 the field in that race.
AKL Dave Kiesel has asked
Elections Commission to with
draw his name from the ballot as
a candidate for head yell leader in
the primary elections Nov. 1-2.

Ward Mac Donald is seeking re
election as LASSU representative
from the Graduate Schools of Min

eral Sciences not the School of
Mineral Sciences alone as reported
previously. Thus incumbent
Charles Lofgren is a candidate for
LASSU representative for the
Graduate School of Humanities
only.
Students in both the Graduate
Schools of Mineral Science and
Humanities and Mineral Sciences
vote for candidates from both di
visions but must elect one from
each.

The Daily yesterday contacted
Gracie Daniels—the only woman
in the race for head yell leader—
to get her reaction to running
against five fraternity men, a
vampire, a deported wet-back, and
a ball.

“I’m surprised and happy to be
up against so many good men,”
she said, “I'm sticking with my
campaign. It will be subtle, but
won’t drop to the level of the

gross.”
Gracie assured The Daily she
planned to speak at Frost at to
morrow night’s rally.
