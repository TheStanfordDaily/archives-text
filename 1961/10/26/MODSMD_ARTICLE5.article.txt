# Stanford Students Participate In African University Activity

In marked contrast to Peace
Corps member Margery Michel
more’s “Dear Bobbo” reaction to
African life are the reactions of
the Stanford students studying at
Makerere College in Uganda.
“What a pleasant surprise Ma
kerere was,” writes Hilary Sims,
who left for East Africa after
her graduation from Stanford
last June. “Africa is an exciting
place. There is so much to be
done, so much room for creative
work. There are problems and
inconveniences, and the weather
isn’t always pleasant, but there
is also an air of progress and
change: and it is a challenge.”
HIi.ARV is studying at Makc
rere on a unique student ex
change program arranged by the
lIR-Africa desk. The exchange
has brought Epafuladito Kiwa
nuka, a Makerere student, here
to study political science.
Other Stanford students at Ma
kerere are Rich Hawkins, Rich
ard Kimball and Joan Hoffman,
who are preparing for teaching
jobs in Africa on the ICA-spon
sored “Teachers for East Africa”
program. They are among the 157
Americans at Makerere, a group
which “has made a very favor
able impact on the college com
munity, despite advanced suspi
cions to the contrary,” Hilary re
ports.
Rich Kimball, a Class of ’6l
engineering student, urges Amer
ican-7 lo come to Afric a, comment

ing that the people of East Africa
“crave knowledge of America and
of the world in general.”
HE FURTHER states that that
there is no “color-bar” in Uganda.
“If you are sincerely interested
in a people, there cannot be any
resentment to “white” as there is
no color differentiation aware
ness.”

Both Hilary and Rich were im
pressed by the intense emphasis
on “uhuru” (freedom) of the Ma
kerere students. “Uhuru na Ken
ya! ta”—freedom with Kenyatta
was plastered across placards car
ried by students parading through
town when Man Mau leader Ken
ya! ta was released from English
custody.
“Kenyatta, cha cha, cha” was
c haul e d continuously for five
hours “at the wildest, gayest
dance I have ever been to,” Hil
ary reports. The chant could "be
heard for miles, as faculty and
students, all races, flung them
selves into the fervor of the
event.”

HOWEVER, Makerere is no
party school. Hilary emphasizes
the decided academic emphasis,
especially among the final-year
students, who must pass a com
prehensive exam in order to grad
uate. The importance attached to
passing the final exam “leads stu
dents to accept readily the profes
sor’s word as sufficient and to be
wary of offending those who will
have a hand in grading the exam.’’
Graduation brings problems,
however, and Hilary mentions

that students are intensely aware
of the conflicts they will face.
One problem for a graduate
comes when he returns to his
village and is faced with the con
flicting views of his father and
clan.

A SECOND source of conflict
arises from the great need for
educated people in Africa. Be
cause their knowledge and ability
is needed in every facet of Amer
ican life, Makerere students must
choose between private industry’s
tempting high wages and the pa
triotic appeals of their govern
ments. “Most students are well
aware that they will be put into
positions of responsibility in their
respective governments immedi
ately upon graduation,” Hilary
writes.

Despite the need for educated
Africans, Hilary reports that Ma
kerere has fifty Vacant places.
The vacancies are caused by the
academic standards of Makerere
which are so high that some stu
dents who have failed to qualify
for Makerere have gone on suc
cessfully to higher education in
the United States and England.
The awareness of the Makerere
students that (hey are playing an
important part in shaping a new
culture “contributes” to the gen
erally electric atmosphere of the
campus despite the enervating
climate and pace of life. When
Tanganyika gets its independence
on December 9, the first East
African territory to do so, the
place should explode with enthus
iasm.”

EPAFULADITO (PAFLA) KIWANUKA from Uganda discusses study
in Africa with Roble girls as Rich Van Horn looks on. Similar dis
cussions will take place tonight at Lassen House in Stern, Arroyo
in Wilbur and Union Residence. Pafla is here as a result of an ex
change which enabled Hilary Sims to study at Mekerere College
(see story at left).
