# Work on Project M To Start in January At Sand Hill Site
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Amid the ominous rumble of
hydrogen bombs in Siberia, a
more fruitful nuclear development
is about to commence in the roll
ing hills behind Stanford Univer
sity.

After almost six years of study
and preparation, construction on
Project M, the two-mile linear ac
celerator, will begin on a site west
of the Farm near Sand Hill Road
and the proposed freeway, in Jan
uary 1962.

Although congressional approv
al of the project, given last month
in the form of a $ll4 million ap
propriation, had been slowed for
a number of political reasons,
there was never serious doubt that
it eventually would be endorsed.

IT HAS HAD the solid backing
of scientists and government of
ficials since study of such a mon
ster machine began in 1956. With
the higher energy provided by the
machine, initially 10 BEV (Billion
Electron Volts) with a maximum
capacity of 45 BEV, man would be
able to probe deeper into the
atom and the nature of matter
than ever before.

That Stanford would get the
project was almost assured. Last
year the AEC declared that Stan
ford possessed the only scientific
team in the nation with enough
know how to operate the linear ac
celerator, attesting to the Univer
sity’s pioneer work in linear ac
celeration.

The two-mile “monster” will es
sentially be a giant, advanced
model of the 310-foot Mark 111 ac
celerator now operated by the
Physics Department. This experi
ence was the important factor in
proposing the Stanford site.

PROF. W. K. H. Panofsky, direc
tor of the High Energy Physics
Laboratory where the Mark 111 is
located, and Prof. Edward L. Ginz
ton. head of the Microwave Labor
atory. are in charge of the project,
which will be academically inte
grated with the University. Prof.
Panofsky says, “We are confident
that the project can be combined
successfully with the primary
functions of the University in
teaching and research.
In fact, we believe that the close

relationship between regular Uni
versity faculty and students and
the staff of the accelerator project
will bo of great value to both.”

The accelerator itself will con
sist primarily of a 10,000-foot cop
per tube about four inches in di
ameter. The tube will bo con
structed in 1,000 ten-foot sections,
each of which will be composed of
about 100 cylindrical rings separ
ated by disks. Each disk will have
a one-inch hole in its center.

THE ENTIRE assemblage will
look something like 100,000 tuna
fish cans, welded end to end.

This long tube will be buried
35 feet underground tsee cut).
Along its entire length will be
built a klystron gallery which will
house 240, and later 1,000, multi
million-watt klystron power tubes
which will supply the energy, in
the form of electromagnetic
waves, necessary to push the elec
trons closer and closer to the
speed of light.

As the klystron’s electromag
netic wave travels along the cop
per tubing, the electrons “ride”
them, much as a surfboard rider
“rides” ocean waves. Actually, the
electrons reach 99 per cent of the
speed of light in the first few feet,
and the purpose of the added
length is to give them more ener
gy. This will be in the form of
mass, since according to Einstein,
the electrons can never quite
reach the speed of light.

THE STREAM OF electrons
will be channeled into one of two
target buildings equipped to run
various experiments which will
hopefully result in a clearer pic
ture of the atom, a greater under
standing of the forces which hold
the atom together, and perhaps
the discovery of new atomic par
ticles.

Close by will be shops, labs and
administration buildings.

Construction of the various
buildings will begin in January
and should be completed by 1963,
when construction of the acceler
ator and klystron gallery will be
gin. The entire complex should be
finished by 1966, although it will
take about nine months longer to
put the accelerator into full oper
ation.
