# McCarthy: Soph Reps Necessary
## 
### BILL REPPY 
Class of ’64 president John Mc-
Carthy yesterday urged voters to
approve the proposed ASSU con
stitutional amendment ensuring
sophomore representation on Leg
islature.
Sophomore representatives, he
said, would give members of their
class much closer contacts to
LASSU and its issues. “It would
strengthen Legislature, too.”
If the amendment is passed, he
explained, by-laws would be
drawn up creating two LASSU
representatives, a woman and a
man, representing the sophomore
class at large.
A 2/3 VOTE is necessary to ap
prove constitutional amendments.
The issue will come before voters
at the primary elections, Nov. 1-2.
Opponents to the amendment
state they are against having
LASSU representatives by class
since the existing representatives
are chosen by living group and
residence districts, McCarthy said.

“GRADUATE SCHOOL repre
sentatives are not elected by liv
ing group but by department,” he
continued. “Furthermore, the
members of LASSU represent
groups so large that they must
act as individuals rather than di
rect expression of those groups
which they represent.
“The key to electing members
to LASSU is picking men and
women who have views similar to
your own,” he continued.
“Sophomores have particular
group opinions since they have
just moved out of freshman dorms
into new residences. These views
must be represented in Legisla
ture.”

McCarthy said he had yet to
hear an effective argument
against the amendment.
