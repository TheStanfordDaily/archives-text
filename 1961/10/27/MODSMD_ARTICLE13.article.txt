# CAMPUS OPINION
## Head Sponsor Asks for Fairness, Accuracy 
### JERRY PUTTLER 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This article
was submitted to The Daily as an
open letter to the University com
munity and to the Stanford fresh
men by tlie head sponsor at Wil
bur Hall.)

As the result of two unfor
tunate incidents and the com
ments these incidents have
prompted in The Daily and else
where, the freshman program at
Stanford is under attack.
The problems are real and need
not be glossed over, but the ap
proach which has been taken to
the problems thus far has en
gendered a good deal of misun
derstanding; the picture has been
distorted, and to regain the prop
er perspective will not be easy.
Yet simply because of the sen
sational nature of the incidents
and the reaction they have pro
duced, it is particularly important
that the situation be viewed fair
ly and accurately.
TO THE STANFORD freshmen
we say this: most of you are
presently experiencing Tnure per
sonal freedom than you have had
at any previous time. The Univer
sity considers this a part of your
total educational experience and
expects from you the wise exor
cise of this freedom, for personal
freedom implicitly requires per
sonal responsibility.
This is the essence of the fresh
man program at Stanford: to fa
cilitate your assumption of this
responsibility within the academic
community. It is to this goal that
the freshman sponsors are com
mitted, and the success of the
freshman program is measured
largely in these terms.
(The sponsor program should
not be judged—as it has been by
some—by remarks attributed to
a sponsor in Brent Galyean’s let
ter published in The Daily last
Monday. The meeting mentioned

was not a freshman meeting, and
it did not occur in any of the
Wilbur Houses. The statements
to which the letter referred were
not made by a sponsor and do
not represent views in accord with
the freshman program.)

IN REGARD TO the freshman
men and their response last Mon
day night to the full moon and
senior tradition on Quad, personal
responsibility obviously was not
assumed. Certain facts are clear:
a large group of freshman men
(approximating 150) were present
on Quad, and the activities of
many individuals were inexcus
able.

The overwhelming response of
freshman men this year over past
years is due to many things,
among them the article in The
Daily on Monday morning which
freshmen have said they consid
ered an invitation to uphold what
seemed to be their half of the
tradition: the waterbag.
The Civ test that morning un
doubtedly assisted the effort and
Monday night was a good time to
let off steam. And—not to shift
the blame—the Wilbur sponsors
bear part of the responsibility in
not defining the situation more
clearly to the freshmen.
BUT TO CONSTItCl'T'"t ho Mon
day night situation as something
organized and condoned by the
sponsors could not be farther
from the truth. We are as sorry
the situation developed as is the
rest of the University.
There is more to the picture
than this, however. Bill Griffin’s
Campus Opinion article, although
basically accurate, greatly over
states the situation. The really un
fortunate incidents of Monday
night were the result of the ac
tions of only a few individuals—
the small minority.
Most of the freshman men there
did little more than what every
one would class as “good clean
fun”—threw a few water balloons
and went home. Most of them did
not even know of the unfortunate
incidents of the evening until
reading about them in The Daily
Wednesday morning.
ALU OF WHICH is not to say
even that the actions of the ma
jority were excusable; the situa
tion as it developed got out of
hand and all who were there bear
part of the blame.
The point is that in all that has
been said and done there have
been several ai’eas of irresponsi
bility surrounding all of -the
events of the past week. The first,
of course, is that of those par
ticipating. A second is that of
those observing the participants,
and a third concerns the way in
which the incidents were commu
nicated to the rest of the Universi
ty afterwards.
Finally, the rest of the Universi
ty boars a certain responsibility
in the way in which it reacts to
what has happened. In all of these
areas there has been a breakdown
of responsibility.

A PORTION OF the University
community has jumped to unwar
ranted conclusions. The statement
made in a letter in Thursday’s
Daily concerning “the general im
maturity which has always made
Wilbur the most unpleasant place
on campus in which to live”—l
would hope is not the case.
We endeavor at Wilbur to trans
mit to the freshmen a realization
of the expectations, demands, and
opportunities of the University
and to elicit a response with intel
ligence, responsibility and maturi
ty.
We join with the faculty and the
rest of the student body in seek
ing these goals.
LET US attempt to build wher
ever we can, learn from our ex
periences, and profit from our
mistakes. The freshman men are
anxious to do so. The responsi
bility for mature conduct lies per
sonally with each individual. Poor
judgment on the part of others
does not absolve us of the respon
sibilities of educated behavior.

As the result of two unfor
tunate incidents and the com
ments these incidents have
prompted in The Daily and else
where, the freshman program at
Stanford is under attack.
The problems are real and need
not be glossed over, but the ap
proach which has been taken to
the problems thus far has en
gendered a good deal of misun
derstanding; the picture has been
distorted, and to regain the prop
er perspective will not be easy.
Yet simply because of the sen
sational nature of the incidents
and the reaction they have pro
duced, it is particularly important
that the situation be viewed fair
ly and accurately.
TO THE STANFORD freshmen
we say this: most of you are
presently experiencing Tnure per
sonal freedom than you have had
at any previous time. The Univer
sity considers this a part of your
total educational experience and
expects from you the wise exor
cise of this freedom, for personal
freedom implicitly requires per
sonal responsibility.
This is the essence of the fresh
man program at Stanford: to fa
cilitate your assumption of this
responsibility within the academic
community. It is to this goal that
the freshman sponsors are com
mitted, and the success of the
freshman program is measured
largely in these terms.
(The sponsor program should
not be judged—as it has been by
some—by remarks attributed to
a sponsor in Brent Galyean’s let
ter published in The Daily last
Monday. The meeting mentioned

was not a freshman meeting, and
it did not occur in any of the
Wilbur Houses. The statements
to which the letter referred were
not made by a sponsor and do
not represent views in accord with
the freshman program.)

IN REGARD TO the freshman
men and their response last Mon
day night to the full moon and
senior tradition on Quad, personal
responsibility obviously was not
assumed. Certain facts are clear:
a large group of freshman men
(approximating 150) were present
on Quad, and the activities of
many individuals were inexcus
able.

The overwhelming response of
freshman men this year over past
years is due to many things,
among them the article in The
Daily on Monday morning which
freshmen have said they consid
ered an invitation to uphold what
seemed to be their half of the
tradition: the waterbag.
The Civ test that morning un
doubtedly assisted the effort and
Monday night was a good time to
let off steam. And—not to shift
the blame—the Wilbur sponsors
bear part of the responsibility in
not defining the situation more
clearly to the freshmen.
BUT TO CONSTItCl'T'"t ho Mon
day night situation as something
organized and condoned by the
sponsors could not be farther
from the truth. We are as sorry
the situation developed as is the
rest of the University.
There is more to the picture
than this, however. Bill Griffin’s
Campus Opinion article, although
basically accurate, greatly over
states the situation. The really un
fortunate incidents of Monday
night were the result of the ac
tions of only a few individuals—
the small minority.
Most of the freshman men there
did little more than what every
one would class as “good clean
fun”—threw a few water balloons
and went home. Most of them did
not even know of the unfortunate
incidents of the evening until
reading about them in The Daily
Wednesday morning.
ALU OF WHICH is not to say
even that the actions of the ma
jority were excusable; the situa
tion as it developed got out of
hand and all who were there bear
part of the blame.
The point is that in all that has
been said and done there have
been several ai’eas of irresponsi
bility surrounding all of -the
events of the past week. The first,
of course, is that of those par
ticipating. A second is that of
those observing the participants,
and a third concerns the way in
which the incidents were commu
nicated to the rest of the Universi
ty afterwards.
Finally, the rest of the Universi
ty boars a certain responsibility
in the way in which it reacts to
what has happened. In all of these
areas there has been a breakdown
of responsibility.

A PORTION OF the University
community has jumped to unwar
ranted conclusions. The statement
made in a letter in Thursday’s
Daily concerning “the general im
maturity which has always made
Wilbur the most unpleasant place
on campus in which to live”—l
would hope is not the case.
We endeavor at Wilbur to trans
mit to the freshmen a realization
of the expectations, demands, and
opportunities of the University
and to elicit a response with intel
ligence, responsibility and maturi
ty.
We join with the faculty and the
rest of the student body in seek
ing these goals.
LET US attempt to build wher
ever we can, learn from our ex
periences, and profit from our
mistakes. The freshman men are
anxious to do so. The responsi
bility for mature conduct lies per
sonally with each individual. Poor
judgment on the part of others
does not absolve us of the respon

As the result of two unfor
tunate incidents and the com
ments these incidents have
prompted in The Daily and else
where, the freshman program at
Stanford is under attack.
The problems are real and need
not be glossed over, but the ap
proach which has been taken to
the problems thus far has en
gendered a good deal of misun
derstanding; the picture has been
distorted, and to regain the prop
er perspective will not be easy.
Yet simply because of the sen
sational nature of the incidents
and the reaction they have pro
duced, it is particularly important
that the situation be viewed fair
ly and accurately.
TO THE STANFORD freshmen
we say this: most of you are
presently experiencing Tnure per
sonal freedom than you have had
at any previous time. The Univer
sity considers this a part of your
total educational experience and
expects from you the wise exor
cise of this freedom, for personal
freedom implicitly requires per
sonal responsibility.
This is the essence of the fresh
man program at Stanford: to fa
cilitate your assumption of this
responsibility within the academic
community. It is to this goal that
the freshman sponsors are com
mitted, and the success of the
freshman program is measured
largely in these terms.
(The sponsor program should
not be judged—as it has been by
some—by remarks attributed to
a sponsor in Brent Galyean’s let
ter published in The Daily last
Monday. The meeting mentioned

was not a freshman meeting, and
it did not occur in any of the
Wilbur Houses. The statements
to which the letter referred were
not made by a sponsor and do
not represent views in accord with
the freshman program.)

IN REGARD TO the freshman
men and their response last Mon
day night to the full moon and
senior tradition on Quad, personal
responsibility obviously was not
assumed. Certain facts are clear:
a large group of freshman men
(approximating 150) were present
on Quad, and the activities of
many individuals were inexcus
able.

The overwhelming response of
freshman men this year over past
years is due to many things,
among them the article in The
Daily on Monday morning which
freshmen have said they consid
ered an invitation to uphold what
seemed to be their half of the
tradition: the waterbag.
The Civ test that morning un
doubtedly assisted the effort and
Monday night was a good time to
let off steam. And—not to shift
the blame—the Wilbur sponsors
bear part of the responsibility in
not defining the situation more
clearly to the freshmen.
BUT TO CONSTItCl'T'"t ho Mon
day night situation as something
organized and condoned by the
sponsors could not be farther
from the truth. We are as sorry
the situation developed as is the
rest of the University.
There is more to the picture
than this, however. Bill Griffin’s
Campus Opinion article, although
basically accurate, greatly over
states the situation. The really un
fortunate incidents of Monday
night were the result of the ac
tions of only a few individuals—
the small minority.
Most of the freshman men there
did little more than what every
one would class as “good clean
fun”—threw a few water balloons
and went home. Most of them did
not even know of the unfortunate
incidents of the evening until
reading about them in The Daily
Wednesday morning.
ALU OF WHICH is not to say
even that the actions of the ma
jority were excusable; the situa
tion as it developed got out of
hand and all who were there bear
part of the blame.
The point is that in all that has
been said and done there have
been several ai’eas of irresponsi
bility surrounding all of -the
events of the past week. The first,
of course, is that of those par
ticipating. A second is that of
those observing the participants,
and a third concerns the way in
which the incidents were commu
nicated to the rest of the Universi
ty afterwards.
Finally, the rest of the Universi
ty boars a certain responsibility
in the way in which it reacts to
what has happened. In all of these
areas there has been a breakdown
of responsibility.

A PORTION OF the University
community has jumped to unwar
ranted conclusions. The statement
made in a letter in Thursday’s
Daily concerning “the general im
maturity which has always made
Wilbur the most unpleasant place
on campus in which to live”—l
would hope is not the case.
We endeavor at Wilbur to trans
mit to the freshmen a realization
of the expectations, demands, and
opportunities of the University
and to elicit a response with intel
ligence, responsibility and maturi
ty.
We join with the faculty and the
rest of the student body in seek
ing these goals.
