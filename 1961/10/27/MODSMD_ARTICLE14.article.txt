STANFORD-AT HARVARD
Editor, The Daily:
From our foreign correspondent
stationed in Palo Alto we have re
ceived word that The Daily has
been in communication with the
newest of the Stanford campi,
Stanford-at-Harvard.
As with many noble Stanford
institutions (the Chappie, Ros
sot’s), Stanford-on-the-Char!es has
a ladies’ auxiliary. The auxiliary
has been hard at work mingling
with the natives, following their
pursuits, and speaking their lan
guage.
We have investigated possible
Beat-Cal banner moorings, and
find that the only structure of ap
propriate height is the Harvard
Chapel steeple.
Also we nave stood with tin
cups in Harvard Square on suc
cessive Saturday midnights, col
lecting for PACE.
Although the natives do not
allow us to enter their library, we
feel that we now qualify for full
accreditation with Dr. Walker’s
office. Should you demand further
proof of our efforts we will bo
happy to send you a green book
bag full of MTA tokens, an offi
cial program from the Charles
River Submarine Races, and a
dictionary of common ethnic
phrases.
