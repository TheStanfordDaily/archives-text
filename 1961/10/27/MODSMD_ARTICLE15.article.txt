## New Hollywood Smash-'Story of Jack and Jill' 
### ALAN ROSENTHAL 
OK boys . . . we got it. Wow,
what a story. Paid a couple of
million but worth every green
back. And it’s presold. Jeez. Think
of it. One hundred-eighty million
just thirsting for our product.

We’ll get Picasso for the post
ers. Let’s see. “You thrilled to it
night after tense night in your
cradle .. . now blazing a new path
in motion picture history . . . only
MCG has the courage and auda
city to present the blazing tor
rendous story of teenage passion
in a hostile world.”

With modest pride wo give you
“The Story of Jack and Jill.”
OK. Open on this Madison Ave
nue-looking guy in the president’s
chair. Dolly in. Spiel on the film’s
importance. Credits to the Ameri
can Army, Navy and Junior
Mickey Mice societies.
I TAKE IT you all know the
story? Good. Well we gotta give it
angle, poignancy. Now take Jack.
All American boy . . . mother in
the A.A., dad carrying on with the
maid, sister psychopath, kid
brother a teenage were-wolf . . .

you know, average American
family, the audience have gotta
identify.
Meets this chick. Average
American girl (can we get Anita
Ekberg?). They click when they
both find they flunked out of
English Comp. I.
In church (that’ll get the DAR
on ouf side) he tells her of his
ideals. Plans to make a million on
atom bomb shelters. (You know,
unsatisfied customers never come
back.) She digs it. Thinks it’s
pretty noble. Then I think a dream
sequence, Harry. What do you
say?

BUT THE chick tells her prof.
Intellectual type. Red sympa
thizer. Refuses to get crew cuts.
He’s of course in love with the
babe. Out of spite flunks Jack.
Gets him drafted.

Cut. Now we have this great
battle scene, cast of millions. At
the end Jack struggles to the top
of the hill carrying pail of water
for dying comrade. Jeez, we can
play it for symbolism.
Water. The baptismal act.
Searchlights in the sky making
the cross. (Can we get Bergman
for this sequence, Harry?) Jack
gets it in the head. Taken to field
hospital.
MEANWHILE back home Jill
escapes seduction from the prof,
who turns over new leaf, joins
Birch Society and confesses all.
Jill goes to Europe.
With difficulty preserves vir
ginity in England, France and
Spain. Thinks of becoming a nun.
Slips whilst climbing at St. Pe
ters. Taken to the same hospital
as Jack. Brought together by this
tap-dancing priest—Fred Astaire,
maybe. Clinch. Now he can go
back to making bombs for a bet
ter world. Fade out on celestial
choir.

OF COURSE IT’S really a song
and dance picture. We’ve got this
new boy Kafka to give us some
great numbers, especially where
Jack’s sister (Eartha Kitt) comes
in wearing the worm’s outfit and
sings “Boy, was I bugged last
night.” Should be a golden disc.
We’ll use Danny for humor.
He’s the all-American schlomp
with the heart of gold. Horace E.
Dip Rex. He’s got a line about
knocking off his dad that’ll mur
der you. We’ve given him two of
the best songs. “You look just
like my ma,” and “I wanna girl
just like the girl that married
dear old dad.”
We’ll have to throw in some
rapings, violence and incest but
if half the dialogue is in French
they’ll think it’s Nouvelle Vogue
ana we can get past the censors.

WHAT ELSE? Some flash
backs, sure. Internal monologue.
Right, that’ll bring the intellec
tuals. And if we get Moss Hart
and Bertrand Russell in the script
then we should please everyone.
OK, have we missed anything,
Harry? Wow! you’re right boy.
Charlton Heston as God!

Jack’s sister (Eartha Kitt) comes
in wearing the worm’s outfit and
sings “Boy, was I bugged last
night.” Should be a golden disc.
We’ll use Danny for humor.
He’s the all-American schlomp
with the heart of gold. Horace E.
Dip Rex. He’s got a line about
knocking off his dad that’ll mur
der you. We’ve given him two of
the best songs. “You look just
like my ma,” and “I wanna girl
just like the girl that married
dear old dad.”
We’ll have to throw in some
rapings, violence and incest but
if half the dialogue is in French
they’ll think it’s Nouvelle Vogue
ana we can get past the censors.

WHAT ELSE? Some flash
backs, sure. Internal monologue.
Right, that’ll bring the intellec
tuals. And if we get Moss Hart
and Bertrand Russell in the script
then we should please everyone.
OK, have we missed anything,
Harry? Wow! you’re right boy.
Charlton Heston as God!
OK boys . . . we got it. Wow,
what a story. Paid a couple of
million but worth every green
back. And it’s presold. Jeez. Think
of it. One hundred-eighty million
just thirsting for our product.

We’ll get Picasso for the post
ers. Let’s see. “You thrilled to it
night after tense night in your
cradle .. . now blazing a new path
in motion picture history . . . only
MCG has the courage and auda
city to present the blazing tor
rendous story of teenage passion
in a hostile world.”

With modest pride wo give you
“The Story of Jack and Jill.”
OK. Open on this Madison Ave
nue-looking guy in the president’s
chair. Dolly in. Spiel on the film’s
importance. Credits to the Ameri
can Army, Navy and Junior
Mickey Mice societies.
I TAKE IT you all know the
story? Good. Well we gotta give it
angle, poignancy. Now take Jack.
All American boy . . . mother in
the A.A., dad carrying on with the
maid, sister psychopath, kid
brother a teenage were-wolf . . .

you know, average American
family, the audience have gotta
identify.
Meets this chick. Average
American girl (can we get Anita
Ekberg?). They click when they
both find they flunked out of
English Comp. I.
In church (that’ll get the DAR
on ouf side) he tells her of his
ideals. Plans to make a million on
atom bomb shelters. (You know,
unsatisfied customers never come
back.) She digs it. Thinks it’s
pretty noble. Then I think a dream
sequence, Harry. What do you
say?

BUT THE chick tells her prof.
Intellectual type. Red sympa
thizer. Refuses to get crew cuts.
He’s of course in love with the
babe. Out of spite flunks Jack.
Gets him drafted.

Cut. Now we have this great
battle scene, cast of millions. At
the end Jack struggles to the top
of the hill carrying pail of water
for dying comrade. Jeez, we can
play it for symbolism.
Water. The baptismal act.
Searchlights in the sky making
the cross. (Can we get Bergman
for this sequence, Harry?) Jack
gets it in the head. Taken to field
hospital.
MEANWHILE back home Jill
escapes seduction from the prof,
who turns over new leaf, joins
Birch Society and confesses all.
Jill goes to Europe.
With difficulty preserves vir
ginity in England, France and
Spain. Thinks of becoming a nun.
Slips whilst climbing at St. Pe
ters. Taken to the same hospital
as Jack. Brought together by this
tap-dancing priest—Fred Astaire,
maybe. Clinch. Now he can go
back to making bombs for a bet
ter world. Fade out on celestial
choir.

OF COURSE IT’S really a song
and dance picture. We’ve got this
new boy Kafka to give us some
great numbers, especially where
Jack’s sister (Eartha Kitt) comes
in wearing the worm’s outfit and

the end Jack struggles to the top
of the hill carrying pail of water
for dying comrade. Jeez, we can
play it for symbolism.
Water. The baptismal act.
Searchlights in the sky making
the cross. (Can we get Bergman
for this sequence, Harry?) Jack
gets it in the head. Taken to field
hospital.
MEANWHILE back home Jill
escapes seduction from the prof,
who turns over new leaf, joins
Birch Society and confesses all.
Jill goes to Europe.
With difficulty preserves vir
ginity in England, France and
Spain. Thinks of becoming a nun.
Slips whilst climbing at St. Pe
ters. Taken to the same hospital
as Jack. Brought together by this
tap-dancing priest—Fred Astaire,
maybe. Clinch. Now he can go
back to making bombs for a bet
ter world. Fade out on celestial
choir.

OF COURSE IT’S really a song
and dance picture. We’ve got this
new boy Kafka to give us some
great numbers, especially where
Jack’s sister (Eartha Kitt) comes
in wearing the worm’s outfit and
sings “Boy, was I bugged last
night.” Should be a golden disc.
We’ll use Danny for humor.
He’s the all-American schlomp
with the heart of gold. Horace E.
Dip Rex. He’s got a line about
knocking off his dad that’ll mur
der you. We’ve given him two of
the best songs. “You look just
like my ma,” and “I wanna girl
just like the girl that married
dear old dad.”
We’ll have to throw in some
rapings, violence and incest but
if half the dialogue is in French
they’ll think it’s Nouvelle Vogue
ana we can get past the censors.

WHAT ELSE? Some flash
backs, sure. Internal monologue.
Right, that’ll bring the intellec
tuals. And if we get Moss Hart
and Bertrand Russell in the script
then we should please everyone.
OK, have we missed anything,
Harry? Wow! you’re right boy.
Charlton Heston as God!
OK boys . . . we got it. Wow,
what a story. Paid a couple of
million but worth every green
back. And it’s presold. Jeez. Think
of it. One hundred-eighty million
just thirsting for our product.

We’ll get Picasso for the post
ers. Let’s see. “You thrilled to it
night after tense night in your
cradle .. . now blazing a new path
in motion picture history . . . only
MCG has the courage and auda
city to present the blazing tor
rendous story of teenage passion
in a hostile world.”

With modest pride wo give you
“The Story of Jack and Jill.”
OK. Open on this Madison Ave
nue-looking guy in the president’s
chair. Dolly in. Spiel on the film’s
importance. Credits to the Ameri
can Army, Navy and Junior
Mickey Mice societies.
I TAKE IT you all know the
story? Good. Well we gotta give it
angle, poignancy. Now take Jack.
All American boy . . . mother in
the A.A., dad carrying on with the
maid, sister psychopath, kid
brother a teenage were-wolf . . .

you know, average American
family, the audience have gotta
identify.
Meets this chick. Average
American girl (can we get Anita
Ekberg?). They click when they
both find they flunked out of
English Comp. I.
In church (that’ll get the DAR
on ouf side) he tells her of his
ideals. Plans to make a million on
atom bomb shelters. (You know,
unsatisfied customers never come
back.) She digs it. Thinks it’s
pretty noble. Then I think a dream
sequence, Harry. What do you
say?

BUT THE chick tells her prof.
Intellectual type. Red sympa
thizer. Refuses to get crew cuts.
He’s of course in love with the
babe. Out of spite flunks Jack.
Gets him drafted.
