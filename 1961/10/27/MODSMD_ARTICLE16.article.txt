FULL MOON INCIDENT
Editor, The Daily:
In the light of the past and re
cent behavior—by both word and
deed—of various individuals and
groups of the “Stanford Family,"
it seems reasonable to reflect up
on the relevance of the Stanford
Fundamental Standard to Stan
ford-in-Toto.

In the past this community
manifested a behavior most
likely by chance rather than by
choice—in accord with this con
cept. However, there is presently
an undeniable trend away from
the Standard, so that, by extra
polation, it will become a practi
cal necessity, sooner or later, to
either remove or remodel this
term.

This not only anticipates this
future condition but humbly pro
poses a solution now that will bet
ter bring theory and reality on
the Stanford scene into agree
ment.

This suggestion conciliatory
to all forces that might eventually
take up arms—is simply to re
phrase the old slogan to yield
“FUN-AMENTAL Standard.” The
first syllable of the first word
hardly needs explanation (al
though one wonders, “Fun for
whom?”), while the last three
should not require much more.
In speaking, the missing letter
is to be referred to as the silent
“D” in “fundamental”; in writing,
as the “void” between “fun” and
“amental.” Allan Fenselau

Editor, The Daily:
Representing part of the stu
dent community at Stanford, wo
feel it our duly to express regret
at Monday night’s incident on In
ner Quad. We feel that this Uni
versity suffered moral injury
when those few individuals in
volved violated standards of de
cent behavior.
The parties involved have dis
graced Stanford. As students we
do not wish to see the values ex
tended which led to violations of
human decency. We condemn the
actions themselves and call upon
the participants to consider the

gravity of their thoughtlessness
and reevaluate their responsibili
ties as Stanford students.
We only hope that these per
sons shall not fail themselves and
us again.

Editor, The Daily:
As a freshman of some maturi
ty, I, too, was appalled at the un
couth conduct of my fellow class
mates. Such obscenities and obvi
ous violations of the Fun Stan
should not go unnoticed.
These freshmen do not have the
maturity to accept the liberal
ideals of the Stanford University.
They do not, it would seem, even
have the intelligence to conduct
themselves in any but a delin
quent manner.
Since they seem to have taken
the wrong attitude toward social
tradition at Stanford, I propose
that they should be severely chas
tised. I think the fitting punish
ment would be to put not an 11
o’clock but a 10 o’clock curfew on
all freshman men, or boys as they
have shown themselves to be.
Even though I am innocent of
1 he act, I feel that I and all fresh
men should be penalized for not
stopping our classmates from
committing these atrocities. I
suggest that this penalty should
be imposed for a period of one
month, and if any more such skir

mishes occur, then it should be
extended to include the whole
quarter. Pete Steil

As a freshman of some maturi
ty, I, too, was appalled at the un
couth conduct of my fellow class
mates. Such obscenities and obvi
ous violations of the Fun Stan
should not go unnoticed.
These freshmen do not have the
maturity to accept the liberal
ideals of the Stanford University.
They do not, it would seem, even
have the intelligence to conduct
themselves in any but a delin
quent manner.
Since they seem to have taken
the wrong attitude toward social
tradition at Stanford, I propose
that they should be severely chas
tised. I think the fitting punish
ment would be to put not an 11
o’clock but a 10 o’clock curfew on
all freshman men, or boys as they
have shown themselves to be.
Even though I am innocent of
1 he act, I feel that I and all fresh
men should be penalized for not
stopping our classmates from
committing these atrocities. I
suggest that this penalty should
be imposed for a period of one
month, and if any more such skir

mishes occur, then it should be
extended to include the whole
quarter. Pete Steil

Editor, The Daily:
In the light of the past and re
cent behavior—by both word and
deed—of various individuals and
groups of the “Stanford Family,"
it seems reasonable to reflect up
on the relevance of the Stanford
Fundamental Standard to Stan
ford-in-Toto.

In the past this community
manifested a behavior most
likely by chance rather than by
choice—in accord with this con
cept. However, there is presently
an undeniable trend away from
the Standard, so that, by extra
polation, it will become a practi
cal necessity, sooner or later, to
either remove or remodel this
term.

This not only anticipates this
future condition but humbly pro
poses a solution now that will bet
ter bring theory and reality on
the Stanford scene into agree
ment.

This suggestion conciliatory
to all forces that might eventually
take up arms—is simply to re
phrase the old slogan to yield
“FUN-AMENTAL Standard.” The
first syllable of the first word
hardly needs explanation (al
though one wonders, “Fun for
whom?”), while the last three
should not require much more.
In speaking, the missing letter
is to be referred to as the silent
“D” in “fundamental”; in writing,
as the “void” between “fun” and
“amental.” Allan Fenselau
