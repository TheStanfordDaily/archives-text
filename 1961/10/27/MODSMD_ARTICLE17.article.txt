# Underdog Cards Seek Upset Against Tough UCLA Team
## Daily Sports 
### BEN TIPTON 
Stanford’s Indians will be try
ing to put the stops on (he most
power-laden offense in the Big
Five when they host the powerful
UCLA Bruins tomorrow after
noon. Game time is 1:30 p.m. in
the Stanford Stadium.
The Uclans have amassed a 228-

yard rushing average to date
W'hile matching Stanford’s 3-2 roc

ord. Making their single-wing at
tack more effective is a nearly
leakproof defense which has al
lowed only 132 ground and 230
total yards to each of their op
ponents.
The Bruin’s one offensive weak
nes is the lack of a consistent
passing attack. With running
backs like Mike Haffner, Bobby
Smith, Kermit Alexander and
Ezell Singleton around, however,
this lack hasn’t hurt them 100
much.
Stanford’s already thin reserves
were further depleted when it was
learned that tackle A1 Hildebrand
would be sidelined this weekend
with an injured foot. C. B. Simons
and Frank Atkinson will start at
tackle for the Tribe on Saturday.
The loss of Hildebrand was par
tially compensated for by the re
turn of hard-running fullback Ken
Babajian. A hip point kept the
stubb 190-pounder out of action
last week.
Also definitely returning to the
lineup will be Steve Pursell, side
lined in the Michigan State game.
Sophomore Frank Patitucci, a
standout defender, will open for
the Cards at end opposite George
Honore, however. Patitucci has
intercepted three enemy passes to
lead the Tribe in that department.
Calling the Tribe’s signals will
be senior Rod Sears.
Starting halfbacks for Stanford
will be Danny Spence and Jim
Smith, a converted quarterback.
Ed Cummings will start at full
back.

Steady center Chris Cottle and
guards Frank Dubofsky and Marv
Harris will bottle up the center of

the Indian line. Sure to see a lot
of defensive action are Gary Sar
gent, Ed Cummings and John But
ler, the Tribe’s three leading
t adders.

Just before The Daily went
to press it was learned that
blood tests will be taken of
Steve Thurlow at noon to
day to determine if lie has
mononueleosis. Thurlow miss
ed practice yesterday, and if
he does have mononucleosis
he will be out for the rest of
th<‘ season.

Five when they host the powerful
UCLA Bruins tomorrow after
noon. Game time is 1:30 p.m. in
the Stanford Stadium.
The Uclans have amassed a 228-

yard rushing average to date
W'hile matching Stanford’s 3-2 roc

ord. Making their single-wing at
tack more effective is a nearly
leakproof defense which has al
lowed only 132 ground and 230
total yards to each of their op
ponents.
The Bruin’s one offensive weak
nes is the lack of a consistent
passing attack. With running
backs like Mike Haffner, Bobby
Smith, Kermit Alexander and
Ezell Singleton around, however,
this lack hasn’t hurt them 100
much.
Stanford’s already thin reserves
were further depleted when it was
learned that tackle A1 Hildebrand
would be sidelined this weekend
with an injured foot. C. B. Simons
and Frank Atkinson will start at
tackle for the Tribe on Saturday.
The loss of Hildebrand was par
tially compensated for by the re
turn of hard-running fullback Ken
Babajian. A hip point kept the
stubb 190-pounder out of action
last week.
Also definitely returning to the
lineup will be Steve Pursell, side
lined in the Michigan State game.
Sophomore Frank Patitucci, a
standout defender, will open for
the Cards at end opposite George
Honore, however. Patitucci has
intercepted three enemy passes to
lead the Tribe in that department.
Calling the Tribe’s signals will
be senior Rod Sears.
Starting halfbacks for Stanford
will be Danny Spence and Jim
Smith, a converted quarterback.
Ed Cummings will start at full
back.

Steady center Chris Cottle and
guards Frank Dubofsky and Marv
Harris will bottle up the center of

the Indian line. Sure to see a lot
of defensive action are Gary Sar
gent, Ed Cummings and John But
ler, the Tribe’s three leading
t adders.

Just before The Daily went
to press it was learned that
blood tests will be taken of
Steve Thurlow at noon to
day to determine if lie has
mononueleosis. Thurlow miss
ed practice yesterday, and if
he does have mononucleosis
he will be out for the rest of
th<‘ season.
Stanford’s Indians will be try
ing to put the stops on (he most
power-laden offense in the Big
