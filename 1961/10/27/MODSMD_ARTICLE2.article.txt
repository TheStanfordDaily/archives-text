# Kennedy Cuts Gov't Spending
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD- Presi
dent Kennedy, faced with a $7 bil
lion federal deficit, said yesterday
he has ordered a “substantial”
cut in government spending by
slowing antirecession programs
and postponing other non-defense
projects.
Possible annual savings of $1
billion to $1.5 billion were forecast,
scattered throughout all federal
agencies conceivably including the
Defense Department. The Presi
dent said the number of govern
ment employes would be held to
the “absolute minimum” a-s the
government strives to keep out
lays in fiscal 1962 below ceilings
authorized by Congress.
Kennedy pledged anew that the
budget for fiscal 1963 will be bal
anced “barring extraordinary and
unforeseen defense require
ments.” He based his balanced
budget on a rise in revenues
stemming from economic recov
ery, not on tax increases.

The Sunday budget review is
expected to show estimated gov
ernment spending at about $B9
billion for the 12 months ending
next June 30, compared with an
ticipated receipts of slightly more
than $B2 billion.
