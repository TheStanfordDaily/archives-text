# Frosh Eleven To Host UCLA
## 
### 
The Stanford frosh football
team will face a strong, unknown
foe when the UCLA Bruins in
vade the Stanford stadium to
morrow at 10:30 a.m. Coach Dan
Stavely states that his knowledge
of the Uclan squad is scanty, but
that it probably is the best frosh
eleven around.
“They haven’t played any ma
jor teams so far. so we can’t
judge them directly,” said Stave
ly. “Cal’s strong team had a
'tough time beating USC, and
USC’s coach feels that the Tro
jans aren’t as good as the
Bruins.”
Facing UCLA in the line tomor
row will be center Stan Tartar,
guards Joe Neal and Jack Chap
pel, tackles John Wilkin and John
Wilbur, and ends Guy Rounsaville
and Bob Howard.
In the backfield will be Dick
Ragsdale at quarterback, Mor
rison Warren and Mark Rosen at
halfback, and Bob Rath at full.
UCLA will have a slight weight
advantage in the line and back
field.
