# Tribe Harriers Host Cal, UCLA
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Stanford track enthusiasts will
get their first chance tomorrow
morning to see the promising In
dian cross country squad in ac
tion, when the Card harriers take
on UCLA and Cal in a triple dual
meet.

Coach Payton Jordan has put
his youthful runners through
some long workouts since last
Saturday’s decisive beating ad
ministered by track-conscious San
Jose.

Strengthening the team for to
morrow’s run will be Rich Klier,
last year’s star, who will be back
in action for the first time after a
foot injury. Klier may not be
ready to “push it” at full speed,
but even below top form he is one
of the best runners around.

The rest of the lineup will be
the same, led by four frosh:
Weym Kirkland, Paul Schlicke,
Harlan Andrews and Dave Stine
back; along with sophomore Bill
Pratt and senior John Northway.
This is an extremely well-balanced
group, and if everybody can stick
together, the result should be a
Big Red triumph.
The Golden Bears from Berke
ley will not he sleeping, however.
Despite two straight defeats by

Stanford, Cal has been showing
steady improvement. Last week
there was a marked improvement
in the team running of the boys
from across the Bav, and with the

return to form of Englishman
John Hatton backed up by speedy
George Linn, the Bears' will be
tougher.
THE ISABV Blue harriers from
the South are a slightly unknown

quantity. Milford Dahl has ranked
with the top distance men nation
ally for several years, but the
UCLA squad as a whole is ex
pected to he not too well bal
anced.
