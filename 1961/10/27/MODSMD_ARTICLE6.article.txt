# Yugoslav Receives Nobel Letters Prize
## 
### 
The 1961 Nobel Prize for liter
ature was awarded yesterday to
the Yugoslav novelist and prewar
diplomat Ivo Andric. The prize,
worth $48,300, is the first Nobel
award ever to go to Yugoslavia.
The 69-year-old Andric’s great
est work is an historical trilogy
—“Miss.” “The Travnik Chroni
cle,” and “The Bridge on the
Drina.” It and most of his works
are about his native Bosnia and its
people.
The Royal Swedish Academy of
Letters said in its citation that
Andric was given the prize for
“the epic force with which he has
depicted themes and human des
tinies from the history of his
country.”
“NO WRITER has expressed
better the tradition and ethical
j values of the Yugoslav people.”
| commented Prof. Vladimir Dedi-
I jer of Oxford University, a friend
of Andric’s and presently visiting
lecturer at Stanford.
Although Andric’s writing is
'full of the folklore of his nation,

Dedijer believes he expresses

“certain universal ideas,” and that
the prize was awarded him for
this reason. Dedijer termed “The
Bridge on (he Drina” Andric’s
greatest novel, calling it “a chron
icle of suffering for the Serbian
people through history.”
HE NOTED that Andric con
tinually pleads for the unity of
the Yugoslav people and for mu
tual tolerance among different
religions, and feels that the com
bination of Occidental form and
Oriental poetry increases the sig
nificance of Andric’s work.

As a young man, Andric was a
member of the Young Bosnia, a
group in his native section of
Yugoslavia which fought against
Austrian rule during World War
I. For tiiis lie was sent lo prison.
Later he served in the Yugoslav
diplomatic corps until World War
11. His lasi diplomatic mission
was as minister to Berlin, and ho
returned home only a few hours
before the first Nazi bombs fell
on Belgrade.
