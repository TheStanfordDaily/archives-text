# 'Full Moon Incident' Aired at Legislature
## 
### JERKY RANKIN Editor 
Legislature last night request
er! freshman men involved in the
full moon disturbance on Quad
Monday night to comply with the
Fundamental Standard and turn
themselves in to the Freshman
Men’s Judicial Council.
After hearing an account from
several sources of what went on
during the traditional ceremony,
LASSU adopted a motion “ex
pressing confidence in the good
judgment and maturity of the
freshman class as a whole, but
profound disappointment with the

behavior of a number of fresh
men” involved in the ruckus.
It then passed, with one dis
senting vote, an amended motion
requesting those who participated
in the actual disturbance to, “in
compliance with the Fundamental
Standard,” turn themselves in to

the Freshman Men’s Judicial
Council.
THIS COUNCIL is composed of
the head Wilbur sponsor and four
senior sponsors. The motion
passed with the understanding
that the Wilbur sponsors would
explain the intent of the LASSU
motion to the freshmen so that
the frosh who were on Quad could
determine whether their part in
the incident warranted turning
themselves in.
After the meeting, LASSU grad
uate representative Ward McDon
ald said he was disturbed with
handing the case to the sponsors
to judge, as they would be likely
to be biased. The Men’s Council,
which knows little about the inci
dent, would have been a better
choice to hold a fair, impartial
hearing on the matter, he de
clared.
As originally presented by Jock
Mcßaine, administrative assistant
to ASSU President Bob Sayler,
the motion ordered the frosh
“present” on Quad to turn them
selves in to the all-University
Men’s Council.
This was amended after several
members of Legislature spoke out
against ordering all frosh who
were on Quad to appear before
Men’s Council. They said only
those who caused part of the
$99.40 worth of damage to the
Quad flower beds and a window,
or who severely frightened a Ger
man passerby, should be held ac
countable.

Puttier-declared that having the
men appear before Men’s Council
would adversely affect efforts the
frosh themselves have made since
the affair to insure that it doesn’t
reoccur.
He pointed out that at a meet
ing Wednesday night the new Wil
bur house officers had dealt with
the matter and “realize their po
sition and their . . . responsibility.
The freshman class is concerned
about” the matter, he declared.
At the meeting, he said, the
house officers decided to submit
a letter of apology to the Univer
sity community to be published in
Monday’s Daily; to wi’ite a letter
of apology to the German girl
who was disturbed: and to accept
financial responsibility for the
damage caused.
THE MATTER CAME to light
when The Daily published a col
umn Tuesday by Bill Griffin. Grif
fin was with the German girl and
her German date (both Stanford
students) when they were set up
on by a group of freshman men.
Puttier said The Daily column
was factually correct, but over
stated the case. He noted that
“very few” of the freshman men
on Quad were involved in other
than the usual water-bombing.
Puttier listed three causes of
the incident:
• An article in The Daily Mon
day morning telling of the full
moon tradition and which, he said,
gave many frosh the impression
that their role in it was to turn
out and water-bomb the seniors.
• The desire to let off steam
after the morning Western Civ
test.

• Failure of the sponsors to see
the situation developing and to
take action to head it off. “Wo
should have seen it” coming, he
explained. “We didn’t.”

the matter and “realize their po

a letter of apology to the Univer

financial responsibility for the
damage caused.
THE MATTER CAME to light
when The Daily published a col

fin was with the German girl and
her German date (both Stanford
students) when they were set up
on by a group of freshman men.
Puttier said The Daily column
was factually correct, but over
stated the case. He noted that
“very few” of the freshman men
on Quad were involved in other
than the usual water-bombing.
Puttier listed three causes of
the incident:
• An article in The Daily Mon
day morning telling of the full
moon tradition and which, he said,
gave many frosh the impression
that their role in it was to turn
out and water-bomb the seniors.
• The desire to let off steam

of apology to the German girl
who was disturbed: and to accept
financial responsibility for the
damage caused.
THE MATTER CAME to light
when The Daily published a col
umn Tuesday by Bill Griffin. Grif
fin was with the German girl and
her German date (both Stanford
students) when they were set up
on by a group of freshman men.
Puttier said The Daily column
was factually correct, but over
stated the case. He noted that
“very few” of the freshman men
on Quad were involved in other
than the usual water-bombing.
Puttier listed three causes of
the incident:
• An article in The Daily Mon
day morning telling of the full
moon tradition and which, he said,
gave many frosh the impression
that their role in it was to turn
out and water-bomb the seniors.
• The desire to let off steam
after the morning Western Civ
test.

• Failure of the sponsors to see
the situation developing and to
take action to head it off. “Wo
should have seen it” coming, he
explained. “We didn’t.”
