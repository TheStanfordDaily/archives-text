# Cal Faculty Calls Nuclear Testing 'Immoral, Criminal'
## 
### 
BERKELEY (UPIt Prof.
Lewis Mumford, regents’ visiting
professor of political science, and
20 other faculty members at the
University of California declared
yesterday that they consider nu
clear testing “immoral and a
crime.”
The faculty group in a plea re
leased Saturday asked all world
governments to stop nuclear test
ing. They also urged members of
the Berkeley campus community
to participate in a 24-hour vigil
against nuclear testing to start
at noon tomorrow on the Berke
ley campus.
At Stanford yesterqay, four
students announced plans for a
48-hour vigil on the lawn in front
of the library in protest of the
big Russian blast.
THE FOUR declared, in a let
ter on page 2 of today’s Daily,
that any students' “who would
like to join us for any part or
all of the 48 hours will bo cordi
ally welcomed.”
The four are David Quarles,
Contributing Editor of Sequoia;
Leon Haller, a graduate student in
Economics: Joel Meister, Presi
dent of the Institute of Interna
tional Relations: and Mark Mir
sky, a Wilson fellow in English.
The vigil at Berkeley is de
date for a proposed explosion of
signed to coincide with Russia’s
a 50-megaton hydrogen bomb.
“WE FEEL,” the faculty state
ment read, ‘that nuclear testing
is immoral and a crime against
living humanity and unborn gen
erations. We condemn the use of
testing as a tool of international
diplomacy and as a strengthening
of armaments.”
The protest was launched
against testing by “any and all
world governments those of
England and France; the under
ground and proposed atmospheric
tests of the United States; and
in particular, the Soviet Union’s
score or more nuclear tests in
cluding the test of a 50-megaton
bomb scheduled for Oct. 34.”
The protest vigil originally was
scheduled by SLATE, a liberal
student political organization.
But SLATE withdrew its spon
sorship Saturday of the vigil so

that the demonstration could be
held on the Berkeley campus.
University officials previously
had ordered SLATE to hold the
vigil off the campus.
C HAIKMAN Ken Cloke of
SLATE said members of the
group will now participate in the
vigil as individuals and not mem
bers of the group.
Cloke also sent a telegram to
Soviet Premier Khrushchev read
ing: “High fallout dangers are a
crime against humanity.”
