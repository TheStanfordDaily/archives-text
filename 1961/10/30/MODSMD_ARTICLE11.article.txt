# Goal Post Rushes a Dangerous Problem
## 
### 
Another near-riot ensued after Saturday’s football game as happy
UCLA students—reinforced by local kids—tore down tbo goal posts
in the Stadium. This incident was different from others in the re
cent past in that someone was hurt—ironically, a UCLA student who
was clobbered in the face and taken to the hospital.

We think the time has come for Stanford officials to take action
to eliminate what is an extremely dangerous situation.
What worries us is not so much what has happened in the past,
but what could easily occur in the future in the heat of battle when
Cal, San Jose State, USC and UCLA students visit the Farm and
urge their respective gridiron forces on to victory.
When they win, as they normally do, the visiting students natu
rally feel a desire to tear down the goal posts and take home a sou
venir. And Stanford’s student police and the Sheriff’s deputies on
hand always feel duty-bound to put up a defense. The result is a
general melee, as in this year’s UCLA game or last year’s San Jose
contest.
Tin’s defense, however, is often as leaky as the Indian line, and
as a result the goal posts come down. The danger enters as the
wave of humanity sweeps down on the goal posts. Fights break
out in all directions, and many an eye is blackened. Then the goal
posts come down, and it seems to be only a matter of time until one
will hit someone on the head—a blow which could kill a person.
And anyone who saw the students race into the stands Saturday
carrying a long section of the post in front of them like a spear, will
realize how dangerous this is, particularly when they are pursued.
It looks to us as if the makings for a full-scale riot are present
every time visiting students head for the Stanford goal posts. Solu
tions could range from not defending them to putting in concrete
posts to providing a force of policemen capable of handling the
crowd. We’re sure a solution to the problem can be found. It might
be wise to have one before Big Game.
