FORGED LETTER
Editor, The Daily:
It has been brought to my atten
tion that Pete Steil’s letter, which
appeared in last Friday’s Daily,
was, in fact, not written by Mr.
Steil.
I do not know what his views
are on the recent Quad incident
and they are not my concern here.
What does irritate me is that
someone dishonestly submitted a
letter to The Daily—presumably
to hurt Steil’s chances in the up
coming elections.
It is my understanding that
Steil was the man responsible for
organizing the half-time phone
call to the Stanford football team
when they were playing Michigan
State University.
He certainly deserves an equal
chance at winning a seat on the
student Legislature and it is my
hope that the dishonest and petty
act to which I referred above will
not prejudice his classmates
against him.
Jock Mcßaine
ASSU Administrative Assistant
Editor, The Daily:
We, the members of Soto House,
Wilbur Hall, protest the grave in
justice done to one of our mem
bers, Pete Steil. Pete is running
for LASSU representative of Wil
bur Hall, He did not write the let
ter to the editor (last Friday).
Someone, with willful intent to
hurt his chances for election,
forged Pete’s signature to this
letter, Pete is not the type of in
dividual who would suggest pun
ishment to the whole of Wilbur
for the action of a few misguided
individuals.
The writer of the letter is in vi
olation not only of the Funda
mental Standard but also of state
laws against libel, slander and for
gery.
We cannot tolerate this kind of
action and suggest that from now
on letters not be printed unless
they are submitted to The Daily
in person.
(Signed by 37 members
of Soto House)
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Needless to
say, we are sorry that The Daily
was used to hurt Mr. Steil, par
ticularly since he is running for
office. In the past, The Daily has
gone on the principle that, it can
trust Stanford students not to
write forged letters to the paper.
This has seemed to work, but it is
obvious The Daily can no longer
go on this policy.
Since we do not have the time
to personally check that the au
thor of a letter really wrote it,
those who wish letters published
in the future will have to bring
them to the Daily Shack and have
the signature on the letter check
ed with the person’s student body
card.

No letter will be published un
less checked by a Daily staff

member, and letters in the mail
will not be accepted. The limit on
letters is still 300 words.)
YELL LEADING
Editor, The Daily;
As was very much in evidence
at the UCLA game, the level of
cheering at Stanford is not wor
thy to be representative of a
school of Stanford’s supposed
calibre. How long are we, the stu
dents of the best University on
the West Coast, going to tolerate
this brand of “backing our team?”
As 35,000 people watched the
game, and many other listened to
it on the radio, it is obvious that
the public opinion toward Stan
ford University is not improved
by such cheers as “F-U-C—L-
A ”
As we, the freshmen, have no
past experience by which to judge
what is expected of a mature
Stanford student, wo can only in
fer from the examples of upper
classmen that yells like "We have
the Cards, we have the stunts,
but UCLA has the . . . pom pon
girls” are the acceptable and ap
proved norm of conduct.
We would like to remind the
student body that the purpose of
a rooting section is, after all, to
support the team—win or lose. It
was apparent Saturday that many
individuals in the rooting section
didn’t care one way or the other
if the team won or lost.
It was more on their level to
yell crude comments about any
thing that came into their minds,
than to consider the effects these
yells would have.
We feel that the standards of
cheering at Stanford are disgrace
ful and suggest that something
must be done to remedy the situ
ation.

Editor, The Daily:
There I was at the UCLA game,
leading a yell that was supposed
to end, “They’ve got six fine pom
pon girls.” Instead I blew my
lines (a rather regular occur
rence) and ended the yell by say
ing. “They’ve got the pom-pon
girls.”
As a result of my slip many
people though I was trying to be
little Stanford’s fine set of crepe
wavers. I want to make it clear
that this certainly was not my in
tention. These girls have been
working very hard and have been
doing a fine job.
In addition, this is a very con
genial group of girls that is al
ways willing to do something ex
tra. I am very sorry for my slip
of the tongue, and I want to apol
ogize to the Stanford pom-pon
girls and to the rooting section.
