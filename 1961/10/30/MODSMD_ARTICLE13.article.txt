BOMB PROTEST
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to call the stu
dent body’s attention to the fact
that In all probability Chairman
Khrushchev will explode a 50-
megaton atomic device sometime
between noon Monday and noon
Wednesday of this week.
This proposed action has been
condemned by the United Nations
in a resolution sponsored by Nor
way, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland,
Canada, Japan, Iran and Paki
stan. The resolution passed the
General Assembly by a vote of
87-11, with the Soviet Bloc and
Cuba against and Mali abstaining.

K. K. Menon, international sec
retary of the Indian Praia Social
ist Party said Friday of the pro
posed explosion:
“That they (the Soviet Union)
chose the fifth anniversary of
the Hungarian revolution to stage
this callous deed is a cynical re
minder of the Soviet contempt for
freedom and human values.”
We feel Stanford students
should not allow this explosion to
lake place without some gesture
of protest. For this reason, we
plan to keep a 48-hour vigil on the
grass in front of the library from
noon Monday until noon Wednes
day.
Any students who would like to
join us for any part or all of the
48 hours will be cordially wel
comed.

We would also like to point out
that there has been a petition at
Engineering Corner since Thurs
day asking for the immediate ces
sation of atomic testing in the at
mosphere. The petition is in du
plicate; one copy will be sent to
Chairman Khrushchev, the other
to President Kennedy.
Residents and members of the
community of Stanford, Califor
nia, may sign the petition until 5
p.m. Monday, at which time it
will be mailed.

FULL MOON INCIDENT
Editor, The Daily:
The purpose of this letter is not
to dispute what did or did not
happen last Monday night; our
purpose is to make clear the posi
tion of the freshman class. With
this in mind, we submit an apol
ogy to the Stanford student body
and administration.
The class is aware that a seri
ous error has been made and re
grets the lack of judgment dis
played by a few of its members
Monday night. These few disre
garded the responsibility accord
ed them by the University.
The actions of this minority
must not be construed to repre
sent the character of the entire
class. Yet, the freshman class is
responsible for the conduct of any
of its members.
The assurance that a similar
incident will not occur again is
the only meaningful apology we
can make. The Wilbur House of
ficers have met and have taken
steps to carry out this pledge. In
the future, each member of the
class must accept his responsi
bility to the students and admin
istration of Stanford.
The freshman class admits and
apologizes for its mistake.
The Wilbur House Officers
Editor, The Daily:
The reaction to the Quad inci
dent has uncovered a situation
potentially more serious than the
incident itself. The dangerous na
ture of mob psychology is obvi
ous, the "mob psychology” aspect
of disregard and mockery of the
Fundamental Standard itself
more subtle.
The Fundamental Standard is
not part of Morality League-ism.
It is the basic assumption of ma
turity and personal responsibility
upon which conduct in this Uni
versity is, or is supposed to be,
based, from Frosh Pre-Reg until
graduation.
Assault, as concerned in the
Quad incident, and forgery, as
concerned in the letter of the law
do not belong at Stanford. There
are many who would gladly take
their places and who would ac
cept both the benefit and the re
sponsibility of a Stanford educa
tion.

I was asked to add my signa
ture to the above letter, and de
clined. I cannot register my feel
ings about the Stanford character
in terms of the Fundamental
Standard.
The only people with whom I’ve
discussed the latter are some
freshman sponsors and the Wom
en’s Council, and I have no re
spect for their interpretation of
it, no tolerance for their dicta
torial Girl Scout State, no pa
tience with them at all.
So I make these comments with
an eye not to the Standard but to
my own standard of how one hu
man being may best treat an
other. And this University a
word I used to associate with
widespread intellectual excite
ment and a sense of community
in study and research- seems to
contain an inordinate number of
people with no consideration for
others or for education.
If you went to “Dreams” two
weeks ago, you know what I
mean; granted, it wasn’t an ex
cellent film, but certainly de
served a more intelligent recep
tion than it got. I understand that
the Flicks exist to allow the boys
to let off steam, and therefore
suggest that the quality of the
movies shown remain consistent
ly low, on a level with the audi
ence.

If you are in the class whose
professor quotes Greek in order
that we may got the original me
ter of the assigned poems, you

will have heard the students (stu
dents!) titter and talk aloud
while he reads.

These examples, and those in
the above letter, illustrate typical
ly infuriating actions on the part
of a segment of the student body.
It is hard to determine, and per
haps easy to overestimate, the
size of this segment, as it is so
noisy in its stupidity, so obstrep
erous in its selfishness.

I enter my impotent protest not
in hopes of changing anything,
but in order to exorcise a demon.
Sharon Cobb

Kditor, The Daily:
I feel that too many people have
taken the wrong attitude toward
the much-publicized Inner Quad
incident of last Monday night.

First of all. it is absurd to ar
gue that the freshman class is
guilty of some sort of lack of
moral restraint. They are new
here and it is easy to see how a
Daily article which made water
ballooning seem “the thing to do’’
could legitimatize the idea in
their minds.

One of the reasons such a thing
hasn’t happened in years past is
that previous classes did not re
ceive the impression from official
sources that it was a tradition,
much less a duty, to go out there
and mess up the seniors.
Further, Monday night follow
ed their first midterm at Stanford,
and it is common knowledge that
this first midterm is quite a trau
matic experience; there is a mark
ed inclination to afterwards give
up studying for the day. Again,
it is easy to see how this contrib
uted to the incident.

Moreover, to punish over 800
men by a curfew for the misdeeds
of possibly 50 seems hardly in or
der, particularly since I assume
that the miscreants will turn
themselves in.

Then there is the smug and
righteously indignant letter sub
mitted to The Daily by the Inter-
Club and Inter-Fraternity Coun
cils. They either have forgotten
what went on when they were
freshmen or have magnified the
incident out of proportion.
I submit that this incident dif
fers from equally riotous but

largely ignored incidents in the
past chiefly by reason of the at
tention focussed upon it by such
well-meaning hut over-imagina
tive people as Bill Griffin.
I think that in general too much
self-satisfied criticism and too lit
tle understanding have been
forthcoming in the matter.

I was asked to add my signa

ings about the Stanford character
in terms of the Fundamental
Standard.
The only people with whom I’ve
discussed the latter are some
freshman sponsors and the Wom
en’s Council, and I have no re
spect for their interpretation of
it, no tolerance for their dicta
torial Girl Scout State, no pa
tience with them at all.
So I make these comments with
an eye not to the Standard but to
my own standard of how one hu
man being may best treat an
other. And this University a
word I used to associate with
widespread intellectual excite
ment and a sense of community
in study and research- seems to
contain an inordinate number of
people with no consideration for
others or for education.
If you went to “Dreams” two
weeks ago, you know what I
mean; granted, it wasn’t an ex
cellent film, but certainly de
served a more intelligent recep
tion than it got. I understand that
the Flicks exist to allow the boys
to let off steam, and therefore
suggest that the quality of the
movies shown remain consistent
ly low, on a level with the audi
ence.

If you are in the class whose
professor quotes Greek in order
that we may got the original me
ter of the assigned poems, you

will have heard the students (stu
dents!) titter and talk aloud
while he reads.

These examples, and those in
the above letter, illustrate typical
ly infuriating actions on the part
of a segment of the student body.
It is hard to determine, and per

size of this segment, as it is so

I was asked to add my signa
ture to the above letter, and de
clined. I cannot register my feel
ings about the Stanford character
in terms of the Fundamental
Standard.
The only people with whom I’ve
discussed the latter are some
freshman sponsors and the Wom
en’s Council, and I have no re
spect for their interpretation of
it, no tolerance for their dicta
torial Girl Scout State, no pa
tience with them at all.
So I make these comments with
an eye not to the Standard but to
my own standard of how one hu
man being may best treat an
other. And this University a
word I used to associate with
widespread intellectual excite
ment and a sense of community
in study and research- seems to
contain an inordinate number of
people with no consideration for
others or for education.
If you went to “Dreams” two
weeks ago, you know what I
mean; granted, it wasn’t an ex
cellent film, but certainly de
served a more intelligent recep
tion than it got. I understand that
the Flicks exist to allow the boys
to let off steam, and therefore
suggest that the quality of the
movies shown remain consistent
ly low, on a level with the audi
ence.

If you are in the class whose
professor quotes Greek in order
that we may got the original me
ter of the assigned poems, you

will have heard the students (stu
dents!) titter and talk aloud
while he reads.

These examples, and those in
the above letter, illustrate typical
ly infuriating actions on the part
of a segment of the student body.
It is hard to determine, and per
haps easy to overestimate, the
size of this segment, as it is so
noisy in its stupidity, so obstrep
erous in its selfishness.

I enter my impotent protest not
in hopes of changing anything,

I feel that too many people have
taken the wrong attitude toward
the much-publicized Inner Quad
incident of last Monday night.

First of all. it is absurd to ar
gue that the freshman class is
guilty of some sort of lack of
moral restraint. They are new
here and it is easy to see how a
Daily article which made water
ballooning seem “the thing to do’’
could legitimatize the idea in
their minds.

One of the reasons such a thing
hasn’t happened in years past is
that previous classes did not re
ceive the impression from official
sources that it was a tradition,
much less a duty, to go out there
and mess up the seniors.
Further, Monday night follow
ed their first midterm at Stanford,
and it is common knowledge that
this first midterm is quite a trau
matic experience; there is a mark
ed inclination to afterwards give
up studying for the day. Again,
it is easy to see how this contrib
uted to the incident.

Moreover, to punish over 800
men by a curfew for the misdeeds
of possibly 50 seems hardly in or
der, particularly since I assume
that the miscreants will turn
themselves in.

Then there is the smug and
righteously indignant letter sub
mitted to The Daily by the Inter-
Club and Inter-Fraternity Coun
cils. They either have forgotten
what went on when they were
freshmen or have magnified the
incident out of proportion.
I submit that this incident dif
fers from equally riotous but

largely ignored incidents in the
past chiefly by reason of the at
tention focussed upon it by such
well-meaning hut over-imagina

I think that in general too much
self-satisfied criticism and too lit

I was asked to add my signa

Standard.
The only people with whom I’ve
discussed the latter are some
freshman sponsors and the Wom

spect for their interpretation of
it, no tolerance for their dicta
torial Girl Scout State, no pa
tience with them at all.
So I make these comments with
an eye not to the Standard but to
my own standard of how one hu
man being may best treat an
other. And this University a
word I used to associate with
widespread intellectual excite
ment and a sense of community
in study and research- seems to
contain an inordinate number of
people with no consideration for
others or for education.
If you went to “Dreams” two
weeks ago, you know what I
mean; granted, it wasn’t an ex
cellent film, but certainly de
served a more intelligent recep
tion than it got. I understand that
the Flicks exist to allow the boys
to let off steam, and therefore
suggest that the quality of the
movies shown remain consistent
ly low, on a level with the audi
ence.

If you are in the class whose
professor quotes Greek in order
that we may got the original me
ter of the assigned poems, you

will have heard the students (stu
dents!) titter and talk aloud
while he reads.

These examples, and those in
the above letter, illustrate typical

of a segment of the student body.
It is hard to determine, and per

One of the reasons such a thing

that previous classes did not re

much less a duty, to go out there
and mess up the seniors.
Further, Monday night follow

and it is common knowledge that

it is easy to see how this contrib

Moreover, to punish over 800
men by a curfew for the misdeeds
of possibly 50 seems hardly in or

that the miscreants will turn

Then there is the smug and

This proposed action has been

We feel Stanford students

Khrushchev will explode a 50-
megaton atomic device sometime
between noon Monday and noon
Wednesday of this week.
This proposed action has been
condemned by the United Nations
in a resolution sponsored by Nor
way, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland,
Canada, Japan, Iran and Paki
stan. The resolution passed the
General Assembly by a vote of
87-11, with the Soviet Bloc and
Cuba against and Mali abstaining.

K. K. Menon, international sec
retary of the Indian Praia Social
ist Party said Friday of the pro
posed explosion:
“That they (the Soviet Union)
chose the fifth anniversary of
the Hungarian revolution to stage
this callous deed is a cynical re
minder of the Soviet contempt for
freedom and human values.”
We feel Stanford students
should not allow this explosion to
lake place without some gesture
of protest. For this reason, we
plan to keep a 48-hour vigil on the
grass in front of the library from
noon Monday until noon Wednes
day.
Any students who would like to
join us for any part or all of the
48 hours will be cordially wel
comed.

We would also like to point out
that there has been a petition at
Engineering Corner since Thurs
day asking for the immediate ces
sation of atomic testing in the at
mosphere. The petition is in du
plicate; one copy will be sent to
Chairman Khrushchev, the other
to President Kennedy.
Residents and members of the
community of Stanford, Califor
nia, may sign the petition until 5
p.m. Monday, at which time it
will be mailed.

FULL MOON INCIDENT
Editor, The Daily:
The purpose of this letter is not
to dispute what did or did not
happen last Monday night; our
purpose is to make clear the posi
tion of the freshman class. With
this in mind, we submit an apol
ogy to the Stanford student body
and administration.
The class is aware that a seri
ous error has been made and re
grets the lack of judgment dis
played by a few of its members
Monday night. These few disre
garded the responsibility accord
ed them by the University.
The actions of this minority
must not be construed to repre
sent the character of the entire
class. Yet, the freshman class is
responsible for the conduct of any
of its members.
The assurance that a similar
incident will not occur again is
the only meaningful apology we
can make. The Wilbur House of
ficers have met and have taken
steps to carry out this pledge. In
the future, each member of the
class must accept his responsi
bility to the students and admin
istration of Stanford.
The freshman class admits and
apologizes for its mistake.
The Wilbur House Officers
Editor, The Daily:
The reaction to the Quad inci
dent has uncovered a situation
potentially more serious than the
incident itself. The dangerous na
ture of mob psychology is obvi
ous, the "mob psychology” aspect
of disregard and mockery of the
Fundamental Standard itself
more subtle.
The Fundamental Standard is
not part of Morality League-ism.
It is the basic assumption of ma
turity and personal responsibility
upon which conduct in this Uni
versity is, or is supposed to be,
based, from Frosh Pre-Reg until
graduation.
Assault, as concerned in the
Quad incident, and forgery, as
concerned in the letter of the law
do not belong at Stanford. There
are many who would gladly take
their places and who would ac
cept both the benefit and the re
sponsibility of a Stanford educa
tion.

Editor, The Daily:
I was asked to add my signa
ture to the above letter, and de
clined. I cannot register my feel
ings about the Stanford character
in terms of the Fundamental
Standard.
The only people with whom I’ve
discussed the latter are some
freshman sponsors and the Wom
en’s Council, and I have no re
spect for their interpretation of
it, no tolerance for their dicta
torial Girl Scout State, no pa
tience with them at all.
So I make these comments with
an eye not to the Standard but to
my own standard of how one hu
man being may best treat an
other. And this University a
word I used to associate with
widespread intellectual excite
ment and a sense of community
in study and research- seems to
contain an inordinate number of
people with no consideration for
others or for education.
If you went to “Dreams” two
weeks ago, you know what I
mean; granted, it wasn’t an ex
cellent film, but certainly de
served a more intelligent recep
tion than it got. I understand that
the Flicks exist to allow the boys
to let off steam, and therefore
suggest that the quality of the
movies shown remain consistent
ly low, on a level with the audi
ence.

If you are in the class whose
professor quotes Greek in order
that we may got the original me
ter of the assigned poems, you

will have heard the students (stu
dents!) titter and talk aloud
while he reads.

These examples, and those in
the above letter, illustrate typical
ly infuriating actions on the part
of a segment of the student body.
It is hard to determine, and per
haps easy to overestimate, the
size of this segment, as it is so
noisy in its stupidity, so obstrep
erous in its selfishness.

I enter my impotent protest not
in hopes of changing anything,
but in order to exorcise a demon.
Sharon Cobb

Kditor, The Daily:
I feel that too many people have
taken the wrong attitude toward
the much-publicized Inner Quad
incident of last Monday night.

First of all. it is absurd to ar
gue that the freshman class is
guilty of some sort of lack of
moral restraint. They are new
here and it is easy to see how a
Daily article which made water
ballooning seem “the thing to do’’
could legitimatize the idea in
their minds.

One of the reasons such a thing
hasn’t happened in years past is
that previous classes did not re
ceive the impression from official
sources that it was a tradition,
much less a duty, to go out there
and mess up the seniors.
Further, Monday night follow
ed their first midterm at Stanford,
and it is common knowledge that
this first midterm is quite a trau
matic experience; there is a mark
ed inclination to afterwards give
up studying for the day. Again,
it is easy to see how this contrib
uted to the incident.

Moreover, to punish over 800
men by a curfew for the misdeeds
of possibly 50 seems hardly in or
der, particularly since I assume
that the miscreants will turn
themselves in.

Then there is the smug and
righteously indignant letter sub
mitted to The Daily by the Inter-
Club and Inter-Fraternity Coun
cils. They either have forgotten
what went on when they were
freshmen or have magnified the
incident out of proportion.
I submit that this incident dif
fers from equally riotous but

largely ignored incidents in the
past chiefly by reason of the at
tention focussed upon it by such
well-meaning hut over-imagina
tive people as Bill Griffin.
I think that in general too much
self-satisfied criticism and too lit
tle understanding have been
forthcoming in the matter.
