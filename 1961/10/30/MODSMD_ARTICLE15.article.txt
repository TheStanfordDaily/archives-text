# Cactus Jack Praises Strong Tribe Defense
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The “straw” that broke the In
dians’ back can bo attributed to a
had snap from center and a bad
spotting of the ball by the holder.
The “straw,” of course, was the
87-yard runback of a missed field
goal by Hermit Alexander.
Said Coach Jack Curtice, “Lind
skog can kick the hall better than
that off the side of his foot.”
Chris Cottle snapped the ball short
and just as Lindskog started to
kick the ball Chuck Butler moved
it back. Lindskog had to check
his motion, and the resulting kick
was 27 yards short of the up
rights.

ALEXANDER had a big jump
on the Indians, since they were
blocking and didn’t have anyone
downfield to cover in case of a
short kick. Alexander turned on
the speed and went 87 yards down
the middle, outrunning Lindskog,
the last man between him and the
goal.

Curtice was voluble in his praise
of the Stanford defense, despite
his disappointment in the game’s
outcome. “I thought we hustled
and played a real fine game. We
did a tremendous defensive job.”
Curtice allowed that injuries
hurt the Tribe. The big blow to
the Tribe was Steve Thurlow’s ab
sence from the backfield.

STANFORD was in trouble at
the fullback position too. Ken
Babajian still was suffering from
a hip pointer. Tony DeLillis play
ed the first half, but got a hip
pointer—bruised back and was in
street clothes in the second half.

Jay Ward, third string behind
Babajian and DeLillis on the
frosh team last year, was pressed

into service, and Curtice singled
out the 175-pound sophomore for
putting out everything in his sec
ond collegiate football game.
Curtice was unhappy with the
quarterbacks’ inaccuracy, and is
looking anxiously toward the re
sults of today’s medical examina
tion on Thurlow. Just before he
left for parts unknown, Cactus
Jack asked all the scribes to pray
that nothing is wrong with the
rangy quarterback.

his motion, and the resulting kick
was 27 yards short of the up
rights.

ALEXANDER had a big jump
on the Indians, since they were
blocking and didn’t have anyone
downfield to cover in case of a
short kick. Alexander turned on
the speed and went 87 yards down
the middle, outrunning Lindskog,
the last man between him and the
goal.

Curtice was voluble in his praise
of the Stanford defense, despite
his disappointment in the game’s
outcome. “I thought we hustled
and played a real fine game. We
did a tremendous defensive job.”
Curtice allowed that injuries
hurt the Tribe. The big blow to
the Tribe was Steve Thurlow’s ab
sence from the backfield.

STANFORD was in trouble at
the fullback position too. Ken
Babajian still was suffering from
a hip pointer. Tony DeLillis play
ed the first half, but got a hip
pointer—bruised back and was in
street clothes in the second half.

Jay Ward, third string behind
Babajian and DeLillis on the
frosh team last year, was pressed

into service, and Curtice singled
out the 175-pound sophomore for
putting out everything in his sec
ond collegiate football game.
Curtice was unhappy with the
quarterbacks’ inaccuracy, and is
looking anxiously toward the re
sults of today’s medical examina
tion on Thurlow. Just before he
left for parts unknown, Cactus
Jack asked all the scribes to pray
that nothing is wrong with the
rangy quarterback.
The “straw” that broke the In
dians’ back can bo attributed to a
had snap from center and a bad
spotting of the ball by the holder.
The “straw,” of course, was the
87-yard runback of a missed field
goal by Hermit Alexander.
Said Coach Jack Curtice, “Lind
skog can kick the hall better than
that off the side of his foot.”
Chris Cottle snapped the ball short
and just as Lindskog started to
kick the ball Chuck Butler moved
it back. Lindskog had to check
his motion, and the resulting kick
was 27 yards short of the up
rights.
