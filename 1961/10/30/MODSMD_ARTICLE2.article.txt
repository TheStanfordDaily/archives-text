MOSCOW —(UPI)— The 22nd
Soviet Communist Party Con
gress neared the end of two
weeks of dramatic revelations
yesterday with every indication
the Kremlin still plans to explode
its 50-megaton “super-bomb”
within the next 48 hours.
Premier Nikita Khrushchev an
nounced Oct. 17 that he planned
to test the huge nuclear device
Oct. 30 or 31.
Khrushchev, also for the first
time, told his own people of the
dangers of radioactive fallout, but
did not order any special precau
tionary measures.
The 50-megaton bomb blast will
mark the end of the present ser
ies of Soviet test blasts. The
Kremlin is expected to follow it
soon with a new campaign for
total disarmament including a
ban on nuclear weapons.
Russia has set off 25 fallout
producing nuclear blasts since re
suming testing, 24 in the air and
one underwater.
The biggest detonation of the
current Soviet series—a device
estimated to have the force of 30
to 50 million tons of TNT—was
set off in the atmosphere over the
Arctic last Monday.
It was the biggest known man
made explosion in history.
