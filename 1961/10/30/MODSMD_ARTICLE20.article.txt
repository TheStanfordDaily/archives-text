## 
### PETER KING 
In a devastating display of of
fense, which piled up 404 yards
and 41 points, the Stanford frosh
football team romped to its sec
ond victory of the season Satur
day against the UCLA freshmen,
41-12. It was the first loss this
year for the Brubabes, who were
ranked as one of the (op fresh
man teams on the coast.
Coach Dan Stavely was “real
pleased” with the play of Dick
Ragsdale, Phil Humphries, Bucky
Rosen and the whole Stanford de
fensive line. Ragsdale did an ex
cellent job in engineering a varied
Stanford attack, scoring one
touchdown, passing for another,
and gaining 172 yards in total of
fense.
ROSEN accounted for two TD’s,
one on a seven-yard run off
tackle and the other on an 11-
yard pass from Ragsdale. Hum
phries averaged over nine yards a
carry, including a 29-yard touch
down gallop in the first quarter.
Stanford bottled up UCLA com
pletely in the first half, and the
only Bruin threat fell dead on the
Stanford 20-yard line. The tribe’s
defense yielded 231 yards, most
of them in the fourth quarter, and
allowed only five of 20 passes, in
tercepting three.
Midway through the second
quarter, Ragsdale unleashed an
awesome passing attack (hat car
ried the Indians 84 yards in six
plays. An 11-yard aerial to Rosen
put Stanford in front at halftime,
20-0.
THE BRUBABES finally got on
the scoreboard early in the final

period on a five-yard end run by
Larry Zeno. A Bruin touchback
started an 80-yard march, high
lighted by a 52-yard Zeno pass to
end Jim Arens. Both Bruin pass
conversion attempts failed.
A standout on defense was Stan
ford guard Jim Kreitz, who show
ed his alertness by snatching a
Bruin pass thrown by Larry Zeno
and racing 30 yards for a touch
down. Minutes later, he again in
tercepted a Zeno pass and return
ed it 26 yards to set up the Cards’
final touchdown.
Touchdown conversions, a prob
lem earlier in the season, were
made easily. End Braden Beck
kicked four points, and quarter
back Dick Berg booled one.
The Indian frosh continued to
be plagued by fumbleitis, hobbling
the football nine times. However,
UCLA could never capitalize on
any Stanford fumbles. Stanford
topped the Bruins in the first
down department, 13-4, and com
pleted nine of 15 passes for 138
yards.

Coach Stavely played his third
string team the entire fourth
quarter.
