# Winless Indian Booters Bow To Powerful USF Squad, 3-1
## 
### 
Stanford dropped its third
league soccer game of the year to
USF Saturday 3-1. The Indians
have yet to win.

Stanford played well, but
couldn’t contain USF's All-Ameri
can forward Jim Lynch. Lynch,
who has made a habit of ruining
Stanford for the past two years
while he attended CCSF, did it
again. He scored all three of his
team’s goals Saturday, continuing
his fine performances against
Stanford which include scoring
both goals in a CCSF 2-1 win two
years ago and three goals when
City College won 5-1 last year.
And, according to Stanford soc
cer coach Fred Priddle, Bill Hatch
and Walt Dittel did a good job to
hold Lynch to the three goals he

scored.
Stanford’s goal was scored by
Albert Nnoli on a perfect corner
kick.
Priddle was pleased with the
Stanford defense, and singled out
fullback Edgar Berger, halfback
Rusty Williams and goalie Dave
Dierdorff for excellent work.
