# Held Scoreless, Indians Manage To Maintain Credible Offense
## 
### 
BY BEN TIPTON
A good goal-line stand, the fine
play of Mike Heffner, and a pair
of free touchdowns gave UCLA’s
Bruins all the push they needed
to get by Stanford 20-0 Saturday
in Stanford Stadium.
With 4:15 remaining in the first
quarter, the Indians had the ball
and a first down on the Bruin nine
yard line. A plunge at the center
netted a yard. Stan Lindskog tried
right end three times with dimin
ishing results, going for four, two
and one and a half yards succes
sively and stalling a 41-yard drive
inside the UCLA one-yard line.
Led by Haffner, the visitors
wont ahead to stay with a minute
remaining in the second quarter.

The sophomore tailback rifled a
26-yard pass to Jim Bergman on
the Stanford 41 and then pounded
i out 29 yards in six carries as the
Bruins marched to paydirt in
eight plays. Haffner scored off
left tackle from a yard out.
With three seconds remaining
in the half, the Cards tried a field
goal from the UCLA 35. Lind
-1 skog’s short kick was caught by
the Bruin’s Kermit Alexander,
who eluded the whole Stanford
team while rambling 87 yards for
a touchdown. Bob Smith booted
his second extra point of the day
to make the halftime score 14-6.
i And it all happened in little over a
1 minute.
UCLA scored again late in the

third quarter, as an errant Indian
aerial was gathered in by John
Walker and carried 36 yards,
again through and around several
would-be Indian tacklers.
The score doesn’t do justice to
the sturdy Card defense, how
ever. They held the power-laden
Bruins to 152 yards on the ground,
compared to the Udans’ previous
228-yard rushing average. The de
fensive ends especially did a near
spectacular job of containing
UCLA’s single wing sweeps.
The Stanford pass defense main
tained its position as the best in
the Big Five Conference, yielding
only one completion good for 26
yards. That was a big one, though,
the Haffner-Bergman aerial which
put the Bruins on the way to their
first score.
Although unable to produce the
necessary points, Stanford’s of
fense showed up creditably
against a tough UCLA defense.
Card backs ran for 131 yards, and
the passing of quarterbacks Rod


GANG TACKLING typified the Stanford defense all Saturday afternoon. The ball carrier for UCLA is
fullback Joe Zeno (28). Stanford tacklers identifiable are Frank Patitucci (82) and Gary Sargent (34).
