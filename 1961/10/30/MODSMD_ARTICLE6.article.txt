# HOSTILITY
## Yell Leader Rallies Cancelled by Bischoff 
### 
Elections Commission chairman Chuck Bischoff lias cancelled
proposed noon rallies for head yell leader candidates this week. He
said that crowds had been actively hostile to the candidates so that
it seemed the best way to campaign was not to be seen at all.

Rain dampened the football
rally Friday night and a vicious
crowd put cold water on the head
yell-leader candidates’ presenta
tion Saturday.
Two rallies will be held con
currently tomorrow night at Wil
bur. While freshman president
and LASSU representative can
didates are addressing one sec
tion, class vice president nomi
nees will appear at the other. See
tomorrow’s Daily for time and
place.
Sue Bailey has withdrawn as a
candidate for LASSU representa
tive from Branner, leaving Ann
Kovacovich and Carole Hanson in
the race.
Voting in the primary elections
will be held at Engineering Cor
ner and at the Post Office Wed
nesday and Thursday and in the
Library Wednesday evening.
The true identity of the candi
date for head yell leader cam
paigning as F.S.R., the mysteri
ous Mexican, was revealed during
the UCLA game Saturday.
After he rode into the stadium
on his burro a banner appeared
reading: “F.S.R.. the Mysterious
Mexican, is Fred S. Richards.”
The banner was quickly ripped
to shreds by the wind.
Bruce Lemm, the “supernatu
ral” candidate for head yell lead
er, has been seen with a “ghastly
Vampira” on campus. The roman
tic couple was circulating among
the crowd before Saturday’s
game.
In other elections matters, it
was learned that Pete Steil, a
candidate for Legislature from
Wilbur Hall, did not write the
letter to the editor that was
attributed to him in Friday’s
Daily.
The letter was a forgery, let- 1
ters on page 2 of today’s paper
indicate.
