# Goal Posts, Fan Downed
## 
### 
A near-riot which resulted in
the overnight hospitalization of
a UCLA student broke out after
Saturday's football game as vic
torious Bruin students tore down
the goal posts.
UCLA student Don Heimer was
struck in the face and spent the
night in the Stanford-Palo Alto
Hospital. X-rays showed he was
only bruised and he was released
yesterday in “fine” shape, accord
ing to a hospital spokesman.
The melee occurred after the
Bruins had clobbered the Indians,
20-0, before a crowd of 35,000
which included about 200 UCLA
students.
BIGHT AFTER the game end
ed a group augmented by local
kids—rushed the north end goal
posts but was repulsed by Stan
ford student police and Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies.
The group then sprinted toward
the south end goals posts but
again was turned back, with stu
dent cops knocking a few heads
together.
A brief Itlll ensued while sev
eral UCLA students exhorted
those in Ihe cheering section
—over the cheer leaders’ micro
phone to “come on down and get
the goal posts.”
The posts were broken up, and
one group of UCLA students was
pursued into the stands by Stan
ford students and a few student
cops. It was about this time that
Heimer was injured as he tripped
while leaping from the stands
and taken from the Stadium by
ambulance.
