# INCORRECT ADDRESSES
## Mail Problems Cause Slower Student Service 
### PETER L. BOYNTON 
Twenty-one man-hours a day
and $15,000 a year are spent in
looking up incorrectly addressed
mail at the Stanford Post Office.
Stanford students will have to
advise correspondents of the cor
rect method of addressing mail or
be inconvenienced by having
many of their letters returned to
the sender, warned Acting .Super
intendent .Quinn in a recent inter
view.
Quinn is temporarily replacing
Superintendent Callahan, who
should return in November.
Quinn pointed out that in 1951
a law was passed which in effect
made it illegal for a post office to
look up incorrectly addressed in
the University Directory. Enforce
ment of this ruling has been lax
in the past, but the San Francisco
main office is beginning to crack
down.
Outside of the address problem,
the two-year-old post office has
been a boon for both students and
post office employees. According
to Quinn the efficiency of the new
building more than makes up for
the lack of personal contact be
tween Stanford people and the
employees. Students and faculty
get to know the clerks through
package pick-ups and stamp pur
chases. but the days of having
your mail ready at the General
Delivery window because a clerk
who knew you saw you coming
are gone.
As a last point Quinn empha
sized that in having a government
post office on campus Stanford
students have a big advantage
over other universities where mail
is often distributed by university
employees. This method of dis
tribution is generally more costly
for the students, he pointed out.
