# Auto Wreck Kills Three Students at Stanford-in-France
## 
### 
three Stanford students on a weekend trip from France to Spain
were killed early Saturday when their car went off the road and
struck a tree in south-central France. A fourth student suffered

minor injuries,
Tlie dead students were ident

ified as Karen Ewing, 19; Judith
Sikes, 20; and Paul F. Sikora, 20.
Injured was Albert K. Lesar, 19.
All except Miss Ewing were
studying at Stanford's overseas
campus at Tours, France. Miss
Ewing had attended the previous
session at Tours, and had been
motoring through Europe since
that session ended in early Sep
tember.
I)H. ROBERT WALKER, head
of the overseas campus program,
talked by phone with Prof. Paul
LeMoal, director of the Tours cen
ter, Saturday.
Walker told The Daily yester
day that LeMoal gave this account
of the accident:
Miss Ewing had arranged to
meet the three others on Friday
in Tours and drive with them to
Spain for a three-day All-Saints
Day weekend celebration.
MISS EWING arrived late in
Tours Friday morning, and the
other students almost went ahead
without her. As far as could be
determined, they left Tours some
time Friday afternoon.
Walker said a rumor that Miss
Ewing, who was driving the rent
ed car, fell asleep is unfounded.
First reports indicated that she
reached over to dim her car’s
lights for an on-coming auto, and
in doing so accidently turned
them off. In the dark the car sped
off Ihe road and hit the tree. The
headlights did not fail, he said, as
earlier reported.
LEMOAL TOLD Walker that
Lesar is out of danger and is ex
pected to be released from a
French hospital today or tomor
’row.
Walker said the rules presently
in effect governing travel by
Tours students prohibit students
from leaving on trips on Thursday
nights, as they previously were
allowed to do. Friday at 6 a.m.
is the earliest they may leave
now.
Sikora’s father is flying from
the family home at Columbia,
Calif., to claim his son’s body. Si
kora was a junior majoring in in
ternational relations.
MISS EWING was a junior
English major. Her body is being
sent to her home in Santa Bar
bara. Miss Sikes, from Eugene,
Ore., also was a junior but was
undecided on her major. Both
girls lived at Guthrie House while
at Stanford and were active in
campus activities.
Lesar is the son of a professor
of law at Washington University
in St. Louis. He is a sophomore
and lived in Stern as a freshman
last year.

Sikora, Lesar and Miss Sikes
arrived in France in September
and would have stayed until
March in the six-month overseas
program.
