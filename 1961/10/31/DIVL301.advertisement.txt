An artist’s conception of Project Gnome, a step toward providing power and isotopes from under
ground thermonuclear detonations. This area of endeavor is part of Project Plowshare, initiated at
the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. Other Plowshare projects under
study include the excavation of an experimental harbor in Alaska, production of oil from tar sands,
control of groundwaters, mining applications, and other novel ideas using the energy of nuclear
explosives.
