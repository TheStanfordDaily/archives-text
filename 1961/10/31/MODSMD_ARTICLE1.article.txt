# IFC Votes to Continue Spring Freshman Rush
## 
### 
The Inter-Fraternity Council
voted down two new fraternity
rush proposals last night.
This action by the IFC will
cause the present system of rush
to continue, said IFC President
Swede Pierson.
The first of the two defeated
plans proposed by the IFC would
have gone into effect this spring.
It would have maintained rush
during spring quarter but would
have moved it forward into spring
vacation. Advocates of this plan
felt that it would minimize upset
study schedules.
The alternate plan, the “Wil
bur Sponsors’ Plan,” would have
eliminated the no-contact rule be
tween fraternity members and
freshmen, and would have sched
uled formal rush just prior to
registration of the sophomores.
This plan was favored by Dean
of Men William G. Craig. He
stated in The Daily last Tuesday
that this plan would cut down
freshman drinking, eliminate
study problems that the present
rush program causes, and allow
freshmen to continue their loyalty
to their freshman houses.
The defeat of the now rush pro
posals does not necessarily mean
that the IFC wholeheartedly sup
ports the present system. A meas
ure to put the full power of the
IFC behind the present system
was also defeated by the council.
A new compromise proposal de
signed to include several of the
ideas present in the defeated plans
is under consideration by the
council.
One IFC representative has pro
posed a plan which would not
change the time of rush but would
change the system to a low-pres
sure one which would permit
freshman contact.
Professor James T. Watkins IV,
who was present at the meeting,
announced to the council members
that faculty and administration
support of the proposals was split.
Dean Craig favored the sopho
more rush proposal, while Dean
Winbigler was against it.
The IFC had been considering
the proposals that were defeated

ever since last spring quarter
when campus and administration
opinion favored a change in the
rush system.
Pierson, who favored the IFC
proposal, will issue a statement
today giving the council’s view
| point and reasons for the defeat
of the proposals.
