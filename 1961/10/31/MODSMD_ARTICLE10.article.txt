# 50-Megaton Blast Recorded
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Russia
yesterday set off a nuclear bomb
that packed the punch of 50 mil
lion tons of TNT and hurled
shock waves around the world
equal to those generated by the
great 1883 Krakatoa volcanic
eruption.
The White House promptly de
nounced the blast whose effects
also were compared to the 1908
Siberian meteorite explosion—as
a Soviet effort to create “fright
and panic” and force the free
world to accept any Soviet de
mand.
THE U.S. Atomic Energy Com
mission said the Soviets exploded
the bomb at an altitude of about
12,000 feet.
In a special statement, the
White House said the Soviet ex
plosion was “a political rather
than a military act” because it
“does not affect the basic balance
of nuclear power.” But the White
House added, “It will produce
more radioactive fallout than any
pi'evious explosion.”
And in a solemn warning to
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrush
chev, the White House declared
that “the United States today has
ample military power to destroy
any nation which would unleash
thermo-nuclear war.”
THE SUPER bomb fired by Ni
kita Khrushchev’s scientists over
shadowed the weapon exploded by
the Soviets last Monday—until
then the biggest man-made explo
sion in history.
The U.S. Atomic Energy Com
mission yesterday placed the
forces of the previous blast at 25
megatons and said preliminary
studies indicated that yesterday’s
blast was about 50 megatons—so
million tons of TNT.
Other non-Communist nations
joined the White House in de
also were some demands in this
country that the Russian action
be met with U.S. tests in the at
mosphere to improve America’s
warheads.
THE COMPARISON with the
Krakatoa and meteorite explo
sions was drawn by the U.S.
Weather Bureau. It also reported
that fallout from the “dirty” blast
would start drifting across this
country in several days. Winds
now are taking it over Siberia.
In Western eyes, the only good
thing about the shot was that it
presumably wound up the Soviet
nuclear test series that started
Sept. 1. Khrushchev had said the
tests would end Oct. 30 or 31 with
a 50-megaton explosion.
IN THE AWESOME Krakatoa
explosion, an island in the Sunda
Straits between Sumatra and
Java was blown to bits. A tidal
wave washed nearby islands, kill
ing 36.000. Dust in the upper at
mosphere traveled around the
world many times.
At the United Nations, U.S. Am
bassador Adlai E. Stevenson term
ed it an “arrogant act” that sent
the world on “a great leap back
ward toward anarchy and disas
ter.” The Dutch ambassador to
the U.N. called it “an act of terror
against humanity.”

At the United Nations, U.S. Am
bassador Adlai E. Stevenson term

WASHINGTON (UPD—Russia
yesterday set off a nuclear bomb
that packed the punch of 50 mil
lion tons of TNT and hurled
shock waves around the world
equal to those generated by the
great 1883 Krakatoa volcanic
eruption.
The White House promptly de
nounced the blast whose effects
also were compared to the 1908
Siberian meteorite explosion—as
a Soviet effort to create “fright
and panic” and force the free
world to accept any Soviet de
mand.
THE U.S. Atomic Energy Com
mission said the Soviets exploded
the bomb at an altitude of about
12,000 feet.
In a special statement, the
White House said the Soviet ex
plosion was “a political rather
than a military act” because it
“does not affect the basic balance
of nuclear power.” But the White
House added, “It will produce
more radioactive fallout than any
pi'evious explosion.”
And in a solemn warning to
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrush
chev, the White House declared
that “the United States today has
ample military power to destroy
any nation which would unleash
thermo-nuclear war.”
THE SUPER bomb fired by Ni
kita Khrushchev’s scientists over
shadowed the weapon exploded by
the Soviets last Monday—until
then the biggest man-made explo
sion in history.
The U.S. Atomic Energy Com
mission yesterday placed the
forces of the previous blast at 25
megatons and said preliminary
studies indicated that yesterday’s
blast was about 50 megatons—so
million tons of TNT.
Other non-Communist nations
joined the White House in de
also were some demands in this
country that the Russian action
be met with U.S. tests in the at
mosphere to improve America’s
warheads.
THE COMPARISON with the
Krakatoa and meteorite explo
sions was drawn by the U.S.
Weather Bureau. It also reported
that fallout from the “dirty” blast
would start drifting across this
country in several days. Winds
now are taking it over Siberia.
In Western eyes, the only good
thing about the shot was that it
presumably wound up the Soviet
nuclear test series that started
Sept. 1. Khrushchev had said the
tests would end Oct. 30 or 31 with
a 50-megaton explosion.
IN THE AWESOME Krakatoa
explosion, an island in the Sunda
Straits between Sumatra and
Java was blown to bits. A tidal
wave washed nearby islands, kill
ing 36.000. Dust in the upper at
mosphere traveled around the
world many times.
