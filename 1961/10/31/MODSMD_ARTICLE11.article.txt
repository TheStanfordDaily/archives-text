## The 						Deed Is Done-Humanity Suffers

The deed is done.
I he Soviet Union yesterday exploded what the experts say was
at least a 50-megaton nuclear weapon—the largest explosion in hu
man history.
We can add little to the overwhelming chorus of indignation
and disgust voiced by leaders and ordinary citizens the world over.
Suffice it to say that Nikita Khrushchev has committed a crime
against humanity and humanity will be feeling the effects of his
crime for generations to come.
The Herblock cartoon to the right of this editorial expresses our
feelings perfectly. It gave us an odd sensation when we first glanced
at it; it still docs. Aside from being a cutting comment on Soviet
nuclear testing, it represents to ns the folly of the direction the hu
man race is taking.
An example of that folly popped forth immediately after the
announcement yesterday that the big bomb had been dropped.
Various elements in this country immediately declared that we, too,
should start testing our nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. The
idea is that we must keep in step with the Russians; that we can’t
let them get an edge on us in nuclear warfare. The stupidity of
these statements irks us just as much as the Soviet action.
The benefits of more nuclear testing in the atmosphere by the
U.S. surely cannot be justified when one examines the results which
such testing would bring. For one thing, it would increase the radio
active fallout. This is a fact which doesn’t seem to bother many
generals and scientists, who must wonder why so many mothers
become upset at the thought of more radioactivity added to the
earth’s atmosphere.

Were upset, too. An Administration spokesman revealed last
week that the United States possesses “tens of thousands” of nuclear
weapons, and that our defense is more than adequate. If this is so,
it would seem difficult to back up a demand for nuclear testing in
the atmosphere to improve our defenses. We don’t need to list the
eminent leaders who have pointed out the uselessness of a super
bomb in warfare; let us just point out that the list begins with John
F. Kennedv.

The war psychology which grips this country, Russia and so many
of the leaders of both countries also worries us. The situation can
not continue this way much longer there are too many possible
sparking points to set off the nuclear inferno. Perhaps the adults
aren't being unduly pessimistic who ask children today, “What are
you going to do if you grow up?”
