QUESTION: “Does football pay
its way at Stanford?”
Answered by Dan Stavely, frosh
football coach.
“First of all, Stanford is no dif
ferent from any other school
which supports a major intercol
legiate athletic program, in that
football must pay not only its own
way, but must also support other
sports wh(ere revenue through
spectator interest is not suffici
ent to keep competition in that
sport of major caliber.
“In addition to supporting other
sports in the curriculum, football
at Stanford has done many other
things quite unique. Branner Hall
was built by the surplus funds
which accrued from the huge
crowds and bowl appearances of
the famed “Vow Boys.”
Fifty thousand dollars was con
tributed to the first million-dollar
endowment fund at Stanford. The
women’s physical education plant
also was made possible through

surplus funds from football at
Stanford.
“IN ADDITION, football has
maintained the finest athletic fa
cilities in the nation, the second
largest colleged-owned stadium,
the finest college baseball plant
and our excellent track and field
facilities. Most of the physical
education plant at Stanford also
wavs built from football funds.
“True, there is increased com
petition for the entertainment dol
lar in the Bay Area and the foot
ball crowds have diminished in
the past four -years. This is due in
part to the other sports compe
tition, but is also due to the fact
that Stanford has had its poorest
over all record during this period.
“Even during these ‘drouth
years,’ Stanford’s football has
more than paid for itself,
“O N E financial contribution
that cannot be overlooked is that
funds made available for grants
and other forms of aid have en
abled many outstanding student
athletes to attend Stanford, grad
uate and later distinguish them
selves in community service, busi
ness and science.

“Football as well as every sport
can point with pride to the men
who have made all these things
possible.”
