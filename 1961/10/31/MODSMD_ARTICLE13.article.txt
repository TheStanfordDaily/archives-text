EDUCATION QUESTIONS
Editor, The Daily:
The October issue of Harper’s
magazine contains several articles
which are highly critical of the
college scene. Of special interest
are those on the nature of the col
lege system, on sex among the
students, on college politics and
on religion.
Maybe the articles are extreme
in their criticism and therefore ir
relevant, but they ought to be dis
cussed before they are brushed
under the rug. The lack of discus
sion would tend to support all that
their writers say.
Basically, all the articles sug
gest that the schools, their admin
istration and their faculty, have
found themselves in a sellers’ mar
ket.
They can therefore offer us a
shoddy product which we ignorant
students, sheep that we are, ac
cept as the best available as we
swallow our disappointment. Stu
dents are criticized as spineless,
apathetic, gullible drifters.
All this may be no more than

the habitual grousing of self-con
temptous professors, but they sug
gest some questions which might
be worth asking:
1.) Is student government “en
couraged, not to give the students
an opportunity to govern them
selves, but as away of rendering
genuine political interest innocu
ous?”

2. Is it “the standing assump
tion” of our professors “that ulti
mate questions are in principle un
answerable and hence not worth
asking seriously?”
3. Do we students dive into sen
timent and the excitement of ac
tive protest in order to avoid the
difficulties of rational thought and
to escape the frustration of our
lack of power and responsibility?”
There are at least 92 more ques
tions, most of them less abstract,
suggested by these articles. They
are all fundamental and demand
debate. If there is to be a revolu
tion, liberal or conservative, let it
begin here with the things that
are of immediate concern to all of
us.

their writers say.
Basically, all the articles sug
gest that the schools, their admin
istration and their faculty, have
found themselves in a sellers’ mar
ket.
They can therefore offer us a
shoddy product which we ignorant
students, sheep that we are, ac
cept as the best available as we
swallow our disappointment. Stu
dents are criticized as spineless,
apathetic, gullible drifters.
All this may be no more than

the habitual grousing of self-con
temptous professors, but they sug
gest some questions which might
be worth asking:
1.) Is student government “en
couraged, not to give the students
an opportunity to govern them
selves, but as away of rendering
genuine political interest innocu
ous?”

2. Is it “the standing assump
tion” of our professors “that ulti
mate questions are in principle un
answerable and hence not worth
asking seriously?”
3. Do we students dive into sen
timent and the excitement of ac
tive protest in order to avoid the
difficulties of rational thought and
to escape the frustration of our
lack of power and responsibility?”
There are at least 92 more ques
tions, most of them less abstract,
suggested by these articles. They
are all fundamental and demand
debate. If there is to be a revolu
tion, liberal or conservative, let it
begin here with the things that
are of immediate concern to all of
us.
