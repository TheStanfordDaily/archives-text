(EDITOR’S NOTE: Through a
typing error, the last paragraph
of the letter from 26 persons
printed in yesterday’s paper was
garbled. The corrected paragraph
follows.)
“Assault, as concerned in the
Quad incident, and forgery, as
concerned in the letter of “Pete
Steil,” are not only outside the
spirit of the Fundamental Stan
dard, but also outside the law.
“Those who believe neither in
the spirit nor in the letter of the
law do not belong at Stanford.
There are many who would gladly
take their places and who would
accept both the benefit and the
responsibility of a Stanford edu
cation.”
