Cactus Jack Curtice did yesterday something lie has done with
monotonous regularity since the 1961 football season has begun.
Il«' praised the defensive unit of the Stanford football team.
Curtice said at the weekly luncheon of the Northern California
Football Writers, “I don’t know how we can play so well and get

boat 200.” Curtico was referring
to Stanford’s outgaining UCLA in
total yardage, only to have the
Bruins come up with the big play,
the long gainer, and score with
explosive power.
CURTICE continued, “The de
fense was fine, the best since I’ve
been at Stanford. I wanted to hold

outstanding linebacker John But
ler as their lineman of (he week.
Butler time after time turned in
the vaunted UCLA end sweeps
and stopped up the middle of the
line on the powerful smashes by
tailbacks Mike Haffner and Bob
Smith.
The Butler-led Stanford defens
ive line held UCLA to almost 100
yards less than their running
average per game.
The Northern California writers’
back of the week was quarterback
Chon Gallegos of San Jose State.
The passing arm of Gallegos led
the Spartans to an upset 21-19 win
over pass-minded Washington
State.

their running attack ever since I
came here. We did it, and look
what happened,”
Curtice said that Stanford
would have to be able to tackle,
run, and block faster and better to
beat Oregon, next opponent on the
Tribe’s schedule.
Oregon defeated Washington
7-6 Saturday to even their season’s
record at three wins and three
losses.

THE BIG problem for Stanford
is the uncertain status of sopho
more quarterback Steve Thurlow.
Thurlow had just worked himself
to a starting job when he fell vic
tim to a disease that may be mon
onucleosis. If it is, he’s out for the
season. If not he will play again
this year.
Tests were taken yesterday, but
the results won’t be known for
forty-eight hours.
Aside from Thurlow, Stanford
has three fullbacks and a tackle
on the injured list. All but one
should be ready for Oregon.
The lone player who won’t face
Oregon is fullback Hal Steuber,
who is out with a fractured jaw.
He is a good possibility to be
ready for USC. The other injured
players are fullbacks Tony De-
Lellis and Ken Babajian and
tackle A1 Hildebrand.
DeLellis has a hip bruise and
strain, Babajian has a hip pointer
and Hildebrand has a strained
foot.

Aside from Thurlow, Stanford
has three fullbacks and a tackle

ready for USC. The other injured
players are fullbacks Tony De-

tackle A1 Hildebrand.
DeLellis has a hip bruise and

Curtice said that Stanford
would have to be able to tackle,
