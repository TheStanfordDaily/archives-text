NEW YORK (UPD—California
athletic director Pete Newell yes

Coast grid powers on out-of-state
manpower drain and increased
interest in the pros.
As to West Coast football, which
once turned out its national pow
erhouses, Newell laid its decline
to “dissipated talent” and a “cycle
of losing” with an attendance de
cline due to losing teams, pro foot
ball, and increased interest in
other sports.
Newell added that California’s
former powerhouses also were in

“a cycle of losing” which “it takes
a long time to overcome,” The
cause of such a decline, he analyz
ed, comes with the decline of
alumni activity, “disenchantment”
of key men, more demands on the
time of winning coaches and the
reluctance of good players to go
with a losing team “because they
want to play with a winner.”
