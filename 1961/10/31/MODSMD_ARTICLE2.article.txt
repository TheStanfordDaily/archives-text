# Stalin Body Out of Tomb
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPD—The 22nd So
viet Communist Party Congress
yesterday ordered Josef Stalin’s
body removed from the Commu
nist shrine he shared with V. I.
Lenin in Moscow’s Red Square
for burial in some undisclosed
place.
The congress also unanimously
decreed that Stalin’s name be
erased from the huge red granite
tomb and that henceforth it be
known as “The Mausoleum of
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.”
THE TEMPLE-LIKE tomb was
closed “for repairs” Sunday and
there was some speculation that
the embalmed body of the late
premier already had been secretly
moved from its resting place of
honor alongside Lenin.

Observers said the further hu
miliation Of the leader of the So
viet Communists for three decades
could have important repercus
sions in other Communist coun
tries, particularly China. The Red
Chinese have made no attempt to
hide the fact that: they do not see
eye to eye with Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev in his attacks on
Slalinist policies.

Only last week, Premier Chou
En-lai placed a wreath at the tomb
with the inscription: “To Stalin,
the great Marxist, Leninist.”
TO MOST Muscovites, the con
gress’ action came somewhat as
a surprise. The ordinary Russian
had not known of Khrushchev’s
harsh criticisms of Stalin’s tyran
nical regime at the 1956 party

congress.
Radio Moscow announced the
removal of Stalin’s body to a less
hallowed place.
