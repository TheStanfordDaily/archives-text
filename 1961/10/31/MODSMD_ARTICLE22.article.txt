# Harriers Lose to Cal Beat UCLA
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Stanford’s highly touted cross
country runners faded in the
stretch Saturday, and Cal’s under
dog harriers slipped past them to
win the triangular competition
with 30 points to Stanford’s 35,
with UCLA far behind at 68. |
There was only one word for
Coach Payton Jordan’s reaction
after he watched his young
charges overtaken at the finish;
“disappointed." “They learned
another lesson today,” lamented
the coach. “They had it won and
gave it away. They let themselves
down."
AFTER THREE miles the In
dian runners were bunched to
gether, five among the top seven.
Just a few hundred yards from
the finish, each individual Stan
ford runner was slightly ahead of
his Bear counterpart. But at the
end, when it counted, that situa
tion was practically reversed,
with Cal runners second, fourth,
fifth, ninth and tenth, compared
to Stanford’s third, sixth, seventh,
eighth and eleventh.
The only bright spot for the
Cards was the running of Bill (
Pratt, who finished third behind i
Milford Dahl of UCLA and John j
Hatton of Cal. Dahl’s winning |

time was 21:20.5. Weym Kirk
land, Paul Schlicke, Rich Klier
and Dave Stinobeck, in that order,
were the other Indians to count
in the scoring. John Northway
and Harlan Andrews were 13th
and 14th, respectively.
This was the same group, with
the addition of Klier, which had
run away from Cal the past two
weekends. But Saturday they
were just plain outfought and
outhustled. “From now on we

have everything to lose,” Jordan
pointed out. “We’re not the fa
vorites anymore.”
WITH HACKS scheduled in the
coming weeks against San Jose
and Cal, along with always-tough
Idaho, there was reason for his
pessimism. But at the same time
he expressed the hope that his
runners would show the kind of
determination which brought last
year Stanford from the bottom of
the heap to the Coast champion
ships. Perhaps the Indians have
to be underdogs before they can
win.
The defeat was a close one, and
it could easily have gone the
other way. The Stanford runners

still have all the ability they had
before, and a lot more experience.
The season is less than half over.

and they will have plenty of
chances to prove they really were
as good as their press notices.

determination which brought last
year Stanford from the bottom of
the heap to the Coast champion
ships. Perhaps the Indians have
to be underdogs before they can
win.
The defeat was a close one, and
it could easily have gone the
other way. The Stanford runners

still have all the ability they had
before, and a lot more experience.
The season is less than half over.

and they will have plenty of
chances to prove they really were
as good as their press notices.
Stanford’s highly touted cross
country runners faded in the
stretch Saturday, and Cal’s under
dog harriers slipped past them to
win the triangular competition
with 30 points to Stanford’s 35,
with UCLA far behind at 68. |
There was only one word for
Coach Payton Jordan’s reaction
after he watched his young
charges overtaken at the finish;
“disappointed." “They learned
another lesson today,” lamented
the coach. “They had it won and
gave it away. They let themselves
down."
AFTER THREE miles the In
dian runners were bunched to
gether, five among the top seven.
Just a few hundred yards from
the finish, each individual Stan
ford runner was slightly ahead of
his Bear counterpart. But at the
end, when it counted, that situa
tion was practically reversed,
with Cal runners second, fourth,
fifth, ninth and tenth, compared
to Stanford’s third, sixth, seventh,
eighth and eleventh.
The only bright spot for the
Cards was the running of Bill (
Pratt, who finished third behind i
Milford Dahl of UCLA and John j
Hatton of Cal. Dahl’s winning |

time was 21:20.5. Weym Kirk
land, Paul Schlicke, Rich Klier
and Dave Stinobeck, in that order,
were the other Indians to count
in the scoring. John Northway
and Harlan Andrews were 13th
and 14th, respectively.
This was the same group, with
the addition of Klier, which had
run away from Cal the past two
weekends. But Saturday they
were just plain outfought and
outhustled. “From now on we

have everything to lose,” Jordan
pointed out. “We’re not the fa
vorites anymore.”
WITH HACKS scheduled in the
coming weeks against San Jose
and Cal, along with always-tough
Idaho, there was reason for his
