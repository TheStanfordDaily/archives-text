# Christmas Play Will Start New Drama Venture
## 
### 
Christmas will come to the cam
pus in boistrous medieval fashion,
with the presentation of “The
Second Shepard’s Play” on the
Quad in early December.
The play, to be directed by
James Clancy, new faculty mem
ber of the department of Speech
and Drama, will herald the begin
ning of a new venture called the
Studio Theatre. The purpose of
the program will be to present
simplified but expert productions
in addition to the regular Stan
ford Players season of plays.
These productions will increase
the range of opportunity for stu
dents, not necessarily specializing
in drama, who would be interested
in participating in unusual plays
and styles of performance. Em
phasis in the Studio Theatre will
be on the play and the actor
rather than upon elaborate scen
ery or costume.
Prof. Clancy was formerly the
director of a highly successful ex
perimental theatre program at the
University of lowa.
“I have directed in a variety of
theatre.” Dr. Clancy slated, “but
one of the most exciting theatre
experiences has come about in an
improvised theatre situation
which demands active, imagina
tive participation by both the au
dience and the actors.”
Under consideration for produc
tion in winter quarter is Apollin
aire’s “The Breasts of Tiresias.”
Future plays will be drawn from
contemporary and historical dra
ma.
The first meeting of students
interested in participating in the
Studio Theatre will lake place to
morrow at 7:30 p.m. in Room 125
of Mem And. Refreshments will
be served and all interested stu
dents are urged to come, even if
they have no theatre experience.
