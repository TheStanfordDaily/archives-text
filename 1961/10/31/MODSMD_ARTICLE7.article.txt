# Russ Explode Giant Bomb; Students Camp in Protest
## Students Sleep On Libe Lawn 
### 
Several students spent a chilly
night on the lawn in front of the
main library last night as part of
a 24-hour protest against Russia’s
superbomb and all nuclear testing
in the atmosphere.
The four originators of the pro
test were joined by several other
men students in their overnight
vigil, part of the protest which
began at noon yesterday and was
scheduled to end at noon today.
A petition calling for “complete
and final cessation of atomic test
ing in the atmosphere 1 ' had been
signed by 415 faculty members,
Students and staff members up to
9 o’clock last night.
THE DEMONSTRATION was
organized by David Quarles, Leon
Haller, Joel Meister and Mark
Mir-sky. They had originally plan
ned to camp out in froht of the
library from yesterday noon to
tomorrow noon, but changed to a
24-hour protest when the Soviet
Union touched off its 50-raegaton
bomb early yesterday.
The protest attracted a good
deal of campus attention yester
day, and reporters and photog
raphers from San Francisco news
papers and television stations vis
ited the scene early in the after
noon.
The petition, which was started
last Thursday, was tentatively
scheduled to be mailed to Presi
dent Kennedy and Premier
Khrushchev at noon today,
Quarles said.
“WE FEEL that the best indi
cation of sane . . . leadership to
day is self-control and responsi
bility to all people of the world,”
the petition declares.
Among faculty members sign
ing the petition were Otis Pease,
history; Virgil Whitaker, Thomas
Moser, Irving Howe, Albert Guer
ard and Wilfred Stone, all of the
English Department.
Quarles said there had been no
real adverse reaction to their pro
test. “Some people laugh, but
that’s about all.” Ho added that
one person had signed the petition
with the words “Communist in
spired.”
QUARLES noted “We were all
shocked” when the Russians set
off the giant bomb yesterday. He
explained that while the protest
and petition obviously wouldn’t
prod Khrushchev or Kennedy to
halt immediately all nuclear test
ing, the group still felt it was
vital for individuals to indicate
publicly their stand against nu
clear testing in the atmosphere.
“The value is in the publicity,”
he said.

About 25 persons spread out on
the library lawn last night to .loin
the four original protesters. Sev
eral women students planned to
stay until shortly after 2 a.m. to
day and then return at 6 this
morning with coffee for those
who planned to sleep out in a
varied assortment of sleeping
bags, parkas and blankets.
A HALLOWEEN pumpkin with
a candle inside cast a flickering
light over several students study
ing for midterms, while other stu
dents strummed a guitar or lap
ped a bongo drum.
At one point early in the eve
ning two women came up and told
Quarles “We came to express our
appreciation for what you are do
ing.” They also signed the peti
tion.

STUDENT groups at Cal and
San Francisco State also are pro

armbands distributed to those

The Berkeley protest is support

UC protest was originally spon

political organization. But when
university officials ordered
SLATE to conduct the vigil off
campus, the organization with
drew its sponsorship and mem
bers are participating as individu-
