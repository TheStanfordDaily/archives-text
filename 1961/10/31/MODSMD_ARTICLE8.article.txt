# Two Write-in Nominees Join Yell Leader Race
## 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
Responding to the widespread student dissatisfaction with the
present candidates for head yell leader, Roger Solquist and Glen
Odell announced themselves as write-in candidates for the position
yesterday. Solquist, a junior ATO, and Odell, a junior Delta Chi,
both have stated their preference for yell leading aimed at boosting

spirit rather than expressing
crude comments.
Solquist, who is director of card
stunts for the Rally Com, said,
“As was evident at the game Sat
urday and the rally Friday, there
is no real choice among the pres
ent yell leader candidates. The
goal of yell leading has become a
matter of seeing who can be the
biggest clown. People have now
used grossity as a substitute for
team support.”

HE CONTINUED, “This is not
what the student body wants. The
purpose of yells should be to sup
port the team and build spirit.”
Solquist had previously consid
ered running for head yell leader,
but declined the nomination. He
now feels “fairly confident” of
being able to win on the write-in
ticket.

Odell also expressed displeasure
at the present campaign. “After
observing the candidates for head
yell leader at last weekend’s rally
and game, I feel that they are
using the wrong approach. The
whole theme of the campaigns
thus far sems to be one of imma
ture gratification of adolescent
desires to say nasty things in
front of lots of girls and grown
ups.”

ODELL further stated, “Con
trary to popular opinion, a head
yell leader is not a mouthpiece
for the Stanford grossities we all
love so well, but rather is just
what the title implies. He is, in
deed to be a vehement and dex
terious leader of audiographic
morale. And that is just what I
propose to be.”

Among those dissatisfied with
the present candidates is the In
dian Mascot, Prince Lightfoot,
who expressed his displeasure to
Stanford band members, accord
ing to Bob Korten, drum major.
Other evidence of the student
dissatisfaction includes the root
ers’ negative reaction to the can
didates at the UCLA game and the
letters to The Daily, many of
which have not yet been printed
because of lack of space.

for the Stanford grossities we all
love so well, but rather is just
what the title implies. He is, in
deed to be a vehement and dex
terious leader of audiographic
morale. And that is just what I
propose to be.”

Among those dissatisfied with
the present candidates is the In
dian Mascot, Prince Lightfoot,
who expressed his displeasure to
Stanford band members, accord
ing to Bob Korten, drum major.
Other evidence of the student
dissatisfaction includes the root
ers’ negative reaction to the can
didates at the UCLA game and the
letters to The Daily, many of
which have not yet been printed
because of lack of space.
Responding to the widespread student dissatisfaction with the
present candidates for head yell leader, Roger Solquist and Glen
Odell announced themselves as write-in candidates for the position
yesterday. Solquist, a junior ATO, and Odell, a junior Delta Chi,
both have stated their preference for yell leading aimed at boosting

spirit rather than expressing
crude comments.
Solquist, who is director of card
stunts for the Rally Com, said,
“As was evident at the game Sat
urday and the rally Friday, there
is no real choice among the pres
ent yell leader candidates. The
goal of yell leading has become a
matter of seeing who can be the
biggest clown. People have now
used grossity as a substitute for
team support.”

HE CONTINUED, “This is not
what the student body wants. The
purpose of yells should be to sup
port the team and build spirit.”
Solquist had previously consid
ered running for head yell leader,
but declined the nomination. He
now feels “fairly confident” of
being able to win on the write-in
ticket.

Odell also expressed displeasure
at the present campaign. “After
observing the candidates for head
yell leader at last weekend’s rally
and game, I feel that they are
using the wrong approach. The
whole theme of the campaigns
thus far sems to be one of imma
ture gratification of adolescent
desires to say nasty things in
front of lots of girls and grown
ups.”

ODELL further stated, “Con
trary to popular opinion, a head
yell leader is not a mouthpiece
for the Stanford grossities we all
love so well, but rather is just
what the title implies. He is, in
deed to be a vehement and dex
terious leader of audiographic
morale. And that is just what I
propose to be.”
