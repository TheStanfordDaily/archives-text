HUSBANDS, ANYONE?
It lias been alleged that coeds go to college for the sole purpose
of finding husbands. 'This is, of course, an infamous canard, and
I give fair warning that, small and spongy as I am, anybody
who says such a dastardly thing when I am around had better
be prepared for a sound thrashing!
CJirls go to college for precisely the same reasons as men do:
to broaden their horizons, to lengthen their vistas, to drink at
the fount of wisdom. But, if, by pure chance, while a girt is
engaged in these meritorious pursuits, a likely looking husband
should pop into view, why, what's wrong with that? Eh? What’s
wrong with that?
The question now arises, what should a girl look for in a
husband. A great deal has been written on this subject. Some
say character is most important, some say background, some
say appearance, some say education. All are wrong.
The most important thing—bar none—in a husband is health.
Though he be handsome as Apollo and rich as Midas, what good
is he if he just lays around all day accumulating bedsores?
The very first thing to do upon meeting a man is to make
sure he is sound of wind and limb. Before he has a chance to
sweet-talk you, slap a thermometer in his mouth, roll hack his
eyelids, yank out his tongue, rap his patella, palpate his thorax,
ask him to straighten out a horseshoe with his teeth. If he fails
these simple tests, phone for an ambulance and go on to the
next prospect.
If, however, he turns out to be physically fit, proceed to the
second most important requirement in a husband. I refer to a
sense of humor.
A man who can’t take a joke is a man to be avoided. There
are several simple tests to find out whether your prospect cun
take a joke or not. You can, for example, slash his tires. Or burn
his “Mad” comics. Or steal his switchblade. Or turn loose his
pet raccoon. Or shave his head.
After each of these good-natured pranks, laugh gaily and
shout “April Fool! If he replies, “But this is February nine
teenth,” or something equally churlish, cross him off your list
and give thanks you found out in time.
But if he laughs silverly and calls you “Little Minx!” put
him to the next test. Find out whether he is kindly.

The quickest way to ascertain his kindliness is, of course, to
look at the cigarette he smokes. Is it mild? Is it clement? Is it
humane? Does it minister tenderly to the psyche? Docs it
coddle the synapses? Is it a good companion? Is it genial? Is
it bright and friendly and filtered and full of dulcet pleasure
from cockcrow till the heart of darkness?
Is it, in short, Marlboro?
If Marlboro it be, then clasp the man to your bosom with
hoops of steel, for you may be sure that lie is kindly as a sum
mer breeze, kindly as a mother’s kiss, kindly to his very marrow.
And now, having found a man who is kindly and healthy
and blessed with a sense of humor, the only thing that remains
is to make sure he will always earn a handsome living. That,
fortunately, is easy, .lust enroll him in engineering.
Joining Marlboro in bringing you Ibis column throughout

CJirls go to college for precisely the same reasons as men do:
to broaden their horizons, to lengthen their vistas, to drink at
the fount of wisdom. But, if, by pure chance, while a girt is

should pop into view, why, what's wrong with that? Eh? What’s
wrong with that?
The question now arises, what should a girl look for in a
husband. A great deal has been written on this subject. Some

The most important thing—bar none—in a husband is health.
Though he be handsome as Apollo and rich as Midas, what good
is he if he just lays around all day accumulating bedsores?
The very first thing to do upon meeting a man is to make
sure he is sound of wind and limb. Before he has a chance to
sweet-talk you, slap a thermometer in his mouth, roll hack his
eyelids, yank out his tongue, rap his patella, palpate his thorax,
ask him to straighten out a horseshoe with his teeth. If he fails
these simple tests, phone for an ambulance and go on to the
next prospect.
If, however, he turns out to be physically fit, proceed to the
second most important requirement in a husband. I refer to a
sense of humor.
A man who can’t take a joke is a man to be avoided. There
are several simple tests to find out whether your prospect cun
take a joke or not. You can, for example, slash his tires. Or burn
his “Mad” comics. Or steal his switchblade. Or turn loose his
pet raccoon. Or shave his head.
After each of these good-natured pranks, laugh gaily and
shout “April Fool! If he replies, “But this is February nine
teenth,” or something equally churlish, cross him off your list
and give thanks you found out in time.
But if he laughs silverly and calls you “Little Minx!” put
him to the next test. Find out whether he is kindly.

The quickest way to ascertain his kindliness is, of course, to
look at the cigarette he smokes. Is it mild? Is it clement? Is it

If Marlboro it be, then clasp the man to your bosom with
