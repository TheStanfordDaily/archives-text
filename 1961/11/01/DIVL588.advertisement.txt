Here’s the story, man. This swinging Sprite
will go to some guy or gal right here on cam
pus. All other colleges are like in Outsville.
Get the picture, get the odds? This is one
deal you’ve got to get in on.
First thing to do, get your hands on a Regis
tration Envelope, which gives you the easy
Giveaway Rules. You’ll find Registration
Envelopes everywhere- all around campus
and in your local smoke shops. Our Liggett
& Myers Campus Rep has stacks of them,
too you’ll catch him making the scene in
his Grand Prix Sprite, just like the one
you’ll maybe win.
Next, you take a little quiz. It’s printed light
on the envelope, see, it’s about sports cars
SOMEONE AT
STANFORD
WILL WIN-LIKE YOU?
and you can do it in like 47 seconds. Then
smoke 5 wonderful packs of Chesterfields
or L&M’s (or, if you’re a menthol man,
Oasis), tear the bottom panels of all 5 packs,
tuck them in the envelope, sign your name
and mail it. Or you can send substitutes (see
rules). Got it?
Now comes the pay-off! If you pass the quiz
you’ll receive in the mail a Grand Prix
License Plate. It’s serialized. Hang on to it,
because this is it! Your serial number may
he the one the electronic brain selects...
that might put you like behind the wheel of
that jazzy Sprite!
Enter incessantly! The more Grand Prix
License Plates you collect, the better your
odds will be. Entries accepted till April 1,
1962—the winner will he announced on or
about May I, 19G2; so stay with it! Keep
smoking those wonderful Chesterfield, L&M
or Oasis cigarettes (or drawing those sub
stitutes if you want to-be a square). Keep
trying! Win, man!
So go! Get started! There’s going to be a
new 'O2 Sprite on campus soon and you
might as well jingle the keys to it in your
jeans... right?
GET WITH THE GRAND PRIX...ENTER TODAY, ENTER INCESSANTLY!

Here’s the story, man. This swinging Sprite
will go to some guy or gal right here on cam
pus. All other colleges are like in Outsville.
Get the picture, get the odds? This is one
deal you’ve got to get in on.
First thing to do, get your hands on a Regis
tration Envelope, which gives you the easy
Giveaway Rules. You’ll find Registration
Envelopes everywhere- all around campus
and in your local smoke shops. Our Liggett
& Myers Campus Rep has stacks of them,
too you’ll catch him making the scene in
his Grand Prix Sprite, just like the one
you’ll maybe win.
Next, you take a little quiz. It’s printed light
on the envelope, see, it’s about sports cars
SOMEONE AT
STANFORD
WILL WIN-LIKE YOU?
and you can do it in like 47 seconds. Then
smoke 5 wonderful packs of Chesterfields
or L&M’s (or, if you’re a menthol man,
Oasis), tear the bottom panels of all 5 packs,
tuck them in the envelope, sign your name
and mail it. Or you can send substitutes (see
rules). Got it?
Now comes the pay-off! If you pass the quiz
you’ll receive in the mail a Grand Prix
License Plate. It’s serialized. Hang on to it,
because this is it! Your serial number may
he the one the electronic brain selects...
that might put you like behind the wheel of
that jazzy Sprite!
Enter incessantly! The more Grand Prix
License Plates you collect, the better your
odds will be. Entries accepted till April 1,
1962—the winner will he announced on or
about May I, 19G2; so stay with it! Keep
smoking those wonderful Chesterfield, L&M
or Oasis cigarettes (or drawing those sub
stitutes if you want to-be a square). Keep
trying! Win, man!
So go! Get started! There’s going to be a
new 'O2 Sprite on campus soon and you
might as well jingle the keys to it in your
jeans... right?
GET WITH THE GRAND PRIX...ENTER TODAY, ENTER INCESSANTLY!
