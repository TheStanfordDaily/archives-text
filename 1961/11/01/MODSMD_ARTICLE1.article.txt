# Nobel Prize Winner Said to Portray Love

### JUDY SKLAR Associate Editor 
Nobel prize winner Ivo Andric, born into an Austrian-ruled
Bosnia torn by intolerance and oppression, emerged from World
War II as a writer of deep tolerance and love for humanity, Vladi
mir Dedijer said last night.
In complex Bosnia, Andric finds a dark, complex world where

'individual fate is determined by
disturbances from the far away
past, the professor of political
science a! Oxford and Manchester
said.
ANDRIC received the Nobel
prize in literature last week, the
! first Nobel award ever to go to
a Yugoslavian.
Dedijer said that Andric writes
“poetical psychoanalysis,” that
he penetrates to psychological
regions never reached before. He
stressed the universality of his
work.

Andric’s writing is the result
of an historic Bosnian conflict
and fusion of east and west which
Dedijer traced hack to the begin
ning of Christianity.

ANDRIC’S short stories are re
alistic and structured in the clas
sical western tradition, but their
substance is completely Oriental,
Dedijer said.
He has an oral way of telling a
story: there are no fixed events.
Everything is in a moment.
Dedijer noted a complete lack
of any European types. There are
no triangles, no tears, no heroes.
The important characters are all
men; women exist only as “oil
on the fire of men’s lust.”
Dedijer said that ho thought
Andric’s best contribution was
his portrayal of this wild lust for
women in men of the Moslem
type.
ALL OF his works are charac
terized by imagination and love
of adventure, rather than thought
or reason.
Andric’s ripest work, his novel
“The Bridge on the River Drina,”
is a chronicle of passing time at
the bridge which unites Bosnia
and Serbia and symbolizes the
struggles and suffering of the
Serbs, Dedijer said. It is one of
three novels published immedi
ately after the war.

Andric was an angry young
man of his day, Dedijer noted, a
rebel against both the Austrians
and the realities of Bosnian life.
Although he was a member of
the circle of terrorists who assas
sinated Archduke Francis Ferdi
nand in 1914, he did not consider
himself a revolutionary. At this
time he wrote in a journal, “I am
not one of them.”

HE SPENT three years in
prison during the war, during
which he translated Kierkegaard
into Serbo-Croat. Dedijer feels
that Kierkegaard confirmed An
dric’s belief in tolerance.

Bosnia, the setting of Andric's
most powerful work, is the line
of demarcation between both east
and west and Greek Orthodox
and Roman Catholic.

The perpetual struggle of the
Balkan area, under four centuries
of Turkish domination and after
ward, has been both national and
religious.
Dedijer. who will remain as a
visiting lecturer for two weeks,
is a personal friend of Andric’s.
