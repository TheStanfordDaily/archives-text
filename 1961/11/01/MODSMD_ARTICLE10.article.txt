New waves of shock and anger
swept the free world yesterday
against Russia’s explosion of its
super nuclear bomb. Anti-Soviet
demonstrations broke out in Brit
ain, Norway, Italy and Japan.
WORLD indignation increased
when Premier Nikita S. Khrush
chev told Communist leaders
yesterday in Moscow Russian
scientists made a "mistake” and
joked that the explosion was big
ger than the 50 megaton blast
they had planned.
In Tokyo, 200 snake-dancing
ultra-leftist Zengakurn federation
students snake-danced outside the
Soviet Embassy in noisy protest
against the explosion their first
anti-Russian moves. The Rus
sians ignored them.
IN ROME, police clashed vio
lently with about 1,000 students
demonstrating near the Soviet
Embassy. There were shouts of
"death to Khrushchev” and "down
with Italian Communists." They
attempted to surge through a po
lice cordon into the embassy but
were turned back by police.
