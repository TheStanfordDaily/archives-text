# Bike Riders Had Better Wake Up
## 
### 
Life will be somewhat more relaxed and safer for Stanford
pedestrians from now on as a result of the University Safety Com
mittee’s closing the iron gate across from the library on Quad.
We hope it stays padlocked forever, as the safety problem cre
ated was a hazardous one for both bike rider and those hoofing it.
Someone was bound to get hurt, perhaps seriously, with pedestrians
and bicyclists fighting for the right-of-way at that spot. The gate
was closed in 1959 for that very reason.
Happy as we are at this progress, however, we still must point
out the incredible carelessness displayed by Stanford’s bike-riding
population. What amazes us is the bike riders are being careless
primarily with their own lives, and it doesn’t seem to bother them.
Maybe they don’t realize it, or perhaps they feel that something in
Mrs. Stanford’s Will prohibits automobiles from running down bi
cycle riders, even if by accident.
We think it is time these people woke up to the fact that a very
dangerous traffic problem exists on this campus, despite the best
efforts of the policemen and safety officials. It will not be the mo
torist who is hurt when Stanford has its first serious accident in
volving a bike and a car.
Anyone who observes the mixture of bike riders, cars and pedes
trians during class breaks at such spots as the Physics Corner area,
the intersection at the site of Stern Hall and the “temporary” build
ings or the intersection on the Roble side of Geology Corner, can
not help but be amazed that so far no one lias been hurt seriously.
Someone Up There must be a Stanford grad.
The situation at night is even worse. Bicycle riders may not
realize it, but motorists have a very difficult time seeing bikes at
night, particularly if the bikes aren’t equipped with lights.
Because of the traffic situation Stanford is in, someone is bound
to be hurt—and it very easily could be fatally—before long, unless
Fortune continues to smile on the campus and the law of averages
is suspended. Therefore', it is up to Stanford’s übiquitous bike riders
to start paying attention to the elementary rules of safety—before it’s
too late for someone.
