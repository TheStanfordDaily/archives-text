# MOVIE REVIEW
## Rocco and Brothers' a Film of Major Status 
### DEREK DAVIS 
Brotherly love can get pretty
complicated when there are five
brothers around to practice it.
This fact “Rocco and His Broth
ers” (at the Fine Arts) firmly
establishes, though the oblique
moralizing drawn from it may
not be so easy to accept.
Luchino Visconti, unlike his
leading Italian compatriots, has
clung more or loss to the basic
concept of a plotted story within
which to develop his characters.
Few, if any, have made a better
go of it. The Parondi family are
allowed to struggle and stumble
their way through Milan with al
most no interference from cam
era or writer, assuming reality
through the directness and care
lessness of their actions.
The characters, as we see them,
are near-perfect in their solidity
and implications. Rocco, who be
gins the film as a gawking hick,
usually standing behind one or
two of his more noteworthy sib
lings, slowly emerges as the pri
mary force of good, a saintly, un
compromising good which is yet
rooted in his tangible humanity,
rather than in an aura of other
worldliness.
SIMON, THE black sheep, also
starts on a fairly nondescript
level, only to descend to the ap
palling depths of degeneracy
which somehow never go beyond
the believable.
And Nadia, in many ways the
most remarkable creation of the
lot, is a prostitute who wouldn’t
know a heart of gold from a sil
ver-plated tea service. She is sim
ply a human being whose profes
sion is partly necessity, partly a
growth nurtured by disgusted re
bellion and a need for escape.
These, however, are only the
characters as we see them. Judg
ing from the conclusions which
Visconti and (if the credits are
to be believed) his incredible
army of co-creators draw, there
is much rationale behind their
present state which does not meet
the eye. This is probably the only
weak point in an otherwise super
lative construction.
SIMON, BY circumstances and
inclination, has become attached
to Nadia near the start of the
film. Through his boxing abilities,
he hopes to become champion and,
it is presumed, maintain his four
brothers and himself (along with
Mama, a magnificent Italian ma
triarch) when they are evicted
from their flat.
About this time Rocco is draft
ed and Nadia shipped to prison for
activities unbecoming a street
walker. When Rocco returns, he
finds Simon well on the road to
dissipation and Nadia in the
proper mood to be loved and com
forted by someone as good as
Rocco.

What is puzzling is just why

Simon should go downhill so
rapidly. He was never particu
larly likable, and the only imme
diate reason sems to be that he is
a Grade A louse, a supposition
which further events reinforce.
YET ROCCO sees him as a vic
tim of circumstances i the major
circumstance being Rocco’s steal
ing of Nadia), while the final re
marks of brother Giro (presum
ably speaking for the authors)
suggest an almost social guilt.
Unfortunately for the audience,
there just isn’t enough informa
tion to make either of these ex
planations tenable.
After Simon turns his disgust at
losing an important fight and his
dissatisfaction with the way he is
treated by family and friends into
open, physical violence against
Rocco, in one of the most horri
fying and overwhelming scenes
of brute hatred over filmed, we
find Rocco looking to see how he
can steer his brother back to the
path of righteousness. We may
admire Rocco, but we must also
see him as a full-blooded sap,
whose energies are wasted.

Cinematically, Vis conti has
turned in a masterpiece. His cam
era work is unselfconscious in a
manner seldom seen today, yet it
is never still for a moment.
THE UNEVEN alternation of
tricky mood shots for action and
unswerving close-ups for dia
logue (one of Bergman’s pitfalls)
is overthrown in favor of a steady
progression of short hunks of
reality, beautifully edited to give
the effect of total cognizance of
the surroundings, without having
the camera run roughshod over
the scene. Dialogue is no longer
the isolated give and take between
two heads, but an intricate de
velopment from and expression of
the total physical and mental en
vironment.

The acting of Alan Delon as
Rocco, Renato Salvatori as Simon
and Grecian star Katina Paxinou
as Mama, is uniformly excellent,
but it is Annie Girardot, the way
ward Nadia, who captures the at
tention. She has something of the
sensual magnetism of Melina
Mercouri and the mature force of
Simone Signoret, along with about
the best native acting prowess ex
tant.
SHE IS PERHAPS the first
film prostitute who has managed
to maintain all the proper char
acteristics of her vocation
throughout her performance, yet
who can make you forget immedi
ately that she is anything other
than a person who happens to be
living on the screen at that pre
cise moment.

“Rocco” rings true as a chron
icle of people and of what makes
a family tick. Most of all it shows
that a film which is just a film,
a plotted film at that, can still
achieve major status.
