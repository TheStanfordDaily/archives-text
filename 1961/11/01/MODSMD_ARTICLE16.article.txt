THE ELECTION
Editor, The Daily:
In view of the improper elec
tioneering and disrespect to can
didates present in the primary
election campaigns, I feel it very
important that Stanford students
demonstrate their responsibility
and interest to their student gov
ernment by voting wisely in to
day and tomorrow’s primary elec
tions.
An intelligent vote will not only
help insure that our student gov
ernment operates the way we
would have it operate, but demon
strates responsible execution of
every educated citizen’s duty to
uphold the representative powers
at his command.
Bob Sayler
ASSU President
Editor, The Daily:
Certainly the race for head yell
leader this year is confusing—in
fact it borders on the ridiculous
and disgusting.
The fault, however, does not lie
entirely with the candidates, or at
least not with all the candidates.
Other factors are:
1. The panic sown by the pros
pect of having a female head yell
leader brought forth a surplus of
male candidates, many of them
crude, trivial, or absurd. This
mass of foolishness has obscured
from view the serious candidates.
2. Rain Friday night prevented
the candidates from giving a full
presentation at a full-sized rally.
3. Lack of time and a faulty
P.A. system at the game Satur
day again prevented a good pre

sentation.
For these reasons the serious
candidates have had little oppor
tunity to be seen or heard, yet
they do in fact exist.
I hope, therefore, that the
voters will carefully investigate
the qualifications of the original
candidates, before they leap into
the unknown by writing in a
name that is no more than a
name.

BOMB PROTEST
Editor, The Daily:
Having observed the “Sing
Along With Krishna Menon” in
progress on the Library lawn,
may I ask why the participants
are presenting two petitions?
Personally, it is galling to hear
it implied that the U.S.-Soviet
arms race is partly our fault. If
the Soviet Union persists in test
ing, we must do likewise—and if
underground tests are not pro
viding the information we re
quire, then we must resume tests
in the atmosphere if this is the
only way such information can be
secured.

We have reached a stage in the
escalation of the cold war where
further retreat would be immoral,
and 1 submit that there are evils
greater than thermo-nuclear war,
one being the victory of commu
nism.

What we desperately need is a
realistic orientation between the
two lunatic poles as represented

by the John Birch Society on one
extreme and the “better-Red-than
dead” group on the other.
