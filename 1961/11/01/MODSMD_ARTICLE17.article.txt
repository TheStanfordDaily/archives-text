# TOP TEN RATINGS
## Law Ranked Top Mural Team 
### Jim Torre 
Law School I has been selected
as the top University intramural
football squad by the Daily sports
staff with the aid of assistant
intramural director Bill Glennon.
The team is paced by the marks
manship of quarterback Terry
Farina and the receiving of end
Gary Vanderweghe, Farina’s fa
vorite target.
The graduate students have
compiled a 3-0 record which is
due to the successful air game
and the defensive work of Van
derweghe and company.
In the No. 2 position is the
top fraternity, SAE (3-0).
Among the squad’s laurels is a
12-7 win over the fourth-ranked
Phi Kapps.
The Theta Xi’s, the third se
lected team, picked up their
fourth victory yesterday by de
feating the seventh-ranked Zetes,
12-6.
QUARTERBACK Pete Tracy is

among the league’s top quarter
backs and the sparkplug in the
Zete victory campaign.
The squad uses the platoon sys
tem, and has speed in flanker
Mike Mclntyre to gain the neces
sary yardage.
Following in order behind the
top three squads are the Phi
Kaps (3-1), the Phi Delts and
the Theta Chis, both 3-0.
THE ZETES, once ranked
fourth, dropped to seventh be
cause of their loss to SAE. The
squad, however, is yet to be
matched in organization.
The Phi Sigs (2-1 1 would have
a higher ranking than eighth, but
their loss to the fourth place Phi
Delts prevented it.
Rounding out the top ten are
SRAC (3-0) and Beta Biz.
SRAC is the league’s fastest
squad, and has a win over Bela
Biz.
ATO deserves honorable men
tion, losing one of its contests to
Theta Xi.

LEADING the Wilbur Houses,
thought not recognized among
the top ten, are Rinconada and
Junipero, both with identical 4-1
records. Junipero, however, put
an end to the three-game winning
streak of Rinconada.
Yesterday Rinconada defeated
Otero 13-7, while Junipero
blanked Madera, 19-0.
Capitan (4-0) and Arcos (4-0)
lead the seven eating club squads,
while Sena boasts a 5-0 record,
the best in intramural competi
tion.

ZETE JIM EPSTEIN snares a pass despite determined defensive effort by Pete Jackson (67) and Dean
Banks, Theta Xi won (1 2-6) on the passing of quarterback Pete Tracy who threw for two touchdowns
Theta Xi is ranked third in the University standings and Zete Psi is seventh.
Law School I has been selected
as the top University intramural
football squad by the Daily sports
staff with the aid of assistant
intramural director Bill Glennon.
The team is paced by the marks
manship of quarterback Terry
Farina and the receiving of end
Gary Vanderweghe, Farina’s fa
vorite target.
The graduate students have
compiled a 3-0 record which is
due to the successful air game
and the defensive work of Van
derweghe and company.
In the No. 2 position is the
top fraternity, SAE (3-0).
Among the squad’s laurels is a
12-7 win over the fourth-ranked
Phi Kapps.
The Theta Xi’s, the third se
lected team, picked up their
fourth victory yesterday by de
feating the seventh-ranked Zetes,
12-6.
QUARTERBACK Pete Tracy is

among the league’s top quarter
backs and the sparkplug in the
Zete victory campaign.
The squad uses the platoon sys
tem, and has speed in flanker
Mike Mclntyre to gain the neces
sary yardage.
Following in order behind the
top three squads are the Phi
Kaps (3-1), the Phi Delts and
the Theta Chis, both 3-0.
THE ZETES, once ranked
fourth, dropped to seventh be
cause of their loss to SAE. The
squad, however, is yet to be
matched in organization.
The Phi Sigs (2-1 1 would have
a higher ranking than eighth, but
their loss to the fourth place Phi
Delts prevented it.
Rounding out the top ten are
SRAC (3-0) and Beta Biz.
SRAC is the league’s fastest
squad, and has a win over Bela
Biz.
ATO deserves honorable men
tion, losing one of its contests to
Theta Xi.

LEADING the Wilbur Houses,
thought not recognized among
the top ten, are Rinconada and
Junipero, both with identical 4-1
records. Junipero, however, put
an end to the three-game winning
streak of Rinconada.
Yesterday Rinconada defeated
Otero 13-7, while Junipero
blanked Madera, 19-0.
Capitan (4-0) and Arcos (4-0)
lead the seven eating club squads,
while Sena boasts a 5-0 record,
the best in intramural competi
tion.

ZETE JIM EPSTEIN snares a pass despite determined defensive effort by Pete Jackson (67) and Dean
Banks, Theta Xi won (1 2-6) on the passing of quarterback Pete Tracy who threw for two touchdowns
Theta Xi is ranked third in the University standings and Zete Psi is seventh.
Law School I has been selected
as the top University intramural
football squad by the Daily sports
staff with the aid of assistant
intramural director Bill Glennon.
The team is paced by the marks
manship of quarterback Terry
Farina and the receiving of end
Gary Vanderweghe, Farina’s fa
vorite target.
The graduate students have
compiled a 3-0 record which is
due to the successful air game
and the defensive work of Van
derweghe and company.
In the No. 2 position is the
top fraternity, SAE (3-0).
Among the squad’s laurels is a
12-7 win over the fourth-ranked
Phi Kapps.
The Theta Xi’s, the third se
lected team, picked up their
fourth victory yesterday by de
feating the seventh-ranked Zetes,
12-6.
QUARTERBACK Pete Tracy is

among the league’s top quarter
backs and the sparkplug in the
Zete victory campaign.
The squad uses the platoon sys
tem, and has speed in flanker
Mike Mclntyre to gain the neces
sary yardage.
Following in order behind the
top three squads are the Phi
Kaps (3-1), the Phi Delts and
the Theta Chis, both 3-0.
THE ZETES, once ranked
fourth, dropped to seventh be
cause of their loss to SAE. The
squad, however, is yet to be
matched in organization.
The Phi Sigs (2-1 1 would have
a higher ranking than eighth, but
their loss to the fourth place Phi
Delts prevented it.
Rounding out the top ten are
SRAC (3-0) and Beta Biz.
SRAC is the league’s fastest
squad, and has a win over Bela
Biz.
ATO deserves honorable men
tion, losing one of its contests to
Theta Xi.

LEADING the Wilbur Houses,
thought not recognized among
the top ten, are Rinconada and
Junipero, both with identical 4-1
records. Junipero, however, put
an end to the three-game winning
streak of Rinconada.
Yesterday Rinconada defeated
Otero 13-7, while Junipero
blanked Madera, 19-0.
Capitan (4-0) and Arcos (4-0)
lead the seven eating club squads,
while Sena boasts a 5-0 record,
the best in intramural competi
tion.
