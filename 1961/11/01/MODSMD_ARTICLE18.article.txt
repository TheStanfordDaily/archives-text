# High Riding Webfoots Face Cards Saturday
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
I lie Oregon Webfoots are on the move. They have won two
straight contests to even their season record at 3-3, and are looking
for their third straight when they take on Stanford this Saturday

on the Farm.
The Webfoots have beaten
Washington 7-6 last week.
And Oregon did this without
Mel Renfro who is expected to be
ready to face the Cards.
RENFRO has to be seen to be
believed. He’s played in only one
game this year, having been out
since the first game with a foot
operation. But in that game he
carried the ball seven times for
120 yards, an average of 17 yards
per carry.
With the strong defenses that
both teams possess, some press
box pundits had predicted a score
less tie, but with Renfro in there,
at least Oregon will score.
Stanford quarterback Steve
Thurlow will be out for at least
two more weeks due to illness.
Oregon has a raft of speedy
backs, with or without Renfro.
The only question mark in the
backfield is quarterback, but the
good all-around play of sopho
more Doug Post suggests that he
can do the job. Post has com
pleted 45 per cent of his passes,
for a substantial yardage total.
THE FULLBACK position is
loaded. Duane Cargill and Jim
Josephson are fine blockers and
talented ball carriers. Cargill has
yet to be trapped for a loss, and
has averaged five plus yards a
carry. However Josephson will
start.

ian Jose State, 21-6, and edged

other starting half will be Mike
Gaechter, who is currently aver
aging six yards a carry. Lu Bain
and Ben Brown are swifl ball
toters, and Mickey Bruce is a
valuable defensive back.

The line is Oregon's strong
point. All-Coast tackle Steve Bar
nett, at 252 pounds, leads a line
which averages 209 pounds per
man.

KENT PETERSON and Greg
Willener are Ihe ends. Peterson
is the better pass receiver, while
Willener is rated as the best
blocker among the Oregon ends.

Barnett is a whole line in him
self, but the other tackle, Ron
Snidow, gives the Webfoots an
exceptional sot of tackles. Bar
nett is fast, and when he breaks
in front of a play as the lead
blocker the back is sure to go for
quite a distance. Snidow excells
on defense. Rushing the passer is
his specailty.

Guards Mickey Ording and A1
Weigel are boiler' than average,
although light. Mike Rose and
Bill Del Biaggio are as good as
the starters and will see action.
Center Rich Dixon gave Stan
ford fits last year and is even
better now, since he added 15
pounds and retained his same
good speed.

There are no problems at half
back, with Renfro around. The

MEL RENFRO —The outstanding Oregon sophomore halfback has
been on the injury list since the first game of the season but will
be ready for the Cards this Saturday.
I lie Oregon Webfoots are on the move. They have won two
straight contests to even their season record at 3-3, and are looking
