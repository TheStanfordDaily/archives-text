Steve Eyre
Past experience reveals that
class government has been inef
fective in attempting to develop
class unity and pride. I do not
contend that I can immensely

change this, be
cause, in reali
ty, class spirit
doesn’t develop
merely through
the efforts of
one individual.
In my opin
ion, the prime
purpose of
class govern
ment is to pro
vide opportuni

ties for its
members to get acquainted
through informal social functions.
I advocate an abundance of such
activities hoping the end result
will be class unity.
Steve Eyre

Larry Lang
Thanks to Freshmen’s fervent
desire to participate in hallowed
traditions, i.e., the Quad Wasser
fest, the higher order believes we
bear a stigma. We should consid

er this stigma
a challenge to
prove to all
Stanford we
are capable of
sane enthusi
asm and dy
namic leader
ship.
Words will
not accomplish
this; action
will. If elected,

I believe I am
capable of bearing responsibility
for my class, and of acting in its
best interests in asserting our
leadership and enthusiasm.
Larry Lang

Biff Barker
Everyone has to agree that in
one way or another our class is
outstanding. The people in our
class have the ability to originate
and carry one ideas which will

make this a
m emorable
class.
However, I
believe the pres
ident, no mat
ter how active
his class, must
provide leader
ship by coming
up with a pro
gram of his
own. I could

promise the
world, but instead I put before
you the ten concrete, practical
ideas of my program.

Branner LASSU Reps

Carole Hanson
As a freshman LASSU repre
sentative my goal will he to make
Stafford’s -student government
KNOWN to the freshmen women.
I plan to establish office hours, to

poll opinion
within Branner,
to post a week
-1 y newsletter,
i.e., to be the
voice of every
Branner wom
an.
The issues de
bated will no
longer remain
m y st eriously
detached from

the st u d en t.
Willingly I will participate in
LASSU, striving for mature de
bate on the specific and pertinent
issues which arise.
Carole Hanson

Ann Kovacovich
You Branner girls, please gather
near,
Elections are coming, or so I
hear!
Think hard and long and serious
ly too,
Then vote for the girl to best rep
resent you.

Someone will
go to the
Legislature,
And she must
he a girl who
knows your
nature,
For she’ll cast
the votes
that affect
your reputa
tion,
From F u 11-
Moon Riots

to minor legislation.
Consider well now, and you won’t
regret
In six short months what was a
good bet.
Yes, ask yourself now, ask your
self which,
Then answer your question—it’s
Kovacovich!

Clark Hinderleider
A class government in name
only does not help the class, its
members or its name. To be ef
fective a class government must
be organized and willing to ex

oend effort to
make it the
best.
Here at Stan
ford class gov
ernment is
merely a loose
organization, I
propose, if
elected, to
make our class
government a
workable, effec
tive, and prof

itable idea. I hope to have your
support for president, and to
gether we will make our class, al
ready the largest and most spirit
ed, without parallel.

Sharon Fogleman
Though the duties of freshman
vice president are not clearly de
fined, traditionally this office in
volves planning freshman social
afffairs. This means that the class

Social Calendar
must be kept
up to date and
filled with ac
tivities which
will interest the
entire student
body.
As your vice
p reside qtial
candid ate, I
will not make
grandiose
promises. All I

can honestly say is that I will en
deavor to co-ordinate our social
functions to make you proud of
your part in them.
Sharon Fogleman

David Coombs
In the past the Vice President’s
responsibility has been to promote
social intercourse among the
freshmen. If elected I would do

this job by go
ing one step
further. I would
set up a social
cabinet consist
ing of all the
freshman
houses.
This cabinet
would unify the
Class of 1965
by inviting the
houses to work

together for a
common goal—the betterment of
the spirit of the Class of ’65 and
of Stanford University.
David Coombs

Allan Curr
I believe that each student here
has the responsibility to share his
talents and his acquired knowl
edge with the rest of us. This is
fundamental to my platform, and

it moans that
there is an
enormous pool
of ability and
energy which is
largely untap
ped here.
If we are to
tap it, we must
have a strong
and an efficient
control at the
top. The ideas

and the drive
must come from all of us, hut the
Executive must be able to legis
late quickly and intelligently.
The Executive must have the
organization to avoid red tape and
to act concretely and construc
tively on the measures initiated
by the Brain Trust of ’65. This is
the Executive for which I stand.
