## 
### 
Joe Vittal
This year the freshman class at
Stanford is faced with a great
challenge. We are under attack
from all sides for the activities
which took place at the last Full

Moon ritual.
As the vice
president of the
class, I believe
that I could be
the one to help
the man you
elect president
co-ordinate the
activities of the
class in away
to erase this
mark on our

record and
make the Class of 1965 one to be
well remembered at Stanford for
a long time to come,

This coming week the Class of I
’65 has a great responsibility—

the responsibil
ities of this of

that I can ex
ploit them to
our fullest ad
vantage.

I feel that any candidate for an
office of importance must have
two qualifications: experience and
desire. As president of my class
and treasurer of my student body,
I feel I gained the necessary back
ground for service as vice presi
dent of your class.
With regards to desire, I do not
wish to serve you, but to work
with you to repay those who are
providing the opportunity for us
to take part in the Stanford pro
gram and to provide even more
opportunities for those who are
to follow us.

He has prom
ised if elected

duties in away

because he has

David Fraser
David (Eureka) Fraser doesn’t
have a platform. He’s saving all
his wood for the bonfire. He says f
he’s running for prestige; his c
friends say ties’ running because 1

found it. You 1
can find it too if you shriek for *
Eurek, and vote for David (Eu- {
reka) Fraser for Frosh Vice Pres-
ident.

Carol Callahan
The frosh Vice President should
be a red hot! He (preferably she)
should be able to properly organ
ize committees and carry out all
the necessary details involved in

class functions.
The V. P.,
along with the
President, can
stimulate inter
est in govern
ment and spirit
for such activi
ties as the Big
Game bonfire.
The potential
talent of other
freshman red
hots should be

brought into class activities to dis
tinguish the Class of ’65 from the
often blase upperclassmen.
Carol Callahan

Steve Spain
The Vice President’s principal
duty is the organization of social
activities and the financial proj
ects necessary for their support.
As an officer for several organi

zations, I have
had wide exper
ience i n this
area.
Our major
concern now,
however, is the
d e v e 1 o pment
and mainten
ance of the
class spirit so
vital to the suc
cess of any pro
gram. An ac

tive, industrious government can
promote class unity and spirit.
This is the typo of government I
will provide.

I feel that any candidate for an
office of importance must have
two qualifications: experience and
desire. As president of my class
and treasurer of my student body,
I feel I gained the necessary back
ground for service as vice presi
dent of your class.
With regards to desire, I do not
wish to serve you, but to work
with you to repay those who are
providing the opportunity for us
to take part in the Stanford pro
gram and to provide even more
opportunities for those who are
to follow us.

As an officer for several organi

The frosh Vice President should
be a red hot! He (preferably she)
should be able to properly organ
ize committees and carry out all
the necessary details involved in

class functions.
The V. P.,
along with the
President, can
stimulate inter
est in govern
ment and spirit
for such activi
ties as the Big

The potential
talent of other
freshman red

brought into class activities to dis
tinguish the Class of ’65 from the
often blase upperclassmen.

The Vice President’s principal
duty is the organization of social
activities and the financial proj
ects necessary for their support.
As an officer for several organi

zations, I have
had wide exper
ience i n this
area.
Our major
concern now,
however, is the
d e v e 1 o pment
and mainten
ance of the
class spirit so
vital to the suc
cess of any pro
gram. An ac

tive, industrious government can
promote class unity and spirit.
This is the typo of government I
will provide.

co-ordinate the
activities of the

to erase this
mark on our

record and
make the Class of 1965 one to be
well remembered at Stanford for
a long time to come,

I feel that any candidate for an
office of importance must have
two qualifications: experience and
desire. As president of my class
and treasurer of my student body,
I feel I gained the necessary back
ground for service as vice presi
dent of your class.
With regards to desire, I do not
wish to serve you, but to work
with you to repay those who are
providing the opportunity for us
to take part in the Stanford pro
gram and to provide even more
opportunities for those who are
to follow us.
