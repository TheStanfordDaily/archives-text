With an all-male rooting sec
tion, there are bound to he sug- t
gostive yells. After an, four thou- 1
sand hairy chested house apes £
could not even repeat a Mother
Goose rhyme without giving it
some sort of sexual connotation.
Nevertheless, there is a dividing
line tfine though it may be) be
tween humor and obscenity. I in
tend to stay on the humor side of
that line. It’s as simple as that. 1

Being a Stanford student is a
many faceted thing. It ranges
from academic excellence to social
competence. One of these facets
is pride in our. school - school
spirit.
School spirit at an athletic con
test is spontaneous and does not
have to be contrived. For this
reason the job of a head yell
leader is questionable. He cannot
give the students school spirit,
but what he can do is bring forth
this spirit and give it direction.
In my mind the man best quali
fied to do this is the person who
can do this in an original and
diversified manner.
John “Cannonball’ McGregor

Fred Richards
Let’s look at the record.
1. Fred Richard’s campaign is
undeniably the most original. As
F.S.R., the mysterious Mexican,
Fred rode about on his burro in
authentic Mexican costume with
a continual line of good jokes.
There’s no doubt that Fred is tops
in novel ideas and originality.
2. Fred’s humor has proved to
be hilarious without being ob
scene.
3. A tough guy, Fred has an un
breakable spirit. Nothing can get
him down. Here is a natural lead
er.
4. Fred knows that rooters en
joy humor but that the team
often needs a serious uplift. He’s
got the sense to know when hi
larity must yield to seriousness.
The candidate with originality,
respect for decency, unbreakable
spirit, a serious approach, and
common sense is Fred S. Rich
ards. He merits your vote.

The purpose of a yell leader
is to channel the spirit of the
rooters to the team. At Stanford
the method of accomplishing this
purpose has been gross humor. A
little gross humor is acceptable,
but a yell leader should not al
ways be a comedian because he
then becomes the show instead of
the team. Spirit is on the rise at
Stanford because of the new ele
ment of winning teams has been
added. I believe that a yell leader
should know something about the
games being played.
I think one could do better by
leading something other than a
“score” yell when your team has
the ball on its own 35-yard line.
So for the right yell at the right
time, go all the way with P.C.J.

Jim Nolfi
Ignoble students of Stanford:
Harken unto me and know that I
am Nolfi, son of Bacchus, son of
Dionysius, and second cousin to
Minerva twice removed.
I am a candidate for the god of
Good Cheer, exponent of the (The
Daily doesn’t use this word any
more, but it is a synonym for
joke), and as those before me
have so basely put it, Head Yell
Leader.
I know who opposes me. I have
names! If any obstacle is placed
in my path, my men, strategically
hidden in the Stanford Hills will
release 69,427 orangutans, hor
rible, misshapen, disease-ridden
beasts, who will make their way,
twisting, crawling, limping, grov
eling, through all parts of the
campus spreading leprosy, con
sumption, rickets, yaws, beri-beri,
elephantitus, and all manner of
hideous tropical diseases.
DO NOT OPPOSE ME IN MY
MOVE FOR POWER-it is Eth
nic Destiny—lt is the revival of
the Roman Empire at the height
of the Decline. Soon hanging from
Hoover Tower, my victory banner
shall read (in (he words of the im
mortal Caesar) IT’S-A NOLFI
TIME.

Tired of traditional yells? I pro
■ pose to institute the noisiest, most
• feared, and blood-thirsty rooting
. section in the world. Risking my
life, I dipped back into the old
family secrets and discovered my
i relation to DRACULA, the most
• feared yell leader of all times.
. I feel that in proper costume
and with proper spirits I will in
still such a fear and taste for
blood into the rooters and team
1 alike, that the opposition will run
i to the safety of garlic patches
rather than face certain death on
our playing fields.
