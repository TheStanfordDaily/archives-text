I promise not a bigger, better
America and the abolishment of
(insert here
any organization against which
you feel particular rancor—e.g.,

C o m m u nists,
Cal, Civ depart
ment), but a
bettor-informed
Roble and the
annihilation of
ignorance.
The position
of freshmen is
presently, 1 be
lieve, "one of
growing aware
ness. We can

not contribute
much to Stanford yet because we
are not familiar with her prob
lems. If elected, I will consider it
my privilege to tell Roble girls
about their legislature and to car
ry their opinions to it,

The L.A.S.S.U. representatives
from Wilbur, Branner, and Roble
are the freshman class’ closest
link with all-campus government.
Active participation on the part

of these repre
sentatives will
mean a strong
freshman voice
in student af
fairs.
To maintain
this active con
tact and partic
ipation I would,
among other
things, set up a
box for student

legislative ideas
and publish a complete report of
all L.A.S.S.U. proceedings. A close
’ association between students and
their representatives is of utmost
necessity in maintaining a realis
tic contact with campus govern
ment.

A LASSU representative incurs
heavy responsibility for dynamic
channeling of the Legislature’s
power. For this reason, as candi
date for Roble representative, I

would wish to
be elected not
because of a
clever slogan or
attractive
promise, but
rather because
I pledge the fol
lowing:
To subordi
nate my per
s on a 1 opinion
and wholeheart
edly back the

majority opinion of Roble; to keep
alw'ays as a basic purpose the im
mediate and long-range better
ment of Stanford.

Hi! I’m Kitty Matthews and I’m
seeking your support in my cam
paign for Roble Representative
to L.A.S.S.U. This position re
quires one person capable of ex

pressing the
wishes of many
but able to pre
sent worthy
ideas of her
own too.
As social
chairman of my
corridor, I’ve
had some ex
perience in do
ing this. M y
principal quali
fication, how

ever, is a sincere desire to serve
Roble and Stanford, and this I
would do diligently if elected.
