# 4 Roble Girls Candidates for LASSU Post

### 
Pat Bush
I promise not a bigger, better
America and the abolishment of
(insert here
any organization against which
you feel particular rancor—e.g.,

C o m m u nists,
Cal, Civ depart
ment), but a
bettor-informed
Roble and the
annihilation of
ignorance.
The position
of freshmen is
presently, 1 be
lieve, "one of
growing aware
ness. We can

not contribute
much to Stanford yet because we
are not familiar with her prob
lems. If elected, I will consider it
my privilege to tell Roble girls
about their legislature and to car
ry their opinions to it,
Pat Bush

Anne Osborn
The L.A.S.S.U. representatives
from Wilbur, Branner, and Roble
are the freshman class’ closest
link with all-campus government.
Active participation on the part

of these repre
sentatives will
mean a strong
freshman voice
in student af
fairs.
To maintain
this active con
tact and partic
ipation I would,
among other
things, set up a
box for student

legislative ideas
and publish a complete report of
all L.A.S.S.U. proceedings. A close
’ association between students and
their representatives is of utmost
necessity in maintaining a realis
tic contact with campus govern
ment.
i Anne Osborn

Ann Evans
A LASSU representative incurs
heavy responsibility for dynamic
channeling of the Legislature’s
power. For this reason, as candi
date for Roble representative, I

would wish to
be elected not
because of a
clever slogan or
attractive
promise, but
rather because
I pledge the fol
lowing:
To subordi
nate my per
s on a 1 opinion
and wholeheart
edly back the

majority opinion of Roble; to keep
alw'ays as a basic purpose the im
mediate and long-range better
ment of Stanford.

Hi! I’m Kitty Matthews and I’m
seeking your support in my cam
paign for Roble Representative
to L.A.S.S.U. This position re
quires one person capable of ex

pressing the
wishes of many
but able to pre
sent worthy
ideas of her
own too.
As social
chairman of my
corridor, I’ve
had some ex
perience in do
ing this. M y
principal quali
fication, how

ever, is a sincere desire to serve
Roble and Stanford, and this I
would do diligently if elected.

i want the opportunity to in
ject some real insanity into the
wretched drabness of student gov
ernment as sex coordinator of the
freshman class, what the crew of

’65 needs is to
indoctrinate a
tradition of bla
tant, inescap
able. irrespres
ible, but harm
less exubor
mce.
there is time
enough for the
false maturity
and dignity of
worldly -wise
sophomores. i

can positively certify that i would
be a most unpredictible officer
with most unpredictible, unbe j
lievable, and unconventional ideas,
i twist.

As vice president of the Class
of ’65 I would create a close re
lationship between class members
and their officers and bring about
class unity This might be done

through a sys
tem of co-ed
dining, an in
ter - residence
c o m p e t ition
day. and broad
re presentation
on the execu
tive committee.
Above all I
would try to
give any inter
ested Fees li
man the oppor

tunity of becoming a working
member of his class government.
I feel it is not the job of class
officers to dictate the government
of the class, but rather to repre
sent those who elected them and
work for their aims,
Joe Dennin

Larry Tesler
The administration is seriously
considering coed dining and hous
ing in the new undergrad halis.
I The plan’s fulfillment depends on
the “integrated dining” experi

ments proceed
ing in freshman
dorms. I strong
ly support this
plan. If you
want it investi
gated. back my
platform in the
election.
To raise the
voices of the
whole Universi
ty, Start at the
Bottom and

j Work Up. We freshmen are the
bottom. Unleash Stanford spirit

; The main purpose of a fresh
| man class Vice President is to help
coordinate social events, as he aids
the president in planning a suc
cessful social program.

My ideas for
activities i n
clude class pat
ties at the
beach, in the
hills, and on
campus: a
weekly recrea
ti on night
(dancing, re
f re s h m e nts,
etc.); a bitchin’
I class reunion;
a big-game bon

fire straight from the abyss (Cal
buildings, Pali High saboteurs,
etc. i
If hard work makes for success,
I can promise you if I am elected,
the Class of '65 will enjoy a pace
setting year. Gary Vollstedt
