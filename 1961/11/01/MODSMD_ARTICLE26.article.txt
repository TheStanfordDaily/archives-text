# Women's Council Candidates Present Platforms to Voters
## 
### 
Susan Russell

Since Women's Council serves
a judicial rather than legislative
function, 1 prefer to state my con
cept of the office rather than to
present a platform as such.

It is impera
tive that a
council woman's
knowledge of
University reg
ulations and
standards
should include
a thorough un
derstanding of
the philosophy
behind them.
The new so
cial regulations

system has been created within a
framework of liberal ideas, i.e.,
that the system should not be es
sentially penal, but oriented to
ward creating new awareness and
appreciation of the “reason for
the rule.”
The councilwoman necessarily
plays an important role in the in
terpretation of this system.
Coupled with complete knowledge
of standards must be a desire to
interpret them consistently and
justly. It is with both of these fac
tors strongly in mind that I choose
to run for this office.

Stanford now has over 3,000
graduate students, ye t their
voices are seldom heard on cam
pus afairs. This is partly due to

choice: for a nun
graduates sim
ply don’t have
the undergrad
uate’s interest
in, say, student
government.
But much
un fortunately
is due to
chance. If elect
ed, I will con
tinue to work
towards both
bringing grad

uates into A.S.S.U. afairs and rep
resenting their views faithfully
on Legislature. So he semi-activist
and vote.

Instead of the high minded,

easily forgotten
campaign state
ment or th e
“pie • in - the •
sky’’ promise of
today, let me
just say that I
would appreci
ate the oppor
tunity to CON
TINUE to rep
resent the best
interests of the
graduate st u

dents from the combined schools
of Mineral Sciences, Sciences and
Humanities.

With the initiation of a new
system of social regulations for
Stanford women, (he demands
upon the individual for personal
responsibility have assumed great

er emphasis.
Therefore the
re s p onsibility
of Wo m e n’s
Council and the
other educative
bodies to inter
pret and en
force social reg
ulations is of
optimum im
portance if the
freedom of the

individual de
cision i-s to be effectively main
tained.
I visualize two areas of concen
tration for the council: 11 elimina
tion of inconsistency and contra
diction in policies and procedures;
2) re-evaluation of policy in order
to effect a more legitimate bal
ance between the seriousness of
a violation and its consequent
penalty.

In my opinion Women’s Coun
cil is a body concerned primarily
with education, not punishment.
It should not be thought of as an
ominous body, but one to which

girls will feel
free to come.
It is each
girl’s responsi
bility to follow
the social regu
-1 at i on s. If
something goes
wrong. Wo m
e n ’ s Council
should help the
girl to under
stand the im
portance of the

rule broken or forgotten.
As for qualifications I helped
to set up the Lagunita Auxiliary
Committee last year and was on
I Lagunita Committee of seven.
From this experience I know
| that respect for each girl’s case
| is vital.

I am basical
ly skeptical of
good people do
ing good deeds.
I believe that
the primary
function of stu-
Ide nt govern
ment is to act
as an organiz
ing agent for
the students
and little more.
