# WILBUR LASSU REPS...

If someone were to ask why I
am running for this office I would
have to say one of the reasons is
the prestige, and I think most
candidates would have to say the

same thing.
I do feel,
however, that I
have some con
crete proposals
which could
help the men at
Wilbur. Among
these are a cir-'
dilating library
at Wilbur
which would
‘’old such ma
dials as Civ.

Syllabus Sources. A representa
tive board consisting of a mem
ber from each house would insure
more direct representation.
If elected, I would present op
portunities for participation in
student government. Beyond that,
it’s up to the student.

I am running for LASSU repre
sentative of Wilbur Hal! because
I believe I have the personal qual
ifications necessary for tMe of
fice desire and ability.

The main
duty of this job
is to represent
adequately and
accurately the
Wilbur majori
ty. To help ac
complish this, I
would establish
a representa
tive council in
Wilbur with a
circulating 1i

h r a r y with
Western Civ syllabus sources
test files, etc. See me in Madera
116 if you have any questions.

These two points from my plat
form, plus the interest, initiative
and imagination of each of you
should make the class of ’65 an
important part of student gov

ernment at
Stanford.
1. I would
publish a legis
lature newslet
ter to better in
form you as to
what actually
happens at (he
Thursday night
LASSU meet
ings.
2. I would
not only attend

meetings of the Freshman Execu
tive Committee, but those of each
house as well, in an endeavor to
represent the interests of all Wil
bur men.

As a candidate for LASSU rep
resentative, I believe in wider
LASSU jurisdiction; I am solidly
behind the Sophomore LASSU
Representation amendment; I ad

vocate estab
lishment of
pre spri n g
quarter rush
and elimination
of the ’no con
tact’ rule.
The LASSU
re presentative
must objective
ly consider the
ideas and atti
tudes of his
c on st ituents

and effectively present them to
the Legislature, I am qualified to
serve in this capacity and will
need your support

As a candidate for LASSU rep

If someone were to ask why I
am running for this office I would
have to say one of the reasons is
the prestige, and I think most
candidates would have to say the

same thing.
I do feel,
however, that I
have some con
crete proposals
which could
help the men at
Wilbur. Among
these are a cir-'
dilating library
at Wilbur
which would
‘’old such ma
dials as Civ.

Syllabus Sources. A representa
tive board consisting of a mem
ber from each house would insure
more direct representation.
If elected, I would present op
portunities for participation in
student government. Beyond that,
it’s up to the student.
