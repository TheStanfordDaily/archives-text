## 6 VIE FOR 2 POSTS IN MEN'S COUNCIL

Randy Devening
Improvement in Student Gov
j eminent should begin with that
area already highly respected, the
| judicial -system. The Dean has re
viewed all decisions of the Men’s

Council in the
past. This i s
not a good poli
|c y : Stanford
students are
mature enough
to handle their
own disciplin
ary problems,
and since the
Fun damental
I Standard and
Honor Code are
student writ

(en, they should be allowed to en
force them without administra
tional review.
Increased independence for
Men’s Council would increase the
prestige of this area of Student
Government, thereby encouraging
other areas to improve their own
prestige, raising the constructive
achievement level for all of Stu
dent Government.

I feel the purpose of a Judiciary ]
Council at Stanford is to provide
the students with a means of up-!
holding the constitution, by-laws,
and Honor Code of the university |

I do not think
the action by
men’s council
should be di
rected towards
strict punish
ment in every
case. Men’s
Council should
be thought of
as a corrective
rather than a
retributive
agency that en

ables the students to be Judged by
their peers.
If elected this fall I would like
to see Men’s Council working in
conjunction with the Judiciary
bodies of the living groups in or- I
der that each individual case may
he given careful scouting and con
sideration, avoiding “r übber
stamp” policies.

The students of this university \
have a responsibility for self-gov-1
ernment. Membership on Men’s,
Council should be regarded as ac
tive acceptance of this responsi

bility. In per
haps no other
facet of student
government at
Stanford is
there afforded
greater oppor
tunity for un
dergraduate
re presentation
and control.
The placing of
Judicial respon
sibility in the

hands of his peers is the student’s
most effective means of insuring
Judicial impartiality. It is to this
impartiality, and to this aware
ness of student responsibility, that
I pledge my support if elected to
Men’s Council.

Jon Hirschoff
A good deal of responsibility
for student self-control at Stan- i
for is held by the Judicial system •
Individual living group councils
should have jurisdiction whenever :

possible, for
each group of
students feels
responsible for
control of its
own affairs.
Ho we v e r,
there is a defi
nite need for
all-campus Ju
diciary coun
cils. Men’s and
Women’s Coun
cils are respon

sihie for trying Honor Code viola
tions. Traffic citations issued by
campus police, if felt unreason
able, may be appealed to Men’s
Council.
I believe I have the desire and
ability to help carry out these and
other responsibilities to the stu
dent body.

Men’s Council is a judiciary
body. With this idea in mind I am
a candidate for a seat on this
council, not as a red-hot seeking
another office to be used as an

other activity
to spice up a
job application,
but as a Stan
for student in
terested in see
ing the Funda
mental Stand
ard become
more effective.
Every deci
sion made by
Men’s Council

depends on an

accurate interpretation of prece
dence and a clear understanding
of the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code. Being a member of
the Fundamental Standard Com
mission, I have had much experi
ence in dealing wilii the problems
of the Fundamental Standard,
and I have a clear understanding
of it. 1 make no high-sounding
promises, just quiet, competent
justice.
