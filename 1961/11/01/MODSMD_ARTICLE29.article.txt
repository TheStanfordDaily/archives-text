swimming pool of the next-door
apartment house where firemen
Arylen Hettrick of Palo Alto and
John Barr of San Jose were paint

Hettrick dived into the water
fully clothed and held the boyâ€™s
heart above water, and Barr
pulled them both out of the
water. Young Runnels though
thoroughly wet. was not hurt.
The boy and a neighbor girl
had squeezed through the fence
into the apartment house yard
while his mother's back was
turned.

prompt and speedy rescue.
