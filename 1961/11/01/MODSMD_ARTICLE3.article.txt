## TV Topic Of Ex-BBC President 
### SUK BROWN 
The factors controlling the de
velopment of British and interna
tional television was the subject
of a speech given by Sir Gerald
Beadle, former president of the
British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC)
last night for the Tuesday Eve
ning Series.
Sir Gerald first described and
compared the two British TV sta
tions, the BBC and the Indepen
den Television Authority (ITA).
While both are government
owned today, he said, the BBC,
unlike the ITA, was originated by
private industry. The BBC is
financially supported by public
revenue, and it does its own pro
gram planning and production.
THE PROGRAMMING of the
ITA, however, is done by 12 pri
vate program contracting com
panies, The station is supported
by the profits these companies
derive by selling advertising time
on the air. He added that both
stations, in the end, have about
the same amount of money to
use in programming.
To minimize third party con
trol over TV in Britain, said Sir
Gerald lawful measures have
been taken to control industry’s
influences on the ITA. He empha
sized that the BBC is not influ
enced by government policy, be
cause all restraints which the
government places on the BBC
must be announced publicly.
The most unique and thus im
portant function of TV, said Sir
Gerald, is to be a “window on the
world,” to bring events to people
as they are happening. Europe,
through a lineage standard con
version system, has developed
Eurovision, a live TV network
now linking together 17 European
countries, including Russia.
THE GAP of the Atlantic,
which prevents live transmissions
between Europe and the North
ern Hemisphere, must and will
be spanned by means of satellites,
Sir Gerald stated.
He believes that the accusation
that TV is corrupting today’s
youth is exaggerated. But, in his
opinion, TV’s “real problem” is
to produce more “positively bene
ficial” programs.
The BBC’s emphasis on pro
grams of cultural value and the
growing popularity of this sta
tion in contrast to the less cul
turally-minded ITA is proof to
Sir Gerald that in an educated
democracy a well balanced pro
gram will do well.
