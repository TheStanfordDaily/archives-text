# Daring Climbers Face Dangers of 4-Foot Fall
## 
### EDWARD MACKAY 
The man clings to the granite
cliff searching for a good hand
hold. As his fingers tire, his grip
begin to loosen and he cries a
last warning “falling!” before
swinging out into space at the
end of his safety rope.
Fortunately the ground is only
four feet away, and he is quickly
lowered to it.
The above scene is common
place at the practice climbs held
by the Stanford Alpine Club each
Sunday when they are not on an
expedition. Here they practice on
20-foot cliffs what they must
later do on 200-foot ones. The
techniques are the same; mis
takes here are more tolerable.

THE CLUB was founded in the
fall of 1946 by Larry Taylor and
A1 Baxter. Members were recruit
ed from the skiing and hiking
clubs.
Many of the initial members
soon lost enthusiasm, but a hard
core of dedicated climbers re
mained. The main problem en
countered at the onset was the
training of the newcomers, as
there were only two experienced
climbers in the club.
A system modeled on the Sierra
Club’s methods was set up, and
it is still in use today. Trips were
made to Pinnacles National Mon
ument, and Yosemite Valley,
where Half Dome and Split Pin
nacle were climbed. On a later
trip Baxter and two others made
the first ascent of Watkins’ Pin
nacles, a heretofore unclimbed
peak.
THAT summer Baxter and an
other boy made the first ascent
of Stanford Pinnacle in the Tet
ons. For (he first several years
the pace continued, with thie ex
pert members leading difficult
climbs and going on summer ex
peditions to mountains all over
the west.
Then, after a series of accidents
which lowered morale greatly,
the younger members made an
“agonizing re - appraisal” and
faced the fact that they were not
experienced enough for the more
ambitious climbs of their expert
predecessors.
Accordingly, they set up a clas
sification system whereby one
had to pass tests of skill to be al
lowed to climb on regular expedi
tions, and only after much ex
perience could one become a lead
er of a party. Accidents became
rare, and the club flourished
again.
AT PRESENT the twenty mem
bers of the club are very active.
Members have climbed many of
the Yosemite Valley climbs, and
last spring a trip was taken to
Shiprock, New Mexico. A favorite
trip is to Castle Crags in Oregon.

Many climbers have taken sum
mer trips, and several have been
to Peru, making first ascents in
the Andes.
Each weekend when there is no
trip scheduled, a practice climb
is held in the bay area. Here on
short climbs, the older members
teach rappelling, use of pitons
and knots, and belaying to the
beginners while practicing them
selves. (In rappeling the rope is
tied to something solid, wound
between the legs, around the hip,
across the shoulder, and the per
son walks backward down the
cliff.)
One weekend in the fall the
club goes to Tuolumne Meadows
in Yosemite National Park and
practices on the many climbs
there. These trips are open to
anyone interested, but the
Thanksgiving trip to Yosemite
Valley is open only to qualified
members.
BESIDES being able to pass
(he tests of skill, a person must
participate in a dynamic belay
before he is qualified. This tests
his ability to stop a falling per
son, using a 100-pound rock tied
to the rope to simulate (he weight.
The rock is dropped over the
edge of a short cliff, and he must
stop it before it hits the bottom.
In actual climbing, safety is
stressed above all. The leader
climbs with a safety rope and the
followers tie in one by one and
climb to the leader while he be
lays (holds (he rope in case (hey
fall).
Whenever mountain climbing
is discussed, the question of why
people do it inevitably arises.
Their reasons are as varied as one
might expect.
Some simply do it for fun, and
it is fun. Others consider the
mountain as a challenge to be
faced. Suffice it to say that it is
an interesting and exciting sport,
giving a great sense of satisfac
tion to its followers.


ALPINE CLUB MEMBER practices on Goat Rock, about 20 miles south
of Stanford on Skyline Boulevard, to ready himself for weekend
climbing excursions.
