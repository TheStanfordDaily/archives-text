# Prof. Matt Kahn Speaks Tonight
## 
### 
Prof. Matt Kahn of the Stan
ford Art Department, through his
speech “Inside Art” will attempt
symbolically to “share his studio”
with interested students at 7:30
tonight in Room 320.
Using slides of his own work,
he will conduct a discussion much
more subjective than a classroom
lecture. Although there is no resi
dent artist in the art department,
it does have Kahn, a practicing
artist, on its staff.
“The value of a resident artist,”
says Kahn, “is in the intimate
contact possible with students.”
Through his discussion, ho will
attempt to establish this contact.
