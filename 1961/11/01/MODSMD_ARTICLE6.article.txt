# Grade Withdraws; Nine Males Alone As Balloting Begins
## 
### 
• Grade Daniels withdrew as a
candidate lor head yell leader
yesterday on the eve of elections,
thus leaving nine men in the
field.

Voting in the ASSU primaries
begins today at 8:30 a.m. at En
gineering Corner and the Post
Office. Polls close at 3 p.m.,
although votes may be cast to
night at the Main Library from
7 to 9.
STUDENTS are reminded to
have their student body cards
with them to be eligible to vote.
The primaries end at 3 p.m. to
morrow.
In her statement of declination,
Grade said her purpose for enter
ing the race had been fulfilled.
Interest and humor in the cam
paign were generated and many
men have entered the race, she
said.
She explained she had received
a letter from her cousin, Billl Kar
tozian, which said he was op
posed to a girl yell leader.
WROTE Kartozian; “I don’t
think any girl, no matter who,
could effectively control the male
rooting section.
“I would fear for the reputa
tion, sensitivities, and saneness
of any girl who attempted to be
a Kartozian-like figure.”
So, said Gracie, “I urge the
student body to vote for the male
candidate they think most quali
fied for the position.”
TOM NEEL has declared him
selfa write-in candidate for frosh
president. “I feel that the pri
mary purpose for having class
officers has been ignored in the
campaign,” he said.
The election has become a pop
ularity contest stimulated by
house rivalries, he said.
Neel said he wanted to see the
Class of ’6.3 function as a unit,
not as a disintegrated body of
separate living groups.

SOME of his ideas are a fresh
man directory, a class talent
show, and several all-class social
functions.

“I appeal to all freshmen who
want a unified class to elect mo,”
he said.
