# RUSSELL:
## U.S. Should Resume Tests In Atmosphere 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Sen.
Richard B. Russell said yesterday
the United States should resume
atmospheric tests until it perfects
the neutron bomb a weapon
which would kill humans but
leave property intact.
The Georgia Democrat gave no
indication that he believed a neu
tron bomb test was in sight. But
Rep. Albert Thomas, D-Tex., hint
ed that the United States might
decide shortly to resume some
form of above-ground nuclear
testing.
THOMAS, a member of the
House-Senate Atomic Energy
Committee, predicted the Ken
nedy administration would an
nounce “within a few days”
whether it will resume nuclear
explosions in the atmosphere.
Russsell is chairman of the Sen
ate services committee.
These developments came as
the Soviet Union continued its
weapons testing, although Premi
er Nikita Khrushchev had said
the series would end with the
explosion of the 50-mogaton bomb
detonated Monday.
The Atomic Energy Commis
sion announced that the Russians
conducted two more atmospheric
tests yesterday. The first was
"several megatons.” The second
was in the megaton range, the
AEC said.
THOMAS' prediction (hat a
U.S. announcement on atmospher
ic testing would be forthcoming
soon was made after he received
an up-to-the-minute briefing from
Atomic Energy Commission and
Central Intelligence Agency offi
cials.
AEC chairman Glenn T. Sea
borg said last weekend that the
decision rested with President
Kennedy.
