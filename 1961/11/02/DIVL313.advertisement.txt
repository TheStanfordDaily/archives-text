Where can you find a pair of slacks
that fit real tight—like a second skin?
Easy! See yourself in sliver-slim
Pipers, the best thing that ever hap
pened to a guy! They ride down low
on your hips, cuffs are out and belts
are nowhere—hidden side tabs do
the holdup job. In a host of wonder
ful, washable fabrics—s4.9s to $8.95
at campus stores that are "with it”.
