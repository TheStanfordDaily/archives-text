# POLLS CROWDED
## Primary Voting High; To Continue Today 
### 
Today is the final day for vot
ing in the ASSU primary election.
The polls, at Engineering Corner
and in front of the Post Office,
will open at 8:30 a.rn. and will
close at 3 p.m. They will not be
open tomorrow night.

More than 1720 people voted
yesterday, with 80 grad students
and 530 freshmen participating.
The Elections Commission is par
ticularly pleased with the turnout
since only 2500 people voted at all
in last fall’s elections.

THE FINAL elections will be
held next Tuesday and Wednes
day at Engineering Corner and
the Post Office. The candidates
who are successful today will vie
for final election then. Voters
must show their student body
cards at the polls when voting
both in the primaries and in the
final election.

Two new names have been en
tered in the Head Yell Leader con
test. Roger Salquist and Glenn
Odell, both write-in candidates,
announced their candidacy early
this week.

Salquist, when contacted by
The Daily, said, “I feel the real
purpose of the rooting section is
to support the team and develop
enthusiasm in the student body.
I entered the race on a write-in
because I felt there was no real
choice among all the candidates
running, no one who would really
have the strong support of the
whole student body. I believe I
can maintain that support not by
a complete elimination of humor
but by the right direction of it.”
Glenn Odell had this to say, “I
entered this campaign in response
to a demand by the student body
for a type of yell leading that w>as
not in evidence at last weekend’s
rally and game. I am not running
on a Salvation Army Ticket, but I
do believe that a yell leader does
not have to be offensive in order
to support the team.”
‘‘Humor is necessary in order

to keep the attention of the root
ing section so that the primary
function of supporting the team
can best be fulfilled. What we
saw Saturday was neither effec
tive nor humorous nor in good
taste. Humor should consist of
wit, not of undisguised crude
ness. My ideal is simply to give
our team the best support pos
sible while supplying the audi
ence at large with chuckles, chor
tles and hearty guffaws.”

ALSO ON the ballot for voter
consideration is the following pro
posed amendment to the ASSU
constitution:

WHEREAS, there are no Sopho
mores on the ASSU Legislature,
WHEREAS, Sophomores make
up 'i of tf ’ undergraduate stu
dent body,

WHEREAS, we feel that 1400
duly registered members of the
ASSU should not be denied the
right to run for office or denied
the right to vote for those that do
run for office,

WHEREAS, Legislature has re
fused to allow the student body
to vote on Sophomore representa
tion,

We, the undersigned, demand
that the President of the ASSU
place the following constitutional
amendment on the ballot as pro
vided for in the ASSU Constitu
tion:
ARTICLE 111, Section I

The regular members of the
Legislature shall be the President
of the Association, the Vice Pres
ident, undergraduate representa
tives elected by living area con
stituencies with the exception of
the Sophomore representatives,
and graduate representatives

stituencies. The constituencies
and the number of representa
tives shall be a resident of the
living area, or a member of the
class, or a member of the aca
demic division from which he is
elected, at the time ho is repre
senting them.
