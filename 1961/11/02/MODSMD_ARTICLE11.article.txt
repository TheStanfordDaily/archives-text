(UPD Thousands of women
“strikers for peace” and college
students called on Soviet Russia
and the United States yesterday
to end nuclear testing and the
East-West arms race.
Housewives leading children
and wheeling baby carriages
demonstrated before the White
House and the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, the United Nations
headquarters and Russian U.N.
mission in New York City and
centers of government through

THEY URGED that Mrs. John
F. Kennedy and Mrs. Nikita
Khrushchev help bring a halt to
the nuclear tests in the interest
of survival of the human race.
A delegation of marchers met
with three Soviet officials at the
Russian Embassy for more than
an hour. They said the Russians
“seemed concerned about world
peace” but gave no assurances
that the U.S.S.R. would stop test
ing even after exploding its 50-
megaton-plus nuclear bomb.
MOST OF the demonstrators
were part of a “women’s day for
peace” movement started by Mrs.
Dagmar Wilson, a Washington,

Placards carried by the wom
en, children and class-skipping
students spelled out their appeal:
“We must disarm together
before we perish together,” read
a sign carried by one of more
than 100 housewives and coeds
who staged an hour-long vigil out
side the county building at Ann
Arbor, Mich.
—“CLEAN milk and dirty
bombs don’t mix,” said a sign
wielded by one of 150 pickets near
the Park Avenue mission of the
Soviet U.N. delegation in New
York.
“Stop nuclear testing,” urged
a placard carried by a member of
a 40-woman group who paraded
around the City Hall and U.S.
Courthouse in Chicago.
SIX HUNDRED women march
ed from the Washington Monu
ment to the White House and the

“blackmailing bomb” had given
the United States the opportunity
to recapture moral leadership of
the world.
