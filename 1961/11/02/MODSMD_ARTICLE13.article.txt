Perhaps the most rewarding
experience of attending a con
cert by student musicians is that
of seeing the performers’ joy and
intense involvement in their
work. This was particularly evi
dent at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Sunday afternoon, when a concert
of chamber music was presented.

The first selection was Schu
mann’s “Three Romances” for
oboe and piano, performed by
Charles Price, oboe, and Walter
Moore, piano. The standard of
musicianship achieved by these
two students is very rarely heard
below a pi’ofessional level.
Price’s tone on his difficult in
strument was always under per
fect control, perhaps partly due
to his taking time between the
first and second movements to
clean his oboe, a rather unusual
practice. Yet his technical pre
cision did not in any way detract
from the fire and delicacy of his
interpretation of these poetic
mood pieces.
HE WOULD EVEN have man
aged to make this exacting work
seem easy, one of the marks of a
real professional, had it not been
for the arduousness of the breath
ing technique, which almost
caused his audience to hold its
breath in sympathy with him. A
near perfect balance was main
tained between the oboe and the
piano, producing a lovely inter
play between the two instru
ments.

Second on the program was
Heinrich Schiitz's “God So Loved
the World,” sung, in German, by
the Stanford Chorale, Prof. Har
old Schmidt conducting.
This group also performed
three chromatic madrigals, “Oh
care, thou wilt dispatch me;
Hence care, thou art too cruel” by
Thomas Weelkes, Claudio Monte
verdi’s “M’e pin dolce il penar,”
and “Dolcissima mia vita” by Car
lo Gesualdo.
THE FIRST WORK was well ex
ecuted after an unfortunate be
ginning, with an uneven cut-off.
The madrigals, which were all
37th century love songs, were
sometimes lacking in the intona
tion and precision of the inner
harmonies and the enunciation of
the words. However, the excellent
treatment of the dynamics, especi
ally the forte-pianos, and the clar
ity of the sopranos on some rath
er difficult high notes more than
offset this.
The audience experienced a
rather sudden syltistic shock at
the beginning of the next selec
tion, Paul Hindemith’s “Sonata
for flute and piano,” which was
composed in 1935.
Flutist Margaret Radin and pi
anist Henry Gibbons were the per
formers. There is really no stand
ard on which to judge the diffi
culties involved in the execution
of modern classical music, par
ticularly that of this century, as
compared to those of the music of
the Baroque and romantic peri
ods.
HOWEVER. most musicians
will agree that the modern is
more difficult technically, at
least. Both performers showed a
good mastery of these difficulties
in their solo parts particularly,
where the unpredictable rhythms
and abrupt changes of theme
were very well handled.
However, the balance between
the two instruments was uneven,
and several times the flute could
not be heard at all for the loud
ness of the piano, especially in the
first movement. The intensity of
the second movement, “Sehr lang
sam,” was impressive, as was the
interpretation of the dynamics
throughout the performance.
Once again the breathing patterns
were noticeably troublesome to
the performer, and as a result,
Miss Radin’s generally pure tone
occasionally broke, and her con
cluding notes of each movement
were uncertain rhythmically.
HOWEVER, THE obvious total
involvement of the student musi
cians in the music they were play
ing served to communicate the

contemporary spirit of Hinde
mith’s modern composition.
After a short intermission Prof.
Sandor Salgo led the Stanford
Chamber Orchestra in a perform
ance of Haydn’s Symphony No.
93, in D major. The precision and
exact attention to dynamics and
style of this group made this “old
classic’’ sound truly young and
never more alive. The tympani,
oboe, bassoon and trumpet solo
ists deserve particular praise.
The clarity of the strings, es
pecially the first violins and cel
los, was also remarkable. It
served to emphasize unduly the
very rare moments when the vi
olins were not quite certain of
those top notes or not quite to
gether, or when the tone of the
cellos and primarily of the basses
left something to be desired.
THE STRING QUARTET, com
posed of the concertmaster and
the first second violinist, violist
and cellist, was delightful, even
if the bassoon was not always
exactly together with the strings
after its entrance, and the oboe
was a little inclined to rush.
The woodwind and brass tuning
could also have been more care
fully done. The performance
nevertheless had a charming and
almost intoxicating effect on its
appreciative listeners.
Of the many student music con
certs at Stanford, most of them
of definitely superior quality,
Sunday’s concert was one of the
best. The enthusiasm and genuine
love of music of the performers
was very successfully transmitted
to a near-capacity audience.

Last Sunday’s chamber music
concert at Dinkelspiel Auditori
um prompted me to gather to
gether a few impressions that 1
had gained regarding the teach
ing and performance of serious
music in America.
In particular, I should like to
comment upon the performance
of Haydn’s 93rd Symphony under
the direction of Mr. Sandor Salgo.
The work, as a whole, was play
ed with verve, enthusiasm and a
high degree of technical accom
plishment by both the members of
the orchestra and the conductor.
Yet it was precisely in the manner
of the performance that I felt
both the composer and the stu
dent players had been slighted.

THE LATE Klemens Krauss,
when leading the Vienna Philhar
monic Orchestra in recording ses
sions, jokingly used to ask the en
gineers whether they wanted the
music played “slow cans.”
I do not think that analogy
would bo too much out of place
here. To my mind Mr. Salgo’s
tempi were far too rushed to do
true justice to the music.
But even more serious is the im
plication for the music student in
conservatories and universities
throughout the United States. For
if they are taught that good mu
sicianship means rushing through
a composition with the minimum
number of mistakes, then I fear
American music students are be
ing only half-educated.

ON THE ONE hand what good
is it if the performers play well
mechanically as individuals and
yet do not understand the com
position as a whole?
I have in mind here the matter
of ensemble playing, a point
where American orchestras are
noticeably inferior to their Euro
pean counterparts.

When students play together in
an orchestra, they are there to
gain experience in playing as a
single musical entity, not to pit
their technical ability in a race
against time. Here, I feel, it is im
portant, particularly in an aca
demic atmosphere, that the direc
tor exercise his teaching and guid
ing faculties rather than attempt
a “virtuoso-like” performance.
NOW THIS is not so much Mr.
Salgo’s fault, I believe, as rather
a symptom of what is happening
to serious music in the United
States. For it seems to be a gen
eral tendency that highly gifted
European conductors, when
placed in the American musical
scene, succumb to what for a bet
ter term I shall call “studio slick
ness.”

I am worried about this pheno
menon because it implies that the
very basis of serious music, its
European cultural background, is
being assimilated indeed over
whelmed—by a civilization very
alien to it.

This brings me to the other
point of my argument, namely
that of values. Composers do not
create music in a vacuum; they
are deeply influenced by the po
litical, social and intellectual cli
mate around them.

LISTENING TO last Sunday’s
performance of Haydn’s sympho
ny I wondered if his message
was “coming through” to the ar
tists and the audience. To a cer
tain extent, of course, an audience
can respond pleasurably to music
whether it be live or electronic.

But unless the performers
themselves, and through them the
audience, are atune to the full
range contained in every bar of
the music, they will never experi
ence that kind of “appreciation”
which rises above mere technical
perfection to the love of the music
and its heritage together.
It is not my intention at all to
be a Beckmesser, and I hope that

Mr. Salgo and his students fully
understand this. But I am con
cerned with what I feel to be the
distortion of both the technical
and the cultural values of serious
music within the framework of
the American musical scene.
