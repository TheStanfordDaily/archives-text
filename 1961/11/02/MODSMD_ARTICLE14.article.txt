Editor, The Daily:
Once again we are embroiled
in a squabble about the Funda
mental Standard. It seems evident
that unless it is to be applied uni
formly throughout the university
community, it is about as mean
ingful as freedom under “big
brother.”

Yet LASSU, while requesting
freshmen to act in compliance
with it, continues to ignore the
piratical Stanford Bookstore’s at
titude of defiance and contempt
towards the Standard.

Specifically, if the University
and/or ASSU is convinced that we
are not to be trusted, as evidenced
by the Bookstore’s paranoiac re
quirement, “leave all articles out
side,” by what process of double
think do they imagine us trust
worthy in respecting the property
which others are forced to leave
outside?

And yet, it remains intact. We
have heard of no thievery in
front of the Bookstore, That is
more than we can say once we
have walked through the door.
Indeed, the timeworn practice
of a monopoly charging all the
market will bear is dignified in
comparison with the Bookstore’s
penny-robbing by totally disre
garding the laws of rounding to
compute the “ten per cent” dis
count and by computing the sales
tax from a scale which is in direct
conflict with the statutes of the
State of California. The net effect
of these tactics is to filch from
the students on almost every sale.

Unless the Standard needs to be
scrapped, and we hope not, it is
imperative that it apply in the
Bookstore as well as in Inner
Quad or anyplace else.
Until the barriers come down
and the grotesque carts are ban
ished, the place will continue to
have an odious atmosphere about
it which makes us ashamed to
admit that this, somehow, has
gotten to be part of the new Stan
ford.
