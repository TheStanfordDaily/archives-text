WESTERN CULTURE
Editor, The Daily:
I should like to offer Miss Shar
on Cobb words of comfort in her
despair and indignation. Having
been in the teaching game for a
few years now I’ve finally grown
able to accept the absolute resist
ance to Western culture on the
part of most students.
Curiously enough this accept
ance was largely inspired by a
fine little scholarly book called
“Election By Lot at Athens” by
J. W. Hcadlam.
With utter serenity Professor
Headlam describes the insane
fashion in which the ancient
Athenians secured absolute sov
ereignty for the mass in utter
disregard of the principles of su
periority and excellence. In
Athens it was political sovereign
ty whereas I am speaking of cul
tural sovereignty; but the idea is
the same, and of course, the
Athenians were right to do as
they did—however much it de
stroyed them because Athens
did belong to the people.
We live in a country in which
there exists a vast, rich and en
ergetic proletariate (in Toynbee’s
sense, i.e., a people not sharing
in the culture). This is their coun
try and most universities are
largely populated by them.
He who cares to learn anything
other than the content of the
many trade courses on campus
must simply make the effort to
steer cleap of such people. Avoid
the Flicks, endure through re
quired courses, and look to the
more recherche aspects of the
humanities and natural sciences
for a field of concentration.

BICYCLE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
Two incidents, perhaps typical
of others on the campus, may il
lustrate why cycling at Stanford
is preserved for the quick-witted:
At about 7 p.m. last Thursday
evening a cyclist, displaying a
light that had been approved by a
police officer, was nearly elimi
nated at the intersection of Cam
pus Drive and Escondido when an
oncoming car turned directly into
the path of the cyclist, missed
him by a few inches, and zipped
off along Campus Drive.
And on a clear afternoon a cy
clist pedaling north on Escondido
past the south Branner driveway
suddenly found himself superim
posed on a VW that had failed to
stop at the driveway exit before
pulling into his side and whose
chagrined driver explained, “Sor
ry ■ — just didn’t see you out
there!”

The first cyclist killed on cam
pus may be one who was myopic
about traffic signs, but he prob
ably will have been hit by a car
making an illegal turn.

With utter serenity Professor
Headlam describes the insane
fashion in which the ancient
Athenians secured absolute sov
ereignty for the mass in utter
disregard of the principles of su
periority and excellence. In
Athens it was political sovereign
ty whereas I am speaking of cul
tural sovereignty; but the idea is
the same, and of course, the
Athenians were right to do as
they did—however much it de
stroyed them because Athens
did belong to the people.
We live in a country in which
there exists a vast, rich and en
ergetic proletariate (in Toynbee’s
sense, i.e., a people not sharing
in the culture). This is their coun
try and most universities are
largely populated by them.
He who cares to learn anything
other than the content of the
many trade courses on campus
must simply make the effort to
steer cleap of such people. Avoid
the Flicks, endure through re
quired courses, and look to the
more recherche aspects of the
humanities and natural sciences
for a field of concentration.

BICYCLE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
Two incidents, perhaps typical
of others on the campus, may il
lustrate why cycling at Stanford
is preserved for the quick-witted:
At about 7 p.m. last Thursday
evening a cyclist, displaying a
light that had been approved by a
police officer, was nearly elimi
nated at the intersection of Cam
pus Drive and Escondido when an
oncoming car turned directly into
the path of the cyclist, missed
him by a few inches, and zipped
off along Campus Drive.
And on a clear afternoon a cy
clist pedaling north on Escondido
past the south Branner driveway
suddenly found himself superim
posed on a VW that had failed to
stop at the driveway exit before
pulling into his side and whose
chagrined driver explained, “Sor
ry ■ — just didn’t see you out
there!”

The first cyclist killed on cam
pus may be one who was myopic
about traffic signs, but he prob
ably will have been hit by a car
making an illegal turn.

I should like to offer Miss Shar
on Cobb words of comfort in her
despair and indignation. Having
been in the teaching game for a
few years now I’ve finally grown
able to accept the absolute resist
ance to Western culture on the
part of most students.
Curiously enough this accept
ance was largely inspired by a
fine little scholarly book called
