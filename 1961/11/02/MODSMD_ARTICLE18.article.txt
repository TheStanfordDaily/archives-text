BOMB PROTEST
Editor, Tile Daily:
Certain students I’ve heard
commenting on the libe dawn pro
test are simply letting it trigger
their own favorite prejudices.
Sure, I do it too, more often than
some of you reading this no
doubt; but the fact remains it’s
always the most insensitive reac
tion, and this particular protest,
being altogether sincere, asked
for a sensitive reaction.

I’m complaining about the com
ment “must be some kind of nuts”
and its variants. In doing so, I’m
not going to defend the group on
the lawn, but to suggest that the
only informed, and therefore val
id, comments were those to be
hoard on the fringe of and right
within, the group.
Let’s not get involved with
those people who rushed by say
ing “some kind of nut” or we’ll be
led into false suppositions and the
issue of the bomb will be entirely
lost in talk of “lunatic fringe” and
nonconformity versus conformity.
It is probably obvious that 1
don’t believe that was a band of
pseudo-beatniks, posing outside
the libe; it is also irrelevant to the
main issue, which is still the
bomb, and which, hopefully, will
still be the bomb when the com
ment on the libe protest has run
its course.

BIKE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps the problem of cyclist
versus pedestrian might be re
solved if the University were to
invest some time and paint in out
lining paths for cyclists. Paths
could be defined both in Quad and
in areas outside of Quad.
There is also the possibility that
cyclists could be taught to stay on
the right side of streets running
through the Farm. This possibili
ty could be realized, one suspects,
if paths could be outlined on these
streets.
As one who learned how to
cycle in the Netherlands, I sus
pect that there also needs to be
instituted a remedial reading pro
gram for those cyclists who can
not read STOP signs. Someone
might also take the trouble to
teach them how to give hand sig
nals.

BOMB PROTEST
Editor, Tile Daily:
Certain students I’ve heard
commenting on the libe dawn pro
test are simply letting it trigger
their own favorite prejudices.
Sure, I do it too, more often than
some of you reading this no
doubt; but the fact remains it’s
always the most insensitive reac
tion, and this particular protest,
being altogether sincere, asked
for a sensitive reaction.

I’m complaining about the com
ment “must be some kind of nuts”
and its variants. In doing so, I’m
not going to defend the group on
the lawn, but to suggest that the
only informed, and therefore val
id, comments were those to be
hoard on the fringe of and right
within, the group.
Let’s not get involved with
those people who rushed by say
ing “some kind of nut” or we’ll be
led into false suppositions and the
issue of the bomb will be entirely
lost in talk of “lunatic fringe” and
nonconformity versus conformity.
It is probably obvious that 1
don’t believe that was a band of
pseudo-beatniks, posing outside
the libe; it is also irrelevant to the
main issue, which is still the
bomb, and which, hopefully, will
still be the bomb when the com
ment on the libe protest has run
its course.

BIKE PROBLEM
Editor, The Daily:
Perhaps the problem of cyclist
versus pedestrian might be re
solved if the University were to
invest some time and paint in out
lining paths for cyclists. Paths
could be defined both in Quad and
in areas outside of Quad.
There is also the possibility that
cyclists could be taught to stay on
the right side of streets running
through the Farm. This possibili
ty could be realized, one suspects,
if paths could be outlined on these
streets.
As one who learned how to
cycle in the Netherlands, I sus
pect that there also needs to be
instituted a remedial reading pro
gram for those cyclists who can
not read STOP signs. Someone
might also take the trouble to
teach them how to give hand sig
nals.
