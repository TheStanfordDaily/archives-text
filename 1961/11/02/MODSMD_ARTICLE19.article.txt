# Ducks Set To Invade
## 
### 
Stanfordâ€™s Indians, still scratch
ing their heads in amazement
over their loss to UCLA last week
end, will run up against the fast
improving but crippled Oregon
Ducks in the Stadium Saturday.
The Indians, who suffered their
second straight shutout, 20-0, at
the hands of the Bruins, despite a
favorable statistical edge, will be
facing the same thing that made
the difference last weekend tre
mendous backfield speed.
COACH JACK Curtice is still
groggy from a blow received ear
lier this week when he learned
that star quarterback Steve Thur
low will miss at least the next two
games.
Blood tests run on the talented
sophomore proved inconclusive
and it is still unknown as to
whether or not he has mononucle
osis. Curtice said that Thurlow
definitely will not play Saturday
and will probably miss the im
portant USC game next week.
Curtice has again shuffled his
lineup in hopes of putting an end
to a two-game losing streak.
George Honore and Steve Pursell
will start at ends, Randy Vahan
and Chuck Buehler, tackles;
Frank Dubofsky and Tom Walsh,
guards; Chris Cottle, center; Rod
Sears, quarterback; Danny
Spence and Stan Lindskog, half
backs and Jay Ward, full.
THIS WILL be the first start
for Buehler, a 231-pound junior
who has seen limited action
through the first of the season.
He replaces A1 Hildebrand who
is still slowed by a crushed foot.


STILL THE BIG question mark of Stanford football is sophomore
quarterback Steve Thurlow. Out of action with a disease which has
the symptoms of mononucleosis but cannot be diagnosed conclu
sively, the husky guy will miss at least the next two games.
