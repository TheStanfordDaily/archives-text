### THOMAS PARKER 
Work, sacrifice, desire, natural ability, good coaching, and a
little hick, is what Chris von Saltza, three-time Olympic gold medal
winner in swimming, says it takes to make a great swimmer. .Miss
von Saltza, hero of the 1960 Olympics in Rome and now a Stanford
freshman residing in Branner, is probably one of the most qualified

persons in United States amateur
sports make this statement.
Chris has been swimming com
petitively since she was eleven
years old, and has won the most
coveted awards an amateur can
win. Her coach, George Haines,
has been with her since her hum
ble start in the Santa Clara Swim
ming Club and has followed her
around the country and around
the world as she amassed trophies
and medals of gold and silver.
VV li E N ASKED what she
thought was her most exciting
moment in sports she said, “When
I won the 400-meter freestyle in
the 1960 Olympics.” If is worth
mentioning that she also was a
member of the winning 400-meter
Restyle relay team and the 400-
meter medley relay. She placed
second in the 100-meter freestyle
in that same year.
Chris’ grueling training pro
gram would discourage the
staunchest of Stanford athletes.
She swam five miles daily, dis
tance swimming and sprints,
when conditioning for the Olym
pics.
Chris, an international relations
major from Saratoga, California,
thinks a great deal of Farm life.
“I am very pleased, I really love
it.”
HER PHYSICAL education
course, surprisingly enough is
horseback riding, but Chris
claims to have been an equestrian
from way back.
In answer to the question: what
do you think of sports bn the ama
teur level? she replied, “Ameri
can amateur sports are a lot more
amateur than those of any other
country.
“Sports people from all over the
world thought I was making a
big mistake leaving swimming
for school, and there has always
been a great deal of pressure on
me to continue,” continued Miss
von Saltza.
When asked whether she ever
planned to go back to competitive
swimming, Chris answered with
a definite “no.”
“I always knew I was going to

quit when I graduated from high
school. I had to make the choice
between swimming and college,
and I made the choice almost be
fore I started swimming.
“That’s why I worked so hard
for the i960 Olympics, because I
knew I wouldn’t bo swimming in
1964.”
