# Raiders May Leave Oakland
## 
### 
OAKLAND (UPI) The Oak
land Raiders will move their
American League franchise next
year unless they get a place to
play in Oakland, two owners said
yesterday.
Wayne Valley and Ed McGah,
who with Robert Osborne own
most of the stock, said that by the
end of this season they will have
about $1 million invested in the
organization- with no indication
that the fans of Oakland will sup
port the club.
THE TEAM HAS played all its
home games in San Francisco—
at Candlestick Park and Kezar
Stadium.
“We’re all through in San Fran
cisco when this season ends,” said
Valley.
“We’ve got to have a place to
play in Oakland in 1962—and we
are not going to invest the money
ourselves.
“It would cost about $250,000 to
build us a temporary place to
play. We’ll spend all kinds of
money getting players, but we
won’t invest in a stadium.”
The owners would give no indi
cation whore they would move
the franchise.
