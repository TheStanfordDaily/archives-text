# Hofstadter Shares Nobel Physics Prize
## Project M Work Wins For Farm Prof, German 
### 
Stanford’s eighth Nobel prize was awarded yesterday to Dr.
Robert Hofstadter, 46, for basic atomic research on the smallest
particles of matter.
"Really? Are you sure?" was Hofstadter’s reaction to the news.
He heard about the award in a 4 a.m. phone call from his wife,

Nancy, after reporters had
phoned to break the news.
Hofstadter was in Royal Oak,
Mich., enroute to a scientific con
ference at Argonne National Lab
oratories in Lemont, 111., near
Chicago.
HIS WIFE, Nancy, said Hof
stadter had ‘no inkling” he was
being considered for the Nobel
award.
Announcement of the prize
changed Hofstadter’s plans. “He’s
coming right home,” Mrs. Hof
stadter said.
The physics prize was awarded
jointly to Hofstadter and Dr. Ru
dolf Moessbauer, 32, of Munich
University, but now working at
the California Institute of Tech
nology in Pasadena.
In its citation, the 149-memher
Swedish Royal Academy of Sci
ence in Stockholm said that Hof
stadter was honored for “his pi
oneering studies of electron scat
tering in atomic nuclei."
THE PRIZE is worth 250,000
Swedish crowns $48,300. Hof
stadter and Moessbauer will split
the money.
Hofstadter’s citation and prize
were given for his research into
methods for controlling nuclear
reaction to make it work for
peaceful purposes.
Moessbauer shared the prize
: for his separate research project
I on gamma rays, one of the haz-
I ards in space for astronauts.
Wallace Sterling, Stanford pres
: ident. said. “Stanford takes great
pride in the honor which has come
to Professor Robert Hofstadter.
We have known for many years
of the signal contributions Profes
sor Hofstadter was making to
man’s knowledge of the atomic
nucleus.
“THAT THESE accomplish
ments should now be recognized
in the award of the Nobel Prize
for physics is a great tribute to
him and an inspiration to the en
tire faculty of Stanford Univer
sity.”
Hofstadter told a UPI reporter
“this really shook me up.”
“People have talked about this,
but I never had any serious
thought that I might receive it,”
he said.
Hofstadter said that when he
first heard the news, “I couldn’t
take it for a few minutes. I still
think I’m dreaming. It is the
thing a scientist dreams for and
hopes for and we never get. I was
shaking for minutes after I finish
ed talking to my wife.”
HE SAID HE was heading for
home immediately. “You can un
derstand. I want to got there
quickly. This is something a man
likes to share with his wife and
family.”
Seven other researchers, fac
ulty members or former faculty
members have won Nobel prizes,
they are:
1959--Dr. Arthur Kornberg.
medicine.
1958—Prof. Joshua Lederberg,
medicine. Dr. Edward L. Tatum,
medicine. Dr. George W. Beadle,
medicine.
1956 Dr. William B. Shockley,
physics.
1955—Prof. Willis Lamb, phys
ics.
1952—Prof. Felix Bloch, phys
ics.
Hofstadter has been a teacher
and researcher all of his adult
life.
Hofstadter lives with his wife
and their throe children, Douglas,
i 16. Laurie, 11, and Molly, 7, at
