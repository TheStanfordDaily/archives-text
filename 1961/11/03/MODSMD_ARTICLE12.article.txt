# Capital Punishment —Immoral, Useless
## 
### 
The Shite of California will kill a man litis morning in the name
of justice.
He is James Kendrick, who was convicted of shooting to death
a California Highway Patrolman who stopped him after Kendrick
had held up a supermarket. He will die in San Quentin’s gas cham
ber at 10 a.m., by a process we are told is “painless.”
The advocates of capital punishment explain that he must die to
serve as a “warning” to those who in the future may contemplate
murder, so that they w ill stop and think about it before they commit
the deed.
This is nonsense. A man who can bring himself to the point
where he deliberately will consider murder will not be deterred by
capital punishment laws. And the man who, for instance, is caught
up by panic while robbing a store w ill not stop to think about the
gas chamber before firing at a policeman w ho tries to stop him from
escaping.
Even more important as an argument against capital punish
ment, however, is the fact that it accomplishes nothing, and occa
sionally is the death of an innocent man. We find it impossible to
morally justify killing a human being because he has killed another.
It se erns to us the humane and logical thing to do is to seriously
attempt rehabilitation in all possible ways. II this fails, the person
can be kept isolated from society without undue trouble.
A serious rehabilitation effort would involve re-examining our
entire penal system, however, to see if it is in reality accomplishing
anything. This would seem a more useful way to spend the tax
payer's dollar than on bigger and better missiles.
it also would mean taking a second look at how seriously Ameri
ca values human life. In a time when a national government can
seriously consider using nuclear weapons and talk calmly of “super
bombs and “death rays, this second look w'ould seem to be in order.
