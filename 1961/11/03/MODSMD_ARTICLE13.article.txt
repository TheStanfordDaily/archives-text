## On Alliance Troubles 
### 
What wo know of the contro
versy in Moscow about “Stalin
ism” is rather like seeing the sec
ond act of a mystery play, having
missed the first act. Why, just
now, should Stalinism have be
come a burning issue? We can
only guess. Could it he because
the hardboiled line taken by Red
China, Albania, and Herr Ulbricht
in East Germany, is incompatible
with the paramount interest of
Khrushchev’s Russia, which is to
realize the Twenty-Year Plan of
internal development?
If that is the explanation, there
might some day be some very in
teresting events in East Germany,
such as the replacement of the
Stalinist Ulbricht by a Communist
of the type of Gomulka in Poland.
Needless to say, we must count
no chickens until they are
hatched.
The trouble inside the Western
Alliance is not nearly so impoi’-
tant as that between Red China
and the Soviet Union within the
Communist Alliance. For Rod
China is potentially a very dan
gerous rival, once it achieves in
dustrialization.
WITH ITS enormous popula
tion, its long and vague frontier
with the Soviet Union, it will in
not too many years be able to chal
lenge not only the leadership of
the Soviet Union in the Commu
nist world, but the defenses of
the Soviet Union on the continent
of Asia.
As compared with this, there is
no such deep issue in the Western
community about negotiation con
cerning Berlin. But there is a con
troversy and it is not negligible.
If it is neglected, it could fester
into something dangerous.
The crux of the Western con
troversy is this. We are commit
ted to the freedom of West Ber
lin, free access to West Berlin,
and a continuing military pres
ence of the Western powers in
West Berlin. But we are not com
mitted irrevocably to the status
quo in all of Germany as it has
bon formulated in foreign policy
of Dr. Adenauer. We are commit
ted not to recognize the East Ger
man government. This commit
ment will be good unless the
Bonn government decides that
the most promising path to re
unification is to open up rela
tions with a post-Ulbricht govern
ment in East Germany.
BUT IN THE meantime we are
prepared to explore and, if the
terms seem satisfactory, to nego
tiate a wider settlement within
which the freedom of West Ber
lin can be assured by something
more than a perpetual willing
ness to unleash thermonuclear
war.

For this we are being called
appeasers, and we are warned
publicly by the French Ambassa
dor in Washington that we must
not wreck the Western Alliance.
Such threats, which imply that
the Western Alliance is very frag
ile, are coming from Paris and
from Bonn.
Their real purpose is to obtain!
a veto of all negotiations. The j
threats are unpleasant but they |
will prove to be unacceptable and i
unworkable. For if the United j
States has the ultimate power in |
the defense of the West, so it has j
the ultimate responsibility in the
issue of peace or war.
UXPKRIENC'F has shown how
costly can be the policy of refus
ing to negotiate, the policy not
only of standing pat but of sitting
down. Last summer when the
President had made the crucial
decision to stand firm at the risk
of war on our basic commitments
in West Berlin and to negotiate
on wider issues. Gen. de Gaulle
imposed a veto on negotiations.
Not long after that there took
place the action of Aug. 13 to
raise the wall in Berlin. In all
likelihood, had the West been al
lowed to explore the problem of
negotiating, the action of Aug. 13
would not have taken place, at
least during the explorations.
In the Rusk-Gromyko explora
tion, which took place after the
action of Aug. 13, there was
achieved the removal of the Dec.
13 deadline for signing a separate
peace treaty. It is impossible for
us to break off these explorations.
We cannot conduct the Western
Alliance on the troika principle.
We cannot repeat the mistake of
last summer. For that mistake
led to the Berlin wall.
THE SAME mistake now would
lead to the separate treaty, and
the nastiness of having to deal
with Herr Ulbricht.
It is blatantly untrue to say
that our willingness to negotiate
stems from weakness and irreso
lution. It stems from an increas
ingly clear realization that the
only conceivable way of protect
ing West Berlin and of achieving
an orderly development in all of
Germany, and security in Central
Europe, is to negotiate with the
Soviet Union.
The objectives of the West can
not bo achieved by war, which
would destroy all of Europe. They
cannot be achieved by threats or
by bluff or by deceiving ourselves
into thinking that if we bluff
grandly enough, Khrushchev will
not know that we are bluffing and
will then throw up his hands,

mitted irrevocably to the status
quo in all of Germany as it has
bon formulated in foreign policy
of Dr. Adenauer. We are commit
ted not to recognize the East Ger
man government. This commit
ment will be good unless the
Bonn government decides that
the most promising path to re
unification is to open up rela
tions with a post-Ulbricht govern
ment in East Germany.
BUT IN THE meantime we are
prepared to explore and, if the
terms seem satisfactory, to nego
tiate a wider settlement within
which the freedom of West Ber
lin can be assured by something
more than a perpetual willing
ness to unleash thermonuclear
war.

For this we are being called
appeasers, and we are warned
publicly by the French Ambassa
dor in Washington that we must
not wreck the Western Alliance.
Such threats, which imply that
the Western Alliance is very frag
ile, are coming from Paris and
from Bonn.
Their real purpose is to obtain!
a veto of all negotiations. The j
threats are unpleasant but they |
will prove to be unacceptable and i
unworkable. For if the United j
States has the ultimate power in |
the defense of the West, so it has j
the ultimate responsibility in the
issue of peace or war.
UXPKRIENC'F has shown how
costly can be the policy of refus
ing to negotiate, the policy not
only of standing pat but of sitting
down. Last summer when the
President had made the crucial
decision to stand firm at the risk
of war on our basic commitments
in West Berlin and to negotiate
on wider issues. Gen. de Gaulle
imposed a veto on negotiations.
Not long after that there took
place the action of Aug. 13 to
raise the wall in Berlin. In all
likelihood, had the West been al
lowed to explore the problem of
negotiating, the action of Aug. 13
would not have taken place, at
least during the explorations.
In the Rusk-Gromyko explora
tion, which took place after the
action of Aug. 13, there was
achieved the removal of the Dec.
13 deadline for signing a separate
peace treaty. It is impossible for
us to break off these explorations.
We cannot conduct the Western
Alliance on the troika principle.
We cannot repeat the mistake of
last summer. For that mistake
led to the Berlin wall.
THE SAME mistake now would
lead to the separate treaty, and
the nastiness of having to deal
with Herr Ulbricht.
It is blatantly untrue to say
that our willingness to negotiate
stems from weakness and irreso
lution. It stems from an increas
ingly clear realization that the
only conceivable way of protect
ing West Berlin and of achieving
an orderly development in all of
Germany, and security in Central
Europe, is to negotiate with the
Soviet Union.
The objectives of the West can
not bo achieved by war, which
would destroy all of Europe. They
cannot be achieved by threats or
by bluff or by deceiving ourselves
into thinking that if we bluff
grandly enough, Khrushchev will
not know that we are bluffing and
will then throw up his hands,

What wo know of the contro
versy in Moscow about “Stalin
ism” is rather like seeing the sec
ond act of a mystery play, having
missed the first act. Why, just
now, should Stalinism have be
come a burning issue? We can
only guess. Could it he because
the hardboiled line taken by Red
China, Albania, and Herr Ulbricht
in East Germany, is incompatible
with the paramount interest of
Khrushchev’s Russia, which is to
realize the Twenty-Year Plan of
internal development?
If that is the explanation, there
might some day be some very in
teresting events in East Germany,
such as the replacement of the
Stalinist Ulbricht by a Communist
of the type of Gomulka in Poland.
Needless to say, we must count
no chickens until they are
hatched.
The trouble inside the Western
Alliance is not nearly so impoi’-
tant as that between Red China
and the Soviet Union within the
Communist Alliance. For Rod
China is potentially a very dan
gerous rival, once it achieves in
dustrialization.
WITH ITS enormous popula
tion, its long and vague frontier
with the Soviet Union, it will in
not too many years be able to chal
lenge not only the leadership of
the Soviet Union in the Commu
nist world, but the defenses of
the Soviet Union on the continent
of Asia.
As compared with this, there is
no such deep issue in the Western
community about negotiation con
cerning Berlin. But there is a con
troversy and it is not negligible.
If it is neglected, it could fester
into something dangerous.
The crux of the Western con
troversy is this. We are commit
ted to the freedom of West Ber
lin, free access to West Berlin,
and a continuing military pres
ence of the Western powers in
West Berlin. But we are not com

negotiating, the action of Aug. 13
would not have taken place, at
least during the explorations.
In the Rusk-Gromyko explora
tion, which took place after the
action of Aug. 13, there was
achieved the removal of the Dec.
13 deadline for signing a separate
peace treaty. It is impossible for
us to break off these explorations.
We cannot conduct the Western
Alliance on the troika principle.
We cannot repeat the mistake of
last summer. For that mistake
led to the Berlin wall.
THE SAME mistake now would
lead to the separate treaty, and
the nastiness of having to deal
with Herr Ulbricht.
It is blatantly untrue to say
that our willingness to negotiate
stems from weakness and irreso
lution. It stems from an increas
ingly clear realization that the
only conceivable way of protect
ing West Berlin and of achieving
an orderly development in all of
Germany, and security in Central
Europe, is to negotiate with the
Soviet Union.
The objectives of the West can
not bo achieved by war, which
would destroy all of Europe. They
cannot be achieved by threats or
by bluff or by deceiving ourselves
into thinking that if we bluff
grandly enough, Khrushchev will
not know that we are bluffing and
will then throw up his hands,

What wo know of the contro
versy in Moscow about “Stalin
ism” is rather like seeing the sec
ond act of a mystery play, having
missed the first act. Why, just
now, should Stalinism have be
come a burning issue? We can
only guess. Could it he because
the hardboiled line taken by Red
China, Albania, and Herr Ulbricht
in East Germany, is incompatible
with the paramount interest of
Khrushchev’s Russia, which is to
realize the Twenty-Year Plan of
internal development?
If that is the explanation, there
might some day be some very in
teresting events in East Germany,
such as the replacement of the
Stalinist Ulbricht by a Communist
of the type of Gomulka in Poland.
Needless to say, we must count
no chickens until they are
hatched.
The trouble inside the Western
Alliance is not nearly so impoi’-
tant as that between Red China
and the Soviet Union within the
Communist Alliance. For Rod
China is potentially a very dan
gerous rival, once it achieves in
dustrialization.
WITH ITS enormous popula
tion, its long and vague frontier
with the Soviet Union, it will in
not too many years be able to chal
lenge not only the leadership of
the Soviet Union in the Commu
nist world, but the defenses of
the Soviet Union on the continent
of Asia.
As compared with this, there is
no such deep issue in the Western
community about negotiation con
cerning Berlin. But there is a con
troversy and it is not negligible.
If it is neglected, it could fester
into something dangerous.
The crux of the Western con
troversy is this. We are commit
ted to the freedom of West Ber
lin, free access to West Berlin,
and a continuing military pres
ence of the Western powers in
West Berlin. But we are not com
mitted irrevocably to the status
quo in all of Germany as it has
bon formulated in foreign policy
of Dr. Adenauer. We are commit
ted not to recognize the East Ger
man government. This commit
ment will be good unless the
Bonn government decides that
the most promising path to re
unification is to open up rela
tions with a post-Ulbricht govern
ment in East Germany.
BUT IN THE meantime we are
prepared to explore and, if the
terms seem satisfactory, to nego
tiate a wider settlement within
which the freedom of West Ber
lin can be assured by something
more than a perpetual willing
ness to unleash thermonuclear
war.

For this we are being called
appeasers, and we are warned
publicly by the French Ambassa
dor in Washington that we must
not wreck the Western Alliance.
Such threats, which imply that
the Western Alliance is very frag
ile, are coming from Paris and
from Bonn.
Their real purpose is to obtain!
a veto of all negotiations. The j
threats are unpleasant but they |
will prove to be unacceptable and i
unworkable. For if the United j
States has the ultimate power in |
the defense of the West, so it has j
the ultimate responsibility in the
issue of peace or war.
UXPKRIENC'F has shown how
costly can be the policy of refus
ing to negotiate, the policy not
only of standing pat but of sitting
down. Last summer when the
President had made the crucial
decision to stand firm at the risk
of war on our basic commitments
in West Berlin and to negotiate
on wider issues. Gen. de Gaulle
imposed a veto on negotiations.
Not long after that there took
place the action of Aug. 13 to
raise the wall in Berlin. In all
likelihood, had the West been al
lowed to explore the problem of
negotiating, the action of Aug. 13
would not have taken place, at
