PREVENTIVE WAR
Editor, Tile Daily:
I would like to disagree with a
statement in The Daily editorial
of Oct. 31. You state that the
benefits of our resumption of nu
clear testing would be far out
weighed by the dangers of such
tests, and ask why is further test
ing needed if our defenses actual
ly are adequate, as we have been
told during the past few weeks
by so many experts?
Our defense lias been adequate
because of the great test advan
tages that the United States has
had in the past. Now in the face
of the Russian tests and the dis
closures that Ihe Russians have
been testing secretly during the
test ban moratorium, the United
States has no other alternative
but to continue.
The wide bi-partisan support of
this view shows that it is not just
the foolish scheme of a small seg
ment of our population, but the
considered opinion of our scien
tists, military experts, and policy
makers.
I think that the statements
made by Sen. Richard Russell on
the front page of the Nov. 1 Daily
must be listened to. In fact, I
would urge that we go even fur
ther. We should perfect our nu
clear capability to the point that
we can launch a gigantic prevent
ive war, utterly annihilating what
we now know as Russia and Red
China.
Co-existence is impossible from
any side. International coopera
tion and mutual agreements have
failed miserably. Our enemy is
growing stronger, and is waiting
for the eventual day when he is
able to swallow us.
We cannot wait for this day,
but instead must prepare our
selves so that we may destroy
him with one massive attack. The
world conflict can be settled in no
other way.

BOMB PROTEST
Editor, The Daily:
In response to the letter by
Messrs. Doolin and Barnhart,- I
feel that they have misunderstood

the purpose and the cause of the
libe lawn vigil.
The vigil was a protest against
the principle of nuclear testing
and more strongly against that of
testing in the atmosphere. 1 would
like to point out that irrespective
of the cold war the principle is
wrong.
Therefore, even though the pe
tition would be unfair to the U.S.
in light of the Russian tests, we
still hold that nuclear testing is
undesirable and should be termi
nated for good.
The petition probably will not
deter any power from tier decided
plan. It is nevertheless a good ex
ample of how people can trans
cend the power polities of their
age for the cause of Man. Ridi
cule of this is natural but history
shall judge these people with a
different perspective.
All great movements are hatch
ed from ideas ahead of their time.
Consequently they are bound to
seem trivial and foolish to the
multitudes, at the outset.
The grouping together of paci
fists and JBS is inadequate. The
difference between the two is so
tremendous that if it could be
made to cover the whole range of
insanity then I doubt if there
would be any sanity left at all.
The pacifists are fighting
against a principle with a prin
ciple. Unlike most other move
ments it does not involve politics
or power play. Its strength comes
from a fathomless reservoir
which Gandhi called Truth.
Maninder Singh Dhagat
Editor, The Daily:
Without aligning with either of
the lunatic poles to which Messrs.
Doolin and Barnhart refer in their
letter of Nov. 1, I would like to
offer the following criticisms of
their general assumptions:
1. To say that “if the Soviet
Union persists in testing, we must
to likewise . . . ’’ neglects an im
portant distinction between Soviet

I capabilities and Soviet intentions.
If the two are in fact equal, (hen
the United States certainly should
launch a pre-emptive strike, for
thus it is only a matter of time
before the Soviet Union launches
its attack.
However, if the intentions of
the Soviet Union are not neces
sarily reflected in their nuclear
capabilities, which in fact is the
case, then for the United States
to resume its testing would only
serve to reinforce, in the ideolog
ically stereotyped minds in the
Kremlin, our image as “capitalist
warmongers,” and to further con
taminate the atmosphere.
2. To say that “we have reached
a stage in the escalation of the
cold war where further retreat
would be immoral” is to take a
rather restricted view of morali
ty; apparently to be "moral" one
must advance or escalate the cold
war.
However, since the ultimate re
sult of escalating the tension
level can only he nuclear war,
other “moralists,” among them
Paul Tillich of Harvard, would
question the justification for such
escalations.
Dr. Tillich states: “A war
fought with atomic weapons eth
ically cannot be justified, for it
produces destruction without the
possibility of a creative now be
ginning: it annihilates what it is
supposed to defend.”
3. To say that “there are evils
greater than thermo nuclear war,
one being the victory of commu
nism” is simply an inaccurate,
subjective generalization; com
munism certainly may be an evil,
hut at least it contains within it
the seeds of man’s goodness and
future growth that is, his very
existence. What virtue is there in
a world devoid of life?

PREVENTIVE WAR
Editor, Tile Daily:
I would like to disagree with a
statement in The Daily editorial
of Oct. 31. You state that the
benefits of our resumption of nu
clear testing would be far out
weighed by the dangers of such
tests, and ask why is further test
ing needed if our defenses actual
ly are adequate, as we have been
told during the past few weeks
by so many experts?
Our defense lias been adequate
because of the great test advan
tages that the United States has
had in the past. Now in the face
of the Russian tests and the dis
closures that Ihe Russians have
been testing secretly during the
test ban moratorium, the United
States has no other alternative
but to continue.
The wide bi-partisan support of
this view shows that it is not just
the foolish scheme of a small seg
ment of our population, but the
considered opinion of our scien
tists, military experts, and policy
makers.
I think that the statements
made by Sen. Richard Russell on
the front page of the Nov. 1 Daily
must be listened to. In fact, I
would urge that we go even fur
ther. We should perfect our nu
clear capability to the point that
we can launch a gigantic prevent
ive war, utterly annihilating what
we now know as Russia and Red
China.
Co-existence is impossible from
any side. International coopera
tion and mutual agreements have
failed miserably. Our enemy is
growing stronger, and is waiting
for the eventual day when he is
able to swallow us.
We cannot wait for this day,
but instead must prepare our
selves so that we may destroy
him with one massive attack. The
world conflict can be settled in no
other way.

Editor, The Daily:
In response to the letter by
Messrs. Doolin and Barnhart,- I
feel that they have misunderstood

the purpose and the cause of the
libe lawn vigil.
The vigil was a protest against
the principle of nuclear testing
and more strongly against that of
testing in the atmosphere. 1 would
like to point out that irrespective
of the cold war the principle is
wrong.
Therefore, even though the pe
tition would be unfair to the U.S.
in light of the Russian tests, we
still hold that nuclear testing is
undesirable and should be termi
nated for good.
The petition probably will not
deter any power from tier decided
plan. It is nevertheless a good ex
ample of how people can trans
cend the power polities of their
age for the cause of Man. Ridi
cule of this is natural but history
shall judge these people with a
different perspective.
All great movements are hatch
ed from ideas ahead of their time.
Consequently they are bound to
seem trivial and foolish to the
multitudes, at the outset.
The grouping together of paci
fists and JBS is inadequate. The
difference between the two is so
tremendous that if it could be
made to cover the whole range of
insanity then I doubt if there
would be any sanity left at all.
The pacifists are fighting
against a principle with a prin
ciple. Unlike most other move
ments it does not involve politics
or power play. Its strength comes
from a fathomless reservoir
which Gandhi called Truth.

Editor, The Daily:
Without aligning with either of
the lunatic poles to which Messrs.
Doolin and Barnhart refer in their
letter of Nov. 1, I would like to
offer the following criticisms of
their general assumptions:
1. To say that “if the Soviet
Union persists in testing, we must
to likewise . . . ’’ neglects an im
portant distinction between Soviet

I capabilities and Soviet intentions.
If the two are in fact equal, (hen
the United States certainly should
launch a pre-emptive strike, for
thus it is only a matter of time
before the Soviet Union launches
its attack.
However, if the intentions of
the Soviet Union are not neces
sarily reflected in their nuclear
capabilities, which in fact is the
case, then for the United States
to resume its testing would only
serve to reinforce, in the ideolog
ically stereotyped minds in the
Kremlin, our image as “capitalist
warmongers,” and to further con
taminate the atmosphere.
2. To say that “we have reached
a stage in the escalation of the
cold war where further retreat
would be immoral” is to take a
rather restricted view of morali
ty; apparently to be "moral" one
must advance or escalate the cold
war.
However, since the ultimate re
sult of escalating the tension
level can only he nuclear war,
other “moralists,” among them
Paul Tillich of Harvard, would
question the justification for such
escalations.

before the Soviet Union launches
its attack.
However, if the intentions of
the Soviet Union are not neces
sarily reflected in their nuclear
capabilities, which in fact is the
case, then for the United States
to resume its testing would only
serve to reinforce, in the ideolog
ically stereotyped minds in the
Kremlin, our image as “capitalist
warmongers,” and to further con
taminate the atmosphere.
2. To say that “we have reached
a stage in the escalation of the
cold war where further retreat
would be immoral” is to take a
rather restricted view of morali
ty; apparently to be "moral" one
must advance or escalate the cold
war.
However, since the ultimate re
sult of escalating the tension
level can only he nuclear war,
other “moralists,” among them
Paul Tillich of Harvard, would
question the justification for such
escalations.
Dr. Tillich states: “A war
fought with atomic weapons eth
ically cannot be justified, for it
produces destruction without the
possibility of a creative now be
ginning: it annihilates what it is
supposed to defend.”
3. To say that “there are evils
greater than thermo nuclear war,
one being the victory of commu
nism” is simply an inaccurate,
subjective generalization; com
munism certainly may be an evil,
hut at least it contains within it
the seeds of man’s goodness and
future growth that is, his very
existence. What virtue is there in
a world devoid of life?

PREVENTIVE WAR
Editor, Tile Daily:
I would like to disagree with a
statement in The Daily editorial
of Oct. 31. You state that the
benefits of our resumption of nu
clear testing would be far out
weighed by the dangers of such
tests, and ask why is further test
ing needed if our defenses actual
ly are adequate, as we have been
told during the past few weeks
by so many experts?
Our defense lias been adequate
because of the great test advan
tages that the United States has
had in the past. Now in the face
of the Russian tests and the dis
closures that Ihe Russians have
been testing secretly during the
test ban moratorium, the United
States has no other alternative
but to continue.
The wide bi-partisan support of
this view shows that it is not just
the foolish scheme of a small seg
ment of our population, but the
considered opinion of our scien
tists, military experts, and policy
makers.
I think that the statements
made by Sen. Richard Russell on
the front page of the Nov. 1 Daily
must be listened to. In fact, I
would urge that we go even fur
ther. We should perfect our nu
clear capability to the point that
we can launch a gigantic prevent
ive war, utterly annihilating what
we now know as Russia and Red
China.
Co-existence is impossible from
any side. International coopera
tion and mutual agreements have
failed miserably. Our enemy is
growing stronger, and is waiting
for the eventual day when he is
able to swallow us.
We cannot wait for this day,
but instead must prepare our
selves so that we may destroy
him with one massive attack. The
world conflict can be settled in no
other way.

BOMB PROTEST
Editor, The Daily:
In response to the letter by
Messrs. Doolin and Barnhart,- I
feel that they have misunderstood

the purpose and the cause of the
libe lawn vigil.
The vigil was a protest against
the principle of nuclear testing
and more strongly against that of
testing in the atmosphere. 1 would
like to point out that irrespective
of the cold war the principle is
wrong.
Therefore, even though the pe
tition would be unfair to the U.S.
in light of the Russian tests, we
still hold that nuclear testing is
undesirable and should be termi
nated for good.
The petition probably will not
deter any power from tier decided
plan. It is nevertheless a good ex
ample of how people can trans
cend the power polities of their
age for the cause of Man. Ridi
cule of this is natural but history
shall judge these people with a
different perspective.
All great movements are hatch
ed from ideas ahead of their time.
Consequently they are bound to
seem trivial and foolish to the
multitudes, at the outset.
The grouping together of paci
fists and JBS is inadequate. The
difference between the two is so
tremendous that if it could be
made to cover the whole range of
insanity then I doubt if there
would be any sanity left at all.
The pacifists are fighting
against a principle with a prin
ciple. Unlike most other move
ments it does not involve politics
or power play. Its strength comes
from a fathomless reservoir
which Gandhi called Truth.
