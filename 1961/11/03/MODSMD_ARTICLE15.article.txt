## Britain Must Turn to The Common Market 
### TOM GREY 
Within recent months, Great
Britain has taken the first tenta
tive steps toward joining the Eu
ropean Common Market. In July,
Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
announced that his country would,
“at an early date,” open negotia

tions with the six nations of the
Economic Community.
This fall the step was actually
taken, and last month at its an
nual conference in Blackpool, the
Labor Party affirmed the govern
ment’s policy, assuring that even
in the event of a change of admin
istration England will not turn
away from the path on which she
is now embarked.

This change in England’s his
toric policy of isolation from the
Continent was not effected with
out pressures from behind, and
obstacles from the front.

THE BRITISH economy has
been beset by difficulties since the
end of World War 11. During that
period England’s exports have not
kept pace with her imports. Con
sequently, she is faced with a
chronic shortage of the foreign
currencies she needs so desperate
ly in order to buy the necessities
of life.

This year the British govern
ment was forced to apply for the
largest loan in the history of the
International Monetary Fund to
support the troubled pound.

Either as a result or a cause of
this foreign trade imbalance, Brit
ish industry has been relatively
stagnant during the postwar peri
od.

WHILE THE Western Europe
an economy as a whole has under
gone a surge which has been one
of the wonders of the midcentury
world, England has had the lowest
economic growth rate of any of
the major industrial nations.
A series of crippling crises have
kept British industry from achiev
ing any major capital expansion
which has led to the loss of tradi
tional overseas markets to more
dynamic producers.

The most recent of these reces
sions, in the spring and summer
of this year, led to the final real
ization on the part of many mem
bers of the government that the
only solution lay in the very Eu
ropean Common Market which
they had previously rejected and
indeed opposed with all their re
sources from its inception.

CHANCELLOR OF the Exchec
quer Selwyn Lloyd’s “austerity”
budget, brought out in July, was
widely criticised as a temporary
measure, not striking at the real
roots of the problem.

Britain’s own Outer Seven, the
European Free Trade Association,
composed of non-Common Market
nations, was attacked as a failure
a loose, make-shift customs
union whose only purpose was the
sterile one of opposing the Six,
With the entry of Britain into
the EEC it was believed, British
industry would again become
price-competitive in its traditional
markets on the Continent, and at
the same time get a needed boost
from the competition of the mod
ern, efficient manufacturers of
West Germany and the other

countries of the Six.
HOWEVER, even the argument
of economic necessity was not
enough to convince many English
men of both major parties that
they had to join Europe.
Many Conservatives, deeply
committed to the imperial ideal,
were opposed to anything that
might necessitate any removal of
the trade prerogatives of the Com
monwealth countries, as could oc
cur with the Common Market
policy of internal free trade, and
a common external tariff.
Laborites feared an influx of
“cheap Italian labor” which would
rob “honest Englishmen” of jobs.
Both parties feared the effect of
free trade and competition on the
heavily protected and politically
influential British agricultural
bloc.

IN ADDITION, a kind of mys
tical idea that England is some
how apart from and above the pol
itics of the Continent still exists
in the minds of many Englishmen.
But the leaders of both parties
seem to finally be convinced, even
if with many reservations, that
the only way to financial salva
tion for England lies through Eu
rope.

Whether this opinion is shai'ed
by the majority of the British elec
torate, and what effect member
ship in the EEC might have on
England and on the Mai'ket itself
remains to be seen.
