## Libe lawn Campout Criticized 
### ROSS HERMANN 
Several girls with long, stringy
hair, palid faces, and feet in san
dals sat in a circle Monday night
in front of the Main Library and
to the flickering light of a leering
pumpkin played flutes and whee
zy recorders.
They seemed to be acting out a
primitive ritual, and the mystical
sound they issued was like some
thing out of the heart of Asia
rather than Stanford, U.S.A.
The purpose of their ritual was
evident—to drive away the evil
spirits, that is, the invisible par
ticle of radioactive dust that they
imagined would fall on them soon
from Russia’s 50-megaton bomb.
BUT NONE OF them had any
optimism that the ritual would
work. The girls turned sad faces
towaxd a dreadful sky, a fellow
on the outside of the circle apa
thetically tapped out x’hythm as
if it wei’e sapping away his
st length, and other members of
the clan merely curled up and
went to sleep.
These charactei’istics seemed to
bespeak a general attitude of
doom and made the whole pro
ceeding into a futile escape from
the serious realities of 20th Cen
tury life.
What is hard to imagine Is that
a protest against Soviet nuclear
(testing by intelligent Stanford
students should take such an in
effective form. Certainly, they
should have been able to figure
out a more constructive course of
action, based on the assumption
that all is not lost.
INSTEAD OF pleading with Ni
kita Khrushchev fox - mei’cy, these
students should have urged Pres
ident Kennedy to resume atmos
pheric nuclear testing, perhaps
in the arctic region where, given
certain conditions, fallout might
spx-ead over populous areas of the
Soviet Union.
Then the United States could
offer to negotiate a pei’manent
ban on nuclear testing. The
chances ai’e that the Soviet Un
ion would be convinced of the
necessity for such a ban and
would gladly accept it.
Nothing short of such action—
certainly no amount, of petition
ing or pleading—will bxdng about
the desired result.
IN THEIR defeatist attitude
toward the problems of the mod
ern age, the students who camped
out on the library lawn seem to
be the personification of the fail
ure of a type of thought which is
all too prevalent at this and other
universities.
That thought is marked by the
rejection of the existence of a
supreme being and the belief in
the ability of men, guided merely
by their intelligence, to master
the problems of evil—in effect to
change human nature.
Recent events have shattered
their faith in men, and lacking
faith in a supreme being, these
students had nowhere to turn in
their disillusionment but to the
making of magical sounds.
It is to be hoped that responsi
ble students will see the futility
in this type of thought and action
and will seek more constructive,
optimistic approaches to world
problems.

That thought is marked by the
rejection of the existence of a
supreme being and the belief in
the ability of men, guided merely
by their intelligence, to master
the problems of evil—in effect to
change human nature.
Recent events have shattered
their faith in men, and lacking
faith in a supreme being, these
students had nowhere to turn in
their disillusionment but to the
making of magical sounds.
It is to be hoped that responsi
ble students will see the futility
in this type of thought and action
and will seek more constructive,
optimistic approaches to world
problems.
Several girls with long, stringy
hair, palid faces, and feet in san
dals sat in a circle Monday night
in front of the Main Library and
to the flickering light of a leering
pumpkin played flutes and whee
zy recorders.
They seemed to be acting out a
primitive ritual, and the mystical
sound they issued was like some
thing out of the heart of Asia
rather than Stanford, U.S.A.
The purpose of their ritual was
evident—to drive away the evil
spirits, that is, the invisible par
ticle of radioactive dust that they
imagined would fall on them soon
from Russia’s 50-megaton bomb.
BUT NONE OF them had any
optimism that the ritual would
work. The girls turned sad faces
towaxd a dreadful sky, a fellow
on the outside of the circle apa
thetically tapped out x’hythm as
if it wei’e sapping away his
st length, and other members of
the clan merely curled up and
went to sleep.
These charactei’istics seemed to
bespeak a general attitude of
doom and made the whole pro
ceeding into a futile escape from
the serious realities of 20th Cen
tury life.
What is hard to imagine Is that
a protest against Soviet nuclear
(testing by intelligent Stanford
students should take such an in
effective form. Certainly, they
should have been able to figure
out a more constructive course of
action, based on the assumption
that all is not lost.
INSTEAD OF pleading with Ni
kita Khrushchev fox - mei’cy, these
students should have urged Pres
ident Kennedy to resume atmos
pheric nuclear testing, perhaps
in the arctic region where, given
certain conditions, fallout might
spx-ead over populous areas of the
Soviet Union.
Then the United States could
offer to negotiate a pei’manent
ban on nuclear testing. The
chances ai’e that the Soviet Un
ion would be convinced of the
necessity for such a ban and
would gladly accept it.
Nothing short of such action—
certainly no amount, of petition
ing or pleading—will bxdng about
the desired result.

toward the problems of the mod

out on the library lawn seem to
