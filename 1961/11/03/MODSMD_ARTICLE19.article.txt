# Improved Frosh Eleven to Face Favored Cal in 'Little Big Game'
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Stanford’s frosh football squad
will meet its most severe test of
the season tomorrow in Berkeley
against a Cal frosh team reported
to be the best ever on the West
Coast. Game time is 10:30 a.m.
Freshman coach Dan Stavely
took a cautiously optimistic view
of the game's outcome. “They’re
not vastly better than we are,”
he said. “If they don’t got a couple
of cheap scores on us, we’ll stay
in there with them.”
STAVELY had only one word
for Cal quarterback Craig Mor
ton, “fabulous.” He indicated that
Morton’s deep passes might hurt
the Papooses.
“We haven’t looked too good on
pass defense. They’ll hit us where
we’re weak. We’ll try to keep the

ball on the ground and to main
tain possession,” said the frosh
mentor.

Stavely was still enthusiastic
over his charges’ 41-12 conquest
of UCLA, which gave them a 2-1
record going into the Cal game.

The Papooses also own a 33-6 tri
umph over the San Jose State
frosh, and were 13-12 victims of
the USC freshmen.
The frosh have been plagued by
fumbles throughout the season.
They hobbled the ball nine times
against UCLA, but fortunately
the Bruins were not able to capi
talize on the situation. Fumbles
reportedly were responsible for

the Papooses’ loss to USC.
ON THE POSITIVE side, the
squad is knee deep in speedy half
backs, with Bucky Rosen; J. D.
Lodato and Morrison Warren the
standouts to date. Bob Rath holds
down the fullback position in fine
style, and calling the signals are
Dick Ragsdale and Dick Berg.
Ragsdale leads the team in
rushing with 173 yards in 19 car
ries for an 8.42-yard average. He
has completed 13 of 22 passes for
215 yards and two touchdowns.
Lodato has carried the ball just
eight times but has rambled for
113 yards and an 13.88-yard aver
age.
Stavely characterized his line as
“a little tougher than they (Cal)
are.” Bulwarking the offensive
wall are center Stan Tarter,
tackle John Wilbur and guard Joe
Neal. Leading a rough and rugged
defensive charge are Neal atid
Duke Samson.
Neal tops the club with 20
tackles followed by guard Jack
Chappie with 12. Samson and Wil
bur have 11 apiece.
The frosh have not had a seri
ous injury all season, and will be
at full strength tomorrow. “They
(Cal) will bo favored on the basis
of their squad,” said Stavely. “but
I think we can win it. I feel pretty
good about the game.”

Today is the last chance to
sign up for the bus caravan
to the Little Big Game at Cal
tomorrow. Signup lists are in
front of the cellar and in
frosh residences. An all-cam
pus rally will be held in front
of the Civ Lib at 4 p.m.

the season tomorrow in Berkeley
against a Cal frosh team reported
to be the best ever on the West
Coast. Game time is 10:30 a.m.
Freshman coach Dan Stavely
took a cautiously optimistic view
of the game's outcome. “They’re
not vastly better than we are,”
he said. “If they don’t got a couple
of cheap scores on us, we’ll stay
in there with them.”
STAVELY had only one word
for Cal quarterback Craig Mor
ton, “fabulous.” He indicated that
Morton’s deep passes might hurt
the Papooses.
“We haven’t looked too good on
pass defense. They’ll hit us where
we’re weak. We’ll try to keep the

ball on the ground and to main
tain possession,” said the frosh
mentor.

Stavely was still enthusiastic
over his charges’ 41-12 conquest
of UCLA, which gave them a 2-1
record going into the Cal game.

The Papooses also own a 33-6 tri
umph over the San Jose State
frosh, and were 13-12 victims of
the USC freshmen.
The frosh have been plagued by
fumbles throughout the season.
They hobbled the ball nine times
against UCLA, but fortunately
the Bruins were not able to capi
talize on the situation. Fumbles
reportedly were responsible for

the Papooses’ loss to USC.
ON THE POSITIVE side, the
squad is knee deep in speedy half
backs, with Bucky Rosen; J. D.
Lodato and Morrison Warren the
standouts to date. Bob Rath holds
down the fullback position in fine
style, and calling the signals are
Dick Ragsdale and Dick Berg.
Ragsdale leads the team in
rushing with 173 yards in 19 car
ries for an 8.42-yard average. He
has completed 13 of 22 passes for
215 yards and two touchdowns.
Lodato has carried the ball just
eight times but has rambled for
113 yards and an 13.88-yard aver
age.
Stavely characterized his line as
“a little tougher than they (Cal)
are.” Bulwarking the offensive
wall are center Stan Tarter,
tackle John Wilbur and guard Joe
Neal. Leading a rough and rugged
defensive charge are Neal atid
Duke Samson.
Neal tops the club with 20
tackles followed by guard Jack
Chappie with 12. Samson and Wil
bur have 11 apiece.
The frosh have not had a seri
ous injury all season, and will be
at full strength tomorrow. “They
(Cal) will bo favored on the basis
of their squad,” said Stavely. “but
I think we can win it. I feel pretty
good about the game.”

Today is the last chance to
sign up for the bus caravan
to the Little Big Game at Cal
tomorrow. Signup lists are in
front of the cellar and in
frosh residences. An all-cam
pus rally will be held in front
of the Civ Lib at 4 p.m.
Stanford’s frosh football squad
will meet its most severe test of
