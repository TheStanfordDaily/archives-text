# Walker Quits Army Post

### 
WASHINGTON ( UPI i Maj.
Gen. Edwin A. Walker, a central
figure in the military “muzzling”
controversy, said yesterday he is
quitting the Army to continue his
anti-Communist fight as a civil
ian.
Walker made the announce
ment in a statement sent to the
Senate military preparedness sub
committee, which plans to begin
hearings on censorship of military
officers late this month.
Walker was commander of the
Army’s 24th Division in Germany
when he was relieved and repri
manded because of complaints
about his troop indoctrination pro
gram and his efforts to influence
the votes of his men during the
1960 election.
Critics said the program was
founded on principles of the right
wing John Birch Society. Walker
and his supporters said it was a
legitimate program of education
for men unschooled in methods of
the Communist conspiracy.
Walker recently was reassigned
to the Army’s Pacific headquar
ters in Hawaii. But the statement
to the committee made clear he
decided not to continue in uni
form.
