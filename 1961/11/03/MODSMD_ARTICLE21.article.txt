course.
Coach Payton Jordan says that
Stanford is much improved this
time and stands an excellent
chance to pull an upset.
“This matter of team running
is crucial in a cross country race,”
said Jordan. “San Jose ran more
as a team than we did last time.
However, we're capable of better
running, and our two weeks of
training ought to be a big factor
in the meet.”
The team received a boost re
cently when Rich Klier made it
back on the varsity squad. Klier,
number one man last year, had
been out with an injury. He has
run the course eight seconds fast
er than last year.

more Bill Pratt, leading runner
this season and second to Klier
last year.
The main burden of team run
ning, according to Jordan, will
fall on the four freshmen —Weym
Kirkland, Paul Schlicke, Harlan
Andrews and Dave Steinbeck.

Also on tho seven-man team will
be sophomore Dave Shafer.

Stanford will race a total of 15
men, only seven being eligible for
points, Tho other will be out to
boat one of the top seven and thus
gain a slot on the team for next
week.

“The boys are getting into
shape real well. We've saved our
veterans for this big meet, and I
believe that wo can upset San
Jose,” Jordan said.
