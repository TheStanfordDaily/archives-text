# Indians to Battle Crippled Ducks
## 
### ROY SCHMIDT 
Defense will bo the key if Stan
ford's Indians are to stop the
speedy Oregon Ducks from col
lecting their third straight win
tomorrow in the Stadium. Post
time is 1:30 p.rn.
The Indians, now boasting as
fine a defense as they have shown I
in recent years, can’t seem to pul I
together an offense that will go. [
They have not scored a point in
two weeks, the first time this has |
happened to a Stanford team !
since 1954.
THE FACT that the Cards are j
without three of their lop offen- I
sive ball players may have some
thing to do with it. Stove Thur- j
low, the loader in total offense,
will be in the stands tomorrow I
with what the doctors are hesi
tant to call mononucleosis.
Also missing are Larry Royse, '

the only one of the regular Stan
ford ball carriers that could be
called a scattaack, and Hal Steu
her, the number-one fullback.
Hoping to perk up the attack.
Coach Jack Curtice has shifted
Jim Smith, a converted quarter
back, from right to left half and
Mike Barnes from left to right
half.
THF DEFENSE will be trying
to contain a team very much like
Washington- a lot of speed and
a good experienced line. The
Cards will have to stop the out
side running of Oregon speed
sters Lu Bain and Mel Renfro.
Curtice is expected to use the
same defensive lineup that hold
the Big Five’s most potent of
fense, UCLA, to just 178 yards,
well under their game average.
The Cards used a seven and
eight-man line with the three

halfbacks in very tight. Against
the Ducks, Curtice will have to
loosen it up, especially if injured
quarterback Doug Post is able to
play. Post has clicked on 34 of 78
passes for 504 yards and three
TD’s.

THK STANFORD front line de
fensively will consist of George
Honore and Steve Pursell at ends;
C. B. Simons and Frank Atkinson,
tackles; and Marv Harris and Er
rol Scott at guards.

The Indians have a pair of rug
ged linebackers in Ed Cummings
and John Butler who are tied for
team lead with 46 tackles apiece.
Both were cited by Curtice for
their play against the Bruins.

The secondary will consist of
Gary Craig. Gary Sargent and
Danny Spence.

OREGON may go into the
game without two of their big of
fensive threats in Post and Ren
fro. The Ducks were already thin
at quarterback and now Post is a
doubtful starter. If he can’t make
it, Ron Veres, an unknown junior
will get the start.

Renfro, hailed as one of the
most promising backs in the
country, was injured in the sec
ond game and hasn’t been the
same since. He has been limping
badly in practice and probably
will not he ready for the Cards.

Lu Bain, another sophomore
flash, has been filling his shoes
adequately though and can be ex
pected to be among the starters
tomorrow.

l ! P FRONT the Ducks are big,
fast, and experienced. They will
open with Kent Petersen anil
Greg Willener at ends; Ron Sni
dow and Steve Barnett, tackles;
A1 Weigel and Mickey Ording,
guards; and Rich Dixon, center.
The remainder of the backfield
combo will be Mike Gaechter at
right half and Jim Josephson at
full.
With tackle A1 Hildebrand and
Ken Baba.jian working out in
practice, the Cards' medical pic
ture is improved considerably.


MICKEY ORDING bulwarks a big, fast, and experienced Oregon line
which will square off against the Indians tomorrow in the Stadium.
Ording, 6-0, 211 pounds, is quick and very aggressive.


ED CUMMINGS will stick primarily to defense tomorrow as the Stan
ford unit gets a big test against the Oregon Ducks. Cummings, a
linebacker, is tied with John Butler for team lead in tackles with 46.
