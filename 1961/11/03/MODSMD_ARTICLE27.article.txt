# Winless Indians Host SF State Soccermen
## 
### STEVE GRAND-JEAN 
A determined Stanford soccer
team will shoot for its first win
tomorrow when it hosts San Fran
cisco State at 2:30 p.m.
Card Coach Fred Priddle felt
that the well-balanced State at
tack would present some prob
lems to his fast-improving back
field. “Their mediocre record is
not indicative of their true
strength,” he pointed out.
Priddle said his own team was
“ready to jell and pick up a
game.” The Indians will open
with Dave Dierdoff at goalie; Ed
Earner and Rich Lonegan, full
backs; Bill Hatch, Don Burr and
co-captain Rusty Williams, half
backs; and a front line of Ro
berto Santa Cruz, Larry Chuk
wudebe, Emannual Andah, Albert
Nnoli and co-captain Mel Tippett.
Priddle expects a better show
ing after last weekend’s loss to
University of San Francisco. His
defense, which has been hit by
many personnel losses, managed
to keep the ball in the opponents’
territory a good deal of the time.
“Had our forwards capitalized

on two or three easy scoring op
portunities, it might have been a
different game.”
The Stanford freshmen, still un
scored upon, face the State frosh
at 11 a.m. and the JV’s clash at
1 p.m.
