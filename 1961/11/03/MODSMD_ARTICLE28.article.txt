# Lions to Use 'Zephyr' Lineup Against 49'ers
## 
### 
By United Press International
The Detroit Lions, who have
been staggering along with a
punchless offense, shoot their new
“zephyr” attack at the San Fran
cisco Forty-Niners Sunday in an
effort to stay in the National
Football League championship
race.
The “zephyr” is a four-flanker
offense dreamed up by coach
George Wilson because the Lions'
attack has averaged only 15
points a game this season.
Wilson’s formation, a gimmick
like the “shotgun” popularized by
the Forty-Niners, is designed pri
marily for passing. It puts quar
terback Jim Ninowski under cen
ter with only fullback Nick Pie
trosante behind him. The half
backs, Terry Barr and Olympic
hurdler Glenn Davis, are flanked
wide along with the ends, Gail
Cogdill and Jim Gibbons.
For both Detroit and San Fran
cisco, this is a “must” game. Each
has been beaten three times and
NFL experts regard this as the
maximum number of games a
title contender can afford to lose.
In an earlier meeting, the Forty-
Niners clobbered the Lions, 49-0.
