# U.S. Readies Atmospheric Bomb Tests
## 
### 
By United Press International
President Kennedy announced
yesterday that the United States
is preparing to resume nuclear
tests in the air and will start the
explosions if they are deemed
necessary to protect the free
world.
Meanwhile at the Vnited Na
tions in New York, Russia reject
ed proposals for a now moratori
um on nuclear weapons testing.
Soviet Delegate Semyon K. Tsar
apkin, in a speech before I he Gen
eral Assembly’s Main Political
Committee, said only the “over
whelming might” of the Soviet
Union can cool off the “warlike
maniacs” in the West.
KENNEDY, with the approval
of key members of Congress, de
clared that above-ground tests
will be ordered if a current study
of Russia’s explosions show such
action is needed to maintain a nu
clear advantage over the Soviets.
Kennedy pledged that the Unit
ed States would hold fallout from
any atmospheric tests to an “ab
solute minimum.” He said he had
no intention of exploding any
thing like the 50-megaton bomb
which Russia set off “in complete
disregard for the welfare of man
kind.”
A few hours later the Atomic
Energy Commission announced
that the Soviets yesterday had
detonated two more nuclear de
vices, both in the “low to inter
mediate” range.
IN' NEW YOKK Tsarapkin said,
“All will surely understand that
the fears felt by some about radi
ation can in no way be compared
to the monstrous consequences
for mankind of the military use
of nuclear weapons.”
The Soviet bloc, he said, is “ca
pable of repelling with arms any
combination of aggressors” and
ho warned the world is moving
toward a nuclear conflict if the
Western powers “do not stop
their mad race toward war.”
The U.N. resolution which was
rejected by Russia yesterday is
sponsored by India and five other
countries and calls for an un-in
spected moratorium against all
atomic tests. The resolution is
also opposed by the United States
because Russia could not be
trusted to abide by such a volun
tary policy, said chief U.S, nego
tiator on a nuclear test ban and
delegate to the United Nations,
Arthur H. Dean Wednesday.

clared that above-ground tests
will be ordered if a current study
of Russia’s explosions show such
action is needed to maintain a nu
clear advantage over the Soviets.
Kennedy pledged that the Unit
ed States would hold fallout from
any atmospheric tests to an “ab
solute minimum.” He said he had
no intention of exploding any
thing like the 50-megaton bomb
which Russia set off “in complete
disregard for the welfare of man
kind.”
A few hours later the Atomic
Energy Commission announced
that the Soviets yesterday had
detonated two more nuclear de
vices, both in the “low to inter
mediate” range.
IN' NEW YOKK Tsarapkin said,
“All will surely understand that
the fears felt by some about radi
ation can in no way be compared
to the monstrous consequences
for mankind of the military use
of nuclear weapons.”
The Soviet bloc, he said, is “ca
pable of repelling with arms any
combination of aggressors” and
ho warned the world is moving
toward a nuclear conflict if the
Western powers “do not stop
their mad race toward war.”
The U.N. resolution which was
rejected by Russia yesterday is
sponsored by India and five other
countries and calls for an un-in
spected moratorium against all
atomic tests. The resolution is
also opposed by the United States
because Russia could not be
trusted to abide by such a volun
tary policy, said chief U.S, nego
tiator on a nuclear test ban and
delegate to the United Nations,
Arthur H. Dean Wednesday.

Committee, said only the “over
whelming might” of the Soviet
Union can cool off the “warlike
maniacs” in the West.
