Two Stanford students riding

jured at noon yesterday when

they collided with a car at Galvez
and Campus Drive. One required
surgery but is now in good con

Sophomore Philip Rehbock. 19,
and senior Donald Patterson, 21,
were thrown to the hood of the
car. Patterson fell off immediate
ly, but Rehbock smashed the
windshield with his head and rode
the car for about 50 feet before
falling off.

The car, driven by Jack Gold
man of Los Altos, plunged about
75 feet into a field and grazed a
tree before coming to rest. Gold
man and his passenger, Mrs.
Helen Abbot, of Millbrae, wore
treated at the scene for minor
cuts and bruises.

Rehbock suffered deep skull
cuts and spent two and one-half
hours in the operating room of
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital.
Nurses reported last night that
he was in “good” condition.
Patterson was treated for cuts
and bruises and released.

No citations have been issued
but police are continuing their in
vestigation of the accident. One
policeman said he had “never had
so many witnesses’’ at an acci
dent before.

Police said the students could
probably have been released im
mediately if they had been wear
ing crash helmets. They said
crash helmets should be manda
tory for all riders of two-wheeled
motor vehicles, as they are in Eu
rope and Canada.
