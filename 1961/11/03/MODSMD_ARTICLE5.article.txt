# China Is "Liberating"

### MIKE WIESENBERG 
India’s leading population ex
pert last night said that "libera
tion has come to China with a ven
geance.”
Speaking to a Cubberley Audi
torium audience, Dr. Sripati
Chandra-Sekhar told of his recent
travels behind the Bamboo Cur
tain and of what he saw there.
The China of today has an aura
of dull uniformity, he said. Every
one wears a blue uniform, because
this color was once associated
with the plebeian masses. “The
übiquitous radio and loudspeaker
are everywhere.” said Dr. Chan
dra-sekhar, constantly broadcast
ing government regulations and
propaganda.
“You are constantly exhorted
to be a good Communist, told how
to sleep and so on.” Dr. Chandra
sekhar said he went to the Gobi
Desert and thought that there,
finally, he could escape the omni
present loudspeaker. At one place
all that was in sight was a lone
tree. On top of it was a loud
speaker.
He said that public health and
sanitation have come to Red Chi
na to such an extent that one no
longer sees flies, even in what
used to be slums. Dr. Chandra
sekhar did see one fly in a diner.
“Immediately fifty fly swatters
materialized,” said the Doctor,
“and so died the last fly in Chi
na.”
Dr. Chandra-sekhar finished by
emphasizing that we do not fur
ther our interests in the world by
boycotting and isolating Commu
nist China. We must learn to un
derstand that country, he said,
and in so doing assure the un
committed millions the world
over that our way of life is bettor.
