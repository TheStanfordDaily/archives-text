# 76 Frosh Confess Guilt
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Editor 
Soventy-six freshmen involved
in the full moon incident on Quad
two weeks ago turned themselves
in to the Freshman Men’s Coun
cil after a request from Legisla
ture to do so.
This report was given to
LASSU last night by Jerry Putt
ier, head sponsor at Wilbur Hall.
Puttier told the legislators that
the freshmen “are anxious to ac
cept the responsibility and make
any retribution” they can to pay
for the damage caused by the in
cident.
Ho said the Council decided to
levy a fine on each person who
was on Quad that night, but to
take no other disciplinary action.
Damage to flower beds and a

window came to $99.40. The Coun
cil charged each of the approxi
mately 150 frosh on Quad during
the disturbance about 70 cents to
pay for the damage. Puttier said
about $80 had been collected so
far and the money was still com
ing in.
As another example of the
“good attitude in the freshman
class,” he revealed that the fresh
man who wrote a letter to The
Daily and signed another person’s
name to it voluntarily turned him
self In to the Council.
In other action, ASSU President
Bob Sayler set up four commit
tees to determine how students
can make their ideas and opinions
felt in the University. Tryouts
for three of the committees will
be soon, with the first tryouts
1 slated for Monday.
