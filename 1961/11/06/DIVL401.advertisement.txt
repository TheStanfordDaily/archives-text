Bright futures in data transmission at W. E.
New engineers with initiative who can meet
Western Electric’s high standards are offered
many exciting career opportunities with our
company in data processing development work
as it relates to communications.
For example, Western’s engineers—working
closely with Bell Telephone Laboratories—have
solved development and manufacturing prob
lems connected with the Bell System’s new
DATA-PHONE Data set (made bv Western
Electric). DATA-PHONE service lets business
machines, such as computers, “speak" to each
other ina language of numbers and symbols over
existing telephone communication networks.
Tins represents a tremendous boon to business;
and consequently, it is estimated that some day
there may be more machine talk than people
talk using telephone lines.
Of course, data communications is only one
of many rewarding career areas that await
you at Western Electric. Here are just a few
of the others: electronic switching . . . solid
state electronic devices . . . microwave radio
relay.. .computer-programmed production lines
... solar cells ... optical masers .. . futuristic
telephones.
We need high-caliber, forward-thinking en
gineers now to help us transform these plans
into realities or to work with us in scores of
other key communications areas. Your future,
the future of Western Electric, and the future
of America’s communications—could well de
pend on your first career connection.
Challenging opportunities exist now at Western
Electric for electrical, mechanical, industrial, and chemi
cal engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts,
and business majors. All qualified applicants will re
ceive careful consideration for employment without
regard to race, creed, color or national origin. For mote

Electric). DATA-PHONE service lets business
machines, such as computers, “speak" to each

talk using telephone lines.
