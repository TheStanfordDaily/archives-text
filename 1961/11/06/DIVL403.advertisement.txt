WHAT DOES AN OLD GRAD LIKE BEST ABOUT HOMECOMING? Next to shaking
hands, he likes reminiscing. About fraternity parties, girls, sorority parties, girls,
off-campus parties, girls— and, of course, about how great cigarettes used to
taste. Fortunately for you, Luckies still do taste great. (So great that college
students smoke more of them than any other regular cigarette.) Which shows
that the important things in college life stay the same. Parties. Girls. Luckies.
CHANGE TO LUCKIES and get some for a change!
