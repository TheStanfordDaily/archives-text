# DOUGLAS:
## U.S., Russia Can Agree On Berlin 
### BOSS HERMANN 
Sen. Paul Douglas, Democrat
of Illinois, said in a Memorial
Auditorium appearance Friday
that (he United States must pur
sue a “policy of purpose without
provocation” in meeting the Ber
lin crisis.
IN OUTLINING that policy,
Douglas said he considered five
points lion-negotiable in any fu
ture dealings with the Soviet
Union.
• There shall be no reduction
in the size of the allied garrison
in West Berlin.
• The right of allied access to
West Berlin and to East Berlin
shall be maintained.
• Access of West Berlin civil
ians to West Germany shall be
protected.
• The currency of West Berlin
shall continue to be tied to that
of West Germany, in order to
protect West Berlin’s economy.
• Under no conditions shall
refugees bo returned to East Ger
many.
DOUGLAS declared that these
are the positions from which the
United States cannot retreat. He
felt that certain concessions can
be made in negotiations with Rus
sia without effecting these mini
mum stands, but he said that it
would bo a mistake to reveal
these prior to negotiations.
In discussing the Berlin prob
lem, Douglas applied the lessons
of World War II to the present
situation.
“When an aggressor attacks,
you do not appease him. If you
do, you finally come to the ques
tion, ‘Are you going to resist or
are you going to submit?’”
COMPARING the present ag
gressor with the aggressor in
World War 11, Douglas concluded
that Communists are more dan
gerous than Nazis.
“Hitler made no appeal to noble
idealism but was blatant and
forthright in his motives. Com
munists disguise themselves with
an appeal to idealism and draw
many serious, dedicated people to
their ranks.”
Douglas stated that if the
United States were to retreat in
Berlin, the consequences would
be as serious as those following
Munich. “It would not stop there.
Russia would demand the neu
tralization of Germany, then the
expulsion of U.S. troops from
Europe. We would then retreat
to a fortress America, and the
world would close in on us.”
THE SENATOR viewed the
present Berlin crisis as a test of
the determination of the United
States and its allies. He said that
the pattern of Communist strate
gy over the last 15 years has been
to probe for weakness and then
to push forward in areas where
it is found.
He concluded that the stand
against Communism must be
made in Berlin. The question, he
said, is not whether Berlin is
worth defending or whether it is
militarily defensible.
“Berlin is merely the place
where opposing forces and ideol
ogies have met.”
IN ANSWERING questions
from the floor, Douglas said that
he is opposed to the admission of
Red China to the United Nations
because that government is “not
constitutionally qualified for
membership.”
