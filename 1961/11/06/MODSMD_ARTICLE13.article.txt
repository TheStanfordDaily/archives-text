# The 						Self-Appointed Censors Hit Again
## 
### 
The self-appointed censors are on the rampage again—this time
against Henry Miller’s “Tropic of Cancer.”

Officials in at least three Bay Area communities and many other
villages and cities around the nation have forced the paperback
edition of the controversial novel off the bookstands because they
or various elements in their area regard the book as “obscene.”
The latest move came Saturday when Police Chief Melvin Flohr
in Santa Rosa asked those selling the paperback edition to remove
it from their bookstands while he decides whether it is fit for the
public to read. The merchants complied, unfortunately.
Flohr, it seems to us from what we’ve read, is fairly typical of
the officials—usually law authorities—who take it upon themselves
to rule on the right of the 1 public to read certain literature.
He admitted to newsmen that he hadn't even heard of the novel
until two days before he took his action. We won’t comment on
this statement; we feel it speaks for itself.
Flohr also said he hadn’t read the book, though he plans to. He
said he had glanced through it enough, however, to decide it should
be removed from the stores so the public can’t purchase it while he
makes up his scholarly, qualified mind. Apparently he feels he can
judge the degree of “obscenity” of a book by flipping through a
few pages.
Anyone who has read the book—which would seem to be the
first requirement for forming an opinion of it—could tell the chief
that four-letter words don’t by themselves determine the worth of
a book.
We regard this local campaign against Miller’s book as another
in a growing number of cases where law authorities are subverting
civil liberties by making decisions they have no right to make. By
banning the book and depriving the public from reading it and
making up its own mind, such authorities are doing more harm than
could ever result from its unhindered sale.
We anxiously await a test case in a high court which will almost
certainly slap down the self-appointed censors and uphold a basic
American civil liberty.
