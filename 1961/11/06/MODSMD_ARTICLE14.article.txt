# STAFF OPINION
## SLATE Slaughtered By Cal Administration 
### ILENE STRELITZ 
Perhaps our flags should be fly
ing at half mast, for there has
been a shocking death, or slaugh
ter, in our vicinity.
The militant political spirit of
free interchange and openly stated
opinions that once characterized
the students at the Berkeley cam
pus of the University of California
has been killed, smothered with a
gag disguised as the Stars and
Stripes.
Last June, the Class of ’6l gath
ered at Berkeley to hear a gradu
ation address from Gov. Edmond
Brown. Brown praised the free
speech, the political enthusiasm
and absence of repression on the
campus. And a major part of his
audience agreed with him, as Ber
keley was certainly a center of
hard-fisted political activity.
A CAMPUS STUDENT political
association. SLATE, was winning
nation wide recognition on two
fronts. One was the release of its
record “Sounds of Protest,” a
documentary on the so-called
“riots” he’d during the House
Committee on Un-American Activ
ities meeting in San Francisco.
The record brought excellent re
sponse due to advertising in such
political journals as The New Re
public, The Nation and The Pro
gressive.
Secondly, a Berkeley printed
magazine “The Liberal Democrat”
receiving a great deal of SLATE
impetus, carried articles of such
worth that the existence of
SLATE was known and followed
on a myriad of campuses and
communities.
SLATE sponsored speeches, lec
tures, petitions, in general—po
litical awareness and received a
high degree of student body and
faculty support.
SLATE was devoted not to par
tisan action or discussion, not to
one issue, not to one outlook. Its
only committment was political.
It sought to relate campus issues
in their principle to the political
philosophies of the nation. It
sought to make the student body
aware of the full significance of
campus and national events in the
political frame of reference of
University life. Its goals were pos
itive; its philosophy was one of
freedom of thought and expres
sion.
BUT ONE WEEK after Cal stu
dents took off for home, the day
that the seniors gathered for com
mencement exercises, SLATE was
thrown off campus.
The action produced screaming
headlines in San Francisco papers,
but the only students the news
reached were those at Stanford,

which didn’t worry the authori
ties taking the actions at all. They
had taken care to act only at a
time when the issue would have
to age three months before it
could be handled. The technique
was so successfui.it seems a prod
uct of inspiration, perhaps the in
spiration of the Governor’s ad
dress on freedom of speech and
thought in our state universities.
As the students arrived back a
few weeks ago, they discovered
SLATE was operating off campus,
having been dismissed on a tech
nicality having no bearing on pol
icy, a technicality the administra
tion hadn’t discussed with aim of
solution with SLATE members.
SLATE had been referred to as a
political organization which seem
ed so dastardly a crime, it was re
moved. It seems, had this been the
only objection, someone would
have thought of suggesting to the
body it refer to itself differently

SLATE BEGAN sponsoring
speeches off campus; The Daily
Cal hasn’t gone a day without a
letter, an article, a report, or an
ttack on the ousted organization.
But the problem is on its way to
being solved. The John Birch typo
faction which is coming to show
its McCarthy-1 ik e techniques
throughout the nation has gather
ed together in a student organiza
tion aimed at replacing—and ex
posing SLATE and its ilk:
SAAT, the Student Association
Against Totalitarianism.
SAAT, unlike SLATE, has a
negative philosophy. It is against,
where SLATE is for. It is trying
to stamp out, where SLATE tries
to build up. It permits one set of
statements not only from its own
members, but everyone else as
well; SLATE aired the opinions of
all willing to express them.
SLATE was the University stu
dent trying to construct a finer
world; SAAT tries to destroy one.
And SLATE will be gradually
choked. A stigma of “pink,” “ul
tra-radical” and all the other pat
ent phrases will be applied to it
and rob it of much now blood it,
would normally attract. As an off
campus group it loses a good de
gree of contact with influence of
campus thought.

ONE OF the last bastions of
student action and awareness that
characterizes university life
throughout the rest of the world
succumbs to the flag-waving front
of a fearful state legislature and
a student body willing to be sway
ed like the nation that bent before
McCarthy.
SAAT acts in the name of patri
otism. Never has the flag been so
distasteful.
Perhaps our flags should be fly
ing at half mast, for there has
been a shocking death, or slaugh
ter, in our vicinity.

spiration of the Governor’s ad
dress on freedom of speech and
thought in our state universities.
As the students arrived back a
few weeks ago, they discovered
SLATE was operating off campus,
having been dismissed on a tech
nicality having no bearing on pol
icy, a technicality the administra
tion hadn’t discussed with aim of
solution with SLATE members.
SLATE had been referred to as a
political organization which seem
ed so dastardly a crime, it was re
moved. It seems, had this been the
only objection, someone would
have thought of suggesting to the
body it refer to itself differently

SLATE BEGAN sponsoring
speeches off campus; The Daily
Cal hasn’t gone a day without a
letter, an article, a report, or an
ttack on the ousted organization.
But the problem is on its way to
being solved. The John Birch typo
faction which is coming to show
its McCarthy-1 ik e techniques
throughout the nation has gather
ed together in a student organiza
tion aimed at replacing—and ex
posing SLATE and its ilk:
SAAT, the Student Association
Against Totalitarianism.
SAAT, unlike SLATE, has a
negative philosophy. It is against,
where SLATE is for. It is trying
to stamp out, where SLATE tries
to build up. It permits one set of
statements not only from its own
members, but everyone else as
well; SLATE aired the opinions of
all willing to express them.
SLATE was the University stu
dent trying to construct a finer
world; SAAT tries to destroy one.
And SLATE will be gradually
choked. A stigma of “pink,” “ul
tra-radical” and all the other pat
ent phrases will be applied to it
and rob it of much now blood it,
would normally attract. As an off
campus group it loses a good de
gree of contact with influence of
campus thought.

ONE OF the last bastions of
student action and awareness that
characterizes university life
throughout the rest of the world
succumbs to the flag-waving front
of a fearful state legislature and
a student body willing to be sway
ed like the nation that bent before
McCarthy.
SAAT acts in the name of patri
otism. Never has the flag been so
distasteful.
Perhaps our flags should be fly
ing at half mast, for there has
been a shocking death, or slaugh
ter, in our vicinity.
The militant political spirit of
free interchange and openly stated
opinions that once characterized
the students at the Berkeley cam
pus of the University of California
has been killed, smothered with a
gag disguised as the Stars and
Stripes.
Last June, the Class of ’6l gath
ered at Berkeley to hear a gradu
ation address from Gov. Edmond
Brown. Brown praised the free
speech, the political enthusiasm
and absence of repression on the
campus. And a major part of his
audience agreed with him, as Ber
keley was certainly a center of
hard-fisted political activity.
A CAMPUS STUDENT political
association. SLATE, was winning
nation wide recognition on two
fronts. One was the release of its
record “Sounds of Protest,” a
documentary on the so-called
“riots” he’d during the House
Committee on Un-American Activ
ities meeting in San Francisco.
The record brought excellent re
sponse due to advertising in such
political journals as The New Re
public, The Nation and The Pro
gressive.
Secondly, a Berkeley printed
magazine “The Liberal Democrat”
receiving a great deal of SLATE
impetus, carried articles of such
worth that the existence of
SLATE was known and followed
on a myriad of campuses and
communities.
SLATE sponsored speeches, lec
tures, petitions, in general—po
litical awareness and received a
high degree of student body and
faculty support.
SLATE was devoted not to par
tisan action or discussion, not to
one issue, not to one outlook. Its
only committment was political.
It sought to relate campus issues
in their principle to the political
philosophies of the nation. It
sought to make the student body
aware of the full significance of
campus and national events in the
political frame of reference of
University life. Its goals were pos
itive; its philosophy was one of
freedom of thought and expres
sion.
BUT ONE WEEK after Cal stu
dents took off for home, the day
that the seniors gathered for com
mencement exercises, SLATE was
thrown off campus.
The action produced screaming
headlines in San Francisco papers,
but the only students the news
reached were those at Stanford,

which didn’t worry the authori
ties taking the actions at all. They
had taken care to act only at a
time when the issue would have
to age three months before it
could be handled. The technique
was so successfui.it seems a prod

Last June, the Class of ’6l gath
ered at Berkeley to hear a gradu
ation address from Gov. Edmond
Brown. Brown praised the free
speech, the political enthusiasm
and absence of repression on the
campus. And a major part of his
audience agreed with him, as Ber
keley was certainly a center of
hard-fisted political activity.
A CAMPUS STUDENT political
association. SLATE, was winning
nation wide recognition on two
fronts. One was the release of its
record “Sounds of Protest,” a
documentary on the so-called
“riots” he’d during the House
Committee on Un-American Activ
ities meeting in San Francisco.
The record brought excellent re
sponse due to advertising in such
political journals as The New Re
public, The Nation and The Pro
gressive.
Secondly, a Berkeley printed
magazine “The Liberal Democrat”
receiving a great deal of SLATE
impetus, carried articles of such
worth that the existence of
SLATE was known and followed
on a myriad of campuses and
communities.
SLATE sponsored speeches, lec
tures, petitions, in general—po
litical awareness and received a
high degree of student body and
faculty support.
SLATE was devoted not to par
tisan action or discussion, not to
one issue, not to one outlook. Its
only committment was political.
It sought to relate campus issues
in their principle to the political
philosophies of the nation. It
sought to make the student body
aware of the full significance of
campus and national events in the
political frame of reference of
University life. Its goals were pos
itive; its philosophy was one of
freedom of thought and expres
sion.
BUT ONE WEEK after Cal stu
dents took off for home, the day
that the seniors gathered for com
mencement exercises, SLATE was
thrown off campus.
The action produced screaming
headlines in San Francisco papers,
but the only students the news
reached were those at Stanford,

which didn’t worry the authori
ties taking the actions at all. They
had taken care to act only at a
time when the issue would have
to age three months before it
could be handled. The technique
was so successfui.it seems a prod
uct of inspiration, perhaps the in
spiration of the Governor’s ad
dress on freedom of speech and
thought in our state universities.
As the students arrived back a
few weeks ago, they discovered
SLATE was operating off campus,
having been dismissed on a tech
nicality having no bearing on pol
icy, a technicality the administra
tion hadn’t discussed with aim of
solution with SLATE members.
SLATE had been referred to as a
political organization which seem
ed so dastardly a crime, it was re
moved. It seems, had this been the
only objection, someone would
have thought of suggesting to the
body it refer to itself differently

SLATE BEGAN sponsoring
speeches off campus; The Daily
Cal hasn’t gone a day without a
letter, an article, a report, or an
ttack on the ousted organization.
But the problem is on its way to
being solved. The John Birch typo
faction which is coming to show
its McCarthy-1 ik e techniques
throughout the nation has gather
ed together in a student organiza
tion aimed at replacing—and ex
posing SLATE and its ilk:
SAAT, the Student Association
Against Totalitarianism.
SAAT, unlike SLATE, has a
negative philosophy. It is against,
where SLATE is for. It is trying
to stamp out, where SLATE tries
to build up. It permits one set of
statements not only from its own
members, but everyone else as
well; SLATE aired the opinions of
all willing to express them.
SLATE was the University stu
dent trying to construct a finer
world; SAAT tries to destroy one.
And SLATE will be gradually
choked. A stigma of “pink,” “ul
tra-radical” and all the other pat
ent phrases will be applied to it
and rob it of much now blood it,
would normally attract. As an off
campus group it loses a good de
gree of contact with influence of
campus thought.

ONE OF the last bastions of
student action and awareness that
characterizes university life
throughout the rest of the world
succumbs to the flag-waving front
of a fearful state legislature and
a student body willing to be sway
ed like the nation that bent before
McCarthy.
SAAT acts in the name of patri
otism. Never has the flag been so
distasteful.
Perhaps our flags should be fly
ing at half mast, for there has
been a shocking death, or slaugh
ter, in our vicinity.
The militant political spirit of
free interchange and openly stated
opinions that once characterized
the students at the Berkeley cam
pus of the University of California
has been killed, smothered with a
gag disguised as the Stars and
Stripes.
