## Rooter Antics At Ore. Game 'Discredit' SU 
### NICK WESSELL 
Many in the crowd of 30,000 at
Saturday’s football game must
have left the stadium with a feel
ing of disgust for Stanford and
its students.
The obscene antics of the un
dergraduate rooting section re
flect nothing but discredit on peo
ple associated with the Universi
ty in any way.
Many alumni, guests, parents
and friends of Stanford must
have asked themselves why a
group of allegedly mature stu
dents would indicate in public,
both verbally and manually, that
someone should get inseminated.
MANY MUST have wondered
why we are incapable of restraint
and why we don’t give a damn
for the feelings of more mature
people who came to see a football
game and who had to see college
men acting like kids in junior
high.
Any Stanford man with friends
or family at the game must have
felt embarrassed and ashamed.
How can he apologize to anyone
for something which is so preva
lent in the student body and
which is condemned by no one in
the University?
He may easily wonder whether
Stanford students act the same
way in front of national television
or whether they reserve their ob
scenity for those Saturdays when
only 30,000 people will see them.
MANY PEOPLE will recognize
that it is not farfetched to com
pare Saturday's episode with the
recent attack on Quad during the
full moon.
Both incidents spring from the
same source: the popular attitude
that we can insult or misuse any
one in order to have our fun. The
fact that Saturday’s obscenity
was non-violent does little to ab
solve it of censure.
Obviously, the members of the
rooting section will not discipline
themselves. If they wanted to,
they could have Saturday. The re
sponsibility then rests with the
head yell leader, Tim Laddish.
UNFORTUNATELY, his re
marks encourage obscenity, and
his actions condone it.
If he lacks the inclination and
the guts to discourage these dis
plays, the dean of students should
act. He should act before the
whole student body is identified
with the actions of 100 uninhibit
ed students.
