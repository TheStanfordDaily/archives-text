HERMANN COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
In Friday’s Daily, Mr. Hermann
ci’iticizes the library lawn demon
stration at some length and sug
gests that the demonstration is a
result of:
A. A loss of faith in the possi
bility of modifying human nature
and.
B. Lack of faith in a “supremo
being.”
Therefore, he suggests, such
demonstrations are pessimistic
utterances of “magical sounds.”
Responsible students will seek
more constructive (less magical)

and optimistic approaches to I
world problems, he alleges.
I see nothing unmagical or op
timistic in a belief about Mr. Her
mann’s vague kind of "supreme
being.”
Of course, if Mr. Hermann were
willing to go the whole way and
posit a God who redeems his cre
ation through his acts in history
and human affairs, then perhaps
one might grant him a measure
of optimism. But then, we might
have to admit that the library
lawn vigil was more than a magi
cal ritual, wouldn’t we?

Tom Conner
Editor, Tlie Daily;
This is in response to Ross Her
mann’s article criticizing (the)
protest of nuclear testing.
Whether Hermann likes women
with "long stringy hair” or crew
cuts has no place in a discussion
of atomic testing. His comments
on the attire of the demonstra
tors and the parallel to a “primi
tive ritual” were uncalled for.
He seems to feel that this type
of protest is indicative of a sense
of futility. Failure to register an
opinion one way or the other
would appear to be a greater in
dication of a sense of futility.
The action of sitting on the li
brary lawn may in itself be fu
tile; but at least it is action.
Rather than being a sign of shat
tered faith in mankind, as Her
mann believes, this protest seems
to indicate that there are people
who feel that man can still change
his destiny and voluntarily con
trol the forces his science has re
leased.
Hermann exhorts us to seek
more "constructive, optimistic ap
proaches to the world’s prob
lems.” Urging President Kennedy
to resume atmospheric testing is
one of his suggestions. As an end
in itself, this is neither construc
tive nor optimistic.
The group in front of the li
brary may be criticized more val
idly for its hesitancy to make a
deal 1 statement. Later in the eve
ning they were more interested
in talking among themselves than
in making converts. Perhaps a
mimeographed statement outlin
ing the group's position should
have been available to passers-by.
Rather than simply characteriz
ing a protest like this as an ex
ample of a type of supposedly fu
tile thinking and slovenly dress
ing which he abhors, Mr. Her
mann would do better to seek to
learn their arguments and ana
lyze those arguments on political
and moral grounds, forming his
criticism upon that basis.

Is it true that Ross Hermann is
the first mutation produced by
the 50-megaton bomb?
Gary Green
Editor, The Daily;
Amid the nightly campouts on
the library lawn, housewifely pe
titions, cries of “massive preven
tive war,” internal subversion,
pinkos, REDS, quitting generals,
and the recitals of various sorts
of glorious futures under social
ism, communism, capitalism or
fallout shelters, it is truly thrill
ing to read words of hope by Mr.
Hermann . . .
By God, let’s go ahead and drop
some fallout on anyone who is

bad. That is positive thinking and
reflects great faith in man and
belief in a supreme being.
All the significant political-re
ligious thought of the past pale
in the brilliance of this “construc
tive and optimistic approach to
world problems.”
Surely this OPERATION
FALLOUT, given certain condi
tions, could cause the cells of the
minds of all evil men to change
so that they will face the serious
realities of the 20th century.
My mind and soul have never
been so inspired! Thank you, Mr.
Hermann.
