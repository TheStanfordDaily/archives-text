# Europe Starts Thinking About Civil Defense
## 
### 
LONDON (UPI) Western
Europe is becoming less amused
than it was some weeks ago by
American “nuclear shelter fever”
and is beginning to do some civil
defense worrying of its own.
There is still very little being
done to provide shelters in most
European countries, and civil de
fense programs either are non
existent, disorganized or simply
in the plotting stage.
But Russia’s nuclear testing and
especially its explosion of its 30-
megaton and 50-plus megaton
bombs, has had an impact on both
public and government thinking
in Europe.
FOR ONE THING, each coun
try is keeping a careful check on
the amounts of radio-active fall
out from the Soviet tests, and
several have arrangements for
sounding public warnings in the
event of dangerous fallout levels.
Here is a summary of the situa
tion in European countries:
BRITAIN: Rear of fallout ef
fects on food, especially milk,
reached almost scare level after
Russia exploded its “big one” last
Monday.
More and more voices are being
raised to ask: What is the gov
ernment doing to provide shelters
against the possibility of nuclear
war? No formal program yet ex
ists.
FRANCE; Radiation testing is
less organized than in most Eu
ropean countries taut is being car
ried out by several laboratories.
The civil defense establishment
Protection Civile or “PC”—has
a network of fallout warning de
vices, more than 1.000 throughout
France.
There have been no drills. There
is no shelter program, nor any
public demand for one.
ITALY: No protective measures
against fallout have been taken
or even talked about. There are
no known fallout shelters, public
or private, in the country, nor any
public demand for them.
WEST GERMANY: No protec
tive measures against dangerous
fallout have been taken. There
are no special shelters nor plans
to provide them.
SWEDEN: All the Scandinavian
countries are actively engaged in
protective measures.
Sweden has constructed what
may be the most elaborate public
air raid shelters in the world, in
cluding four enormous under
ground chambers hewn out of
rock under parts of Stockholm.
All cities have extensive evacu
ation plans.
