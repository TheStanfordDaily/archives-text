HERMANN COLUMN
Editor, Tlie Daily:
Being one of those who partici
pated in the protest of nuclear
testing, I was especially interest
ed to road Ross Hermann’s article
. . . in The Daily . . .
The protest was one in which
individuals participated. As one
individual, I wish to make clear
my personal motives in partici
pating, and my feelings concern
ing the effectiveness of the pro
test.
I feel that as individuals the
people of the world are responsi
ble for the future of humanity.
International relations are, basic
ally, interpersonal relationships,
for nations are composed of in
dividuals. National and interna
tional policies arc thus my per
sonal concern. This conviction
caused me to participate in the
protest.
The protest and the petition
were futile, at least in the literal
sense. As it is the unity of single
votes which causes the outcome
of elections, however, so the con
cern of enough individuals may
finally turn the tide of political
events . . .

Near the conclusion of the ar
ticle, Mr. Her mann stated that he
felt that President Kennedy
should resume nuclear testing, in
an effort to frighten Khrushchev
into ordering the cessation of
Russian testing.
The author stated that he felt
this would be a “more construc
tive course of action.” What is
“constructive” about causing fall
out to spread over the populous
areas of the Soviet Union, thus
injuring innocent individuals?

This seems neither moral nor
practical. Ethically, such action is
the complete-opposite of the con
cern for the individual which, it
is so often declared, is basic to our
democratic society. Put into prac
tice, such action would:
A. I Be provocative.

B. » Be a cause for the Russian
government to take similar action
across the Bering Strait.
C. ) Brand our government as
merely more self-righteous, not
more humane, than the Russian
government.
The action advocated by Mr.
Hermann is ... of a type com
pletely contrary to the concern
for all humanity implicit in the
Stanford protest.

NEUTRON BOMB
Editor, The Daily:
To the cry of protest which the
Soviet Union’s recent nuclear'
tests have aroused around the
world, Sen. Dodd has added a note
of discoid, when he urged the
U.S. to resume atmospheric tests
in order to perfect the neutron

bomb, which has the virtue of
destroying animal and human
life without damage to property.
Such a plea seems to overlook
the fact that germ warfare can
achieve the same result quite ade
quately. But perhaps the senator
wishes to reserve bacteria as a
finishing-off device for any
chance survivors.

The pressure to create a neu
tron bomb reveals clearly where
one's real concern lies—that is,
with the preservation of property,
even property which is not pri
vate but that, of course, we
could easily remedy when the de
bris had been cleared away.
We have indeed progressed
since the days of Socrates —who
considered it his “first principle”
that “neither ‘injury, nor retali
ation, nor warding off evil by evil
is ever right.” One might gather,
however, that our first principles
have shifted slightly in meaning,
so that the preservation of prop
erty takes precedent as a good
over the preservation of human
life; or, in other words, that mur
der is not an evil when the su
preme good is conserved —prop-
erty.

The U.S. has been actively de
nouncing the Russian tests as in
creasing the level of radioactivity
in the atmosphere. To contribute
still more ourselves would indi
cate that our protest is mere lip
service to a concern for humanity:
the hypocritical posture of one
who wishes to usurp moral super
iority without the necessity to
act morally.
When dealing with a danger in
volving pure quantity, it seems
irrational to attempt to evade
moral condemnation by saying
that one responded rather than
initiated. In this situation, one is,
in fact, all the more “responsible.”

RED C HINA
Editor, The Daily:
It is always interesting to note
how the selection of material by
a newsman choosing some
angles and leaving out others
would affect the presentation of
news. The Daily story on Nov. 3
on conditions in Red China is an
example.
For instance, the Daily story
did not mention that the speaker,
Dr. Chandra-sekhar of India, also
said, among other things:
l.t Life in Red China looks like
life in a zoo. People work, and get
fed, clothed and housed. But he
did not see “a single face of
smile.” In India, where some vil
lagers may* be worrying about
their next meals, you can see
smiles.

2.) He compared Red China to
a big mass prison, very clean.
The death rate has dropped. But

he said in India they have always
found the rate of death lower
among the prisoners than among
the population because the pris
oners must keep clean.
3.) Although Dr. Chandra-sek
har said we do not further the
world’s interest by isolating and
boycotting Red China, he said he
did not think Red China should
be admitted to the U.N. He men
tioned three reasons:
First, admittance of Red China
into the U.N. would only increase
the prestige of Peiping.
Second, such an event might
lead to seizure of the whole South
east Asia by Red China. Some of
the 15,000,000 Chinese residents
in that region, who now look to
ward Taipei, would then look to
ward Peiping and might be turn
ed into a fifth column by Red
China.

Third, to say that U.N. mem
bership would provide Red China
with a “forum” is “nonsense” be
cause a forum already exists in
Geneva and in Warsaw, where
representatives of Red China and
the United States have been talk
ing for years without any results.
As Dr. Chandra sekhar spoke
rather rapidly and as I didn’t take
notes, I wish the Daily reporter
would correct me if I got errone
ous impressions.

MUSIC CRITICISM
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Charles Schlacks’ article in
The Daily about the chamber mu
sic concert at Dinkelspiel on the
afternoon of Oct. 29 has “prompt
ed me to gather together a few
impressions” of my own.
First, I gather that Mr.
Schlacks did not enjoy Haydn’s
Symphony No. 93 as performed
by the Stanford Chamber Orches
tra. He thought the tempo was
too fast. That’s his privilege; dis
tinguished people often disagree
about such matters.

I also gather that Mr. Schlacks
believes he has a highly developed
feeling for the culture of Europe
in the 18th century, the political,
social and intellectual climate in
which Haydn composed the work

in question. If this be the case,
more power to Mr. Schlacks.
I also gather that Mr. Schlacks
subscribes to the notion that mu
sic can and should communicate
something of the historical en
vironment in which it was cre
ated. This may be a defensible
position, but Mr. Schlacks’ pomp
ous offering would seem to indi
cate that this theory has univers
al acceptance.
Actually there is considerable
argument about what music is
equipped to communicate and
about what the relation of the
performer to the composer should
be.

Personally, the last thing I'm
interested in when 1 listen to mu
sic is the environment in which
it was created. Even if 1 were to
agree witli Mr. Schlacks’ aesthetic
position, I would defy him to
prove that Haydn and the 18th
century would have objected to
Sandor Salgo’s interpretation of
the Haydn symphony.
Perhaps each measure isn’t as
heavily laden with musical mean
ing as Mr. Schlacks thinks. It’s a

simple matter of opinion, hardly
worthy of a pretentious letter.
Donald Anthony
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the chamber
orchestra, I feel called upon to
express my appreciation of Mr.
Schlacks’ remarks . . .
It seems there are two disjoint
standpoints from which to evalu
ate those remarks. Either Mr.
Schlacks is a musician who has
played in orchestras, or he isn’t.
In the former case, it must be
that he was so attuned while play
ing, to the full range of each bar,
and the political, social and intel
lectual implications ringing bold
ly forth, that he did not notice
that the majority of his col
leagues were struggling with the
notes, with intonation, following
rough dynamic instructions from
rehearsal.
But how could he fail to notice
that, in the orchestra, one can
hear only the loudest and closest
instruments, that one must trust
to the conductor’s signs for so
simple a thing as balance?
If Mr. Schlacks is not a musici
an, then his remarks seem to me
a brilliant product of the intense,
driving intellectual atmosphere of
a Western Civ section, and I trust

he convoyed them to his students.
1 eagerly await another article
from Mr. Schlacks, drawing an
alogies to America’s stepped-up
tempi from the pedestrian vs.
cyclist problem.
