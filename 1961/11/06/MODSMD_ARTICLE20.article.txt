# OREGON SPEEDSTER SCORES TWICE
## Renfro Ruins Stanford Bid, 19-7 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford had the breaks and
a statistical advantage, taut Ore
gon had Mel Renfro.
The big sophomore from Port
land, was only in the game Gta
minutes but passed for one touch
down and ran for the other two
Oregon tallies in their 19-7 win
over Stanford Saturday.
RENFRO participated in only
one play in the first quarter but
that play was a four-yard burst
off tackle behind the blocking of
All-Coast tackle Steve Barnett for
the first Oregon touchdown.
In the second quarter he gained
17 yards on a screen pass from
Ron Veres to move the ball to the
Stanford 34, and one play later,
with no time showing on the
scoreboard clock, passed 30 yards
to Paul Burleson for another
touchdown. Renfro had taken a
handoff, faked a reverse, and
spiraled a perfect pass to Burle
son, who had gotten behind de
fenders Tim Hansel and Gary
Craig in the end zone. Renfro’s
scoring aerial was the first touch
down pass thrown against Stan
ford this year.
Downfield blocking gave him
a huge hole and ho turned on the
speed to go in standing up.
STANFORD had every kind of
conceivable break but just
couldn’t get into the end zone un
til 6:35 were left in the third quar
ter, when Jay Ward climaxed a
40-yard march in eight plays by
plunging over from the one.
Stanford was aided by penalties

against Oregon that included four
straight violations toward the end
of tire first half. One of the pen
alties nullified a 64-yard reverse
and end sweep by Mike Gaechter.
Another penalty gave Stanford
the ball on the Oregon one.
The call was pass interference
by Gaechter on Frank Patitucci
in the end zone and it set up the
Stanford touchdown.

STANFORD was also helped
by poor Oregon punting that
averaged 22.5 yards on six kicks.
A pass interception and two re
covered fumbles all went for
naught, as Stanford reached the
Oregon 12, 5, 15 and 20 but
couldn’t score.

Four pass interceptions and a
lost fumble plagued the Tribe.
Jim Smith was nicked three times
and Rod Sears was victimized
once. Stanford also lost its only
fumble.
THE FUMBLE came on Stan
ford's first series of downs. Dan
ny Spence hobbled and Oregon
immediately recovered and
marched 49 yards for the first
touchdown.
Stanford threatened first early
in the second quarter when Ron
Snidow punted for just 22 yards.
Smith, working at quarterback
for the first time this year, went
to the air. He completed three

passes for 33 yards down to the
Oregon 32, but Oregon linebacker
Jim Josephson intercepted his
next toss on the 32.

Stanford came right back when
Gary Craig intercepted a Ron
Veres pass and ran it back 33
yards, aided by Patitucci’s block
ing. Stanford got to the Oregon
27, but Sears’ pass was intercept
ed in the end zone.

VEBKS returned the compli
ment and fumbled to Stanford on
the 20 on the first play. Stanford
got to a fourth and five yards to
go on the fifteen, but Sears got
only three on a rollout and Ore
gon had held again.
The Indians got the ball once
more in the first half and Smith’s
pass was intercepted by Lu Bain,
setting up the Renfro-Burleson
pass.
Stanford dominated the second
half, running 47 plays to Ore
gon’s 17, but could only score
once.

THE CARD’S touchdown was
set up by a 34-yard punt by Sni
dow from his end zone. Craig
gained two off tackle and Butler
tossed to Patitucci for 18 yards
and a first down on the Oregon
20. Craig reeled off an 11-yard
advance and the Indians were in
business.

A holding penalty momentarily
halted the drive, but the pass in

terference set up Ward’s one-yard
leap for the score. Lindskog boot
ed the point, putting the Indians
within one touchdown of the lead.
Unfortunately it was Oregon who
got the touchdown 11 seconds
later on Renfro’s 94-yard gallop.
Stanford fought back, but Ore
gon rose to meet every challenge.
Late in the third quarter Stan
ford drove to the Oregon nine, but
Butler was held to a four-yard
advance on a fourth down and
four situation.
STANFORD advanced to the 28
and 26 in the fourth quarter, but
an interception by Bain and a
leaping tackle by Snidow destroy
ed any Stanford hopes still left.
For Stanford. Patitucci played
a standout game. He blocked a
punt, caught a 19-yard pass and
turned in the Oregon end sweeps.
Ed Cummings and John Butler
did their usual outstanding de
fensive linebacking.
Offensively, Stan Lindskog and
Jay Ward were the work horses,
carrying the ball 28 times be
tween them.

KEY TRIBE RUSHING GAIN -Stanford halfback Gary Craig skirts around left end for 12 yards and an
Indian first down. This play set up the sole Card score late in the third quarter. Tribe blockers are
center John Butler (69) and halfback Tim Hansel (27). In the foreground is Oregon halfback Ben
Brown. Craig carried the ball five times in the third quarter for a net gain of 21 yards.
Stanford had the breaks and
a statistical advantage, taut Ore
gon had Mel Renfro.
The big sophomore from Port
land, was only in the game Gta
minutes but passed for one touch
down and ran for the other two
Oregon tallies in their 19-7 win
over Stanford Saturday.
RENFRO participated in only
one play in the first quarter but
that play was a four-yard burst
off tackle behind the blocking of
All-Coast tackle Steve Barnett for
the first Oregon touchdown.
In the second quarter he gained
17 yards on a screen pass from
Ron Veres to move the ball to the
Stanford 34, and one play later,
with no time showing on the
scoreboard clock, passed 30 yards
to Paul Burleson for another
touchdown. Renfro had taken a
handoff, faked a reverse, and
spiraled a perfect pass to Burle
son, who had gotten behind de
fenders Tim Hansel and Gary
Craig in the end zone. Renfro’s
scoring aerial was the first touch
down pass thrown against Stan
ford this year.
Downfield blocking gave him
a huge hole and ho turned on the
speed to go in standing up.
STANFORD had every kind of
conceivable break but just
couldn’t get into the end zone un
til 6:35 were left in the third quar
ter, when Jay Ward climaxed a
40-yard march in eight plays by
plunging over from the one.
Stanford was aided by penalties

against Oregon that included four
straight violations toward the end
of tire first half. One of the pen
alties nullified a 64-yard reverse
and end sweep by Mike Gaechter.
Another penalty gave Stanford
the ball on the Oregon one.
The call was pass interference
by Gaechter on Frank Patitucci
in the end zone and it set up the
Stanford touchdown.

STANFORD was also helped
by poor Oregon punting that
averaged 22.5 yards on six kicks.
A pass interception and two re
covered fumbles all went for
naught, as Stanford reached the
Oregon 12, 5, 15 and 20 but
couldn’t score.

Four pass interceptions and a
lost fumble plagued the Tribe.
Jim Smith was nicked three times
and Rod Sears was victimized
once. Stanford also lost its only
fumble.
THE FUMBLE came on Stan
ford's first series of downs. Dan
ny Spence hobbled and Oregon
immediately recovered and
marched 49 yards for the first
touchdown.
Stanford threatened first early
in the second quarter when Ron
Snidow punted for just 22 yards.
Smith, working at quarterback
for the first time this year, went
to the air. He completed three

passes for 33 yards down to the
Oregon 32, but Oregon linebacker
Jim Josephson intercepted his
next toss on the 32.

Stanford came right back when
Gary Craig intercepted a Ron
Veres pass and ran it back 33
yards, aided by Patitucci’s block
ing. Stanford got to the Oregon
27, but Sears’ pass was intercept
ed in the end zone.

VEBKS returned the compli

the 20 on the first play. Stanford
got to a fourth and five yards to
go on the fifteen, but Sears got
only three on a rollout and Ore
gon had held again.
The Indians got the ball once
more in the first half and Smith’s
pass was intercepted by Lu Bain,
setting up the Renfro-Burleson
pass.
Stanford dominated the second
half, running 47 plays to Ore

once.

THE CARD’S touchdown was
set up by a 34-yard punt by Sni

Smith, working at quarterback
for the first time this year, went
to the air. He completed three

passes for 33 yards down to the
Oregon 32, but Oregon linebacker
Jim Josephson intercepted his
next toss on the 32.

Stanford came right back when
Gary Craig intercepted a Ron
Veres pass and ran it back 33
yards, aided by Patitucci’s block
ing. Stanford got to the Oregon
27, but Sears’ pass was intercept
ed in the end zone.

VEBKS returned the compli
ment and fumbled to Stanford on
the 20 on the first play. Stanford
got to a fourth and five yards to
go on the fifteen, but Sears got
only three on a rollout and Ore
gon had held again.
The Indians got the ball once
more in the first half and Smith’s
pass was intercepted by Lu Bain,
setting up the Renfro-Burleson
pass.
Stanford dominated the second
half, running 47 plays to Ore
gon’s 17, but could only score
once.

THE CARD’S touchdown was
set up by a 34-yard punt by Sni
dow from his end zone. Craig
gained two off tackle and Butler
tossed to Patitucci for 18 yards
and a first down on the Oregon
20. Craig reeled off an 11-yard
advance and the Indians were in
business.

A holding penalty momentarily
halted the drive, but the pass in

terference set up Ward’s one-yard
leap for the score. Lindskog boot
ed the point, putting the Indians
within one touchdown of the lead.
Unfortunately it was Oregon who
got the touchdown 11 seconds
later on Renfro’s 94-yard gallop.
Stanford fought back, but Ore

For Stanford. Patitucci played
a standout game. He blocked a
punt, caught a 19-yard pass and
turned in the Oregon end sweeps.
Ed Cummings and John Butler
did their usual outstanding de
fensive linebacking.
Offensively, Stan Lindskog and

KEY TRIBE RUSHING GAIN -Stanford halfback Gary Craig skirts around left end for 12 yards and an
Indian first down. This play set up the sole Card score late in the third quarter. Tribe blockers are
center John Butler (69) and halfback Tim Hansel (27). In the foreground is Oregon halfback Ben
Brown. Craig carried the ball five times in the third quarter for a net gain of 21 yards.
Stanford had the breaks and
a statistical advantage, taut Ore
gon had Mel Renfro.
The big sophomore from Port
land, was only in the game Gta
minutes but passed for one touch
down and ran for the other two
Oregon tallies in their 19-7 win
over Stanford Saturday.
RENFRO participated in only
one play in the first quarter but
that play was a four-yard burst
off tackle behind the blocking of
All-Coast tackle Steve Barnett for
the first Oregon touchdown.
In the second quarter he gained
17 yards on a screen pass from
Ron Veres to move the ball to the
Stanford 34, and one play later,
with no time showing on the
scoreboard clock, passed 30 yards
to Paul Burleson for another
touchdown. Renfro had taken a
handoff, faked a reverse, and
spiraled a perfect pass to Burle
son, who had gotten behind de
fenders Tim Hansel and Gary
Craig in the end zone. Renfro’s
scoring aerial was the first touch
down pass thrown against Stan
ford this year.
Downfield blocking gave him
a huge hole and ho turned on the
speed to go in standing up.
STANFORD had every kind of
conceivable break but just
couldn’t get into the end zone un
til 6:35 were left in the third quar
ter, when Jay Ward climaxed a
40-yard march in eight plays by
plunging over from the one.
Stanford was aided by penalties

against Oregon that included four
straight violations toward the end
of tire first half. One of the pen
alties nullified a 64-yard reverse
and end sweep by Mike Gaechter.
Another penalty gave Stanford
the ball on the Oregon one.
The call was pass interference
by Gaechter on Frank Patitucci
in the end zone and it set up the
Stanford touchdown.

STANFORD was also helped
by poor Oregon punting that
averaged 22.5 yards on six kicks.
A pass interception and two re
covered fumbles all went for
naught, as Stanford reached the
Oregon 12, 5, 15 and 20 but
couldn’t score.

Four pass interceptions and a
lost fumble plagued the Tribe.
Jim Smith was nicked three times
and Rod Sears was victimized
once. Stanford also lost its only
fumble.
THE FUMBLE came on Stan
ford's first series of downs. Dan
ny Spence hobbled and Oregon
immediately recovered and
marched 49 yards for the first
touchdown.
Stanford threatened first early
in the second quarter when Ron
Snidow punted for just 22 yards.
