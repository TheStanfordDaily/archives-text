# Renfro Lauded By Duck Coach
## 
### 
For the coach of a team that
had just won a game, Len Casa
nova was surprisingly unhappy
in his post-game interview in the
Oregon dressing room Saturday.
"We played sloppy ball,” the
Oregon coach complained. “We
made mistakes we haven’t made
in a long while. We played poor
defense, our guards were pulling
too soon and that two men in mo
tion business was ridiculous.”
But Casanova didn’t stay glum
very long.
"Thank God for Renfro,” he
said. "He’s everything we’ve been
telling you he is. This was his
first contact since he was hurt in
the second game of the year
against Utah. He had an opera
tion on a splintered bone in his
instep less than three w’eeks ago
and all he’s done since then is a
little running.
"That pass he threw (for a
touchdown) is an option for the
halfback. He played quarterback
and halfback in high school so
we know he could throw. It was
his first pass this year, though.”
"The sophomore phenom is also
a good blocker and tackier,” Casa
nova said.
Defensive halfback Mickey
Bruce suffered a dislocated
shoulder in the first half and is
probably gone for the year, the
Duck’s coach said.

“Stanford played pretty good
ball. Their attack was well con
ceived for us. Tho.se quarterbacks
ran more today than they ever did
in their lives, didn’t they?”
