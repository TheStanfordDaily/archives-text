# Curtice Claims Renfro 'Best Half We've Faced'
## 
### 
“That Renfro’s dynamite, he’s
the best halfback we’ve faced all
year.” Those were the jealous
words of Stanford Coach Jack
Curtice after his listless Indians
had just bowed to Oregon, 19-7.
‘‘Without him, we probably could
have won.”
The reference was to Mel Ren
fro, a sophomore who had missed
the last five games because of in
juries. The Oregon speedster ran
94 yards for one touchdown,
passed 39 yards for another, and
wriggled through the middle of
the Stanford line for a third.
His TD pass came with just
three seconds remaining in the
first half and was actually caught
after time had run out.
“That pass wasn’t anything to
speak of,” Curtice said. “They
didn’t pull anyone out of position,
our safety was right where he
should have been.” Halfbacks Tim
Hansel and Gary Craig, who were
covering on the play, said they
just misjudged the ball.
This was the first contact for

Renfro since he was hurt in the
first quarter against Utah on
Sept. 30. It was also the first time
he had tried the pass-run option
for the Ducks. He played quarter
back his senior year in high
school.
The Stanford head man claimed
that lack of speed kept his team
from going over on several long
drives. “We made enough yards
to score eight touchdowns, but I
guess that’s the difference. God
only makes you so fast, you
know.” Statistics bear him out.
The Indians outgained the Ducks
265 to 260 in total offense.
“We were asking a lot, sending
Jimmy Smith in there like that.
His timing was not too good,”
Curtice said.
Smith, who has been running at
halfback for most of the year,
was converted back to quarter
back for the Oregon game. He ran
well, but had three passes inter
cepted while completing four of
eight.
Curtice cited the play of Ore
gon’s Steve Barnett, a 6-1, 252-
pound tackJc who was named Big
Five lineman of the week for his
play against Washington last
week. Barnett led the Ducks in
tackles again with five.
Physically, the Indians came
out of the game in good shape.
Fullback Jay Ward strained a
knee and Gary Sargent sprained
an ankle, but neither injury is re
garded as serious. Steve Thurlow,
star quarterback for the Indians,
is expected to be released from
the hospital Wednesday, but Cur
tice doesn’t know how soon he
will be able to practice.

“That Renfro’s dynamite, he’s
the best halfback we’ve faced all
year.” Those were the jealous
words of Stanford Coach Jack
Curtice after his listless Indians
had just bowed to Oregon, 19-7.
‘‘Without him, we probably could
have won.”
The reference was to Mel Ren
fro, a sophomore who had missed
the last five games because of in
juries. The Oregon speedster ran
94 yards for one touchdown,
passed 39 yards for another, and
wriggled through the middle of
the Stanford line for a third.
His TD pass came with just
three seconds remaining in the
first half and was actually caught
after time had run out.
“That pass wasn’t anything to
speak of,” Curtice said. “They
didn’t pull anyone out of position,
our safety was right where he
should have been.” Halfbacks Tim
Hansel and Gary Craig, who were
covering on the play, said they
just misjudged the ball.
This was the first contact for

Renfro since he was hurt in the
first quarter against Utah on
Sept. 30. It was also the first time
he had tried the pass-run option
for the Ducks. He played quarter
back his senior year in high
school.
The Stanford head man claimed
that lack of speed kept his team
from going over on several long
drives. “We made enough yards
to score eight touchdowns, but I
guess that’s the difference. God
only makes you so fast, you
know.” Statistics bear him out.
The Indians outgained the Ducks
265 to 260 in total offense.
“We were asking a lot, sending
Jimmy Smith in there like that.
His timing was not too good,”
Curtice said.
Smith, who has been running at
halfback for most of the year,
was converted back to quarter
back for the Oregon game. He ran
well, but had three passes inter
cepted while completing four of
eight.
Curtice cited the play of Ore
gon’s Steve Barnett, a 6-1, 252-
pound tackJc who was named Big
Five lineman of the week for his
play against Washington last
week. Barnett led the Ducks in
tackles again with five.
Physically, the Indians came
out of the game in good shape.
Fullback Jay Ward strained a
knee and Gary Sargent sprained
an ankle, but neither injury is re
garded as serious. Steve Thurlow,
star quarterback for the Indians,
is expected to be released from
the hospital Wednesday, but Cur
tice doesn’t know how soon he
will be able to practice.
