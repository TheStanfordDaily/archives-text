## Stanford Speakers Win Six Firsts in Tourney 
### 
Stanford speakers distinguished themselves over the 1 weekend
hy winning six first places and a handful of other honors in the fall
Northern California Forensics Association tournament in San Fran
cisco. A pair of freshmen, Randy Willard and Bill Cornwall, led a
near-sweep for Stanford debaters in the junior division, as the Farm

carried off Ist, 2nd, and 4th
places, despite competition from
71 teams entered by 18 schools.
WILLARD and Cornwall won
all six of their contests, as did
Doug Thompson and Gerry
Glancy, who came in second. The
awards were decided on speaker
ratings, with the top duo having
71 points to 69 for Thompson and
Glancy. Fred Simpson and Dick
Grossman were fourth, with a 5-1
record. Roger Green excelled in
extemporaneous speaking, win
ning second place.
Out of 142 debaters entered in
the division, 10 were selected as
“most outstanding.” Five wore
Stanfordites: Willard, Cornwall,
Thompson, Simpson and Gross
man.
In senior division, the more ex
perienced Stanford speakers
stood out in individual events.
Keith Winsell and Tom Ommen
tied for first in extemporaneous
speaking, both being rated first
in each round. Eric Kennell, Bar
ry Carter and Barrie Thorne did
almost as well, tying for third.
IMPROMPTU speaking also
found Stanford on top, with Dan
Tarlock and Miss Thorne in a
deadlock for first, and Edic
Brown tied for fourth.
Five Indian debate teams tied
for fourth place in senior divi
sion, each winning four and losing
two. They were Ann Glashagei

Mike Owen, and Chuck Bischoff
and Larry Neal.
In commenting on the results,
Dr. Jon Ericson, director of the
forensic program, pointed out
that Stanford participation in
speech activities is at an all-time
high. Fifly-two students took
part in this tournament, and 28
of them, including all who won
awards in the lower division, had
never been to an intercollegiate
forensic meet before.
THU DEBATES were contested
on the topic: Resolved, that labor
unions should be under the juris
diction of anti-trust laws. All
teams were required to debate on
both sides of the question, alter
nating back and forth throughout
the two days.
Extemporaneous speakers drew
assorted topics on questions re
lated to civil rights, after which
they had 30 minutes to prepare
seven-minute talks. Impromptu
speakers received subjects deal
ing with international relations,
and were required to speak with
out any preparation whatsoever.
