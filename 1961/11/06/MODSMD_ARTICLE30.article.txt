# Frosh Bow to Strong Cubs
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
Cal’s freshman hacks delivered I
the long run when it was needed |
last Saturday, setting up the keyj,
touchdowns in the Baby Bears’
20-13 win over the Stanford frosh I
at Berkeley.
With Stanford leading 7-6 in j
the closing minutes of the first
quarter, Cal wingback Tyrone
Price shot 20 yards around left |
end on a flashy double reverse, i
He was tackled from behind by i
Alan Curr on the Cal 43-yard
line.
Two plays later, Greg Pala
mountain found a big hole over
left guard and turned on the
steam. He wont 48 yards to the
Stanford nine before Bob Rath
could bring him down. Cal scored
in two more attempts, but Rath
tackled Walt Raymond just short
of a two-point conversion to pre
serve the Stanford lead.
Cal quarterback Craig Morion I
set up the go-ahead score for the
Cubs as he rolled out and around
for 52 yards to the St anfo r d !
eight-yard line. He fumbled in the |
Papoose end zone with 10:56 re
maining in the half. Dennis Pea- j
cocke recovering for Cal and the
touchdown. Morton passed to Joe j
j Rapisarda for two extra points,!
putting Stanford down by seven
at halftime.
The Cal eleven was back again I
| in the early minutes of the third *

period. Morion saw Tom Blanch
field in ihe open on I he Stanford
35 and hit him with a 17-yard
aerial. Blanchfield developed the
play into a 52-yard scoring effort
with a fine run to the end zone.
He was hit hard on the five, but
managed to dive in for the score.
Alan Curr scored for Stanford
exactly 13 seconds later, with
13:40 remaining in the third quar
tor. Taking the Cal kickoff on his
own seven, ran up the middle to i
the St an f or d 30, veered left
around a mass of blockers and
tacklers, and shot down the side
lines. outrunning two Cal safety
men in the process.
The game was a series of frus
trations for the Papooses. They
had one touchdown called back
in the first quarter due to a hold
ing penalty, and were inside the
Cal 20-yard line twice in the
fourth quarter while still unable
to score.
Some fine running by Bucky
Rosen was wasted when his first
period touchdown was nullified.
His six-yard run climaxed a nine
play, 49-yard drive staged by the
Papooses on their first offensive
effort. Rosen carried five times
during the thrust, gaining 28
j yards.
Cal pushed the Papooses back
to the 24, where they took over
on downs, to be stopped by an
aggressive Stanford defense on

their own 41. Rosen returned a!
punt 32 yards to set up the first j
Papoose touchdown to gel on the
scoreboard. Quarterback Dick
Ragsdale passed to J. D. Lodato
for 17 yards and to Phil Hum-;
phreys for 23 yards before sneak |
ing the hall over from the one I
yard line on fourth down.
Ragsdale had only one of his I
23 aerial attempts intercepted,
but that one put an end to Stan
ford’s hope in the final period.
Ragsdale had just previously
passed to Lodato for gains of 21,
24 and seven yards and ran eight
yards himself to give the Pa
pooses a first down on Ihe Cal 19.
Joe Rapasarda picked off Rags
dale's next effort at the seven,
though, and the Cubs were able
to eat the clock up for the win.
Palamounlain gets credit for
the longest run from scrimmage
in any of this year’s frosh games.
Taking a handoff on his own 10-
yard line, he sprinted 70 yards to
the Stanford 14 before Lodato
could catch him and bring him
down.
Palamountain’s run culminated
another Stanford disappointment.
The frosh had blasted their way
| from the Stanford 20 down to the
Cal 11-yard line in 11 plays. There
the drive inexplicably sputtered
and died, a fourth down pass fall
j ing incomplete.
I Morton, described by Papoose

| coach Dan Stavely before the
j game as "fabulous,” was the most
| effective offensive player-on the
field, for the Cal frosh and the
I Stanford frosh. He passed for a
I total of 97 yards and ran for
nearly 70 more to lead both
teams.
