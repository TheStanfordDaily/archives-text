### 
MOSCOW (UPD—The Soviet
Union warned in a formal state
ment yesterday it will continue its
atmospheric nuclear tests if the
United States decides to resume
testing in the atmosphere.
The statement, carried by the
official Tass news agency, blasted
President Kennedy’s announce
ment last week that the United
States may resume its nuclear
tests in the atmosphere.

Kennedy’s announcement, Tass
said, “confirms once again the
correctness of the Soviet govern
ment’s arguments in favor of re
suming nuclear tests in the Soviet
Union.”

Western observers in Moscow
said this was a clear warning that
Russia will continue its atmos
pheric tests, even after the cur
rent test series ends. ’The present
series included explosion of a
super bomb exceeding 50 mega
tons last Monday.
