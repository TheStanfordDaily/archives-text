# $2.5 Million Donated For PACE Buildings
## Profs Get Clubhouse 
### 
Stanford will receive $1 million
to build a new home for its Fac
ulty Club. President Wallace
Sterling disclosed this weekend.
A major component in the Uni
versity’s $lOO million PACE Pro
gram, Ihe long-needed building
will be financed from a trust fund
established in the will of Mrs.
Lucie Stern, a benefactor whose
name has become a campus by
word.
THE PLEDGED GIFT of $1
million was made through Walter
Haas, the fupd trustee, long famil
iar with Mrs. Stern’s devotion to
the University community.
Sterling announced the gift at
a meeting of the F’aculty Club.
"The values to a University
faculty of having a first-rate Fac
ulty Club House can hardly be ex
aggerated,” Sterling said. “The
need for such a building at Stan
ford has become increasingly
critical during the past decade as
the Stanford faculty has increased
in size and as the old Clubhouse
had outlived its purpose. The op
portunity for the informal but
essential exchange of ideas and
experiences which every faculty
man hopes to have with his col
leagues in various acadehnic dis
ciplines is now greatly enhanced,
and I rejoice.”
THE NEW BUILDING will he
located near Tresidder Memorial
Union and Bowman Alumni
House. It will include a large
dining room and several small
ones, a general lounge, and a li
brary-reading room. A few rooms
may be provided for use by dis
tinguished guests or resident
scholars.
The Faculty Club now holds
dinner meetings once a month at
the Stanford Union. Its first
homo, built in 1907, was abandon
ed several years ago as complete
ly inadequate.
Even before the launching of
the PACE program, a committee
of the homeless Faculty Club
made a careful study of what was
needed and feasible in a new
building. The committee question
ed all faculty members about
the kinds of facilities they felt
should be included, and surveyed
services offered by similar cen
ters at other universities.
Funds from Mrs. Stern’s estate

have financed the construction of
Lucie Stern Hall, dedicated in
1950, and subsequent additions to
this building. Today, more than
600 students are housed in Stein
Hall, a continuing reminder of
the generosity and affection of
Mrs. Stern.
