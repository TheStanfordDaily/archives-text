David Packard, major gifts chairman of Stanford’s current PACE
program, today announced the largest individual gil t so far received
in the campaign—sl,soo,ooo for an Engineering Building.

This and the Stern donation 1
million. The donors are Mr. and
Altos Hills. i

Additional financing for the
$2,500,000 new home of Stanford’s
School of Engineering will come
from a part of a U.S. Defense De
partment grant to establish a
Center for Materials Research at
the University.

THIS is being set up under a
contract Stanford signed earlier
this year with the Advance Re
search Projects Agency tARPAi
of the Defense Department.

At Stanford, the School of En
gineering was reported jubilant
over the prospect of having its
first major building since con
struction of the original Quad.
Dean Joseph M. Pettit said the
new facilities will have a wide
effect in many areas of engineer
ing and science where the lag in
materials knowledge has been a
retarding factor.
Packard said the McCulloughs’
pledged gift pushed to well over
$26,000,000 the total so far given
and promised in the University’s
current $100,000,000 fund-raising
campaign for increased educa
tional excellence.

Commenting upon Stanford’s
leadership in the electronics field,
McCullough said industry owes
much to the long-range research
programs of universities.
“Science,must find new com
pounds to make new materials
for the space age,” he said, “and
new uses for old ones. Universi
ties and industry together in this
field can do much that will bene
fit all mankind.”
STANFORD President Wallace
Sterling said the nation is depend
ing more and more upon its uni
versities for ideas and creative
individuals in many fields of sci
ence and the humanities.

The new engineering building
will be a companion structure to
the Fussell H. Varian Laboratory
of Physics, already under con
struction on the Science Quad.
Architect Gardner A. Dailey of
San Francisco, who designed the
Physics Lecture Hall, is proceed
ing with plans for the new build
ing. The earliest possible date
will be set for construction; com
pletion is expected during 1963.
The need for such a building
has become increasingly apparent
since World War 11. New engi
neering departments have devel
oped for completely new fields.
Four times as many engineering
students are enrolled as there
were 20 years ago and three times
as many faculty members teach
them.

A TREMENDOUS accompany
ing growth in research activities
has enabled Stanford to educate
more men for advanced engineer
ing degrees than any school west
of the Mississippi, and to train
more Ph.D.’s in electrical engi
neering than any institution in
the U.S. Today, grants totaling
approximately $l5 million a year
support 90 separate research
projects.

“Science,must find new com

for the space age,” he said, “and
new uses for old ones. Universi

STANFORD President Wallace
Sterling said the nation is depend

The new engineering building
will be a companion structure to
the Fussell H. Varian Laboratory
of Physics, already under con
struction on the Science Quad.
Architect Gardner A. Dailey of
San Francisco, who designed the
Physics Lecture Hall, is proceed
ing with plans for the new build
ing. The earliest possible date
will be set for construction; com
pletion is expected during 1963.
The need for such a building
has become increasingly apparent
since World War 11. New engi
neering departments have devel
oped for completely new fields.
Four times as many engineering
students are enrolled as there
were 20 years ago and three times
as many faculty members teach
them.

A TREMENDOUS accompany
ing growth in research activities
has enabled Stanford to educate
more men for advanced engineer
ing degrees than any school west
of the Mississippi, and to train
more Ph.D.’s in electrical engi
neering than any institution in
the U.S. Today, grants totaling
approximately $l5 million a year
support 90 separate research
projects.

Additional financing for the
$2,500,000 new home of Stanford’s
School of Engineering will come
from a part of a U.S. Defense De
partment grant to establish a
Center for Materials Research at
the University.

THIS is being set up under a
contract Stanford signed earlier
this year with the Advance Re
search Projects Agency tARPAi
of the Defense Department.

At Stanford, the School of En
gineering was reported jubilant
over the prospect of having its
first major building since con
struction of the original Quad.
Dean Joseph M. Pettit said the
new facilities will have a wide
effect in many areas of engineer
ing and science where the lag in
materials knowledge has been a
retarding factor.
Packard said the McCulloughs’
pledged gift pushed to well over
$26,000,000 the total so far given
and promised in the University’s
current $100,000,000 fund-raising
campaign for increased educa
tional excellence.
