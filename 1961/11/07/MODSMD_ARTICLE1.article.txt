# Sterling Clarifies PACE Objectives, Freedom Issues
## 
### IDA RIGBY 
President Wallace Sterling yes
terday outlined the history and
objectives of PACE and clarified
misconcept ions which he feels stu
dents had concerning the effect
of PACE on academic and editori
al freedoms on the Farm. The
speech was sponsored by the
Stanford Today and Tomorrow
Committee.
Sterling said that the objectives
of the program are to “enhance
the strength and amplify the op
portunities of the University.” He
likened the University’s effort to
transmute PACE money into edu
cational opportunities to the al
chemists transmuting “base met
als to gold.”
STERLING ASSURED students
that the University had not com
promised its integrity by accept
ing the Ford Foundation award,
but was seizing the opportunity
it presented, since the money is
unrestricted in its use. Sterling
said that since the Stanford alum
ni are “by definition conserva
tive” and most of the money must
come from alumni, many students
have erroneously concluded that
Stanford itself has become con
servative.
He stressed that traditional
freedoms will not be curtailed for
the duration of the PACE cam
paign. “The test of a good univer
sity is its scholarship; scholar
ship cannot thrive amidst censor
ship.”
According to Sterling private
and public universities comple
ment each other; private institu
tions need private philanthropy
to exist. PACE is designed to
strengthen this particular private
institution.
BETWEEN 1957 and 1959 Stan
ford’s needs for the 1960's were
appraised, and the “Red Book,” a
compilation of findings and plans,
prepared.
In November 1959 Ford Foun
dation officers visited Stanford
and said they were contemplating
grants. Sterling said that “no
amount of fishing could get any
thing more definite than that
Stanford was the first institution
visited. This gave us a conceited
cold comfort, but we wanted
something warmer.” When the of
ficers asked about Stanford’s
plans for the future, they were
shown the Red Book. The notori
ously “poker-faced officers could
not conceal their surprise.”
In September 1960. $46 million
was granted to five private uni
versities. Stanford got $25 mil
lion; no other grant exceeded $6
million. Whereas Stanford has 5
years to match every dollar with
three, the others have three years
to match every dollar with two.
At a yearly accounting Stanford
gets its earnings for that year.
Although during the first year
more emphasis was placed on or
ganization than on collecting, $4.2
million was earned.
AT FIRST efforts will be di
rected toward major gifts $lOO,-
000 or more. Brochures will be
published to acquaint people with
Stanford and its goals. Included
in the $27 million collected to
date are four donations of $1 mil
lion or more.

Among PACE benefits to stu
dents are increased University

strength and stature, a new un
dergraduate library, new resi
dences, and financial aid. With
the $1 million advanced by the
Ford Foundation Stanford pro
vided salaries for new faculty
members of established stature to
teach undergraduates and in
creased student financial aid.
Sterling said that students can
help PACE by “doing well at their
prime responsibility—being good
students, and by keeping as well
informed about PACE as their
inclinations and time permit.”
HE SAID HE takes pride in the
award to Stanford of such a large
part of the 46 million and feels
“Stanford merits the confidence
implicit in the award.” Stanford’s
record of “self help” during post
war years work by faculty,
trustees, alumni and friends
shows that Stanford can do the
job.
Sterling feels that Stanford’s
singular strength in the far west
and its academic progress in the
1950’s establishment of over
seas campuses, enlargement of
faculty, research progress—and
the quality of the student body
influenced the Foundation in its
decision. He feels that the Red
Book, by showing Stanford again
taking initiative in self help,
strongly Influenced their decision.
Another object of the Founda
tion was to raise the level of fi
nancial support after PACE.
Sterling said that as people learn
about Stanford they become en
thusiastic, and enthusiasm brings
success.

Of the $lOO million Stanford
hopes to have by August, 1965,
$4O million will be used for new
buildings and renovating old
ones, $3O million for endowments,
and the rest to sustain continuous
progress of the university. He
stressed that the $lOO million
covers only the “hard core” needs
of the university which were
given priority.
