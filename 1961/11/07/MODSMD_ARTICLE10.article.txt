# Fire Rages, Biggest in LA History
## 
### 
BEIVERLY HILLS, Calif. (UPI)
Eire tinned the Santa Monica
mountains and plush Bel Air into
a war-like holocaust yesterday,
destroying from 120 to 175 expen
sive homes and forcing evacua
tion of 3,000 persons—including
Richard M. Nixon.
“This is the biggest fire disas
ter in the city’s history,’’ said Los
Angeles Mayor Samuel Yorty.
THE FIRE —burning northwest
of here— actually is within the
Los Angeles city limits although
some 20 miles from the City Hall.
The Fire Department estimated
about 120 homes lost. But a Unit
ed Press International man at the
scene counted at least 175 homes
burned.
Value of the homes destroyed
ranged from $50,000 to $250,000.
Lots alone were valued at $30,000.
FIRE CHIEF William L. Miller
had 2,000 fire fighters in the hills.
But he said there was no hope
for control last night. Winds
reaching 100 miles per hour in
the fire storms, extreme low hu
midity and a lack of water handi
capped efforts to control the fire.
Seven firemen and eight civil
ians, mostly home owners, were
reported injured, two seriously.
Nixon was trying to water
down the house on Bundy Drive
in Bel Air he rents from director
Walter Lang when firemen or
dered him to evacuate.
MRS. PAT NIXON and the
couple’s two children were not at
home. But the maid, Hannah Ree,
had had to rescue “Checkers,” the
family dog, that was reluctant to
leave.
A second fire broke out about
three miles west of the major
fire. The fire, near Mulholland
Highway and Topanga Canyon,
burned more than 2,000 acres by
late afternoon. Many homes in
the area were evacuated as a
precaution.
The major burn frustrated fire
fighters by burning both south
easterly and southwesterly from
the point of origin. IF fanned in
a southwesterly direction toward
part of Bel Air, while also mov
ing southeasterly toward Beverly
Glen generally resembling a cut
of pie in shape.

BEIVERLY HILLS, Calif. (UPI)
Eire tinned the Santa Monica
mountains and plush Bel Air into
a war-like holocaust yesterday,
destroying from 120 to 175 expen
sive homes and forcing evacua
tion of 3,000 persons—including
Richard M. Nixon.
“This is the biggest fire disas
ter in the city’s history,’’ said Los
Angeles Mayor Samuel Yorty.
THE FIRE —burning northwest
of here— actually is within the
Los Angeles city limits although
some 20 miles from the City Hall.
The Fire Department estimated
about 120 homes lost. But a Unit
ed Press International man at the
scene counted at least 175 homes
burned.
Value of the homes destroyed
ranged from $50,000 to $250,000.
Lots alone were valued at $30,000.
