# 'Winds of freedom' Won't fade Away
## 
### 
For those who went into it with a reasonably open mind, Presi
dent Sterling’s speech yesterday outlining the PACE program should
have qualmed any fears that the “winds of freedom” will fade into
soft breezes while the mammoth drive is conducted.
Those who expected startling new revelations about the drive
must have been disappointed. AH Dr. Sterling did was to give a
general rundown on the PACE objectives, history and its relation
to students—the last a long overdue topic of attention by the admin
istration. But this is what he set out to do, and we feel the speech
cleared up misapprehensions many students had regarding PACE.
Dr. Sterling declared that academic freedom and student free
dom would be in no way curtailed because of PACE. As he put it,
“scholarship cannot thrive on censorship.” This has been the Uni
versity’s guiding policy since 1891, and we are willing to accept
Dr. Sterling’s word that it will continue to be.
It is interesting that the more one speaks to new members of
the faculty and administration, the more one hears them refer to
Stanford’s tradition of freedom as a prime factor in their moving
here. It seems to ns that if top scholars and administrators—people
who would by nature abhor and avoid curtailment of academic free
dom-make a point of mentioning Stanford’s academic freedom,
then we do not need to look behind every classroom podium for
agents of the administration, as some would have us do.
This is not to say that Stanford does not harbor those who would
prefer to avoid controversy, who would hire only “safe” teachers
and keep them firmly in line. We have such persons. But we are
confident that they are the ones who will be kept firmly in line.
We think it also is worth noting, for those who are skeptical as
to what PACE can or will do for them. Dr. Sterling’s remarks on
the use made of the $1 million advanced to the University by the
Ford Foundation “on account.”
The president pointed out that some of this money was used to
pay salaries of a number of distinguished professors who joined the
staff this fall. Any student who is fortunate enough to be in a class
taught by one of these men certainly cannot honestly say that PACE
has done nothing for him.
We could go on listing reasons why PACE is vital to the future
of the University and why it needs the support of a student body
which, when it refers to PACE, knows what it is talking about.
But we think Dr. Sterling made it clear that PACE is not some
sort of insidious scheme. While a certain amount of student sar
casm is normal and to be expected in a situation such as this, a much
larger amount of understanding on the part of the students is re
quired and—we feel—will be forthcoming from those who are sin
cerely concerned with Stanford’s future.

general rundown on the PACE objectives, history and its relation
to students—the last a long overdue topic of attention by the admin
istration. But this is what he set out to do, and we feel the speech
cleared up misapprehensions many students had regarding PACE.
Dr. Sterling declared that academic freedom and student free
dom would be in no way curtailed because of PACE. As he put it,
“scholarship cannot thrive on censorship.” This has been the Uni
versity’s guiding policy since 1891, and we are willing to accept
Dr. Sterling’s word that it will continue to be.
It is interesting that the more one speaks to new members of
the faculty and administration, the more one hears them refer to
Stanford’s tradition of freedom as a prime factor in their moving
here. It seems to ns that if top scholars and administrators—people
who would by nature abhor and avoid curtailment of academic free
dom-make a point of mentioning Stanford’s academic freedom,
then we do not need to look behind every classroom podium for
agents of the administration, as some would have us do.
This is not to say that Stanford does not harbor those who would
prefer to avoid controversy, who would hire only “safe” teachers
and keep them firmly in line. We have such persons. But we are
confident that they are the ones who will be kept firmly in line.
We think it also is worth noting, for those who are skeptical as
to what PACE can or will do for them. Dr. Sterling’s remarks on
the use made of the $1 million advanced to the University by the
Ford Foundation “on account.”
The president pointed out that some of this money was used to
pay salaries of a number of distinguished professors who joined the
staff this fall. Any student who is fortunate enough to be in a class
taught by one of these men certainly cannot honestly say that PACE
has done nothing for him.
We could go on listing reasons why PACE is vital to the future
of the University and why it needs the support of a student body
which, when it refers to PACE, knows what it is talking about.
But we think Dr. Sterling made it clear that PACE is not some
sort of insidious scheme. While a certain amount of student sar
casm is normal and to be expected in a situation such as this, a much
larger amount of understanding on the part of the students is re
quired and—we feel—will be forthcoming from those who are sin
cerely concerned with Stanford’s future.
For those who went into it with a reasonably open mind, Presi
dent Sterling’s speech yesterday outlining the PACE program should
have qualmed any fears that the “winds of freedom” will fade into
soft breezes while the mammoth drive is conducted.
Those who expected startling new revelations about the drive
must have been disappointed. AH Dr. Sterling did was to give a
