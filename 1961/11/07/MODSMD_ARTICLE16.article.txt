A remarkable rebirth of con
servatism has occurred on college
campuses across the nation in the
past five years, and local and
national young conservative
groups have become increasingly
more numerous and influential in
both campus and national affairs.
In a recent survey of a cross
section of Stanford students, 43
per cent rated themselves “more
conservative than liberal.”
This outwardly improbable de
velopment is chronicled by one of
its most important leaders, 27-
year-old Stanton Evans, editor of
the Indianapolis News, in this
very succinct and readable book.
THE REVOLUTIONARY force
described in “Revolt on the Cam
pus” is, of course, the young con
servative. He is the rebel, the
“out,” today while the conformist
in national politics and campus
thought, Evans explains, is the
liberal.
Skillfully linking liberalism to
conformity and other-directive
ness and conservatism to individu
al enterprise and inner-direction,
using the Reisman idiom, Evans
relates the changes on campuses
today to disillusionment with
world and national politics and to
the natural tendencies of youth to
seek new solutions.

The going order is liberalism,
the “new idea” is conservatism,
and Evans sees the pendulum be
ginning to swing back.
ASSUMING the difficult role of
both analyst and spokesman for
the young conservative move

merit, Evans carefully weighs his
optimism and presents probably
the most articulate analysis of
the college conservative.
He reviews conservative move
ments on numerous college cam
puses, including Stanford, and
lists in detail the accomplish
ments and failures of the young
conservatives up through the
early months of the Kennedy Ad
ministration.
In particular, he stresses the
role of the young conservatives in
the rise of Barry Goldwater as a
national figure and in the surpris
ing popularity of Richard Nixon
in college presidential preference
polls last year.
EVANS' DEVOTES separate
chapters to discussions of the
character of such youth groups as
the Young Americans for Free
dom, the Intercollegiate Society
of Individualists and the National
Student Association (NSA).
Also rating full analysis are
such recent developments as the
National Defense Education Act
loyalty oath battle and the new
conservative control of the nation
al Young Republican federation.
Although openly partisan and
vitally interested in the subject,
Evans is often very frank in his
analysis and offers a particularly
good insight into the goals and
prospects of this surprisingly
large number of college students.
Both as an articulate spokes
man for the young conservatives
on campuses across the country
and as a chronicler of their
achievements, Evans is unques
tionably a success in “Revolt on
the Campus,” a book that is cer
tain to affirm his position as a
front-rank leader of young con
servatives.
