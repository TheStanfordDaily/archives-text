U.S. OLD, SIC K?
Editor, The Daily:
Here we sit, at the edge of the
continent men conquered with
their sweat. We ask ourselves;
what is thei’e left to do?
Many reply: we must preserve
our American way of life! And
they get out the oils and the spices
and cloth, and embalm us ail
against the ravages of time. The
continent has been conquered, the
democratic government has been
established, let us now turn our
energies to the protection against
decay.
Implicit is the conviction that
there is a limit on both our
growth an d vitality. Having
reached the limit of our territori
al expansion, we turn around and
survey what a nice job we’ve
done. Having reached all but the
last strongholds against internal
democracy—denial of civil rights,
inexpensive education for the
able—we turn to survey our hap
py state. We have arrived.
The completion of our two
goals must lead to a decision. Do
we go on; do we establish democ
racy throughout the . . . world?
Or do we stay here and attempt
to keep the worms away from our
paralyzed body?
Africa has recognized its own
existence and is moving . . . China
after a long sleep, has regained
consciousness. China has turned
away from the wall building and
closed-door attitude toward world
life. Asia, Africa and South
America contain living and grow
ing societies.
These growing societies repre
sent a new strain. They are tough,
treacherous and tenacious. They
have an inordinant will to live.
They concentrate on the expan
sion of their national life.
To the young and vibrant, the
creative and imaginative solu
tions are the best. Ideals, hopes
and aspirations spur them on. To
the old and sick, the avoidance of
death and decay commands first
place in their thoughts.
Is there really nothing left for
America to do? Or have we just
become too old and too sick to at
tempt the effort?

They concentrate on the expan
sion of their national life.
To the young and vibrant, the
creative and imaginative solu
tions are the best. Ideals, hopes
and aspirations spur them on. To
the old and sick, the avoidance of
death and decay commands first
place in their thoughts.
Is there really nothing left for
America to do? Or have we just
become too old and too sick to at
tempt the effort?
