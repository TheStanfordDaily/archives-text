SUNDAY FLICKS
Lditor, The Daily:
Long ago in Rome there existed
a large theater called the Colos
seum. It was inaugurated by the
Emperor Titus as a memorial to
the valiant dead of Rome.
Here on pleasant weekend aft
ernoons it was the custom of the
populace to pass their time in
watching epic extravaganzas pul
on by the committee on cultural
progress. The audience took great
delight in su c h dramas as
“slaughter the Christian” and
“run lady run” (or he’ll catch
you) and when such a presenta
tion was in progress, would ex
press their approval with growls
of approval and much slapping
of one pudgy palm against the
other.
Audience participation was en
couraged and great ingenuity
was put into such group efforts
as “thumbs up-thumbs down” (a
game requiring great manual dex
terity) and “comments rank,
ranker, rankest” (a game requir
ing great mental dexterity).
And every so often a really
good scene, i.e. a mother, child in
arms, running around and around
the arena closely pursued by a
lion would prompt some intel
lectually aware Individual, braver
that his fellows, to utter some
brilliant witticism such as, “Go!
Go! Go!”
Although the Colosseum has
fallen to ruin and the might of
Rome has passed down the worn
way of empire, she has left us her
legacy. Her methods of appreci
ation are still slavishly applied
to truth and beauty by mobs the
world over. James Olson
