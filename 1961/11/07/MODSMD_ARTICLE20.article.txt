# DROP BERLIN AGREEMENT?
## Exchange Student from Free University Speaks 
### JURGEN LANGE 
A dispute has arisen at Stan
ford as to whether it would be
sensible to drop the exchange pro
gram with the Free University of
West Berlin.

This first exchange program
Stanford began has now been
continued for 10 years. Being the
1961-62 exchange student from
the Free University I feel obliged
to express my opinion in this mat
ter.
In the aim of coming to a bet
ter international understanding
after the terrible events of World
War 11, exchange programs were
started all over the world. Student
exchange programs on the inter
national level were Intensified so
that some 50,000 foreign students
are now studying at American
universities.
ON THE other side, a large
number of American students are
studying at various universities
abroad.
Who would want to question
the importance of such a large
scale exchange program as a sig
nificant contribution toward life
in a more peaceful world of to
morrow?
Stanford really started to play
an active part in this program
when it inaugurated the Berlin
exchange with the Free Universi
ty. In the 10 years the program
has been pursued, good contacts
have been established on both
sides.
WHEN THE exchange was
started the Free University was
a very young campus, only three
years old. However, the universi
ty could look back upon a very
reputable history of nearly 150
years.
After the Prussian state had
been defeated by Napoleon, the
famous German scientist and
statesman, Wilhelm von Hum
boldt, saw the need of building up
a new center of intellectual life
in Berlin.
This led to the establishment
of Humboldt University, which
was soon to become Germany’s
largest campus, with 17,000 stu
dents enrolled.
IT BROUGHT forth such re
markable professors and students
as Nietzsche, Hegel, Marx and
various others. After the division
of Berlin in the post-war years,
the Communists seized control of
the university.
Finally, when Communists
used political pressure against
students who were favoring dem
ocratic reforms, the Free Univer
sity was founded in West Berlin.
Two years after the Communist
Berlin Blockade of 1948-49, the
first exchange of students be
tween Stanford and the Free Uni
versity took place.
WITH the help of the Western
Allies, mainly due to the Ameri
can effort, the citizens of Berlin
had survived the dangerous year
of the Blockade, although it often
meant no) having enough food or
fuel during the cold winter.
After the breaking of the
Blockade the Berliners were eager
to rebuild their city which had
been destroyed in war and to se
cure for themselves a desirable
standard of living. This was the
situation in the city with which
the first Stanford exchange stu
dent was confronted upon his ar
rival.

Nobody would have then as
sumed that in not quite 10 years
we woukl have a new crisis over
Berlin which this time is even
linked with the threat of nuclear
war. At the moment, everything
the Berliners have achieved since
the Blockade their freedom,
peace and standard of living—are
endangered.
IT IS DIFFICULT, if not even
impossible, for foreigners to
imagine what life in Berlin is
like after the erection of the wall
by the Communists on Aug. 13.
Friends and families living in
different parts of one and the
same city are no longer able to
visit each other. The 25 miles of
wall that now separate both parts
of Berlin are without a gap, so
that it is completely impossible
for a citizen to cross the border.
But still worse than that is that
lor the past few weeks police and
soldiers who speak the same lan
guage and belong to the same na
tion but are standing on differ
ent sides of the border have
been shooting at each other.
• AT THE SAME time tanks of
the American and Russian forces
have been lined up along the wall.
All this is happening in a city of
3.3 million inhabitants! In such a
tense situation it is, I think neces
sary for friends to intensify their
contacts and to support the en
dangered friend.
This is the political background
in which the proposed decision to
drop the exchange with the Free
University has to be seen. Due to
the Communist threat, the Ber
liners are looking for expected
signs of support.
Every other day I receive let
ters from German friends who
are most anxious to know some
thing about the attitude of the
American people toward Berlin.
I AM REPEATEDLY being
asked questions such as, "What
position do your American stu
dent friends take toward (he Ber

lin problem? Does the average
American really want to hold on
to Berlin? What opinion has he
got of possibilities for a German
reunification?”
In a moment like this Stanford
cannot expect the Berlin students
to understand the soundness of
the arguments for dropping the
exchange.
Any such attempt would only
be comparable with a “smack in
the face” of the Berlin student.
When facing such a dangerous
situation it is of vital importance
for the Berliners to be convinced
of the support of their friends all
over thp world.

In Berlin the free world is not
prepared 1 1 risk a worldwide
thermo-nuclear war solely for the
sake of 3.3 million citizens, but is,
I hope, willing to secure and de
fend the fundamental inalienable
rights of our societies.
