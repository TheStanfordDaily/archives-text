QUESTION: To what extent
have students played a part in
determination of the way PACE
funds are to be expended?
Answered by Kenneth Cuth
bertson. vice president for finan
cial affairs.
“Students have played a signi
ficant role in determination of the
proposed $lOO million PACE pro
gram expenditures mainly by be
ing students—increasingly more
able and inquiring students
rather than by attempting to be
come University planners.
“MANY YEARS’ experience,
planning and reflection on the
paid of faculty, officers and trus
tees determined the highest prior
ity expenditures in the PACE pro
gram. During these years stu
dents, through their everyday re
actions, accomplishments, fail
ures, freely expressed opinions
and needs, have had an obvious
influence.
“For example, the undergradu
ates’ growing interest in inde
pendent work with books height
ened the need for an undergradu
ate library. Similarly, the quality
of graduate student scholarship
requires renovation of the main
library and the expansion of busi
ness, law and engineering li
braries.
“Students have shown enthusi
asm for honors programs and for
opportunities to work intensively
with faculty. The costs of meeting
the resultant need for expanding
and strengthening the faculty
represent a large segment of the
PACE program.
“IN PARTS OF the $lOO million
expenditure plan, students have
participated directly. Student ad
visory committees had a strong
voice in planning the proposed
Student Publications Building.
“New undergraduate residences
will be an extension of a general
design adapted after formal con
sultation with student representa
tives. Also, student suggestions
are being incorporated in the re
novation of some existing student
residences.
“This direct participation often
has been frustrating to individual
students because plans seldom
materialize quickly enough for
them to see results during the un
dergraduate years.
“Students do much more than
help determine expenditure plans.
Without students of outstanding
potential, the money-raising por
tion of the program would fail
because Stanford could not hope
to interest many donors in mak
ing large investments in a second
rate institution.
“And without students willing
to make serious use of their out
standing potential, there would
be no point in the money-spend
ing portion of the PACE pro
gram.”

“MANY YEARS’ experience,
planning and reflection on the
paid of faculty, officers and trus
tees determined the highest prior
ity expenditures in the PACE pro
gram. During these years stu
dents, through their everyday re
actions, accomplishments, fail
ures, freely expressed opinions
and needs, have had an obvious
influence.
“For example, the undergradu
ates’ growing interest in inde
pendent work with books height
ened the need for an undergradu
ate library. Similarly, the quality
of graduate student scholarship
requires renovation of the main
library and the expansion of busi
ness, law and engineering li
braries.
“Students have shown enthusi
asm for honors programs and for
opportunities to work intensively
with faculty. The costs of meeting
the resultant need for expanding
and strengthening the faculty
represent a large segment of the
PACE program.
“IN PARTS OF the $lOO million
expenditure plan, students have
participated directly. Student ad
visory committees had a strong
voice in planning the proposed
Student Publications Building.
“New undergraduate residences
will be an extension of a general
design adapted after formal con
sultation with student representa
tives. Also, student suggestions
are being incorporated in the re
novation of some existing student
residences.
“This direct participation often
has been frustrating to individual
students because plans seldom
materialize quickly enough for
them to see results during the un
dergraduate years.
“Students do much more than
help determine expenditure plans.
Without students of outstanding
potential, the money-raising por
tion of the program would fail
because Stanford could not hope
to interest many donors in mak
ing large investments in a second
rate institution.
“And without students willing
to make serious use of their out
standing potential, there would
be no point in the money-spend
ing portion of the PACE pro
gram.”

QUESTION: To what extent
have students played a part in

funds are to be expended?
Answered by Kenneth Cuth
