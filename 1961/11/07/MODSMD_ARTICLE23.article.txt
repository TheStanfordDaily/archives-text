# Walter Lippmann
## Kennedy and Adenauer 
### 
When Dr. Adenauer has been
re-elected Chancellor, as wo must
hope he soon will be, ho and the
President will want to come to a
full understanding. It is badly
needed. For there is at present a
dangerous lack of understanding,
as witness the outcries about be
trayal and appeasement accom
panied by warnings and threats
that the Germans might leave the
Western Alliance to make a deal
with the Soviet Union.
A satisfactory understanding
will need to be something more
than a superficial agreement on
what may be mentioned and what
may not be mentioned in a nego
tiation with the Soviet Union. A
true understanding will have to
go far beyond the tactical prob
lems of negotiation with the
Communists.
A true understanding will have
to be found at the level of the
highest policy, and it will have to
deal with the future of Germany
and the future of the United
States in this period of world his
tory.
LOOKING BAC K, we can now
see that the great issues which
confront us today were generated
between 1949 and 1954—between
the formation of the Coal and
Steel Community and the admis
sion of West Germany to the
N.A.T.O. alliance. During those
five years or so, decisions were
taken to integrate a rearmed
Western Germany in the politi
cal, military, and economic com
munity of the West.
Dr. Adenauer played a leading
part in these decisions. They have
had two enormous consequences,
both of which have come to fruit
simultaneously in the past few
months.
One is the movement towards
Western unity, which took a de
cisive turn when Great Britain
moved to join the Continent. This
is bound to be followed by a train
of events w'hich will bring the
United States into a much closer
relationship with the whole of
non-Communist Europe.
THE OTHER consequence of
the action of 1954, by which West
Germany joined N.A.T.0., is that
reunion with East Germany
ceased for the time being to be
practical politics.
The President and the Chancel
lor will need to come first to an
understanding on how they can
work together as loyal and effec
tive partners in the construction
of the Atlantic Community. They
will then need an understanding
on how —given the fact of Ger
man participation West Ger
many and the Western Alliance
are to deal with East Germany
and Eastern Europe.
In order to reach a German-
American understanding it will be
necessary to clear away the de
bris of an old policy that has col
lapsed. The policy consisted in
promising—always most ambigu
ously—that Dr. Adenauer’s gov
ernment, backed by the might of
the United States, would some
how cause the Soviet Union to
surrender East Germany. This
policy had as its formula reunifi
cation by free elections. It has
also been widely advertised as
the policy of the liberation of the
captive nations.
THE POLICY was never truly
serious. It was never in fact sin
cere. For the United States and
the Western Allies, and Western
Germany no less, have never had
any intention of fighting a war to
reunify Germany or to liberate
Eastern Europe.
The whole policy has been a
shabby hoax.
Three times the policy has been
proved publicly and spectacularly
a hoax—when the East Germans
rebelled and we did not help them,
when the Hungarians rebelled and
we did not help them, when Berlin
was cut in two by the erection of
a wall and we acquiesced.

The demonstrated truth is that
the status quo in Germany is par
tition, and it is on that fact that
policy has now to be formed. This
is regrettable. But if anyone is to

be blamed, it is Hitler, who start
ed the war and lost it.
IF WE AND the Germans are
to go forward together, it will be
as partners in the Atlantic Com
munity, neither questioning the
loyalty of the other, neither treat
ing the partnership as fragile and
subject to operatic tantrums.
The building of the Atlantic
Community is an enormous un
dertaking, and the Western Allies
cannot spend all of their time
and energy crying out about the
collapsed illusions of 1954. For
our part we shall have to do a
great deal of hard work. We shall
have to engage in prolonged de
bate to decide how we will adjust
ourselves to the revolutionary
changes which the greatly en
larged Common Market is precip
itating.
So it is not unreasonable, nor is
it a rebirth of isolationism, but
only common sense and practical
necessity, if we say to Dr. Ade
nauer, as indeed we are already
saying, that the Federal Republic
will have to play an adult part
and take more responsibility than
it takes today for working out
livable relations with Eastern
Germany and Eastern Europe.

on how —given the fact of Ger
man participation West Ger
many and the Western Alliance
are to deal with East Germany
and Eastern Europe.
In order to reach a German-
American understanding it will be
necessary to clear away the de
bris of an old policy that has col
lapsed. The policy consisted in
promising—always most ambigu
ously—that Dr. Adenauer’s gov
ernment, backed by the might of
the United States, would some
how cause the Soviet Union to
surrender East Germany. This
policy had as its formula reunifi
cation by free elections. It has
also been widely advertised as
the policy of the liberation of the
captive nations.
THE POLICY was never truly
serious. It was never in fact sin
cere. For the United States and
the Western Allies, and Western
Germany no less, have never had
any intention of fighting a war to
reunify Germany or to liberate
Eastern Europe.
The whole policy has been a
shabby hoax.
Three times the policy has been
proved publicly and spectacularly
a hoax—when the East Germans
rebelled and we did not help them,
when the Hungarians rebelled and
we did not help them, when Berlin
was cut in two by the erection of
a wall and we acquiesced.

The demonstrated truth is that
the status quo in Germany is par
tition, and it is on that fact that
policy has now to be formed. This
is regrettable. But if anyone is to

be blamed, it is Hitler, who start
ed the war and lost it.
IF WE AND the Germans are
to go forward together, it will be
as partners in the Atlantic Com
munity, neither questioning the
loyalty of the other, neither treat
ing the partnership as fragile and
subject to operatic tantrums.
The building of the Atlantic
Community is an enormous un
dertaking, and the Western Allies
cannot spend all of their time
and energy crying out about the
collapsed illusions of 1954. For
our part we shall have to do a
great deal of hard work. We shall
have to engage in prolonged de
bate to decide how we will adjust
ourselves to the revolutionary
changes which the greatly en
larged Common Market is precip
itating.
So it is not unreasonable, nor is
it a rebirth of isolationism, but
only common sense and practical
necessity, if we say to Dr. Ade
nauer, as indeed we are already
saying, that the Federal Republic
will have to play an adult part
and take more responsibility than
it takes today for working out
livable relations with Eastern
Germany and Eastern Europe.

When Dr. Adenauer has been
re-elected Chancellor, as wo must
hope he soon will be, ho and the
President will want to come to a
full understanding. It is badly
needed. For there is at present a
dangerous lack of understanding,
as witness the outcries about be
trayal and appeasement accom
panied by warnings and threats
that the Germans might leave the
Western Alliance to make a deal
with the Soviet Union.
A satisfactory understanding
will need to be something more
than a superficial agreement on
what may be mentioned and what
may not be mentioned in a nego
tiation with the Soviet Union. A
true understanding will have to
go far beyond the tactical prob
lems of negotiation with the
Communists.
A true understanding will have
to be found at the level of the
highest policy, and it will have to
deal with the future of Germany
and the future of the United
States in this period of world his
tory.
LOOKING BAC K, we can now
see that the great issues which
confront us today were generated
between 1949 and 1954—between
the formation of the Coal and
Steel Community and the admis
sion of West Germany to the
N.A.T.O. alliance. During those
five years or so, decisions were
taken to integrate a rearmed
Western Germany in the politi
cal, military, and economic com
munity of the West.
Dr. Adenauer played a leading
part in these decisions. They have
had two enormous consequences,
both of which have come to fruit
simultaneously in the past few
months.
One is the movement towards
Western unity, which took a de
cisive turn when Great Britain
moved to join the Continent. This
is bound to be followed by a train
of events w'hich will bring the
United States into a much closer
relationship with the whole of
non-Communist Europe.
THE OTHER consequence of
the action of 1954, by which West
Germany joined N.A.T.0., is that
reunion with East Germany
ceased for the time being to be
practical politics.
The President and the Chancel
lor will need to come first to an
understanding on how they can
work together as loyal and effec
tive partners in the construction
of the Atlantic Community. They
will then need an understanding
on how —given the fact of Ger

are to deal with East Germany

necessity, if we say to Dr. Ade
nauer, as indeed we are already
saying, that the Federal Republic
will have to play an adult part
and take more responsibility than
it takes today for working out
livable relations with Eastern
Germany and Eastern Europe.

When Dr. Adenauer has been
re-elected Chancellor, as wo must
hope he soon will be, ho and the
President will want to come to a
full understanding. It is badly
needed. For there is at present a
dangerous lack of understanding,
as witness the outcries about be
trayal and appeasement accom
panied by warnings and threats
that the Germans might leave the
Western Alliance to make a deal
with the Soviet Union.
A satisfactory understanding
will need to be something more
than a superficial agreement on
what may be mentioned and what
may not be mentioned in a nego
tiation with the Soviet Union. A
true understanding will have to
go far beyond the tactical prob
lems of negotiation with the
Communists.
A true understanding will have
to be found at the level of the
highest policy, and it will have to
deal with the future of Germany
and the future of the United
States in this period of world his
tory.
LOOKING BAC K, we can now
see that the great issues which
confront us today were generated
between 1949 and 1954—between
the formation of the Coal and
Steel Community and the admis
sion of West Germany to the
N.A.T.O. alliance. During those
five years or so, decisions were
taken to integrate a rearmed
Western Germany in the politi
cal, military, and economic com
munity of the West.
Dr. Adenauer played a leading
part in these decisions. They have
had two enormous consequences,
both of which have come to fruit
simultaneously in the past few
months.
One is the movement towards
Western unity, which took a de
cisive turn when Great Britain
moved to join the Continent. This
is bound to be followed by a train
of events w'hich will bring the
United States into a much closer
relationship with the whole of
non-Communist Europe.
THE OTHER consequence of
the action of 1954, by which West
Germany joined N.A.T.0., is that
reunion with East Germany
ceased for the time being to be
practical politics.
The President and the Chancel
lor will need to come first to an
understanding on how they can
work together as loyal and effec
tive partners in the construction
of the Atlantic Community. They
will then need an understanding
on how —given the fact of Ger
man participation West Ger
many and the Western Alliance
are to deal with East Germany
and Eastern Europe.
In order to reach a German-
American understanding it will be
necessary to clear away the de
bris of an old policy that has col
lapsed. The policy consisted in
promising—always most ambigu
ously—that Dr. Adenauer’s gov
ernment, backed by the might of
the United States, would some
how cause the Soviet Union to
surrender East Germany. This
policy had as its formula reunifi
cation by free elections. It has
also been widely advertised as
the policy of the liberation of the
captive nations.
THE POLICY was never truly
serious. It was never in fact sin
cere. For the United States and
the Western Allies, and Western
Germany no less, have never had
any intention of fighting a war to
reunify Germany or to liberate
Eastern Europe.
The whole policy has been a
shabby hoax.
Three times the policy has been
proved publicly and spectacularly
a hoax—when the East Germans
rebelled and we did not help them,
when the Hungarians rebelled and
we did not help them, when Berlin
was cut in two by the erection of
a wall and we acquiesced.

The demonstrated truth is that
the status quo in Germany is par
tition, and it is on that fact that
policy has now to be formed. This
is regrettable. But if anyone is to

be blamed, it is Hitler, who start
ed the war and lost it.
IF WE AND the Germans are
to go forward together, it will be
as partners in the Atlantic Com
munity, neither questioning the
loyalty of the other, neither treat
ing the partnership as fragile and
subject to operatic tantrums.
The building of the Atlantic
Community is an enormous un
dertaking, and the Western Allies
cannot spend all of their time
and energy crying out about the
collapsed illusions of 1954. For
our part we shall have to do a
great deal of hard work. We shall
have to engage in prolonged de
bate to decide how we will adjust
ourselves to the revolutionary
changes which the greatly en
larged Common Market is precip
itating.
So it is not unreasonable, nor is
it a rebirth of isolationism, but
only common sense and practical
necessity, if we say to Dr. Ade
nauer, as indeed we are already
saying, that the Federal Republic
will have to play an adult part
and take more responsibility than
it takes today for working out
