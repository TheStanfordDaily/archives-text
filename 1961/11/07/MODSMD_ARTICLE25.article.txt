# LETTER FROM NIGERIA
## Peace Corps Problems 
### JUDY HOUTZ 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The author
of this article is studying: this
year as a private citizen at Uni
versity College, Ihadan, Nigeria.
She is a Stanford senior political
science major.)

When a Nigerian looks at his
own country the thing that
strikes his eye is not the mud
huts and naked children these
have been part of the African
scene as long as people have lived
on the continent it is the modern
hospitals, skyscrapers, universi
ties, factories, residential districts
and schools, all built within the
past 15 years and most of them
since 1956.
The Nigerian is called “the
Texan of Africa” and well ho
might be.
The list of facilities found in Ni
geria that are the first, the most,
the biggest, in all of Africa is
overwhelming.
TO ME the most impressive
single fact is that in one region
there is operating universal, free,
compulsory primary education. A
second region will have it within
three years, and the third is mak
ing great strides along the same
lines.
Three universities are in ses
sion now and within 10 years
there will be seven, at least three
with medical schools.
The Nigerian is desperately
proud of his country and her
achievements and he wants the
world to know. He is well aware
that the libraries of the wmrld are
filled with books on Africa writ
ten by armchair experts and
tourists, telling the world that he
is a savage living naked in a land
of lions and elephants.
HOW WELL he knows the su
perior tone and condescension and
anecdotes about the humorous in
nocence of the “native.” When
Miss Michelmore’s postcard was
read the students regarded it as
a deliberate and malicious slan
der.
The Peace Corps is suspect for

three reasons.
It is charity and as such car
ries an implication of inferiority.
The members are selected so
carefully that they might he in
actuality handpicked spies.
Finally, the Peace Corps is a
“tool of American foreign policy”
and may be a means of carrying
the Cold War to Nigeria. Every
student had these points in mind
when the unfortunate postcard
was discovered.

Feelings were aired at the Sun
day rally and the tension quickly
began to subside.
THE INCIDENT was very in
structive. The problems have
been made clear, the issues de
fined.
The Peace Cor ps was conceived
as a gesture of international
friendship and responsibility. In
addition to all of the foreseen ob
stacles it must overcome, it must
also overcome its awkwardness
as a gesture because whatever
else the Peace Corps may be*, it
is needed.
