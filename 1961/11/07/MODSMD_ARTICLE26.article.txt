# De Gaulle Sets Corsican Trip
## 
### 
PARIS (UPH Thousands of
riot policemen and gendarmes
from France yesterday bolstered
local security forces in Corsica
for the visit of President Charles
de Gaulle today.
The trip to the island birth
place of Napoleon is considered
De Gaulle’s most hazardous mis
sion since he returned to power
three years ago. Ironically, the
Corsicans played a major role in
that chapter in French history.
The Paris newspaper Le Figaro
last week reported that a plot to
kill De Gaulle had been un
covered, but there was no offi
cial confirmation.
Reports said an extra 10,000
riot police and gendarmes have
been sent from the mainland to
aid local security forces in pro
viding protection for De Gaulle.
A force of 4,000 riot police sent
from Marseille is expected to
form the backbone of the security
screen when De Gaulle drives by
car across the handit-infe-sted
mountains and speaks at public
rallies in the towns and cities.
De Gaulle’s plane is scheduled
to land at Bastia. He will spend
a day and a half on Corsica be
fore returning to metropolitan
France for a tour through the
Marseille-Toulon region.
The main reason De Gaulle’s
“meet-the-people” tour is consid
ered so risky is that many of
Corsica’s 250,000 inhabitants have
close family ties with non-Mos
lem settlers in Algeria.
