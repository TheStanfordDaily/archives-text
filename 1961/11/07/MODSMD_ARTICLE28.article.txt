# Demos-GOP Set to Split Off-Year Political Plums
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Demo
crats and Republicans were ex
pected to come out of today’s
scattered off-year elections shar
ing the two top prizes New
York’s City Hall and the State
House in New Jersey.
In contests that could have
some effect on the 1964 presiden
tial race, Democrats are favored
to re-elect Robert F. Wagner as
mayor of New York and the Re
publicans to win the New Jersey
governorship with former Labor
Secretary James P. Mitchell.
WHILE Wagner and Mitchell
hold the national spotlight, voters
also will elect hundreds of state
and city officials across the coun
try and rule on a variety of con
stitutional amendments and other
statewide propositions.
Ohio and New Jersey vote on
plans for keeping the government
going in case of nuclear attack.
Ohio also votes on an atomic-age
reorganization of the state mili

tia, including a plan to make
women eligible for service.
In Michigan, the Democrats
are expected to pick up their sec
ond congressional seat in four
days. Democrat Lucien N. Nedzi,
36, an attorney, is favored over
Republican Walter Czarnecki, 47,
to win the seat left vacant when
President Kennedy appointed for
mer Rep. Thaddeus M. Machro
wicz to be a federal judge.
THE special election is being
held in Michigan’s heavily Demo
cratic First District, which in
cludes Detroit.

Last Saturday, Democrat Hen
ry B. Gonzalez Jr. won a special
Congressional election in Texas’
San Antonio district, defeating
Republican John Goode by some
10,000 votes.

The New York mayoralty cam
paign has been the liveliest of
this year’s battles, with both par
ties calling in their top vote-get
ters to help out.
FORMER President Dwight D.
Eisenhower and Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller campaigned for State
Atty. Gen. Louis J. Lefkowitz in
hopes of making him New York’s
first Republican mayor in almost
50 years.

The Democrats, faced with a
party split in the city and state,
were aided by President Kenne
dy, who visited New York last
week and issued a statement on
behalf of Wagner. Earlier in the
campaign, Wagner was endorsed
by former President Harry S.
Truman.

If Wagner is returned to city
hall, he would be the man who
Kennedy would look to keep New
York State in the Democratic
column in 1964, assuming that
Rockefeller wins re-election as
governor next year.
A MITCHELL victory in New
Jersey would mean a lot to the
liberal wing of the GOP party.
He is politically akin to Rocke
feller in neighboring New York.

The slate also has been a na
tional battleground, with Eisen
hower appearing for Mitchell and
Kennedy for Democrat Richard J.
Hughes.
In other balloting, Virginia
elects a governor and other offi
cials in a state where the Demo
crats dominate. Kentucky elects
half of its state senate, all of its
state representatives, again in a
predominantly Democratic state.
Pennsylvania voters elect a
state Supreme Court justice, and
vote on a constitutional amend
ment which would permit a gov
ernor to succeed himself. Elec
tions, some nonpartisan, are be
ing held in cities ranging from
Hartford, Conn., in the east to
San Francisco on the Pacific
Coast. New York State alone
elects more than 450 mayors.
