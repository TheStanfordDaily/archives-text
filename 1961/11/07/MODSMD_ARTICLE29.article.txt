# 'Freshman Class Smart, Alumni Children'—Snyder
## 
### 
One out of five freshmen at
Stanford this year comes from
an alumni family, Admissions Di
rector Rixford K. Snyder writes
in the current Stanford Alumni
Review.
This is a tribute to alumni in
terest in Stanford, as well as a
credit to the abilities of their
children, Snyder indicates.

THIS YEAR, he reports, 26 per
cent of the 446 freshman girls
are daughters of alumni parents,
and 17 per cent of the 916 boys
are alumni children. Last fall’s
crop placed the frosh men in a
higher percentage bracket than
the girls.
Taking a wide-screen look at
the whole class, Snyder com
ments; "The time-worn cliche
that you can’t find brains, beuaty,
brawn, personality and leadership
all wrapped up in the same per
son has been disproved.”
In an analysis he found that of
the 916 boys in the class, 244 or
26.6 per cent won varsity letters
in high school football; 214
achieved this recognition in track
and 176 in basketball.
ONE HUNDRED seven of them
were student body presidents. All
were active in some phase of
high school life, ranging from vo
cal, orchestral and band music,
major sports, class officers, edi
tors, debaters, dramatics and less
er student body offices.
Of the 446 girls, more than 25
per cent held student body offices
and more than 20 per cent served
as editors of their' school publi
cations.
“All of them at the same time,”
reported Snyder, “were making
‘good’ to ‘superior’ academic rec
ords in strong college prepara
tory programs.”
IN HIS article, Snyder cited
what is probably one of the most
remarkable freshman students in
Stanford’s 71-year history.

OH? This interesting sign is to
be found on the side of Har
mony House across from Roble
Hall. It is the site of a political
science project—and an unusual
campus sign.

Taking a wide-screen look at
the whole class, Snyder com
ments; "The time-worn cliche
that you can’t find brains, beuaty,
brawn, personality and leadership
all wrapped up in the same per
son has been disproved.”
In an analysis he found that of
the 916 boys in the class, 244 or
26.6 per cent won varsity letters
in high school football; 214
achieved this recognition in track
and 176 in basketball.
ONE HUNDRED seven of them
were student body presidents. All
were active in some phase of
high school life, ranging from vo
cal, orchestral and band music,
major sports, class officers, edi
tors, debaters, dramatics and less
er student body offices.
Of the 446 girls, more than 25
per cent held student body offices
and more than 20 per cent served
as editors of their' school publi
cations.
“All of them at the same time,”
reported Snyder, “were making
‘good’ to ‘superior’ academic rec
ords in strong college prepara
tory programs.”
IN HIS article, Snyder cited
what is probably one of the most
remarkable freshman students in
Stanford’s 71-year history.

OH? This interesting sign is to
be found on the side of Har
mony House across from Roble
Hall. It is the site of a political
science project—and an unusual
campus sign.
