# Injury Situation Better —Thurlow to Face Cal
## 
### 
Stanford’s football team is
closer to full strength than it has
been since the start of the season.
Only one injury occurred over
the weekend, while all but one
of the walking wounded are
ready to go at full strength.
Top defensive halfback Gary
Sargent was kicked in the ankle
in the first half of Saturday’s
game. He played out the game,
but the ankle has swollen con
siderably. Sargent can’t run and
may miss next week’s tilt with
USC.
JAY WARD, sophomore full
back, has a sore knee, but will
be able to go against the Tro
jans.
Quarterback Steve Thurlow is
still in the hospital, but he will
be released tomorrow. Trainer
Connie Jarvis’ time schedule for
Thurlow has him practicing next
M on d ay, with his seeing any
action against Washington State
doubtful. Thurlow will be ready
for the annual “large contest”
with California.
Others, such as fullbacks Tony
DeLellis and Ken Babajian, are
okeh.
JACK CURTICE had some hard
words at the Northern California
Football Writers’ Luncheon held
yesterday in San Francisco. “That
Mel Renfro is a scallawag! He
is the only man on either team
who could have scored on his
four-yard touchdown run. The
hole was too small for his shoul

ders, so he turned sideways and
dived in.”
Curtice said he was told last
Friday, before the Oregon game,
that Renfro would be unable to
play, since he still was troubled
with an ankle injury. Renfro pro
ceeded to ruin the Indians, even
though he played only 6Vz min
utes.

Willy Brown, USC sophomore
speedster, is also supposed to be
unable to face Stanford because
of injuries. Curtice told the
sportswriters that, after his ex
perience with Renfro’s “injury,”
he would practice all week to
stack Stanford’s defenses against
Biown.


PURSUIT, the hallmark of a good defense, has been exhibited by
Stanford all year. Stanford's linebacker John Butler (69) and de
fensive halfback Gary Craig (40) are shown surrounding Oregon
wingback Ben Brown (24) and holding him to a short gain.
