### PETE KING 
In a great exhibition of team
running. Stanford’s cross country
men yesterday soundly defeated
San Francisco State, 23-39, on the
Stanford golf course. Only 23 sec
onds reparated the first five Card
runners.
Bill Morgan from San Francis
co State won the race with an ex
cellent time of 20:37.7 for the 4,2
miles. The Indians had much
more depth, however, taking sec
ond, third, fifth, sixth, seventh
and eighth places.
Freshman Weym Kirkland, for
the second meet in a row, was the
first Card runner over the finish
line. His second place time of
21:06.5 was closely followed by
the 21:08.6 clocking of Dave
Stinebeck, also a freshman.
Craig Spilman, the only other

SFS man to finish in the top
eight, finished fourth. Then came
two more Indian freshmen; Paul
Schlicke had a time of 21:18.2 for
fifth slot, and one second behind
him was Harlan Andrews. Senior
Rich Klier took seventh and soph
omore Bill Pratt eighth.
Indian coach Payton Jordan ex
pressed enthusiasm with the team
running and singled out Kirkland
and Stineback as outstanding.
“This was encouraging team ef
fort,” said Jordan. “It was a real
ly good effort off of our defeat by
San Jose last Friday. Kirkland

| ran well, and Stinebeck turned In
I one of his best races yet.”
Corning up this Saturday will
} be a big meet for the team at Los
| Angeles against always-tough
i UCLA and USC. Stanford has al
ready beaten both teams in earli
er meets. UCLA was topped, 35-
58, and the Indians trounced USC
by a 58-83 margin. Jordan re
marked that it was difficult to
make predictions, but that more
improvement such as was shown
! by the team against San Francis
co State should make Stanford
; the favorite.
