# Stu-Fac Board Renews SU Custom: At Homes
## 
### 
Under the sponsorship of the
Student-Faculty Board, faculty
“At Homes” will begin tonight at
Stanford. For an “At Home” a
faculty member opens his home
for an evening to any students
who would like to drop by. Con
versation will be informal; guests
may stay 15 minutes or the en
tire (7-10 p.m. I evening.
Professors who are opening
their homes on a particular eve
ning will be indicated in The
Daily under the “At Home” head
ing to be listed regularly on the
back page. Tonight’s function is
_at the home of Prof. Sanford M.
Dornbush, 841 Pine Hill Road.
“AT HOMES” ARE an attempt
to implement the Student-Faculty
Board goal of furthering student
faculty relations at an academic
level in a non-classroom atmos
phere. The “At Home” is a new
area of Stu-Fac work in addition
to Faculty Firesides, Hostels, fac
ulty associates and residents.
The “at home” offers complete
informality in that no intermedi
ary body is planning a program.
Professors are to feel free to call
The Daily and insert their name
in the “At Home” list as often as
they wish.
Students are encouraged to ask
a professor if he would like to be
“at home” to students. The pro
gram puts no pressure upon the
already crammed schedule of the
faculty member. He is not expect
ed to lead formal discussion, is
not being bothered with sign-ups,
does not have to waste time wait
ing for something to begin.
THE IDEA FOR the At Home
program was motivated by an
item in an 1897 edition of The
Daily. In the old version of Once
Around (he Quad were small no
tices: Professor and Mrs. Jones
at home to students tonight.
The idea apparently faded as
the days of David Stair Jordan
passed and the Farm grew into
a hustling University community.

Any student or faculty member
who has questions about the pro
gram should contact Bill Loitz at
the ASSU office.
