WASHINGTON (UPI) Presi
dent Kennedy and Indian Prime
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
opened a round of talks on world
issues yesterday with a four-hour
discussion of Southeast Asia
where Communist guerrillas have
been stepping up their attacks.

The White House said the two
leaders one representing the
West and the other uncommitted
nations—took up such areas as
South Viet Nam and Laos. Those
countries are considered to be un
der the greatest threat of Com
munist aggression.
WHILE the conferences were
underway, the State Department
accused Russia of airlifting arms
to aCommunist military base in
Southeastern Laos, the main
springboard of the North Viet
namese undercover invasion of
South Viet Nam.
White House Press Secretary
Pierre Salinger said that during
the day Nehru discussed with the
President a talk he had in New
Delhi last week with Ambassador
Averell Harriman, chief U.S. ne
gotiator at the Geneva conference

on Laos.
Salinger added that there was

“a discussion of the problems of
South Viet Nam and Laos,” but
declined to describe the atmos
phere of the talks.

ALSO ON the Kennedy-Nehru
agenda are such issues in dispute
as admission of Red China to the
United Nations and the resump
tion of nuclear weapons tests.
Other subjects expected to get
attention during further talks to
day and tomorrow were the Ber
lin crisis, India’s dispute with
Pakistan over Kashmir, and
United Nations operations in the
Congo.

THE IDEA behind the Kenne
dy-Nehru conferences is to
achieve a better understanding
of the occasional differences be
tween the United States and India
on certain world issues.

For one thing, the President
hopes to win a more sympathetic
attitude by Nehru toward U.S.
refusal to support India’s U.N.
proposal for another nuclear test
moratorium without inspection or
controls.
