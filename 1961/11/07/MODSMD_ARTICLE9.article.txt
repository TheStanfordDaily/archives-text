13.
A dozen West Berlin policemen,
aided by favorable winds, beat
back some 200 Communist police
supported by armored personnel
carrier and water cannon in the
border tear gas battle.
THE COMMUNIST police force
had rushed to the border in an at
tempt to keep Western police
from dismantling the stretch of

der.
Shortly afterward, Communist
police fired at two youths fleeing

tured one of them, West Berlin
police reported.
Western police said a 24-year
old East German was struck in
the legs by sub-machine gun bul
lets and fell into a barbed-wire
entanglement. The Communist
police dragged him back into
Eastern territory while his friend,
aged 22, crept safely through to
the French sector of Berlin.
THE INCIDENT occurred in a
rain-storm just after dark on an
unlighted section of the border
between East Germany and the
French sector district of Frohnau
in Berlin.
The Communists also opened
fire against refugees yesterday
at two other points on the border,
but no casualties were reported in
the earlier incidents.
Two of the fleeing East Ger
mans were captured at gunpoint
after the Communist guards fired
at them.

WEST BERLIN police said at
least 27 persons were caught at
tempting to flee but that at least
18 East Germans made it safely
to West Berlin.

The tear gas border duel lasted
an hour and a half. The Commu
nist border policemen were
backed by four armored person
nel carrier and two armored
water cannon sent to the border
in an effort to block the dismantl-

mg.
The Communists threw 30 tear
gas grenades with explosive
charges at the 12 West Berlin po
lice and six workmen they wei’e
protecting. But only about one
fourth of the Red grenades went
off and the wind blew the tear gas
back at the Communists.

The Western police threw 60
tear gas grenades in the course of
the fray and managed to provide
cover for the workers as they
pulled down the fence built in the
Wilhelmsrude railway yard.
