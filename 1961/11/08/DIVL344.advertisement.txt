Cats are notoriously silent in their singularly feline way, But even the
most stealthily treading tomcat could take lessons from the men at
Ford Motor Company whose job it is to track down and suppress
unwanted noise in vehicles.
At our Ford Research and Engineering Center in Dearborn, engineers
have created a unique room without echoes, virtually duplicating the
perfect stillness that exists miles above the earth’s surface.
The "Silent Room", as we call it, is a chamber utilizing fiber-glass
wedges as sonic "blotters" to soak up noise emanating from subjects
undergoing developmental tests, In this acoustically sterile environ
ment, electronic instruments seek out the source of vibrations,
rattles, rumbles and squeaks so that they can be eliminated in
production.
This scientific approach to silence is but a tiny facet of the many
sided program of pure and applied research which goes on daily at
Ford Motor Company. It is another example of Ford’s leadership
through scientific research and engineering.
