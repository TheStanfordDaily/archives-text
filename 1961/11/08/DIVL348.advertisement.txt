POVERTY CAN BE FUN
It is no disgrace to lx? poor. It is an error, but it is no disgrace.
So if your purse is empty, do not skulk and brood and bide
your head in shame. Stand tall. Admit your poverty. Admit it
freely and frankly and all kinds of good things will happen to
you. Take, for instance, the case of Blossom Sigafoos.
Blossom, an impecunious freshman at an Eastern girls’
college, was smart as a whip and round as a dumpling, and
scarcely a day went by when she didn’t get invited to a party
weekend at one of the nearby men's schools. But Blossom never
accepted. She did not have the rail fare; she did not have the
clothes. Weekend after weekend, while her classmates went
frolicking, Blossom sat alone, saved from utter despair only
by her pack of Marlboros, for even an exchequer as slim as
Blossom’s can afford the joys of Marlboro—joys far beyond
their paltry price: rich, mellow tobaccos, lovingly cured and
carefully packed, and an exclusive selectrate filter. Croesus
himself could not buy a better cigarette!
However, Marlboro’s most passionate admirers —among
whose number I am paid to count myself—would not claim that
Marlboro can entirely replace love and romance, and Blossom
grew steadily moroser.

Then one day came a phone call from an intelligent sopho
more named Tom O’Shanter at a nearby men’s college. “Blos
som,” said Tom, “I want you to come down next week for the
barley festival, and I won’t take no for an answer.”
“No,” said Blossom.
“Foolish girl,” said Tom gently. “I know why you refuse
me. It is because you are poor, isn’t it?”
“Yes,” said Blossom.
“I will send you a railroad ticket,” said Tom. “Also a hard
boiled egg in case you get hungry on the train.”
“But I have nothing to wear,” said Blossom.
Tom replied, “I will send you one suit of cashmere, two gowns
of lace, three slacks of velvet, four shoes of calf, five socks of
nylon, and a partridge in a pear tree.”
“That is most kind,” said Blossom, “but I fear I cannot
dance and enjoy myself while back home my poor lame brother
Tiny Tim lies abed.”
“Send him to Mayo Brothers and put it on my tab,” said Tom.
“You are terribly decent,” said Blossom, “but I cannot
come to your party because all the other girls at the party
will l>e from rich, distinguished families, and my father is but
a humble woodcutter.”
“I will buy him Yosemite,” said Tom.
“You have a great heart,” said Blossom. “Hold the phone
while I ask our wise and kindly old Dean of Women whether it
is proper for me to accept all those gifts,”
She went forthwith and asked the Dean of Women, and the
Dean of Women laid her wise and kindly old hand on Blossom’s
cheek and said, “Child, let not false pride rob you of happiness.
Accept these gifts from Tom.”
“Oh. bless you, Wise and Kindly,” breathed Blossom,
dropping grateful tears into the Dean’s reticule. “I must run
and tell Tom.”
“Yes, run, child,” said the Dean, a smile wrinkling her wise
and kindly old eyes. “And ask him has he got an older brother.”

“That is most kind,” said Blossom, “but I fear I cannot
dance and enjoy myself while back home my poor lame brother
Tiny Tim lies abed.”
“Send him to Mayo Brothers and put it on my tab,” said Tom.
“You are terribly decent,” said Blossom, “but I cannot
come to your party because all the other girls at the party
will l>e from rich, distinguished families, and my father is but
a humble woodcutter.”
“I will buy him Yosemite,” said Tom.
“You have a great heart,” said Blossom. “Hold the phone
while I ask our wise and kindly old Dean of Women whether it
is proper for me to accept all those gifts,”
She went forthwith and asked the Dean of Women, and the
Dean of Women laid her wise and kindly old hand on Blossom’s
cheek and said, “Child, let not false pride rob you of happiness.
Accept these gifts from Tom.”
“Oh. bless you, Wise and Kindly,” breathed Blossom,
dropping grateful tears into the Dean’s reticule. “I must run
and tell Tom.”
“Yes, run, child,” said the Dean, a smile wrinkling her wise
and kindly old eyes. “And ask him has he got an older brother.”

POVERTY CAN BE FUN
It is no disgrace to lx? poor. It is an error, but it is no disgrace.
So if your purse is empty, do not skulk and brood and bide
your head in shame. Stand tall. Admit your poverty. Admit it
freely and frankly and all kinds of good things will happen to
you. Take, for instance, the case of Blossom Sigafoos.
Blossom, an impecunious freshman at an Eastern girls’
college, was smart as a whip and round as a dumpling, and
scarcely a day went by when she didn’t get invited to a party
weekend at one of the nearby men's schools. But Blossom never
accepted. She did not have the rail fare; she did not have the
clothes. Weekend after weekend, while her classmates went
frolicking, Blossom sat alone, saved from utter despair only
by her pack of Marlboros, for even an exchequer as slim as
Blossom’s can afford the joys of Marlboro—joys far beyond
their paltry price: rich, mellow tobaccos, lovingly cured and
carefully packed, and an exclusive selectrate filter. Croesus
himself could not buy a better cigarette!
However, Marlboro’s most passionate admirers —among
whose number I am paid to count myself—would not claim that
Marlboro can entirely replace love and romance, and Blossom
grew steadily moroser.

Then one day came a phone call from an intelligent sopho
more named Tom O’Shanter at a nearby men’s college. “Blos
som,” said Tom, “I want you to come down next week for the
barley festival, and I won’t take no for an answer.”
“No,” said Blossom.
“Foolish girl,” said Tom gently. “I know why you refuse
me. It is because you are poor, isn’t it?”
“Yes,” said Blossom.
“I will send you a railroad ticket,” said Tom. “Also a hard
boiled egg in case you get hungry on the train.”
“But I have nothing to wear,” said Blossom.
Tom replied, “I will send you one suit of cashmere, two gowns
of lace, three slacks of velvet, four shoes of calf, five socks of
nylon, and a partridge in a pear tree.”
“That is most kind,” said Blossom, “but I fear I cannot
dance and enjoy myself while back home my poor lame brother
Tiny Tim lies abed.”
“Send him to Mayo Brothers and put it on my tab,” said Tom.
