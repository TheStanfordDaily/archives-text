# STANFORD PLAYERS
## Production Combines Film, Acting 
### 
A film integrated with the act
ing and the first use of new car
bon-arc lights are features of “The
Marriage of Mr. Mississippi,” to
be given tomorrow, Friday and
Saturday by the Stanford Players.
The three-act comic-satire by
Swiss avant-garde playwright
Friedrich Duerrenmatt, will open
the Players’ subscription series in
Memorial Auditorium.
THE BLENDING of cinema and
live theatre technique will high
light the unique staging of the
play, as Director Juris Svendsen
will combine five movie sequences
with the stage production.
Film director Raoul Peizer has
written movie script designed to
extend and intensify the meaning,
form and content of the contem
porary play. The sequences were
filmed on location in the hills of
Palo Alto.
Two carbon-arc follow spots, a
$2,500 gift donated by Ram’s Head
to Memorial Auditorium, will be
used for the first time in the par
ody of present morals and politics.
A SPECIAL tilted (raked) stage
will be used for the presentation.
The play treats the lives of four
men with ideals involved with the
power of a woman who is both
their success and their destruc
tion. The men represent foolish
idealism, practical expediency,
communism, and Mosaic consera
tism.
The setting of Vanessa’s apart
ment is designed with a movable
panel in front that will act as a
curtain for the play and a movie
screen for the film portions.
VANESSA, a woman who draws
about her world revolutionaries,
religious fanatics and men of po
litical expediency, will be played
by Barbara Greer. She is a French
Literature major, professional
dancer, and choreographer for the
Ram’s Head Gaieties. Miss Greer
also played the leading role of
Madeleine in Eugene lonesco’s
“Victims of Duty” at Stanford this
past summer.
The cast also includes Mr. Mis
sissippi, John Kulsar; St. Claude,
Victor Emeljanow; Diego, Philip
Ellis; Count Uebelohe, Luke
Vania.

The play treats the lives of four

ment is designed with a movable
panel in front that will act as a
curtain for the play and a movie
screen for the film portions.

litical expediency, will be played
by Barbara Greer. She is a French
