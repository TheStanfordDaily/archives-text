# 'At Home' Program Rare Opportunity
## 
### 
Student-Faculty Board has revived a program begun before the
turn of the century in a move which should appeal to students and
faculty with a desire to know one another better.
This is the “At Home” program, whereby professors open their
homes one night a week for two or three hours and invite any and
all interested students to visit them for informal conversation and
refreshments. The topic of talk can, and undoubtedly will, range
from abstract philosophical questions to the fortunes of the Indian
football team.
Announcements of the various “At Homes” will appear in The
Daily from day to day on the last page, with the name of the pro
fessor, his department, his address and the hours his home will be
open.
We hope the idea receives the hearty support of both students
and faculty. A main complaint we have heard about Stanford from
both students ami faculty is that they do not get together outside
of class as much as they would like. Here is a program designed to
take the student into the professor’s home—at the explicit request of
the professor—for informal conversation. Its value is incalcuable to
both the student and the professor.
Many professors are willing to participate in the program. We
have heard from the students that they, too, are eager for such a
device to meet and know their instructors.
The Stu-Fac “At Home” program offers a rare chance to satisfy
that mutual desire.
