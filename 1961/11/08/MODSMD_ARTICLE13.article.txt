## Smith College Reacts To Margery's Mistake

graduated with the desire to “Go
Forth and Do Good.”
THE YOUNG lady joined the
Friendship Flock and went to Pov
ertania where she met the King
and the Secretary of State. Finally
she got to the villages and rice
fields to help the common people.
“She was ecstatic. She was help
ing people at last. In fact she was
so busy helping people that she
didn’t have time to write home.”
After a few months, her mother
wrote, demanding to know how
her daughter was, “as mothers
will” “And so the girl took a mo
ment off from mixing cement and
scribhled on the back of a post
card, ‘Having a wonderful time.
People poor, but kind and friendly.
Am eating well, and remembering
to wear my rubbers. Caught cold,
but a shot of penicillin fixed me up
fine.’ ”
THE POSTCARD fell into the
“Wrong Hands.”
Povertania protested, “She
thinks we’re squalid, obsequious,
disease ridden! The witch doctor
ain’t good enough for her ... peni
cillin she needs!”
The girl was sent home, went to
work in an insurance office and
never did anything nice for any
body again.
The second commentary was re
printed from the Wall Street Jour
nal (Oct. 23). It is a letter written
home by a Peace Corps worker in
“Lower Insomnia.”
The letter attempts to minimize
the problems daughter finds in her
new job:
• • ARTS and crafts are a little
different here. For instance they
had these shrunken . . . er, what I
mean is some of the things would
make interesting conversation
pieces. . . .”
“. . . in Lower Insomnia they do
not cook in the streets. These peo
ple prefer to eat their food raw—
undoubtedly they realize how
cooking destroys valuable vita
mins and minerals.”
“... just imagine little me teach
ing .. . how to turn miles of track
less jungles into rolling fields of
wheat, corn and grain.”
Smithies seem to feel their col
lege and its educational policies
were in no way at fault for Miss
Michelmore’s error. The mistake,
they say, was hers alone. They
seem to blame most of the prob
lem, however, on the “Wrong
Hands.”

Margery Michelmore, of Peace
Corps infamy, is a graduate of
Smith College (Northampton,
Mass.). Are you at all curious
about how the 2,300 undergrad
girls reacted to “The Incident”?
In an editorial labeled “Unfair
Criticism,” the college paper says,
“Miss Michelmore's postcard rep
resents the mistake of an individu
al—not the crime of an entire sys
tem of education, or the evidence
of a dumb idea.”
Elsewhere in the editorial, the
paper says, “The Peace Corps is
not something one can easily dis
miss in a few enlightened para
graphs of praise or condemnation.
Neither are the values of Smith
College.
“BOTH PEACE CORPS and
Smith are built on certain under
lying principles and beliefs. Both
are worthy of infinitely more
thought than a few flippant
phrases and catchy remarks de
signed to catch the readers’ eye.”
In particular, the editorial at
tacks statements made by Doro
thy Kilgallen which implied to the
Smithites that “the qualities and
standards of Smith College fluc
tuate from day to day because of
the actions of her alumnae.”
A key paragraph in the editorial
shows that Smith girls feel they
have been unfairly criticised be
cause of their college affiliation
with Miss Michelmore:
“NOR DOES a single postcard
warrant condemnation not only of
a young girl but also of two entire
institutions Peace Corps and
Smith College.”
The Smith paper published two
long articles commenting on The
Incident. The first, a staff-written
fable entitled, “The Tale of the
Dove of Peace and the Asses, or,
Why the World Got Sore at the
Corps,” tells this story:
There once was a little girl who
liked to help people. She grew up,
“ascended the Great Ivory Tower
in Northampton” and learned she
had an obligation to society. She
