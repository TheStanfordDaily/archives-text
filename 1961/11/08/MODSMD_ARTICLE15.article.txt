# CAMPUS OPINION
## Honor Code Review Needed 
### CARL MITCHAM 
In a recent letter to The Daily,
Miss Sharon Cobb touched on a
problem which I would like to con
tinue to explore.
When I first applied for admis
sion to Stanford University, I was
asked if I would abide by the Hon
or Code. A definition of that Code
was not included with the request,
so I assumed that this was some
thing to be interpreted by each in
dividual as he saw fit.
I thought this a good aproach
and therefore signed, indicating
that I would agree to abide by the
Honor Code. It was not until after
being accepted by Stanford that
the Honor Code was defined for
me.
ON THE FRONT of each exam
book there is a statement which
says that recognition of the spirit
of the Honor Code requires that “I
certify that I will neither receive
nor give unpermitted aid on this
examination and that I will report,
to the best of my ability, all Honor
Code violations observed by me.”
I cannot concur with this inter
pretation of an honor code, and I
can only consider my signature of
agreement on the original Stan
ford application as invalid. This is
public notice to that effect.
In the course of my first quarter
at Stanford I have taken two ex
ams. I felt it necessary in both
cases to cross out “and I will re
port, to the best of my ability, all
Honor Code violations observed by
me” before signing the Honor
Code statement.
NOW, JUST what are my objec
tions to the second half of the
Code? This is a hard thing to talk
about. I do not believe that the
watchdog idea is a good one, be it
administered by students or fac
ulty.
And this type of code is simply
transfering the proctor’s work to
the student. It seems to me that if
one is going to eliminate a proctor,
then one ought to genuinely elimi
nate him and give responsibility to
the student for his own actions,
not to both the student and his
peer-group.

The next objection is a little
more subtle, but still relevant. I
dislike the production that is made

of the Honor Code. A true Honor
Code does not need propaganda to
support it.
I PREVIOUSLY attended the
University of Colorado. There was
no Honor Code at that school, but
instructors did not always remain
in the classroom during an exam.

When an instructor did leave,
he did not feel obligated to caution
the students to sign a pledge say
ing that they did not cheat. To
make a fetish of leaving the class
room, as some instructors seem to
do by remaining right outside the

door during the hour, appears to
me to be absurd.

I do not mean to completely con
demn the Stanford Honor Code; as
I said, I signed the first part of it.
However, I do feel that there needs
to be a little more thinking about
this thing, and a little less worship.
This, then, is written in the hope
that some constructive action can
be taken: say, the formation of a
committee to re-evaluate the pres
ent Honor Code and recommend
changes. This is an immediate
need.
