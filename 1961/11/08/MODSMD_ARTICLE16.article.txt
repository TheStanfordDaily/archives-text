INHUMANITY
Editor, The Daily:
Stanford has long been noted as
a school of engineers and business
men, and it must be expected that
this element will advocate actions
and dispositions of the objective,
dead, inhuman mind.
However, to see this campus sac
rificed to inhumanity in the man
ner which has become only too ob
vious this quarter is too much to
bear.
The inability to understand or
to feel empathy is all too charac
teristic of the immature mind, but
the inability to love and the con
verse ability to manifest a pure
form of hate in mob actions speaks
only of a sterile, inhuman mind.
It is just this sort of inhumanity
which wo see in our reaction to
“Sons and Lovers” (at the Sunday
Flicks) and in our desire to blow
bombs off in the Arctic Circle to
exterminate the ENEMY. Soph
ists may tell us that those who
cringe and beg for mercy beneath
this weight of “objectivism” are
without faith in God, but it is these
very sophists themselves who
have no faith or belief in the only
real progeny of God—man.
Perhaps we "need” the Birch
Society, perhaps we “need” Ayn
Rand, perhaps wo “need” blind
faith in objectivity and death
they in their way give us security
and happiness in that they tell us
what we want to hear.
But, is the human condition
driven under the whip of happi
ness to such an extent that it is
incapable of realizing its own hu
manity? Can happiness in any
form arise from fear and hate?
It seems the dead, objective mind
tells us so—has this type of mind
really crushed us to such an ex
tent that we are no longer capable
of calling ourselves human?

WESSELL COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
... It is possible that many peo
ple, including Nick Wessell, were
offended by Stanford students at
the last football game; but anyone
so offended is guilty of symbolic
naivete. No symbol is bad, dirty,
or nasty, and no symbol should
provoke offense.
Let X mean feces, or perhaps
let it imply reproduction; the ab
surdity in taking offense at hear

ing the symbol “X” spoken aloud
is readily apparent. Its usage
should not displease parents or
even alumni.
But substitute four-letter words
for X and all the people with sym
bolic naivete take forthright of
fense and call Stanford students
immature.
. . . The equivalents of X are, in
fact, vocalized more or less often
in the rooters’ section, and do give
obvious pleasure to the authors.
There is no nastiness in this be
cause a symbol cannot be nasty,
nor can its usage.
The only cause for offense ex
ists entirely in the minds of those
offended. It exists either as filth in
their minds, or as naivete, or as im
maturity.
However, perhaps what Nick
Wessell meant to say was that
Stanford might become disinherit
ed as a result of the students' in
considerate symbolic representa
tion, and so we should desist for
the sake of the school.
This might present a real objec
tion if dealt with honestly, but is
an absurdiity when disguised; and
in either case it is not a legitimate
objection to the symbols in them
selves whether verbal or manual
symbols.
In summary, a symbol cannot be
bad. and should not provoke of
fense. Any problem of disinherit
ance should be discussed in an
honest, clear, fashion without
throwing mud on Stanford stu
dents. And anyone offended by the
use of certain “obscene” symbols
is certainly naive and . . . imma
ture.
