## U.S. Economic Policy 
### 
In a statement issued jointly
by Mr. Christian Holder and Mr.
Will Clayton, and published as a
Congressional document by Rep.
Hale Boggs’s Committee, they say
that “the time has come for the
United States to take a giant
step.’’ The giant step is in the
field of tariffs and trade policy,
and the direction of the giant
step is towards a much closer
trading relationship with the non-
Communist world.

The purpose of the step is to in
crease greatly the prosperity of
the non-Communist world. The
significance of the step is that it
will draw together the non-Com
munist world into a union quite
capable of confronting the Com
munist orbit confidently, of com
peting with it effectively, and of
co-existing with it securely.

It is a grandiose undertaking.
But it is not a vision in the air.
The Atlantic Community has ex
isted as an historic fact since the
Spanish and the Portugese, the
French, the British, the Dutch
and the Swedes, colonized North
and South America some three
centuries ago.
THAT THERE HAS always
been an Atlantic Community
since then is attested by our own
history. Beginning with colonial
times there has been no great war
in Europe in which Americans
have not become engaged. What
is called American isolationism
was possible only in the 100 year’s
between the battle of Waterloo
and the battle of the Marne—that
is to say in that unique century
when there was no world war.

The experience of the Second
World War has taught the Ameri
can people that it would be an il
lusion to think that they can re
turn to the isolation of the nine
teenth century. Now our people
are beginning to learn that econ
omic isolation, in the sense that
we can regard our trade policy as
a domestic issue, is not only un
workable but undesirable.
It has become unworkable with
the decision of Great Britain to
join the Common Market, a de
cision that may be one of the
most momentous in modern Eu
ropean history. It has become un
desirable to adhere to our tradi
tional tariff policy, because we
cannot afford to miss the oppor
tunity to participate in a move
ment which will lift the non-Com
munist world out of the dol
drums.

THESE ABE BIG words, and
they might well be so much hot
air if it were not that there is al
ready under way negotiation of
(he terms of the new trading com
munity. We shall not come direct
ly into those negotiations until
Britain, having taken care of the
vital interests of the Common
wealth, has been accepted as a
member of the Common Market.
More or less simultaneously
there will come into it also, with
certain reservations, Switzerland,
Austria, and the Scandinavian
countries.

When this has been accomplish
ed, we shall have to be ready to
take what Messrs. Herter and
Clayton call the giant step. The
enlarged Common Market will
contain over 300,000,000 people
working and living in what will
very soon be a free trade area. It
will be a larger free trade area
than the internal market of the
United States, and participating
in this market will be the most
advanced industrial countries in
the world.

There can be no doubt that in
such a big market European in
dustry will advance spectacularly.
As Under-Secretary of State for
Economic Affairs George Ball
pointed out to the Foreign Trade
Convention, the industrial lead
ers of Western Europe “are lay
ing plans for expansion, for addi
tional specialization and market
penetration on a scale that has no
precedents in European history.”
THIS WILL confront us with
the question of whether we
should seal ourselves up in our
own market or move to open up
access for our exports to the
much larger European markets.
If we choose to open up the ac
cess, we shall not obtain it as a
favor or because Europe is grate
ful to us, or even because Europe
depends upon us to save it from
the military power of the Soviet
Union. We shall be able to open
up the European market to
American business only if in re
turn we open up the American
market to European business.
There is general agreement
among those who are studying
and deliberating on the formation
of our own policy. They agree
that our relations with the en
larged Common Market cannot be
worked out item by item, as un
der the existing tariff legislation.
The only way our radically new
relationship can be worked out is
in effect to authorize the Presi
dent to negotiate an economic ar
rangement with the Common

Market providing for a broad re
ciprocal reduction of tariff walls.

AGREEING ON this much,
there is some difference of opin
ion about the political tactics that
the President should adopt. Some
think that he should go to Con
gress during the coming session
and ask for new legislation to re
place the old legislation which
expires in June. Others think that
he should declare and explain the
new policy to this session of Con
gress, but that he should post
pone specific legislation until
1963.

The argument of the first group
is that letting the existing legis
lation expire without substituting
any in its place would give the
impression of a retreat from the
policy of liberalizing trade. Press
ing trade policy issues will arise
before the new Common Market
comes into being which require
that the President possess suffi
cient authority to deal with them.
The argument of the second
group is that so great a change
in our traditional tariff policy,
this “giant step,” requires a
longer period of education and
public debate than we have yet
had.

Dropping such legislation into a
Congress which is preoccupied
with an election would almost cer
tainly mean a scrimmage of speci
al interests and a debate at a
much lower level than the sub
ject requires.
THEY feel satisfied that noth
ing will be lost by the longer
period of preparation and incu
bation, and that the Congress will
have a better realization of the
weight of the issue when the en
larged Common Market is in fact
a going concern.

Their reasoning seems to be
sound. It is sound provided that
the President will expound the
new policy with the emphasis
and the attention which its his
toric significance calls for.

In a statement issued jointly
by Mr. Christian Holder and Mr.
Will Clayton, and published as a
Congressional document by Rep.
Hale Boggs’s Committee, they say
that “the time has come for the
United States to take a giant
step.’’ The giant step is in the
field of tariffs and trade policy,
and the direction of the giant
step is towards a much closer
trading relationship with the non-
Communist world.

The purpose of the step is to in
crease greatly the prosperity of
the non-Communist world. The
significance of the step is that it
will draw together the non-Com
munist world into a union quite
capable of confronting the Com
munist orbit confidently, of com
peting with it effectively, and of
co-existing with it securely.

It is a grandiose undertaking.
But it is not a vision in the air.
The Atlantic Community has ex
isted as an historic fact since the
Spanish and the Portugese, the
French, the British, the Dutch
and the Swedes, colonized North
and South America some three
centuries ago.
THAT THERE HAS always
been an Atlantic Community
since then is attested by our own
history. Beginning with colonial
times there has been no great war
in Europe in which Americans
have not become engaged. What
is called American isolationism
was possible only in the 100 year’s
between the battle of Waterloo
and the battle of the Marne—that
is to say in that unique century
when there was no world war.

The experience of the Second
World War has taught the Ameri
can people that it would be an il
lusion to think that they can re
turn to the isolation of the nine
teenth century. Now our people
are beginning to learn that econ
omic isolation, in the sense that
we can regard our trade policy as
a domestic issue, is not only un
workable but undesirable.
It has become unworkable with
the decision of Great Britain to
join the Common Market, a de
cision that may be one of the
most momentous in modern Eu
ropean history. It has become un
desirable to adhere to our tradi
tional tariff policy, because we
cannot afford to miss the oppor
tunity to participate in a move
ment which will lift the non-Com
munist world out of the dol
drums.

THESE ABE BIG words, and
they might well be so much hot
air if it were not that there is al
ready under way negotiation of
(he terms of the new trading com
munity. We shall not come direct
ly into those negotiations until
Britain, having taken care of the
vital interests of the Common
wealth, has been accepted as a
member of the Common Market.
More or less simultaneously
there will come into it also, with
certain reservations, Switzerland,
Austria, and the Scandinavian
countries.

When this has been accomplish
ed, we shall have to be ready to
take what Messrs. Herter and
Clayton call the giant step. The
enlarged Common Market will
contain over 300,000,000 people
working and living in what will
very soon be a free trade area. It
will be a larger free trade area
than the internal market of the
United States, and participating
in this market will be the most
advanced industrial countries in
the world.

There can be no doubt that in
such a big market European in
dustry will advance spectacularly.
As Under-Secretary of State for
Economic Affairs George Ball
pointed out to the Foreign Trade
Convention, the industrial lead
ers of Western Europe “are lay
ing plans for expansion, for addi
tional specialization and market
penetration on a scale that has no
precedents in European history.”
THIS WILL confront us with
the question of whether we
should seal ourselves up in our
own market or move to open up
access for our exports to the
much larger European markets.
If we choose to open up the ac
cess, we shall not obtain it as a
favor or because Europe is grate
ful to us, or even because Europe
depends upon us to save it from
the military power of the Soviet
Union. We shall be able to open
up the European market to
American business only if in re
turn we open up the American
market to European business.
There is general agreement
among those who are studying
and deliberating on the formation
of our own policy. They agree
that our relations with the en
larged Common Market cannot be
worked out item by item, as un
der the existing tariff legislation.
The only way our radically new
relationship can be worked out is
in effect to authorize the Presi
dent to negotiate an economic ar
rangement with the Common

Market providing for a broad re
ciprocal reduction of tariff walls.

AGREEING ON this much,
there is some difference of opin
ion about the political tactics that
the President should adopt. Some
think that he should go to Con
gress during the coming session
and ask for new legislation to re
place the old legislation which
expires in June. Others think that
he should declare and explain the
new policy to this session of Con
gress, but that he should post
pone specific legislation until
1963.

The argument of the first group
is that letting the existing legis
lation expire without substituting
any in its place would give the
impression of a retreat from the
policy of liberalizing trade. Press
ing trade policy issues will arise
before the new Common Market
comes into being which require
that the President possess suffi
cient authority to deal with them.
The argument of the second
group is that so great a change
in our traditional tariff policy,
this “giant step,” requires a
longer period of education and
public debate than we have yet
had.

Dropping such legislation into a
Congress which is preoccupied
with an election would almost cer
tainly mean a scrimmage of speci
al interests and a debate at a
much lower level than the sub
ject requires.
THEY feel satisfied that noth
ing will be lost by the longer
period of preparation and incu
bation, and that the Congress will
have a better realization of the
weight of the issue when the en
larged Common Market is in fact
a going concern.

Their reasoning seems to be
sound. It is sound provided that
the President will expound the
new policy with the emphasis
and the attention which its his
toric significance calls for.

In a statement issued jointly
by Mr. Christian Holder and Mr.
Will Clayton, and published as a
Congressional document by Rep.
Hale Boggs’s Committee, they say
that “the time has come for the
United States to take a giant
step.’’ The giant step is in the
field of tariffs and trade policy,
and the direction of the giant
step is towards a much closer
trading relationship with the non-
Communist world.

The purpose of the step is to in
crease greatly the prosperity of
the non-Communist world. The
significance of the step is that it
will draw together the non-Com
munist world into a union quite
capable of confronting the Com
munist orbit confidently, of com
peting with it effectively, and of
co-existing with it securely.

It is a grandiose undertaking.
But it is not a vision in the air.
The Atlantic Community has ex
isted as an historic fact since the
Spanish and the Portugese, the
French, the British, the Dutch
and the Swedes, colonized North
and South America some three
centuries ago.
THAT THERE HAS always
been an Atlantic Community
since then is attested by our own
history. Beginning with colonial
times there has been no great war
in Europe in which Americans
have not become engaged. What
is called American isolationism
was possible only in the 100 year’s
between the battle of Waterloo
and the battle of the Marne—that
is to say in that unique century
when there was no world war.

The experience of the Second
World War has taught the Ameri
can people that it would be an il
lusion to think that they can re
turn to the isolation of the nine
teenth century. Now our people
are beginning to learn that econ
omic isolation, in the sense that
we can regard our trade policy as
a domestic issue, is not only un
workable but undesirable.
It has become unworkable with
the decision of Great Britain to
join the Common Market, a de
cision that may be one of the
most momentous in modern Eu
ropean history. It has become un
desirable to adhere to our tradi
tional tariff policy, because we
cannot afford to miss the oppor
tunity to participate in a move
ment which will lift the non-Com
munist world out of the dol
drums.

THESE ABE BIG words, and
they might well be so much hot
air if it were not that there is al
ready under way negotiation of
(he terms of the new trading com
munity. We shall not come direct
ly into those negotiations until
Britain, having taken care of the
vital interests of the Common
wealth, has been accepted as a
member of the Common Market.
More or less simultaneously
there will come into it also, with
certain reservations, Switzerland,
Austria, and the Scandinavian
countries.

When this has been accomplish
ed, we shall have to be ready to
take what Messrs. Herter and
Clayton call the giant step. The
enlarged Common Market will
contain over 300,000,000 people
working and living in what will
very soon be a free trade area. It
will be a larger free trade area
than the internal market of the
United States, and participating
in this market will be the most
advanced industrial countries in
the world.

There can be no doubt that in
such a big market European in
dustry will advance spectacularly.
As Under-Secretary of State for
Economic Affairs George Ball
pointed out to the Foreign Trade
Convention, the industrial lead
ers of Western Europe “are lay
ing plans for expansion, for addi
tional specialization and market
penetration on a scale that has no
precedents in European history.”
THIS WILL confront us with
the question of whether we
should seal ourselves up in our
own market or move to open up
access for our exports to the
much larger European markets.
If we choose to open up the ac
cess, we shall not obtain it as a
favor or because Europe is grate
ful to us, or even because Europe
depends upon us to save it from
the military power of the Soviet
Union. We shall be able to open
up the European market to
American business only if in re
turn we open up the American
market to European business.
There is general agreement
among those who are studying
and deliberating on the formation
of our own policy. They agree
that our relations with the en
larged Common Market cannot be
worked out item by item, as un
der the existing tariff legislation.
The only way our radically new
relationship can be worked out is
in effect to authorize the Presi
dent to negotiate an economic ar
rangement with the Common

Market providing for a broad re
ciprocal reduction of tariff walls.

AGREEING ON this much,
there is some difference of opin
ion about the political tactics that
the President should adopt. Some
think that he should go to Con
gress during the coming session
and ask for new legislation to re
place the old legislation which
expires in June. Others think that
he should declare and explain the
new policy to this session of Con
gress, but that he should post
pone specific legislation until
1963.

The argument of the first group
is that letting the existing legis
lation expire without substituting
any in its place would give the
impression of a retreat from the
policy of liberalizing trade. Press
ing trade policy issues will arise
before the new Common Market
comes into being which require
that the President possess suffi
cient authority to deal with them.
The argument of the second
group is that so great a change
in our traditional tariff policy,
this “giant step,” requires a
longer period of education and
public debate than we have yet
had.

Dropping such legislation into a
Congress which is preoccupied
with an election would almost cer
tainly mean a scrimmage of speci
al interests and a debate at a
much lower level than the sub
ject requires.
THEY feel satisfied that noth
ing will be lost by the longer
period of preparation and incu
bation, and that the Congress will
have a better realization of the
weight of the issue when the en
larged Common Market is in fact
a going concern.

Their reasoning seems to be
sound. It is sound provided that
the President will expound the
new policy with the emphasis
and the attention which its his
toric significance calls for.

In a statement issued jointly
by Mr. Christian Holder and Mr.
Will Clayton, and published as a
Congressional document by Rep.
Hale Boggs’s Committee, they say
that “the time has come for the
United States to take a giant
step.’’ The giant step is in the
field of tariffs and trade policy,
and the direction of the giant
step is towards a much closer
trading relationship with the non-
Communist world.

The purpose of the step is to in
crease greatly the prosperity of
the non-Communist world. The
significance of the step is that it
will draw together the non-Com
munist world into a union quite
capable of confronting the Com
munist orbit confidently, of com
peting with it effectively, and of
co-existing with it securely.

It is a grandiose undertaking.
But it is not a vision in the air.
The Atlantic Community has ex
isted as an historic fact since the
Spanish and the Portugese, the
French, the British, the Dutch
and the Swedes, colonized North
and South America some three
centuries ago.
THAT THERE HAS always
been an Atlantic Community
since then is attested by our own
history. Beginning with colonial
times there has been no great war
in Europe in which Americans
have not become engaged. What
is called American isolationism
was possible only in the 100 year’s
between the battle of Waterloo
and the battle of the Marne—that
is to say in that unique century
when there was no world war.

The experience of the Second
World War has taught the Ameri
can people that it would be an il
lusion to think that they can re
turn to the isolation of the nine
teenth century. Now our people
are beginning to learn that econ
omic isolation, in the sense that
we can regard our trade policy as
a domestic issue, is not only un
workable but undesirable.
It has become unworkable with
the decision of Great Britain to
join the Common Market, a de
cision that may be one of the
most momentous in modern Eu
ropean history. It has become un
desirable to adhere to our tradi
tional tariff policy, because we
cannot afford to miss the oppor
tunity to participate in a move
ment which will lift the non-Com
munist world out of the dol
drums.

THESE ABE BIG words, and
they might well be so much hot
air if it were not that there is al
ready under way negotiation of
(he terms of the new trading com
munity. We shall not come direct
ly into those negotiations until
Britain, having taken care of the
vital interests of the Common
wealth, has been accepted as a
member of the Common Market.
More or less simultaneously
there will come into it also, with
certain reservations, Switzerland,
Austria, and the Scandinavian
countries.

When this has been accomplish
ed, we shall have to be ready to
take what Messrs. Herter and
Clayton call the giant step. The
enlarged Common Market will
contain over 300,000,000 people
working and living in what will
very soon be a free trade area. It
will be a larger free trade area
than the internal market of the
United States, and participating
in this market will be the most
advanced industrial countries in
the world.

There can be no doubt that in
such a big market European in
dustry will advance spectacularly.
As Under-Secretary of State for
Economic Affairs George Ball
pointed out to the Foreign Trade
Convention, the industrial lead
ers of Western Europe “are lay
ing plans for expansion, for addi
tional specialization and market
penetration on a scale that has no
precedents in European history.”
THIS WILL confront us with
the question of whether we
should seal ourselves up in our
own market or move to open up
access for our exports to the
much larger European markets.
If we choose to open up the ac
cess, we shall not obtain it as a
favor or because Europe is grate
ful to us, or even because Europe
depends upon us to save it from
the military power of the Soviet
Union. We shall be able to open
up the European market to
American business only if in re
turn we open up the American
market to European business.
There is general agreement
among those who are studying
and deliberating on the formation
of our own policy. They agree
that our relations with the en
larged Common Market cannot be
worked out item by item, as un
der the existing tariff legislation.
The only way our radically new
relationship can be worked out is
in effect to authorize the Presi
dent to negotiate an economic ar
rangement with the Common

Market providing for a broad re
ciprocal reduction of tariff walls.

AGREEING ON this much,
there is some difference of opin
ion about the political tactics that
the President should adopt. Some
think that he should go to Con
gress during the coming session
and ask for new legislation to re
place the old legislation which
expires in June. Others think that
he should declare and explain the
new policy to this session of Con
gress, but that he should post
pone specific legislation until
1963.

The argument of the first group
is that letting the existing legis
lation expire without substituting
any in its place would give the
impression of a retreat from the
policy of liberalizing trade. Press
ing trade policy issues will arise
before the new Common Market
comes into being which require
that the President possess suffi
cient authority to deal with them.
The argument of the second
group is that so great a change
in our traditional tariff policy,
this “giant step,” requires a
longer period of education and
public debate than we have yet
had.

Dropping such legislation into a
Congress which is preoccupied
with an election would almost cer
tainly mean a scrimmage of speci
al interests and a debate at a
much lower level than the sub
ject requires.
THEY feel satisfied that noth
ing will be lost by the longer
period of preparation and incu
bation, and that the Congress will
have a better realization of the
weight of the issue when the en
larged Common Market is in fact
a going concern.

Their reasoning seems to be
sound. It is sound provided that
the President will expound the
new policy with the emphasis
and the attention which its his
toric significance calls for.
