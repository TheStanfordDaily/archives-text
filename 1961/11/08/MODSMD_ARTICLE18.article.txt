## 
### 
QUITO, Ecuador (UPII- Loyal
government troops smashed an
army revolt yesterday after Pres
ident Jose M, Velasco Ibarra
ousted and arrested his opposition
minded vice president, Carlos J.
Arosemena.

A battalion of engineers at
Chimborazo who opposed Arose
mena’s ouster was battered into
submission in four hours by infan
try rifle fire and an air force
threat to bombard the mutinous
garrison.

FIRST REPORTS said two ar
my men were killed and 11 wound
ed in the brief battle. All were
identified as members of the Chim
borazo garrison.
The powerful Ecuadorean Work
er’s Confederation warned that if
civil war threatened and Velasco
did not resign to forestall it, a
general strike would be called.
Quito was an armed camp with
troops in field garb guarding pub
lic buildings. Police on horseback
and in jeeps patroled the city to
prevent anti-government demon
strations.

The heads of the three armed
forces pledged loyalty to Velasco.
The embattled president called on
the people to take to the streets
“in defense of the constitution.”
Pie said “only sickness or death”
could drive him from office.
AROSEMENA’S ouster and ar
rest was the culmination of weeks
of bitter feuding between the vice
president and Velasco. The presi
dent fired Arosemena and ordered
his arrest on charges that he had
seized control of the congress and
established himself as a dictator.
Arosemena was seized while
leaving the legislative building.
Also arrested were at least four
senators and six deputies. The
moves against the political oppo
sition apparently had army bless
ing. Six tanks were deployed
around the congressional palace
before the arrests.
