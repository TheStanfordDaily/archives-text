# President's New Frontier a Hard One Since '60 Election
## 
### MERRIMAN SMITH UPI White House Reporter 
WASHINGTON (UPD—In the
year since President Kennedy’s
election, the golden fruits of his
victory at the polls have lost some
of their luster.
Kennedy’s New Frontier has
been a hard frontier. Due largely
to Russian truculence and Com
munist expansion, the President
has not known freedom from in
ternational crisis since taking of
fice. Furthermore, he’s convinced
this is the way the world will be
for the foreseeable future.
Domestically, evaluation of his
record in Congress depends in
great measure on the political
faith of the assayer. His adminis
tration's legislative program was
treated well on some points, and
kicked around on others. He has
said publicly that he thought his
first congressional record was a
good one. Behind the scenes, ho is
working energetically to improve
the score next year.
KENNEDY’S popularity re
mains high, according to recent
opinion polls. Paradoxically, how
ever, there have been rumbles re
cently from the liberal flank of his
own party where self-styled “egg
heads” fear the President has not
been sufficiently evangelical in be
half of some of the more flaming
causes espoused during his elec
tion campaign last year.
When the returns rolled in a
year ago, today, even though Ken
nedy's victory margin was razor
thin over his Republican opponent,
Vico President Richard M. Nixon,
some pro-Kennedy liberals envis
ioned at least four and possibly
eight years of marked intellectual
influence in the conduct of gov
ernment.
There was much harking back
to the sleeves-up social revolution
instituted by the late Franklin D.
Roosevelt when he swept into of
fice with his new deal.
LIBERALS WHO expected an
overhaul of government in the pro
portions of 1933 overloked several
contra-indications.
Kennedy’s slim victory margin
robbed him of power in Congress
which a landslide might have pro
vided. The new President also
brought some Republicans into
high federal positions. This an
noyed liberal Democrats visibly,
but Kennedy realized that some
thing other than a completely par
tisan executive structure was de
sirable.
Republican C. Douglas Dillon
was named secretary of the treas
ury, More recently Kennedy pick
ed another Republican, John A.
McCone, to head the Central In
telligence Agency. Dillon was in
the State Department under for
mer President Dwight D. Eisen
hower and McCone was chairman
of Eisenhower’s Atomic Energy
Commission.
KENNEDY’S LIBERAL sup
port is not drifting away because
it has no other place to go in na
tional politics. Some of the liberals
are merely annoyed. Next year
should give them ample opportuni
ty to translate their annoyance in
to action. Kennedy now is plan
ning a major drive in Congress for
medical care for the aged. His re
ciprocal trade, foreign aid and tax
revision programs also will stir
emotions of the political commun
ity.
The Chief Executive would bo

the first to admit, privately at any
rate, that many of his pre-election
and pre-inaugural concepts of the
presidency have undergone rather
extensive alteration.

HE THOUGHT for a time of
holding weekly news conferences,
but in-job experience convinced
him otherwise. He now sometimes
goes as much as six weks between
question - and - answer meetings
with reporters.

He came into office convinced
that regular weekly meetings of
the cabinet and the National Se
curity Council were not neces
sary; that cabinet officers should
remain in frequent and direct con
tact with him during the week.
Kennedy fully intended to hold
the reins as perhaps no other
modern President. These ideas
changed, too; not entirely, hut
they changed. The cabinet and the
NSC now meet most weeks. There
are fewer drop-in conferences
with cabinet officers.

THEN THEBE’S the deficit.
Kennedy vowed last year and ear
ly this year to balance the budget
■if at all possible. The country,
however, wont through a disturb
ing recession in the past winter
and federal funds were felt by the
administration to be necessary to
attack more serious pockets of un
employment and inactivity.

War threats from Southeast
Asia to Berlin boasted the Defense
Department budget and as a re
sult of this the recession and other
factors, Kennedy faces a $6.9 bil
lion deficit at the end of his first
full fiscal year next June 30th.
The President seems to stand
adversity beter than some of his
subordinates who in their partisan
zeal sometimes regard any sort of
reverse as a plot against the Dem
ocratic party. This difference in
reaction may be due to the fact
that Kennedy has much more
Washington experience than some
of his lieutenants.

THE DARKEST clouds for the
President came after the abortive
Cuban invasion attempt last April.
This rattled his administration
badly and for a few torturous
days, there was a confusing state
of charge and counter-charge
within the administration. The ex

pected head-knocking took place
behind closed doors and the Ken
nedy team seemed to move for
ward with greater coordination
after Cuba.
If there has been a central les
son since the election a year ago,
Kennedy and his chief associates
have learned that while the presi
dency has its glamorous, golden
moments, they are comparatively
few when compared with the daily
trip-hammer of trouble, problems
and punishing work.
At the outset of this administra
tion, one bear'd occasionally in the
Kennedy circle of the “fun” in
meeting the challenges of govern
ment. Rarely is the word used
these days.
