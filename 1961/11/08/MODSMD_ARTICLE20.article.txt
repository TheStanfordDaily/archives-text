WESSELL COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
Nick Wessell was right in say
ing that “the obscene antics of the
undergraduate rooting section re
flect nothing but discredit on peo
ple associated with the Universi
ty” only in so far as obscenity dis
credits our society.
For obscenity reflects a basic
conflict in our society and in our
selves that must be resolved if we
are really to mature.
The mark of a mature person is
a coherent set of attitudes. There
is no room for ambivalence to
wards sex, religion, or excrement.
These, we must admit, are good
things, for they make life possible,
and perhaps even exciting.
Yet these are the only things
which obscene words refer to. And
obscenity, which associates hate
and disgust with these things, is
condemned. Why? Is it because
our society is afraid to admit this
ambivalence?
If so, then let everyone swear in
the open, where we can combat
ambivalence. Let everyone swear
in the open, where each can exor
cise his hate and resentment with
sympathy and approval, not con
demnation.
