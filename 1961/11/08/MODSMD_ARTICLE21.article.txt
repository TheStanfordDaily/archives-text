CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
Editor, The Daily:
In the Daily editorial of Nov. 3,
you stated that one of the more
important arguments against cap
ital punishment “is ihe fact that it
accomplishes nothing.” I would
like to observe that capital punish
ment does serve the purpose of
eliminating from society murder
ers who have killed and who may
kill again if given the chance.
You also assert that if the effort
made to rehabilitate the criminal
fails, "the person can be kept iso
lated from society without undue
trouble.”
But criminals do escape occas
ionally: one in particular, a con
victed killer by the name of Cor
bett, was serving time in Califor
nia when he escaped and dropped
out of sight. Later he was tracked
down and found guilty of the kid
nap-murder of wealthy Adolf
Coors in Colorado.
This second killing could have
been prevented had Corbett been
executed or even securely impris
oned in the first place. Murderers,
by good behavior, parole, or escape
can free themselves.
In “taking a second look at how
seriously America values human
life,” one must not only consider
the life of the convict but also
other lives which he might extin
guish if he is allowed freedom.
If an effective, escape-proof re
habilitation system could be de
veloped, perhaps it would be bet
ter than capital punishment. But
the present system of capital pun
ishment is not so senseless as you
described it. Carolyn Patten
RED THAN DEAD?
Editor, The Daily:
The “better to be Red than dead”
school bases its argument on one
shaky assumption: That if all the
world were under Communist con
trol there would be no, or perhaps
less, possibility of a nuclear war
which would engulf and destroy
all of human civilization.
For all the preaching of Commu
nist theoreticians, communism, in
practical application, has not
changed human nature, which is
basically selfish. Nations, red or
white, work for self interest.
The Communist and capitalist
groups of nations work for a
peaceful solution to the world’s
problems because of self interest
—self preservation.
Today, the Communist world is
loosely united and exhibits many
signs of internal struggle. Faced

with a common enemy, the capi
talist world, Communists still
find difficulty in working to
gether.
Remove the threat of the com
mon enemy and the Communist
world would divide into groups as
different as are the capitalist de
mocracies and the fascist states
in the capitalist world.
To say “I’d rather bo Red than
dead” is meaningless, a Commu
nist world wouldn’t end the threat
of nuclear war. Ward McAfee
FUNDAMENTAL STANDARD
Editor, The Daily:
On Monday night a junior girl
attended a corridor meeting at
Branner to dispel any fears that
we freshman girls might have
about Big Game weekend.
In the course of her discussion,
she said that we should look only
to our own morals and pass no
judgments on others whose mor
als might be, not inferior to, but
“different” from our own.
Unless the transgressors cause
us inconvenience, we art; not to
inconvenience them. When some
of us pointed out that the Funda
mental Standard makes us all, at
the last, our brother’s keeper, she
said the administration did not in
tend that the Standard be practi
cally applied.
The Standard may provide a
theoretical basis for morality, but
the sophisticates of the school rec
ognize the relativity of morality
and the inadvisability of informing
on fellow students.
As a non-sophisticate, I think
that the Standard obliges us to
take a moral point of view. Wheth
er the vices of others inconveni
ence us does not relate to the
Standard: we have morally obli
gated ourselves, implicitly by com
ing to Stanford and explicitly by
signing a pledge, to abide by its
provisions on moral violations.
When we ignore violations of
the Standard, we reveal ourselves
to be hypocrites—popular hypo
crites perhaps, but hypocrites
nonetheless.
I realize that my reaction to the
; girl’s talk bears an uncomfortable
j resemblance to righteous indigna
tion, and I realize too that such in
dignation has no place on a college
campus.
I can hope only that they who
disagree with me will not flatly
condemn my remarks because
l they are wrong, but condone them
I because they are “different.”
