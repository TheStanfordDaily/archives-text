# Ex-McCarthyite Heading Muckraking Californian
## 
### RON RAPOPORT Associate Editor 
In January of 1960, an ex-news
paperman and ex-McCarthyite
named Burton Wolfe moved into
a tiny San Francisco apartment
behind a Chinese laundry and,
with $!,■400, started a publication
which he calls, “either the last
of the muckraking movement in
America, or the beginning of a
revival of muckraking.”
Originally started as a tabloid
newspaper, the publication was,
after two months, changed into
its present format; a monthly
magazine called The Californian.
In the past 22 months Wolfe
and The Californian (the names
are interchangeable) have pre
sented a series of articles almost
totally unlike anything currently
appearing in any portion of the
American press.
SOME OF THE titles are: Chi
natown USA, the Unassimilated
People: how 50,000 persons live
in an American ghetto; O’Malley
Takes Los Angeles; Racketeers
in the Hospital and Health Insur
ance Business; Censorship in the
United States; and Police Mal
practice in L.A. and S.F.
Wolfe claims accomplishments
both of a general and specific
variety.
He says The Californian “has
given a few thousand people in
formation they otherwise might
not have had. ... It has given
hundreds of thousands more the
same information through other
publications, books and radio and
TV stations which have made use
of The Californian’s material.”
Teachers in high schools and col
leges have made use of the mag
azine, Wolfe says.
M O It E SPECIFICALLY, he
says, former Gov. Goodwin
Knight had some material ap
pearing in the magazine about
San Francisco Mayor George
Christopher read on a Los An
geles television station. The com
mentator “even held up the ma
yor’s police mug shot—quite an
education for Californians.”
An article on the San Francisco
Chronicle’s censorship of Drew
Pearson caused some changes by
that paper, says Wolfe. “The Cali
fornian’s material on the Ameri
can Patients Association was
credited for bringing success to
the organization and its health
plan.
“Most recently, The Californi
an’s material on the HCUA film
‘Operation Abolition’ and the
Hoover Report, ‘Communist Tar-1
get Youth,’ caused some changes
in Defense Department plans for
a couple of films on Communist
manipulation of youth.
“SEN. STROM THURMOND of
South Carolina became pretty up
set over it and introduced mate
rial from The Californian on the |
floor of the Senate,”
The Californian’s circulation
has risen t0’6,000, allowing Wolfe
to move into an office at 1005
Market St. and hire an assistant.
He says that all revenue comes
from subscriptions ($5 a year),
newsstand sales and donations
from “individuals who believed in
what I was doing.
“I continue to struggle on this
way, with no organizational sup
port and no financial angel or
angels. ... I have never been
able to obtain any advertising to
speak of. . . .”
A NATIVE OF Washington,
D.C., Wolfe, 29, was graduated
Phi Beta Kappa from George
Washington University where he
majored in journalism.
He worked for several newspa
pers during and after college
(and for Stars and Stripes while
in the Army for two years) and
eventually wound up at the San
Francisco branch of the old Inter
national News Service. At that
time he was also writing maga
zine articles—mostly on medical
and scientific subjects and he
won several national awards.
When INS was sold to the
United Press Wolfe decided to
quit newspapering, despite what
he terms some attractive offers
to stay in the business. His rea
soning for this and for why he
started The Californian is impor
tant to the function of the maga
zine. To quote at length:
“DURING COLLEGE days, I
was a McCarthyite, a dedicated

fan of Joe McCarthy. (By the
time I was out of the Army and
working for the Burlington, Vt.,
Free Press) I had swung away
from McCarthy, but was still a
conservative Republican. As I
moved into politics and snooped
into things as a reporter, I began
seeing things that were contrary
to what I had been told by the
newspapers and Time magazine,
both of which I had believed in
implicitly.
“I found that I was not being
permitted to cover and write
about what I considered most
important and that in some cases
my material would be cut out by
the editor even though it was
nothing more than a straight ac
count of something that was tak
ing place or that was being said.
“Soon, like all reporters, I fell
into the ‘system.’ It’s difficult
for anyone who has not been a
working reporter on a daily news
paper or wire service to under
stand this, but you get to know
after a time just what you can
and cannot say, what subjects are
taboo, what slant you must take.
“BY THE TIME INS was sold
to UP, I was very disillusioned
with the newspaper business

especially here in California,
where the situation is much worse
than it is in Vermont, New York
or Washington, D.C. I felt that
the people of California were be
ing fed a bunch of half-truths and
were getting through the daily
newspaper the philosophy of the
Republican Party and Big Busi
ness in preponderance to any
thing else.
“I saw some of the most vital
stories of the day, issued in gov
ernment press releases or in wire
service copy or in speeches by
congressmen, being suppressed by
the newspapers. While stories
highly critical of labor would be
given top play, stories critical of
big business would either be
buried or omitted from the paper
altogether
“Controversial items that would
offend advertisers or particular
groups of subscribers were kept
out of the papers. As I related
these things to my own life, I
found that I had been a McCar
thyite in college because McCar
thy was stating what seemed to
be facts, and I could not find any
contradictory facts in my news
paper or Time magazine.

“I FOUND editorials against
him, but no facts and no explana
tions of what he was really up to.
By the same token, I found later
that I had been a Republican be
cause I believed what I read in
the papers and Time, and what
I read I later found to be untrue.

“I thought to myself: if I, a
Phi Beta Kappa graduate and a
journalist by trade, can be brain
washed into being a McCarthyite
and a Republican by my daily
newspapers and Time magazine,
what then of persons with less
knowledge and less access to in
formation than I have?

“Once I asked myself that ques
tion, I could no longer content
myself with living in the world
of Ihe popular press. I knew that
I had to start a newspaper which
would print what no one else
would print, without, regard to
whether or not it offended any
one, hut with strict regard for
the facts.” End quote.
WOLFE SAYS he was con
vinced that, even with his small
amount of capital, if he could

•Rather than put in a full-page
ad that would attract a lot of
attention we have decided on in
serting this little masterpiece.
Not only does a full-page ad cost
a big chunk of money, but it does
not attract the discriminating
buyer, i.e., the student with
money. (Everyone is aware that
all faculty members have untold
wealth or they would be working
at Lockheed.)

This is mainly aimed at those
persons owning, leasing, borrow
ing, or otherwise in possession of
an automobile. Occasionally, De
troit’s products have breakdowns,
need minor adjustments, and the
like. When this occurs we feel
that the car should be brought to
us for repairs, as this is the way
we have chosen to make our way
in this world. Automatic transmis
sions are our specialty, but we
have been persuaded to attack
other types upon request, at the
same low rates. We also are well
versed in motors, brakes, etc. Fast,
dependable service is our watch
word. (Sorry, but we will not
attempt repairs on Vespa motor
scooters.)

only make a start, various organ
izations who would see the need
for what he was doing would give
financial backing. His eventual
goal was a daily newspaper.
“When I approached any or
ganization, however, I found no
sympathy with such a project, or
else the demand that I throw in
with the organization before sup
port could be given. There seemed
to be great all-around fear of a
publication that would not follow
any given political or socio-eco
nomic line.”

Noting that the original name
of the publication was The Cali
fornia Liberal, Wolfe says that it
led people to believe that he
would be following “something
called the ‘liberal line,’ which
seems to mean all things to all
people.
“BUT I WASN’T in business
to follow any line. I was in busi
ness to publish a truly free, inde
pendent newspaper devoted to
truth, facts, controversy and com
plete freedom of speech and
thought. Such a newspaper seems
to terrify everyone and defy the
imagination.”

Wolfe says his biggest prob
lems at the moment are lack of
money and “mass apathy.”
He says, “I could . . . put The
Californian over if I had thou
sands of dollars to spread the
magazine all over the newsstands
and advertise it heavily over ra
dio, TV and in other publica
tions . . .

“If I should ever gain support
and wide readership of this mag
azine, you would see a terrific
force for reform at work in the
nation; you would see what a
crusading journal can accomplish.
I never give up hope.”


BURTON WOLFE, EDITOR (and staff) of The Californian, calls his
venture "either the last of the muckraking movement in America,
or the beginning of a revival of muckraking.
