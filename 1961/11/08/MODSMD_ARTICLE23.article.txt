# JOURNEY TO 'FIRELAND'
## SC Gets Ready for Cards 
### 
USC’s Trojan footballers will be
shooting for a share of first place
in the aging Big Five pennant race
when they meet a determined
group of Stanford Indians, seek
ing their first AAWU win. this
Saturday in the spacious Los An
geles Memorial Coliseum.
With UCLA, the current loop
leader, meeting TCU in a non
league tift Friday night, a win for
the Trojans would propel them in
to a tie with the Uclans. The
Bruins currently own a 2-0 confer
ence mark with the Trojans sec
ond at 1-0-1.
LAST WEEKEND at Seattle,
the Trojans corrected what had
previously been their biggest
weakness defense against the
Washington Huskies, but had a
poor day offensively to gain only
a 0-0 draw.
Against Stanford, the Smogville
eleven’s offense will be further
hampered by the absence of fleet
Willie Brown. The USC halfback
suffered a foot injury against the
Huskies, and according to Trojan
coach Johnny McKay will not see
any action this weekend.
Brown’s value to the Southland
ers shows up in AAWU individual
statistics where, despite seeing
only sparing action, Brown ranks
fifth in rushing and fourth in pass
receiving. The 5-11, 170 sophomore
speedster is the same type of
threat as Oregon’s now notorious
Mel Renfro and will be all Stan
ford can handle if he is healthy,
HOWEVER, in big fullback Ben
Wilson. USC has a potent offens
ive weapon to help offset the pos
sible loss of Brown. Currently,
third in AAWU rushing statistics
with 433 yards in 90 attempts, the
powerful (5-11, 215) junior can
make his own holes.
El Troje also has the top pass
ing combination in the Big Five
helping to make their offense go
in soph quarterback Pete Bea
thard and another sophomore, Hal
Bedsole, a quarterback converted
to end.
BEATHAKD has passed for 457
yards and a .535 average (38 x 71)
in seven encounters, while Bedsole
has snatched 23 aerials for 436
yards and 5 TD’s as each leads the
AAWU in the passing and receiv
ing categories respectively.


HAL TOBIN will be in the USC bockfield Saturday when the Tro
jans entertain Stanford in the southland. The Cards are hoping to
start a fire of their own, and stopping the likes of Tobin and Willie
Brown, if he plays, would certainly aid the blaze.
