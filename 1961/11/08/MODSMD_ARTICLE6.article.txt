### 
Voting in the final elections gets
underway today at Engineering
Corner and at the Post Office.
Polls will be open there from 8:30
to 3 and at the Main Library from

Voters will elect one member to
Men’s Council, LASSU representa
tives from Ruble and Wilbur, and
a president and vice president for
the Class of ’65.

There will bo no voting for Head
Yell Leader, but Election Com
Chairman Chuck Bischoff still ex
pects a good turnout. “Over 1000
freshmen voted in the primary,
and with two extremely close
races in prospect for president and
vice president, I would expect
eleven or twelve hundred for the
finals.” Bischoff said. Only two
votes separated presidential can
didates Brooke Taylor and Biff
Barker in the primaries.
Although upper class women
will not be able to vote for any
offices today, all men, including
grad students, can vote for Men’s
Council. “Although this office
doesn't receive much fanfare, it
probably is more important in
terms of responsibility than any
other student .iob,” Bischoff em
phasized. John Bannister and Ran
dy Devening are in a runoff for
the position.
Students are reminded that they
must present their student body
cards in order to vote. Proxy vot
ing is prohibited. On the final elec
tion, no write-ins are permitted.
