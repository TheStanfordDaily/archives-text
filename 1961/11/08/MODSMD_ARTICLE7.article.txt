overflow crowd last night,
oom-only audience of more than
The crowd began gathering an
hour and a half before the Tues
day Evening Series address and
the doors were closed 20 minutes
early. Several hundred persons
were turned away.
Shirer pointed out that the dif
ference between the world situa
tion today and when he witnessed
Hitler’s war preparations in the
1930’s “are very great and to our
advantage.’’
“IN ’39 . . . Hitler was abso
lutely sure he could attack other
countries and Germany could not
suffer in any way. Today . . .
Khrushchev knows, unlike Hiller,
that if he launches a world war,
Russia will be destroyed.”
Charging the Russian premier
with using “Hitler tactics,” Shirer
declared the Berlin crisis has been
“deliberately and artificially man
ufactured and provoked by . . .
Khrushchev.”
But the Soviet Union will not
go to war over Berlin, he said,
explaining that Khrushchev took
his threatening attitude on Berlin
“to humiliate the West” and show
Red China that he and Russia are
strong.
THE FORMER foreign corre
spondent predicted “ultimately
. . . we’ll get atomic disarma
ment,” but called for the United
States to “have the gumption to
stay strong” while not fearing to
negotiate with Russia.
Turning to present-day Ger
many, Shirer said “the main Ger
man problem concerns the Ger
man people themselves. Have
they change? Have they learned
any lessons?
“I would feel better if Nazism
were dead” in Germany, but “I
doubt if it or the new neo-Nazism
is dead,” he said.
Many former Nazis hold down
important jobs in the government
and business, he added.
SHIRER SAID he is “be i n g
roundly attacked in Germany”
for his best-selling book, “The
Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,”
because, he said, the Germans
haven't changed much.
Russia’s policy toward Ger
many is aimed at keeping it
“weak and divided and thereby
no threat to Russia.” The author
commented that “Russia is not
the only one who has had that
policy. The British and French
from the very beginning have
opposed German reunification.”
France’s Charles de Gaulle
wouldn’t continue his pro-Ger
man policy “if he had to deal
with a big, reunified Germany,”
Shirer asserted.
