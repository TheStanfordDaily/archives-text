# Wagner Wins in NY, Demos Upset Mitchell
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The
Democrats retained the New York
mayorship and the New Jersey
governorship last night as returns
rolled in from the nation’s off-year
elections.
Robert F. Wagner, the Demo
cratic incumbent in New York,
took on early lead and by mid-eve
ning had been re-elected to the key
post. Louis J. Lefkowitz, his Re
publican opponent, conceded
shortly after 9 p.m. EST.
Returns from 3950 of 4,765 elec
tion districts gave Wagner 970,298
votes to 624,116 for Lefkowitz.
IT WAS nip-and-tuck during the
erly count in New Jersey, But
Richard J. Hughes, running with
President Kennedy’s backing, lat
er pulled away for victory over
former GOP Labor Secretary
James P. Mitchell.
The decision came much more
quickly in Virginia, where Demo
crat Albertis S. Harrison won
easily over Republican H. Clyde
Pearson for the governorship.
This was expected, since Virginia
has not had a Republican chief ex
ecutive in nearly a century.
John M. Bailey, Democratic
National Chairman, said the Re
publican defeat was a rebuff to
New York Gov. Nelson A Rocke
feller, whom he accused of using
the campaign to “advance his own
personal national ambitions”
Rockefeller is considered a con
tender for the GOP presidential
nomination in 1964.
THE REPUBLICANS pulled a
major upset in Louisville and Jef
ferson County, Ky„ which had
been Democratic for 28 years.
They won there in the state legis
lature race.
GOP National Chairman Wil
liam E. Miller said the Kentucky
voting was “a good omen for
1962.”
In Detroit, Democrat Lucien N.
Nedzi won the congressional seat
for Michigan’s Ist District, rolling
up a big margin over Republican
Walter Czarnecki. The district is
heavily Democratic.
The New York and New Jersey
races were the center of this off
year political ring.
Kennedy campaigned on behalf
j of Wagner and Hughes. Former
j President Dwight D. Eisenhower
I went to bat for their GOP oppon-
I ents.
