# Placement Service Links Stanford Students With World of Business and Professions
## 
### BILL SMITH 
Nestled in a corner of the first
floor of Encina Hall are the Stan
ford Placement Services. As one
of the few contacts between the
Stanford student body and the
world of commerce and trade, the
Services provide a meeting ground
for prospective employers and em
ployees.
Everyone eventually needs a
job and the Placement Services
are on hand to supply the oppor
tunity for Stanford students to
investigate every field of business,
industry, government and educa
tion. Liberal arts majors, engin
eers, teachers, prospective civil
•servants -all these people can find
positions for themselves through
the Services.
THE METHODS, procedures
and opportunities of the Place
ment Services will be outlined to
morrow at 7:30 p.m, at the Physics
Lecture Hall by William L, Lowe,
associate director of the Services,
and Mrs. Mary Evans, assistant
director. They will speak on “Busi
ness and the Liberal Arts Gradu
ate.’’ This talk will he followed by
a question and answer period

about the Services and Job oppor
tunities in general.
The Services are divided into
three departments concerned with
employment after graduation. Dr.
Richard D. Boyce, who received
his Ed. D. from Stanford in 1960,
is the director of the entire organ
ization and serves as supervisor of
Educational Administration place
ment. This department places ad
ministrators in all levels of educa
tion.
The second department, admin
istered by Mrs. Mary Evans who
obtained her A.B. and M.A. from
Stanford, is concerned with place
ment of teachers and women in in
dustry. The third department, ad
ministered by William L. Lowe,
and his assistant. Paul Williams,
is concerned with business and
technical placement.
THE SERVICES ALSO run two
departments concerned with stu
dents still attending the Universi
ty. These departments are the
Student Employment which lists
part-time work for students dur
ing the regular sessions, and the
Summer Employment service
Which lists summer jobs for slu

dents.
All the departments of the Serv- i
ices require registration in the
Services’ offices. Registration, en
couraged at the beginning of the
senior year, is mandatory for use
of the Services’ facilities, but is a
painless process refined through j
years of use. Registration blanks |
are available at the Placement 1
Services’ offices in Encina.
OVER THE PAST years Stan- 1
ford has grown and the Placement j
Services have grown with the Uni
versity. The number of registrants j
at the Services has increased on j
the average of 10 per cent a year |
for the past three years. Business
and technical placements are up
33 per cent over last year.
Tlie phenomenal growth of the
Services is apparent by the in
crease in companies represented
and jobs offered. In 1960 there
were ,390 jobs offered for women
in industry. This year there are
832 offered.
THE PLACEMENT SERVICES
are available to all Stanford stu
dents and alumni. Last year Mrs.
Evans’ department placed 173
graduating senior women in jobs j

in industry. In addition the depart
ment placed 168 alumni who had
been out of school from one to
forty years.
Lowe views the Services’ job as
three fold. First, the Services have
a duty to the students of the Uni
versity. Second, they perform
service to business or institutions
throughout the country. Finally,
they have a responsibility to the
University.
A man must have an objective
and the Placement Services try to
find the best means of placing a
man in the field in which he has
Interest and capability. But the
man has to have “a willingness to
empty wastebaskets for a while,”
Lowe said.
FOLLOWING T MIS LIN E,
Lowe said, “There is no degree in
the University which will guaran
tee the golden staircase to suc
cess.”
Low e is at present on a crusade,
as he says, “To prove to the liberal
arts men that there is a place for
them in business.” The Placement
Services are for other than grad
students, engineers or science ma
jors.

the average of 10 per cent a year |
for the past three years. Business
and technical placements are up
33 per cent over last year.
Tlie phenomenal growth of the
Services is apparent by the in
crease in companies represented
and jobs offered. In 1960 there
were ,390 jobs offered for women
in industry. This year there are
832 offered.
THE PLACEMENT SERVICES
are available to all Stanford stu
dents and alumni. Last year Mrs.
Evans’ department placed 173
graduating senior women in jobs j

in industry. In addition the depart
ment placed 168 alumni who had
been out of school from one to
forty years.
Lowe views the Services’ job as
three fold. First, the Services have
a duty to the students of the Uni
versity. Second, they perform
service to business or institutions
throughout the country. Finally,
they have a responsibility to the
University.
A man must have an objective
and the Placement Services try to
find the best means of placing a
man in the field in which he has
Interest and capability. But the
man has to have “a willingness to
empty wastebaskets for a while,”
Lowe said.
FOLLOWING T MIS LIN E,
Lowe said, “There is no degree in
the University which will guaran
tee the golden staircase to suc
cess.”
Low e is at present on a crusade,
as he says, “To prove to the liberal
arts men that there is a place for
them in business.” The Placement
Services are for other than grad
students, engineers or science ma
jors.
Nestled in a corner of the first
floor of Encina Hall are the Stan
ford Placement Services. As one
of the few contacts between the
Stanford student body and the
world of commerce and trade, the
Services provide a meeting ground
for prospective employers and em
ployees.
Everyone eventually needs a
job and the Placement Services
are on hand to supply the oppor
tunity for Stanford students to
investigate every field of business,
industry, government and educa
tion. Liberal arts majors, engin
eers, teachers, prospective civil
•servants -all these people can find
positions for themselves through
the Services.
THE METHODS, procedures
and opportunities of the Place
ment Services will be outlined to
morrow at 7:30 p.m, at the Physics
Lecture Hall by William L, Lowe,
associate director of the Services,
and Mrs. Mary Evans, assistant
director. They will speak on “Busi
ness and the Liberal Arts Gradu
ate.’’ This talk will he followed by
a question and answer period

about the Services and Job oppor
tunities in general.
The Services are divided into
three departments concerned with
employment after graduation. Dr.
Richard D. Boyce, who received
his Ed. D. from Stanford in 1960,
is the director of the entire organ
ization and serves as supervisor of
Educational Administration place
ment. This department places ad
ministrators in all levels of educa
tion.
The second department, admin
istered by Mrs. Mary Evans who
obtained her A.B. and M.A. from
Stanford, is concerned with place
ment of teachers and women in in
dustry. The third department, ad
ministered by William L. Lowe,
and his assistant. Paul Williams,
is concerned with business and
technical placement.
THE SERVICES ALSO run two
departments concerned with stu
dents still attending the Universi
ty. These departments are the
Student Employment which lists
part-time work for students dur
ing the regular sessions, and the
Summer Employment service
Which lists summer jobs for slu

dents.
All the departments of the Serv- i
ices require registration in the

about the Services and Job oppor
tunities in general.
The Services are divided into
three departments concerned with
employment after graduation. Dr.
Richard D. Boyce, who received
his Ed. D. from Stanford in 1960,
is the director of the entire organ
ization and serves as supervisor of
Educational Administration place
ment. This department places ad
ministrators in all levels of educa
tion.
The second department, admin
istered by Mrs. Mary Evans who
obtained her A.B. and M.A. from
Stanford, is concerned with place
ment of teachers and women in in
dustry. The third department, ad
ministered by William L. Lowe,
and his assistant. Paul Williams,
is concerned with business and
technical placement.
THE SERVICES ALSO run two
departments concerned with stu
dents still attending the Universi
ty. These departments are the
Student Employment which lists
part-time work for students dur
ing the regular sessions, and the
Summer Employment service
Which lists summer jobs for slu

dents.
All the departments of the Serv- i
ices require registration in the
Services’ offices. Registration, en
couraged at the beginning of the
senior year, is mandatory for use
of the Services’ facilities, but is a
painless process refined through j
years of use. Registration blanks |
are available at the Placement 1
Services’ offices in Encina.
OVER THE PAST years Stan- 1
ford has grown and the Placement j
Services have grown with the Uni
versity. The number of registrants j
at the Services has increased on j
the average of 10 per cent a year |
for the past three years. Business
and technical placements are up
33 per cent over last year.
Tlie phenomenal growth of the
Services is apparent by the in
crease in companies represented
and jobs offered. In 1960 there
were ,390 jobs offered for women
in industry. This year there are
832 offered.
THE PLACEMENT SERVICES
are available to all Stanford stu
dents and alumni. Last year Mrs.
Evans’ department placed 173
graduating senior women in jobs j

in industry. In addition the depart
ment placed 168 alumni who had
been out of school from one to
forty years.
Lowe views the Services’ job as
three fold. First, the Services have
a duty to the students of the Uni
versity. Second, they perform
service to business or institutions
throughout the country. Finally,
they have a responsibility to the
University.
A man must have an objective
and the Placement Services try to
find the best means of placing a
man in the field in which he has
Interest and capability. But the
man has to have “a willingness to
empty wastebaskets for a while,”
Lowe said.
FOLLOWING T MIS LIN E,
Lowe said, “There is no degree in
the University which will guaran
tee the golden staircase to suc
cess.”
Low e is at present on a crusade,
as he says, “To prove to the liberal
arts men that there is a place for
them in business.” The Placement
Services are for other than grad
students, engineers or science ma
jors.
