A TIDAL WAVE OF HOPE
MR. KHRUSHCHEV is 67. He plans to see
the Red Flag flying over every country in
the world during his lifetime. He thinks he can do
it. Every decision and action he takes over Berlin,
Laos, the Congo or at the United Nations is meas
ured against this one aim.
He has an ideology.
Nations outside the Communist bloc lack any
common ideology or world aim. They are divided
amongst themselves. They think that if they stand
up to Mr. Khrushchev they may be forced into
atomic war.
Appeasement is no answer to dictatorship.
The idealism of the United Nations without an
ideology often becomes the tool for Moscow’s aim.
Making big speeches to satisfy public opinion at
home and backing them by weak action when we
meet the Communists at the conference table
destroys the faith of the millions in the power of
the democratic way of life. Squatting in the streets,
however sincere, is no answer to the threat of the
H-bomb.
The answer is to stand up and fight in every
nation, everywhere, for an ideology that changes
Communist and non-Communist alike and unites
every race, class and color in the supreme task of
the century—the remaking of the world.
Men with an ideology superior to Communism
can not only stand up to Mr. Khrushchev but enlist
him in a greater revolution.
General Carpentier of France who was in
command of the land forces of NATO for Central
Europe and who had the training of the Brazilian
Army and commanded the French forces in Indo
china and elsewhere, put the issue clearly at the
World Assembly at Caux this year when he said,
“We need a tidal wave of Moral Re-Armament to
sweep across the world. Then men in Government
will be forced to make the right decisions that
spring not only from the intellect, but from our
hearts and faith.”
THE TIDE OF COMMUNISM
CAN BE TURNED
This tidal wave is flooding across the conti
nents. Marshal Tavora, national hero of Brazil,
flew last week to Rome. There he told leaders of
the Church and State, “With Moral Re-Armament
the tide of Communism in my country and Latin
America can be turned.”
His colleague General Bethlem, former Brazil
ian Ambassador in Bolivia and Pakistan, on that
same day was meeting in Los Angeles with Mr.
Kishi, Prime Minister of Japan until last year.
Both General Bethlem and Mr. Kishi had been at
Caux two weeks before. The General said, “In
Brazil and Peru 900,000 of my countrymen have
seen the Japanese play The Tiger. In the last five
months millions more have seen it on television. Its
message has already saved Brazil from civil war.”
He was referring to a play by the revolution
ary students of the Zengakuren of Japan. These
students led the riots in Tokyo last year w'hich
caused President Eisenhower’s visit to Japan to
be canceled. The students changed. They wrote a
play describing how Communism had captured
them through their own moral compromise and
how Moral Re-Armament had taught them to go
not right, not left, but straight. Then they went
to America and apologized to Eisenhower. He
urged them to go to Latin America.

Marshal Juarez Tavora, national hero of Brazil
In Manaus, a Communist stronghold of Brazil,
a thousand miles up the Amazon River, 90,000 peo
ple in one night alone saw a presentation of The
Tiger in the football stadium. On the same night
the Communist counter-rally across the road for
the anniversary of Castro’s Cuban revolution drew
a total of 40 people. One of the students said, “It
is the greatest event that has ever taken place in
Manaus. It has revolutionized our thinking.”
THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE
CRISIS IN BERLIN
Mr. Kishi, speaking with General Bethlem in
Los Angeles, told of how he had discussed with Gen
eral Eisenhower last week at Gettysburg the im
pact of the work of Moral Re-Armament through
out the South American continent. He said, “I
apologized to General Eisenhower for last year’s
riots and invited him to come as soon as possible
to Japan. 1 had two objectives in making my pres
ent journey around the world. The first was to
attend the Moi’al Re-Armament Assembly at Caux.
This Assembly made an impression on me that is
both deep and unforgettable. Secondly, I wanted
to meet again the world statesmen I had known
as Prime Minister. The only answer to the crisis in
Berlin and the challenge of Communism today is
the ideology of Moral Re-Armament. Nations to
day must form a solid front, a unity of purpose
and of spirit so evident to the Communist world
that they will not indulge in miscalculation nor
misunderstand our aim and goal. MRA is producing
this unity which transcends all national boundaries
and all minor divisions.”
In September Mr. Saburo Chiba, for three
years Chairman of the National Security Commit
tee of the Japanese Diet, flew straight from Caux
to confer with President Prado of Peru. He said
that his own experience as head of Security had
led him to two conclusions on how to answer Com
munism: (1) To impact the masses with a more
effective ideology and (2) To unite the countries of
the free world in a common strategy.
He told the President that no exclusively na
tional plan is adequate today. While the 13 Com
munist bloc countries are united in one global
strategy, 82 nations have not yet reached a com
mon mind and goal “in order to create a united
force in the free world.” He continued, “We must
create a united force of parliamentarians from
every nation. This is already being done in many
of the free countries.”

Former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi of Japan
TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IN PERU
President Prado invited Moral Re-Armament
to his country “to save democracy in Peru.” At
the National Stadium in Lima 60,000 people stood
in silence for a minute to honor the memory of
Frank Buchman, initiator of Moral Re-Armament,
before seeing a performance of The Tiger. Ten
thousand who could not get in listened over the
loudspeakers outside.
A force of these Japanese students went to San
Marcos University. This is the University which
organized the stoning of Vice President Nixon when
he visited Peru. Speaking on the Peruvian National
Radio after meeting the Japanese, one of these
student leaders said, “Five days ago we had riots.
Moral Re-Armament has made us understand that
the divisions which exist between political groups
arise because each group is out for itself. MRA
has come at the right moment to Peru.”
Another student leader said on the National
Radio: “In this atomic age man must give the
answer to exploitation by either Communism or
capitalism. Here is an ideology which rebuilds the
chaotic world today, which gives food to the
hungry, work to the unemployed and nils the empty
spirit of man which has been lost in immorality
and corruption.”
This week in Peru 40,000 people, including
thousands of Indians in colorful dress, thronged
to the great Sacsayhuaman fortress, stronghold of
the ancient Inca civilization, now known as the Mos
cow of Peru, to see The Tiger and hear it in the
original Inca language. The head of Indian affairs
said, “Your philosophy is going to change the face
of the earth bringing justice, bread and an
answer.”
The Moral Re-Armament force in Latin
America is moving from Brazil and Peru to Chile,
Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries of that con
tinent.
IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE
IN EUROPE
At the same time a force of 400 from 36
nations is sweeping through countries of Europe
in an ideological offensive to answer defeatism,
Communism and division. Among them are fifty
Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World
War II. General Ho Y r ing-chin said, “We lost the
mainland of China because we lacked an ideology.
The materialism in our own life was exploited by
Prime Minister U Nu of Burma
the Communists to take over China. We sacrificed
our country for our selfishness. I have been more
than thirty years a soldier, and I say that the way
to secure peace and freedom for the world is Moral
Re-Armament.”
These fifty Chinese have put their burning
convictions into a play called The Dragon, which
shows the tragedy of a nation lost through the
selfishness of men and gives the hope of an answer.
One of the leading industrialists of Europe,
after seeing The Dragon, said, “Nobody who sees
this play can be the same again. What I like most
about Moral Re-Armament is that it challenges the
rich, as it does everybody, to change their whole
motive of life.”
The former Comintern delegate, Hans Bjerk
holt, co-founder of the Norwegian Communist
Party, spoke last week to 22,000 people at a mass
demonstration with the Chinese play, The Dragon,
in the football stadium at Lucerne. “We are at the
most serious point in the history of mankind,” he
said, “when the leaders of the West start to waver
before Khrushchev. Our task is to move the masses
and give them courage to stand firm. MRA is the
superior ideology that has the power to unite East
and West. It is the next step forward for Com
munist and non-Communist alike.”
Gabriel Marcel, the French philosopher and
playwright, said at Lucerne, “Moral Re-Armament
is an immense effort to create a new living fabric
of humanity right across the world. In France to
day more and more men are responding to this
road.”
Vaterland, Swiss Catholic newspaper, wrote
of The Dragon, “Thus far the Chinese have been
the main agents of world Communism on many
fronts in Africa and South America. Now for the
first time in the history of the ideological struggle
representatives of Free China have appeared on
the scene, blazing a trail with their message. We
wei’e literally shaken as the play unfolded before
our eyes —a play that ends with a brilliant finale
as men realize that the power of the ideology of
Moral Re-Armament can usher in a new and bet
ter age. We made our way home with a great hope
in our hearts.”
The Moral Re-Armament force and the Chin
ese are being greeted by crowds of thousands night
after night who say that in their message they see
hope for peace in the world and the unity of
Europe. Civic leaders of Berlin ax’e among those
who have invited this force to their city. They be
lieve that the x’oot problem is not a wall that divides
a city or a continent but the steely selfishness that
separates man from man and all men from the gov
ernment of God.
Many African countries have invited the
forces of Mox-al Re-Ax’mament to come immedi
ately to their continent. President Kasavubu sent
his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
Africa. If the Congo goes Communist, all Africa
will follow. It is not enough to give dollars to un
derdeveloped countries. We must win the hearts
of the people. What we need is an ideology. That
ideology is Moral Re-Armament.” He told mox’e
than a thousand delegates from evex’y part of the
world that in the last twelve montlxs 483 I’adio
broadcasts about Moi'al Re-Armament have gone
out in five Congolese languages to all parts of his
country on the National Radio.
MORAL RE ARMAMENT OR
FINAL ANNIHILATION
U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, brought a
delegation of his countrymen to Caux last month.
On leaving he said, “Moral Re-Armament must go
on for ever if we want to prevent mankind from
plunging into final annihilation. If we want to stop
Communism taking hold of the world, we must deal
with corruption, bribery, drink, and womanizing.
If we want to change corrupt people we must be
honest ourselves. That is what impresses me very
much at Caux. With this ideology you are bound to
succeed.”
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahat
ma, said at Caux, “The issue for the world is not
Communism or war, but whether statesmen will
undertake the Moi’al Re-Armament of the Com
munist and non-Communist worlds. We must go
to Washington and Moscow with an ideology that
changes men. That is the next step for the Com
munist and non-Communist alike. Unless we
change human nature we can never fulfil the as
pirations of the millions in our countries.”
An Asian center for Moral Re-Armament will
open next spring near Tokyo to match the centers
of Caux and Mackinac. An Assembly for the Amer
icas is being held in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Over Christmas and New Year thei’e will be a Pan-
African Assembly for Moral Re-Armament at the
heart of Africa.
Mr. Khrushchev wants to see a diffex’ent kind
of world. Every honest person knows he is right
in the conviction that change is needed, however
much we disagi’ee with his way of doing it. The
leaders of the free world have in Moral Re-Arma
ment an ideology superior to Communism to offer
him. Even the most difficult will respond to the
firm, united but humble voice of democratic
nations morally rearmed. Why should there be
catastrophe again when with God renaissance is
inevitable ?
It is not a matter of left or right: it is a matter
of right or wrong.
Communism gave its philosophy to the world
last Christmas over the Moscow Radio when it
said: “Our x’ocket has by-passed the moon. It is
nearing the sun and we have not discovered God.
We have turned lights out in heaven that no man
will be able to put on again. We are breaking the
yoke of the Gospel, the opium of the masses. Let
us go forth and Chx’ist shall be relegated to myth
ology.”
Frank Buchman, in his last words, gave a
challenge to the modern world on the sixth of
August in Fi’eudenstadt when he said, “I want the
world to be governed by men governed by God.
Why not let God run the whole world ?”
It is the hour for heroic decision and embold
ened leadex’ship.
Choose ye lids day whom ye will serve.

World Assembly at Caux this year when he said,
“We need a tidal wave of Moral Re-Armament to
sweep across the world. Then men in Government
will be forced to make the right decisions that
spring not only from the intellect, but from our
hearts and faith.”
THE TIDE OF COMMUNISM
CAN BE TURNED
This tidal wave is flooding across the conti
nents. Marshal Tavora, national hero of Brazil,
flew last week to Rome. There he told leaders of
the Church and State, “With Moral Re-Armament
the tide of Communism in my country and Latin
America can be turned.”
His colleague General Bethlem, former Brazil
ian Ambassador in Bolivia and Pakistan, on that
same day was meeting in Los Angeles with Mr.
Kishi, Prime Minister of Japan until last year.
Both General Bethlem and Mr. Kishi had been at
Caux two weeks before. The General said, “In
Brazil and Peru 900,000 of my countrymen have
seen the Japanese play The Tiger. In the last five
months millions more have seen it on television. Its
message has already saved Brazil from civil war.”
He was referring to a play by the revolution
ary students of the Zengakuren of Japan. These
students led the riots in Tokyo last year w'hich
caused President Eisenhower’s visit to Japan to
be canceled. The students changed. They wrote a
play describing how Communism had captured
them through their own moral compromise and
how Moral Re-Armament had taught them to go
not right, not left, but straight. Then they went
to America and apologized to Eisenhower. He
urged them to go to Latin America.

In Manaus, a Communist stronghold of Brazil,
a thousand miles up the Amazon River, 90,000 peo
ple in one night alone saw a presentation of The
Tiger in the football stadium. On the same night
the Communist counter-rally across the road for
the anniversary of Castro’s Cuban revolution drew
a total of 40 people. One of the students said, “It
is the greatest event that has ever taken place in
Manaus. It has revolutionized our thinking.”
THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE
CRISIS IN BERLIN
Mr. Kishi, speaking with General Bethlem in
Los Angeles, told of how he had discussed with Gen
eral Eisenhower last week at Gettysburg the im
pact of the work of Moral Re-Armament through
out the South American continent. He said, “I
apologized to General Eisenhower for last year’s
riots and invited him to come as soon as possible
to Japan. 1 had two objectives in making my pres
ent journey around the world. The first was to
attend the Moi’al Re-Armament Assembly at Caux.
This Assembly made an impression on me that is
both deep and unforgettable. Secondly, I wanted
to meet again the world statesmen I had known
as Prime Minister. The only answer to the crisis in
Berlin and the challenge of Communism today is
the ideology of Moral Re-Armament. Nations to
day must form a solid front, a unity of purpose
and of spirit so evident to the Communist world
that they will not indulge in miscalculation nor
misunderstand our aim and goal. MRA is producing
this unity which transcends all national boundaries
and all minor divisions.”
In September Mr. Saburo Chiba, for three
years Chairman of the National Security Commit
tee of the Japanese Diet, flew straight from Caux
to confer with President Prado of Peru. He said
that his own experience as head of Security had
led him to two conclusions on how to answer Com
munism: (1) To impact the masses with a more
effective ideology and (2) To unite the countries of
the free world in a common strategy.
He told the President that no exclusively na
tional plan is adequate today. While the 13 Com
munist bloc countries are united in one global
strategy, 82 nations have not yet reached a com
mon mind and goal “in order to create a united
force in the free world.” He continued, “We must
create a united force of parliamentarians from
every nation. This is already being done in many
of the free countries.”

Former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi of Japan
TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IN PERU
President Prado invited Moral Re-Armament
to his country “to save democracy in Peru.” At
the National Stadium in Lima 60,000 people stood
in silence for a minute to honor the memory of
Frank Buchman, initiator of Moral Re-Armament,
before seeing a performance of The Tiger. Ten
thousand who could not get in listened over the
loudspeakers outside.
A force of these Japanese students went to San
Marcos University. This is the University which
organized the stoning of Vice President Nixon when
he visited Peru. Speaking on the Peruvian National
Radio after meeting the Japanese, one of these
student leaders said, “Five days ago we had riots.
Moral Re-Armament has made us understand that
the divisions which exist between political groups
arise because each group is out for itself. MRA
has come at the right moment to Peru.”
Another student leader said on the National
Radio: “In this atomic age man must give the
answer to exploitation by either Communism or
capitalism. Here is an ideology which rebuilds the
chaotic world today, which gives food to the
hungry, work to the unemployed and nils the empty
spirit of man which has been lost in immorality
and corruption.”
This week in Peru 40,000 people, including
thousands of Indians in colorful dress, thronged
to the great Sacsayhuaman fortress, stronghold of
the ancient Inca civilization, now known as the Mos
cow of Peru, to see The Tiger and hear it in the
original Inca language. The head of Indian affairs
said, “Your philosophy is going to change the face
of the earth bringing justice, bread and an
answer.”
The Moral Re-Armament force in Latin
America is moving from Brazil and Peru to Chile,
Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries of that con
tinent.
IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE
IN EUROPE
At the same time a force of 400 from 36
nations is sweeping through countries of Europe
in an ideological offensive to answer defeatism,
Communism and division. Among them are fifty
Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World
War II. General Ho Y r ing-chin said, “We lost the
mainland of China because we lacked an ideology.
The materialism in our own life was exploited by
Prime Minister U Nu of Burma
the Communists to take over China. We sacrificed
our country for our selfishness. I have been more
than thirty years a soldier, and I say that the way
to secure peace and freedom for the world is Moral
Re-Armament.”
These fifty Chinese have put their burning
convictions into a play called The Dragon, which
shows the tragedy of a nation lost through the
selfishness of men and gives the hope of an answer.
One of the leading industrialists of Europe,
after seeing The Dragon, said, “Nobody who sees
this play can be the same again. What I like most
about Moral Re-Armament is that it challenges the
rich, as it does everybody, to change their whole
motive of life.”
The former Comintern delegate, Hans Bjerk
holt, co-founder of the Norwegian Communist
Party, spoke last week to 22,000 people at a mass
demonstration with the Chinese play, The Dragon,
in the football stadium at Lucerne. “We are at the
most serious point in the history of mankind,” he
said, “when the leaders of the West start to waver
before Khrushchev. Our task is to move the masses
and give them courage to stand firm. MRA is the
superior ideology that has the power to unite East
and West. It is the next step forward for Com
munist and non-Communist alike.”
Gabriel Marcel, the French philosopher and
playwright, said at Lucerne, “Moral Re-Armament
is an immense effort to create a new living fabric
of humanity right across the world. In France to
day more and more men are responding to this
road.”
Vaterland, Swiss Catholic newspaper, wrote
of The Dragon, “Thus far the Chinese have been
the main agents of world Communism on many
fronts in Africa and South America. Now for the
first time in the history of the ideological struggle
representatives of Free China have appeared on
the scene, blazing a trail with their message. We
wei’e literally shaken as the play unfolded before
our eyes —a play that ends with a brilliant finale
as men realize that the power of the ideology of
Moral Re-Armament can usher in a new and bet
ter age. We made our way home with a great hope
in our hearts.”
The Moral Re-Armament force and the Chin
ese are being greeted by crowds of thousands night
after night who say that in their message they see
hope for peace in the world and the unity of
Europe. Civic leaders of Berlin ax’e among those
who have invited this force to their city. They be
lieve that the x’oot problem is not a wall that divides
a city or a continent but the steely selfishness that
separates man from man and all men from the gov
ernment of God.
Many African countries have invited the
forces of Mox-al Re-Ax’mament to come immedi
ately to their continent. President Kasavubu sent
his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
Africa. If the Congo goes Communist, all Africa
will follow. It is not enough to give dollars to un
derdeveloped countries. We must win the hearts
of the people. What we need is an ideology. That
ideology is Moral Re-Armament.” He told mox’e
than a thousand delegates from evex’y part of the
world that in the last twelve montlxs 483 I’adio
broadcasts about Moi'al Re-Armament have gone
out in five Congolese languages to all parts of his
country on the National Radio.
MORAL RE ARMAMENT OR
FINAL ANNIHILATION
U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, brought a
delegation of his countrymen to Caux last month.
On leaving he said, “Moral Re-Armament must go
on for ever if we want to prevent mankind from
plunging into final annihilation. If we want to stop
Communism taking hold of the world, we must deal
with corruption, bribery, drink, and womanizing.
If we want to change corrupt people we must be
honest ourselves. That is what impresses me very
much at Caux. With this ideology you are bound to
succeed.”
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahat
ma, said at Caux, “The issue for the world is not
Communism or war, but whether statesmen will
undertake the Moi’al Re-Armament of the Com
munist and non-Communist worlds. We must go
to Washington and Moscow with an ideology that
changes men. That is the next step for the Com
munist and non-Communist alike. Unless we
change human nature we can never fulfil the as
pirations of the millions in our countries.”
An Asian center for Moral Re-Armament will
open next spring near Tokyo to match the centers
of Caux and Mackinac. An Assembly for the Amer
icas is being held in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Over Christmas and New Year thei’e will be a Pan-
African Assembly for Moral Re-Armament at the
heart of Africa.
Mr. Khrushchev wants to see a diffex’ent kind
of world. Every honest person knows he is right
in the conviction that change is needed, however
much we disagi’ee with his way of doing it. The
leaders of the free world have in Moral Re-Arma
ment an ideology superior to Communism to offer
him. Even the most difficult will respond to the
firm, united but humble voice of democratic
nations morally rearmed. Why should there be
catastrophe again when with God renaissance is
inevitable ?
It is not a matter of left or right: it is a matter
of right or wrong.
Communism gave its philosophy to the world
last Christmas over the Moscow Radio when it
said: “Our x’ocket has by-passed the moon. It is
nearing the sun and we have not discovered God.
We have turned lights out in heaven that no man
will be able to put on again. We are breaking the
yoke of the Gospel, the opium of the masses. Let
us go forth and Chx’ist shall be relegated to myth
ology.”
Frank Buchman, in his last words, gave a
challenge to the modern world on the sixth of
August in Fi’eudenstadt when he said, “I want the
world to be governed by men governed by God.
Why not let God run the whole world ?”
It is the hour for heroic decision and embold
ened leadex’ship.
Choose ye lids day whom ye will serve.

MORAL RE-ARMAMENT
A TIDAL WAVE OF HOPE
MR. KHRUSHCHEV is 67. He plans to see
the Red Flag flying over every country in
the world during his lifetime. He thinks he can do
it. Every decision and action he takes over Berlin,
Laos, the Congo or at the United Nations is meas
ured against this one aim.
He has an ideology.
Nations outside the Communist bloc lack any
common ideology or world aim. They are divided
amongst themselves. They think that if they stand
up to Mr. Khrushchev they may be forced into
atomic war.
Appeasement is no answer to dictatorship.
The idealism of the United Nations without an
ideology often becomes the tool for Moscow’s aim.
Making big speeches to satisfy public opinion at
home and backing them by weak action when we
meet the Communists at the conference table
destroys the faith of the millions in the power of
the democratic way of life. Squatting in the streets,
however sincere, is no answer to the threat of the
H-bomb.
The answer is to stand up and fight in every
nation, everywhere, for an ideology that changes
Communist and non-Communist alike and unites
every race, class and color in the supreme task of
the century—the remaking of the world.
Men with an ideology superior to Communism
can not only stand up to Mr. Khrushchev but enlist
him in a greater revolution.
General Carpentier of France who was in
command of the land forces of NATO for Central
Europe and who had the training of the Brazilian
Army and commanded the French forces in Indo
china and elsewhere, put the issue clearly at the

In Manaus, a Communist stronghold of Brazil,
a thousand miles up the Amazon River, 90,000 peo
ple in one night alone saw a presentation of The
Tiger in the football stadium. On the same night
the Communist counter-rally across the road for
the anniversary of Castro’s Cuban revolution drew

THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE
CRISIS IN BERLIN
Mr. Kishi, speaking with General Bethlem in
Los Angeles, told of how he had discussed with Gen
eral Eisenhower last week at Gettysburg the im
pact of the work of Moral Re-Armament through
out the South American continent. He said, “I
apologized to General Eisenhower for last year’s
riots and invited him to come as soon as possible
to Japan. 1 had two objectives in making my pres
ent journey around the world. The first was to
attend the Moi’al Re-Armament Assembly at Caux.
This Assembly made an impression on me that is
both deep and unforgettable. Secondly, I wanted
to meet again the world statesmen I had known
as Prime Minister. The only answer to the crisis in
Berlin and the challenge of Communism today is
the ideology of Moral Re-Armament. Nations to
day must form a solid front, a unity of purpose
and of spirit so evident to the Communist world
that they will not indulge in miscalculation nor
misunderstand our aim and goal. MRA is producing
this unity which transcends all national boundaries
and all minor divisions.”
In September Mr. Saburo Chiba, for three
years Chairman of the National Security Commit
tee of the Japanese Diet, flew straight from Caux
to confer with President Prado of Peru. He said
that his own experience as head of Security had
led him to two conclusions on how to answer Com
munism: (1) To impact the masses with a more
effective ideology and (2) To unite the countries of
the free world in a common strategy.
He told the President that no exclusively na
tional plan is adequate today. While the 13 Com
munist bloc countries are united in one global
strategy, 82 nations have not yet reached a com
mon mind and goal “in order to create a united
force in the free world.” He continued, “We must
create a united force of parliamentarians from
every nation. This is already being done in many
of the free countries.”

Former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi of Japan
TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IN PERU
President Prado invited Moral Re-Armament
to his country “to save democracy in Peru.” At
the National Stadium in Lima 60,000 people stood
in silence for a minute to honor the memory of
Frank Buchman, initiator of Moral Re-Armament,
before seeing a performance of The Tiger. Ten
thousand who could not get in listened over the
loudspeakers outside.
A force of these Japanese students went to San
Marcos University. This is the University which
organized the stoning of Vice President Nixon when
he visited Peru. Speaking on the Peruvian National
Radio after meeting the Japanese, one of these
student leaders said, “Five days ago we had riots.
Moral Re-Armament has made us understand that
the divisions which exist between political groups
arise because each group is out for itself. MRA
has come at the right moment to Peru.”
Another student leader said on the National
Radio: “In this atomic age man must give the
answer to exploitation by either Communism or
capitalism. Here is an ideology which rebuilds the
chaotic world today, which gives food to the
hungry, work to the unemployed and nils the empty
spirit of man which has been lost in immorality
and corruption.”
This week in Peru 40,000 people, including
thousands of Indians in colorful dress, thronged
to the great Sacsayhuaman fortress, stronghold of
the ancient Inca civilization, now known as the Mos
cow of Peru, to see The Tiger and hear it in the
original Inca language. The head of Indian affairs
said, “Your philosophy is going to change the face
of the earth bringing justice, bread and an
answer.”
The Moral Re-Armament force in Latin
America is moving from Brazil and Peru to Chile,
Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries of that con
tinent.
IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE
IN EUROPE
At the same time a force of 400 from 36
nations is sweeping through countries of Europe
in an ideological offensive to answer defeatism,
Communism and division. Among them are fifty
Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World
War II. General Ho Y r ing-chin said, “We lost the
mainland of China because we lacked an ideology.
The materialism in our own life was exploited by
Prime Minister U Nu of Burma
the Communists to take over China. We sacrificed
our country for our selfishness. I have been more
than thirty years a soldier, and I say that the way
to secure peace and freedom for the world is Moral
Re-Armament.”
These fifty Chinese have put their burning
convictions into a play called The Dragon, which
shows the tragedy of a nation lost through the
selfishness of men and gives the hope of an answer.
One of the leading industrialists of Europe,
after seeing The Dragon, said, “Nobody who sees
this play can be the same again. What I like most
about Moral Re-Armament is that it challenges the
rich, as it does everybody, to change their whole
motive of life.”
The former Comintern delegate, Hans Bjerk
holt, co-founder of the Norwegian Communist
Party, spoke last week to 22,000 people at a mass
demonstration with the Chinese play, The Dragon,
in the football stadium at Lucerne. “We are at the
most serious point in the history of mankind,” he
said, “when the leaders of the West start to waver
before Khrushchev. Our task is to move the masses
and give them courage to stand firm. MRA is the
superior ideology that has the power to unite East
and West. It is the next step forward for Com
munist and non-Communist alike.”
Gabriel Marcel, the French philosopher and
playwright, said at Lucerne, “Moral Re-Armament
is an immense effort to create a new living fabric
of humanity right across the world. In France to
day more and more men are responding to this
road.”
Vaterland, Swiss Catholic newspaper, wrote
of The Dragon, “Thus far the Chinese have been
the main agents of world Communism on many
fronts in Africa and South America. Now for the
first time in the history of the ideological struggle
representatives of Free China have appeared on
the scene, blazing a trail with their message. We
wei’e literally shaken as the play unfolded before
our eyes —a play that ends with a brilliant finale
as men realize that the power of the ideology of
Moral Re-Armament can usher in a new and bet
ter age. We made our way home with a great hope
in our hearts.”
The Moral Re-Armament force and the Chin
ese are being greeted by crowds of thousands night
after night who say that in their message they see
hope for peace in the world and the unity of
Europe. Civic leaders of Berlin ax’e among those
who have invited this force to their city. They be
lieve that the x’oot problem is not a wall that divides
a city or a continent but the steely selfishness that
separates man from man and all men from the gov
ernment of God.
Many African countries have invited the
forces of Mox-al Re-Ax’mament to come immedi
ately to their continent. President Kasavubu sent
his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
Africa. If the Congo goes Communist, all Africa
will follow. It is not enough to give dollars to un
derdeveloped countries. We must win the hearts
of the people. What we need is an ideology. That
ideology is Moral Re-Armament.” He told mox’e
than a thousand delegates from evex’y part of the
world that in the last twelve montlxs 483 I’adio
broadcasts about Moi'al Re-Armament have gone
out in five Congolese languages to all parts of his
country on the National Radio.
MORAL RE ARMAMENT OR
FINAL ANNIHILATION
U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, brought a
delegation of his countrymen to Caux last month.
On leaving he said, “Moral Re-Armament must go
on for ever if we want to prevent mankind from
plunging into final annihilation. If we want to stop
Communism taking hold of the world, we must deal
with corruption, bribery, drink, and womanizing.
If we want to change corrupt people we must be
honest ourselves. That is what impresses me very
much at Caux. With this ideology you are bound to
succeed.”
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahat
ma, said at Caux, “The issue for the world is not
Communism or war, but whether statesmen will
undertake the Moi’al Re-Armament of the Com
munist and non-Communist worlds. We must go
to Washington and Moscow with an ideology that
changes men. That is the next step for the Com
munist and non-Communist alike. Unless we
change human nature we can never fulfil the as
pirations of the millions in our countries.”
An Asian center for Moral Re-Armament will
open next spring near Tokyo to match the centers
of Caux and Mackinac. An Assembly for the Amer
icas is being held in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Over Christmas and New Year thei’e will be a Pan-
African Assembly for Moral Re-Armament at the
heart of Africa.
Mr. Khrushchev wants to see a diffex’ent kind
of world. Every honest person knows he is right
in the conviction that change is needed, however
much we disagi’ee with his way of doing it. The
leaders of the free world have in Moral Re-Arma
ment an ideology superior to Communism to offer
him. Even the most difficult will respond to the
firm, united but humble voice of democratic
nations morally rearmed. Why should there be
catastrophe again when with God renaissance is
inevitable ?
It is not a matter of left or right: it is a matter
of right or wrong.
Communism gave its philosophy to the world
last Christmas over the Moscow Radio when it
said: “Our x’ocket has by-passed the moon. It is
nearing the sun and we have not discovered God.
We have turned lights out in heaven that no man
will be able to put on again. We are breaking the
yoke of the Gospel, the opium of the masses. Let
us go forth and Chx’ist shall be relegated to myth
ology.”
Frank Buchman, in his last words, gave a
challenge to the modern world on the sixth of
August in Fi’eudenstadt when he said, “I want the
world to be governed by men governed by God.
Why not let God run the whole world ?”
It is the hour for heroic decision and embold
ened leadex’ship.
Choose ye lids day whom ye will serve.

MORAL RE-ARMAMENT
A TIDAL WAVE OF HOPE
MR. KHRUSHCHEV is 67. He plans to see
the Red Flag flying over every country in
the world during his lifetime. He thinks he can do
it. Every decision and action he takes over Berlin,
Laos, the Congo or at the United Nations is meas
ured against this one aim.
He has an ideology.
Nations outside the Communist bloc lack any
common ideology or world aim. They are divided
amongst themselves. They think that if they stand
up to Mr. Khrushchev they may be forced into
atomic war.
Appeasement is no answer to dictatorship.
The idealism of the United Nations without an
ideology often becomes the tool for Moscow’s aim.
Making big speeches to satisfy public opinion at
home and backing them by weak action when we
meet the Communists at the conference table
destroys the faith of the millions in the power of
the democratic way of life. Squatting in the streets,
however sincere, is no answer to the threat of the
H-bomb.
The answer is to stand up and fight in every
nation, everywhere, for an ideology that changes
Communist and non-Communist alike and unites
every race, class and color in the supreme task of
the century—the remaking of the world.
Men with an ideology superior to Communism
can not only stand up to Mr. Khrushchev but enlist
him in a greater revolution.
General Carpentier of France who was in
command of the land forces of NATO for Central
Europe and who had the training of the Brazilian
Army and commanded the French forces in Indo
china and elsewhere, put the issue clearly at the
World Assembly at Caux this year when he said,
“We need a tidal wave of Moral Re-Armament to
sweep across the world. Then men in Government
will be forced to make the right decisions that
spring not only from the intellect, but from our
hearts and faith.”
THE TIDE OF COMMUNISM
CAN BE TURNED
This tidal wave is flooding across the conti
nents. Marshal Tavora, national hero of Brazil,
flew last week to Rome. There he told leaders of
the Church and State, “With Moral Re-Armament
the tide of Communism in my country and Latin
America can be turned.”
His colleague General Bethlem, former Brazil
ian Ambassador in Bolivia and Pakistan, on that
same day was meeting in Los Angeles with Mr.
Kishi, Prime Minister of Japan until last year.
Both General Bethlem and Mr. Kishi had been at
Caux two weeks before. The General said, “In
Brazil and Peru 900,000 of my countrymen have
seen the Japanese play The Tiger. In the last five
months millions more have seen it on television. Its
message has already saved Brazil from civil war.”
He was referring to a play by the revolution
ary students of the Zengakuren of Japan. These
students led the riots in Tokyo last year w'hich
caused President Eisenhower’s visit to Japan to
be canceled. The students changed. They wrote a
play describing how Communism had captured
them through their own moral compromise and
how Moral Re-Armament had taught them to go
not right, not left, but straight. Then they went
to America and apologized to Eisenhower. He
urged them to go to Latin America.

that they will not indulge in miscalculation nor
misunderstand our aim and goal. MRA is producing
this unity which transcends all national boundaries
and all minor divisions.”
In September Mr. Saburo Chiba, for three
years Chairman of the National Security Commit
tee of the Japanese Diet, flew straight from Caux
to confer with President Prado of Peru. He said
that his own experience as head of Security had
led him to two conclusions on how to answer Com
munism: (1) To impact the masses with a more
effective ideology and (2) To unite the countries of
the free world in a common strategy.
He told the President that no exclusively na
tional plan is adequate today. While the 13 Com
munist bloc countries are united in one global
strategy, 82 nations have not yet reached a com
mon mind and goal “in order to create a united
force in the free world.” He continued, “We must
create a united force of parliamentarians from
every nation. This is already being done in many
of the free countries.”

Former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi of Japan
TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IN PERU
President Prado invited Moral Re-Armament
to his country “to save democracy in Peru.” At
the National Stadium in Lima 60,000 people stood
in silence for a minute to honor the memory of
Frank Buchman, initiator of Moral Re-Armament,
before seeing a performance of The Tiger. Ten
thousand who could not get in listened over the
loudspeakers outside.
A force of these Japanese students went to San
Marcos University. This is the University which
organized the stoning of Vice President Nixon when
he visited Peru. Speaking on the Peruvian National
Radio after meeting the Japanese, one of these
student leaders said, “Five days ago we had riots.
Moral Re-Armament has made us understand that
the divisions which exist between political groups
arise because each group is out for itself. MRA
has come at the right moment to Peru.”
Another student leader said on the National
Radio: “In this atomic age man must give the
answer to exploitation by either Communism or
capitalism. Here is an ideology which rebuilds the
chaotic world today, which gives food to the
hungry, work to the unemployed and nils the empty
spirit of man which has been lost in immorality
and corruption.”
This week in Peru 40,000 people, including
thousands of Indians in colorful dress, thronged
to the great Sacsayhuaman fortress, stronghold of
the ancient Inca civilization, now known as the Mos
cow of Peru, to see The Tiger and hear it in the
original Inca language. The head of Indian affairs
said, “Your philosophy is going to change the face
of the earth bringing justice, bread and an
answer.”
The Moral Re-Armament force in Latin
America is moving from Brazil and Peru to Chile,
Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries of that con
tinent.
IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE
IN EUROPE
At the same time a force of 400 from 36
nations is sweeping through countries of Europe
in an ideological offensive to answer defeatism,
Communism and division. Among them are fifty
Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World
War II. General Ho Y r ing-chin said, “We lost the
mainland of China because we lacked an ideology.
The materialism in our own life was exploited by
Prime Minister U Nu of Burma
the Communists to take over China. We sacrificed
our country for our selfishness. I have been more
than thirty years a soldier, and I say that the way
to secure peace and freedom for the world is Moral
Re-Armament.”
These fifty Chinese have put their burning
convictions into a play called The Dragon, which
shows the tragedy of a nation lost through the
selfishness of men and gives the hope of an answer.
One of the leading industrialists of Europe,
after seeing The Dragon, said, “Nobody who sees
this play can be the same again. What I like most
about Moral Re-Armament is that it challenges the
rich, as it does everybody, to change their whole
motive of life.”
The former Comintern delegate, Hans Bjerk
holt, co-founder of the Norwegian Communist
Party, spoke last week to 22,000 people at a mass
demonstration with the Chinese play, The Dragon,
in the football stadium at Lucerne. “We are at the
most serious point in the history of mankind,” he
said, “when the leaders of the West start to waver
before Khrushchev. Our task is to move the masses
and give them courage to stand firm. MRA is the
superior ideology that has the power to unite East
and West. It is the next step forward for Com
munist and non-Communist alike.”
Gabriel Marcel, the French philosopher and
playwright, said at Lucerne, “Moral Re-Armament
is an immense effort to create a new living fabric
of humanity right across the world. In France to
day more and more men are responding to this
road.”
Vaterland, Swiss Catholic newspaper, wrote
of The Dragon, “Thus far the Chinese have been
the main agents of world Communism on many
fronts in Africa and South America. Now for the
first time in the history of the ideological struggle
representatives of Free China have appeared on
the scene, blazing a trail with their message. We
wei’e literally shaken as the play unfolded before
our eyes —a play that ends with a brilliant finale
as men realize that the power of the ideology of
Moral Re-Armament can usher in a new and bet
ter age. We made our way home with a great hope
in our hearts.”
The Moral Re-Armament force and the Chin
ese are being greeted by crowds of thousands night
after night who say that in their message they see
hope for peace in the world and the unity of
Europe. Civic leaders of Berlin ax’e among those
who have invited this force to their city. They be
lieve that the x’oot problem is not a wall that divides
a city or a continent but the steely selfishness that
separates man from man and all men from the gov
ernment of God.
Many African countries have invited the
forces of Mox-al Re-Ax’mament to come immedi
ately to their continent. President Kasavubu sent
his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
Africa. If the Congo goes Communist, all Africa
will follow. It is not enough to give dollars to un
derdeveloped countries. We must win the hearts
of the people. What we need is an ideology. That
ideology is Moral Re-Armament.” He told mox’e
than a thousand delegates from evex’y part of the
world that in the last twelve montlxs 483 I’adio
broadcasts about Moi'al Re-Armament have gone
out in five Congolese languages to all parts of his
country on the National Radio.
MORAL RE ARMAMENT OR
FINAL ANNIHILATION
U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, brought a
delegation of his countrymen to Caux last month.
On leaving he said, “Moral Re-Armament must go
on for ever if we want to prevent mankind from
plunging into final annihilation. If we want to stop
Communism taking hold of the world, we must deal
with corruption, bribery, drink, and womanizing.
If we want to change corrupt people we must be
honest ourselves. That is what impresses me very
much at Caux. With this ideology you are bound to
succeed.”
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahat
ma, said at Caux, “The issue for the world is not
Communism or war, but whether statesmen will
undertake the Moi’al Re-Armament of the Com
munist and non-Communist worlds. We must go
to Washington and Moscow with an ideology that
changes men. That is the next step for the Com
munist and non-Communist alike. Unless we
change human nature we can never fulfil the as
pirations of the millions in our countries.”
An Asian center for Moral Re-Armament will
open next spring near Tokyo to match the centers
of Caux and Mackinac. An Assembly for the Amer
icas is being held in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Over Christmas and New Year thei’e will be a Pan-
African Assembly for Moral Re-Armament at the
heart of Africa.
Mr. Khrushchev wants to see a diffex’ent kind
of world. Every honest person knows he is right
in the conviction that change is needed, however
much we disagi’ee with his way of doing it. The
leaders of the free world have in Moral Re-Arma
ment an ideology superior to Communism to offer
him. Even the most difficult will respond to the
firm, united but humble voice of democratic
nations morally rearmed. Why should there be
catastrophe again when with God renaissance is
inevitable ?
It is not a matter of left or right: it is a matter
of right or wrong.
Communism gave its philosophy to the world
last Christmas over the Moscow Radio when it
said: “Our x’ocket has by-passed the moon. It is
nearing the sun and we have not discovered God.
We have turned lights out in heaven that no man
will be able to put on again. We are breaking the
yoke of the Gospel, the opium of the masses. Let
us go forth and Chx’ist shall be relegated to myth
ology.”
Frank Buchman, in his last words, gave a
challenge to the modern world on the sixth of
August in Fi’eudenstadt when he said, “I want the
world to be governed by men governed by God.
Why not let God run the whole world ?”
It is the hour for heroic decision and embold
ened leadex’ship.
Choose ye lids day whom ye will serve.

MORAL RE-ARMAMENT
A TIDAL WAVE OF HOPE
MR. KHRUSHCHEV is 67. He plans to see
the Red Flag flying over every country in
the world during his lifetime. He thinks he can do
it. Every decision and action he takes over Berlin,
Laos, the Congo or at the United Nations is meas
ured against this one aim.
He has an ideology.
Nations outside the Communist bloc lack any
common ideology or world aim. They are divided
amongst themselves. They think that if they stand
up to Mr. Khrushchev they may be forced into
atomic war.
Appeasement is no answer to dictatorship.
The idealism of the United Nations without an
ideology often becomes the tool for Moscow’s aim.
Making big speeches to satisfy public opinion at
home and backing them by weak action when we
meet the Communists at the conference table
destroys the faith of the millions in the power of
the democratic way of life. Squatting in the streets,
however sincere, is no answer to the threat of the
H-bomb.
The answer is to stand up and fight in every
nation, everywhere, for an ideology that changes
Communist and non-Communist alike and unites
every race, class and color in the supreme task of
the century—the remaking of the world.
Men with an ideology superior to Communism
can not only stand up to Mr. Khrushchev but enlist
him in a greater revolution.
General Carpentier of France who was in
command of the land forces of NATO for Central
Europe and who had the training of the Brazilian
Army and commanded the French forces in Indo
china and elsewhere, put the issue clearly at the
World Assembly at Caux this year when he said,
“We need a tidal wave of Moral Re-Armament to
sweep across the world. Then men in Government
will be forced to make the right decisions that
spring not only from the intellect, but from our
hearts and faith.”
THE TIDE OF COMMUNISM
CAN BE TURNED
This tidal wave is flooding across the conti
nents. Marshal Tavora, national hero of Brazil,
flew last week to Rome. There he told leaders of
the Church and State, “With Moral Re-Armament
the tide of Communism in my country and Latin
America can be turned.”
His colleague General Bethlem, former Brazil
ian Ambassador in Bolivia and Pakistan, on that
same day was meeting in Los Angeles with Mr.
Kishi, Prime Minister of Japan until last year.
Both General Bethlem and Mr. Kishi had been at
Caux two weeks before. The General said, “In
Brazil and Peru 900,000 of my countrymen have
seen the Japanese play The Tiger. In the last five
months millions more have seen it on television. Its
message has already saved Brazil from civil war.”
He was referring to a play by the revolution
ary students of the Zengakuren of Japan. These
students led the riots in Tokyo last year w'hich
caused President Eisenhower’s visit to Japan to
be canceled. The students changed. They wrote a
play describing how Communism had captured
them through their own moral compromise and
how Moral Re-Armament had taught them to go
not right, not left, but straight. Then they went
to America and apologized to Eisenhower. He
urged them to go to Latin America.

the Communist counter-rally across the road for
the anniversary of Castro’s Cuban revolution drew
a total of 40 people. One of the students said, “It

Manaus. It has revolutionized our thinking.”

Mr. Kishi, speaking with General Bethlem in

pact of the work of Moral Re-Armament through
out the South American continent. He said, “I
apologized to General Eisenhower for last year’s
riots and invited him to come as soon as possible
to Japan. 1 had two objectives in making my pres

This Assembly made an impression on me that is
both deep and unforgettable. Secondly, I wanted
to meet again the world statesmen I had known
as Prime Minister. The only answer to the crisis in
Berlin and the challenge of Communism today is
the ideology of Moral Re-Armament. Nations to

A force of these Japanese students went to San
Marcos University. This is the University which
organized the stoning of Vice President Nixon when
he visited Peru. Speaking on the Peruvian National
Radio after meeting the Japanese, one of these
student leaders said, “Five days ago we had riots.
Moral Re-Armament has made us understand that
the divisions which exist between political groups
arise because each group is out for itself. MRA
has come at the right moment to Peru.”
Another student leader said on the National
Radio: “In this atomic age man must give the
answer to exploitation by either Communism or
capitalism. Here is an ideology which rebuilds the
chaotic world today, which gives food to the
hungry, work to the unemployed and nils the empty
spirit of man which has been lost in immorality
and corruption.”
This week in Peru 40,000 people, including
thousands of Indians in colorful dress, thronged
to the great Sacsayhuaman fortress, stronghold of
the ancient Inca civilization, now known as the Mos
cow of Peru, to see The Tiger and hear it in the
original Inca language. The head of Indian affairs
said, “Your philosophy is going to change the face
of the earth bringing justice, bread and an
answer.”
The Moral Re-Armament force in Latin
America is moving from Brazil and Peru to Chile,
Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries of that con
tinent.
IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE
IN EUROPE
At the same time a force of 400 from 36
nations is sweeping through countries of Europe
in an ideological offensive to answer defeatism,
Communism and division. Among them are fifty
Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World
War II. General Ho Y r ing-chin said, “We lost the
mainland of China because we lacked an ideology.
The materialism in our own life was exploited by
Prime Minister U Nu of Burma
the Communists to take over China. We sacrificed
our country for our selfishness. I have been more
than thirty years a soldier, and I say that the way
to secure peace and freedom for the world is Moral
Re-Armament.”
These fifty Chinese have put their burning
convictions into a play called The Dragon, which
shows the tragedy of a nation lost through the
selfishness of men and gives the hope of an answer.
One of the leading industrialists of Europe,
after seeing The Dragon, said, “Nobody who sees
this play can be the same again. What I like most
about Moral Re-Armament is that it challenges the
rich, as it does everybody, to change their whole
motive of life.”
The former Comintern delegate, Hans Bjerk
holt, co-founder of the Norwegian Communist
Party, spoke last week to 22,000 people at a mass
demonstration with the Chinese play, The Dragon,
in the football stadium at Lucerne. “We are at the
most serious point in the history of mankind,” he
said, “when the leaders of the West start to waver
before Khrushchev. Our task is to move the masses
and give them courage to stand firm. MRA is the
superior ideology that has the power to unite East
and West. It is the next step forward for Com
munist and non-Communist alike.”
Gabriel Marcel, the French philosopher and
playwright, said at Lucerne, “Moral Re-Armament
is an immense effort to create a new living fabric
of humanity right across the world. In France to
day more and more men are responding to this
road.”
Vaterland, Swiss Catholic newspaper, wrote
of The Dragon, “Thus far the Chinese have been
the main agents of world Communism on many
fronts in Africa and South America. Now for the
first time in the history of the ideological struggle
representatives of Free China have appeared on
the scene, blazing a trail with their message. We
wei’e literally shaken as the play unfolded before
our eyes —a play that ends with a brilliant finale
as men realize that the power of the ideology of
Moral Re-Armament can usher in a new and bet
ter age. We made our way home with a great hope
in our hearts.”
The Moral Re-Armament force and the Chin
ese are being greeted by crowds of thousands night
after night who say that in their message they see
hope for peace in the world and the unity of
Europe. Civic leaders of Berlin ax’e among those
who have invited this force to their city. They be
lieve that the x’oot problem is not a wall that divides
a city or a continent but the steely selfishness that
separates man from man and all men from the gov
ernment of God.
Many African countries have invited the
forces of Mox-al Re-Ax’mament to come immedi
ately to their continent. President Kasavubu sent
his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
Africa. If the Congo goes Communist, all Africa
will follow. It is not enough to give dollars to un
derdeveloped countries. We must win the hearts
of the people. What we need is an ideology. That
ideology is Moral Re-Armament.” He told mox’e
than a thousand delegates from evex’y part of the
world that in the last twelve montlxs 483 I’adio
broadcasts about Moi'al Re-Armament have gone
out in five Congolese languages to all parts of his
country on the National Radio.
MORAL RE ARMAMENT OR
FINAL ANNIHILATION
U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, brought a
delegation of his countrymen to Caux last month.
On leaving he said, “Moral Re-Armament must go
on for ever if we want to prevent mankind from
plunging into final annihilation. If we want to stop
Communism taking hold of the world, we must deal
with corruption, bribery, drink, and womanizing.
If we want to change corrupt people we must be
honest ourselves. That is what impresses me very
much at Caux. With this ideology you are bound to
succeed.”
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahat
ma, said at Caux, “The issue for the world is not
Communism or war, but whether statesmen will
undertake the Moi’al Re-Armament of the Com
munist and non-Communist worlds. We must go
to Washington and Moscow with an ideology that
changes men. That is the next step for the Com
munist and non-Communist alike. Unless we
change human nature we can never fulfil the as
pirations of the millions in our countries.”
An Asian center for Moral Re-Armament will
open next spring near Tokyo to match the centers
of Caux and Mackinac. An Assembly for the Amer
icas is being held in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Over Christmas and New Year thei’e will be a Pan-
African Assembly for Moral Re-Armament at the
heart of Africa.
Mr. Khrushchev wants to see a diffex’ent kind
of world. Every honest person knows he is right
in the conviction that change is needed, however
much we disagi’ee with his way of doing it. The
leaders of the free world have in Moral Re-Arma
ment an ideology superior to Communism to offer
him. Even the most difficult will respond to the
firm, united but humble voice of democratic
nations morally rearmed. Why should there be
catastrophe again when with God renaissance is
inevitable ?
It is not a matter of left or right: it is a matter
of right or wrong.
Communism gave its philosophy to the world
last Christmas over the Moscow Radio when it
said: “Our x’ocket has by-passed the moon. It is
nearing the sun and we have not discovered God.
We have turned lights out in heaven that no man
will be able to put on again. We are breaking the
yoke of the Gospel, the opium of the masses. Let
us go forth and Chx’ist shall be relegated to myth
ology.”
Frank Buchman, in his last words, gave a
challenge to the modern world on the sixth of
August in Fi’eudenstadt when he said, “I want the
world to be governed by men governed by God.
Why not let God run the whole world ?”
It is the hour for heroic decision and embold
ened leadex’ship.
Choose ye lids day whom ye will serve.

MORAL RE-ARMAMENT
A TIDAL WAVE OF HOPE
MR. KHRUSHCHEV is 67. He plans to see
the Red Flag flying over every country in
the world during his lifetime. He thinks he can do
it. Every decision and action he takes over Berlin,
Laos, the Congo or at the United Nations is meas
ured against this one aim.
He has an ideology.
Nations outside the Communist bloc lack any
common ideology or world aim. They are divided
amongst themselves. They think that if they stand
up to Mr. Khrushchev they may be forced into
atomic war.
Appeasement is no answer to dictatorship.
The idealism of the United Nations without an
ideology often becomes the tool for Moscow’s aim.
Making big speeches to satisfy public opinion at
home and backing them by weak action when we
meet the Communists at the conference table
destroys the faith of the millions in the power of
the democratic way of life. Squatting in the streets,
however sincere, is no answer to the threat of the
H-bomb.
The answer is to stand up and fight in every
nation, everywhere, for an ideology that changes
Communist and non-Communist alike and unites
every race, class and color in the supreme task of
the century—the remaking of the world.
Men with an ideology superior to Communism
can not only stand up to Mr. Khrushchev but enlist
him in a greater revolution.
General Carpentier of France who was in
command of the land forces of NATO for Central
Europe and who had the training of the Brazilian
Army and commanded the French forces in Indo
china and elsewhere, put the issue clearly at the
World Assembly at Caux this year when he said,
“We need a tidal wave of Moral Re-Armament to
sweep across the world. Then men in Government
will be forced to make the right decisions that
spring not only from the intellect, but from our
hearts and faith.”
THE TIDE OF COMMUNISM
CAN BE TURNED
This tidal wave is flooding across the conti
nents. Marshal Tavora, national hero of Brazil,
flew last week to Rome. There he told leaders of
the Church and State, “With Moral Re-Armament
the tide of Communism in my country and Latin
America can be turned.”
His colleague General Bethlem, former Brazil
ian Ambassador in Bolivia and Pakistan, on that
same day was meeting in Los Angeles with Mr.
Kishi, Prime Minister of Japan until last year.
Both General Bethlem and Mr. Kishi had been at
Caux two weeks before. The General said, “In
Brazil and Peru 900,000 of my countrymen have
seen the Japanese play The Tiger. In the last five
months millions more have seen it on television. Its
message has already saved Brazil from civil war.”
He was referring to a play by the revolution
ary students of the Zengakuren of Japan. These
students led the riots in Tokyo last year w'hich
caused President Eisenhower’s visit to Japan to
be canceled. The students changed. They wrote a
play describing how Communism had captured
them through their own moral compromise and
how Moral Re-Armament had taught them to go
not right, not left, but straight. Then they went
to America and apologized to Eisenhower. He
urged them to go to Latin America.

In Manaus, a Communist stronghold of Brazil,
a thousand miles up the Amazon River, 90,000 peo

the Communist counter-rally across the road for
the anniversary of Castro’s Cuban revolution drew
a total of 40 people. One of the students said, “It
is the greatest event that has ever taken place in
Manaus. It has revolutionized our thinking.”
THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE
CRISIS IN BERLIN
Mr. Kishi, speaking with General Bethlem in
Los Angeles, told of how he had discussed with Gen
eral Eisenhower last week at Gettysburg the im
pact of the work of Moral Re-Armament through
out the South American continent. He said, “I
apologized to General Eisenhower for last year’s
riots and invited him to come as soon as possible
to Japan. 1 had two objectives in making my pres
ent journey around the world. The first was to
attend the Moi’al Re-Armament Assembly at Caux.
This Assembly made an impression on me that is
both deep and unforgettable. Secondly, I wanted
to meet again the world statesmen I had known
as Prime Minister. The only answer to the crisis in
Berlin and the challenge of Communism today is
the ideology of Moral Re-Armament. Nations to
day must form a solid front, a unity of purpose
and of spirit so evident to the Communist world
that they will not indulge in miscalculation nor
misunderstand our aim and goal. MRA is producing
this unity which transcends all national boundaries
and all minor divisions.”
In September Mr. Saburo Chiba, for three
years Chairman of the National Security Commit
tee of the Japanese Diet, flew straight from Caux
to confer with President Prado of Peru. He said
that his own experience as head of Security had
led him to two conclusions on how to answer Com
munism: (1) To impact the masses with a more
effective ideology and (2) To unite the countries of
the free world in a common strategy.
He told the President that no exclusively na
tional plan is adequate today. While the 13 Com
munist bloc countries are united in one global
strategy, 82 nations have not yet reached a com
mon mind and goal “in order to create a united
force in the free world.” He continued, “We must
create a united force of parliamentarians from
every nation. This is already being done in many
of the free countries.”

Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World
War II. General Ho Y r ing-chin said, “We lost the
mainland of China because we lacked an ideology.
The materialism in our own life was exploited by
Prime Minister U Nu of Burma
the Communists to take over China. We sacrificed
our country for our selfishness. I have been more
than thirty years a soldier, and I say that the way
to secure peace and freedom for the world is Moral
Re-Armament.”
These fifty Chinese have put their burning
convictions into a play called The Dragon, which
shows the tragedy of a nation lost through the
selfishness of men and gives the hope of an answer.
One of the leading industrialists of Europe,
after seeing The Dragon, said, “Nobody who sees
this play can be the same again. What I like most
about Moral Re-Armament is that it challenges the
rich, as it does everybody, to change their whole
motive of life.”
The former Comintern delegate, Hans Bjerk
holt, co-founder of the Norwegian Communist
Party, spoke last week to 22,000 people at a mass
demonstration with the Chinese play, The Dragon,
in the football stadium at Lucerne. “We are at the
most serious point in the history of mankind,” he
said, “when the leaders of the West start to waver
before Khrushchev. Our task is to move the masses
and give them courage to stand firm. MRA is the
superior ideology that has the power to unite East
and West. It is the next step forward for Com
munist and non-Communist alike.”
Gabriel Marcel, the French philosopher and
playwright, said at Lucerne, “Moral Re-Armament
is an immense effort to create a new living fabric
of humanity right across the world. In France to
day more and more men are responding to this
road.”
Vaterland, Swiss Catholic newspaper, wrote
of The Dragon, “Thus far the Chinese have been
the main agents of world Communism on many
fronts in Africa and South America. Now for the
first time in the history of the ideological struggle
representatives of Free China have appeared on
the scene, blazing a trail with their message. We
wei’e literally shaken as the play unfolded before
our eyes —a play that ends with a brilliant finale
as men realize that the power of the ideology of
Moral Re-Armament can usher in a new and bet
ter age. We made our way home with a great hope
in our hearts.”
The Moral Re-Armament force and the Chin
ese are being greeted by crowds of thousands night
after night who say that in their message they see
hope for peace in the world and the unity of
Europe. Civic leaders of Berlin ax’e among those
who have invited this force to their city. They be
lieve that the x’oot problem is not a wall that divides
a city or a continent but the steely selfishness that
separates man from man and all men from the gov
ernment of God.
Many African countries have invited the
forces of Mox-al Re-Ax’mament to come immedi
ately to their continent. President Kasavubu sent
his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
Africa. If the Congo goes Communist, all Africa
will follow. It is not enough to give dollars to un
derdeveloped countries. We must win the hearts
of the people. What we need is an ideology. That
ideology is Moral Re-Armament.” He told mox’e
than a thousand delegates from evex’y part of the
world that in the last twelve montlxs 483 I’adio
broadcasts about Moi'al Re-Armament have gone
out in five Congolese languages to all parts of his
country on the National Radio.
MORAL RE ARMAMENT OR
FINAL ANNIHILATION
U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, brought a
delegation of his countrymen to Caux last month.
On leaving he said, “Moral Re-Armament must go
on for ever if we want to prevent mankind from
plunging into final annihilation. If we want to stop
Communism taking hold of the world, we must deal
with corruption, bribery, drink, and womanizing.
If we want to change corrupt people we must be
honest ourselves. That is what impresses me very
much at Caux. With this ideology you are bound to
succeed.”
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahat
ma, said at Caux, “The issue for the world is not
Communism or war, but whether statesmen will
undertake the Moi’al Re-Armament of the Com
munist and non-Communist worlds. We must go
to Washington and Moscow with an ideology that
changes men. That is the next step for the Com
munist and non-Communist alike. Unless we
change human nature we can never fulfil the as
pirations of the millions in our countries.”
An Asian center for Moral Re-Armament will
open next spring near Tokyo to match the centers
of Caux and Mackinac. An Assembly for the Amer
icas is being held in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Over Christmas and New Year thei’e will be a Pan-
African Assembly for Moral Re-Armament at the
heart of Africa.
Mr. Khrushchev wants to see a diffex’ent kind
of world. Every honest person knows he is right
in the conviction that change is needed, however
much we disagi’ee with his way of doing it. The
leaders of the free world have in Moral Re-Arma
ment an ideology superior to Communism to offer
him. Even the most difficult will respond to the
firm, united but humble voice of democratic
nations morally rearmed. Why should there be
catastrophe again when with God renaissance is
inevitable ?
It is not a matter of left or right: it is a matter
of right or wrong.
Communism gave its philosophy to the world
last Christmas over the Moscow Radio when it
said: “Our x’ocket has by-passed the moon. It is
nearing the sun and we have not discovered God.
We have turned lights out in heaven that no man
will be able to put on again. We are breaking the
yoke of the Gospel, the opium of the masses. Let
us go forth and Chx’ist shall be relegated to myth
ology.”
Frank Buchman, in his last words, gave a
challenge to the modern world on the sixth of
August in Fi’eudenstadt when he said, “I want the
world to be governed by men governed by God.
Why not let God run the whole world ?”
It is the hour for heroic decision and embold
ened leadex’ship.
Choose ye lids day whom ye will serve.

MORAL RE-ARMAMENT
A TIDAL WAVE OF HOPE
MR. KHRUSHCHEV is 67. He plans to see
the Red Flag flying over every country in
the world during his lifetime. He thinks he can do
it. Every decision and action he takes over Berlin,
Laos, the Congo or at the United Nations is meas
ured against this one aim.
He has an ideology.
Nations outside the Communist bloc lack any
common ideology or world aim. They are divided
amongst themselves. They think that if they stand
up to Mr. Khrushchev they may be forced into
atomic war.
Appeasement is no answer to dictatorship.
The idealism of the United Nations without an
ideology often becomes the tool for Moscow’s aim.
Making big speeches to satisfy public opinion at
home and backing them by weak action when we
meet the Communists at the conference table
destroys the faith of the millions in the power of
the democratic way of life. Squatting in the streets,
however sincere, is no answer to the threat of the
H-bomb.
The answer is to stand up and fight in every
nation, everywhere, for an ideology that changes
Communist and non-Communist alike and unites
every race, class and color in the supreme task of
the century—the remaking of the world.
Men with an ideology superior to Communism
can not only stand up to Mr. Khrushchev but enlist
him in a greater revolution.
General Carpentier of France who was in
command of the land forces of NATO for Central
Europe and who had the training of the Brazilian
Army and commanded the French forces in Indo
china and elsewhere, put the issue clearly at the
World Assembly at Caux this year when he said,
“We need a tidal wave of Moral Re-Armament to
sweep across the world. Then men in Government
will be forced to make the right decisions that
spring not only from the intellect, but from our
hearts and faith.”
THE TIDE OF COMMUNISM
CAN BE TURNED
This tidal wave is flooding across the conti
nents. Marshal Tavora, national hero of Brazil,
flew last week to Rome. There he told leaders of
the Church and State, “With Moral Re-Armament
the tide of Communism in my country and Latin
America can be turned.”
His colleague General Bethlem, former Brazil
ian Ambassador in Bolivia and Pakistan, on that
same day was meeting in Los Angeles with Mr.
Kishi, Prime Minister of Japan until last year.
Both General Bethlem and Mr. Kishi had been at
Caux two weeks before. The General said, “In
Brazil and Peru 900,000 of my countrymen have
seen the Japanese play The Tiger. In the last five
months millions more have seen it on television. Its
message has already saved Brazil from civil war.”
He was referring to a play by the revolution
ary students of the Zengakuren of Japan. These
students led the riots in Tokyo last year w'hich
caused President Eisenhower’s visit to Japan to
be canceled. The students changed. They wrote a
play describing how Communism had captured
them through their own moral compromise and
how Moral Re-Armament had taught them to go
not right, not left, but straight. Then they went
to America and apologized to Eisenhower. He
urged them to go to Latin America.

In Manaus, a Communist stronghold of Brazil,
a thousand miles up the Amazon River, 90,000 peo
ple in one night alone saw a presentation of The
Tiger in the football stadium. On the same night
the Communist counter-rally across the road for
the anniversary of Castro’s Cuban revolution drew
a total of 40 people. One of the students said, “It
is the greatest event that has ever taken place in
Manaus. It has revolutionized our thinking.”
THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE
CRISIS IN BERLIN
Mr. Kishi, speaking with General Bethlem in
Los Angeles, told of how he had discussed with Gen
eral Eisenhower last week at Gettysburg the im
pact of the work of Moral Re-Armament through
out the South American continent. He said, “I
apologized to General Eisenhower for last year’s
riots and invited him to come as soon as possible
to Japan. 1 had two objectives in making my pres
ent journey around the world. The first was to
attend the Moi’al Re-Armament Assembly at Caux.
This Assembly made an impression on me that is
both deep and unforgettable. Secondly, I wanted
to meet again the world statesmen I had known
as Prime Minister. The only answer to the crisis in
Berlin and the challenge of Communism today is
the ideology of Moral Re-Armament. Nations to
day must form a solid front, a unity of purpose
and of spirit so evident to the Communist world
that they will not indulge in miscalculation nor
misunderstand our aim and goal. MRA is producing
this unity which transcends all national boundaries
and all minor divisions.”
In September Mr. Saburo Chiba, for three
years Chairman of the National Security Commit
tee of the Japanese Diet, flew straight from Caux
to confer with President Prado of Peru. He said
that his own experience as head of Security had
led him to two conclusions on how to answer Com
munism: (1) To impact the masses with a more
effective ideology and (2) To unite the countries of
the free world in a common strategy.
He told the President that no exclusively na
tional plan is adequate today. While the 13 Com
munist bloc countries are united in one global
strategy, 82 nations have not yet reached a com
mon mind and goal “in order to create a united
force in the free world.” He continued, “We must
create a united force of parliamentarians from
every nation. This is already being done in many
of the free countries.”

Former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi of Japan
TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IN PERU
President Prado invited Moral Re-Armament
to his country “to save democracy in Peru.” At
the National Stadium in Lima 60,000 people stood
in silence for a minute to honor the memory of
Frank Buchman, initiator of Moral Re-Armament,
before seeing a performance of The Tiger. Ten
thousand who could not get in listened over the
loudspeakers outside.
A force of these Japanese students went to San
Marcos University. This is the University which
organized the stoning of Vice President Nixon when
he visited Peru. Speaking on the Peruvian National
Radio after meeting the Japanese, one of these
student leaders said, “Five days ago we had riots.
Moral Re-Armament has made us understand that
the divisions which exist between political groups
arise because each group is out for itself. MRA
has come at the right moment to Peru.”
Another student leader said on the National
Radio: “In this atomic age man must give the
answer to exploitation by either Communism or
capitalism. Here is an ideology which rebuilds the
chaotic world today, which gives food to the
hungry, work to the unemployed and nils the empty
spirit of man which has been lost in immorality
and corruption.”
This week in Peru 40,000 people, including
thousands of Indians in colorful dress, thronged
to the great Sacsayhuaman fortress, stronghold of
the ancient Inca civilization, now known as the Mos
cow of Peru, to see The Tiger and hear it in the
original Inca language. The head of Indian affairs
said, “Your philosophy is going to change the face
of the earth bringing justice, bread and an
answer.”
The Moral Re-Armament force in Latin
America is moving from Brazil and Peru to Chile,
Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries of that con
tinent.
IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE
IN EUROPE
At the same time a force of 400 from 36
nations is sweeping through countries of Europe
in an ideological offensive to answer defeatism,
Communism and division. Among them are fifty
Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World

and West. It is the next step forward for Com
munist and non-Communist alike.”
Gabriel Marcel, the French philosopher and
playwright, said at Lucerne, “Moral Re-Armament
is an immense effort to create a new living fabric
of humanity right across the world. In France to
day more and more men are responding to this
road.”
Vaterland, Swiss Catholic newspaper, wrote
of The Dragon, “Thus far the Chinese have been
the main agents of world Communism on many
fronts in Africa and South America. Now for the
first time in the history of the ideological struggle
representatives of Free China have appeared on
the scene, blazing a trail with their message. We
wei’e literally shaken as the play unfolded before
our eyes —a play that ends with a brilliant finale
as men realize that the power of the ideology of
Moral Re-Armament can usher in a new and bet
ter age. We made our way home with a great hope
in our hearts.”
The Moral Re-Armament force and the Chin
ese are being greeted by crowds of thousands night
after night who say that in their message they see
hope for peace in the world and the unity of
Europe. Civic leaders of Berlin ax’e among those
who have invited this force to their city. They be
lieve that the x’oot problem is not a wall that divides
a city or a continent but the steely selfishness that
separates man from man and all men from the gov
ernment of God.
Many African countries have invited the
forces of Mox-al Re-Ax’mament to come immedi
ately to their continent. President Kasavubu sent
his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
Africa. If the Congo goes Communist, all Africa
will follow. It is not enough to give dollars to un
derdeveloped countries. We must win the hearts
of the people. What we need is an ideology. That
ideology is Moral Re-Armament.” He told mox’e
than a thousand delegates from evex’y part of the
world that in the last twelve montlxs 483 I’adio
broadcasts about Moi'al Re-Armament have gone
out in five Congolese languages to all parts of his
country on the National Radio.
MORAL RE ARMAMENT OR
FINAL ANNIHILATION
U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, brought a
delegation of his countrymen to Caux last month.
On leaving he said, “Moral Re-Armament must go
on for ever if we want to prevent mankind from
plunging into final annihilation. If we want to stop
Communism taking hold of the world, we must deal
with corruption, bribery, drink, and womanizing.
If we want to change corrupt people we must be
honest ourselves. That is what impresses me very
much at Caux. With this ideology you are bound to
succeed.”
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahat
ma, said at Caux, “The issue for the world is not
Communism or war, but whether statesmen will
undertake the Moi’al Re-Armament of the Com
munist and non-Communist worlds. We must go
to Washington and Moscow with an ideology that
changes men. That is the next step for the Com
munist and non-Communist alike. Unless we
change human nature we can never fulfil the as
pirations of the millions in our countries.”
An Asian center for Moral Re-Armament will
open next spring near Tokyo to match the centers
of Caux and Mackinac. An Assembly for the Amer
icas is being held in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Over Christmas and New Year thei’e will be a Pan-
African Assembly for Moral Re-Armament at the
heart of Africa.
Mr. Khrushchev wants to see a diffex’ent kind
of world. Every honest person knows he is right
in the conviction that change is needed, however
much we disagi’ee with his way of doing it. The
leaders of the free world have in Moral Re-Arma
ment an ideology superior to Communism to offer
him. Even the most difficult will respond to the
firm, united but humble voice of democratic
nations morally rearmed. Why should there be
catastrophe again when with God renaissance is
inevitable ?
It is not a matter of left or right: it is a matter
of right or wrong.
Communism gave its philosophy to the world
last Christmas over the Moscow Radio when it
said: “Our x’ocket has by-passed the moon. It is
nearing the sun and we have not discovered God.
We have turned lights out in heaven that no man
will be able to put on again. We are breaking the
yoke of the Gospel, the opium of the masses. Let
us go forth and Chx’ist shall be relegated to myth
ology.”
Frank Buchman, in his last words, gave a
challenge to the modern world on the sixth of
August in Fi’eudenstadt when he said, “I want the
world to be governed by men governed by God.
Why not let God run the whole world ?”
It is the hour for heroic decision and embold
ened leadex’ship.
Choose ye lids day whom ye will serve.

MORAL RE-ARMAMENT
A TIDAL WAVE OF HOPE
MR. KHRUSHCHEV is 67. He plans to see
the Red Flag flying over every country in
the world during his lifetime. He thinks he can do
it. Every decision and action he takes over Berlin,
Laos, the Congo or at the United Nations is meas
ured against this one aim.
He has an ideology.
Nations outside the Communist bloc lack any
common ideology or world aim. They are divided
amongst themselves. They think that if they stand
up to Mr. Khrushchev they may be forced into
atomic war.
Appeasement is no answer to dictatorship.
The idealism of the United Nations without an
ideology often becomes the tool for Moscow’s aim.
Making big speeches to satisfy public opinion at
home and backing them by weak action when we
meet the Communists at the conference table
destroys the faith of the millions in the power of
the democratic way of life. Squatting in the streets,
however sincere, is no answer to the threat of the
H-bomb.
The answer is to stand up and fight in every
nation, everywhere, for an ideology that changes
Communist and non-Communist alike and unites
every race, class and color in the supreme task of
the century—the remaking of the world.
Men with an ideology superior to Communism
can not only stand up to Mr. Khrushchev but enlist
him in a greater revolution.
General Carpentier of France who was in
command of the land forces of NATO for Central
Europe and who had the training of the Brazilian
Army and commanded the French forces in Indo
china and elsewhere, put the issue clearly at the
World Assembly at Caux this year when he said,
“We need a tidal wave of Moral Re-Armament to
sweep across the world. Then men in Government
will be forced to make the right decisions that
spring not only from the intellect, but from our
hearts and faith.”
THE TIDE OF COMMUNISM
CAN BE TURNED
This tidal wave is flooding across the conti
nents. Marshal Tavora, national hero of Brazil,
flew last week to Rome. There he told leaders of
the Church and State, “With Moral Re-Armament
the tide of Communism in my country and Latin
America can be turned.”
His colleague General Bethlem, former Brazil
ian Ambassador in Bolivia and Pakistan, on that
same day was meeting in Los Angeles with Mr.
Kishi, Prime Minister of Japan until last year.
Both General Bethlem and Mr. Kishi had been at
Caux two weeks before. The General said, “In
Brazil and Peru 900,000 of my countrymen have
seen the Japanese play The Tiger. In the last five
months millions more have seen it on television. Its
message has already saved Brazil from civil war.”
He was referring to a play by the revolution
ary students of the Zengakuren of Japan. These
students led the riots in Tokyo last year w'hich
caused President Eisenhower’s visit to Japan to
be canceled. The students changed. They wrote a
play describing how Communism had captured
them through their own moral compromise and
how Moral Re-Armament had taught them to go
not right, not left, but straight. Then they went
to America and apologized to Eisenhower. He
urged them to go to Latin America.

In Manaus, a Communist stronghold of Brazil,
a thousand miles up the Amazon River, 90,000 peo
ple in one night alone saw a presentation of The
Tiger in the football stadium. On the same night
the Communist counter-rally across the road for
the anniversary of Castro’s Cuban revolution drew
a total of 40 people. One of the students said, “It
is the greatest event that has ever taken place in
Manaus. It has revolutionized our thinking.”
THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE
CRISIS IN BERLIN
Mr. Kishi, speaking with General Bethlem in
Los Angeles, told of how he had discussed with Gen
eral Eisenhower last week at Gettysburg the im
pact of the work of Moral Re-Armament through
out the South American continent. He said, “I
apologized to General Eisenhower for last year’s
riots and invited him to come as soon as possible
to Japan. 1 had two objectives in making my pres
ent journey around the world. The first was to
attend the Moi’al Re-Armament Assembly at Caux.
This Assembly made an impression on me that is
both deep and unforgettable. Secondly, I wanted
to meet again the world statesmen I had known
as Prime Minister. The only answer to the crisis in
Berlin and the challenge of Communism today is
the ideology of Moral Re-Armament. Nations to
day must form a solid front, a unity of purpose
and of spirit so evident to the Communist world
that they will not indulge in miscalculation nor
misunderstand our aim and goal. MRA is producing
this unity which transcends all national boundaries
and all minor divisions.”
In September Mr. Saburo Chiba, for three
years Chairman of the National Security Commit
tee of the Japanese Diet, flew straight from Caux
to confer with President Prado of Peru. He said
that his own experience as head of Security had
led him to two conclusions on how to answer Com
munism: (1) To impact the masses with a more
effective ideology and (2) To unite the countries of
the free world in a common strategy.
He told the President that no exclusively na
tional plan is adequate today. While the 13 Com
munist bloc countries are united in one global
strategy, 82 nations have not yet reached a com
mon mind and goal “in order to create a united
force in the free world.” He continued, “We must
create a united force of parliamentarians from
every nation. This is already being done in many
of the free countries.”

Former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi of Japan
TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IN PERU
President Prado invited Moral Re-Armament
to his country “to save democracy in Peru.” At
the National Stadium in Lima 60,000 people stood
in silence for a minute to honor the memory of
Frank Buchman, initiator of Moral Re-Armament,
before seeing a performance of The Tiger. Ten
thousand who could not get in listened over the
loudspeakers outside.
A force of these Japanese students went to San
Marcos University. This is the University which
organized the stoning of Vice President Nixon when
he visited Peru. Speaking on the Peruvian National
Radio after meeting the Japanese, one of these
student leaders said, “Five days ago we had riots.
Moral Re-Armament has made us understand that
the divisions which exist between political groups
arise because each group is out for itself. MRA
has come at the right moment to Peru.”
Another student leader said on the National
Radio: “In this atomic age man must give the
answer to exploitation by either Communism or
capitalism. Here is an ideology which rebuilds the
chaotic world today, which gives food to the
hungry, work to the unemployed and nils the empty
spirit of man which has been lost in immorality
and corruption.”
This week in Peru 40,000 people, including
thousands of Indians in colorful dress, thronged
to the great Sacsayhuaman fortress, stronghold of
the ancient Inca civilization, now known as the Mos
cow of Peru, to see The Tiger and hear it in the
original Inca language. The head of Indian affairs
said, “Your philosophy is going to change the face
of the earth bringing justice, bread and an
answer.”
The Moral Re-Armament force in Latin
America is moving from Brazil and Peru to Chile,
Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries of that con
tinent.
IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE
IN EUROPE
At the same time a force of 400 from 36
nations is sweeping through countries of Europe
in an ideological offensive to answer defeatism,
Communism and division. Among them are fifty
Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World
War II. General Ho Y r ing-chin said, “We lost the
mainland of China because we lacked an ideology.
The materialism in our own life was exploited by
Prime Minister U Nu of Burma
the Communists to take over China. We sacrificed
our country for our selfishness. I have been more
than thirty years a soldier, and I say that the way
to secure peace and freedom for the world is Moral
Re-Armament.”
These fifty Chinese have put their burning
convictions into a play called The Dragon, which
shows the tragedy of a nation lost through the
selfishness of men and gives the hope of an answer.
One of the leading industrialists of Europe,
after seeing The Dragon, said, “Nobody who sees
this play can be the same again. What I like most
about Moral Re-Armament is that it challenges the
rich, as it does everybody, to change their whole
motive of life.”
The former Comintern delegate, Hans Bjerk
holt, co-founder of the Norwegian Communist
Party, spoke last week to 22,000 people at a mass
demonstration with the Chinese play, The Dragon,
in the football stadium at Lucerne. “We are at the
most serious point in the history of mankind,” he
said, “when the leaders of the West start to waver
before Khrushchev. Our task is to move the masses
and give them courage to stand firm. MRA is the
superior ideology that has the power to unite East
and West. It is the next step forward for Com

his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
Africa. If the Congo goes Communist, all Africa
will follow. It is not enough to give dollars to un
derdeveloped countries. We must win the hearts
of the people. What we need is an ideology. That
ideology is Moral Re-Armament.” He told mox’e
than a thousand delegates from evex’y part of the
world that in the last twelve montlxs 483 I’adio
broadcasts about Moi'al Re-Armament have gone
out in five Congolese languages to all parts of his
country on the National Radio.
MORAL RE ARMAMENT OR
FINAL ANNIHILATION
U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, brought a
delegation of his countrymen to Caux last month.
On leaving he said, “Moral Re-Armament must go
on for ever if we want to prevent mankind from
plunging into final annihilation. If we want to stop
Communism taking hold of the world, we must deal
with corruption, bribery, drink, and womanizing.
If we want to change corrupt people we must be
honest ourselves. That is what impresses me very
much at Caux. With this ideology you are bound to
succeed.”
Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of the Mahat
ma, said at Caux, “The issue for the world is not
Communism or war, but whether statesmen will
undertake the Moi’al Re-Armament of the Com
munist and non-Communist worlds. We must go
to Washington and Moscow with an ideology that
changes men. That is the next step for the Com
munist and non-Communist alike. Unless we
change human nature we can never fulfil the as
pirations of the millions in our countries.”
An Asian center for Moral Re-Armament will
open next spring near Tokyo to match the centers
of Caux and Mackinac. An Assembly for the Amer
icas is being held in Rio de Janeiro next month.
Over Christmas and New Year thei’e will be a Pan-
African Assembly for Moral Re-Armament at the
heart of Africa.
Mr. Khrushchev wants to see a diffex’ent kind
of world. Every honest person knows he is right
in the conviction that change is needed, however
much we disagi’ee with his way of doing it. The
leaders of the free world have in Moral Re-Arma
ment an ideology superior to Communism to offer
him. Even the most difficult will respond to the
firm, united but humble voice of democratic
nations morally rearmed. Why should there be
catastrophe again when with God renaissance is
inevitable ?
It is not a matter of left or right: it is a matter
of right or wrong.
Communism gave its philosophy to the world
last Christmas over the Moscow Radio when it
said: “Our x’ocket has by-passed the moon. It is
nearing the sun and we have not discovered God.
We have turned lights out in heaven that no man
will be able to put on again. We are breaking the
yoke of the Gospel, the opium of the masses. Let
us go forth and Chx’ist shall be relegated to myth
ology.”
Frank Buchman, in his last words, gave a
challenge to the modern world on the sixth of
August in Fi’eudenstadt when he said, “I want the
world to be governed by men governed by God.
Why not let God run the whole world ?”
It is the hour for heroic decision and embold
ened leadex’ship.
Choose ye lids day whom ye will serve.

MORAL RE-ARMAMENT
A TIDAL WAVE OF HOPE
MR. KHRUSHCHEV is 67. He plans to see
the Red Flag flying over every country in
the world during his lifetime. He thinks he can do
it. Every decision and action he takes over Berlin,
Laos, the Congo or at the United Nations is meas
ured against this one aim.
He has an ideology.
Nations outside the Communist bloc lack any
common ideology or world aim. They are divided
amongst themselves. They think that if they stand
up to Mr. Khrushchev they may be forced into
atomic war.
Appeasement is no answer to dictatorship.
The idealism of the United Nations without an
ideology often becomes the tool for Moscow’s aim.
Making big speeches to satisfy public opinion at
home and backing them by weak action when we
meet the Communists at the conference table
destroys the faith of the millions in the power of
the democratic way of life. Squatting in the streets,
however sincere, is no answer to the threat of the
H-bomb.
The answer is to stand up and fight in every
nation, everywhere, for an ideology that changes
Communist and non-Communist alike and unites
every race, class and color in the supreme task of
the century—the remaking of the world.
Men with an ideology superior to Communism
can not only stand up to Mr. Khrushchev but enlist
him in a greater revolution.
General Carpentier of France who was in
command of the land forces of NATO for Central
Europe and who had the training of the Brazilian
Army and commanded the French forces in Indo
china and elsewhere, put the issue clearly at the
World Assembly at Caux this year when he said,
“We need a tidal wave of Moral Re-Armament to
sweep across the world. Then men in Government
will be forced to make the right decisions that
spring not only from the intellect, but from our
hearts and faith.”
THE TIDE OF COMMUNISM
CAN BE TURNED
This tidal wave is flooding across the conti
nents. Marshal Tavora, national hero of Brazil,
flew last week to Rome. There he told leaders of
the Church and State, “With Moral Re-Armament
the tide of Communism in my country and Latin
America can be turned.”
His colleague General Bethlem, former Brazil
ian Ambassador in Bolivia and Pakistan, on that
same day was meeting in Los Angeles with Mr.
Kishi, Prime Minister of Japan until last year.
Both General Bethlem and Mr. Kishi had been at
Caux two weeks before. The General said, “In
Brazil and Peru 900,000 of my countrymen have
seen the Japanese play The Tiger. In the last five
months millions more have seen it on television. Its
message has already saved Brazil from civil war.”
He was referring to a play by the revolution
ary students of the Zengakuren of Japan. These
students led the riots in Tokyo last year w'hich
caused President Eisenhower’s visit to Japan to
be canceled. The students changed. They wrote a
play describing how Communism had captured
them through their own moral compromise and
how Moral Re-Armament had taught them to go
not right, not left, but straight. Then they went
to America and apologized to Eisenhower. He
urged them to go to Latin America.

Marshal Juarez Tavora, national hero of Brazil
In Manaus, a Communist stronghold of Brazil,
a thousand miles up the Amazon River, 90,000 peo
ple in one night alone saw a presentation of The
Tiger in the football stadium. On the same night
the Communist counter-rally across the road for
the anniversary of Castro’s Cuban revolution drew
a total of 40 people. One of the students said, “It
is the greatest event that has ever taken place in
Manaus. It has revolutionized our thinking.”
THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE
CRISIS IN BERLIN
Mr. Kishi, speaking with General Bethlem in
Los Angeles, told of how he had discussed with Gen
eral Eisenhower last week at Gettysburg the im
pact of the work of Moral Re-Armament through
out the South American continent. He said, “I
apologized to General Eisenhower for last year’s
riots and invited him to come as soon as possible
to Japan. 1 had two objectives in making my pres
ent journey around the world. The first was to
attend the Moi’al Re-Armament Assembly at Caux.
This Assembly made an impression on me that is
both deep and unforgettable. Secondly, I wanted
to meet again the world statesmen I had known
as Prime Minister. The only answer to the crisis in
Berlin and the challenge of Communism today is
the ideology of Moral Re-Armament. Nations to
day must form a solid front, a unity of purpose
and of spirit so evident to the Communist world
that they will not indulge in miscalculation nor
misunderstand our aim and goal. MRA is producing
this unity which transcends all national boundaries
and all minor divisions.”
In September Mr. Saburo Chiba, for three
years Chairman of the National Security Commit
tee of the Japanese Diet, flew straight from Caux
to confer with President Prado of Peru. He said
that his own experience as head of Security had
led him to two conclusions on how to answer Com
munism: (1) To impact the masses with a more
effective ideology and (2) To unite the countries of
the free world in a common strategy.
He told the President that no exclusively na
tional plan is adequate today. While the 13 Com
munist bloc countries are united in one global
strategy, 82 nations have not yet reached a com
mon mind and goal “in order to create a united
force in the free world.” He continued, “We must
create a united force of parliamentarians from
every nation. This is already being done in many
of the free countries.”

Former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi of Japan
TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IN PERU
President Prado invited Moral Re-Armament
to his country “to save democracy in Peru.” At
the National Stadium in Lima 60,000 people stood
in silence for a minute to honor the memory of
Frank Buchman, initiator of Moral Re-Armament,
before seeing a performance of The Tiger. Ten
thousand who could not get in listened over the
loudspeakers outside.
A force of these Japanese students went to San
Marcos University. This is the University which
organized the stoning of Vice President Nixon when
he visited Peru. Speaking on the Peruvian National
Radio after meeting the Japanese, one of these
student leaders said, “Five days ago we had riots.
Moral Re-Armament has made us understand that
the divisions which exist between political groups
arise because each group is out for itself. MRA
has come at the right moment to Peru.”
Another student leader said on the National
Radio: “In this atomic age man must give the
answer to exploitation by either Communism or
capitalism. Here is an ideology which rebuilds the
chaotic world today, which gives food to the
hungry, work to the unemployed and nils the empty
spirit of man which has been lost in immorality
and corruption.”
This week in Peru 40,000 people, including
thousands of Indians in colorful dress, thronged
to the great Sacsayhuaman fortress, stronghold of
the ancient Inca civilization, now known as the Mos
cow of Peru, to see The Tiger and hear it in the
original Inca language. The head of Indian affairs
said, “Your philosophy is going to change the face
of the earth bringing justice, bread and an
answer.”
The Moral Re-Armament force in Latin
America is moving from Brazil and Peru to Chile,
Bolivia, Uruguay, and other countries of that con
tinent.
IDEOLOGICAL OFFENSIVE
IN EUROPE
At the same time a force of 400 from 36
nations is sweeping through countries of Europe
in an ideological offensive to answer defeatism,
Communism and division. Among them are fifty
Chinese from Taiwan headed by General Ho Ying
chin, former Prime Minister of China and wartime
Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese armies, who
received the Japanese sword of surrender in World
War II. General Ho Y r ing-chin said, “We lost the
mainland of China because we lacked an ideology.
The materialism in our own life was exploited by
Prime Minister U Nu of Burma
the Communists to take over China. We sacrificed
our country for our selfishness. I have been more
than thirty years a soldier, and I say that the way
to secure peace and freedom for the world is Moral
Re-Armament.”
These fifty Chinese have put their burning
convictions into a play called The Dragon, which
shows the tragedy of a nation lost through the
selfishness of men and gives the hope of an answer.
One of the leading industrialists of Europe,
after seeing The Dragon, said, “Nobody who sees
this play can be the same again. What I like most
about Moral Re-Armament is that it challenges the
rich, as it does everybody, to change their whole
motive of life.”
The former Comintern delegate, Hans Bjerk
holt, co-founder of the Norwegian Communist
Party, spoke last week to 22,000 people at a mass
demonstration with the Chinese play, The Dragon,
in the football stadium at Lucerne. “We are at the
most serious point in the history of mankind,” he
said, “when the leaders of the West start to waver
before Khrushchev. Our task is to move the masses
and give them courage to stand firm. MRA is the
superior ideology that has the power to unite East
and West. It is the next step forward for Com
munist and non-Communist alike.”
Gabriel Marcel, the French philosopher and
playwright, said at Lucerne, “Moral Re-Armament
is an immense effort to create a new living fabric
of humanity right across the world. In France to
day more and more men are responding to this
road.”
Vaterland, Swiss Catholic newspaper, wrote
of The Dragon, “Thus far the Chinese have been
the main agents of world Communism on many
fronts in Africa and South America. Now for the
first time in the history of the ideological struggle
representatives of Free China have appeared on
the scene, blazing a trail with their message. We
wei’e literally shaken as the play unfolded before
our eyes —a play that ends with a brilliant finale
as men realize that the power of the ideology of
Moral Re-Armament can usher in a new and bet
ter age. We made our way home with a great hope
in our hearts.”
The Moral Re-Armament force and the Chin
ese are being greeted by crowds of thousands night
after night who say that in their message they see
hope for peace in the world and the unity of
Europe. Civic leaders of Berlin ax’e among those
who have invited this force to their city. They be
lieve that the x’oot problem is not a wall that divides
a city or a continent but the steely selfishness that
separates man from man and all men from the gov
ernment of God.
Many African countries have invited the
forces of Mox-al Re-Ax’mament to come immedi
ately to their continent. President Kasavubu sent
his wife and son as leadei’s of the Congolese dele
gation to Caux last month. Speaking on behalf of
the delegation, Adolphe Kasavubu, the son of the
President, said, “The Congo is at the center of
