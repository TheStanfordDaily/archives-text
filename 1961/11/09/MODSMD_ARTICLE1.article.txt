### KAY STANFIELD 
Stanford is currently hosting
Monsieur Jean Malaquois, a noted
author visiting from France. Mai
aquais is now teaching French
Romantic Literature at the Uni
versity; courses on Andre Gide,
Andre Malroy, and the French
theatre will be taught by him
next quarter.
An author, essayist and poet,
Malaquais wrote his doctorate
thesis on philosophy at the Sor
bonne. He has been “in and out”
of the United States since 1946.
He has taught at New York Uni
versity, at the University of Texas
and at the University of Minne
sota. The author has also lec
tured “all over the country.” Mal
aquais formerly held a Guggen
heim Fellowship.
In answer to a question con
cerning the quality of Stanford’s
Humanities Department, Mala
quais replied, “Stanford wishes
to be the Harvard of the West,
which is great. From my point
of view, all my sympathies go to
anything that aims high. A great
university is essentially charac
terized by the quality of its hu
manities department. Electronic
gadgets, telescopes and cyclotrons
are fine, but without a first-rate
humanities department, there is
no great university.”
THE STANFORD Humanities
Department, according to Mala
quais, is a “poor orphan in a
very rich institution.” He com
pared the resources of that de
partment to those of the various
science departments as “a drop
in a bucketful of water.”
Malaquais was asked the tra
ditional query about the differ
ence between American and
European students. He readily
stated that “there is quite a dif

ference, but it is very difficult
to point out where it lies. Even
their appearances and goals are
different. In Europe the students
are more mature, both intellec
tually and emotionally. On the
other hand, the American student
is more eager to learn, although
his eagerness is very often an
expression of his anxiety.
“American mores are such that
before a child is horn, his prospec
tive parents are planning for his
college education. A college edu
cation here is like a stepping
board to achieve some sort of
financial success. In other words,
American students attend college
for the sake of security, not for
the sake of knowledge.’’
MALAQUAIS also had several
comments to make on the stu
dent - teacher relationship, both
here and abroad. “In America the
student ■teacher relationship is
more humane, more relaxed.
Classes here are much smaller;
an average class at the Sorbonne
counts sometimes up to 250 stu
dents. Students and teacher sel
dom get acquainted. The relation
ship should be one of mutual re
spect, that of civilized human be
ings when they meet.”
Malaquais prefers the Ameri
can relationship to that at the
European universities. “1 want
them (students) to speak up and
speak out, to disagree. I don’t
want them to feed on pre-cooked,
pre-digested canned culture. I am
proposing to them a new way of
thinking, away of looking.” The
professor indicated that his rela
tionships with students have been
"pleasant and to some extent
fruitful."
It was wondered what induced
Malaquais to come to Stanford.
“I was invited,” he logically re
plied. "I wanted to see California
—palm trees, blue skies, and smil
ing girls. The weather is very
similar to that of southern
France. It gives one a physical
kick—quite exhilarating.”
Monsieur Malaquais has no
ticed that the people in the
streets, cars and shops are far
more polite and relaxed than in
the East. According to the
Frenchman, we are less under
pressure and more civilized than
Easterners.
HE SHOWED amazement that
“car drivers have some respect
for the pedestrians. If you need
to get onto the freeway from a
side-street, other cars will stop
and let you go.”
Jean Malaquais has a final
word for Stanfordites. “I like the
aspect of the campus. I like bikes
around -I’ve never seen so many
bikes in one place! It’s quiet here,
in spite of phony sports cars rac
ing around. I've discovered some
thing here that I thought had dis
appeared in America: you stu
dents have legs! Congratulations!
One never sees people using their
legs anymore—they’re always in
a bar or cars.”


VISITING French author Mala
quais sees Stanford students as
seeking more security than edu
cation.
