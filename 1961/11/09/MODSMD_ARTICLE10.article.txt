## NAACP Head On Tomorrow 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:15
Roy Wilkins, executive secretary
of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP', will speak in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The speech, sponsored by the
Political Union and the Model
United States Senate, will be open
to the public.
The NAACP was founded in 1909
by persons of both white and
Negro races to champion full eco
nomic, civil, legal and political
rights for the Negro. The organi
zation investigates lynchings and
violations of civil rights, encour
ages Negroes to exercise political
power, and assembles information
on Negro participation in, and
benefit from, expenditures of
public tax money.
It has initiated court cases
when it has discovered instances
of interference with civil rights,
it carries on public relations pro
gram and legislative activities,
and it helps individual Negroes
further their education and ob
tain employment.
Wilkins has frequently met
with opposition from Communist
sympathizers within the NAACP.
To urge support of President Tru
manâ€™s civil rights legislation, the
NAACP enlisted support from 58
civic, religious, and labor organ
izations, but refused support
from the reputedly left-wing Civil
Rights Congress.
