jsident Kennedy yesterday raised
litary budget next year by declar
aise spending to keep U.S. armed
The President also told a news
as pressing ahead with plans to
■resume nuclear tests in the air if
a study of recent Soviet tests
shows such action is necessary.
Rejecting any more voluntary
test moratoriums, Kennedy said:
“THE SOVIET Union tested
while we were at the table nego
tiating with them. If they fooled
us once, it is their fault. If they
fool us twice, it is our fault.”
In a third defense development,
the President defended his criti
cism during the 1960 election cam
paign of what the Democrats
then referred to as the ‘‘missile
gap” between this country and
Russia. In recent weeks he has
said this country is still well
ahead in military power.
Kennedy said he based his 1960
statements on publiu statements
by members of the Eisenhower
administration who were in a'po
sition to know. He said many
members of the Eisenhower ad
ministration were saying the
same thing at the time.
THE PRESIDENT then ticked
off steps he has taken this year
to strengthen the armed forces,
including a $6 billion increase in
defense funds. It was at this
point that he said “we are going
to ask for additional funds for
defense next year.”
The defense budget this year
now totals about $47 billion. Mili
tary officials indicated previously
that the budget would run to at
least $5O billion in the fiscal year
starting next July 1.
One report circulated in the
Pentagon last month was that the
new defense appropriations re
quest might total as high a« $53.7
billion. There also will be a $3OO
million supplemental request for
the current fiscal year to meet the
cost of calling up two National
Guard divisions that reported Oct.
1 in the face of the Berlin crisis.

EVEN SO, the President said
that all intelligence available to
him now indicates the United
States is second to none, or as he
put it: “We would not trade places
with anyone in the world.” He said
he intended to keep it that way.

The President willingly placed
Russia first in one category— ra
dioactive fallout from nuclear
tests. Rejecting Soviet claims that
the United States and Britain pro
duced more fallout, ho said there
was no doubt that Russia “is first
in that very dubious category.”

As for Americans protecting
themselves from fallout, Kennedy
said he hoped a forthcoming gov
ernment booklet would.supply ac
curate and precise information on
the role “each family, each com
munity, each state and the federal
government” would play.
