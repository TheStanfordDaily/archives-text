# Demonstrations for Peace Vital Need
## 
### 
A United Press International dispatch from New York yesterday
told how “An estimated 1,000 women picketed for peace outside the
United Nations headquarters . . It goes on to describe the scene,
with “The women, many of them pushing children in carriages or
carrying babes in arms” toting home-made signs or lapel slogans
proclaiming “Women for Peace.”
One woman there said there was no specific organization behind
the demonstration. “It’s grown spontaneously, by word of month,”
she said.
This item, which warranted only three inches of wire copy, is
one of the numerous signs of a stirring among some Americans re
cently which indicates they realize how close the world is to a war
which would destroy civilized society.
What gives us hope is that these various groups who have dem
onstrated show a willingness—despite warning rumbles from oil to
the Right—to criticize the U.S. government as well as Russia. In
other words, they realize the U.S. is not necessarily right, and see
the stupidity and inhumanity of Decatur’s oft-quoted saying, “My
country—right or wrong!”
The group of students which started out as four and wound up
with about 25 people willing to sit on the library lawn and seriously
discuss the pros and cons of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons,
is another example of this. And the fact that at Stanford 585 persons
would sign a petition calling on both this nation and Russia to cease
atmospheric testing is enough to prod a little optimism in our heart.
Another indication of an awareness among average persons of
the problems facing the world and the necessity to find solutions
now came last Saturday when a group of elementary, high school
and college students staged a “Peace Walk” in Palo Alto. And while
it is obvious that such demonstrations as we have mentioned will
not, by themselves, change the course of world events, it should be
just as obvious that individuals must make their views known and
often today the most effective way is to sign petitions, or to physi
cally demonstrate.
One thing is for certain: if enough persons make public their
concern over the trend of world affairs, governments must listen.
The world, and particularly the U.S. and Russia, needs more dem
onstrations by the average citizen.

This item, which warranted only three inches of wire copy, is
one of the numerous signs of a stirring among some Americans re
cently which indicates they realize how close the world is to a war
which would destroy civilized society.
What gives us hope is that these various groups who have dem
onstrated show a willingness—despite warning rumbles from oil to
the Right—to criticize the U.S. government as well as Russia. In
other words, they realize the U.S. is not necessarily right, and see
the stupidity and inhumanity of Decatur’s oft-quoted saying, “My
country—right or wrong!”
The group of students which started out as four and wound up
with about 25 people willing to sit on the library lawn and seriously
discuss the pros and cons of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons,
is another example of this. And the fact that at Stanford 585 persons
would sign a petition calling on both this nation and Russia to cease
atmospheric testing is enough to prod a little optimism in our heart.
Another indication of an awareness among average persons of
the problems facing the world and the necessity to find solutions
now came last Saturday when a group of elementary, high school
and college students staged a “Peace Walk” in Palo Alto. And while
it is obvious that such demonstrations as we have mentioned will
not, by themselves, change the course of world events, it should be
just as obvious that individuals must make their views known and
often today the most effective way is to sign petitions, or to physi
cally demonstrate.
One thing is for certain: if enough persons make public their
concern over the trend of world affairs, governments must listen.
The world, and particularly the U.S. and Russia, needs more dem
onstrations by the average citizen.
