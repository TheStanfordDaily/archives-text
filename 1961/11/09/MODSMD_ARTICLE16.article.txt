# ELECTION AFTERMATH
## Democrats Happy over Jersey, N.Y. Victories 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Presi
clent Kennedy led Democratic
leaders yesterday in pointing to
their upset New Jersey election
victory and their New York City
triumph as endorsements of the
administration’s program.
Refusing to hide his glee, the
President remarked during a walk
through the White House lobby
that he had “a good trip” into New
Jersey. He referred to his cam
paign appearance on behalf of
Democrat Richard Hughes, sur
prise winner of the New Jersey
governorship.
Democratic Chairman John M.
Bailey and some other party offi
cials also said Tuesday’s off-year
election results showed the Demo
crats would retain control of Con
gress next year. The GOP high
command countered that no such
omen could be read into the re
turns.
REPUBLICAN National Chair
man William E. Miller conceded
“disappointment” over James P.
Mitchell’s defeat in his bid for the
New Jersey state house. But he
said the setback was “by no means
a major blow to the Republican
party’s hopes in 1962.”
Miller said the GOP scored “sig
nificant gains” in state and local
offices in five states—Ohio, Penn
sylvania, New York, Kentucky and
Arizona. He particularly cited the
victory of Henry X. O’Brien for a
seat on the Pennsylvania supreme
court.
On the other hand, Democrats
pointed repeatedly to their tri
umphs in New Jersey and in New
York City where Mayor Robert F.
Wagner won re-election by some
400,000 votes over Republican
Louis J. Lefkowitz. Kennedy sent
congratulations to party winners.
WHITE HOUSE Press Secre
tary Pierre Salinger said early in
the day that the President, who
received election returns during
the night, was greatly pleased.
Salinger also said the President’s
program had “a major effect” on

the outcome.
The Democrats were especially
happy with the triumph of Hughes
in Now Jersey. A political un
known, he ran up a 40,000 vote
margin in taking the state house
from Mitchell, labor secretary in
former President Dwight D. Ei
senhower’s cabinet.
Eisenhower, who appeared in
both New Jersey and New York
City for the GOP candidates, had
no comment on the outcome. At
Gettysburg. Pa„ an. aide said “the
general said he had no statement
to make.”
ALBERT B. HERMANN, direc
tor of political organizations and
campaigns for the Republican Na
tional Committee, called the New
Jersey result a “shockeroo” for his
party. He started a series of
checks to determine what happen
ed.
Among Democrats looking hope
fully to the 1962 congressional
campaign was Senate Party Whip
Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn. Ho
said both Wagner and Hughes
were strong Kennedy supporters
and their victories showed the ad
ministration was strong through
out the country.
In Independence, Mo., former
President Harry S. Truman also
interpreted the results as an en
dorsement of the party’s program.
But he preferred to wait until all
returns were in before predicting
how strong the Democrats would
be in 1962.
IN TUESDAY’S only congress
ional race. Democrat Lucien N.
Nedzi overwhelmingly defeated
Republican Walter Czarnecki in
Michigan’s predominantly Demo
cratic First District, which in
cludes Detroit. Nedzi will fill the
House seat vacated by Democratic
Rep, Thaddeus Machrowicz, who
became a federal judge.
In Virginia, Democrat Alber
tis S. Harrison won the governor
ship over Republican H. Clyde
Pearson with the Democrats poll
ing their usual 65 per cent of the
vote.

their upset New Jersey election
victory and their New York City
triumph as endorsements of the

offices in five states—Ohio, Penn
sylvania, New York, Kentucky and
Arizona. He particularly cited the
victory of Henry X. O’Brien for a
seat on the Pennsylvania supreme
court.
On the other hand, Democrats

Wagner won re-election by some
