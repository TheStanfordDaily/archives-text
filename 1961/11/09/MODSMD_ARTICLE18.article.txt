LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Editor, The Daily:
Re: Checking letters to the edi
tor:
The students of Stanford have
stated acceptance of the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code
while attending Stanford. There
fore, we should not only abide by
thse rules, but trust those who
have stated they will abide by
them. Mistrust on the part of one
breeds mistrust on the part of
more.

There have been some who have
abused these rules in the past, and
there will probably be a few who
will abuse them in the future.
However, nothing that regulates
human conduct will be 100 per cent
successful.
Those who have broken the Fun
damental Standard most recently
are those freshmen involved in the
full moon and forged letter inci
dents.
The fact that these incidents
happen is not proof that the Fun
damental Standard and Honor
Code are not taken seriously. They
are mistakes that must be account
ed for. They were. The fact that
the guilty parties voluntarily
turned themselves in shows that
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code do work at Stanford.
In my opinion, the small number
of forged letters lhat might occur
in the future (1 in the last year) is
not as great a wrong as The Daily

(owned and published by the As
sociated Students of Stanford Uni
versity) not upholding its part of
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code.
I ask that you abolish the rule of
having to personally turn in let
ters to the editor in order that you
may check the person's identifica
tion.
O. David Niedermeyer Jr.
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Much as The
Daily would like to accept all let
ters without question ami without
checking identification, it cannot
do so. While only two (not one)

forgeries have gotten in the paper
in the last year, we have detected
a number of attempts at getting
forged letters printed.
Our main reason for checking
identification is that forged let
ters invariably are signed with a
real student’s name, and bring em
barrassment or harm to that inno
cent student. By checking identi
fication we prevent this. So, for
this and other reasons, the current
policy of checking identification
will continue until the end of this
volume.)

breeds mistrust on the part of
more.

There have been some who have
abused these rules in the past, and
there will probably be a few who
will abuse them in the future.
However, nothing that regulates
human conduct will be 100 per cent
successful.
Those who have broken the Fun
damental Standard most recently
are those freshmen involved in the
full moon and forged letter inci
dents.
The fact that these incidents
happen is not proof that the Fun
damental Standard and Honor
Code are not taken seriously. They
are mistakes that must be account
ed for. They were. The fact that
the guilty parties voluntarily
turned themselves in shows that
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code do work at Stanford.
In my opinion, the small number
of forged letters lhat might occur
in the future (1 in the last year) is
not as great a wrong as The Daily

(owned and published by the As
sociated Students of Stanford Uni
versity) not upholding its part of
the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code.
I ask that you abolish the rule of
having to personally turn in let
ters to the editor in order that you
may check the person's identifica
tion.

(EDITOR’S NOTE: Much as The
Daily would like to accept all let
ters without question ami without
checking identification, it cannot
do so. While only two (not one)

forgeries have gotten in the paper
in the last year, we have detected
a number of attempts at getting
forged letters printed.
Our main reason for checking
identification is that forged let
ters invariably are signed with a
real student’s name, and bring em
barrassment or harm to that inno
cent student. By checking identi
fication we prevent this. So, for
this and other reasons, the current
policy of checking identification
will continue until the end of this
volume.)
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Editor, The Daily:
Re: Checking letters to the edi
tor:
The students of Stanford have
stated acceptance of the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code
while attending Stanford. There
fore, we should not only abide by
thse rules, but trust those who
have stated they will abide by
them. Mistrust on the part of one
breeds mistrust on the part of
more.

abused these rules in the past, and

will abuse them in the future.
