agreed that the freedom of West
Berlin and Western access to the

THIS WAS reported after the
two leaders spent an hour and 40
minutes entirely alone in their
third meeting in as many days.
Kennedy wound up the session
by escorting Nehru around the
south lawn of the White House,
conversing rapidly at the same
time he was pointing out such
sights as Caroline Kennedy’s play
school.
The President told reporters the
talks were “very good.”

the prime minister apparently
have some differences on how
those should be maintained.
