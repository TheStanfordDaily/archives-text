HONOR CODE
Editor, The Daily:
I wholeheartedly agree with Mr.
Mitcham on the need for a re-eval
uation of the Honor Code.
In a booklet prepared by the
Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code Commission, the success of
the Code is said to be in direct pro

portion to the students’ and facul
ty’s mutual respect, and their con
fidence and faith in the Code.

Perhaps an indication of this
success is a statement a professor
recently made in class: “I love
you all, but I don’t trust any of
you.” Such feelings cannot exist
if the Honor Code is to be at all
meaningful to students.
“Interpretations” of the Honor
Code, such as alternate seating, no
removal of exams from an exam
room, the necessity of a signed
certificate of illness for absence
from a final, and the importance
of reporting and punishing viola
tions, all convey the feeling that
wo are trusted only as long as it is
difficult and unprofitable to cheat.
Does this help the student develop
a sense of honor and self-respect?
Can ho ever learn to trust his fel
low students in such an atmos
phere?
Many realists would argue that
Stanford students are not all ma
ture or responsible enough to be
trusted. Whether or not this is
true, it is only when the student
is trusted and respected that he
develops personal honor, responsi
bility and self-respect.
Under the system now in exist
ence, he has little chance to devel
op such characteristics. A pure,
ideal Honor Code, however, with
no strings attached, would provide
an atmosphere in which students
could become mature adults, wor
thy of respect and of the confi
dence placed in them.
The restrictions and interpreta
tions attached to the Honor Code
must be removed if it is ever to be
come truly meaningful to both
students and faculty.
