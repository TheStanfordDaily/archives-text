### 
TOULON, France (UPD—Pres
ident Charles de Gaulle returned
to mainland France yesterday aft
er a whirlwind tour of Corsica and
told welcoming crowds he hopes
for early negotiations on Algeria’s
independence.
The French president received
a hearty reception as he made a
grass roots tour through south
eastern France following a 36-
hour Corsican visit.
A single incident marred De
Gaulle’s Corsican visit earlier yes
terday when security forces dis
covered and unexploded plastic
bomb in a doorway some 300 yards
from the spot in Ajaccio where the
president was to make a speech.
The bomb heightened fears of
an assassination attempt against
De Gaulle by the right-wing secret
army organization (OAS), whose
members are opposed to a Moslem
ruled Algerian state.
De Gaulle addressed crowds in
the Corsican capital of Ajaccio,
then flew to the mainland where
he spoke at Hyeres, Frejus and
Toulon, site of a big French naval
base.
