# Recipe (or Statesmen: Education in History

### LOUIS CASSELS 
WASHINGTON (UPD—During;
the latter part of the 18th century. |
the United States produced a gal
axy of statesmen which has been
unmatched since that day in this I
or any other country.
How do you account for the fact'
that an infant republic, with no
major cities, no great universities
and fewer than one million adult I
citizens, was able to bring forth in j
a single generation such leaders [
as Washington, Jefferson, Frank-1
lin, Hamilton, Madison, John Ad- j
ams and John Jay?
A NOTED AMERICAN histori
an, Prof. Henry Steele Commager ;
of Amherst College, explores these j
questions in the current issue of ;
“Daedalus,” the quarterly journal
of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
His conclusion is that three con
ditions helped to stimulate the
“remarkable outpouring of politi
cal leadership” which the United
Stales witnessed between 1775 and
1800. One of them exists today.
The others, he suggests, are not
present in modern American soci
ety, but steps may be taken to cul
tivate them.
The condition which modern
America has in common with the
18th century can be summed up in
a single word: challenge.
“There is nothing like challenge
for bringing out character, noth
ing like emergency for bringing
out ingenuity,” says Commager.
The generation of Washington,
Jefferson and Adams was con
fronted with the challenge of win
ning independence, writing a con
stitution, establishing a central
government—in short, founding a
nation.
THE PROBLEMS OF states
manship in 1961 are different, but
they are certainly no less formid
able. If challenge alone were
enough to call forth greatness,
thi§ should be a golden age of poli
tical leadership.
A second explanation for the
18th century’s fertility in produc
ing statesmen, Commager be
lieves, can be found in the narrow
ness of opportunity which prevail
ed in the raw new republic. There
was no chance for a man of genius
to win renown, as he might have
done in Europe, through a mili
tary career or by rising to emi
nence in an established church or
an ancient university. The talent
ed 18th century American really
had only one arena—public life—
in which to show his mettle. He
went into politics because that was
the only kind of leadership ca
reer open to him.
Today the situation is just the
opposite “Openings, - indeed .invi
tations- are innumerable, and tal
ent finds more glittering rewards
in private than in public enter
prise.”
COMMAGER says modern
America can and must take steps
to “restore the balance” and make
public service once more attrac
tive to men of great ability.
This will require the creation of
a better equilibrium between the
salaries paid to those who carry
heavy public responsibilities and
those who work in similar jobs in
private business. It also' calls for
giving public servants greater pro
tection against unwarranted abuse
from political demagogues, con
gressional investigators, and
“journalists who yield nothing to
these investigators in 1 heir con
tempt for privacy and for do
conev.”

18th century flowering of political
leadership was education a type
of education which placed heavy
emphasis on history and the clas
sics, and which instilled in young
men “an avid sense of duty and of
civic virtue.”
“It is customary now,” Com
mager writes, “to disparage 18th
century education, to equate the
colleges of that day with the bet
ter high schools of our day, and to
recall how few Americans were
exposed to the advantages of for
mal education.
“YET THE products of the 18th
century educational machinery
seemed to think more deeply (cer
tainly in the political realm) and
to write more clearly (in any
realm) than the products of the
far more elaborate educational
systems of our own time.”
The generation of Washington
and Jefferson through its study
of Greek and Roman literature
and the literature of English liber
ty “learned that the same rules of
morality operated at all times, in
ail places and in all-societies; that
the affairs of men were controlled
by undeviating ‘laws of Nature
and Nature's God’; and that there
was, in the words of Washington,
“an indissoluble union between
duty and advantage.”
It is “an understatement,” Com
mager adds drily, to say that mod
ern education rarely instills in
young people the feeling for his
tory and the sense of “obligation
to posterity” which was so con
spicuous in our 18th century fore
bears.
“AT A TIME when the history
of Greece and Rome and even of
England have all but disappeared
from the school curricula,” he
says, “it is relevant to recall that
the men who fought the Revolu
tion and wrote the Constitution
and Bill of Rights were brought up
on the histories of Greece and
Rome and England.
“At a time when narrative his
tory has given way to ‘problems’
and when the celebration of heroes
is regarded as a vestigial remnant
of Victorianism, it is relevant to
observe that, if we deny young
people the wonder and excitement
of historical narration and of he
roes, we cannot expect them to re
spond passionately to the moral
crises of our own time.”

WASHINGTON (UPD—During;
the latter part of the 18th century. |
the United States produced a gal
axy of statesmen which has been
unmatched since that day in this I
or any other country.
How do you account for the fact'
that an infant republic, with no
major cities, no great universities
and fewer than one million adult I
citizens, was able to bring forth in j
a single generation such leaders [
as Washington, Jefferson, Frank-1
lin, Hamilton, Madison, John Ad- j
ams and John Jay?
A NOTED AMERICAN histori
an, Prof. Henry Steele Commager ;
of Amherst College, explores these j
questions in the current issue of ;
“Daedalus,” the quarterly journal
of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
His conclusion is that three con
ditions helped to stimulate the
“remarkable outpouring of politi
cal leadership” which the United
Stales witnessed between 1775 and
1800. One of them exists today.
The others, he suggests, are not
present in modern American soci
ety, but steps may be taken to cul
tivate them.
The condition which modern
America has in common with the
18th century can be summed up in
a single word: challenge.
“There is nothing like challenge
for bringing out character, noth
ing like emergency for bringing
out ingenuity,” says Commager.
The generation of Washington,
Jefferson and Adams was con
fronted with the challenge of win
ning independence, writing a con
stitution, establishing a central
government—in short, founding a
nation.
THE PROBLEMS OF states
manship in 1961 are different, but
they are certainly no less formid
able. If challenge alone were
enough to call forth greatness,
thi§ should be a golden age of poli
tical leadership.
A second explanation for the
18th century’s fertility in produc
ing statesmen, Commager be
lieves, can be found in the narrow
ness of opportunity which prevail
ed in the raw new republic. There
was no chance for a man of genius
to win renown, as he might have
done in Europe, through a mili
tary career or by rising to emi
nence in an established church or
an ancient university. The talent
ed 18th century American really
had only one arena—public life—
in which to show his mettle. He
went into politics because that was
the only kind of leadership ca
reer open to him.
Today the situation is just the
opposite “Openings, - indeed .invi
tations- are innumerable, and tal
ent finds more glittering rewards
in private than in public enter
prise.”
COMMAGER says modern
America can and must take steps
to “restore the balance” and make
public service once more attrac
tive to men of great ability.
This will require the creation of
a better equilibrium between the
salaries paid to those who carry
heavy public responsibilities and
those who work in similar jobs in
private business. It also' calls for
giving public servants greater pro
tection against unwarranted abuse
from political demagogues, con
gressional investigators, and
“journalists who yield nothing to
these investigators in 1 heir con
tempt for privacy and for do
conev.”

18th century flowering of political
leadership was education a type
of education which placed heavy
emphasis on history and the clas
sics, and which instilled in young
men “an avid sense of duty and of
civic virtue.”
“It is customary now,” Com
mager writes, “to disparage 18th
century education, to equate the
colleges of that day with the bet
ter high schools of our day, and to
recall how few Americans were
exposed to the advantages of for
mal education.
“YET THE products of the 18th
century educational machinery
seemed to think more deeply (cer
tainly in the political realm) and
to write more clearly (in any
realm) than the products of the
far more elaborate educational
systems of our own time.”
The generation of Washington
and Jefferson through its study
of Greek and Roman literature
and the literature of English liber
ty “learned that the same rules of
morality operated at all times, in
ail places and in all-societies; that
the affairs of men were controlled
by undeviating ‘laws of Nature
and Nature's God’; and that there
was, in the words of Washington,
“an indissoluble union between
duty and advantage.”

WASHINGTON (UPD—During;
the latter part of the 18th century. |
the United States produced a gal
axy of statesmen which has been
unmatched since that day in this I
or any other country.
How do you account for the fact'
that an infant republic, with no
major cities, no great universities
and fewer than one million adult I
citizens, was able to bring forth in j
a single generation such leaders [
as Washington, Jefferson, Frank-1
lin, Hamilton, Madison, John Ad- j
ams and John Jay?
A NOTED AMERICAN histori
an, Prof. Henry Steele Commager ;
of Amherst College, explores these j
questions in the current issue of ;
“Daedalus,” the quarterly journal
of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
His conclusion is that three con
ditions helped to stimulate the
“remarkable outpouring of politi
cal leadership” which the United
Stales witnessed between 1775 and
1800. One of them exists today.
The others, he suggests, are not
present in modern American soci
ety, but steps may be taken to cul
tivate them.
The condition which modern
America has in common with the
18th century can be summed up in
a single word: challenge.
“There is nothing like challenge
for bringing out character, noth
ing like emergency for bringing
out ingenuity,” says Commager.
The generation of Washington,
Jefferson and Adams was con
fronted with the challenge of win
ning independence, writing a con
stitution, establishing a central
government—in short, founding a
nation.
THE PROBLEMS OF states
manship in 1961 are different, but
they are certainly no less formid
able. If challenge alone were
enough to call forth greatness,
thi§ should be a golden age of poli
tical leadership.
A second explanation for the
18th century’s fertility in produc
ing statesmen, Commager be
lieves, can be found in the narrow
ness of opportunity which prevail
ed in the raw new republic. There
was no chance for a man of genius
to win renown, as he might have
done in Europe, through a mili
tary career or by rising to emi
nence in an established church or
an ancient university. The talent
ed 18th century American really
had only one arena—public life—
in which to show his mettle. He
went into politics because that was
the only kind of leadership ca
reer open to him.
Today the situation is just the
opposite “Openings, - indeed .invi
tations- are innumerable, and tal
ent finds more glittering rewards
in private than in public enter
prise.”
COMMAGER says modern
America can and must take steps
to “restore the balance” and make
public service once more attrac
tive to men of great ability.
This will require the creation of
a better equilibrium between the
salaries paid to those who carry
heavy public responsibilities and
those who work in similar jobs in
private business. It also' calls for
giving public servants greater pro
tection against unwarranted abuse
from political demagogues, con
gressional investigators, and
“journalists who yield nothing to
these investigators in 1 heir con
tempt for privacy and for do
conev.”

18th century flowering of political
leadership was education a type
of education which placed heavy
emphasis on history and the clas
sics, and which instilled in young
men “an avid sense of duty and of
civic virtue.”
“It is customary now,” Com
mager writes, “to disparage 18th
