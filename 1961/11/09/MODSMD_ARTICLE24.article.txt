# Walter Lippmann Outcome at the U.N.
## 
### 
The outcome at the U.N. in New
York, now that U Thant of Burma
has been elected Secretary Gener
al, is very much better than many
of us thought possible immediate
ly after the death of Dag Hammar
skjold. It looked then as if the So
viet Union would insist on the troi
ka three co-equal Secretaries
General—and would use its veto
to prevent the election of any one
Secretary General.
This has not happened. The So
viet Union has receded from the
troika principle, even in the atten
uated form of three deputies who
would have to be unanimous be
fore the Secretary General could
act. The settlement was arrived
at in New York after six or seven
weeks of quiet and very skillful
diplomacy.

It leaves U Thant free to name
his own advisers and free, after a
careful attempt to got agreement
among them, to make his own de
cisions. Constitutionally and mor
ally U Thant is free to be as inde
pendent as Dag Hammarskjold
was.

THE PREDOMINANT vice of
the troika as applied to the Secre
tary General of the U.N. is not
that it would introduce the prin
ciple of the veto and of unanimity
into the administration of the Sec
retariat. The principle is already
there because the United Nations
is an organization in which the
great powers have, not merely as
a matter of law but by the fact of
(heir power, a veto on the actions
of the U.N. They can always frus
trate an action even if they have
been overruled.

Dag Hammarsk.iold, with his ex
traordinary diplomatic skill, was
able to do many things that the
Soviet Union could have prevented
had it at the time thought it vital
to do so.
In Laos, in Palestine, and in the
early phase of the Congo, the So
viet Union’s inherent power of ve
to was not exercised. But at the
turning point in the Congo, the
power of veto was set in motion
by the Soviet Union. Were Dag
Hammarskjold alive today he
would be bound to recognize the
reality of this veto.
THE REAL VICE of the troika
is that it would destroy what may
well bo the greatest, although it is
the least advertised, of the func
tions of the Secretary General.
This is to be a father confessor to
the member governments, to be
the man in whom they can confide,
and who knows, therefore, from
continual, private, privileged in
formation the real position in an
international controversy. This
knowledge enables him to medi
ate.
Without this confidential rela
tionship ho would have to rely on
public declarations, which are in
fact often quite different from the
true negotiating position. With the
troika this confidential relation
ship to all the governments would
disappear, and each delegate
would then tell the Secretary Gen
eral only what he was prepared to
have his opponent know the next
morning.

The negotiations in New York
have preserved the greatest func
tion of the Secretary General,
which is to be the mediator. How
was this done?

IT WAS DONE by the mass of
the small, weak, and unaligned
countries who rallied to the United
Nations because it is their only
means of playing a self-respecting
part in international affairs. U
Thant is from Burma, one of the
nations to which the U.N. is a pri
mary interest, not as with the
great powers, a secondary matter.
This means that ho comes to his
task with a strong impulse to
make the United Nations a going
concern.

Mr. Adlai Stevenson would be
the last, I imagine, to call the re
sult of I he part he played a victory
over the Soviet Union. A really
good diplomat does not go in lor
victories even when he wins them.
For the essence of a diplomatic
success is that the contenders can

accept the result without loss of
face. A good diplomat, like the old
Chinese warlords, never destroys
the last bridge over which the en
emy could retreat.
WHAT MR. Stevenson has done
these past six weeks is to use the
influence of the United States to
help the weaker nations save the
U.N. Only a wise, experienced, pa
tient, and self-effacing man could
have done it.

Nobody can possibly predict
how, in the unforeseeable con
glomeration of events, U Thant
will act. No doubt he will seek to
mediate conflicts as, when, and if
he can get combined support of
the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. How
this combined support will work
out depends ultimately on wheth
er the East-West tension increases
or is reduced.
U Thant comes to this crucial
problem as a diplomat and scholar
who has read and pondered history
in a long perspective. He is not, I
think, profoundly impressed with
the ideological conflict, and his
disposition is to look at interna
tional politics as Palmerston look
ed at them, as changing antagon
isms and alliances of governments
promoting and protecting what
they regard as their interests.
BECAUSE this is his philosophy
of history and also, it may be, be
cause Burma has a common fron
tier with Red China, he is disposed
to regard the conflict of the West
with Moscow as no more perma
nent than was its conflict with
Germany or with Japan.
We shall find that although U
Thant comes from a new state, he
is the product of an ancient cul
ture which, as he knows well, has
a common origin with that of the
Mediterranean and of the Western
world.

the last, I imagine, to call the re
sult of I he part he played a victory
over the Soviet Union. A really
good diplomat does not go in lor
victories even when he wins them.
For the essence of a diplomatic
success is that the contenders can

accept the result without loss of

Chinese warlords, never destroys
the last bridge over which the en

WHAT MR. Stevenson has done
these past six weeks is to use the
influence of the United States to
help the weaker nations save the
U.N. Only a wise, experienced, pa

have done it.

Nobody can possibly predict
how, in the unforeseeable con
glomeration of events, U Thant
will act. No doubt he will seek to
mediate conflicts as, when, and if
he can get combined support of
the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. How
this combined support will work
out depends ultimately on wheth

U Thant comes to this crucial
problem as a diplomat and scholar
who has read and pondered history
in a long perspective. He is not, I
think, profoundly impressed with
the ideological conflict, and his
disposition is to look at interna

isms and alliances of governments
promoting and protecting what
they regard as their interests.
BECAUSE this is his philosophy
of history and also, it may be, be

to regard the conflict of the West

Germany or with Japan.

is the product of an ancient cul

a common origin with that of the

The outcome at the U.N. in New
York, now that U Thant of Burma
has been elected Secretary Gener
al, is very much better than many
of us thought possible immediate
ly after the death of Dag Hammar
skjold. It looked then as if the So
viet Union would insist on the troi
ka three co-equal Secretaries
General—and would use its veto
to prevent the election of any one
Secretary General.
This has not happened. The So
viet Union has receded from the
troika principle, even in the atten
uated form of three deputies who
would have to be unanimous be
fore the Secretary General could
act. The settlement was arrived
at in New York after six or seven
weeks of quiet and very skillful
diplomacy.

It leaves U Thant free to name
his own advisers and free, after a
careful attempt to got agreement
among them, to make his own de
cisions. Constitutionally and mor
ally U Thant is free to be as inde
pendent as Dag Hammarskjold
was.

THE PREDOMINANT vice of
the troika as applied to the Secre
tary General of the U.N. is not
that it would introduce the prin
ciple of the veto and of unanimity
into the administration of the Sec
retariat. The principle is already
there because the United Nations
is an organization in which the
great powers have, not merely as
a matter of law but by the fact of
(heir power, a veto on the actions
of the U.N. They can always frus
trate an action even if they have
been overruled.

Dag Hammarsk.iold, with his ex
traordinary diplomatic skill, was
able to do many things that the
Soviet Union could have prevented
had it at the time thought it vital
to do so.
In Laos, in Palestine, and in the
early phase of the Congo, the So
viet Union’s inherent power of ve
to was not exercised. But at the
turning point in the Congo, the
power of veto was set in motion
by the Soviet Union. Were Dag
Hammarskjold alive today he
would be bound to recognize the
reality of this veto.
THE REAL VICE of the troika
is that it would destroy what may
well bo the greatest, although it is
the least advertised, of the func
tions of the Secretary General.
This is to be a father confessor to
the member governments, to be
the man in whom they can confide,
and who knows, therefore, from
continual, private, privileged in
formation the real position in an
international controversy. This
knowledge enables him to medi
ate.
Without this confidential rela
tionship ho would have to rely on
public declarations, which are in
fact often quite different from the
true negotiating position. With the
troika this confidential relation
ship to all the governments would
disappear, and each delegate
would then tell the Secretary Gen
eral only what he was prepared to
have his opponent know the next
morning.

The negotiations in New York
have preserved the greatest func
tion of the Secretary General,
which is to be the mediator. How
was this done?

IT WAS DONE by the mass of
the small, weak, and unaligned
countries who rallied to the United
Nations because it is their only
means of playing a self-respecting
part in international affairs. U
Thant is from Burma, one of the
nations to which the U.N. is a pri
mary interest, not as with the
great powers, a secondary matter.
This means that ho comes to his
task with a strong impulse to
make the United Nations a going
concern.

traordinary diplomatic skill, was
able to do many things that the
Soviet Union could have prevented
had it at the time thought it vital
to do so.
In Laos, in Palestine, and in the
early phase of the Congo, the So
viet Union’s inherent power of ve
to was not exercised. But at the
turning point in the Congo, the
power of veto was set in motion
by the Soviet Union. Were Dag
Hammarskjold alive today he
would be bound to recognize the
reality of this veto.
THE REAL VICE of the troika
is that it would destroy what may
well bo the greatest, although it is
the least advertised, of the func
tions of the Secretary General.
This is to be a father confessor to
the member governments, to be
the man in whom they can confide,
and who knows, therefore, from
continual, private, privileged in
formation the real position in an
international controversy. This
knowledge enables him to medi
ate.
Without this confidential rela
tionship ho would have to rely on
public declarations, which are in
fact often quite different from the
true negotiating position. With the
troika this confidential relation
ship to all the governments would
disappear, and each delegate
would then tell the Secretary Gen
eral only what he was prepared to
have his opponent know the next
morning.

The negotiations in New York
have preserved the greatest func
tion of the Secretary General,
which is to be the mediator. How
was this done?

IT WAS DONE by the mass of
the small, weak, and unaligned
countries who rallied to the United
Nations because it is their only
means of playing a self-respecting
part in international affairs. U
Thant is from Burma, one of the
nations to which the U.N. is a pri
mary interest, not as with the
great powers, a secondary matter.
This means that ho comes to his
task with a strong impulse to
make the United Nations a going
concern.

Mr. Adlai Stevenson would be
the last, I imagine, to call the re
sult of I he part he played a victory
over the Soviet Union. A really
good diplomat does not go in lor
victories even when he wins them.
For the essence of a diplomatic
success is that the contenders can

accept the result without loss of
face. A good diplomat, like the old
Chinese warlords, never destroys
the last bridge over which the en
emy could retreat.
WHAT MR. Stevenson has done
these past six weeks is to use the
influence of the United States to
help the weaker nations save the
U.N. Only a wise, experienced, pa
tient, and self-effacing man could
have done it.

Nobody can possibly predict
how, in the unforeseeable con
glomeration of events, U Thant
will act. No doubt he will seek to
mediate conflicts as, when, and if
he can get combined support of
the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. How
this combined support will work
out depends ultimately on wheth
er the East-West tension increases
or is reduced.
U Thant comes to this crucial
problem as a diplomat and scholar
who has read and pondered history
in a long perspective. He is not, I
think, profoundly impressed with
the ideological conflict, and his
disposition is to look at interna
tional politics as Palmerston look
ed at them, as changing antagon
isms and alliances of governments
promoting and protecting what
they regard as their interests.
BECAUSE this is his philosophy
of history and also, it may be, be
cause Burma has a common fron
tier with Red China, he is disposed
to regard the conflict of the West
with Moscow as no more perma
nent than was its conflict with
Germany or with Japan.
We shall find that although U
Thant comes from a new state, he
is the product of an ancient cul
ture which, as he knows well, has
a common origin with that of the
Mediterranean and of the Western
world.

The outcome at the U.N. in New
York, now that U Thant of Burma
has been elected Secretary Gener
al, is very much better than many
of us thought possible immediate
ly after the death of Dag Hammar
skjold. It looked then as if the So
viet Union would insist on the troi
ka three co-equal Secretaries
General—and would use its veto
to prevent the election of any one
Secretary General.
This has not happened. The So
viet Union has receded from the
troika principle, even in the atten
uated form of three deputies who
would have to be unanimous be
fore the Secretary General could
act. The settlement was arrived
at in New York after six or seven
weeks of quiet and very skillful
diplomacy.

It leaves U Thant free to name
his own advisers and free, after a
careful attempt to got agreement
among them, to make his own de
cisions. Constitutionally and mor
ally U Thant is free to be as inde
pendent as Dag Hammarskjold
was.

THE PREDOMINANT vice of
the troika as applied to the Secre
tary General of the U.N. is not
that it would introduce the prin
ciple of the veto and of unanimity
into the administration of the Sec
retariat. The principle is already
there because the United Nations
is an organization in which the
great powers have, not merely as
a matter of law but by the fact of
(heir power, a veto on the actions
of the U.N. They can always frus
trate an action even if they have
been overruled.
