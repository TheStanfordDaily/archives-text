# Surprises Abroad for U.S. Students

### CLAIRE COX 
NEW YORK (UPl)—American
students are writing home from
foreign universities that obtaining
a higher education abroad is far
different from attending dear old
Siwash.
Whether they expected it or not.
the college students who went
overseas this fall for all or part of
their work toward degrees are re
ceiving many surprises.
Some of the features of study
abroad are described in detail in a
guide to the principal universities
of the world published by Pan
American World Airways as part
of its “Now Horizons” series. This
volume deals with “New Horizons
in Education,” and it begins with
a series of discussions by promi
nent Americans.
KENNETH HOLLAND, presl
dent of the Institute of Interna
tional Education, organized in
1919 to foster international stu
dent exchanges, observes that the
U.S. educational system is unique
in philosophy, content and tech
niques.
In the first place, he says, there
is no such thing as working one’s
way through college abroad. Nor
are scholarships available for un
dergraduate study in anything
like the number and size of those
provided in the United States.
What scholarships there are over
seas usually are awarded a year
in advance.

Students applying for accept
ance in foreign universities should
describe their qualifications and
degree goals in plain American. If
they do not, they may run into a
few surprises. For example, if a
student tells French authorities
that he holds a “baccalaureate,”
meaning a bachelor’s degi'ee, he
may wind up as a college fresh
man. for baccalaureate in French
means a high school diploma.

HOLLAND assures an Ameri
can student he need not feel of
fended, however, if, when he seeks
a master’s degree from an English
university, he winds up with a
B.A. Honours degree. This degree
requires a minimum of two years
of hai d work for an American col
lege graduate.
There are other surprises for

the student who does not do his
homework thoroughly before de
parting for a foreign university.
existent overseas, which means
students must find their own hous
ing. The universities do not oper
ate on credit systems and the su
pervision offered in American
schools is absent, which leaves the
student more to his own resources
and encourages independent
study.
Probably the sharpest contrast
is offered by Latin American in
stitutions of higher learning, ac
cording to this guidebook to for
eign study. Most of the Latin
American universities are without
conventional campuses, organized
sports or university clubs. Stu
dents are more interested in public
affairs than collegiate socializing.
THERE ARE FEW full-time
teachers or administrators in col
leges south of the border. Most
classes are taught by business and
professional men who take time
out from their careers two or three
hours a week to give lectures.

This means students must do a
considerable amount of independ
ent studying.
In a complete turnaround, the
academic year in Latin America
usually runs from February,
March or April to November or
December, because the seasons are
reversed. That means that an
American who spends his summer
studying in Brazil or Argentine
actually is attending “winter
school.’’

the college students who went
overseas this fall for all or part of
their work toward degrees are re

Some of the features of study
abroad are described in detail in a

of the world published by Pan
American World Airways as part

in Education,” and it begins with
a series of discussions by promi

KENNETH HOLLAND, presl
dent of the Institute of Interna
tional Education, organized in
1919 to foster international stu
dent exchanges, observes that the
U.S. educational system is unique
in philosophy, content and tech
niques.
In the first place, he says, there
is no such thing as working one’s
way through college abroad. Nor
are scholarships available for un
dergraduate study in anything
like the number and size of those
provided in the United States.
What scholarships there are over
seas usually are awarded a year
in advance.

Students applying for accept
ance in foreign universities should
describe their qualifications and
degree goals in plain American. If
they do not, they may run into a
few surprises. For example, if a
student tells French authorities
that he holds a “baccalaureate,”
meaning a bachelor’s degi'ee, he
may wind up as a college fresh
man. for baccalaureate in French
means a high school diploma.

HOLLAND assures an Ameri
can student he need not feel of
fended, however, if, when he seeks
a master’s degree from an English
university, he winds up with a
B.A. Honours degree. This degree
requires a minimum of two years
of hai d work for an American col
lege graduate.

homework thoroughly before de
parting for a foreign university.

students must find their own hous
ing. The universities do not oper
ate on credit systems and the su
pervision offered in American
schools is absent, which leaves the
student more to his own resources
and encourages independent
study.
Probably the sharpest contrast
is offered by Latin American in
stitutions of higher learning, ac
cording to this guidebook to for
eign study. Most of the Latin
American universities are without
conventional campuses, organized
sports or university clubs. Stu
dents are more interested in public
affairs than collegiate socializing.
THERE ARE FEW full-time
teachers or administrators in col
leges south of the border. Most
classes are taught by business and
professional men who take time
out from their careers two or three
hours a week to give lectures.

This means students must do a
considerable amount of independ
ent studying.

academic year in Latin America
