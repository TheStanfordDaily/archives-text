# SEEK FIRST LEAGUE WIN
## Card Gridders Up for Clash With Trojans in LA Saturday 
### 
Stanford’s varsity football team
will be seeking its first AAWU
conference win in three years
when I he Card eleven invades Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum for
an encounter with USC's pennant
seeking Trojans.
The Troymen must win this
one to slay in the Big Five race
witir UCLA's high flying Bruins.
But the Indians are in no mood
to be charitable. Currently on a
three-game losing binge, Stanford
will be up for the clash with USC
in order to get back on the win
trail.
AT PRESENT the Card grid
dors sport a 3-4 won-lost record
with wins over Tulane, Oregon
State and San Jose State, while
winding up oir the short end
against Michigan State, Washing
ton, UCLA and Oregon.
Needless to say. the Indians
would like nothing better than
a win against the Trojans to start
them out on an end of-1 he-season
flourish.
Of late the Tribe gridders have
been marked by an inability to
put the pigskin across the goal
line. With USC’s new-found de
fensive strength, picked up
against Washington last week,
Stanford will have one of their
tougher fights up front this
week.
THE INDIAN offense will still
he hampered by a lion’s share of
injuries. Tony DeLellis, out with
a strained back in last week’s
contest with Oregon, reinjured
himself in last night’s contact
workout. The junior fullback is
only doubtful for this weekend’s
clash.
Another fullback, Jay Ward,
who was only moved up to the
varsity three weeks ago, strained
his knee against Oregon Satur
day and it’s doubtful that he will
see any action this week.
Gary Sargent, stellar defensive
back, is down with a sprained
ankle and is extremely unlikely
to play against the Trojans.
IT IS NOT all bad news for
the Cards, however, as tackle A1
Hildebrand has been given the
green light to return to action,
and sophomore end Frank Patj
tucci, who has been slowed down
with charleyhorses, will probably
be okay by Saturday.
Healthy and hoping to help
make the Stanford offense go in
the backfield will he Stan Lind
skog and Danny Spence at left
and right halfback respectively.
Lindskog has been the workhorse
of the Card backfield of late, car
rying the ball 37 times in seven
games.
Spence is the leading Stanford
rusher with a total gain of 103
yards in 10 carries for a 3,42
yards per carry average.
Little Ken Babajian should be
at fullback to put some punch
in the Indian attack.
ALL THREE of Stanford quar
terbacks Jim Smith, Rod Sears
and Chuck Butler will have an
opportunity to man the signal
calling post, but Smith has been
working with the first team and
is slated to open there.
Saturday should see Steve Pur
sell and George Honore at the
offensive end spots for the Indi
ans. Honore is Stanford’s leading
pass receiver with 22 catches for
225 yards, about twice as many
as his nearest competitor, Pur
sell, Chuck McCormick will be
at right end on defense.
Tackles will be Chuck Buehler
and Randy Vahan on offense and
Vahan, Hildebrand or Frank At
kinson on defense.
OFFENSIVE guards will he
Frank Dubofsky and Tom Walsh
who will be spelled on defense
by Marv Harris and Erroll Scott.
Chris Cottle, one of this week’s
game co-captains along with Jack
Gordon, will see starting duty at
center with John Butler, out
standing lineman against Oregon,
taking over as linebacker on de
fense.
Rounding out the Stanford
starting 22 will be linebacker Ed
Cummings, picked as the out
standing back in the Oregon
game, safety Gary Craig and
halfback Jim Shroyer.


DANNY SPENCE, a sophomore halfback from Wilmington, Calif.,
is the current rushing leader for the Card gridders. Averaging 5.42
yards per carry in 19 attempts, the 5-11, 181-pound Spence will
open at right half when Stanford invades Trojanland this Saturday.
