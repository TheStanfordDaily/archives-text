# Path Cleared For Union-Goers
## 
### 
A change in traffic flow on Pan
ama St. now makes it easier to
get to Union Residence, Police
Chief Gordon Davis has noted.
Panama is now oneway from
Lornita to Union, and the parallel
strip on the Quad side of the row
of trees lining Panama has been
cleared of equipment and made
one-way from Union back to Lo
mita.
Panama was formerly one-way
out of Union, and to get in one had
to take Santa Theresa to Duena
St. back of the Union.
Obstruction in this route from
construction of the new union was
one reason for the change made
about a week ago, Davis said.
