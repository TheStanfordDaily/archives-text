# Today Last Day For ASSU Vote
## 
### 
Students have their last chance
to vote in (ho ASSU final elections
today from 8:30 to 3 at Engineer
ing Corner and the Post Office.
Freshmen will elect class presi
dent and vice president and
LASSU representatives from Ro
ble and Wilbur. All men may vote
for a member to Men’s Council.
Women, except freshmen, have no
one to vote for.
Only about 900 voters trickled
to the polls yesterday for an un
usually light turnout. Most of
those who did vote were freshmen,
according to poll workers’ opin
ions.
Campus-wide interest in the elec
tion dropped when the race for
head yell leader evaporated Tues
day. Roger Solquist was declared
elected by the Elections Commis
sion when injuries forced his op
ponent, John Jones to withdraw.
Final election results will be
posted periodically in the union
as ballots are counted. First tabu
lations should be ready by 4 p.m.
