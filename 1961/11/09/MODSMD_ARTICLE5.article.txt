LOS ANGELES (UPD The
Bel Air-Brentwood fire, worst in
Los Angeles history, destroyed
447 homes and leveled almost
6,000 acres of valuable watershed,
the fire department said in a final
estimate issued yesterday.
THE FIRE was contained Tues
day night. A second major blaze
in Topanga Canyon was being
held in check last night and con
tainment was expected by 8 a.m.
today—barring a shift in winds.
Loss from the Bel Air fire
alone may run from $5O million
to $lOO million, according to un
official estimates. The fire de
partment. after accounting for
earlier errors, said it confirmed
destruction of 447 homes and
burning of countless other
smaller buildings.
Personal property and water
shed weren’t included in esti
mates averaging $60,000 for each
house lost.
THE TOTAL figure was re
vised downward from 461 when
firemen found more than a dozen
houses were counted twice. An
other nine small dwellings were
burned in the Topanga fire—
apart from the Bel Air blaze to
bring the total to 456 for both
disasters.
The fiery “twin” blazes in To
panga Canyon was attacked by
borate bombers and helicopters
which dropped two-man crews to
hot spots in Santa Ynez Canyon
near Pacific Palisades.
