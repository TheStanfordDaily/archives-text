### ILENE H. STRELITZ 
A Big Sur Lodge site aimed at
becoming a center of arts, crafts
and new University thought, is be
ing opened to Stanford students, it
was revealed last night.
David S. Larimer, Assistant
Dean of Men and several members
of the ASSU Student-Faculty
Board, closed negotiations yester
day afternoon at the “Hot Springs
Lodge,” 14 miles south of Big Sur,
for a program bringing Stanford
students and Stanford professors
into contact in a hostel situation
with the intellectual mileau of the
area.
The new hostels will feature
Stanford professors, just as do
the ones hold at the Stanford
Hostel. At the Big Sur location,
however, the professors will be
augmented by outside people in
the field.
Among those people to be possi
bly featured in the program are
author Henry Miller, noted folk
singer Joan Baez, columnists Herb
Caen and Terrence O’Flaherty.
A speaker bureau for the Stan
ford program will be organized
by former Collier’s editor and
past editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle Paul Smith.
BIG SUR is noted as a gathering
place of the country’s thinkers,
where men of t he calibre of Aldous
Huxley meet for informal discus
sions. It is a center of arts, crafts,
of the avant garde in poetry and
prose.
Former Stanford students Mike
Murphy and Dick Price, partners
in the Hot Springs Lodge, have of
fered to Stanford the opportunity
to take advantage of the area’s of
ferings.

The lodge was built after a 1909
property purchase by Murphy’s
grandfather. At that time, the area
was slated for development as a
resort; for years Indians nearby
had used the hot springs located
on the property for baths. Until
1939, when a road was built into
the area, it was accessible only on
horseback.
Additions were made to the land
periodically, until now there are
12 cabins holding a maximum of
36 people, a restaurant, a swim
ming pool, and of course, the hot
springs. It is the future .plans
though, that lend the Lodge its ap
peal to the Stanford student.
MURPHY AND PRICE, who
graduated in psych from the Farm
in 1952, are planning to erect a
number of shops. There are to be
pottery, woodworking, leal tier
working, saddle making and jewel
ry making shops. Visitors to the
lodge may watch the Big Sur ar
tisans in action. While parents
take advantage of the mineral
springs, children will be taught the
crafts by staying at the workshop.
The many craftsmen in the area
who have little opportunity to be
heard have assured the success of
the venture.
Plans for the Lodge as formu
lated by Murphy’s grandmother
would have converted it to a “mil
lion dollar spa.’’ Murphy and
Price, though, came in as partners
after spending their after-gradua
tion lime thinking and writing. It
is now their plans for arts and
crafts, for Stanford seminars, that
are being implemented. Friends of
Larimer from campus days Mur
phy and Price contacted him; Lar
imer then contacted the Student-
Faculty Board.
As arrangements stand at the
moment, according to Student-
Faculty Board Co-chairmen Bill

Loitz and Ilene Strelitz, the Lodge
owners will contact Stanford when
a speaker is available. Sign-ups
will then be made available to stu
dents and faculty. The opportuni
ty for intensive discussion in an
informal situation with the na
tion’s top names, students and fac
ulty will be something peculiar to
Stanford.
COMBINED WITH the Student
Faculty Board’s recently initiated
“At Home” program, as well as
the existing Hostel program at the
University Hostel, faculty fire
sides, faculty residents, and facul
ty associates, the student-faculty
activities can lead to a stimulation
of close contact and thought
among students and professor-s,
and now, the country’s lop “out
side” intellects as well.

Big Sur Hostels will be
brought into reality quickly, as
one is already set for January 2.
While this is a private one, for
LASSU, the near future will see an
all-University Hostel at Hot
Springs.
The first Stanford Big Sur Hos
tel will bring two as yet un
named Stanford professors to
gether with students and Pierre
DeLaittre. DeLaittre is noted for
his conversion to the “cult of the
beat’’ after being sent out to San
Francisco’s so-called beatnik area
to help the residents “straighten
themselves out.’’
The first Hostel will be held
January 20, Sign ups will be an
nounced, as will the hosting pro
fessors.
Sign-ups are currently under
way for tomorrow’s Hostel fea
turing Dr. William Linvill and
Harold Stevens, respectively of
the electronics and political sci
ence departments. Sign-ups are
at the ASSU office; a $3 fee
covers Iho overnight event.
