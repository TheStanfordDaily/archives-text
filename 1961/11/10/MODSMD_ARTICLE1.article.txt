# Englishman Green Delivers 'Dynamic, Intellectual Gospel'

### PETER GROTHE 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Peter
Grot he, graduate st udent in politi
cal science, is a close friend of
('anon Bryan Green, I lie renowned
Anglican clergyman who will con
duct a series of lectures at Stan
ford next week. Here is Grothe’s
personality sketch of Green.)

Canon Bryan Green, the dynam
ic English minister who drew
crowds totalling 20,000 in five days
at Stanford in 1954, is orthodox in
his Christian theology, but most
unorthodox in his presentation of
it.

The stories are legion of how the
Anglican clergyman has offended
the rule books. Perhaps the best
known one concerns the Bishop
and the blessing.
Several years ago, Green preach
ed at an Episcopal Church in New
York which he described as the
most hypocritical one in which he
had over been. He has an amazing
audience perception, and he de
scribed the situation this way:
“FOR THE FIRST time in my
life, I felt there was a real wall be
tween me and the congregation. I
knew there was something terri
bly wrong there.”
Green announced to the congre
gation that after the sermon there
would be a minute of silent prayer
and then the Bishop would give
the blessing. After the silent pray
er, the Bishop raised his hand to
give the blessing, and at this point
Green was struck with a sudden
impulse. He said he had never
done this before, and he would
never do it again, but he had to do
it now.

He blurted out. “Wait a minute,
Bishop, don’t bless them; they
don’t deserve it.’’
THE BISHOP’S hand, which
was raised high, quavered down
to his side. The congregation was
thunderstruck they’d never ex
perienced anything like this be
fore. Green turned to the congre
gation and said, “That’s all, be off
with you. Go home. You don’t de
serve a blessing.”
Green learned that, in fact, the
congregation was split from top
to bottom with warring groups,
some of whom wouldn’t even
speak with the rector. The inter
esting conclusion to the story is
that Green later learned that
from that day on, the congrega
tion had a spiritual rebirth. Appar
ently, he had shocked them out of
their ways.
Another time when Green
countered tradition was the occa
sion when he was asked at an
American high school assembly if
it was all right to swear. He told
them it was all right to swear, as
long as they used just certain
swear words, and then he proceed
ed to list the words.
“IT SHOOK the teachers rigid,”
he recounts.
While speaking before the
League of Atheists at Columbia
University Green converted the
President. He recalled, “It was
quite disconcerting to the League
of Atheists they had to get a new
President.”
The administration of a leading
Eastern women’s college cancelled
Green’s lecture series in the mid
dle, because they considered him
too controversial. He merely rent
ed a movie theater in a nearby
town, and the girls all flocked out

to hear him.
WHEN GREEN held his five
day mission at Stanford in 1954,
Prof. J. T. Watkins IV of the De
partment of Political Science com
mented, “In the 25 years I've been
at Stanford, I've never seen any
one have the impact on the stu
dents that Bryan Green has had."
Green's gifts are several: He
combines brilliance with an in
credible reserve of energy, a dis
tinct touch of humanness, and the
wit of an Alec Guinness comedy.
He understands the logical, ques
tioning college mind, and in talk
ing religion, he doesn’t make a
person leave his intellect at home.
He is of the conviction that “re
ligion is not dully good, but dy
namically good.”
He believes profoundly in relat
ing Christianity to social issues.
He has often said, “I can think of
nothing more dismal than preach
ing the Gospel unrelated to life.”
THE CHURCH of England cler
gyman is rector of the largest
church in Birmingham, the second
largest city in Britain. He spends
nine months a year in Birming
ham and three months a year trav
eling around the world preaching.
He has been described as the “best
orator in the Anglican Church,”
and is normally booked about
three years in advance.
He writes for some of England’s
largest dailies, has TV and radio
programs, and has written several
books. At one time, he was Chap
lain at Oxford University.
Green prefers talking to athe
ists and agnostics over committed
Christians. "After all,” he says
with a twinkle in his eye, “It’s no
fun if everyone sits around agree
ing with each other.”
