## 
### 
• WASHINGTON (UPH Presi
dent Kennedy and Indian Prime
Minister JavVaharlal Nehru called
yesterday for a nuclear test ban
treaty “with necessary provision
for inspection and control.”
But Kennedy told Nehru, ac
cording to a communique, that
the United States is unwilling to
accept another uncontrolled mora
torium on atomic tests.
THE COMMUNIQUE made
plain that Kennedy had ruled out
any acceptance of an uncontrolled
test ban because of the Soviet
resumption of tests “which broke
the previous moratorium.”
The joint communique winding
up a four-day visit by the Indian
leader said their talks had been
“especially pleasant and reward
ing.”
Kennedy and Nehru promised
to “keep closely in touch with
each other in the months and
years ahead.” The prime minister
had said earlier that he had in
vited Kennedy to India and hoped
the President could make it a
year from this winter. But Ken
nedy told reporters he had no
plans now to go there.
ON BERLIN, the communique
said that “the President and the
prime minister concurred in the
legitimate and necessary right of
access to Berlin.”
Kennedy, it added, assured
Nehru that every effort would
be made to seek a solution of the
Berlin problem by peaceful
means.
The communique avoided any
open reference to Communist
threats to Laos and South Viet
nam. It did say that both India
and the United States wanted
Laos to be genuinely neutral.
But in an apparent reference to
South Viet Nam, now attacked
by Communist guerrillas, the
communique said both nations
agreed that each nation in the
Southeat Asia area should “have
the opportunity to make its own
choice on the course it will take
in seeking to solve pressing eco
nomic and social problems under
conditions of peace.”
