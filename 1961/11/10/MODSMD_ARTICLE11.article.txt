# Dekes Revive Grape Stomp
## 
### 
Tomorrow at 2 p.m. at
Searsville Lake Stanford stu
dents will get their first
chance in five years to see
what it was really like in the
old days.
The Deke all-campus Grape
Stomp is being revived and
promises to pick up where the
last one left off in 1955.
A student body card and 50
cents will open the gates on a
wondrous supply of grape
juice and the rock-and-roll
music of Billy Calhoun and
his six-piece combo.
The festivities, including
the USC game via radio, are
scheduled to end at 6 p.m., but
if the grapes are still being
stomped. . . .
