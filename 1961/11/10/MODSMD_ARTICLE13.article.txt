# BOOK REVIEW
## Salinger Presents Some Variations on a Theme 
### JUDY SKLAR Associate Editor 
It is altogether too evident, when
ads from Little, Brown and Co.
start appearing in The Stanford
Daily, that some literary event has
taken place.
There is perhaps only one writer
in the world who could inspire this
kind of action on the part of his
publisher, and that writer is J. D.
Salinger. The occasion is the pub
lication of two stories, “Franny.”
and “Zooey,” printed in The New
Yorker in the mid-1950’5, in a hard
back edition. The immediate re
action was a Time cover story for
Salinger and the addition of a sim
ple white, black and green volume
to the list of status items for the
college student.
The book, in the tradition of
“The Catcher in the Rye,” is about
the good, the phony and the abili
ty of those not yet classed as
adults to tell which is which.
THE TWO stories of the Glass
family are contiguous in time, and
both deal with Franny’s spiritual
crisis. The first is a short story,
and the second is a novella, but
could more properly be classed (in
the words of its narrator) as a
“prose home movie.” And in spite
of Buddy Glass’s firm statement
to the contrary, both of their plots
hinge on “mysticism or religious
mystification.”
Franny’s crisis has been brought,
on by the phony and egotistical
life of a college campus, but Zooey
extends its application to the
world in general as well. Franny
has renounced the world entirely,
and it is Zooey’s job to bring her
back to living it it. As Mrs. Glass
puts it “you can’t live in the
world with such strong likes and
dislikes.”
Franny’s football weekend with
Lane Coutell, The Undergraduate,
brings to a climax the great dis
gust and disillusionment that she
feels with the egotistic college
community, from which she tries
to escape by means of the Jesus
Prayer.
THE PRAYER comes from a
small green book, “The Way of a
Pilgrim,” that belonged to her
brother Seymour, the oldest of the
seven Glass children, and it is
part of the education in religious
wisdom inculcated in Franny and
Zooey by the older Glasses.
The Jesus Prayer is the device
in both stories that is supposed to

make them profound. In “The
Catcher in the Rye” it was the
catcher in the rye, and it worked
there because Holden Caulfield,
even if he were the catcher in the
rye, was still a genuine person. But
Franny is being a bit of a phony
herself in using the Jesus Prayer,
even if she does have a solid
Buddhist and “It’s a Wise Child”
background.
Salinger seems too involved with
his characters to let them function
by themselves. He loves them too
much, and the book suffers be
cause of it. The description and
the prose are self-conscious. And
he is self-conscious about letting
both Franny and Zooey show
themselves to the world.
ZOOEY’S CRUCIAL talk with
Franny at the end of “Zooey” is
extremely painful to read. Talks
with big brother are no fun for
anyone, even if the brother is
Zooey who just had a delightful
80-page long conversation with his
mother while he was in the bath
tub. Salinger loses his sense of hu
mor, even with the italicized dia
logue. It Is a self-conscious scene.
The reader sems to be intruding.
Franny’s boyfriend, Lane Cou
tell, is crass and self-centered, but
he is not so totally unsympathetic
as he is perhaps intended to be.
Even with his clumsiness, he is
genuinely concerned about Fran
ny, and he certainly has a much
greater grasp of reality than she.
In spite of the partially self
conscious quality of the stories,
they are—because Salinger inev
itably is—basically compassionate
and honest. The book is not the
masterpiece that “Catcher in the
Rye” is, but it is extremely inter
esting in terms of Salinger.
THE PROSE is masterful, clean,
his observation-of detail in terms
of people is, as always, superb.
And both are always relevant to in
troversion that comprises the bulk
of the stories.

The book is addressed primarily
to the college community, and its
criticisms of both students and
faculty do warrant examining, pre
cisely because of Salinger’s hon
esty. The way out may not be the
Jesus Prayer, but one must still
find away to live in the world and
not be taken in by its phonies.
Salinger’s expression of this con
flict in dramatic and particular
people is, without doubt, well
worth reading.

extremely painful to read. Talks
with big brother are no fun for
anyone, even if the brother is
Zooey who just had a delightful
80-page long conversation with his
mother while he was in the bath
tub. Salinger loses his sense of hu
mor, even with the italicized dia
logue. It Is a self-conscious scene.
The reader sems to be intruding.
Franny’s boyfriend, Lane Cou
tell, is crass and self-centered, but
he is not so totally unsympathetic
as he is perhaps intended to be.
Even with his clumsiness, he is
genuinely concerned about Fran
ny, and he certainly has a much
greater grasp of reality than she.
In spite of the partially self
conscious quality of the stories,
they are—because Salinger inev
itably is—basically compassionate
and honest. The book is not the
masterpiece that “Catcher in the
Rye” is, but it is extremely inter
esting in terms of Salinger.
THE PROSE is masterful, clean,
his observation-of detail in terms
of people is, as always, superb.
And both are always relevant to in
troversion that comprises the bulk
of the stories.

The book is addressed primarily
to the college community, and its
criticisms of both students and
faculty do warrant examining, pre
cisely because of Salinger’s hon
esty. The way out may not be the
Jesus Prayer, but one must still
find away to live in the world and
not be taken in by its phonies.
Salinger’s expression of this con
flict in dramatic and particular
people is, without doubt, well
worth reading.
It is altogether too evident, when
ads from Little, Brown and Co.
start appearing in The Stanford
Daily, that some literary event has
taken place.
There is perhaps only one writer
in the world who could inspire this
kind of action on the part of his
publisher, and that writer is J. D.
Salinger. The occasion is the pub
lication of two stories, “Franny.”
and “Zooey,” printed in The New
Yorker in the mid-1950’5, in a hard
back edition. The immediate re
action was a Time cover story for
Salinger and the addition of a sim
ple white, black and green volume
to the list of status items for the
college student.
The book, in the tradition of
“The Catcher in the Rye,” is about
the good, the phony and the abili
ty of those not yet classed as
adults to tell which is which.
THE TWO stories of the Glass
family are contiguous in time, and
both deal with Franny’s spiritual
crisis. The first is a short story,
and the second is a novella, but
could more properly be classed (in
the words of its narrator) as a
“prose home movie.” And in spite
of Buddy Glass’s firm statement
to the contrary, both of their plots
hinge on “mysticism or religious
mystification.”
Franny’s crisis has been brought,
on by the phony and egotistical
life of a college campus, but Zooey
extends its application to the
world in general as well. Franny
has renounced the world entirely,
and it is Zooey’s job to bring her
back to living it it. As Mrs. Glass
puts it “you can’t live in the
world with such strong likes and
dislikes.”
Franny’s football weekend with
Lane Coutell, The Undergraduate,
brings to a climax the great dis
gust and disillusionment that she
feels with the egotistic college
community, from which she tries
to escape by means of the Jesus
Prayer.
THE PRAYER comes from a
small green book, “The Way of a
Pilgrim,” that belonged to her
brother Seymour, the oldest of the
seven Glass children, and it is
part of the education in religious
wisdom inculcated in Franny and
Zooey by the older Glasses.
The Jesus Prayer is the device
in both stories that is supposed to

make them profound. In “The
Catcher in the Rye” it was the
catcher in the rye, and it worked
there because Holden Caulfield,
even if he were the catcher in the
rye, was still a genuine person. But
Franny is being a bit of a phony
herself in using the Jesus Prayer,
even if she does have a solid
Buddhist and “It’s a Wise Child”
background.
Salinger seems too involved with
his characters to let them function
by themselves. He loves them too
much, and the book suffers be
cause of it. The description and
the prose are self-conscious. And
he is self-conscious about letting
both Franny and Zooey show
themselves to the world.

world in general as well. Franny
has renounced the world entirely,
and it is Zooey’s job to bring her
back to living it it. As Mrs. Glass
puts it “you can’t live in the
world with such strong likes and
dislikes.”
Franny’s football weekend with
Lane Coutell, The Undergraduate,
brings to a climax the great dis
gust and disillusionment that she
feels with the egotistic college
community, from which she tries
to escape by means of the Jesus
Prayer.
THE PRAYER comes from a
small green book, “The Way of a
Pilgrim,” that belonged to her
brother Seymour, the oldest of the
seven Glass children, and it is
part of the education in religious
wisdom inculcated in Franny and
Zooey by the older Glasses.
The Jesus Prayer is the device
in both stories that is supposed to

make them profound. In “The
Catcher in the Rye” it was the
catcher in the rye, and it worked
there because Holden Caulfield,
even if he were the catcher in the
rye, was still a genuine person. But
Franny is being a bit of a phony
herself in using the Jesus Prayer,
even if she does have a solid
Buddhist and “It’s a Wise Child”
background.
Salinger seems too involved with
his characters to let them function
by themselves. He loves them too
much, and the book suffers be
cause of it. The description and
the prose are self-conscious. And
he is self-conscious about letting
both Franny and Zooey show
themselves to the world.
ZOOEY’S CRUCIAL talk with
Franny at the end of “Zooey” is
extremely painful to read. Talks
with big brother are no fun for
anyone, even if the brother is
Zooey who just had a delightful
80-page long conversation with his
mother while he was in the bath
tub. Salinger loses his sense of hu
mor, even with the italicized dia
logue. It Is a self-conscious scene.
The reader sems to be intruding.
Franny’s boyfriend, Lane Cou
tell, is crass and self-centered, but
he is not so totally unsympathetic
as he is perhaps intended to be.
Even with his clumsiness, he is
genuinely concerned about Fran
ny, and he certainly has a much
greater grasp of reality than she.
In spite of the partially self
conscious quality of the stories,
they are—because Salinger inev
itably is—basically compassionate
and honest. The book is not the
masterpiece that “Catcher in the
Rye” is, but it is extremely inter
esting in terms of Salinger.
THE PROSE is masterful, clean,
his observation-of detail in terms
of people is, as always, superb.
And both are always relevant to in
troversion that comprises the bulk
of the stories.

The book is addressed primarily
to the college community, and its
criticisms of both students and
faculty do warrant examining, pre
cisely because of Salinger’s hon
esty. The way out may not be the
Jesus Prayer, but one must still
find away to live in the world and
not be taken in by its phonies.
Salinger’s expression of this con
flict in dramatic and particular
people is, without doubt, well
worth reading.
It is altogether too evident, when
ads from Little, Brown and Co.
start appearing in The Stanford
Daily, that some literary event has
taken place.
There is perhaps only one writer
in the world who could inspire this
kind of action on the part of his
publisher, and that writer is J. D.
Salinger. The occasion is the pub
lication of two stories, “Franny.”
and “Zooey,” printed in The New
Yorker in the mid-1950’5, in a hard
back edition. The immediate re
action was a Time cover story for
Salinger and the addition of a sim
ple white, black and green volume
to the list of status items for the
college student.
The book, in the tradition of
“The Catcher in the Rye,” is about
the good, the phony and the abili
ty of those not yet classed as
adults to tell which is which.
THE TWO stories of the Glass
family are contiguous in time, and
both deal with Franny’s spiritual
crisis. The first is a short story,
and the second is a novella, but
could more properly be classed (in
the words of its narrator) as a
“prose home movie.” And in spite
of Buddy Glass’s firm statement
to the contrary, both of their plots
hinge on “mysticism or religious
mystification.”
