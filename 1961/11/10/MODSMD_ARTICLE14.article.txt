## Head Yell Leader Job A 'Patent Absurdity' 
### DEREK DAVIS Daily Staff Writer 
The growing hubbub over the
function of the Head Yell Leader
in giving proper organization to
obscenities which might otherwise
be lost in badly disunited effort
neglects one important point—the
patent absurdity of the Head Yell
Leader himself.
This does not mean that there
should be no head yell loader. Lit
tle boys will be little boys, and
something must come along to re
inforce the declining popularity of
Mickey Mouse.
Rather, it is the bloodcurdling
thought that Hoad Yell Leader
(would anyone believe such a term
if it appeared in "Brave New
World”?) should be seriously con
sidered as the top elective post on
campus this year. A near parallel
might be the heated campaign in
San Francisco for Chief Streetcor
ner Evangelist or Top-ranking Bus
Conductor Cusser.
GOD KNOWS large elements of
the student body here at Animal
Farm give the University a bad
enough name (there is probably
not a less reputable group at any
highly-ranked institution of learn
ing in the country, if not the hem
isphere), without having their
cruder aims semiofficially em
bodied in a post which has proba
bly been otherwise defunct since
the Imperial Voice Raiser led the
chants of “Lions Si, Christians
No.”
The various praises of obscenity
pouring in are encouraging,
though I think they could serve
better in defense of Henry Miller
than of the local manifestations.
The interesting thing is that in
court decisions on such works as
“Tropic of Cancer” (e.g.. “Ulys
ses,” “Lady Chatterley’s Lover”)
the intentions of the author served
as a deciding factor.
Yet I somehow doubt that the
average student-in-the-stands has
the idea of a social, literary or
moral taste revolution in mind.
I have instead the sneaking sus

picion that he is more interested
in being dirty-for-dirty’s-sake.
After all, if he behaved by himself
in such a manner he would get a
proper kick in the can, poke in the
nose or verbal dressing down.
BUT IN mass he is free to em
barrass those who would other
wise embarrass him for lacking
manners, common sense or regard
for the feelings of his betters.
As to the idea that the limited
vocabulary of four-letter words
employed merely stand as sym
bols for “feces,” “insemination,”
etc.—is there really any greater
reason or justification for jump
ing up and down and yelling “fe
ces” in two-beat rhythm than for
the use of its Anglo-Saxon short
hand form?
After all, the word “feces” is
only a symbol too, so carrying
things to their logical conclu
sion. .. .
But this is still all byplay, a
popular manifestation of the over
all spirit which says “Head Yell
Leader is the pinnacle of campus
success.”
WHILE I WOULD not wish Mr.
Jones any ill, might I suggest that
a few too many candidates have
fallen on their heads before trying
out? How else is one to explain
why someone would strive for the
privilege of making a public ass
of himself every weekend?
This is not rational behavior,
and if one is not to find rational
behavior in one of the “better” uni
versities, where else may it be
ferreted out? Mencken’s Boobus
Americanos may have an even
vaster habitat than originally sus
pected.
But reform is too much to ex
pect. Stanford students will be
Stanford students and Head Yell
Leaders will yell their heads off.
When judgment day comes, we
may well expect to see them fol
lowing the lead of Gabriel’s swing
ing trumpet and calling out, re
plete with all the proper back flips
and mighty leaps: “God is good,
God is great, yeaaaaaaaa GOD!”
