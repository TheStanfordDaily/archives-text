HONOR CODE
Editor, The Daily:
In a recent (Nov. 8) article by
Mr. Carl Mitcham and a letter
(Nov. 9) by Mr. Michael Gagarin,
the desire was expressed for a re
evaluation of the Honor Code, with
the idea of giving the student more
responsibility.
Under the present Honor Code
the student is given privileges

which are a great convenience to
him and which he would not want
to give up. In exchange for these
privileges the student agrees to
accept certain responsibilities
which the students have, on the
whole, been reluctant to carry out.
It seems somewhat premature
to ask for more responsibilities
until we have shown our willing
ness to live up to the present ones.
While some students would wel

come greater freedom and respon
sibility, the present situation
seems to indicate that more em
phasis is placed on privileges than
on responsibilities, with the result
that a minority is permitted to
abuse our privileges because the
majority does not feel strong
enough to take the responsibility
of protecting those privileges from
sometimes flagrant misuse.
