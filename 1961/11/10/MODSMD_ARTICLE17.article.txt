STANFORD OBSCENITY
Editor, The Daily:
Jim Hunter and Bill Rent?,
pointed out that an individual is
offended...by. so-called, ob,scene be
havior. not because of any ele
| merits in the behavior itself, but
I because of the offended individu
al’s conflicting attitudes toward
| bodily functions; I concur with
their view. Nevertheless, I would
like to raise two questions:
1. Since we hypothesize that
| our guests at football games and
Sunday “flicks” are offended by
| common words or actions that re
j fer to bodily functions, why should
this behavior be encouraged?
Is it perhaps not wiser to con
sider their delicate feelings and
j act accordingly 1 1 am assuming
that there is sufficient value in
the football games and Sunday
“flicks” so that guests will wish to
come whether or not they are both
ered by the behavior of the stu
dent ... ) ?
2. ) Is it not reasonable that one’s
behavior is the best indication of
the kind of person who is perform
ing that behavior? Let us assume
for a moment that there are some
guests who feel the same way that
Jim Hunter and Bill Rentz do.
These guests cannot avoid ob-
I serving that the Stanford student
body is overly occupied with be
havior related to the bodily func
tions. Might they not suspect that
the students’ behavior is a symp
tom of a conflict in attitudes .. . ?
My conclusion is as follows:
1. So-called obscenity is not in
appropriate under certain circum
stances; J. D. Salinger, Henry Mil
ler, D. H. Lawrence, and many
other artists use it to considerable
advantage. But, a sensitivity for
the feelings of others dictates cer
tain circumstances in which “ob
scenity,” like noise, should be con
trolled.
2. A few Stanford students
either have extremely limited
imaginations, vocabularies, and
behavior repertoires, or else they
have fundamental conflicts which
concern their bodily functions. I

would suggest to those with the
latter problem that they discuss
their feelings with their doctor.
