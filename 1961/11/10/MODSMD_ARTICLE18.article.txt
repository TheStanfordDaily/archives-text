## Shirer Speech Hit 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow
ing article was submitted as an
open letter to William L. Shirer by-
Antony Alcock, Peter Overdick
and James Sattler.)
We wore very disappointed to
learn on arrival at the Auditorium
that the subject of your talk was
to bo abruptly changed. We were
informed by many people after
your address that they would not
have come had they known what
subject would be discussed.
To our mind your decision im
plies a lack of faith either on your
part or on the part of the organiza
tion which sponsored your speech
to the public and Stanford Univer
sity.
After reading your book, we re
gretfully note that you tend to see
historical and political problems
in absolute terms, thus oversim
plifying exceedingly complex is
sues. Such an approach may be
good enough for the Book of the
Month Club, but we feel that a
University audience deserves
more respect.
PAUL SETIIE, reviewing “The
Rise and Fall of (he Third Reich”
in Die Ziet, No. 43, Oct. 27. 1961,
writes:
“Shirer is an intelligent and
well-read man but his horizon is
narrow. When writing the history
of this period he shows two feel
ings: hatred toward Hitler and
aversion to the German ruling
class.
“If the facts fit into this picture
I hen Shirer relates them precisely
and correctly. But if they don’t fit
in he discards them; if they still
don’t fit he chops them up; and if
that doesn’t help he throws them
away.”
GOEO Mann says in the intro
duction to the German edition:
“Really tragic situations are un
known to this historian.”
We are not sure that you took
these criticisms into consideration
before embarking on the topic of

contemporary Germany. We are
unimpressed by your treatment of
neo-Nazism.
Your distortion of this subject
is a disservice to the American
people. It displays an irresponsi
ble attitude to the German ques
tion, a question which deserves,
especially at this time, an unemo
tional and intellectually objective
approach by the American public,
YOU DOUBT that the German
people have changed. By the very
use of such a generalization you
avoid any consideration of the
complexity of the German nation.
May we call your attention to the
following well-known facts:
1. The electoral decline of the
DRP (German Reich Party).
2. » German mass media are uni
formly anti-Nazi.
3. i The vast majority of Ger
man youth and the intelligentsia
are anti-Nazi and pro-European.
4. German officials are system
matically arresting Nazi crimi
nals. Witness the recent arrest of
Baer (Auschwitz commandant) in
Hamburg by the German police.
Wo would like to know why you
select isolated instances of mili
tarism to prove the existence of
an alleged wide-spread neo-Nazi
or ganization. Is this to be cited as
on example of the true German
mentality today?
WE WISH to recall the words of
Lt. Gen. Siegfried Westphal:
“We lost the war: now our only
battle is to win the affection and
respect of our- former foes. If all
the civilized nations can together
win the peace, then—the six mil
lion Germans who died on the bat
tlefields will not have sacrificed
their lives for their country in
vain."
If Germany is indeed to win this
respect her cause will not be help
ed by your contribution. The Ger
man problem must be studied in
proper historical context, guided
by the spirit of fairness and jus
tice.
