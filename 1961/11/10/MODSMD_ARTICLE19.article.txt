# Walter Lippmann On Nuclear Testing
## 
### 
The Soviet nuclear explosions,
which have been in the open air,
have posed the question of our re
sumption of testing in the open
air. The President’s statement of
Nov. 2 deals with this question
and, so it seems to me, defines it
accurately.

Since the Soviet Union has brok
en off I he negotiations for a treaty,
the United States must decide for
itself whether, when, how, and
how often it needs to conduct open
air tests in order to protect its
vital interests and its essential re
sponsibilities. These decisions
have to be made here in Washing
ton. They cannot be made by the
United Nations in New York be
cause the United Nations cannot
meet our paramount responsibili
ty should we become unable to
meet it.

Our paramount responsibility
is to maintain the nuclear force
needed to preserve without ques
tion the nuclear balance of power.
If we do that, co-existence will con
tinue to be practised and a world
war will continue to be highly im
probable. We can, therefore, never
take the chance of losing the race
of armaments, and the question of
testing must be decided by that
criterion.

THIS IS, as I understand, the po
sition taken by the President. He
will resume testing in the open air
if and as it is necessary to the
maintenance of our “relative po
sition.” He will not resume testing
in order' to make a big noise, or
propaganda or psychological war
fare. He will not, I take it, order
a test because some group of nu
clear scientists and weapons mak
ers have had a bright idea which
they would like to try out. If the
United States tests in the air, it
will be only because it deems the
tests essential to maintain the bal
ance of power.

This means that the decisions
will have to be made by the Presi
dent. that they cannot be made by
public debate. It is not only be
cause the President has the final
responsibility. It is also because
he is the only man with complete
access to all the knowable facts.

WHETHER, WHEN, and how to
test is not something that can be
decided by the Governor of New
York or by members of Congress
or by editors and columnists, or
by the man in the smoking car.
None of them knows enough.
None of them can know enough.

To tost or not to test will not be
one decision hut many. There will
be a long series of questions to be
decided specifically in the circum
stances. Only the President can
make these decisions because only
he can know the true condition of
our own armaments and of our
own technological capability. Also,
he knows what our best intelli
gence believes about affairs in the
Soviet Union.

In preparing for these decisions
the President should, it seems to
me. make a searching study of the
record of the advice given to Pres
ident Eisenhower and to Congress
and to the public during the past
few years. That record would
throw light on where among the
experts and civilian insiders he
should look now for advice.
THE RECORD since about 1955,
which is when the Soviet Union
tested successfully a hydrogen
bomb, is not a very happy one.
For in these years, when our po
sition has been that we would
rather have no nuclear treaty if it
was not perfect and foolproof, the
Soviet Union, which was way be
hind us in 1955, became a great nu
clear power.
To be sure, it is not nearly so
great a power as we are. The re
cent tests are an admission by the
Soviet Union that they are far be
hind us. But the Soviet Union is
already a sufficiently great nu

clear power to hold up its end in
the balance of terror-. It is strong
errough to have created a stale
mate in which we, who possess su
perior power, are still not able to
use nuclear power as an instru
ment of diplomacy.
The Soviet Union has been com
ing up from behind. In general, it
is almost certainly true that the
more tests there are by both nu
clear powers, the more the gap
which is now in our favor—will
tend to close.
THIS WILL BE a consideration
of the greatest importance as the
President makes his decisions.
There is no doubt that he must
test if and when it is clear to him
that our relative position is in
volved. But these occasions will be
comparatively rare. There are
likely to be many more times when
the issue is not clear, when it
would bo merely interesting and
convenient to test, when testing j
would help a hit this tactical pur
pose or that, although no clear
strategic purpose is involved.
At these times, when testing is
not necessary and compelling, the
other, countervailing, considera
tion will come into play. We will
not want unnecessarily to acceler
ate the equalizing effect of repeat
ed testing. For we are ahead and
they are coming up from behind.

responsibility. It is also because
he is the only man with complete
access to all the knowable facts.

WHETHER, WHEN, and how to
test is not something that can be
decided by the Governor of New
York or by members of Congress
or by editors and columnists, or
by the man in the smoking car.
None of them knows enough.
None of them can know enough.

To tost or not to test will not be
one decision hut many. There will
be a long series of questions to be
decided specifically in the circum
stances. Only the President can
make these decisions because only
he can know the true condition of
our own armaments and of our
own technological capability. Also,
he knows what our best intelli
gence believes about affairs in the
Soviet Union.

In preparing for these decisions
the President should, it seems to
me. make a searching study of the
record of the advice given to Pres
ident Eisenhower and to Congress
and to the public during the past
few years. That record would
throw light on where among the
experts and civilian insiders he
should look now for advice.
THE RECORD since about 1955,
which is when the Soviet Union
tested successfully a hydrogen
bomb, is not a very happy one.
For in these years, when our po
sition has been that we would
rather have no nuclear treaty if it
was not perfect and foolproof, the
Soviet Union, which was way be
hind us in 1955, became a great nu
clear power.
To be sure, it is not nearly so
great a power as we are. The re
cent tests are an admission by the
Soviet Union that they are far be
hind us. But the Soviet Union is
already a sufficiently great nu

clear power to hold up its end in
the balance of terror-. It is strong
errough to have created a stale
mate in which we, who possess su
perior power, are still not able to
use nuclear power as an instru
ment of diplomacy.
The Soviet Union has been com
ing up from behind. In general, it
is almost certainly true that the
more tests there are by both nu
clear powers, the more the gap
which is now in our favor—will
tend to close.
THIS WILL BE a consideration
of the greatest importance as the
President makes his decisions.
There is no doubt that he must
test if and when it is clear to him
that our relative position is in
volved. But these occasions will be
comparatively rare. There are
likely to be many more times when
the issue is not clear, when it
would bo merely interesting and
convenient to test, when testing j
would help a hit this tactical pur
pose or that, although no clear
strategic purpose is involved.
At these times, when testing is
not necessary and compelling, the
other, countervailing, considera
tion will come into play. We will
not want unnecessarily to acceler
ate the equalizing effect of repeat
ed testing. For we are ahead and
they are coming up from behind.

The Soviet nuclear explosions,
which have been in the open air,
have posed the question of our re
sumption of testing in the open
air. The President’s statement of
Nov. 2 deals with this question
and, so it seems to me, defines it
accurately.

Since the Soviet Union has brok
en off I he negotiations for a treaty,
the United States must decide for
itself whether, when, how, and
how often it needs to conduct open
air tests in order to protect its
vital interests and its essential re
sponsibilities. These decisions
have to be made here in Washing
ton. They cannot be made by the
United Nations in New York be
cause the United Nations cannot
meet our paramount responsibili
ty should we become unable to
meet it.

Our paramount responsibility
is to maintain the nuclear force
needed to preserve without ques
tion the nuclear balance of power.
If we do that, co-existence will con
tinue to be practised and a world
war will continue to be highly im
probable. We can, therefore, never
take the chance of losing the race
of armaments, and the question of
testing must be decided by that
criterion.

THIS IS, as I understand, the po
sition taken by the President. He
will resume testing in the open air
if and as it is necessary to the
maintenance of our “relative po
sition.” He will not resume testing
in order' to make a big noise, or
propaganda or psychological war
fare. He will not, I take it, order
a test because some group of nu
clear scientists and weapons mak
ers have had a bright idea which
they would like to try out. If the
United States tests in the air, it
will be only because it deems the
tests essential to maintain the bal
ance of power.

This means that the decisions
will have to be made by the Presi
dent. that they cannot be made by
public debate. It is not only be
cause the President has the final
responsibility. It is also because

The Soviet Union has been com

is almost certainly true that the
more tests there are by both nu

tend to close.
THIS WILL BE a consideration
of the greatest importance as the
President makes his decisions.
There is no doubt that he must
test if and when it is clear to him
that our relative position is in
volved. But these occasions will be
comparatively rare. There are
likely to be many more times when
the issue is not clear, when it
would bo merely interesting and
convenient to test, when testing j
would help a hit this tactical pur
pose or that, although no clear
strategic purpose is involved.
At these times, when testing is
not necessary and compelling, the
other, countervailing, considera

not want unnecessarily to acceler

ed testing. For we are ahead and
they are coming up from behind.

The Soviet nuclear explosions,
which have been in the open air,
have posed the question of our re
sumption of testing in the open
air. The President’s statement of
Nov. 2 deals with this question
and, so it seems to me, defines it
accurately.

Since the Soviet Union has brok
en off I he negotiations for a treaty,
the United States must decide for
itself whether, when, how, and
how often it needs to conduct open
air tests in order to protect its
vital interests and its essential re
sponsibilities. These decisions
have to be made here in Washing
ton. They cannot be made by the
United Nations in New York be
cause the United Nations cannot
meet our paramount responsibili
ty should we become unable to
meet it.

Our paramount responsibility
is to maintain the nuclear force
needed to preserve without ques
tion the nuclear balance of power.
If we do that, co-existence will con
tinue to be practised and a world
war will continue to be highly im
probable. We can, therefore, never
take the chance of losing the race
of armaments, and the question of
testing must be decided by that
criterion.

THIS IS, as I understand, the po
sition taken by the President. He
will resume testing in the open air
if and as it is necessary to the
maintenance of our “relative po
sition.” He will not resume testing
in order' to make a big noise, or
propaganda or psychological war
fare. He will not, I take it, order
a test because some group of nu
clear scientists and weapons mak
ers have had a bright idea which
they would like to try out. If the
United States tests in the air, it
will be only because it deems the
tests essential to maintain the bal
ance of power.

This means that the decisions
will have to be made by the Presi
dent. that they cannot be made by
public debate. It is not only be
cause the President has the final
responsibility. It is also because
he is the only man with complete
access to all the knowable facts.

WHETHER, WHEN, and how to
test is not something that can be
decided by the Governor of New
York or by members of Congress
or by editors and columnists, or
by the man in the smoking car.
None of them knows enough.
None of them can know enough.

To tost or not to test will not be
one decision hut many. There will
be a long series of questions to be
decided specifically in the circum
stances. Only the President can
make these decisions because only
he can know the true condition of
our own armaments and of our
own technological capability. Also,
he knows what our best intelli
gence believes about affairs in the
Soviet Union.

In preparing for these decisions
the President should, it seems to
me. make a searching study of the
record of the advice given to Pres
ident Eisenhower and to Congress
and to the public during the past
few years. That record would
throw light on where among the
experts and civilian insiders he
should look now for advice.
THE RECORD since about 1955,
which is when the Soviet Union
tested successfully a hydrogen
bomb, is not a very happy one.
For in these years, when our po
sition has been that we would
rather have no nuclear treaty if it
was not perfect and foolproof, the
Soviet Union, which was way be
hind us in 1955, became a great nu
clear power.
To be sure, it is not nearly so
great a power as we are. The re
cent tests are an admission by the
Soviet Union that they are far be
hind us. But the Soviet Union is
already a sufficiently great nu

clear power to hold up its end in
the balance of terror-. It is strong
errough to have created a stale
mate in which we, who possess su
perior power, are still not able to
use nuclear power as an instru
ment of diplomacy.
