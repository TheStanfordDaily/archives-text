HONOR CODE
Editor, The Daily:
There is one admirable feature
of the Stanford Honor Code which
many students unfortunately
overlook. That is that all students
are forced to be as honorable as
possible, or disastrous results will
immediately follow.
Just try to be dishonorable!
There is no opportunity. “Inter
pretations” of the supposedly
broad and personal Code are post
ed everywhere. One must “leave
all articles outside” of the book
store.
One cannot vote, take a book out
of the library, or write a letter to
The Daily without having one’s
signature checked for nefarious
forgery.
Who is clever enough for dis
honesty in these instances? In ex
amination rooms, students are
made to sit as far away from one
another as is practicable, and each
one writes his blue book under the
watchful eye of a potential inform
er. No one dares even look as
though he were cheating.
Thus we can easily see that the
Stanford Honor Code is a marvel
ous institution. For there is no al
ternative to honor. Of course, in
this atmosphere of fear and dis
trust, students never really quite
learn true honesty or integrity or
honor.
But this is indeed a trifling flaw,
for which we can surely forgive
the Administration.
