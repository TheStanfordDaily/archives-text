SLAIN DRAGON.
Editor, The Dally:
TO MONS. MALAPROP
O philosopher from afar,
0 searcher for Truth,
How skillfully you have
loosed your barbs
And slain the dragon Technology.
How foolish of man to aspire
to probe the vastness of space
Or to solve the mysteries
of forces within the nucleus.
How much superior is your
new way of thinking,
away of looking.
Backward.

HONOR CODE
Editor, The Daily:
1 definitely agree with Carl
Mitcham’s criticisms as regards
the Honor Code and his suggestion
that it merits thoughtful re-evalu

However, I think that there is a
further criticism well worth con
sideration. I feel that the very act
of signing all, or any part of the
Honor Code statement on an ex
amination is a hypocrisy.
I have never seen or heard of
any interpretation of the Honor
Code (or Fundamental Standard)
which suggests that the student
body not show respect for the per
sonal honor at all times (hat they
should abide by these concepts
only during an examination, if and
when they sign the Honor Code
statement.

ELECTIONS
Editor, The Daily:
How strange it is that a man
should be considered duly elected
by a Primary vote, especially
when he ran against no other
candidates and received not a ma
jority of the votes cast but merely
a plurality, more than the next
highest man.
Perhaps the 1,500-odd students
who cast their votes for other than
the winner-by-default would like
an opportunity to vote in a run-off
election.
Instead, a decision of a minority
(Election Commission) has been
put forth as the will of the majori
ty. It may be, but then, too, it may
