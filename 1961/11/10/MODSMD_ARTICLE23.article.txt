# Indians Return to the 'Troika'
## 
### 

COACH JACK CURTICE will return to his â€œtroika" system of rotating
three quarterbacks. The three field generals will be, left to right,
Chuck Butler, Jim Smith and Rod Sears. Curtice had been using three
men at this spot since the beginning of the season, but when sopho-

more Steve Thurlow was lost to illness he was forced to switch Smith
over from halfback. Jimmy, who has been throwing for only two
weeks now, will get the start. He completed four of eight last week
but had three intercepted.
