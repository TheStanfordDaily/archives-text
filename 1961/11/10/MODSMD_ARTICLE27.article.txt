## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The “Big Boot” is this Saturday,
and a tough bunch of Stanford
soccer players are determined to
end all chances of California’s get
ting a playoff berth to the NCAA
soccer championships by knock
ing off the Bears. The game will
be on the Stanford soccer field,
starting at 1:30 p.m.
If Stanford plays the way it did
against CCSF Wednesday then the
Bears had better look out.
Stanford lost the game 3-1, but
gave the San Franciscans the
roughest battle they have had this
year. Stanford soccer coach Fred
Priddle called the Stanford show
ing “a team effort all the way.”
Priddle said that Stanford had
the ball in CCSF territory 80 per
cent of the game, and took more
shots than the San Franciscans.
City College’s A1 Korbus scored

all three of his team’s goals but
Stanford back Don Burr did a
good job. holding him to below
his scoring average.
Ed Clarke scored for Stanford
on a tip of a perfect crossfield pass
from Larry Chukwudbe.
Priddle singled out goalie Hunt
Bascom and halfback Rusty Wil
liams. Bascom played will defens
ively, despite playing with a
broken toe, a charleyhorse, and a
badly cut and bruised face. Wil
liams did his usual outstanding
work in the defensive backfield.
The starting lineup against Cal
should be Bascom in the goal; Ed
gar Berner and cither Rich Loner -
gan or Sandy Pofahl at fullbacks;
Don Burr, Williams and Mike Ero
at halfbacks; and a front lino of
Roberto Santa Cruz, Chukwudbe,
Emmanuel Andah. Albert Nnoli,
and either Mike Tippett or Clarke.
