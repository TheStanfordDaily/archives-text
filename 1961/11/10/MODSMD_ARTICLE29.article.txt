## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Daily reporter Art Robinson
will accompany the team to Los
Angeles (o cover the Stanford
USC game. His account will ap
pear in Monday’s Daily.

USC’s Trojans will be after a
share of the AAWU grid leader
ship, and Stanford’s Indians will
he out to get back on the win side
of the ledger when the two teams
tangle in Los Angeles Memorial
Colosseum tomorrow.
The Trojans currently are in
second place in the Big Five, and
a Trojan win would place them in
a tie with UCLA’s Bruins who face
a non-league encounter tonight.
Stanford, fighting to get out of
a three-game losing streak, will be
trying extra hard to win against
the Trojans. The Indians always
play at their best against El Troje

in the spacious Colosseum, and
with several Southland squad
members would like nothing bet
ter than to carry a victory back to
the Farm.
Going into tomorrow’s clash, the
Tribe will be a O'ii-point underdog,
according to the odds makers. But
odds mean very little when the
Cards and Trojans meet, where a
Stanford victory comes second
only to a win in the Big Game
against Cal.
However, Stanford, described by
the coaches as the “walking
wounded,” will be handicapped by
an overflow of injuries.
Gary Sargent, the Card’s top
defensive back will not make the
trip to the Southland because of a
sprained ankle. His position will
be taken up by junior Tim Hansel.
Fullbacks Jay Ward and Tony
DeLellls will accompany the team
but probably won’t see much ac
tion.
George Honore pulled a ham
string muscle in practice Wednes
day, but he is expected to be ready
for the game tomorrow. Stan
Lindskog, the Tribe’s busiest half
back, sprained an ankle last Tues
day. and doctors report that he
will he available only for kicking
duty.
Halfbacks Gary Cr aig and Mike
Barnes will share Lindskog’s post,
while Bob Pr ice will be moved up
to wingback on defense.
The Trojanmen are not without
injuries of their own, although
perhaps not to the same extent as
Stanford. First on the list is
speedy Willy Brown,
Earlier in the week it was re
ported by Trojan coach Johnny
McKay that Brown definitely
would not be available for fluty.
But the Indians will believe it
when they see it lor when they
don’t see it).
Other ailing Troymen are
guards Bert Williams and Chuck
Anderson, and centers Skip John
son and Dave Morgan.
Except for the injuries, the In
dians should open with pretty
much the same line-up as started
last week against Oregon, with
Jim Smith the probable starter at
the signal calling position.


USC’S PETE BEATHARD will open at quarterback when the Trojans
host the Indians this weekend. Beathard, a sophomore, has com
pleted 38 of 71 passes for 467 yards and has averaged over four
yards per carry on the ground.
