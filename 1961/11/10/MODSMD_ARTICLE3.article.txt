# LASSU Dings Flick Price Hike for WUS
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Editor 
In a rapid 50-minute session,
Legislature last night refused a
World University Service request
to tack 20 cents on to the Nov.
26 Flick price—the extra 20 cents
to go to the WUS drive.
WUS Chairman Randy Sugar
man told LASSU that the drive
could net about $3OO by doubling
the regular 20-cent admission
charge.
HE SAID personal soliciting at
the movie would be impractical,
and pointed out that Legislature
last year approved such a move
for the Winter Drive and the Con
Homo Drive.
However, the LASSU Appropri
ations Committee went on record
against the proposal. Its report
declared “such an addition to the
Flick price would be in the na
ture of coercion” and “not In
keeping with the spirit of the
Flicks.”
It added that it supported the
WUS drive but could not back
the Flick price hike.
STUDENT Financial Manager
Bud Ratts said a 20-cent increase
in the regular price would not be
“in the spirit of giving” and “I
don’t think we should force (the
students) to contribute” to the
drive.”

In other action, LASSU okayed
a huge Big Game morning pan
cake breakfast to be put on in
front of the bookstore as a fund
raising effort by the Stanford
crew, which draws 95 per cent of
its funds from voluntary contri
butions.

LASSU also approved Dick
Tesehner, jr., as chairman of the
Political Union Republican Cau
cus.
