## Giants, Packers Picked to Win 
### 
(UPFi The New York Giants I
are a surprising three-point choice j
over the Philadelphia Eagles i
while the Green Bay Packers are j
favored by the same margin over 1
the Chicago Bears for Sunday’s |
two divisional showdowns in the j
National Football League.
Oddsmakers leaned toward the j
Giants because of three factors: a
rugged defense rated tops in the
NFL; the Eagles’ loss of star de-!
fensive back Tom Brookshier, and |
the fact the game will be played in
New York before a sellout crowd
of 65,000, largely Giants partisans.
A GIANTS victory would throw
the Eastern Division race into a
tie between these two teams.
And an upset victory by the {
Bears over the Packers at Chicago
would make a five-club scramble i
of the Western Division. Should
the Packers go down to their third j
defeat of the year, this would put
Chicago, San Francisco, Detroit
and even possibly Baltimore back j
into the running for the title.
The “line” on Sunday’s other
NFL games favored the San Fran
cisco Forty Niners by 4 points over
the Rams at Los Angeles; the!
Pittsburgh Steelers by 10 at home
over the Dallas Cowboys; the De
troit Lions by 2 over the Cardinals
at St. Louis; the Cleveland Browns
by 12 over the Redskins at Wash
ington, and the Baltimore Colts j
by 14 over the Vikings at Minne
sota.
IN THE American Football
League, the undefeated San Diego
Chargers were picked by 20 points
to heat the Broncos at Denver and
clinch the Western Division j
crown.
