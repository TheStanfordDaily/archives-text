cross country team travels south
this weekend fora triangular meet
with the two Los Angeles powers,
USC and UCLA, Saturday.
The Indian traveling squad of
•seven includes five freshmen.
Weym Kirkland is the team’s top
man and has come up with the
finest times of any freshman in
the history of Stanford. Other
frosh making the trip will be Har
lan Andrews, John Beck, Paul
Schlicke, and Dave Stineheck.
Senior Rich Klier and sophomore
Bill Pratt round out the team.

injuries which slowed him down
earlier in the season.
In SC and UCLA the Indians
will be meeting a couple of teams

i they have already defeated this
I year. Coach Payton Jordan ex
| pects both to be improved over
that performance.
Two of the finest cross-country
runners on the coast, Milt Dahl of
UCLA and Julio Marin of USC will
battle for first place. “We’ll be
shooting for team points and not
worrying about having any one
man win the race,” Jordan said.
He rates UCLA a shade strong
j er than USC. but feels his Indians
should repeat as winner over both.
This year’s Card team has run
the third fastest limes ever on the
j Stanford course. They have been
defeated by San Jose State twice
and Cal once. “We’ve improved a
great deal and I think we’ll be up
i for this one,” Jordan said.
