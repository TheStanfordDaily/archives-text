# Avant-Garde 'Mr, Mississippi' Busy, Weak

By Bridget Ilursley Dobson
Seeing the Stanford Players’
production of “The Marriage of
Mr. Mississippi” by Friedrich
Duerrenmatt is an interesting ex
perience. though not an enlighten
ing one. “Truth is always mad
ness,” says one of the characters,
speaking for Duerrenmatt. I don't
know about “Truth,” but there is
complete madness in the produc
tion.
The play is essentially a potpour
ri of ridicule on the usual subjects
—theater, religion, politics, moral
ity, love, marriage, hypocrisy,
idealism, aristocracy, justice, and
■so on. Somehow the flavor and
meaning is lost in the muddle.
HAD IT NOT been for the avant
garde slapstick, the whole evening
would have been a waste of time.
I was intrigued by strange doc
tors, revolutionaries, gunmen, and
other characters who would sud
denly appear for 1 no apparent rea
son. They would dance across the
stage or come running down the
aisles through the audience, and
then disappear as mysteriously as I
they had come.
The production, under the di- \
rection of Juris Svendsen, utilized 1
the theater in an unusual way.
There is no illusion of reality. The
stage tilts, the lights and set props
are exposed, and often the actors
speak directly to the audience.
Undoubtedly the best aspect of
the whole mad show is the use of
film, directed by Raoul Piezer.
The vignettes on the screen are de
lightfully amusing, and they serve
to fill in some of the gaps i hut not
enough of them i in coherency.

THU ACTING is, for the most
part, not distinguished. But, with
the constant physical interrup
tions (a paper airplane flying
across the stage, among other
things) it is almost impossible for
an actor to establish any sort of
rapport with the audience. The ac
tors are upstaged by. and could not
compete with, the spectacular
physical production.
As Vanessa, the beautiful seduc
tress with four men in love with
her, Barbara Greer is. in isolated
moments, very convincing. She
lies about her adultery with appro
priate calculated coldness. But too
much of her acting declines to
recitation of lines combined with
facial grimaces, and in that way
she loses some of the potential
emotional impact in the lines. Her
performance does not live up to
l her ability. In lonesco’s play “Vic
j Urns of Duty,” produced by the
; Stanford Players last summer, she
’ revealed her talent for acting.
Phil Ellis as the Minister of Jus
tice gives a fine performance. He
I portrays a state official whose
j only connection with justice is his
official title. He is properly evil,
| beneath his righteous official
j manners.
liUKK VANIA is excellent in the
j role of Count Übelche. He plays a
pathetic, drunken man in search
| of Truth. Vania succeeds in com
| bining humor and pathos a dif-
I ficult task for any' actor.
In the role of the communist, St.
Claude, Victor Emeljanow demon
strates his versatility as an actor,
i He switches from genial host to
I f.utalit revolutionary with ease

and competence.
John Kulsar as Mr. Mississippi
gives an adequate performance.
However his portrayal of the re
fined widower-prosecutor is click
ed. He lacks the depth and intensi
ty of a public prosecutor who is
also a murderer.
The set by Richard Hay is excel
lent. It is complex and effective.
Costumes by Douglas Russell are
appropriate.

The play continues tonight and
tomorrow night only. Tickets are
on sale at Memorial box office.
Prices are $2.50, $2, $1.50 and
$1.25 for the general public. Stan
ford students may get a 50-cent
discount on all tickets by present
ing a student body card.


AS MR. MISSISSIPPI (John Kular) dies of poisoning, his wife Vanessa
(Barbara Greer) smiles inscrutably.
