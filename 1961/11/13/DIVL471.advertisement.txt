IT’S LATER THAN YOU THINK!
All year long you’ve been promising yourself to go there. Now
the semester is nearly over and you still haven’t sot foot in the
place. Shame on you!
But it’s not too late. Right now, this very minute, before
you weaken, lift up your head and forward march to the place
you have been avoiding ever since school began. I refer, of
course, to the library.
Now here you are at the library. That wasn’t so bad, was
it? Of course not! (Jo inside. What do you see? A sign that says
“NO SMOKING.” Go outside. Light a Marlboro. Smoke.
Go back inside.
Because now you afercacty. Now your trembling resolution
is rigid. Now your pulsing psyche is serene. You have been
calmed by mild Marlboro. You have been soothed by that fine
selectrate filter, by that fine full flavor that dotes and pampers
and caresses, that lifts the fallen, repairs the shattered, straight
ens the bent, unravels the knotted, rights the askew, and
fastens the unbuttoned.
In the center of the library you see the main circulation desk.
Ixx»k in the card catalogue for the number of the book you
want, write the number on a slip, and hand it to the efficient
and obliging young lady at the desk. The efficient and obliging
young lady then gives the slip to an efficient and obliging page
boy who trots briskly back into the stacks, curls up on a limp
leather encyclopedia, and sleeps for an hour or two. Then,
puffy hut refreshed, he returns your slip to the efficient and
obliging young lady at the desk, who tells you one of three
things: a) “Your book is out. ’ b) “Your book is at the bindery.”
c) “Your book is on reserve.”
Having learned that the circulation desk hasn’t the least
intention of ever parting with a book, let us now go into the
periodical room. Here we spend hours sifting through an im
posing array of magazines—magazines from all the far corners
of the earth, magazines of every nature and description—but
though we search diligently and well, we cannot find Mad or
Playboy.
Next let us venture into the reference room. Here in this
hushed, vaulted chamber, we find the true scholars of the
university—earnest, dedicated young men and women who care
for only one thing in the world: the pursuit of knowledge.
Let us eavesdrop for a moment on this erudite couple poring
over heavy tomes at the corner table. Hush! She speaks:
SHE: Whatcha readin’, hey?
HE: The Origin of Species. You ever read it?
SHE: No, but I seen the movie.
HE: Oh.
SHE: You like readin’?
HE: Naah.
SHE: What do you like?
HE: Hockey, licorice, girls, stuff like that.
SHE: Me too, hey.
HE: You pinned or anything?
SHE: Well, sort of. I'm wearin a fellow’s motorcycle
emblem ... But it’s only platonic.
HE: Wanna go out for a smoke?
SHE: Marlboro?
HE; What else?
And as our learned friends take their leave, let us too wend
our way homeward—a trifle weary, perhaps, but enlightened
and renewed and better citizens for having spent these happy
hours in the library, Aloha, library, aloha!
