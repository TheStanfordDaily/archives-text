“THE SMOKING LAMP IS LIT!” For Sailors and Marines, that means happy
time. They can slow down and light up a Lucky. In the Army and Air Force, the
cry is “Take ten!”—Lucky lighting time again. But Lucky you; you can enjoy
Luckies any time. Why, you can even have one right now. And won’t it taste
great! Full, rich tobacco flavor—that's why college students smoke more
Luckies than any other regular. March out and buy a pack.
