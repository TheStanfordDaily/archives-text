# Nehru Blasts Russ Nuclear Explosions

NEW YORK (UP!) Indian
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru
took a rare, self-critical look at
the neutralist bloc yesterday and
conceded it was not showing suf
ficient “indignation” aaginst So
viet nuclear tests and Russian
domination of eastern Europe.
Nehru, in an unusually frank
interview recorded here before his
departure for Los Angeles, ac
knowledged that communism’s
Iron Curtain rule “sometimes . . .
is even worse” than the old-style
Western colonialism on which neu
tralists seem to focus most of their
attention.
HK ALSO said self-determina
tion for East Europe would be a
“good thing” and called Russia’s
resumption of nuclear testing
“completely wrong.” If the other
Afro-Asian nations failed to use
such unequivocal language, he
said, “You can only explain that
by past conditioning of all these
countries” under former Western
control.
In Washington, U.S. Ambassa
dor to India John Kenneth Gal
braith, in a TV interview said he
believed the recent meeting be
tween Nehru and President Ken
nedy had led to a greater under
standing by Nehru of the U.S. po
sition on Viet Nam, Berlin and nu
clear testing.
The author and former Harvard
economies professor added that he
felt the major purpose of the talks
between the two world leaders, to
permit them to learn each other’s
views, had been “brilliantly ac
complished.”
GALBRAITH SAID he hoped
because of the talks Nehru would
play a greater role in saving South
Viet Nam from Communism.
The 71-year-old neutralist leader
appeared as guest of U.N. Ambas
sador Adlai E. Stevenson on the
ABC radio TV program “Adlai
Stevenson Reports.”
His critical reappraisal of re
cent neutralist stands in the cold
war was prompted by Stevenson's
statement that some non-aligned
nations seemed to be showing pro-
Russian prejudice.
This was part of the exchage:
Stevenson: “There is one thing I
have not been able to understand
of late. Here we have seen refu
gees shot in cold blood in Berlin.
We have seen double-dealing of
the Soviet Union in respect to nu
clear testing , . . and yet I do not
see this stirs up the kind of indig
nation among the non-aligned peo
ple that one would expect ...”
NEHRU: “You are right, gover
nor. to some extent. I think we
will find almost everyone deplor

ing this, but you are right that the
degree of indignation may bo less
er than elsewhere ...”
Nehru said the apparent lack of
enthusiasm among African na
tions for a firm stand against var
ious Russian misdeeds was due in
part to the fact they are “full of
their own problems” that come
with independence.
“The rest of the world does not
seem to exist for them except
vaguely as an imperialist colonial
world against which they are
striving to free themselves,” he
said: “You see, on their back
ground which they have grown in
to, they react accordingly.”
