# Crowds Flock To Hear Talk By Clergyman

### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
Canon Bryan Green, with his
delightfully candid and forthright
manner, drew large crowds to
both his morning and evening
services at Memorial Church yes
terday.
Speaking directly to a student
audience, he emphasized that be
coming a Christian is a process,
conversion is never sudden.
“THERE ARE some students
at Stanford who cannot at this
moment become Christians. It is
not the spiritual moment. For
others, however, this is the mo
ment when God is passing by.
He urged, “Don’t despise your
doubts, they are part of the proc
ess. Remember that God calls you
as you are, including your doubts.
“BECOMING a Christian is a
selfish act,” Canon Green stated.
“The idea that you love God be
cause Jove is so lovable is .just
nonsense. You come to Christ be
cause you need him. And he ac
cepts you as you are.”
He continued, “The Christian
Church is guilty of a great sin
the sin of trying to mold people
into a conventional attitude. This
is false to the New Testament.
“Christ wanted people as they
are to use them as they are.”
Quoting the passage from the
New Testament w here Christ
says to Peter, “Follow me and I
will make you to become a fisher
of men,” the Anglican clergymen
said. “There are plenty of ways
of fishing for men there are dif
ferent kinds of bait, different
kinds of tackle, and different
methods. If your religion is mak
ing you unnatural, there is some
thing wrong, for Christ wants
you to be a natural and happy
person.
“HOWEVER,” Canon Green
hastened to point out, “becoming
a Christian does not give you
peace of mind, for if you know
Christ, you will seek to make him
known."
To illustrate this point, Green
told of a friend of his who some
years ago “proudly announced to
me that she had found perfect
peace of mind. She said she had
found it through psychology.
“I said to her, ‘delighted to
hear it, absolutely delighted to
hear that you have found perfect
peace of mind, but you know if
you were a real Christian you
wouldn’t have that peace of mind.
You would want to be shooting
out in all directions doing
things.’ ”
