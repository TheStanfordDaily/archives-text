# Let's Look Again At Charity Drives
## 
### 
Legislature made a wise decision last Thursday when it refused
to double the Sunday Flick price for Nov. 26, with the extra 20 cents
going to the World University Service drive.
Obviously, the decision was not taken because LASSU doesn't
support the WUS drive. The WUS drive is a very worthy effort,
and deserves the support of the student body.
As was pointed out, however, the hiking of the 20-cent Flick
price to 40 cents is coercion, pure and simple. Such a move is taken
because it is a quick, easy and painless way to get money from an
apathetic student body. This was done twice last year, once for
Winter Drive and once for the Con Home Drive.

It is done witli the knowledge that few, if any, students will com
plain about the increased admission charge because even at 40 cents
they are saving 85 cents over the., regular movie admission. Yet
forcing students to give money to a drive is hardly in the spirit of
giving—although it is a very practical way of raising money at Stan
ford.

What concerns us more than this isolated instance is the entire
atmosphere which surrounds the annual WUS and Winter Drives—
and whether they should be continued. Mass apathy greets these
two drives each year despite the wide publicity they receive. Frank
ly, no one cares about the two drives except the people running
them and a few scattered individuals.

This is ironic, for the two drives support extremely worthy
causes. WUS, for instance, gives aid to needy college students the
world over. One thus would assume Stanford—or any university—
would back the WUS drive wholeheartedly. Other schools do, but
Stanford couldn’t care less about the drive or its causes. The same
goes for Winter Drive put on by Cardinals which benefits such or
ganizations as the Heart Association and a fund to send worthy
Negroes to college. This lack of interest is not an assumption; it
is a fact observable to anyone who has ever worked in one of these
drives or tried to drum up interest in them.
One also can question the methods of collection, which include
everything but sponsoring parachute jumps from the top of Hoover
Tower in their bid to raise money. In many living groups, for in
stance, donations come not from individuals hut as a lump sum
from the group. The feeling of individual giving to a worthwhile
cause is completely lost here.

And in both drives, not much money is raised. About $2,000 is
brought iu by the Winter Drive, and last year’s WUS collection
slipped to $l,lOO from the previous year’s $2,200.
Certainly, thorough examination as to whether the two drives
should continue is in order. We feel that as long as the present
Stanford attitude of apathy and occasional outright hostility to the
two drives continues—despite the best efforts of those running them
—the drives will not he successful.

Until a change in attitude on the part of the students so that
they give voluntarily and generously is brought about, it seems to
us that the efforts of those involved in the WUS and Winter Drives
could be better spent elsewhere.

could be better spent elsewhere.
Legislature made a wise decision last Thursday when it refused
to double the Sunday Flick price for Nov. 26, with the extra 20 cents
going to the World University Service drive.
Obviously, the decision was not taken because LASSU doesn't
support the WUS drive. The WUS drive is a very worthy effort,
and deserves the support of the student body.
As was pointed out, however, the hiking of the 20-cent Flick
price to 40 cents is coercion, pure and simple. Such a move is taken
because it is a quick, easy and painless way to get money from an
apathetic student body. This was done twice last year, once for
Winter Drive and once for the Con Home Drive.

It is done witli the knowledge that few, if any, students will com
plain about the increased admission charge because even at 40 cents
they are saving 85 cents over the., regular movie admission. Yet
forcing students to give money to a drive is hardly in the spirit of
giving—although it is a very practical way of raising money at Stan
ford.

What concerns us more than this isolated instance is the entire
atmosphere which surrounds the annual WUS and Winter Drives—
and whether they should be continued. Mass apathy greets these
two drives each year despite the wide publicity they receive. Frank
ly, no one cares about the two drives except the people running
them and a few scattered individuals.

This is ironic, for the two drives support extremely worthy
causes. WUS, for instance, gives aid to needy college students the
world over. One thus would assume Stanford—or any university—
would back the WUS drive wholeheartedly. Other schools do, but
Stanford couldn’t care less about the drive or its causes. The same
goes for Winter Drive put on by Cardinals which benefits such or
ganizations as the Heart Association and a fund to send worthy
Negroes to college. This lack of interest is not an assumption; it
is a fact observable to anyone who has ever worked in one of these
drives or tried to drum up interest in them.
One also can question the methods of collection, which include
everything but sponsoring parachute jumps from the top of Hoover
Tower in their bid to raise money. In many living groups, for in
stance, donations come not from individuals hut as a lump sum
from the group. The feeling of individual giving to a worthwhile
cause is completely lost here.

And in both drives, not much money is raised. About $2,000 is
brought iu by the Winter Drive, and last year’s WUS collection
slipped to $l,lOO from the previous year’s $2,200.
Certainly, thorough examination as to whether the two drives
should continue is in order. We feel that as long as the present
Stanford attitude of apathy and occasional outright hostility to the
two drives continues—despite the best efforts of those running them
—the drives will not he successful.

Until a change in attitude on the part of the students so that
they give voluntarily and generously is brought about, it seems to
us that the efforts of those involved in the WUS and Winter Drives
could be better spent elsewhere.
