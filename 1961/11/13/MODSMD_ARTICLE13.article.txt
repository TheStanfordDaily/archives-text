# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Three Men on Island' Is a 'Pure Joy to See' 
### KERRY FELTHAM 
“Three Men on an Island” (at
the Paris in Palo Alto) is an
abstract, Renaissance piece of
film art—and pure joy to see.
ABSTRACT because it is semi
representational animated film,
Renaissance not because it is neo
classic in style (it is anything but)
but because it is eclectic, expan
sive, exciting in its implications.
It is a joy because it has fire,
imagination, wit, subtlety and
technical mastery of the plasticity
of film. It is a film to be conjured
with.
Basically, it concerns three little
men on an island. Each man has
hut one idea. The first, love, the
second beauty, the third, truth.
Love, in the beginning Christliko,
becomes powerful and nasty.
Beauty becomes petulant. Truth
develops a bomb. None under
stands either of the other two. It
might be called a fable, or an alle
gory, but a most deftly handled
fable.
PERHAPS THE most endear
ing feature of this short is the
grace and wit abounding in the
treatment, for the subject is dan
gerously susceptible to heavy
handed allegorizing.
As film, “Three Mon” enjoys
the mastery of technique and
imaginative use of the film medi
um 1 o create art which is literally
breath-taking. It forces the reali
zation that art is untranslatable
into another medium stunningly.
How could light, color, changing
shapes and nuances—motion of
form—possibly be written or play
ed or painted?
The sound track, too, is devilish
cunning. It is also, as they say in
North Beach, Wild. Wordless, it
backs up Klee-like arrows with
“William Tell,” and enhances

quavery, tentative smiles of the
three silly beggars with the sound
of quavery, tentative driplets of
water falling, glip! Humbug. It
cannot be described.
Cunning, left, its subject im
mensely important, this film de
serves far more than eulogizing.
GO SEE IT.

The second film, “Odd Obses
sion,” doesn’t deserve to be seen
as a film. As a tale of sexual per
versity in a middle-aged Japanese
man, it is a Cannes Film Festival
winner. It is more successful as a
novel.
There is little point in describ
ing the film production. It is a
play filmed by a rather unimagin
ative camera. The musical score
is ordinary. About the oddest fea
ture of the film is its palish color.
BUT AS A story, it is fascinat
ing. Originally a novel titled “The
Key,” it concerns a sixty-ish Jap
anese professor concerned with
his lack of ardor for his wife. He
thus encourages his daughter’s
fiancee to seduce his wife in order
to use his jealousy as an aphrodisi
ac for himself.
Then he begins taking pictures
of his wife, naked and soporific
from strong drink, and having his
daughter’s suitor develop them.
Presumably, no upstanding photo
’ab would touch them. Son-in-law
to-be takes to the idea with alac
rity. and (to the distress of the old
man) the situation swiftly gets
beyond the latter’s control.
SUFFERING from a surfeit of
self-induced aphrodesia, the old
man develops high blood pressure
and succumbs. The denouement is
swift, and pretty interesting. The
novel did it better.
In fine, a recommendation: All
occidentals like a look.

In fine, a recommendation: All
occidentals like a look.
“Three Men on an Island” (at
the Paris in Palo Alto) is an
abstract, Renaissance piece of
film art—and pure joy to see.
ABSTRACT because it is semi
representational animated film,
Renaissance not because it is neo
classic in style (it is anything but)
but because it is eclectic, expan
sive, exciting in its implications.
It is a joy because it has fire,
imagination, wit, subtlety and
technical mastery of the plasticity
of film. It is a film to be conjured
with.
Basically, it concerns three little
men on an island. Each man has
hut one idea. The first, love, the
second beauty, the third, truth.
Love, in the beginning Christliko,
becomes powerful and nasty.
Beauty becomes petulant. Truth
develops a bomb. None under
stands either of the other two. It
might be called a fable, or an alle
gory, but a most deftly handled
fable.
PERHAPS THE most endear
ing feature of this short is the
grace and wit abounding in the
treatment, for the subject is dan
gerously susceptible to heavy
handed allegorizing.
As film, “Three Mon” enjoys
the mastery of technique and
imaginative use of the film medi
um 1 o create art which is literally
breath-taking. It forces the reali
zation that art is untranslatable
into another medium stunningly.
How could light, color, changing
shapes and nuances—motion of
form—possibly be written or play
ed or painted?
The sound track, too, is devilish
cunning. It is also, as they say in
North Beach, Wild. Wordless, it
backs up Klee-like arrows with
“William Tell,” and enhances

quavery, tentative smiles of the
three silly beggars with the sound
of quavery, tentative driplets of
water falling, glip! Humbug. It
cannot be described.
Cunning, left, its subject im
mensely important, this film de
serves far more than eulogizing.
GO SEE IT.

The second film, “Odd Obses
sion,” doesn’t deserve to be seen
as a film. As a tale of sexual per
versity in a middle-aged Japanese
man, it is a Cannes Film Festival
winner. It is more successful as a
novel.
There is little point in describ
ing the film production. It is a
play filmed by a rather unimagin
ative camera. The musical score
is ordinary. About the oddest fea
ture of the film is its palish color.
BUT AS A story, it is fascinat
ing. Originally a novel titled “The
Key,” it concerns a sixty-ish Jap
anese professor concerned with
his lack of ardor for his wife. He
thus encourages his daughter’s
fiancee to seduce his wife in order
to use his jealousy as an aphrodisi
ac for himself.
Then he begins taking pictures
of his wife, naked and soporific
from strong drink, and having his
daughter’s suitor develop them.
Presumably, no upstanding photo
’ab would touch them. Son-in-law
to-be takes to the idea with alac
rity. and (to the distress of the old
man) the situation swiftly gets
beyond the latter’s control.
SUFFERING from a surfeit of
self-induced aphrodesia, the old
man develops high blood pressure
and succumbs. The denouement is
swift, and pretty interesting. The
novel did it better.
