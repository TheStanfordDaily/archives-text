# Molotov Back In Moscow-Fate Unknown
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPD—-V. M. Molo
tov, former Soviet premier and
foreign minister, came home in
disgrace yesterday from semi-offi
cial foreign exile to face probable
ouster from the Communist party
he joined 55 years ago.
Molotov virtually stole into this
cold wintry capital where he was
expected to answer accusations
that he led a 1957 Kremlin coup
that nearly overthrew Premier Ni
kita Khrushchev's government.
The old Bolshevik who was once
the righthand man of Stalin re
turned by train from Vienna
where he held the minor post of
Soviet representative to the Inter
national Atomic Energy Author
ity.
MOLOTOV, accompanied by his
wife, was met at the station only
by his daughter and two relatives
who rushed him off to their home.
Three men wearing turned down
green snap-brim hats—the usual
garb of Soviet security police-fell
into step behind Molotov as he
walked along the station platform.
They kept their distance and said
nothing.
“Why did you come to Mos
cow?” newsmen asked Molotov.
“I came home,” he answered
simply.
Asked about his apparent expul
sion from his Vienna post and his
position in the Communist party,
Molotov said:
“YOU know everything. You
don’t have to ask me. Let’s change
the subject. Let’s speak of some
thing else.”
While Molotov was still in Vien
na he came under violent attack
by Khrushchev and other speakers
at the recent 22nd Congress of the
Soviet Communist Party. Khrush
chev accused him of criminal com
plicity in Stalin’s mass crimes in
addition to being a leader of the
so-called “anti-party” group that
tried to upset the government four
years ago.
Khrushchev himself was not on
hand for Molotov’s home-coming.
The premier was on a tour of So
viet Central Asia inspecting farm
areas.
MOLOTOV’S future was un
known. Khrushchev has virtually
promised that he is safe from the
execution that probably would
have been his lot for similar
“crimes” under Stalin.
Most observers predicted he
would live out his days in domestic
exile and exclusion from the Com
munist party.
