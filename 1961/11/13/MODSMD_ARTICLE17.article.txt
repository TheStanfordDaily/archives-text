## The 						Common Market 
### 
When Great Britain decided to
apply for full membership in the
European Economic Community,
known as the Common Market,
she set in motion a chain of events
which will involve deeply the
whole non-Communist world.

In the coming months, during
the next session of Congress, we
shall have to re-examine our econ
omic foreign policy. Assuming al
ways that there is no war, the is
sue will be how far and In what
way we should work with what
will then be the greatest trading
community on earth.
The original Common Market,
which was founded in 1957, con
sisted of six Western European
nations: France, West Germany,
Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium
and Luxembourg.

THEY HAVE prospered great
ly, and last summer Great Brit
tain decided to apply for full
membership on the understanding
that the vital interests of the
Commonwealth countries could
in one way and another be safe
guarded. Great Britain has now
been followed by Denmark, Ire
land and Norway, and most re
cently by the three classic Euro
pean neutrals, Switzerland, Swe
den and Austria.

The neutrals have agreed to ap
ply jointly lor associate member
ship. An associate member, pre
sumably, would participate in the
internal free trade within the
Common Market; it would, how
ever, keep away from the politi
cal association which looks, as yet
quite vaguely, towards some kind
of confederation.

Before long, there will come to
be a working arrangement em
bracing all the nineteen European
countries which belonged to the
first European organization lor
economic cooperation, the OEEC.

THE S E DEVELOPMENTS,
which stem originally from the
Marshall Plan, have always had
the warm approval of the Ameri
can government. We have worked
for a strong, prosperous, and
united European community
which would be a mainstay of
Western civilization. Now, if the
British negotiations in regard to
the interests of the Common
wealth are successful, there will
exist what since 1948 we have
always wanted to see.
Then we shall find that we have
to live with and trade with and
negotiate with an economic and
indeed political bloc which will in
a few years have a common tariff
against all the rest of the world
and free trade internally among
its members. It is bound to be
come also a great political power
in the world, and necessarily, in
deed by deliberate purpose, it will
have many of the attributes of
a new great world power.
This new community will have
within it 300 million people. It
will not only be the largest trad
ing unit in the world but its econ
omic and financial power will be
virtually equal to ours. As Mr.
Ball, the Under Secretary of State
for Economic Affairs, has pul it,
“the positions of relative econ
omic strength in the free world
have radically changed.”

AS A RESULT of the extraor
dinary rise in the productivity of
Western Europe, “the postwar de
pendence of Europe upon the
United State economic foreign
policy has now become an inter
dependence between Europe and
the United States.”

The economic and financial pre
eminence of the United States or
iginated in the First World War.
It grew even greater during the
Second World War when almost
all of Europe was occupied and
prostrated.
But the solitary American pre
eminence in the non-Communist
world was not a normal and
healthy thing. It was the reflec
tion of the sickness of Europe.
Morally and politically the de
pendence of Europe upon the
United States was unhealthy for
them and unhealthy for us. Now
Western Europe has recovered,
and we may be glad that we start
ed the recovery by proposing the
Marshall Plan.
WE MAY BE glad also that
Western Europe has responded,
largely under the guiding genius
of Mr. Jean Monnet, by institut
ing cooperative measures such as
OEEC, the European Payments
Union, the Coal and Steel Com
munity, Euratom and finally the
Common Market.
We are now long past the time

when wo need to worry about the
economic health of Europe. In
deed, we must begin to think
about devising ways in which we
and the Europeans can use our
resources to accomplish better
the tasks we have jointly in the
world.

In recent years, the economic
growth of the nations of the Com
mon Market has been faster than
that of the United States. Brit
ain’s growth has been slower. But
her coming participation in a
larger and less sheltered market
will provide the discipline of
wider competition and the stimu
lus of Europe’s economic boom.
In Prime Minister Macmillan’s
words, Britain will bo entering a
“bracing cold shower, not a re
laxing Turkish bath.”

SPURRED BY THE enormous
economic expansion of the Com
mon Market, trade has prospered
not only within the Common Mar
ket countries but between them
and the rest of the world. The so
called “trade-diverting” effects of
the new tariff arrangements have
proved to be negligible.

Although the growth of trade
among the nations of the Com
mon Market has been greater
than the growth of imports from
outside their bloc, the entire
world has benefited from the
economic growth of Western Eu
rope. Thus, for example, the
United States sales to the Com
mon Market area were 44 per cent
higher in 1960 than they were in
1959, and 36 per cent higher than
they were in 1958.
So far, then, the growth of a
major free trade stake in the
prosperity and unity of the West
ern society. But we cannot as
sume that this will continue un

less we make a careful adaptation
of our trade policies to this chang
ing world.
THE PARALLEL between our
position and that of Britain be
fore her decision to join the Com
mon Market is not precise. But it
is instructive. In recent years, the
gap between ...the--Continent- and
the United Kingdom grew wider
because within its own protected
market Britain was isolated from
the booming economy of the
Western Continent.
We cannot afford to let a simi
lar gap open up between the
United States and the great new
and enlarged trading community.
The economic consequences for
us, but especially for Latin Ameri
ca and Japan, would be grim. The
political consequences of our
economic alientation from the
rest of the Western alliance would
be still worse.

In practical terms, this moans
that we shall have to reverse the
protectionist trend of the past
few years and set out on a deter
mined and unambiguously liberal
trade course. As part of this ef
fort, we must devise new proce
dures for negotiating reductions
of tariffs exacted on our exports.

Before World War 11, the Unit
ed States trade agreements were
negotiated on a bilateral basis.
That method was changed to suit
our postwar objective of increas
ing multilateral world trade, and
for the past 14 years we have con
ducted multilateral negotiations
through what is called the GATT.
NOW, AS WE ENTER an era
of increased and freer trade, we
shall have to discard the cumber
some system of negotiating tariff
reductions on an item-by-item
basis. The President should be
empowered to negotiate tariff re
ductions “across-the-board”—that
is to say to consider all items to
gether or at least in broad cate
gories rather than to bargain over
each item separately. This would
enable the President to negotiate
for similar broad reductions by
the Common Market and by other
advanced countries such as Japan
and Canada.

There is emerging a powerful
new trading community and, in
order to deal with it, we shall
have to have some new thoughts.

THEY HAVE prospered great
ly, and last summer Great Brit
tain decided to apply for full
membership on the understanding
that the vital interests of the
Commonwealth countries could
in one way and another be safe
guarded. Great Britain has now
been followed by Denmark, Ire
land and Norway, and most re
cently by the three classic Euro
pean neutrals, Switzerland, Swe
den and Austria.

The neutrals have agreed to ap
ply jointly lor associate member
ship. An associate member, pre
sumably, would participate in the
internal free trade within the
Common Market; it would, how
ever, keep away from the politi
cal association which looks, as yet
quite vaguely, towards some kind
of confederation.

Before long, there will come to
be a working arrangement em
bracing all the nineteen European
countries which belonged to the
first European organization lor
economic cooperation, the OEEC.

THE S E DEVELOPMENTS,
which stem originally from the
Marshall Plan, have always had
the warm approval of the Ameri
can government. We have worked
for a strong, prosperous, and
united European community
which would be a mainstay of
Western civilization. Now, if the
British negotiations in regard to
the interests of the Common
wealth are successful, there will
exist what since 1948 we have
always wanted to see.
Then we shall find that we have
to live with and trade with and
negotiate with an economic and
indeed political bloc which will in
a few years have a common tariff
against all the rest of the world
and free trade internally among
its members. It is bound to be
come also a great political power
in the world, and necessarily, in
deed by deliberate purpose, it will
have many of the attributes of
a new great world power.
This new community will have
within it 300 million people. It
will not only be the largest trad
ing unit in the world but its econ
omic and financial power will be
virtually equal to ours. As Mr.
Ball, the Under Secretary of State
for Economic Affairs, has pul it,
“the positions of relative econ
omic strength in the free world
have radically changed.”

AS A RESULT of the extraor
dinary rise in the productivity of
Western Europe, “the postwar de
pendence of Europe upon the
United State economic foreign
policy has now become an inter
dependence between Europe and
the United States.”

The economic and financial pre
eminence of the United States or
iginated in the First World War.
It grew even greater during the
Second World War when almost
all of Europe was occupied and
prostrated.
But the solitary American pre
eminence in the non-Communist
world was not a normal and
healthy thing. It was the reflec
tion of the sickness of Europe.
Morally and politically the de
pendence of Europe upon the
United States was unhealthy for
them and unhealthy for us. Now
Western Europe has recovered,
and we may be glad that we start
ed the recovery by proposing the
Marshall Plan.
WE MAY BE glad also that
Western Europe has responded,
largely under the guiding genius
of Mr. Jean Monnet, by institut
ing cooperative measures such as
OEEC, the European Payments
Union, the Coal and Steel Com
munity, Euratom and finally the
Common Market.
We are now long past the time

when wo need to worry about the
economic health of Europe. In
deed, we must begin to think
about devising ways in which we
and the Europeans can use our
resources to accomplish better
the tasks we have jointly in the
world.

In recent years, the economic
growth of the nations of the Com
mon Market has been faster than
that of the United States. Brit
ain’s growth has been slower. But
her coming participation in a
larger and less sheltered market
will provide the discipline of
wider competition and the stimu
lus of Europe’s economic boom.
In Prime Minister Macmillan’s
words, Britain will bo entering a
“bracing cold shower, not a re
laxing Turkish bath.”

SPURRED BY THE enormous
economic expansion of the Com
mon Market, trade has prospered
not only within the Common Mar
ket countries but between them
and the rest of the world. The so
called “trade-diverting” effects of
the new tariff arrangements have
proved to be negligible.

Although the growth of trade
among the nations of the Com
mon Market has been greater
than the growth of imports from
outside their bloc, the entire
world has benefited from the
economic growth of Western Eu
rope. Thus, for example, the
United States sales to the Com
mon Market area were 44 per cent
higher in 1960 than they were in
1959, and 36 per cent higher than
they were in 1958.
So far, then, the growth of a
major free trade stake in the
prosperity and unity of the West
ern society. But we cannot as
sume that this will continue un

less we make a careful adaptation
of our trade policies to this chang
ing world.
THE PARALLEL between our
position and that of Britain be
fore her decision to join the Com
mon Market is not precise. But it
is instructive. In recent years, the
gap between ...the--Continent- and
the United Kingdom grew wider
because within its own protected
market Britain was isolated from
the booming economy of the
Western Continent.
We cannot afford to let a simi
lar gap open up between the
United States and the great new
and enlarged trading community.
The economic consequences for
us, but especially for Latin Ameri
ca and Japan, would be grim. The
political consequences of our
economic alientation from the
rest of the Western alliance would
be still worse.

In practical terms, this moans
that we shall have to reverse the
protectionist trend of the past
few years and set out on a deter
mined and unambiguously liberal
trade course. As part of this ef
fort, we must devise new proce
dures for negotiating reductions
of tariffs exacted on our exports.

Before World War 11, the Unit
ed States trade agreements were
negotiated on a bilateral basis.
That method was changed to suit
our postwar objective of increas
ing multilateral world trade, and
for the past 14 years we have con
ducted multilateral negotiations
through what is called the GATT.
NOW, AS WE ENTER an era
of increased and freer trade, we
shall have to discard the cumber
some system of negotiating tariff
reductions on an item-by-item
basis. The President should be
empowered to negotiate tariff re
ductions “across-the-board”—that
is to say to consider all items to
gether or at least in broad cate
gories rather than to bargain over
each item separately. This would
enable the President to negotiate
for similar broad reductions by
the Common Market and by other
advanced countries such as Japan
and Canada.

There is emerging a powerful
new trading community and, in
order to deal with it, we shall
have to have some new thoughts.

be a working arrangement em
bracing all the nineteen European
countries which belonged to the
first European organization lor
economic cooperation, the OEEC.

THE S E DEVELOPMENTS,
which stem originally from the
Marshall Plan, have always had
the warm approval of the Ameri
can government. We have worked
for a strong, prosperous, and
united European community
which would be a mainstay of
Western civilization. Now, if the
British negotiations in regard to
the interests of the Common
wealth are successful, there will
exist what since 1948 we have
always wanted to see.
Then we shall find that we have
to live with and trade with and
negotiate with an economic and
indeed political bloc which will in
a few years have a common tariff
against all the rest of the world
and free trade internally among
its members. It is bound to be
come also a great political power
in the world, and necessarily, in
deed by deliberate purpose, it will
have many of the attributes of
a new great world power.
This new community will have
within it 300 million people. It
will not only be the largest trad
ing unit in the world but its econ
omic and financial power will be
virtually equal to ours. As Mr.
Ball, the Under Secretary of State
for Economic Affairs, has pul it,
“the positions of relative econ
omic strength in the free world
have radically changed.”

AS A RESULT of the extraor
dinary rise in the productivity of
Western Europe, “the postwar de
pendence of Europe upon the
United State economic foreign
policy has now become an inter
dependence between Europe and
the United States.”

The economic and financial pre
eminence of the United States or
iginated in the First World War.
It grew even greater during the
Second World War when almost
all of Europe was occupied and
prostrated.
But the solitary American pre
eminence in the non-Communist
world was not a normal and
healthy thing. It was the reflec
tion of the sickness of Europe.
Morally and politically the de
pendence of Europe upon the
United States was unhealthy for
them and unhealthy for us. Now
Western Europe has recovered,
and we may be glad that we start
ed the recovery by proposing the
Marshall Plan.
WE MAY BE glad also that
Western Europe has responded,
largely under the guiding genius
of Mr. Jean Monnet, by institut
ing cooperative measures such as
OEEC, the European Payments
Union, the Coal and Steel Com
munity, Euratom and finally the
Common Market.
We are now long past the time

when wo need to worry about the
economic health of Europe. In
deed, we must begin to think
about devising ways in which we
and the Europeans can use our
resources to accomplish better
the tasks we have jointly in the
world.

In recent years, the economic
growth of the nations of the Com
mon Market has been faster than
that of the United States. Brit
ain’s growth has been slower. But
her coming participation in a
larger and less sheltered market
will provide the discipline of
wider competition and the stimu
lus of Europe’s economic boom.
In Prime Minister Macmillan’s
words, Britain will bo entering a
“bracing cold shower, not a re
laxing Turkish bath.”

SPURRED BY THE enormous
economic expansion of the Com
mon Market, trade has prospered
not only within the Common Mar
ket countries but between them
and the rest of the world. The so
called “trade-diverting” effects of
the new tariff arrangements have
proved to be negligible.

Although the growth of trade
among the nations of the Com
mon Market has been greater
than the growth of imports from
outside their bloc, the entire
world has benefited from the
economic growth of Western Eu
rope. Thus, for example, the
United States sales to the Com
mon Market area were 44 per cent
higher in 1960 than they were in
1959, and 36 per cent higher than
they were in 1958.
So far, then, the growth of a
major free trade stake in the
prosperity and unity of the West
ern society. But we cannot as
sume that this will continue un

less we make a careful adaptation
of our trade policies to this chang
ing world.
THE PARALLEL between our
position and that of Britain be
fore her decision to join the Com
mon Market is not precise. But it
is instructive. In recent years, the
gap between ...the--Continent- and
the United Kingdom grew wider
because within its own protected
market Britain was isolated from
the booming economy of the
Western Continent.
We cannot afford to let a simi
lar gap open up between the
United States and the great new
and enlarged trading community.
The economic consequences for
us, but especially for Latin Ameri
ca and Japan, would be grim. The
political consequences of our
economic alientation from the
rest of the Western alliance would
be still worse.

In practical terms, this moans
that we shall have to reverse the
protectionist trend of the past
few years and set out on a deter
mined and unambiguously liberal
trade course. As part of this ef
fort, we must devise new proce
dures for negotiating reductions
of tariffs exacted on our exports.

Before World War 11, the Unit
ed States trade agreements were
negotiated on a bilateral basis.
That method was changed to suit
our postwar objective of increas
ing multilateral world trade, and
for the past 14 years we have con
ducted multilateral negotiations
through what is called the GATT.
NOW, AS WE ENTER an era
of increased and freer trade, we
shall have to discard the cumber
some system of negotiating tariff
reductions on an item-by-item
basis. The President should be
empowered to negotiate tariff re
ductions “across-the-board”—that
is to say to consider all items to
gether or at least in broad cate
gories rather than to bargain over
each item separately. This would
enable the President to negotiate
for similar broad reductions by
the Common Market and by other
advanced countries such as Japan
and Canada.

There is emerging a powerful
new trading community and, in
order to deal with it, we shall
have to have some new thoughts.

When Great Britain decided to
apply for full membership in the
European Economic Community,
known as the Common Market,
she set in motion a chain of events
which will involve deeply the
whole non-Communist world.

In the coming months, during
the next session of Congress, we
shall have to re-examine our econ

ways that there is no war, the is

The original Common Market,

The neutrals have agreed to ap

against all the rest of the world
and free trade internally among
its members. It is bound to be
come also a great political power
in the world, and necessarily, in
deed by deliberate purpose, it will
have many of the attributes of
a new great world power.
This new community will have
within it 300 million people. It
will not only be the largest trad
ing unit in the world but its econ
omic and financial power will be
virtually equal to ours. As Mr.
Ball, the Under Secretary of State
for Economic Affairs, has pul it,
“the positions of relative econ
omic strength in the free world
have radically changed.”

AS A RESULT of the extraor
dinary rise in the productivity of
Western Europe, “the postwar de
pendence of Europe upon the
United State economic foreign
policy has now become an inter
dependence between Europe and
the United States.”

The economic and financial pre
eminence of the United States or
iginated in the First World War.
It grew even greater during the
Second World War when almost
all of Europe was occupied and
prostrated.
But the solitary American pre
eminence in the non-Communist
world was not a normal and
healthy thing. It was the reflec
tion of the sickness of Europe.
Morally and politically the de
pendence of Europe upon the
United States was unhealthy for
them and unhealthy for us. Now
Western Europe has recovered,
and we may be glad that we start
ed the recovery by proposing the
Marshall Plan.
WE MAY BE glad also that
Western Europe has responded,
largely under the guiding genius
of Mr. Jean Monnet, by institut
ing cooperative measures such as
OEEC, the European Payments
Union, the Coal and Steel Com
munity, Euratom and finally the
Common Market.
We are now long past the time

when wo need to worry about the
economic health of Europe. In
deed, we must begin to think
about devising ways in which we
and the Europeans can use our
resources to accomplish better
the tasks we have jointly in the
world.

In recent years, the economic
growth of the nations of the Com
mon Market has been faster than
that of the United States. Brit
ain’s growth has been slower. But
her coming participation in a
larger and less sheltered market
will provide the discipline of
wider competition and the stimu
lus of Europe’s economic boom.
In Prime Minister Macmillan’s
words, Britain will bo entering a
“bracing cold shower, not a re
laxing Turkish bath.”

SPURRED BY THE enormous
economic expansion of the Com
mon Market, trade has prospered
not only within the Common Mar
ket countries but between them
and the rest of the world. The so
called “trade-diverting” effects of
the new tariff arrangements have
proved to be negligible.

Although the growth of trade
among the nations of the Com
mon Market has been greater
than the growth of imports from
outside their bloc, the entire
world has benefited from the
economic growth of Western Eu
rope. Thus, for example, the
United States sales to the Com
mon Market area were 44 per cent
higher in 1960 than they were in
1959, and 36 per cent higher than
they were in 1958.
So far, then, the growth of a
major free trade stake in the
prosperity and unity of the West
ern society. But we cannot as
sume that this will continue un

less we make a careful adaptation
of our trade policies to this chang
ing world.
THE PARALLEL between our
position and that of Britain be
fore her decision to join the Com
mon Market is not precise. But it
is instructive. In recent years, the
gap between ...the--Continent- and
the United Kingdom grew wider
because within its own protected
market Britain was isolated from
the booming economy of the
Western Continent.
We cannot afford to let a simi
lar gap open up between the
United States and the great new
and enlarged trading community.
The economic consequences for
us, but especially for Latin Ameri
ca and Japan, would be grim. The
political consequences of our
economic alientation from the
rest of the Western alliance would
be still worse.

In practical terms, this moans
that we shall have to reverse the
protectionist trend of the past
few years and set out on a deter
mined and unambiguously liberal
trade course. As part of this ef
fort, we must devise new proce
dures for negotiating reductions
of tariffs exacted on our exports.

Before World War 11, the Unit
ed States trade agreements were
negotiated on a bilateral basis.
That method was changed to suit
our postwar objective of increas
ing multilateral world trade, and
for the past 14 years we have con
ducted multilateral negotiations
through what is called the GATT.
NOW, AS WE ENTER an era
of increased and freer trade, we
shall have to discard the cumber
some system of negotiating tariff
reductions on an item-by-item
basis. The President should be
empowered to negotiate tariff re
ductions “across-the-board”—that
is to say to consider all items to
gether or at least in broad cate
gories rather than to bargain over
each item separately. This would
enable the President to negotiate
for similar broad reductions by
the Common Market and by other
advanced countries such as Japan
and Canada.

There is emerging a powerful
new trading community and, in
order to deal with it, we shall
have to have some new thoughts.

When Great Britain decided to
apply for full membership in the
European Economic Community,
known as the Common Market,
she set in motion a chain of events
which will involve deeply the
whole non-Communist world.

In the coming months, during
the next session of Congress, we
shall have to re-examine our econ
omic foreign policy. Assuming al
ways that there is no war, the is
sue will be how far and In what
way we should work with what
will then be the greatest trading
community on earth.
The original Common Market,
which was founded in 1957, con
sisted of six Western European
nations: France, West Germany,
Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium
and Luxembourg.

THEY HAVE prospered great
ly, and last summer Great Brit
tain decided to apply for full
membership on the understanding
that the vital interests of the
Commonwealth countries could
in one way and another be safe
guarded. Great Britain has now
been followed by Denmark, Ire
land and Norway, and most re
cently by the three classic Euro
pean neutrals, Switzerland, Swe
den and Austria.

The neutrals have agreed to ap
ply jointly lor associate member
ship. An associate member, pre
sumably, would participate in the
internal free trade within the
Common Market; it would, how
ever, keep away from the politi
cal association which looks, as yet
quite vaguely, towards some kind
of confederation.

Before long, there will come to
be a working arrangement em
bracing all the nineteen European
countries which belonged to the
first European organization lor
economic cooperation, the OEEC.

THE S E DEVELOPMENTS,
which stem originally from the
Marshall Plan, have always had
the warm approval of the Ameri
can government. We have worked
for a strong, prosperous, and
united European community
which would be a mainstay of
Western civilization. Now, if the
British negotiations in regard to
the interests of the Common
wealth are successful, there will
exist what since 1948 we have
always wanted to see.
Then we shall find that we have
to live with and trade with and
negotiate with an economic and
indeed political bloc which will in
a few years have a common tariff
against all the rest of the world
and free trade internally among
its members. It is bound to be
come also a great political power
in the world, and necessarily, in
