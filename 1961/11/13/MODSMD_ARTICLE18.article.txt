PKOCJTOBS NEEDED
Editor, The Daily:
Admittedly-, -one -great •responsi
bility of a university is to create
an atmosphere within which stu
dents may develop a sense of hon
or, responsibility, and self-respect.
An equally if not more impor
tant responsibility is the evalua
tion by comparison of the achieve
ment of ail students; such evalu
ation ultimately is the basis of
grad-school admission, scholarship
grants, graduation honors, and
job placement.
One instance of cheating on ex
ams (an expedient which the pres
sures of our competitive society
and demanding standards of
achievement in the modern world
coax into being, even among Stan
ford students to an alarming de
gree) can distort the entire evalu
ation process to the disadvantage
of many.
I denounce (this is like yelling
“down with General Washington”
at a meeting of the D.A.R.) the no
proctor system as unfair, as an
idealistic expression of a faith in
all men which few rationally hold.
A sense of honor, self-respect,
and responsibility can surely bo
built in other areas of academic
life: especially if we retain exist
ent standards and merely add the
realistic use of proctors, for the
protection of the students as a
whole.

YELL LEADER ELECTION
Editor, The Daily:

A number of students have ask
ed why no additional runoff was
held for head yell leader. The
students have a right to know the
considerations behind the decision.

The question was regarded from
two aspects. Considered from a
practical viewpoint, it was too late
to change the ballots at the time
Jones withdrew. ASSU by-laws
strictly forbid write-ins in the fi
nals. Also, Odell had stopped cam
paigning after the primaries. Thus
it would have meant an entirely
new election, an expensive and
time consuming operation, and
one which, judging from past ex

perience, would have met with an
overwhelming wave of student
boredom.

'Considered from a legal view
point, there was no precedent for
declaring such an election. Offici
ally, all but two candidates had al
ready been eliminated in the pri
maries. The by-laws make no pro
vision for any withdrawals, except
within 24 hours of the close of
nominations.

Thus, legally, the only proper
thing to do would have been to
refuse Jones’ withdrawal and run
the election as planned. Then if
Jones were elected, he could have
withdrawn afterward, and Sal
quist would have been appointed
under the vacancy provision of the
by-laws, as the second highest
candidate. But in this case the
election would have been meaning
less, for whether ho won or lost,
Salquist would have taken office.
Neither of these two considera
tions was overriding. If an election
between Odell and Salquist had
been either practical or legal, it
would have been held. That is, if it
had been possible without calling
a whole new election, it would
have been done, despite its ques
tionable legality. If such an elec
tion had been legally required, it
would have been held, despite its
impracticably. Neither of these
conditions was fulfilled.

These reasons were presented to
Legislature last Thursday night
and were unanimously approved.

LIPPMANN COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
I was both startled and dismay
ed by Walter Lippmann's column
on nuclear testing in last Friday’s
Daily. To the great credit of the
human imagination, within the
current context of war fever and
Erich Fromm’s “national para
noia.” the arms race has been vari
ously and capably attacked. In
view of Lippmann’s defense of
Kennedy’s “resumption to main
tain the advantage” policy, one as
pect of it occurs to me in particu
lar.

Mr. Lippmann says we must pre
serve the nuclear balance of pow
er, “If we -do-t-ha t, co-existence will
continue to be practiced and a
world war will continue to be high
ly improbable” (this in itself is
highly debatable).

In other words, the correct
world situation is one in which the
United States either already pos
sesses a nuclear advantage or re
tains the exclusive prerogative of
regaining that advantage.
Some white men also consider it
their privilege to prevent the Ne
gro from attaining equal social
and educational status. It is not.
Nor can the United States legiti
mately base a resumption decision
on personal considerations.

Why is it that what is right for
the United Slates is right—peri
od? We do live in a world. And
presumably that world, being
somewhat further removed from
but no less concerned with the?
arms race than the Pentagon, will
correctly attribute American re
sumption to anything but humani
tarian motives, or even intentions
of “stabilizing” the cold war.
Moreover, where do we get the
idea we are stabilizing anything?
As Mr. Lippmann points out, nu
clear power has ceased to be an
instrument of diplomacy. Neither
is it a commodity to which one or
the other country will ever con
cede to a deficit in.

Somebody’s got to stop some
time. Even better, somebody ought
to swallow his pride and muster
some real courage for a step in the
other direction.

MUX TRYOUTS
Editor, The Daily:
We, the interviewing committee
of the HR for the 1962 Model
United Nations, would like to ex
press our gratitude to the 66 in

dividuals who took the time and
interest to be interviewed but who
were- not- chosen; -ait-of whoimvtM <:■'
well qualified to serve on the
Stanford-Albanian delegation.
It is highly indicative of the
changing character of the Stan
ford student body that so many ex
tremely capable people should try
out for such a serious function.
It was almost impossible for us
to choose the 10 people finally de
cided on, to whom we wish the best
of luck in trying to represent Al
bania successfully.
