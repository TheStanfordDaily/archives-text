## GOLDEN BEARS TARNISHED Soccermen Down Cal In 'Big Boot', 7-4 
### 
Stanford demolished a highly
regarded California soccer squad
7-4 Saturday on the Stanford soc
cer field.

The Stanford Freshmen clobber
ed the Cal Frosh 8-1, while the
Junior Varsity emerged with a
2-2 tie.

Lopsided as the score is, it
doesn’t reflect how much Stan
ford dominated the somewhat tar
nished Golden Bears, Stanford had
the ball on the Cal half of the field
at least three-quarters of the
game, and destroyed two goalies
with a succession of powerful
shots.

THE STANFORD win knocked
Cal out of a possible berth in the
NCAA Far West Soccer Playoffs
to be held next week in San Fran
cisco. USF, despite being beaten
by City College of San Francisco
2-0 Saturday will represent the
NCISC with a 4-1-1 league record.
Cal ended up with 3-2-1. Stanford
finished with two wins and four
losses.

Stanford struck first, half-way
through the first quarter on an
Emmanuel Andah goal. Andah re
bounded a shot and put the ball
past the goalie from the midst of
a tangle of players in front of the
goal.
UAL WENT ahead briefly in the
second quarter on Bill Barreda’s
penalty kick, and a long shot by
Kun Choo, but Stanford regained
a 3-2 lead before the half and never
was headed. Albert Nnoli scored
the tying goal with the aid of a
pass from Andah, and then set up
Roberto Santa-Cruz for the go
ahead score. Santa-Cruz took Nno
li’s pass, dribbled right, and shot
the ball in.
Stanford scored twice within a
minute and a half in the third
quarter to put the game on ice.
After 7:45 were gone in the period,
Santa-Cruz’s perfect cross field
pass in front of the goal set up an
easy score for Larry Chukwudbe.
Shortly thereafter, Nnoli’s second

goal made it 5-2.
WITH A minute left in the quar
ter, a Cal goal brought the score
to 5-3, but Santa-Cruz scored again
with an assist to Chukwudbe, and
Pete Magowan made a long bullet
pass that rebounded off the be
wildered Cal goalie and was put in
by Chukwudbe. After that it was
all over but the shouting.
After the game, Stanford coach
Fred Prlddle said he had never
seen such team play. Everybody
was a star. The scoring was bal
anced. Chukwudbe, Nnoli and San
ta-Cruz all had two goals and an
assist, Andah had a goal and an
assist, and Magowan had an assist.
Ed Clark and Mike Tippett also
played well in the front line.
DESPITE CAL’S four goals.
Stanford’s defense also was im
pressive. In particular, the goal
tending of Dave Dierdorff was su
perb. He gave up only two goals
in the three quarters he worked.
On one of those goals, he was
bumped by a Cal man and was
knocked out of the line of the shot
by the collision.

Hunt Bascom, usually the start
ing goalie, played only one quar
ter, due to a broken toe, cracked
ribs, a cut and bruised head, and
a stiff leg. Of the two goals off
him, one was a penalty kick and
the other resulted from his short
kick on a rush out of the goal to
save a Stanford fullback.
THE DEFENSIVE work of
backs Mike Ero, Edgar Berner,
Don Burr, Epafuladito Kieuanaka,
and Rusty Williams kept Cal deep
in their own territory most of the
game and put pressure on inex
perienced Cal goalies.
The league soccer season is over,
but next week Stanford faces the
University of British Columbia,
always a power in Canada.
