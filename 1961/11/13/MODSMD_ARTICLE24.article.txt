This could be a year in which
not a single major college foot
ball team will emerge with a per
fect record.

Colorado was knocked from
the unbeaten-untied list by Utah,
21-12, Saturday leaving Texas,
Alabama and Rutgers as the only
major college survivors.

The top-ranked Longhorns
gored Baylor, 33-7; second-ranked
Alabama romped to a 66-0 victory
over Richmond, and unranked
Rutgers turned back Delaware,
27-19.
