# USC Downs Fumbling Cards
## Trojans Tally on Indian Bobbles 
### ART ROBINSON 
LOS ANGELES Stanford
boosted USC’s Trojans into a tie
for first place in the AAWU pen
nant race with the UCLA Bruins
by losing the football six times on
seven fumbles in a 30-1.1 loss to
the Troymen before 36,598 fans in
LA’s Memorial Colosseum Satur
day.

Despite four Indian hobbles in
the first 30 minutes of play, the
Trojans were held to a slim 12-7
halftime lead. Stanford dominated
the second quarter and gave every
indication of letting the Trojans
know they were in for a real hard
game after a shaky first period.

After USC tallied its second
touchdown about two minutes in
to the second stanza, quarterback
Rod Sears directed the Tribe to its
first score. Passing only once -
an eight-yarder to soph halfback
Danny Spence Sears relied on
the driving thrusts of Ken Baba
jian to move the Indians.
IN THE CARD scoring drive,
Babajian carried seven times, in
cluding a TD dive over the Trojan
line from two yards out. Injured
Stan Lindskog kicked the PAT to
make it 12-7.
Just two plays later, the Indians’
Gary Craig snared Trojan Bill
Nelson's pas-s that was high to
Troy’s sophomore end Hal Bedsole
and raced it back 27 yards to the
SC 42-yard stripe.
But then Sears pitched out wild
to Mike Barnes on the 37, and Tro
jan end Warren Stephenson, voted
the game’s outstanding lineman,
pounced on the loose pigskin all
the way back on the USC 46-yard
line.
THE HALF ENDED as the In
dians were mounting another
drive after Troy’s Ernie Jones
booted a beautiful 47-yard punt
out of bounds on the Card eight
yard marker.
USC’s first score of the day w’as
also the most spectacular). After
Craig punted dead to the Trojan
31, Pete Beathard, the top back of
the game according to the press
box poll, took off on a rollout
around right end for a 69-yard
scoring run.
Eluding several Indian tacklers,
Beathard cut to the sidelines, pick
ed up a herd of blockers and out
ran the Card’s last man, Jim
Shroyer. to scoring territory.
HALFTIME STATISTICS show
ed Stanford ahead in just about
every category except scoring as
the Indians controlled the ball on
43 plays to Troy’s 22. The Tribe
also showed a 12-7 first down
edge and outgained the home team
by 15 yards.
But any hopes for an Indian vic
tory on the part of the Stanford
supporters grouped in the west
corner of the giant Colosseum
soon evaporated as the Trojans
took Errol 1 Scott’s second half

kickoff 68 yards in nine plays for
a TD, scored again the next time
they got the ball, and added the
clincher with 3:30 to play in the
final period.
USC made the score 18-7 when
soph quarterback Beathard com
bined his own yardage consuming
rollouts and keepers with big full
back Ben Kilson’s power drives up
the middle. Wilson got the score
on a nine-yard plunge off left
tackle.

Jill MAPLE’S running try for
two points was short as Ihe Tro
jans missed their third straight
convfersitn. In fact, Troy was mar
velously inept at Ihe sometimes
important extra-point play, not
making even one in five tries.
It wasn’t only fumbles that hurt
the Indians: there were some ill
timed penalties, too. On the Tribe’s
first play of the second half, Sears
hit end Chris Jessen for 11 yards,
but a holding penalty nullified the
gain, forcing Stanford to punt
shortly thereafter.
Then Tom Walsh nailed Bea
thard for a six-yard loss from his
guard position, but the officials
calk'd C. B. Simons for piling on
to keep the USC drive going to
their fourth touchdown.
STILL UNDAUNTED by their
bad luck, the Cards went after an
other score with Sears throwing
strikes to Jessen, Steve Purcell
and Spence, while Babajian ran up

Ihe middle and around the USC
ends.
The little soph fullback got the
Indians’ second TD on a pitchout
around left end only 1:57 into the
fourth quarter. Sears passed com
plete to Jessen in the end zone for
the conversion as the Tribe trailed
only 24-15 with nearly a quarter
remaining.
But another fumble prevented
the Indians from mounting an
other drive, and Hal Tobin iced
the contest for Troy with their
fifth score late in the last period.
