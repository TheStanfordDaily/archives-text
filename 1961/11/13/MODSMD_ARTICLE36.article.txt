# Debate Squad Cops Top Prize In Weekend Speech Tourney
## 
### 
Stanford’s debate squad car
ried off the sweepstakes trophy,
awarded for the most outstand
ing team effort among 27 colleges
and universities entered in the
Modesto Invitational speech tour
nament held Friday and Satur
day. Debaters came from as far
away as Hawaii to take part.
Barrie Thorne and Karen
Stucky, competing in the junior
women’s division, walked off with
the top honors. Miss Stucky and
Miss Thorne won six consecutive
debates to capture the first-place
trophy.
In the senior division, three
Stanford men’s teams did almost
as well. Larry Neal and Chuck

Bischoff won five straight before
losing in the final round on a
split decision. Jim Woolsey and
Mike Hall tied for third, with
Mike Owen and Bill Noyes with
four victories each and a single
defeat.

In the individual events, the
top performance was by Bob
Mackey, whose oration earned
him second place.
The most important factor in
winning the sweepstakes trophy,
however-, was the overall team
performance. Barry Carter and
Dave Commons won three de
bates and lost one, and Steve
Corker and Ed Eisernan gained
the quarterfinals, both in the jun
ior men’s division.

Dick Weinig and Keith Winsell,
along with Bob Mockey and Eric
Kennell, won three out of four
preliminary rounds and just
failed to qualify for the semi
finals in the senior division.
