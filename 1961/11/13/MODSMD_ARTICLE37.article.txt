# Helliwell Wins NASA 'Dream' Radio Contract
## 
### 
A $45,000 “dream” contract has
been awarded to a Stanford sci
entist by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
“It may be different,” admitted
recipient Professor Robert A. Ilel
liwell of Stanford’s Radioscience
Laboratory, “hut it’s very sound.
“Our job will be to ‘dream up’
very-low-frequency (VLFt experi
ments for radio studies of the ion
osphere using rockets and satel
lites,” he explained.
“In the past we usually have had
to do this kind of dreaming in our
spare time. When you are working
with equipment as costly as rock
ets and satellites, planning an ex
periment should be a full-time
job."

Potential projects to be studied
will include putting VLF radio re
ceivers and transmitters aboard
space vehicles.
Radio signals sent from earth
and transmitted back from the
satellite can reveal new knowledge
of tho ionosphere- the electrical
ly charged layers of atmosphere
between 50 and 200 miles above
the earth’s surface which are used
to reflect radio signals for long
distance communications.
“One thing we hope for is to
hear the low-frequency radio noise
of solar bursts,” said Dr. Helliwell.
“These have never been heard be
cause those frequencies can’t get
through the ionosphere.
“If we put our receivers above
the ionized layers we should pick
up the VLF in solar bursts and
plenty of other strange radiation
that is bouncing around up there.
