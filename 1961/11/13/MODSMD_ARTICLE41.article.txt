# Prosperity To Double
## 
### 
By 1970, Americans will enjoy
an average family income of $lO,-
000 an.d their discretionary buying
power will nearly double, a Stan
ford expert forecast Friday.

Prof. Robert T. Davis made this
prediction at an affiliate seminar
in mar keting sponsored by the
Graduate School of Business.
Ho said rising outlays for re
search and development, increas
ed population, higher education,
and changes in family life patterns
will fuel the long-range boom.
But he warned his audience of
marketing experts that “unless
we successfully sell innovation, we
cannot achieve this growth.”
Historically. Davis noted, one or
two major, unplanned innovations
like the auto have sustained
successive stages of economic
growth in this country. Now, with
rapidly rising expenditures on re
search and development, planned
innovation promises to create a
whole series of new “growth” in
dustries.
Keeping up with consumers may
become increasingly difficult in
the future, Davis said.
