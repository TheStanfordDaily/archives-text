# 'Clean Up Campus,' A Phi O Demands
## 
### 
Alpha Phi Omega today launches its first annual “Clean Up the
Caimpus Week.
I hey will emphasize the need for a clean campus with a banner
across Lasuen St. at the Post Office-Bookstore Mall, and a window
hill of trash in the Western Civ Library, in case any Stanfordite

doesn't know what trash looks* 1
like.
President Bill Bauriedel of A
Phi O announced that the Univer
sity was cooperating in the cam
paign by placing eight new trash
containers at various campus
points including Frost Memorial
Amphitheater and the Post Office
area.
Bauriedel asked students lo dis
pose of matches, cigarette stubs
and packages in the proper
places, to put napkins, milk car
tons and wrappers into trash cans
in the Cellar and Snack Bar
areas, and to carry small litter
with them til they reach a trash
can.
Bauriedel said: “We'd like to
remind students, faculty and visi
tors that it is important to stop
litter before it starts; in other
words, don’t throw it down in the
first place.
"It costs ttie University SlB.OOO
a year just to keep the campus
clean; we’d like to help them save
some of that money through cam
pus cooperation."



“CLEAN UP THE CAMPUS WEEK” starts today with a window full
of trash in the Western Civ library. The idea, however, is to get
campus trash out of sight, not on display. The top photo is the way
too much of the campus looks now. Below is what A Phi O hopes
to see throughout the campus by the end of this week.
