# Russ Wants No War, Western Diplomats Say
## 
### 
BERLIN (UPD—Soviet actions
along the Berlin battle line and on
Moscow’s diplomatic front mean
premier Nikita Khrushchev is un
willing to risk war now. Western
diplomats said yesterday.
This is probably one of the two
main reasons Khrushchev dropped
hints in Moscow that he wants a
breather in Berlin, diplomats said.
THE other reason is that
Khrushchev has won much of
what he wants in Berlin, and
thinks it wise to let everyone on
both sides of the Iron Curtain di
gest this sitaufion before he makes
his next move.
Western diplomats here see no
more than such a hint in the “new
plan” for Berlin Khrushchev has
been reported pushing in Moscow
in recent days.
The plan is otherwise the same
old tune played in a new key, dip
lomats said.
BUT it does indicate Khrush
chev wants a period of talks in
place of military excursions and
alarms in Berlin, they added.
American military and diplo
matic leaders on the spot, diplo
matic sources said, suspected
from the start of the present chap
ter of the Berlin crisis that
Khrushchev was unwilling to
fight here and now.
Proof came the night of Oct. 27,
these sources said. That was the
night 10 Soviet tanks rolled up to
the border after an American mili
tary police escort went into East
Berlin to assist an American civil
ian delayed by East German po
lice.
IT APPEARED only a matter of
time until )he East German re
gime ordered its own tanks to the
border to prevent such incursions
across what the Communists
claim is a state frontier.
Instead, the Soviets sent their
own tanks to the border.
“If the East Germans had sent
their own tanks to the border.” ac
cording to a highly-placed diplo
mat. “the United States would just
for the record have had to send
another military escort into East
Berlin to demonstrate Western Al
lied right to freedom of circula
tion throughout the city.
