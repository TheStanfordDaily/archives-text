# Canon Bryan Green To Speak All Week To Farm Audiences
## 
### 
Canon Bryan Green, the world
famed English clergyman who
drew crowds totalling 20,000 in
five days at Stanford in 1954, will
begin a four-day lecture series on
“Basic Christianity” at 7:45 to
night in Memorial Church.
In addition, he will deliver an
other four-day lecture series starl
ing at 4:15 p.m. today in Cubber
ley Auditorium on “Love, Friend
ship, and Marriage A Basis for
Sex Morality.” On Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday, the
series will be held at 4:15 in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
Tonight’s lecture had originally
been scheduled for 7:30, but be
cause of numerous requests from
students who thought that they
would be late because of house
meetings. Canon Green asked that
the lecture be put back 15 min
utes. In t his way, he said, he would
not interfere with a “Sacred Cow”
of the University. On the follow
ing three nights, the time will be
7:30 p.m.
STUDENTS ARE particularly
urged to arrive early tomorrow -so
that they won’t be shut out by the
many townspeople. On one occa
sion in 1954, 600 students had to
be turned away from one of Canon
Green’s lectures in Memorial Au
ditorium.
The Anglican minister from Bir
mingham emphasized one point in
particular;
“I want to make it absolutely
clear to the Stanford -students that
my lecture in Memorial Church
will be just that lectures. There
will be no prayers or service. This
will allow our Roman Catholic
brethren to come. I also want to
stress that my lectures will never
last more than 60 minutes. In this

way, students can return to their
homework at 8:30.”
(ANON GREEN’S lectures on
“Basie Christianity” are meant
particularly for the inquirers and
for those who have many doubts
and questions about religion. He
has stressed that those who are in
terested in his theme should try to
attend the full series of four lec
tures, as they hang together in a
unit.
Canon Green has won acclaim
while speaking at many of the top
universities of the English-speak
ing world, because he has earned a
reputation of knowing exactly
how to speak to the modern, in
quiring college student.
He is such a popular speaker
that he is usually booked up about
three years in advance. He has
been described as “one of the great
preachers in the Anglican Church
(Episcopal and Church of Eng
land).”
CANON GREEN’S whirlwind
schedule will also include visits to
18 living residence for lunches and
dinners and question-and-answer
periods after his evening lectures.
Jn addition, he will meet with
the Newman Club on Wednesday
evening and will address the
YWCA luncheon group on Thurs
day. He will be available for per
sonal consultations in the Chap
lain’s office in the afternoons.
Canon Green is Rector of Bir
mingham, the second largest city
in Britain, Besides his preaching,
ho has written several widely-ac
claimed books, his most recent be
ing “Christians Alive” (Scrib
ners), available at the Stanford
bookstore. He writes for some of
Britain’s largest papers and also
has frequent radio and TV shows.
He is married and has a son and
daughter.
BRYAN GREEN, who last week
received an honorary doctorate at
Manitoba University in Canada, is
known for his flashing English
wit. Ho once said, “You know,
when I was young, I heard of the
Christian kiss. Really, it seemed
quite dull to me. I much preferred
the other sort.”
One noted story about Canon
Green concerns the time that a
drunk started to climb in his pul
pit while he was giving his ser
mon. Bryan Green looked him
squarely in the face and said,
"Now, listen here, my dear fel
low, only one of us can do the
talking. And fame going to do it,
and you are going to sit down and
listen.”
The drunk did.
ONCE, CANON Green was
heckled by a Communist at a fac
tory who asked, “What are you
trying to do, ram religion down
our throats?!”
Canon Green paused a moment
and then said;
“Yes.”
Canon Green will answer ques
tions tonight at Branner from
9:30-10:30, and at Toyon from
10:30-11:30.

10:30-11:30.
Canon Bryan Green, the world
famed English clergyman who
drew crowds totalling 20,000 in
five days at Stanford in 1954, will
begin a four-day lecture series on
“Basic Christianity” at 7:45 to
night in Memorial Church.
In addition, he will deliver an
other four-day lecture series starl
ing at 4:15 p.m. today in Cubber
ley Auditorium on “Love, Friend
ship, and Marriage A Basis for
Sex Morality.” On Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday, the
series will be held at 4:15 in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
Tonight’s lecture had originally
been scheduled for 7:30, but be
cause of numerous requests from
students who thought that they
would be late because of house
meetings. Canon Green asked that
the lecture be put back 15 min
utes. In t his way, he said, he would
not interfere with a “Sacred Cow”
of the University. On the follow
ing three nights, the time will be
7:30 p.m.
STUDENTS ARE particularly
urged to arrive early tomorrow -so
that they won’t be shut out by the
many townspeople. On one occa
sion in 1954, 600 students had to
be turned away from one of Canon
Green’s lectures in Memorial Au
ditorium.
The Anglican minister from Bir
mingham emphasized one point in
particular;
“I want to make it absolutely
clear to the Stanford -students that
my lecture in Memorial Church
will be just that lectures. There
will be no prayers or service. This
will allow our Roman Catholic
brethren to come. I also want to
stress that my lectures will never
last more than 60 minutes. In this

way, students can return to their
homework at 8:30.”
(ANON GREEN’S lectures on
“Basie Christianity” are meant
particularly for the inquirers and
for those who have many doubts
and questions about religion. He
has stressed that those who are in
terested in his theme should try to
attend the full series of four lec
tures, as they hang together in a
unit.
Canon Green has won acclaim
while speaking at many of the top
universities of the English-speak
ing world, because he has earned a
reputation of knowing exactly
how to speak to the modern, in
quiring college student.
He is such a popular speaker
that he is usually booked up about
three years in advance. He has
been described as “one of the great
preachers in the Anglican Church
(Episcopal and Church of Eng
land).”
CANON GREEN’S whirlwind
schedule will also include visits to
18 living residence for lunches and
dinners and question-and-answer
periods after his evening lectures.
Jn addition, he will meet with
the Newman Club on Wednesday
evening and will address the
YWCA luncheon group on Thurs
day. He will be available for per
sonal consultations in the Chap
lain’s office in the afternoons.
Canon Green is Rector of Bir
mingham, the second largest city
in Britain, Besides his preaching,
ho has written several widely-ac
claimed books, his most recent be
ing “Christians Alive” (Scrib
ners), available at the Stanford
bookstore. He writes for some of
Britain’s largest papers and also
has frequent radio and TV shows.

BRYAN GREEN, who last week
received an honorary doctorate at
Manitoba University in Canada, is
known for his flashing English
wit. Ho once said, “You know,
when I was young, I heard of the
Christian kiss. Really, it seemed
quite dull to me. I much preferred
the other sort.”
One noted story about Canon
Green concerns the time that a
drunk started to climb in his pul
pit while he was giving his ser
mon. Bryan Green looked him
squarely in the face and said,
"Now, listen here, my dear fel
low, only one of us can do the
talking. And fame going to do it,
and you are going to sit down and
listen.”
The drunk did.
ONCE, CANON Green was
heckled by a Communist at a fac

trying to do, ram religion down
our throats?!”
Canon Green paused a moment
and then said;
“Yes.”

tions tonight at Branner from
9:30-10:30, and at Toyon from
10:30-11:30.
Canon Bryan Green, the world
famed English clergyman who
drew crowds totalling 20,000 in
five days at Stanford in 1954, will
begin a four-day lecture series on
“Basic Christianity” at 7:45 to
night in Memorial Church.
In addition, he will deliver an
other four-day lecture series starl
ing at 4:15 p.m. today in Cubber
ley Auditorium on “Love, Friend
ship, and Marriage A Basis for
Sex Morality.” On Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday, the
series will be held at 4:15 in Din
kelspiel Auditorium.
Tonight’s lecture had originally
been scheduled for 7:30, but be
cause of numerous requests from
students who thought that they
would be late because of house
meetings. Canon Green asked that
the lecture be put back 15 min
utes. In t his way, he said, he would
not interfere with a “Sacred Cow”
of the University. On the follow
ing three nights, the time will be
7:30 p.m.
STUDENTS ARE particularly
urged to arrive early tomorrow -so
that they won’t be shut out by the
many townspeople. On one occa
sion in 1954, 600 students had to
be turned away from one of Canon
Green’s lectures in Memorial Au
ditorium.
The Anglican minister from Bir
mingham emphasized one point in
particular;
“I want to make it absolutely
clear to the Stanford -students that
my lecture in Memorial Church
will be just that lectures. There
will be no prayers or service. This
will allow our Roman Catholic
brethren to come. I also want to
stress that my lectures will never
last more than 60 minutes. In this

way, students can return to their
homework at 8:30.”
(ANON GREEN’S lectures on
“Basie Christianity” are meant
particularly for the inquirers and
for those who have many doubts
and questions about religion. He
has stressed that those who are in
terested in his theme should try to
attend the full series of four lec
tures, as they hang together in a
unit.
Canon Green has won acclaim
while speaking at many of the top
universities of the English-speak
ing world, because he has earned a
reputation of knowing exactly
how to speak to the modern, in
quiring college student.
He is such a popular speaker
that he is usually booked up about
three years in advance. He has
been described as “one of the great
preachers in the Anglican Church
(Episcopal and Church of Eng
land).”
CANON GREEN’S whirlwind
schedule will also include visits to
18 living residence for lunches and
dinners and question-and-answer
periods after his evening lectures.
Jn addition, he will meet with
the Newman Club on Wednesday
evening and will address the
YWCA luncheon group on Thurs
day. He will be available for per
sonal consultations in the Chap
lain’s office in the afternoons.
Canon Green is Rector of Bir
mingham, the second largest city
in Britain, Besides his preaching,
ho has written several widely-ac
claimed books, his most recent be
ing “Christians Alive” (Scrib
ners), available at the Stanford
bookstore. He writes for some of
Britain’s largest papers and also
has frequent radio and TV shows.
He is married and has a son and
daughter.
BRYAN GREEN, who last week
received an honorary doctorate at
Manitoba University in Canada, is
known for his flashing English
wit. Ho once said, “You know,
when I was young, I heard of the
Christian kiss. Really, it seemed
quite dull to me. I much preferred
the other sort.”
One noted story about Canon
Green concerns the time that a
drunk started to climb in his pul
pit while he was giving his ser
mon. Bryan Green looked him
squarely in the face and said,
"Now, listen here, my dear fel
low, only one of us can do the
talking. And fame going to do it,
and you are going to sit down and
listen.”
The drunk did.
ONCE, CANON Green was
heckled by a Communist at a fac
tory who asked, “What are you
trying to do, ram religion down
our throats?!”
Canon Green paused a moment
and then said;
“Yes.”
