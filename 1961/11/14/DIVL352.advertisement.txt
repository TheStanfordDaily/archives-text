We’re looking forward to meeting you
We’ll be on the campus on the dates listed below, ready to give
engineering and science seniors information on space-age careers
in a dynamic industry.
If you are looking for a company offering assignments on pro
grams of unique interest and career potential, you’ll be interested
in the advantages Boeing can offer you.
Boeing, for instance, is a major contractor on such advanced
programs as the Dyna-Soar manned space glider; the solid-fuel
Minuterhan ICBM, and the Bomarc defense missile system.
Hoeing is also the world’s foremost designer and builder of multi
jet aircraft, including the eight-jet B-52H missile bomber, the
KC-135 tanker-transport, the C-135 cargo-jet, and the famous
Hoeing 707, 720 and 727 jetliners. In addition, Boeing’s Vertol
Division is one of America’s leading builders of helicopters.
Research projects at Boeing are under way in such advanced
fields as celestial mechanics, solid state physics, nuclear and
plasma physics, flight sciences, space flight and propulsion.
Expanding Boeing programs offer exceptional opportunities to
holders of 8.5., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in aeronautical, mechani
cal, civil, electrical-electronic and industrial engineering, and in
engineering mechanics, engineering physics as well as in mathe
matics and physics. At Boeing you’ll work in a small group where
individual ability and initiative get plenty of visibility. You’ll
enjoy many other advantages, including an opportunity to take
graduate studies at company expense to help you get ahead faster.
Drop in to your Placement Office and arrange for an interview.
We’re looking forward to meeting you!
