# SOUTH AFRICA
## U.S. Can Speed End to Apartheid 
### SUE BROWN 
The potential role of the U.S. in forcing the necessary and in
evitable end of apartheid rule in South Africa before communism
has more appeal to Africans was stressed last night by Leslie Rubin.
Rubin, a white leader for racial equality in South Africa, is pro
fessor of law at University College of Ghana. He is co-founder of the

Liberal party, and was a South
African Senate representative for
the Africans until African repre
sentation was outlawed last year.
THE REPUBLIC of South Af
rica. under its present govern
ment. has “voluntarily abdicated
its rights for the present to parti
cipate in the exciting new develop
ment of the 200 million peoples of
Africa,” stated Rubin.
Under Verwoerd’s leadership,
he said, the Parliament ha-s passed
a series of laws which force the
old pattern of the separation of
races into the rigid apartheid plan.
The,population, explained Ru
bin, is now forced to live in “neat
racial compartments which make
it more and more impossible for
political or social crossing from
one compartment into another.”
By these laws the Africans are
being forced to live in townships
completely outside of white urban

areas.
THE MINING and industrial
economy of South Africa is de
pendent on the supply of African
labor, Rubin explained.
“Thus,” he said, “the policy of
the present government is to in
sure that the African is kept in a
state of inferiority and also to
know that the labor necessary to
create the wealth of the country
will be available.”
The 11 million Africans in South
Africa are not at all represented
in the present parliament, explain
ed Rubin. Prior to that, they were
represented in the lower house by
3 of the 159 white representatives,
and in the Senate by 4 of the 89
Senators.
THE SETTLED white popula
tion of 3 million thus today has
the only voice in government, and
the African population Rubin said,
“has been reduced to a condition
resembling slavery.”
Rubin believes that leading pow
ers of the world, especially the
U.S.. must realize now that this
present state of affairs cannot
continue, and that it will come to
an end much sooner than most peo
ple realize.”
“The patience of these people is
exhausted,” he continued. The
Africans are prevented from or
ganizing national movements, and
their leaders have been imprison
ed or banned. We can only expect
more and more intensive out
bursts like that which occurred in
Sharpeville last year, believes Ru
bin. And we can expect that this
spontaneous violence will continue
to meet with police violence.
“I CAN FORESEE nothing
other than a complete breakdown
of law and order,” said Rubin, if
the current policy is allowed to
continue.
Outside pressure in the form of
economic sanctions not in the
form of more empty resolution—
is the best way of averting this dis
aster, Rubin believes.
If this occurs, he said, “there is
good chance that those in banking,
industry, and commerce in South
Africa will force achange.”
IN THIS WAY the eventual
emancipation of the Africans
would be possible with a minimum
of violence.
If African leaders continue to
be restricted, said Rubin, if the
Republic of South Africa dissolves
in a state of disorder, and if the
U.S. goes on record as having done
no more than pass more resolu
tions, the Africans will tell us,
“you have let us down.”
Then, concluded Rubin, “we will
have the kind of -situation where
Communism will appeal to the Af
ricans.”

Republic of South Africa dissolves
in a state of disorder, and if the
U.S. goes on record as having done
no more than pass more resolu
tions, the Africans will tell us,
“you have let us down.”
Then, concluded Rubin, “we will
have the kind of -situation where
Communism will appeal to the Af
ricans.”
The potential role of the U.S. in forcing the necessary and in
evitable end of apartheid rule in South Africa before communism
has more appeal to Africans was stressed last night by Leslie Rubin.
Rubin, a white leader for racial equality in South Africa, is pro
fessor of law at University College of Ghana. He is co-founder of the

Liberal party, and was a South
African Senate representative for
the Africans until African repre
sentation was outlawed last year.
THE REPUBLIC of South Af
rica. under its present govern
ment. has “voluntarily abdicated
its rights for the present to parti
cipate in the exciting new develop
ment of the 200 million peoples of
Africa,” stated Rubin.
Under Verwoerd’s leadership,
he said, the Parliament ha-s passed
a series of laws which force the
old pattern of the separation of
races into the rigid apartheid plan.
The,population, explained Ru
bin, is now forced to live in “neat
racial compartments which make
it more and more impossible for
political or social crossing from
one compartment into another.”
By these laws the Africans are
being forced to live in townships
completely outside of white urban

areas.
THE MINING and industrial
economy of South Africa is de
pendent on the supply of African
labor, Rubin explained.
“Thus,” he said, “the policy of
the present government is to in
sure that the African is kept in a
state of inferiority and also to
know that the labor necessary to
create the wealth of the country
will be available.”
The 11 million Africans in South
Africa are not at all represented
in the present parliament, explain
ed Rubin. Prior to that, they were
represented in the lower house by
3 of the 159 white representatives,
and in the Senate by 4 of the 89
Senators.
THE SETTLED white popula
tion of 3 million thus today has
the only voice in government, and
the African population Rubin said,
“has been reduced to a condition
resembling slavery.”
Rubin believes that leading pow
ers of the world, especially the
U.S.. must realize now that this
present state of affairs cannot
continue, and that it will come to
an end much sooner than most peo
ple realize.”
“The patience of these people is
exhausted,” he continued. The
Africans are prevented from or
ganizing national movements, and
their leaders have been imprison
ed or banned. We can only expect
more and more intensive out
bursts like that which occurred in
Sharpeville last year, believes Ru
bin. And we can expect that this
spontaneous violence will continue
to meet with police violence.
“I CAN FORESEE nothing
other than a complete breakdown
of law and order,” said Rubin, if
the current policy is allowed to
continue.
Outside pressure in the form of
economic sanctions not in the
form of more empty resolution—
is the best way of averting this dis
aster, Rubin believes.
If this occurs, he said, “there is
good chance that those in banking,
industry, and commerce in South
Africa will force achange.”
IN THIS WAY the eventual
emancipation of the Africans
would be possible with a minimum
of violence.
If African leaders continue to
be restricted, said Rubin, if the
Republic of South Africa dissolves
in a state of disorder, and if the
U.S. goes on record as having done
