### 
WASHINGTON (DPI) The
United States and Britain called
on Russia Monday to resume nu
clear test ban negotiations about
Nov. 28. But this country served
notice it would continue testing
until a treaty was signed.
In notes delivered in Moscow,
the Western Big Two proposed re
opening Geneva talks that were
halted Sept. 9 when the United Na
tions General Assembly was de
bating the test question. Russia
previously had opened the test
series capped by its 55-60 megaton
explosion.
In a separate statement, the
State Department said that, with
Russia continuing to test, the
United States “will pursue its own
program of carefully circumscrib
ed testing” until agreement is
reached on any Test ban treaty.
