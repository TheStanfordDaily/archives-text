# 'Clean Up' Week Deserves Support
## 
### 
A Phi O is conducting a drive this week which should be un
necessary—but which unfortunately isn’t. The energetic Alpha Phi
Omega men are urging the campus to make a special effort to
“Clean Up” this week.
Their cause is a good one, no matter how mundane it may seem
to some. Certain areas of the campus are an eyesore and ought to
be cleaned up—and kept clean by students refraining from tossing
their litter about.
One spot which catches our eye regularly is the area outside
the door to the Communication-Journalism Department. By late
afternoon it is sprinkled with cigarette butts and not a a pleasant
sight. It is to be hoped that those who take a smoke break there
will drop the remains of their cigarettes into a nearby receptacle.
There are other areas just as bad, particularly on Quad. (Which
reminds us, whatever happened to the rule that there was to be no
smoking on Quad, by order of Mrs. Stanford?) Certainly there is
no reason why persons can’t dispose of trash and cigarette butts in
the proper places instead of littering the campus.
In other words, a little “preventive maintenance” on the part of
the University community should take care of the problem. As Bill
Bauriedcl, drive director, puts it, “We’d like to remind students,
faculty and visitors that it is important to stop litter before it starts;
in other words, don’t throw it down in the first place.”
This is A Phi O’s first annual “Clean Up the Campus Week.” We
hope it’s the last one that is needed.
