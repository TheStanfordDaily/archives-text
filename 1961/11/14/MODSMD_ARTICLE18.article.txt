WIJS DRIVE
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to your editorial of
Nov. 13, we, of the World Univer
sity Service, would like to take
this opportunity to restate the
underlying objectives of our pro
gram.
Our primary purpose is the edu
cation of the student body to the

needs of university students
throughout the world. Student
apathy to these various needs can
only be fought by the continual
efforts of charity organizations to
effectively present the problems
to the students. The use of the un
usual ‘gimmick’ is a tried and high
ly successful, method of awaken
ing the group and the individual
to the presence of the organization
on campus.
These devices, however, are only
a part of the entire project which
includes discussions, speakers,
and the distribution of various
publications.
The second objective of our pro
gram is the collection of money,
books and clothing to help supply
the needy campuses overseas.
Stanford’s poor response to this
drive is discouraging.
Is must be remembered, though,
that every contribution, no matter
how small, is of some use. We,
who are actively participating in
the WUS drive, feel that the in
terest of a few is far better than
no interest at all.

Editor, The Daily:
Oh almighty critic who sitteth
in the seat of judgment! Is it real
ly necessary to condemn, so vigor
ously, that which adds a little light
to an otherwise dismal football ex
hibition? (Cards vs. Oregon).
I would consider such an event
involving Mr. Jones an unfortun
ate accident but he certainly
should not be labelled a “public
ass” which is, in fact, the insinua
tion here.
The demonstration put on by
Mr. Jones’ opponent on this same
day, was clever and rated humor
ous by the alumni and some of the
faculty seated around me, as indi
cated by their laughter, which
didn’t at all appear restrained.
The conclusion to the article,
“God is good, God is great, Yeaaaa
GOD!” is what should be ruled
asinine. Why? Because it implies
that the writer of this column
seems to think these yell leaders
use no discretion in WHEN they
exert themselves in this direction.
I would tend to give the Univer
sity a little more credit with re
gard to its choice of students at
Stanford, since part of the en
trance requirements are on the
basis of their general behavior.
Wouldn’t this be a dismal,
dreary and dingy world in which
to live if it were void of the risque,
the subtle—yes, and even the ma
licious remarks.

involving Mr. Jones an unfortun
ate accident but he certainly
should not be labelled a “public
ass” which is, in fact, the insinua
tion here.
The demonstration put on by
Mr. Jones’ opponent on this same
day, was clever and rated humor
ous by the alumni and some of the
faculty seated around me, as indi
cated by their laughter, which
didn’t at all appear restrained.
The conclusion to the article,
“God is good, God is great, Yeaaaa
GOD!” is what should be ruled
asinine. Why? Because it implies
that the writer of this column
seems to think these yell leaders
use no discretion in WHEN they
exert themselves in this direction.
I would tend to give the Univer
sity a little more credit with re
gard to its choice of students at
Stanford, since part of the en
trance requirements are on the
basis of their general behavior.
Wouldn’t this be a dismal,
dreary and dingy world in which
to live if it were void of the risque,
the subtle—yes, and even the ma
licious remarks.

Editor, The Daily:
In reference to your editorial of
Nov. 13, we, of the World Univer
sity Service, would like to take
this opportunity to restate the
underlying objectives of our pro
gram.
Our primary purpose is the edu
cation of the student body to the

needs of university students
throughout the world. Student
apathy to these various needs can
only be fought by the continual
efforts of charity organizations to
effectively present the problems
to the students. The use of the un
usual ‘gimmick’ is a tried and high
ly successful, method of awaken
ing the group and the individual
to the presence of the organization
on campus.
These devices, however, are only
a part of the entire project which
includes discussions, speakers,
and the distribution of various
publications.
The second objective of our pro
gram is the collection of money,
books and clothing to help supply
the needy campuses overseas.
Stanford’s poor response to this
drive is discouraging.
Is must be remembered, though,
that every contribution, no matter
how small, is of some use. We,
who are actively participating in
the WUS drive, feel that the in
terest of a few is far better than
no interest at all.

Oh almighty critic who sitteth
in the seat of judgment! Is it real

ously, that which adds a little light
to an otherwise dismal football ex
hibition? (Cards vs. Oregon).
I would consider such an event
involving Mr. Jones an unfortun
ate accident but he certainly
should not be labelled a “public
ass” which is, in fact, the insinua
tion here.
