LEOPOLDVILLE (UPD—Con
golese troops from the leftist
stronghold of Stanleyville were re
ported yesterday to have arrested
and beaten 13 Italian air crewmen
flying for the United Nations in
the Congo’s easternmost province
of Kivu.

Informed U.N. sources said the
Italians were seized at gunpoint
Saturday. They were crew mem
bers of two cargo transport planes
that flew in a shipment of scout
cars to Malayan U.N. troops sta
tioned in the Kivu town of Kindu.

THE Italians wore having lunch
when the Congolese soldiers
rushed in and abruptly arrested
them. Observers believed the Con
golese apparently thought the
Italians were running in arms.
The Central Congolese govern
ment at Leopoldville said it would
dispatch a joint military-civil mis
sion to Kindu today to try to ar
range the Italians’ release.
One of the members of the mis
sion was Gen. Victor Lundula, mil
itary chief of Vice Premier An
toine Gizenga’s Stanleyville re
gime. Lundula is returning home
from Leopoldville talks via Kindu
province.

Others on the commission were
Congolese Interior Minister Chris
topher Gbenye and U.N. represen
tative Karl Eglund of Sweden.
CENTRAL government Premier
Cyrille Adoula, meanwhile, con
firmed Maj. Gen. Joseph Mobutu
as commander-in-chief of the Con
golese army, ending a year-long
wrangle between Mobutu and Lun
dula over who was to head up the
armed forces.

Lundula was named commander
of the Stanleyville area army
group. He will be subordinate to
Mobutu, the one-time strongman
of the Leopoldville government
who carried the highest military
rank in the Congolese army.
