# INDIVIDUAL OPINION
## Peace Demonstration Report 
### ROSS HERMANN Daily Staff Writer 
Try mingling in a peace demon
stration sometime. It’s an experi
ence that should be a part of every
one’s liberal education.

I had such an opportunity last
Saturday when I went up to Ber
keley to witness a peace demon
stration sponsored by the Student
Peace Union on the occasion of a
Veterans’ Day parade.
About 100 students displayed
placards such as “Unilateral Ini
tiative,” “Strontium 90, Humanity
0,” “Dinosaurs, All Brawn, No
Brain, Now Extinct,” and "Speak
Softly and Carry a Modest
Bough.”
But in order to probe the real
character of the demonstration it
was necessary to go beneath the
propaganda slogans to find out
what these people were thinking.
ONE UNWASHED female ac
costed me and asked about ISI (In
tercollegiate Society of Individu
alists, a conservative student po
litical organization).
“Oh, that’s one of those semi
secret, neo-fascist groups,” I said
with a humorous tone to my voice.
I waited for a smile to crack on her
face, but it didn’t.
“That’s just wbat I thought,”
she said seriously.
“Would you be the sort of per
son then who would say that all
military men and police are by def
inition fascists?”
“Yes, that’s basically correct,”
she replied.
“WHAT ABOUT General Eisen
hower? Is he a fascist?”
“I think that given certain cir
cumstances Eisenhower could
have acted like a fascist. He has
that kind of mind.”
“What would you call your phi
losophy?”
“I don’t have a philosophy. I
can’t understand all that analyti
cal stuff. I have a psychological
interpretation of things.”
“Then you’re a behaviorist?”
“A behaviorist? What’s that?”
WHILE I was talking with this
creature, a boy of junior high
school age wearing a Student
Peace Union button came up be
hind me, and whenever a unit of
Marines passed, he would give a
Sieg Heil and shout, “There goes

the Wehrmacht!”, or when a con
tingent of young majorettes
marched by, “Look at the Young
Fascist League!”
Meanwhile a friend of mine was
encountering similar experiences
in another part of the crowd.
When a shabbily-dressed man
carrying a sign, “Incineration
I prefer Communism!”, entered
the ranks of the demonstrators,
an organizer of the group named
Bogdan commented, “Well it’s too
bad that the rest of us have to
limit ourselves to carrying these
half-spirited signs and can’t ex
press our true feelings like he is.”
INCIDENTALLY, Bogdan wore
a small red flag in his lapel which
he explained was a symbol of Cas
tro’s July 26 movement.
About this time an executive of
ficer of SLATE who had helped
organize the demonstration mis
took one of us for a dedicated
peace marcher and demanded,
“Why aren’t you people down at
Stanford doing anything? You
seem to think you’re superior to
the rest of us.
"You’ve got to get more strikes,
more demonstrations, more acti
vist speech-making, and propagan
dizing down there if the move
ment is going to gain student sup
port.
“I WILL admit that your vigil
on the library lawn was in the
right direction, but you’ve simply
got to get a more activist attitude
down there!”
(It is understood that local rep
resentatives of the Student Peace
Union will soon try to organize a
Peace Caucus here at Stanford as
a front organization for their
group.)
As the demonstration which be

gan at 8 a.m., dragged into the
mid-morning hours, comments
from the participants became
more frequent and more frustrat
ed.

“OH GOD,” moaned a girl, “just
look at that amorphous mass of
dullardus Americanus across the
street waiting for the parade. I
can’t hear to think of the long
years of planning, scheming, and
agitation before we convince them
of the truth. Our victory will not
come easily.”
An impulsive young man said to
his more restrained girl friend,
“This non-violent demonstrating
is okay for the lime being, but in
the future we’ve got to have a
more militant group to ever
spread our influence.

“What I’d like to see would be
the whole lot of us jump in the
middle of the street en masse so
that these Fascist bastards out
there in their SA uniforms
couldn’t goose-step past the re
viewing stand anymore!”
“QUIET, IVAN,” said the girl.
"Please try to contain yourself, at
least for today. We just can’t start
our movement by giving a lot of
uneducated bystanders an unfa
vorable impression of the Student
Peace Union.”

When a VFW poppy seller en
tered the group of demonstrators
one of the organizers spread in
struct ions.

“Now everybody, we’ve all got
to buy poppies when this militar
ist comes by. We’ve got to look as
legitimate and patriotic as pos
sible. We don’t want to antagonize
anyone today.”
AND SO it wont. Perhaps the
underlying spirit of the occasion
was summed up by one little
bearded fellow whose frustrations
welled to the surface in an out
burst of emotion.
“The cold war exists because of
bosses here and in Russia, The
only answer is violent revolution!”
In a word, my visit to Berkeley
was illuminating.

“OH GOD,” moaned a girl, “just
look at that amorphous mass of
dullardus Americanus across the
street waiting for the parade. I
can’t hear to think of the long
years of planning, scheming, and
agitation before we convince them
of the truth. Our victory will not
come easily.”
An impulsive young man said to
his more restrained girl friend,
“This non-violent demonstrating
is okay for the lime being, but in
the future we’ve got to have a
more militant group to ever
spread our influence.

“What I’d like to see would be
the whole lot of us jump in the
middle of the street en masse so
that these Fascist bastards out
there in their SA uniforms
couldn’t goose-step past the re
viewing stand anymore!”
“QUIET, IVAN,” said the girl.
"Please try to contain yourself, at
least for today. We just can’t start
our movement by giving a lot of
uneducated bystanders an unfa
vorable impression of the Student
Peace Union.”

When a VFW poppy seller en
tered the group of demonstrators
one of the organizers spread in
struct ions.

“Now everybody, we’ve all got
to buy poppies when this militar
ist comes by. We’ve got to look as
legitimate and patriotic as pos
sible. We don’t want to antagonize
anyone today.”
AND SO it wont. Perhaps the
underlying spirit of the occasion
was summed up by one little
bearded fellow whose frustrations
welled to the surface in an out
burst of emotion.
“The cold war exists because of
bosses here and in Russia, The
only answer is violent revolution!”
In a word, my visit to Berkeley
was illuminating.
Try mingling in a peace demon
stration sometime. It’s an experi
ence that should be a part of every
one’s liberal education.

I had such an opportunity last
Saturday when I went up to Ber
keley to witness a peace demon
stration sponsored by the Student
Peace Union on the occasion of a
Veterans’ Day parade.
About 100 students displayed
placards such as “Unilateral Ini
tiative,” “Strontium 90, Humanity
0,” “Dinosaurs, All Brawn, No
Brain, Now Extinct,” and "Speak
Softly and Carry a Modest
Bough.”
But in order to probe the real
character of the demonstration it
was necessary to go beneath the
propaganda slogans to find out
what these people were thinking.
ONE UNWASHED female ac
costed me and asked about ISI (In
tercollegiate Society of Individu
alists, a conservative student po
litical organization).
“Oh, that’s one of those semi
secret, neo-fascist groups,” I said
with a humorous tone to my voice.
I waited for a smile to crack on her
face, but it didn’t.
“That’s just wbat I thought,”
she said seriously.
“Would you be the sort of per
son then who would say that all
military men and police are by def
inition fascists?”
“Yes, that’s basically correct,”
she replied.
“WHAT ABOUT General Eisen
hower? Is he a fascist?”
“I think that given certain cir
cumstances Eisenhower could
have acted like a fascist. He has
that kind of mind.”
“What would you call your phi
losophy?”
“I don’t have a philosophy. I
can’t understand all that analyti
cal stuff. I have a psychological
interpretation of things.”
“Then you’re a behaviorist?”
“A behaviorist? What’s that?”
WHILE I was talking with this
creature, a boy of junior high
school age wearing a Student
Peace Union button came up be
hind me, and whenever a unit of
Marines passed, he would give a
Sieg Heil and shout, “There goes

the Wehrmacht!”, or when a con
tingent of young majorettes
marched by, “Look at the Young
Fascist League!”
Meanwhile a friend of mine was
encountering similar experiences
in another part of the crowd.
When a shabbily-dressed man
carrying a sign, “Incineration
I prefer Communism!”, entered
the ranks of the demonstrators,
an organizer of the group named
Bogdan commented, “Well it’s too
bad that the rest of us have to
limit ourselves to carrying these
half-spirited signs and can’t ex
press our true feelings like he is.”
INCIDENTALLY, Bogdan wore
a small red flag in his lapel which
he explained was a symbol of Cas
tro’s July 26 movement.
About this time an executive of
ficer of SLATE who had helped
organize the demonstration mis
took one of us for a dedicated
peace marcher and demanded,
“Why aren’t you people down at
Stanford doing anything? You
seem to think you’re superior to
the rest of us.
"You’ve got to get more strikes,
more demonstrations, more acti
vist speech-making, and propagan
dizing down there if the move
ment is going to gain student sup
port.
“I WILL admit that your vigil
on the library lawn was in the
right direction, but you’ve simply
got to get a more activist attitude
down there!”
(It is understood that local rep
resentatives of the Student Peace
Union will soon try to organize a
Peace Caucus here at Stanford as
a front organization for their
group.)
As the demonstration which be

gan at 8 a.m., dragged into the
mid-morning hours, comments
from the participants became
more frequent and more frustrat
ed.

tingent of young majorettes
marched by, “Look at the Young
Fascist League!”
Meanwhile a friend of mine was
encountering similar experiences
in another part of the crowd.
When a shabbily-dressed man
carrying a sign, “Incineration
I prefer Communism!”, entered
the ranks of the demonstrators,
an organizer of the group named
Bogdan commented, “Well it’s too
bad that the rest of us have to
limit ourselves to carrying these
half-spirited signs and can’t ex
press our true feelings like he is.”
INCIDENTALLY, Bogdan wore
a small red flag in his lapel which
he explained was a symbol of Cas
tro’s July 26 movement.
About this time an executive of
ficer of SLATE who had helped
organize the demonstration mis
took one of us for a dedicated
peace marcher and demanded,
“Why aren’t you people down at
Stanford doing anything? You
seem to think you’re superior to
the rest of us.
"You’ve got to get more strikes,
more demonstrations, more acti
vist speech-making, and propagan
dizing down there if the move
ment is going to gain student sup
port.
“I WILL admit that your vigil
on the library lawn was in the
right direction, but you’ve simply
got to get a more activist attitude
down there!”
(It is understood that local rep
resentatives of the Student Peace
Union will soon try to organize a
Peace Caucus here at Stanford as
a front organization for their
group.)
As the demonstration which be

gan at 8 a.m., dragged into the
mid-morning hours, comments
from the participants became
more frequent and more frustrat
ed.

“OH GOD,” moaned a girl, “just
look at that amorphous mass of
dullardus Americanus across the
street waiting for the parade. I
can’t hear to think of the long
years of planning, scheming, and
agitation before we convince them
of the truth. Our victory will not
come easily.”
An impulsive young man said to
his more restrained girl friend,
“This non-violent demonstrating
is okay for the lime being, but in
the future we’ve got to have a
more militant group to ever
spread our influence.

“What I’d like to see would be
the whole lot of us jump in the
middle of the street en masse so
that these Fascist bastards out
there in their SA uniforms
couldn’t goose-step past the re
viewing stand anymore!”
“QUIET, IVAN,” said the girl.
"Please try to contain yourself, at
least for today. We just can’t start
our movement by giving a lot of
uneducated bystanders an unfa
vorable impression of the Student
Peace Union.”

When a VFW poppy seller en
tered the group of demonstrators
one of the organizers spread in
struct ions.

“Now everybody, we’ve all got
to buy poppies when this militar
ist comes by. We’ve got to look as
legitimate and patriotic as pos
sible. We don’t want to antagonize
anyone today.”
AND SO it wont. Perhaps the
underlying spirit of the occasion
was summed up by one little
bearded fellow whose frustrations
welled to the surface in an out
burst of emotion.
“The cold war exists because of
bosses here and in Russia, The
only answer is violent revolution!”
In a word, my visit to Berkeley
was illuminating.
Try mingling in a peace demon
stration sometime. It’s an experi
ence that should be a part of every
one’s liberal education.

I had such an opportunity last
Saturday when I went up to Ber
keley to witness a peace demon
stration sponsored by the Student
Peace Union on the occasion of a
Veterans’ Day parade.
About 100 students displayed
placards such as “Unilateral Ini
tiative,” “Strontium 90, Humanity
0,” “Dinosaurs, All Brawn, No
Brain, Now Extinct,” and "Speak
Softly and Carry a Modest
Bough.”
But in order to probe the real
character of the demonstration it
was necessary to go beneath the
propaganda slogans to find out
what these people were thinking.
ONE UNWASHED female ac
costed me and asked about ISI (In
tercollegiate Society of Individu
alists, a conservative student po
litical organization).
“Oh, that’s one of those semi
secret, neo-fascist groups,” I said
with a humorous tone to my voice.
I waited for a smile to crack on her
face, but it didn’t.
“That’s just wbat I thought,”
she said seriously.
“Would you be the sort of per
son then who would say that all
military men and police are by def
inition fascists?”
“Yes, that’s basically correct,”
she replied.
“WHAT ABOUT General Eisen
hower? Is he a fascist?”
“I think that given certain cir
cumstances Eisenhower could
have acted like a fascist. He has
that kind of mind.”
“What would you call your phi
losophy?”
“I don’t have a philosophy. I
can’t understand all that analyti
cal stuff. I have a psychological
interpretation of things.”
“Then you’re a behaviorist?”
“A behaviorist? What’s that?”
WHILE I was talking with this
creature, a boy of junior high
school age wearing a Student
Peace Union button came up be
hind me, and whenever a unit of
Marines passed, he would give a
Sieg Heil and shout, “There goes

the Wehrmacht!”, or when a con
tingent of young majorettes
marched by, “Look at the Young
Fascist League!”
