WASHINGTON (UPD—About
one-fourth of the brightest stu
dents in the nation’s high schools
and colleges are wasting their tal
ents.

This was the conclusion reach
ed in a new U.S. Office of Educa
tion (OEEDt study on students
with superior abilities who failed
to make full use of them.
The 15 educators who made the
study deplored abuse of talents
found in the schools and colleges
as a permanent loss to the stu
dents themselves and to the Unit
ed States in its pursuit of excel
lence as a national goal.
THEY AIX agreed that the
problems of students who failed
to make the most of their abilities
could He corrected with proper
guidance at an early age. But they
also said that “group standards
reflecting an anti-intellectual out
look” in American society must be
blamed for the situation.

Dr. Irene Impellizzeri of the New
York City Board of Education,
who headed the team of experts,
said:

“A culture that adores financial
status, physical beauty, second
rate professional entertainment
and the accumulation of material
things, creates an alien world for
brilliant students.”

Boys who fail to make full use
of their abilities outnumber girls
two to one, according to the study.
But male students frequently pull
ahead of their female classmates
in college.
STUDENTS described by the ed
ucators as “underachievers” are
usually more negative in their at
titudes towards themselves and
towards others. They also show
more hostility and suffer from
stronger inferiority feelings than
students whose achievements cor
respond more closely to their tal
ents.
Dr. Impellizzeri said “it is easy
enough to make society at large a

scapegoat for all educational dif
ficulties.” But she said families
set the values for their children
and the schools sometimes distort
educational goals.
