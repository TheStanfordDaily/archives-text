# CURTICE CANCELS PRACTICE
## Ten Men Injured 
### 
Stanford’s usually jovial football coach Cactus Jack Curtice was
not himself at the Northern California Football Writers’ luncheon
held at San Francisco yesterday.
Curtice was glum about 10 injuries to Stanford football players,
none important enough to shelve anyone for the upcoming Wash-

ington State football game, but
numerous enough to cause the
cancellation of yesterday’s foot
ball practice.
HOWEVER there was some
good news awaiting Curtice from
Stanford trainer Connie Jarvis.
Jarvis announced that fullback
Hal Steuber, out with a fractured
jaw since the Michigan State
game, will definitely face Wash
ington State.
The other injuries, such as those
to George Honore, Stan Lindskog,
Frank Patitucci, and Gary Sar
gent are not serious. Thus far,
everyone but Steve Thurlow can
face Washington Stale. The big
sophomore quarterback is still in
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital and
is an unlikely participant in any
more games this year.
Curtice said at the luncheon
that Stanford’s effort against USC
was the Indians’ best offensive
output this year. He cited seven
fumbles and numerous penalties
as the factors that kept Stanford
from capitalizing on their new
found offense.
UNHAPPY as Curtice was, the
Washington State publicity man
showed no lack of enthusiasm. He
was all smiles as he told of the
Cougars’ chances against Stan
ford. It seems that Washington
State has the best end in the coun
try in Hugh Campbell,
Last year Campbell broke two
NCAA pass-receiving records. He
caught 66 passes, breaking a rec
ord previously held by Stanford’s
Chris Burford, and with the passes

junto

he gained 861 yards and scored 10
touchdowns.
He is now a little behind last
year’s totals, but still is far and
away the top pass receiver in the
nation, statistically. He has caught
44 passes for 601 yards and three
touchdowns.
WASHINGTON STATE has an
other fine pass receiver in Pete
Schenck, who has helped ruin
Stanford twice previously.
Passing ace Mel Melin has been
relegated to the Cougar second
string in an effort to gel more va
riety in the attack, and conse
quently the passing efficiency has
decreased. Still the Cougars are
more dangerous than ever with
their new-found rushing attack.
Fullback George Reed scored
three touchdowns on the ground
as the Cougars humbled Oregon
22-21.

HON UALCAGNO, Santa Clara
quarterback, and Bob Martin, San
Francisco State end, were named
back and lineman of the week in
Northern California. Calcagno
passed for two touchdowns and
ran over a two-point conversion in
a 29-28 Bronco victory over the Se
attle Ramblers.

Martin set up the winning Gator
touchdown with a 29-yard pass re
ception against Sacramento State.
San Francisco State won 7-0.

ception against Sacramento State.
San Francisco State won 7-0.
Stanford’s usually jovial football coach Cactus Jack Curtice was
not himself at the Northern California Football Writers’ luncheon
held at San Francisco yesterday.
Curtice was glum about 10 injuries to Stanford football players,
none important enough to shelve anyone for the upcoming Wash-

ington State football game, but
numerous enough to cause the
cancellation of yesterday’s foot
ball practice.
HOWEVER there was some
good news awaiting Curtice from
Stanford trainer Connie Jarvis.
Jarvis announced that fullback
Hal Steuber, out with a fractured
jaw since the Michigan State
game, will definitely face Wash
ington State.
The other injuries, such as those
to George Honore, Stan Lindskog,
Frank Patitucci, and Gary Sar
gent are not serious. Thus far,
everyone but Steve Thurlow can
face Washington Stale. The big
sophomore quarterback is still in
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital and
is an unlikely participant in any
more games this year.
Curtice said at the luncheon
that Stanford’s effort against USC
was the Indians’ best offensive
output this year. He cited seven
fumbles and numerous penalties
as the factors that kept Stanford
from capitalizing on their new
found offense.
UNHAPPY as Curtice was, the
Washington State publicity man
showed no lack of enthusiasm. He
was all smiles as he told of the
Cougars’ chances against Stan
ford. It seems that Washington
State has the best end in the coun
try in Hugh Campbell,
Last year Campbell broke two
NCAA pass-receiving records. He
caught 66 passes, breaking a rec
ord previously held by Stanford’s
Chris Burford, and with the passes

junto

he gained 861 yards and scored 10
touchdowns.
He is now a little behind last
year’s totals, but still is far and
away the top pass receiver in the
nation, statistically. He has caught
44 passes for 601 yards and three
touchdowns.
WASHINGTON STATE has an
other fine pass receiver in Pete
Schenck, who has helped ruin
Stanford twice previously.
Passing ace Mel Melin has been
relegated to the Cougar second
string in an effort to gel more va
riety in the attack, and conse
quently the passing efficiency has
decreased. Still the Cougars are
more dangerous than ever with
their new-found rushing attack.
Fullback George Reed scored
three touchdowns on the ground
as the Cougars humbled Oregon
22-21.

HON UALCAGNO, Santa Clara
quarterback, and Bob Martin, San
Francisco State end, were named
back and lineman of the week in
Northern California. Calcagno
passed for two touchdowns and
ran over a two-point conversion in
a 29-28 Bronco victory over the Se
attle Ramblers.

Martin set up the winning Gator
touchdown with a 29-yard pass re
ception against Sacramento State.
