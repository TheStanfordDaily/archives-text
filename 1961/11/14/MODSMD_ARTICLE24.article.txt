# SAE Shocks Hard-Luck Kappa Sigs On Nelson's Long Touchdown Gallop
## 
### 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, top-rated
intramural football team in Stan
ford University, eked out a thrill
ing 7-0 win over Kappa Sigma yes
terday.
SAE thus finished its season
with five straight wins, while the
Kappa Sigs, the hard-luck team of
the year, ended with a 2-3 season’s
record.
THE FIRST half was scoreless,
with the two tough lines holding
each other to little or no yardage.
The second half was more of the
same. Finally, the SAE’s got to
gether a small drive, with two first
downs coming on the passing of
Craig Nelson, but the Kappa Sigs
toughened at midfield, and forced
a punt.
The snap from center was bad,
and the punter was trapped as he
tried to circle end. Suddenly the
Kappa Sigs had the ball on the
40-yard line, with about seven min
utes left, plenty of time to score.
The Kappa Sigs got a first down
on a Lynn Triplett pass and were
knocking on the door, but the
SAE’s forced Triplett to throw
early and took over on their own
14-yard line, after holding the
Kappa Sigs one yard away from a
first down.
ON THE FIRST play from
scrimmage Nelson ran 66 yards
for the game’s only score. He cir
cled right end, picked up a block
and turned the corner. Twenty
yards downfield he got two key
blocks from his blocking backs
and broke into the open.
He widened his scant two-yard
lead over his pursuer to five yards
when he went over the goal line.
A screen pass from Nelson to
Wayne Samples accounted for the
conversion.
THE KAPPA SIGS weren’t out
of it yet, and they started on their
20-yard line with three minutes
left. Two passes were incomplete,
but Triplett connected with Marty
Abell for 55 yards to the 10-yard
line and a first and goal to go.
Three incomplete passes brought
a fourth and goal situation, but
pass interference gave the Kappa
Sigs first and goal on the one.
With thirty seconds left, Triplett
hit a man in the end zone, but he
caught the ball out of bounds and
the game was over.
In other mural football games,
Rinconada I ground out a 6-0 win
over Soto. A pass interference
penalty set up Rinconada’s only
score, on a one-yard pass from
frosh class president Brooke Tay

lor to Ken Iverson.
The Delt II beat Breakers II
26-6 with a parcel of pass inter
ceptions in the closing minutes,
and Serra II beat AKL II 6-6 on
overtime yardage.
