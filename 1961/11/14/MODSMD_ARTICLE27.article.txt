# Four Stanford Soccer Players Named to All-Conference Team
## 
### 
Four Stanford soccer players
were honored by the Northern
California Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference yesterday, with men
tion on the NCISC all-conference
first and second teams.

The four receiving mention were
inside forward Albert Nnoli,
goalie Hunt Bascom, center for
ward Emmanuel Andah, and de
fensive back Rusty Williams.
NNOLI was named as first team
all - conference forward. Nnoli
capped a great season by scoring
two goals and garnering an assist
against California last Saturday.
He was named by the referees
nearly every Saturday as one of
Stanford’s best players, if not the
best player in the game.
Bascom was given mention as
second team all-conference goalie.
Bascom starred every game he
played, and clinched his selection
in Stanford’s last two conference
games with what would have been
great goal-tending performances
for a healthy man, but were in
credible because of the handicaps
he played under. He faced City
College of San Francisco and Cali
fornia with a broken toe, charley
horse, stiff leg and bad facial cuts
and bruises.
Andah, second team all-confer

ence, was perhaps the fastest man
in the league, and other teams had
to use two men to defense him, be
cause of his great scoring poten
tial. He was used as a decoy most
of this season, but still was a high
scorer.
WILLIAMS, co-captain of the
soccer team, rated second team
consideration by the NCISC
coaches because of his dogged de
fensive work. He was consistently
Stanford’s top defensive perform
er.
League champion CCSF placed
five men on the all-conference
first team. USF, league represent
ative in the NCAA playoffs be
cause of a rule forbidding two
year colleges competing in the
playoffs, had three men named.
Two men from Cal received men
tion. Stanford’s Nnoli completed
the first eleven.

credible because of the handicaps
he played under. He faced City
College of San Francisco and Cali
fornia with a broken toe, charley
horse, stiff leg and bad facial cuts
and bruises.
Andah, second team all-confer

ence, was perhaps the fastest man
in the league, and other teams had
to use two men to defense him, be
cause of his great scoring poten
tial. He was used as a decoy most
of this season, but still was a high
scorer.
WILLIAMS, co-captain of the
soccer team, rated second team
consideration by the NCISC
coaches because of his dogged de
fensive work. He was consistently
Stanford’s top defensive perform
er.
League champion CCSF placed
five men on the all-conference
first team. USF, league represent
ative in the NCAA playoffs be
cause of a rule forbidding two
year colleges competing in the
playoffs, had three men named.
Two men from Cal received men
tion. Stanford’s Nnoli completed
the first eleven.


ALL-CONFERENCE SOCCER PLAYERS from Stanford named by the
NCISC Coaches yesterday include from left to right Emmanuel An
dah, Albert Nnoli and Hunt Bascom.
