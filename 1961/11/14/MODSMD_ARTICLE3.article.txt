# Big Alumni Parley Set In Capital
## 
### 
A Stanford Alumni Conference
will be held this spring in Wash
ington, D.C., for the first time, ac
cording to Julie Hirsch. student
alumni coordinator for the Stan
ford Alumni Association.

“The size and interest of the
Stanford contingent in the capital
caused the association to expand
its program to Washington,” Miss
Hirsch said. “There is a possibility
that an embassy reception may be
arranged,” she added.

PROMINENT Stanford alumni
in Washington will receive invita
tions to the conference, she said.
These include Sens. Carl Hayden
of Arizona, Frank Church of Ida
ho, Lee Metcalf of Montana and
Henry Jackson of Washington.
Others are Representatives
Charles Teague of California and
Edith Green of Oregon, presiden
tial staffer Fred Dutton, Under
secretary of the Navy Paul Fay,
Najeeb Halaby of the Federal
Aviation Agency, Assistant Attor
ney General William Orrick, Jr.,
Assistant Secretary of Agricul
ture James T. Ralph, Eunice Ken
nedy Shriver, wife of Peace Corps
director Sargent Shriver and sis
ter to the President, and author
Allen Drury.

ADDITION OF Washington,
D.C., to the conference itinerary
brings the number of conferences
presented annually by the Univer
sity, the Alumni Association and
local Stanford Clubs across the
nation to 16, Miss Hirsch said.

The national prominence of the
Stanford Conference program was
pointed out by Director of Univer
sity Relations Lyle Nelson recent
ly as he spoke to a group of local
conference chairmen. “This pro
gram is well known nationally and
is regarded as about the finest of
its kind in the field of alumni as
sociation activities,” he said.
NELSON SAID he knew of the
Stanford program before coming
to the Farm from the University
of Michigan.
“Administrations and faculties
across the country see in the Stan
ford Association’s program a mod
el in its field in its concentration
on the academic rather than the
social and athletic aspects of alum
ni interests.
