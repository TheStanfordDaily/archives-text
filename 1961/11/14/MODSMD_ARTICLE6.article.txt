# ARSON SUSPECTED
## New LA Brush Fire Rages Out of Control 
### 
. LOS ANGELES (UPH-- A wind
fed brush fire—possibly the work
of an arsonist—burned out of con
trol Monday night in a canyon
area of the foothills of Angeles
National Forest, destroying or
damaging at least 10 homos and
other buildings.
At least 2,800 acres of brush
were burned over by the fire, al
ready blamed for three injuries.
Hundreds of persons were evac
uated.
COUNTY FIRE CHIEF Keith
Klinger called it “a serious situa
tion” although a shift in winds
eased the immediate threat to
more than 150 homes in Kagel
Canyon which were evacuated
Monday afternoon. The fire was
completely unchecked in a rough
area along its eastern front where
firemen hoped to dig in at Eby
Canyon before today’s anticipated
high winds.
Extreme winds—of the type that
caused extensive difficulty in
fighting last Monday’s Topanga
and Bel Air fires—are forecast for
today.

HUNDREDS of persons were
evacuated Monday afternoon, al
most 100 of whom were fed and

housed at a Red Cross fire center
at Charles Maclay junior high
school.
Two men at first were listed as
seriously injured. However, a
later report listed three minor in
juries, to a Capt. Snow, and fire
men Harry Lang and Terry Malay,
all of San Fernando.
