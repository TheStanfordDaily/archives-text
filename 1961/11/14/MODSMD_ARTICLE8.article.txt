# Hot Fires and Wild Burros Don't Mix
## 
### 
Hot fires and wild burros don’t mix, and that’s one of the
reasons Stanford finished last in the cross country races last
weekend.
At least that’s the explanation of Benson Fogle, the stal
wart last-place Stanford runner.
Fogle, a Stanford Research Institute physicist, finished
last in the World’s Championship Cross-Country Wild Burro
Race and the Flapjack Contest, in Death Valley over the
weekend.
The object of the flapjack race was to take a wild burro,
pack him with prospector’s gear, race around the field with
him, unpack the gear, make a flapjack on a fire, and have the
burro eat it.
Fogle’s burro wasn’t hungry, and he didn’t like the fire
either.
-Wt least the fierce, four-legged fighter wouldn’t got near
the fire.
“I grabbed him by the tail and dragged him, but he fell
down,” Fogle complained. “Then when the fire got hot ho hee
hawed. We finished the flapjack 10 minutes later than anyone
else.”
Fogle took 12 hours and 10 minutes spread over three
days to coax and drag his burro over 46 miles of desert from
Beatty, Nev., to Stove Pipe Wells, Death Valley, in the cross
country part of the races.
The winner of the race. Don Wilson from Apple Valley,
did it in only six hours and 40 minutes.
But Wilson, declared an embittered Fogle, is a cross
country runner and a veterinary student. In addition to that,
Fogle explained, the burros weighed 400 to 500 pounds rather
than the 150 pounds he expected.
“I wasn’t in shape to handle such beasts,” Fogle said, “and
I was kicked three times and bitten twice.”
The races were part of Death Valley Days, an annual
celebration in the valley, and Fogle is thinking of entering
again next year, but he may begin practicing earlier.
After all, he said, finishing last wasn't too had. Of 59 who
entered the race only 16 finished at all.

But Wilson, declared an embittered Fogle, is a cross
country runner and a veterinary student. In addition to that,
Fogle explained, the burros weighed 400 to 500 pounds rather
than the 150 pounds he expected.
“I wasn’t in shape to handle such beasts,” Fogle said, “and
I was kicked three times and bitten twice.”
The races were part of Death Valley Days, an annual
celebration in the valley, and Fogle is thinking of entering
again next year, but he may begin practicing earlier.
After all, he said, finishing last wasn't too had. Of 59 who
entered the race only 16 finished at all.
