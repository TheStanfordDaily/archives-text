# Humanism Demands Accord With God, Says Canon Green
## 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
“To be right with God is the* most important tiling lor man. This
is true humanism.”
This definition of man’s function was presented hy Canon Bryan
Green in the first of his four-lecture series last night at Memorial
Church.

Presenting a seven-point defini
tion of basic Christianity, Canon
Green told his audience that:

1. Christianity maintains a be
lief that God made and sustains
the world. This Supreme Being is
different from his creations.
2. He is different from, but not
indifferent to his creations. He
loves them.
3. The created order is out of
harmony with the purpose of the
Creator.
4. This is because of man’s re
fusal to acknowledge God and,
hence, his inability to enjoy com
munion with God.

5. God is actively seeking to
overcome this separation. This
seeking is the inner meaning of
history,
6. The search is seen in Jesus
Christ.

7. This continuing and dynamic
relation to history is the presence
of Christ at once both revealed and
obscured by the Church.
“Christianity is really grounded
in the earth,” Canon Green said.
“You can’t be a Christian without
being a humanist.”
CHRISTIAN HUMANISM is in
opposition to atheistic (without
God) humanism, which regai'ds
man as a “temporary entity, a fab
ricated thing.” The Christian man
has “something of eternal value
in an unique way. Atheistic hu
manism is similar to communism
and Buddhism.
All advocate a return to “the
pan god of nature, where man an
swers to himself and to none
other.” Canon Green warned that
the “totalitarian state is only au
tonomous man writ large.”
He noted that the Church seems
to be unaware of the pervading
humanistic attitude with which it
should be wrestling and called for
a Christian scholar to give the
Christian apology in its true sense
of atheistic humanism.
NOTING THE wide presence of
this atheistic humanism, Green
stated, “Many students at Stan
ford are conscious or more often
unconscious atheistic humanists.
God is a second phenomenon.”
Yet, Green asserted that man’s
lignity is that he is a child of God.
The atheist says that man simply
needs more wisdom to end the
economic, physical, and mental
disorder which exists today, but
Green denied this.
“Can disorder today be because
man is a guilty sinner out of a
proper personal relationship to
God?” Green asked. “Is the truth
that man’s trouble is the sin of
godlessness, that he has repudi
ated his natural position in the or
der of things?”
“GOD IS A POWER greater
than which it is not possible to
perceive,” Green noted. “I can con
ceive of the creative mind as
greater than impersonal force.”
It is this creative mind which
Green sees behind, beyond, and yet
within the evolutionary process of
developing life.
Green sees the purpose of living
for the Christian as cooperation
with God's creative mind. “I am
realizing my self as a proper
man,” he asserted, “when I am
right with God.”
Yet. man’s sin and predicament
today is that he denies his spiritu
al nature. When we deny our
fatherhood with God, we deny our
common brotherhood with man.”
“If you think God is God, then
follow him. Remember it’s got to
he an absolute commitment.”
