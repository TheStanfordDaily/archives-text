SOMEONE AT STANFORD
WILL WIN-LIKE YOU?
Here’s the story, man. This swinging
Sprite will go to some guy or gal right
here on campus. All other colleges are
like in Outsville. Get the picture, get
the odds? This is one deal you’ve got to
get in on.
First thing to do, get your hands on a
Registration Envelope, which gives you
the easy Giveaway Rules. You’ll find
Registration Envelopes everyivhere
all around campus and in your local
smoke shops. Our Liggett & Myers
Campus Rep has stacks of them, too
you’ll catch him making the scene in
his Grand Prix Sprite, just like the one
you’ll maybe win.
Next, you take a little quiz. It’s printed
right on the envelope, see, it’s about
sports cars and you can do it in like 47
seconds. Then smoke 5 wonderful packs
of Chesterfields or L&M’s (or, if you're
a menthol man, Oasis), tear the bottom
panels of all 5 packs, tuck them in the
envelope, sign your name and mail it.
Or you can send substitutes (see rules).
Got it?
Now comes the pay-off I If you pass the
quiz you’ll receive in the mail a Grand
Prix License Plate. It’s serialized. Hang
on to it, because this is it! Your serial
number may be the one the electronic
brain selects ... that might put you like
behind the wheel of that jazzy Sprite!
Enter incessantly! The more Grand
Prix License Plates you collect, the bet
ter your odds will be. Entries accepted
till April 1, 1962 the winner will be
announced on or about May 1,1962; so
stay with it! Keep smoking those won
derful Chesterfield, L&M or Oasis cig
arettes (or drawing those substitutes
if you want to be a square). Keep try
ing! Win, man!
So go! Get started! There’s going to be
a new ’62 Sprite on campus soon and
you might as well jingle the keys to it
in your jeans ... right?

like in Outsville. Get the picture, get
the odds? This is one deal you’ve got to
get in on.
First thing to do, get your hands on a
Registration Envelope, which gives you
the easy Giveaway Rules. You’ll find
Registration Envelopes everyivhere
all around campus and in your local
smoke shops. Our Liggett & Myers
Campus Rep has stacks of them, too
you’ll catch him making the scene in
his Grand Prix Sprite, just like the one
you’ll maybe win.
Next, you take a little quiz. It’s printed
right on the envelope, see, it’s about
sports cars and you can do it in like 47
seconds. Then smoke 5 wonderful packs
of Chesterfields or L&M’s (or, if you're
a menthol man, Oasis), tear the bottom
panels of all 5 packs, tuck them in the
envelope, sign your name and mail it.
Or you can send substitutes (see rules).
Got it?
Now comes the pay-off I If you pass the
quiz you’ll receive in the mail a Grand
Prix License Plate. It’s serialized. Hang
on to it, because this is it! Your serial
number may be the one the electronic
brain selects ... that might put you like
behind the wheel of that jazzy Sprite!
Enter incessantly! The more Grand
Prix License Plates you collect, the bet
ter your odds will be. Entries accepted
till April 1, 1962 the winner will be
announced on or about May 1,1962; so
stay with it! Keep smoking those won
derful Chesterfield, L&M or Oasis cig
arettes (or drawing those substitutes
if you want to be a square). Keep try
ing! Win, man!
So go! Get started! There’s going to be
a new ’62 Sprite on campus soon and
you might as well jingle the keys to it
in your jeans ... right?
