# 'Christ Both Man, God,' Says Green

### VIVI BOZMAN 
“Christ is both man utterly human and truly God,” Canon Bryan
Green told his audience last night in his lecture on the inner mean
ing of history, the second of his series of four lectures on Chris
tianity.
Through Christ God expressed Himself within the* very human-

ity of man. This is both tho Chris-"
tian faith and tho uniqueness of
Christ.
GREEN’S definition of Christ
stemmed from two points of the
doctrine of Christianity which he
presented in his first lecture. God
is actively seeking to overcome the
separation between Himself and
man; this is the inner meaning of
history. This search is uniquely
focused in the person and event
called Jesus Christ.
It is logical to find God, a supra
personality, revealing Himself in
the physical world He created and
in history, for it is part of the na
ture of personality to be self-re
vealing.
“God’s patient self-disclosure
and man’s fateful discovery, is
this what we mean by religious ex
perience?” Canon Green asked.
CHRISTIANITY believes that
God has been disclosing Himself
throughout history. The majestic
words of the Hebrew prophets
said that they had discovered a
God, a sovereign Creator, who
would be realized in a climax.
Christianity says that the event
in history called Jesus Christ is
this climax. Through Christ God
translated Himself into the lan
guage of human life that man can
understand. Christ is “the unique
focus for God’s activity of using
history to bring man back to Him
self.’’

“What finer act of humility has
tho world ever seen than when the
infinite God presents himself to
you for acceptance? This is the
startling, amazing fact of Chris
tian gospel.”

“I STAND here not as Bryan
Green, but in the name of the
Christian Church, in a line of 2,000
years with every single Christian.”
The classic phrases of the gospel
give the identity of Christ as “God
made flesh,” “incarnated.” The
writers of the new Testament see
Christ as dynamic, revolutionary
in his teachings and actions, and
concerned for people’s bodies,
feeding and healing them.”

Christ is unique because Ho is
God expressed within the very hu
manity of his creations and be
cause the story of the divine being
dying for love of sinful man is
unique in histoi’y. Green asserted
that Christ as a major influence
cannot be avoided, “no matter
what the western civilization
books say.”
When an honest man finds he
cannot avoid Christ, he must
either accept Christ as God or as
self-deluded and self-deceived.
Whichever choice he makes, he
must live by his decision.
“What shall we do with the
event of Jesus Christ?” Canon
Green asked. “If you do accept
Him. let Him be the sovereign
Lord God of your life; He must bo
God to you. Christ will never save
you or guide you until He is your
Lord.”
