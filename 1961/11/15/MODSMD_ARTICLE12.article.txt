# Peace Challenge—Cornell to Stanford
## 
### 
Faculty members at Cornell University have issued a call to the
academic community which we hope will not go unheeded at Stan
ford. The following letter explains the matter:
“We feel that the threat of global war, the effects of nuclear
testing, and the attitude of helplessness in the face of these perils
are subjects of the utmost importance. To demonstrate our concern
we shall suspend our normal academic activities on Nov. 17 and
devote the day to discussion of these subjects.
“We believe that it is appropriate for the academic community
to express its anxiety. Civilization is in danger. The method of
rational discourse which we are committed to has been too long
absent from the discussion of international problems. Our con
science dictates that, as part of our teaching obligation, we raise
these issues as forcefully as we can.
“At Cornell we shall announce to our students that instead of
holding normal classes on Nov. 17 we shall devote class time to a
discussion of global war and nuclear testing. In the afternoon we
shall join in a mass meeting of students and faculty to state our
convictions and to urge others to state theirs.
“We are sending this letter to all our friends in the profession,
and we are asking them, in turn, to make copies for their friends.
We hope that every college and university will participate.” [ltalics
ours.]
It is signed by Anthony Caputi, Paul de Man, Angus Fletcher,
Allan Goldstein, Carl Herz, Peter Kahn, Walter Slatoff, Hal Smith,
Taylor Stoehr and “other facidty members,” reported to make up a
large majority of the Cornell faculty.
We feel this appeal deserves the support of all students and
faculty at Stanford. We would like nothing better than to see class
room discussion Friday used to examine these issues, followed by a
mass meeting in the afternoon at Frost or on the library lawn.
Certainly there are many Stanford professors and students who
would back such a move. The question is can such a meeting be
organized at short notice and would Stanford professors be willing
to demonstrate their concern in such a public manner?
There is no question that abandoning regular classwork for a
day to discuss such matters is valuable, for if such matters are not
settled soon, there will not be future classes for faculty to teach
er faculty to teach them.

In reading the Cornell letter, one must admire and respect the
faculty members who are participating in the demonstration of their
awareness over “the threat of global war, the effects of nuclear test
ing, and the attitude of helplessness.” These men obviously feel a
deep concern over the drift of world affairs and are in a mood to
show it as individuals.

And their public show of this concern cannot be labeled as a
“subversive plot” or so on without labeling the entire school. By
their actions, these professors and students will actually be repre
senting more patriotism toward their country and humanity than
the lunatic rightists who pass themselves off as “patriots” ever can.
Again, we express a fervent hope that Stanford will participate
in such a demonstration, for if the academic community and leaders
do not speak out now—loudly, publicly and with force—the future
is dim indeed.
