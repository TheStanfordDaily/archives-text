## San Jose, Cal Offer Two Views on Grades 
### CARL OLIVER Exchange Editor 
People just can’t seem to de
cide whether it’s better to “A” a
course or flunk it. Consider these
two current nows stories:
San Jose—A plan to raise the
grade averages of freshman wom
en students has been unveiled at
San Jose State College.
Berkeley—After six years of
study, a University of California
research team concluded that
many of America’s most highly
creative men don’t have a history
of high grades.
SAN JOSE—Eighty coeds liv
ing at Wendy Glen I residence
hall are eligible for a “Scholastic
Plan” which rewards them with
low room and board rates for high
grades during the year.
Berkeley According to the
committee, many of the nation’s
top creative men couldn’t get into
most graduate schools
San Jose—Each rise in the stu
dent’s grade average earns her a
higher rent refund at the end of
the semester. The higher the
GPA, the lower the rent.
Berkeley—Dr. Donald W. Mac-
Kinnon, director of the universi
ty’s Institute of Personality As
sessment and Research, headed
the six-year study of 530 archi
tects, writers, industrial research
scientists, mathematicians and
college students.
SAN JOSE Women on the

plan pay $430 rent at the begin
ning of the semester. A GPA of
.99 or lower (an “F”) eliminates
them from any refund,
Berkeley—The biggest surprise
came in the area of the value of
“intelligence,” said MacKinnon.
San Jose—lf the coed earns a
4.0 ("A”) during the semester,
she gets $l2O of her room and
board fees refunded.

Berkeley—“ There seems to be
no relation between the degree of
intelligence that exists and a per
son’s creativity,” MacKinnon said.
“A certain amount of intelligence
is apparently necessary for cre
ativity, but above that it doesn’t
make much difference.”

SAN JOSE—Wendy Glen I is
operated by a private landlord,
Glen A. Skillrud. “The purpose
of the plan,” he says, “is to help
the below average student help
herself. It should give her incen
tiive to work harder for grades.”
Berkeley—“lt’s certainly true,”
MacKinnon said, “that our most
creative subjects haven’t been
grade-getters. The architects have
ranged around B averages; the
research scientists B to C. They’re
certainly not the A boys.”
San Jose—Skillrud says he ex
pects the girls on the Scholastic
Plan to average 1.6 points higher
than the general all-school aver
age of 2.0.
Berkeley—MacKinnon said the
minimum IQ of those tested was
above 120.
