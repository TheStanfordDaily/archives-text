WASHINGTON (UPD— Presi
dent Kennedy promised South
Korean leader Gen. Chung Hee
Park yesterday that U.S. military
forces would be used again if
necessary to preserve the repub
lic’s freedom.
The pledge was contained in a
communique issued following an
afternoon of meetings between
Kennedy and the 44-year-old gen
eral who led a military coup in
his country last May.
KENNEDY “reaffirmed the de
termination of the United States
to render forthwith and effec
tively all possible assistance to
the republic of Korea,” the com
munique said.
This, Kennedy said, included
“the use of armed forces if there
is a renewal of armed attack.”
The communique said Park and
the President discussed the prob
lem of mutual defense against
the threat of external armed ag
gression in the Pacific area.
“They recognized that the com
mon interest of their two coun
tries as bulwarks of the free
world against Communist expan
sion is deepened and reinforced
by the fact that the Korean and
United States troops are brothers
in-arms, standing side by side in
the United Nations command for
the defense of Korean soil,” the
communique said.
THE TWO men also rejected
the use of force to unify Korea.
They said they “reaffirmed their
faith in the United Nations and
their determination to seek the
unification of Korea in freedom
through peaceful means under
the principles laid down and re
affirmed by the United Nations
General Assembly.”
