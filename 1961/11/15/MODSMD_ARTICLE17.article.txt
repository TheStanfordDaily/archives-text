## Unilateral Disarmament May Be Best Course tor America 
### RANDY GALLISTEL 
The trouble with most argu
ments for unilateral disarmament
is that they rest on moral concerns
for the good of humanity. Morali
ty is a pleasant luxury, but, unfor
tunately, no nation can afford to
indulge in it while pursuing inter
national policy.
Nevertheless, unilateral disar
mament, with certain modifica
tions, may well be the most ration
al policy, if we define the most ra
tional policy as that policy which
stands the best chance of preserv
ing for us and our progeny what
we loosely term “the American
way of life.”

Simple unilateral disarmament
has one big disadvantage —it
leaves us totally defenseless
against foreign imperialists. We
can modify this by preparing our
selves in advance for guerrilla
warfare. Such preparation would
involve training the entire male
population in the guerrilla tactics
best suited to their local terrain.
In addition, we would stockpile
hundreds of thousands of small
arms, automatic rifles, grenades,
explosives, etc. in thousands of
hidden caches throughout the U.S.

SUCH A DEFENSE would make
us easy to invade but impossible
to subdue. The French, witli one
of the best trained and equipped
armies in the world, have found it
impossible to subdue the Algeri
ans. And the Algerian guerrilla
revolution was organized from
scratch in the midst of an already
existent tyranny. Nor have the
French failed because of unwill
ingness to stoop to the most brutal
and inhumane methods of sup
pression. The Algerian repression
has often been extremely brutal.
Theoretically, the Russians
could decide to exterminate us
atomically. However, this seems
most unlikely for a number of rea
sons, the least of which is the
quite credible assumption that the
Russians, terrible though they
may well be, are not such complete
ogres as that.
First, they would run the con
siderable risk of poisoning the
rest of the world’s population,
their own included. Second, the
Russians want to rule the rest of
the world, not exterminate it.
Should they ruthlessly extermi
nate us, they would engender so
much hate and fear in the other
countries of the world, that the

only way to subdue them would be
to exterminate them likewise.
I THINK WE can credit Khrush
chov with enough intelligence to
see the overwhelming disadvan
tages of such a policy as world ex
termination. After all, a tyrant
needs someone to tyrannize.

So. it seems the worst that could
happen would be a Russian inva
sion. Inevitably, it would fail.
The Russians might destroy a
good many of our cities and much
of our industry. But even in this
worst of all likely events, we
would still have something left
from which to build anew our way
of life.
Of course, we have to reckon
with the effect unilateral disarma
ment might have on our allies. Our
allies in North America, Western
Europe, and Australia would have
little choice but to follow suit.

NO ONE, with the exception of
Charles de Gaulle, is so naive as to
think that the free world is capa
ble of opposing Russia in atomic
or conventional warfare without
the United States. Even with the
United States, it is touch and go.
To ally themselves with Russia
while she subdued us would be
short sighted, to say the least,
since they would surely be next on
the list. The only means of protec
tion left would be to make them
selves as unpalatable a morsel as
possible by training their men to
fight guerrilla warfare. Such a de
fense should considerably de
crease the likelihood of a Russian
invasion.

There ought, therefore, to be a
decent chance of preserving the
free and industrialized nations.
Some of the underdeveloped areas
may very well temporarily suc
cumb to Russian or Chinese con
trol. But, what of it? The “free
dom” of these countries is impor
tant to us now because of their
strategic value in our present pol
icy.

IN THE policy proposed here,
they would have little strategic
value. Even their economic value
cannot make or break our own
economy. Most of these nations
will undoubtedly soon shake off
the yoke of Russian domination
anyway. Having just got rid of one
set of foreign oppressors, they
won’t welcome a second set.
They’ve learned to prefer the do
mestic breed of oppressors.
Granted the possibility that
Russia may invade us and other
countries, how likely is it? Not
very. With the United States no
longer a military power, Russia
should soon have her hands full
elsewhere. At present; a common
cause opposition to the U.S.
holds Russia and China together.
The bonds of Sino-Soviet friend
ship probably wouldn't survive
the death of this common cause
by more than a few months.
Two big unopposed world pow
ers seldom coexist amicably. Rus
sia and China are already at odds
on many issues. Given their ag
gressive foreign policies, their dif
ferences should become more pro
nounced, especially if we help
China break her dependence on
Russia.

WHAT, THEN, is the worst pos
sible outcome of our present poli
cy? Obviously, nuclear war. The
potential horrors of nuclear war
need no elaboration here. Suffice
it to say that the American way of
life would be totally destroyed,
and it could not be rebuilt within
the foreseeable future, if, indeed,
life itself could over fully recover.
Is such a disaster a likely out
come of our present policy? It
would seem an almost inevitable
one. That the present nuclear stale
mate should continue indefinitely
is unimaginable. Yet, how else can
we terminate the status quo save
through nuclear war? What
chance is there of a negotiated set
tlement?

The cold war began in earnest
13 years ago. Russia and the U.S.
are farther from peace now than
at any other time. Russia tests 50-
megaton bombs and the U.S.
builds up her military strength in
Western Europe. Mistrust and
hale grow stronger every day, yet.
a real negotiated peace presup
poses mutual trust.

HOW MUCH longer can we con
tinue the game of brinkmanship?
How many more situations like
Berlin can pass before both coun
tries commit themselves to posi
tions from w'hich they can no long
er negotiate?

When we stack the policies up
against one another, the possible
consequences of present policy ap
pear much worse; their likelihood
much greater. To the intelligent
gambler, unilateral disarmament
would seem much the hotter bet.
Unfortunately, very few people
gamble intelligently.

13 years ago. Russia and the U.S.
are farther from peace now than
at any other time. Russia tests 50-
megaton bombs and the U.S.
builds up her military strength in
Western Europe. Mistrust and

a real negotiated peace presup
poses mutual trust.

HOW MUCH longer can we con
tinue the game of brinkmanship?
How many more situations like
Berlin can pass before both coun
tries commit themselves to posi
tions from w'hich they can no long
er negotiate?

When we stack the policies up
against one another, the possible
consequences of present policy ap
pear much worse; their likelihood
much greater. To the intelligent
gambler, unilateral disarmament
would seem much the hotter bet.
Unfortunately, very few people
gamble intelligently.
The trouble with most argu
ments for unilateral disarmament
is that they rest on moral concerns
for the good of humanity. Morali
ty is a pleasant luxury, but, unfor
tunately, no nation can afford to
indulge in it while pursuing inter
national policy.
Nevertheless, unilateral disar
mament, with certain modifica
tions, may well be the most ration
al policy, if we define the most ra
tional policy as that policy which
stands the best chance of preserv
ing for us and our progeny what
we loosely term “the American
way of life.”

Simple unilateral disarmament
has one big disadvantage —it
leaves us totally defenseless
against foreign imperialists. We
can modify this by preparing our
selves in advance for guerrilla
warfare. Such preparation would
involve training the entire male
population in the guerrilla tactics
best suited to their local terrain.
In addition, we would stockpile
hundreds of thousands of small
arms, automatic rifles, grenades,
explosives, etc. in thousands of
hidden caches throughout the U.S.

SUCH A DEFENSE would make
us easy to invade but impossible
to subdue. The French, witli one
of the best trained and equipped
armies in the world, have found it
impossible to subdue the Algeri
ans. And the Algerian guerrilla
revolution was organized from
scratch in the midst of an already
existent tyranny. Nor have the
French failed because of unwill
ingness to stoop to the most brutal
and inhumane methods of sup
pression. The Algerian repression
has often been extremely brutal.
Theoretically, the Russians
could decide to exterminate us
atomically. However, this seems
most unlikely for a number of rea
sons, the least of which is the
quite credible assumption that the
Russians, terrible though they
may well be, are not such complete
ogres as that.
First, they would run the con
siderable risk of poisoning the
rest of the world’s population,
their own included. Second, the
Russians want to rule the rest of
the world, not exterminate it.
Should they ruthlessly extermi
nate us, they would engender so
much hate and fear in the other
countries of the world, that the

only way to subdue them would be
to exterminate them likewise.
I THINK WE can credit Khrush
chov with enough intelligence to
see the overwhelming disadvan
tages of such a policy as world ex
termination. After all, a tyrant
needs someone to tyrannize.

So. it seems the worst that could
happen would be a Russian inva
sion. Inevitably, it would fail.
The Russians might destroy a
good many of our cities and much
of our industry. But even in this
worst of all likely events, we
would still have something left
from which to build anew our way
of life.
Of course, we have to reckon
with the effect unilateral disarma
ment might have on our allies. Our
allies in North America, Western
Europe, and Australia would have
little choice but to follow suit.

NO ONE, with the exception of
Charles de Gaulle, is so naive as to
think that the free world is capa
ble of opposing Russia in atomic
or conventional warfare without
the United States. Even with the
United States, it is touch and go.
To ally themselves with Russia
while she subdued us would be
short sighted, to say the least,
since they would surely be next on
the list. The only means of protec
tion left would be to make them
selves as unpalatable a morsel as
possible by training their men to
fight guerrilla warfare. Such a de
fense should considerably de
crease the likelihood of a Russian
invasion.

There ought, therefore, to be a
decent chance of preserving the
free and industrialized nations.
Some of the underdeveloped areas
may very well temporarily suc
cumb to Russian or Chinese con
trol. But, what of it? The “free
dom” of these countries is impor
tant to us now because of their
strategic value in our present pol
icy.

IN THE policy proposed here,
they would have little strategic
value. Even their economic value
cannot make or break our own
economy. Most of these nations
will undoubtedly soon shake off
the yoke of Russian domination
anyway. Having just got rid of one
set of foreign oppressors, they
won’t welcome a second set.
They’ve learned to prefer the do
mestic breed of oppressors.
Granted the possibility that
Russia may invade us and other
countries, how likely is it? Not
very. With the United States no
longer a military power, Russia
should soon have her hands full
elsewhere. At present; a common
cause opposition to the U.S.
holds Russia and China together.
The bonds of Sino-Soviet friend
ship probably wouldn't survive
the death of this common cause
by more than a few months.
Two big unopposed world pow
ers seldom coexist amicably. Rus
sia and China are already at odds
on many issues. Given their ag
gressive foreign policies, their dif
ferences should become more pro
nounced, especially if we help
China break her dependence on
Russia.

WHAT, THEN, is the worst pos
sible outcome of our present poli
cy? Obviously, nuclear war. The
potential horrors of nuclear war
need no elaboration here. Suffice
it to say that the American way of
life would be totally destroyed,
and it could not be rebuilt within
the foreseeable future, if, indeed,
life itself could over fully recover.
Is such a disaster a likely out
come of our present policy? It
would seem an almost inevitable
one. That the present nuclear stale
mate should continue indefinitely
is unimaginable. Yet, how else can
we terminate the status quo save
through nuclear war? What
chance is there of a negotiated set
tlement?

China break her dependence on
Russia.

WHAT, THEN, is the worst pos
sible outcome of our present poli
cy? Obviously, nuclear war. The
potential horrors of nuclear war
need no elaboration here. Suffice
it to say that the American way of
life would be totally destroyed,
and it could not be rebuilt within
the foreseeable future, if, indeed,
life itself could over fully recover.
Is such a disaster a likely out
come of our present policy? It
would seem an almost inevitable
one. That the present nuclear stale
mate should continue indefinitely
is unimaginable. Yet, how else can
we terminate the status quo save
through nuclear war? What
chance is there of a negotiated set
tlement?

The cold war began in earnest
13 years ago. Russia and the U.S.
are farther from peace now than
at any other time. Russia tests 50-
megaton bombs and the U.S.
builds up her military strength in
Western Europe. Mistrust and
hale grow stronger every day, yet.
a real negotiated peace presup
poses mutual trust.

HOW MUCH longer can we con
tinue the game of brinkmanship?
How many more situations like
Berlin can pass before both coun
tries commit themselves to posi
tions from w'hich they can no long
er negotiate?

When we stack the policies up
against one another, the possible
consequences of present policy ap
pear much worse; their likelihood
much greater. To the intelligent
gambler, unilateral disarmament
would seem much the hotter bet.
Unfortunately, very few people
gamble intelligently.
The trouble with most argu
ments for unilateral disarmament
is that they rest on moral concerns
for the good of humanity. Morali
ty is a pleasant luxury, but, unfor
tunately, no nation can afford to
indulge in it while pursuing inter
national policy.
Nevertheless, unilateral disar
mament, with certain modifica
tions, may well be the most ration
al policy, if we define the most ra
tional policy as that policy which
stands the best chance of preserv
ing for us and our progeny what
we loosely term “the American
way of life.”

Simple unilateral disarmament
has one big disadvantage —it
leaves us totally defenseless
against foreign imperialists. We
can modify this by preparing our
selves in advance for guerrilla
warfare. Such preparation would
involve training the entire male
population in the guerrilla tactics
best suited to their local terrain.
In addition, we would stockpile
hundreds of thousands of small
arms, automatic rifles, grenades,
explosives, etc. in thousands of
hidden caches throughout the U.S.

SUCH A DEFENSE would make
us easy to invade but impossible
to subdue. The French, witli one
of the best trained and equipped
armies in the world, have found it
impossible to subdue the Algeri
ans. And the Algerian guerrilla
revolution was organized from
scratch in the midst of an already
existent tyranny. Nor have the
French failed because of unwill
ingness to stoop to the most brutal
and inhumane methods of sup
pression. The Algerian repression
has often been extremely brutal.
Theoretically, the Russians
could decide to exterminate us
atomically. However, this seems
most unlikely for a number of rea
sons, the least of which is the
quite credible assumption that the
Russians, terrible though they
may well be, are not such complete
ogres as that.
First, they would run the con
siderable risk of poisoning the
rest of the world’s population,
their own included. Second, the
Russians want to rule the rest of
the world, not exterminate it.
Should they ruthlessly extermi
nate us, they would engender so
much hate and fear in the other
countries of the world, that the

only way to subdue them would be
to exterminate them likewise.
I THINK WE can credit Khrush
chov with enough intelligence to
see the overwhelming disadvan
tages of such a policy as world ex
termination. After all, a tyrant
needs someone to tyrannize.

So. it seems the worst that could
happen would be a Russian inva
sion. Inevitably, it would fail.
The Russians might destroy a
good many of our cities and much
of our industry. But even in this
worst of all likely events, we
would still have something left
from which to build anew our way
of life.
Of course, we have to reckon
with the effect unilateral disarma
ment might have on our allies. Our
allies in North America, Western
Europe, and Australia would have
little choice but to follow suit.

NO ONE, with the exception of
Charles de Gaulle, is so naive as to
think that the free world is capa
ble of opposing Russia in atomic
or conventional warfare without
the United States. Even with the
United States, it is touch and go.
To ally themselves with Russia
while she subdued us would be
short sighted, to say the least,
since they would surely be next on
the list. The only means of protec
tion left would be to make them
selves as unpalatable a morsel as
possible by training their men to
fight guerrilla warfare. Such a de
fense should considerably de
crease the likelihood of a Russian
invasion.

There ought, therefore, to be a
decent chance of preserving the
free and industrialized nations.
Some of the underdeveloped areas
may very well temporarily suc
cumb to Russian or Chinese con
trol. But, what of it? The “free
dom” of these countries is impor
tant to us now because of their
strategic value in our present pol
icy.

IN THE policy proposed here,
they would have little strategic
value. Even their economic value
cannot make or break our own
economy. Most of these nations
will undoubtedly soon shake off
the yoke of Russian domination
anyway. Having just got rid of one
set of foreign oppressors, they
won’t welcome a second set.
They’ve learned to prefer the do
mestic breed of oppressors.
Granted the possibility that
Russia may invade us and other
countries, how likely is it? Not
very. With the United States no
longer a military power, Russia
should soon have her hands full
elsewhere. At present; a common
cause opposition to the U.S.
holds Russia and China together.
The bonds of Sino-Soviet friend
ship probably wouldn't survive
the death of this common cause
by more than a few months.
Two big unopposed world pow
ers seldom coexist amicably. Rus
sia and China are already at odds
on many issues. Given their ag
gressive foreign policies, their dif
ferences should become more pro
nounced, especially if we help
China break her dependence on
Russia.

set of foreign oppressors, they
won’t welcome a second set.
They’ve learned to prefer the do

Granted the possibility that
Russia may invade us and other
countries, how likely is it? Not
very. With the United States no
longer a military power, Russia
should soon have her hands full
elsewhere. At present; a common
cause opposition to the U.S.
holds Russia and China together.
The bonds of Sino-Soviet friend
ship probably wouldn't survive
the death of this common cause
by more than a few months.
Two big unopposed world pow
ers seldom coexist amicably. Rus
sia and China are already at odds
on many issues. Given their ag
gressive foreign policies, their dif
ferences should become more pro
nounced, especially if we help
China break her dependence on
Russia.

WHAT, THEN, is the worst pos
sible outcome of our present poli
cy? Obviously, nuclear war. The
potential horrors of nuclear war
need no elaboration here. Suffice
it to say that the American way of
life would be totally destroyed,
and it could not be rebuilt within
the foreseeable future, if, indeed,
life itself could over fully recover.
Is such a disaster a likely out
come of our present policy? It
would seem an almost inevitable
one. That the present nuclear stale
mate should continue indefinitely
is unimaginable. Yet, how else can
we terminate the status quo save
through nuclear war? What
chance is there of a negotiated set
tlement?

The cold war began in earnest
13 years ago. Russia and the U.S.
are farther from peace now than
at any other time. Russia tests 50-
megaton bombs and the U.S.
builds up her military strength in
Western Europe. Mistrust and
hale grow stronger every day, yet.

poses mutual trust.

HOW MUCH longer can we con
tinue the game of brinkmanship?
How many more situations like
Berlin can pass before both coun
tries commit themselves to posi
tions from w'hich they can no long
er negotiate?

When we stack the policies up
against one another, the possible
consequences of present policy ap
pear much worse; their likelihood
much greater. To the intelligent
gambler, unilateral disarmament
would seem much the hotter bet.
Unfortunately, very few people
gamble intelligently.
The trouble with most argu
ments for unilateral disarmament
is that they rest on moral concerns
for the good of humanity. Morali
ty is a pleasant luxury, but, unfor
tunately, no nation can afford to
indulge in it while pursuing inter
national policy.
Nevertheless, unilateral disar
mament, with certain modifica
tions, may well be the most ration
al policy, if we define the most ra
tional policy as that policy which
stands the best chance of preserv
ing for us and our progeny what
we loosely term “the American
way of life.”

Simple unilateral disarmament
has one big disadvantage —it
leaves us totally defenseless
against foreign imperialists. We
can modify this by preparing our
selves in advance for guerrilla
warfare. Such preparation would
involve training the entire male
population in the guerrilla tactics
best suited to their local terrain.
In addition, we would stockpile
hundreds of thousands of small
arms, automatic rifles, grenades,
explosives, etc. in thousands of
hidden caches throughout the U.S.

SUCH A DEFENSE would make
us easy to invade but impossible
to subdue. The French, witli one
of the best trained and equipped
armies in the world, have found it
impossible to subdue the Algeri
ans. And the Algerian guerrilla
revolution was organized from
scratch in the midst of an already
existent tyranny. Nor have the
French failed because of unwill
ingness to stoop to the most brutal
and inhumane methods of sup
pression. The Algerian repression
has often been extremely brutal.
Theoretically, the Russians
could decide to exterminate us
atomically. However, this seems
most unlikely for a number of rea
sons, the least of which is the
quite credible assumption that the
Russians, terrible though they
may well be, are not such complete
ogres as that.
First, they would run the con
siderable risk of poisoning the
rest of the world’s population,
their own included. Second, the
Russians want to rule the rest of
the world, not exterminate it.
Should they ruthlessly extermi
nate us, they would engender so
much hate and fear in the other
countries of the world, that the

only way to subdue them would be
to exterminate them likewise.
I THINK WE can credit Khrush
chov with enough intelligence to
see the overwhelming disadvan
tages of such a policy as world ex
termination. After all, a tyrant
needs someone to tyrannize.

So. it seems the worst that could
happen would be a Russian inva
sion. Inevitably, it would fail.
The Russians might destroy a
good many of our cities and much
of our industry. But even in this
worst of all likely events, we
would still have something left
from which to build anew our way
of life.
Of course, we have to reckon
with the effect unilateral disarma
ment might have on our allies. Our
allies in North America, Western
Europe, and Australia would have
little choice but to follow suit.

NO ONE, with the exception of
Charles de Gaulle, is so naive as to
think that the free world is capa
ble of opposing Russia in atomic
or conventional warfare without
the United States. Even with the
United States, it is touch and go.
To ally themselves with Russia
while she subdued us would be
short sighted, to say the least,
since they would surely be next on
the list. The only means of protec
tion left would be to make them
selves as unpalatable a morsel as
possible by training their men to
fight guerrilla warfare. Such a de
fense should considerably de
crease the likelihood of a Russian
invasion.

There ought, therefore, to be a
decent chance of preserving the
free and industrialized nations.
Some of the underdeveloped areas
may very well temporarily suc
cumb to Russian or Chinese con
trol. But, what of it? The “free
dom” of these countries is impor
tant to us now because of their
strategic value in our present pol
icy.

IN THE policy proposed here,
they would have little strategic
value. Even their economic value
cannot make or break our own
economy. Most of these nations
will undoubtedly soon shake off
the yoke of Russian domination
anyway. Having just got rid of one
set of foreign oppressors, they
won’t welcome a second set.
