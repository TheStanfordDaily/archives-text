# STAFF OPINION
## Student Peace Union Operation Explained 
### JOHN F. STRAIN 
The Student Peace Union has
come into the news lately, particu
larly in connection with the dem
onstration in Berkeley on Nov. 11,
but little has been said as to just
what the organization is, what it
stands for, and what part it may
come to play at Stanford in the
future.

The SPU originated as a local
peace group at the University of
Chicago two years ago. Since that
time it has seen a great deal of
growth, especially since its expan
sion in scope last year 1 to include
the whole country.

There are now member s on over
120 campuses throughout the na
tion, trnd nearly 50 campuses have
peace groups affiliated with the
SPU. At present there are two
members of the SPU living on
campus, and no SPU-affiliated
group exists in the Stanford area.
IT SHOULD ALSO bo pointed
out that although the SPU makes
use of the semaphore ND emblem
(used most notably in England by
the Campaign for Nuclear Disar
mament), this is also the emblem
of many other peace groups in the
United States as well as of the
peace movement in general and
therefore should not be construed
as designating a member of the
SPU exclusively.

Membership in the SPU is con
tingent only upon acceptance of
the Statement of Purposes, which
composes Article II of the SPU
Constitution. It is important
enough to warrant quotation in
its entirety;

“The Student Peace Union is an
organization of young people who
believe that war can no longer be
successfully used to settle inter
national disputes and that neither
human freedom nor the human
race itself can endure in a world
committed to militarism.

“WITHOUT committing any
member to a precise statement of
policy, the SPU draws together
young people for a study of alter
natives to war and engages in edu
cation and action to end the pres
ent arms race.
“The SPU works toward a soci
ety which will insure both peace
and freedom and which will suffer
no individual or group to be ex
ploited by another.

“After years of bad faith shown
by both East and West in disarma
ment negotiations, the Student
Peace Union believes that to be ef
fective, any peace movement must
act independently of the existing
power blocs and must seek new
and creative means of achieving a
free and peaceful society.”

JUST AS the individual member
of the SPU Is free to maintain be
lief in his own approach to the
problem of the establishment of a
true state of peace in the world,
so also is the affiliated peace
group (not all members belong to
SPU) and the chapter (all mem
bers are also members of SPU)
completely autonomous in its ac
tions providing it acts in accord
with the Statement of Purposes.
It was, for example, in this con
text that the Berkeley chapter of
SPU sponsored a demonstration in
Berkeley on Nov. 11—not the Na
tional Office of SPU or SPU as a
national organization.
In summing up this brief intro
ductory statement on the Student
Peace Union, the concluding para
graph in the promotional leaflet of
SPU sems quite apropos:
“THE SPU is a broad organiza
tion encompassing many view
points. The organization contains
pacifists and non-pacifists and the

whole range of political and re
ligious beliefs. It is not so much a
philosophy wo have in common;
rather, it is a unity of concern and
a desire to explore new issues.”
The members of SPU on campus
do not plan the formation of a
peace group at Stanford.
However, questions which may
arise concerning the SPU may be
answered either by writing the
Student Peace Union National Of
fice at 6029 S. University, Chicago
37, 111. (one might wish to request
a copy of the SPU Constitution,
available at no charge) or by con
tacting the writer in person or by
writing him at Box 3736, Stanford.
