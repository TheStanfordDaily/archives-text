# Red Cops Fire At 5 Fleeing East Germans
## 
### 
BERLIN (UPIi Communist
police fired at least 100 shots last
night at five East Germans who
raced to freedom through Commu
nist barricades in an ancient fliv
ver. It was the heaviest fire since
the Aug. 13 border closing.
West Berlin police held their
fire a-s the two men and three wom
en steered the vintage automobile
through zig zag road barricades to
the freedom of West Berlin.

At least six bullets pierced the
car, which was built in the early
1930\5, but apparently none of.the
occupants was hit, West Berlin po
lice said.

IN ANOTHER border incident
last night West Berlin police
claimed another victory in a tear
gas grenade duel with the Commu
nist police Vopos of East Berlin.
The Vopos hurled 60 grenades at a
loudspeaker truck in the West and
the West Berliners tossed 60 back
at them.

The Communists fled as they
have done in almost every similar
incident.

Earlier, the East Germans
boasted they would force the West
ern Allies to negotiate on Berlin
this year “if they do not want to
give up West Berlin completely.”

Horst Sindermann, candidate
member of the East German Com
munist Party Central Committo,
said in a statement published yes
terday “we will not allow negoti
ations to be postponed indefinite
ly .. . Through negotiations we
will be able to conclude the peace
treaty bit by bit. A West Berlin
agreement would be the first bit.’’
SINDERMANN said the West
ern Allies would have to grant
East Germany de facto recogni
tion by allowing East Gorman con
trol of Western Allied traffic.

A U.S. State Department official
said yesterday that Gen. Lucius
D. Clay, President Kennedy’s per
sonal representative-in Berlin, has
no immediate plans to return to
Washington.
American officials interpreted
the statement as a denial of pub
lished reports (hat Clay may re
turn home soon because of differ
ences with Kennedy over Berlin
policy.
