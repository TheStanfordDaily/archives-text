## Right-Wing 'Paranoia' Analyzed 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ 
"American society is seeing its
own death. To understand it is too
terrible. The politics of paranoia
develops, that is, the new right.
If it develops, it may turn society
to the far right and international
suicide.”
Michael Harrington, editor of
the Socialist organ “New Ameri
ca,” last night analyzed the new
American right wing as the seri
ous problem he describes above.
“THEIR PASSION comes from
crisis. In the face of the Commu
nists winning, there is a tendency
to look for an easy answer.”
The right winger, according to
Harrington, sees Cuba 90 miles
away. He can’t understand that
Communism got there through the
decadence of society, so he con
jures up a “devil theory.”
With a basis of international
crisis yielding political paranoia,
and backed by a power base of an
industrial-military complex, the
right wing rises—in the absence
of alternatives—as a movement
among masses of people who can’t
understand the world.
ACCORDING TO the Socialist
editor, the danger of the move
ment doesn’t lie within the Birch
ers, but within the intellectual
core of tho right.
Fred Schwarz’ “Christian Anti-
Communist Crusade,” which
“moves into an area to conduct
six weeks or so of intensive brain
washing,” is dangerous because it
is organized. And its organization
is one which calls our problem one
of “strategy,” implying not our
system, but our technique must be
changed.
The core of the right wing
movement “resembles nothing so
closely as the Communist move
ment.” and can be met only by pro
viding a democratic, international
alternative to communism. This
can only bo reached by meeting
domestic racism (which, states
Harrington, “is closely allied with
this now right”) technological un
employment. etc.
“What wc need,” he said in a
concluding manner, “is a demo
cratic revolution.”
