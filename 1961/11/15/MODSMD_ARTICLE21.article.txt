HERMANN COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Hermann’s “Peace Demon
stration Report” was interesting
but lacking in factual explanation.
I would like to supply a part of
this explanation and to reply to
Mr. Hermann’s objections to peace
demonstrations.
I am sorry that after Mr. Her
mann’s search for the members of
the extremist element of the dem
onstrators (a minority that exists
in almost any type of group) he
did not have time to investigate
the purpose of peace demonstra
tions or to talk with a wider spec
trum of demonstrators.
There are three primary objec
tives of peace demonstrations:
l.i Individual expression of be
liefs. This idealistic objective is
achieved in most demonstrations.
The individual with nuclear paci
fist beliefs may feel that his con
science will not allow him to keep
silent. The demonstration is a
means of expression.
2. Propagation of a movement
for nuclear pacifism. A large per
centage of the populations of the
countries preparing for nuclear
war must become supporters of
nuclear pacifism before the gov
ernments of those countries may
be expected to adopt policies of
nuclear pacifism. Nuclear paci
fists therefore are interested in
expanding the movement for nu
clear pacifism.
3. i Influence national govern
ments to adopt policies of nuclear
pacifism. While the movement for
nuclear pacifism is small, this ob
jective is idealistic, but as the
movement grows this is becoming
increasingly practical as a large
enough group may nonviolently
compel adoption of an internation
al policy of nuclear pacifism. This
is the ultimate objective of the nu
clear pacifist through organiza
tions and demonstrations.

Mr. Hermann’s chief objection
to the demonstration appears to be
that pacifists are acting to achieve
t heir goals as well as talking about
them.

He has attempted to discredit
this action by connotative lan
guage, “unwashed,” “front organ
ization,” “shabbily-dressed,” by
attempted association with com
munism, and by appealing to
school loyalties and nationalistic
loyalties.
As a nuclear pacifist my only ap
peals are for loyalty to humanity
and civilization.

Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. Hermann’s
“Peace Demonstration Report,” I
admit that the limited observa
tions which were made on the re
cent peace demonstration at Ber
keley were probably correct. The
article •seemed to imply, however,
that every peace demonstration is
composed of “unwashed, shabbily
dressed, impulsive” individuals
who, for the most part, are radical,
uninformed reactionaries.
It must be remembered that the
University of California (23,000
students i is more likely to contain
a greater diversity of students
than Stanford. There is a strong
tendency for many Cal students
to become affiliated with clubs and
organizations such as fraternities,
sororities, SLATE. Co-ops, etc.
Many individuals deem it neces
sary to “belong” to a group, if for
no other reason, to find some se
curity among the 23.000. Peace
demonstrations always have at
tracted and will probably continue
to attract the individual who is
looking for group security. I dare
say Mr. Hermann talked to a few
of this type.
Another reason to account for
some of the pseudo-reactionaries
which Mr. Hermann encountered,
is the recent . . . banning of
SLATE from the Berkeley cam
pus. SLATE is an organization
which is concerned with political
issues of the day and usually takes
a glim view of anything and ev
erything which our government
does. Since SLATE’s banning,
many demonstrations have taken
place: at least one was in the form
of a peace demonstration.
My objection to Mr. Hermann’s
article is I hat he has accounted
only for the people of the sort . . .
I have described. I regret that Mr.
Hermann encountered a SLATE
organized peace demonstration in
stead of one organized by people
who are sincerely concerned that

our government will resolve to
military force as a political maneu
ver.
I know many well-educated peo
ple who have participated in peace
demonstrations, and they also
look down upon the pseudos which
the demonstration seems to at
tract.
I submit that Mr. Hermann not
forget the many people in profes
sions and similar occupations who
merely make use of a peace dem
onstration as a means to voice
their opinions in addition to their
many letters to congressmen.

I shall not call Ross Hermann’s
Individual Opinion (an article not
merely a letter) a Fascist don’t
worry. But I will say that he must
have gone into the Berkeley crowd
and, with his usual unerring in
stinct, picked out the worst pos
sible exponents, to illustrate his
point: that pacifists are by defini
tion a bunch of beatniks and fools.
1 am sure that anyone can go
into any crowd of demonstrators
and find similarly vapid people, if
(hat is what he is looking for.
If this “report” was to give the
impression of an unbiased ac
count, then I’m afraid you haven’t
convinced me at least. I am at
tacking Mr. Hermann’s method of
reporting first and foremost; I am
afraid that it shows a good deal
more of just plain bigotry than
should be allowed in a paper, es
pecially when his piece came un
der the guise of an impartial ar
ticle.

HERMANN COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Hermann’s “Peace Demon
stration Report” was interesting
but lacking in factual explanation.
I would like to supply a part of
this explanation and to reply to
Mr. Hermann’s objections to peace
demonstrations.
I am sorry that after Mr. Her
mann’s search for the members of
the extremist element of the dem
onstrators (a minority that exists
in almost any type of group) he
did not have time to investigate
the purpose of peace demonstra
tions or to talk with a wider spec
trum of demonstrators.
There are three primary objec
tives of peace demonstrations:
l.i Individual expression of be
liefs. This idealistic objective is
achieved in most demonstrations.
The individual with nuclear paci
fist beliefs may feel that his con
science will not allow him to keep
silent. The demonstration is a
means of expression.
2. Propagation of a movement
for nuclear pacifism. A large per
centage of the populations of the
countries preparing for nuclear
war must become supporters of
nuclear pacifism before the gov
ernments of those countries may
be expected to adopt policies of
nuclear pacifism. Nuclear paci
fists therefore are interested in
expanding the movement for nu
clear pacifism.
3. i Influence national govern
ments to adopt policies of nuclear
pacifism. While the movement for
nuclear pacifism is small, this ob
jective is idealistic, but as the
movement grows this is becoming
increasingly practical as a large
enough group may nonviolently
compel adoption of an internation
al policy of nuclear pacifism. This
is the ultimate objective of the nu
clear pacifist through organiza
tions and demonstrations.

Mr. Hermann’s chief objection
to the demonstration appears to be
that pacifists are acting to achieve
t heir goals as well as talking about
them.

He has attempted to discredit
this action by connotative lan
guage, “unwashed,” “front organ
ization,” “shabbily-dressed,” by
attempted association with com
munism, and by appealing to
school loyalties and nationalistic
loyalties.
As a nuclear pacifist my only ap
peals are for loyalty to humanity
and civilization.
David C. Milne
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. Hermann’s
“Peace Demonstration Report,” I
admit that the limited observa
tions which were made on the re
cent peace demonstration at Ber
keley were probably correct. The
article •seemed to imply, however,
that every peace demonstration is
composed of “unwashed, shabbily
dressed, impulsive” individuals
who, for the most part, are radical,
uninformed reactionaries.
It must be remembered that the
University of California (23,000
students i is more likely to contain
a greater diversity of students
than Stanford. There is a strong
tendency for many Cal students
to become affiliated with clubs and
organizations such as fraternities,
sororities, SLATE. Co-ops, etc.
Many individuals deem it neces
sary to “belong” to a group, if for
no other reason, to find some se
curity among the 23.000. Peace
demonstrations always have at
tracted and will probably continue
to attract the individual who is
looking for group security. I dare
say Mr. Hermann talked to a few
of this type.
Another reason to account for
some of the pseudo-reactionaries
which Mr. Hermann encountered,
is the recent . . . banning of
SLATE from the Berkeley cam
pus. SLATE is an organization
which is concerned with political
issues of the day and usually takes
a glim view of anything and ev
erything which our government
does. Since SLATE’s banning,
many demonstrations have taken
place: at least one was in the form
of a peace demonstration.
My objection to Mr. Hermann’s
article is I hat he has accounted
only for the people of the sort . . .
I have described. I regret that Mr.
Hermann encountered a SLATE
organized peace demonstration in
stead of one organized by people
who are sincerely concerned that

our government will resolve to
military force as a political maneu
ver.
I know many well-educated peo
ple who have participated in peace
demonstrations, and they also
look down upon the pseudos which
the demonstration seems to at
tract.
I submit that Mr. Hermann not
forget the many people in profes
sions and similar occupations who
merely make use of a peace dem
onstration as a means to voice
their opinions in addition to their
many letters to congressmen.

I shall not call Ross Hermann’s

have gone into the Berkeley crowd
and, with his usual unerring in

sible exponents, to illustrate his
point: that pacifists are by defini
tion a bunch of beatniks and fools.
1 am sure that anyone can go
into any crowd of demonstrators
and find similarly vapid people, if
(hat is what he is looking for.

article is I hat he has accounted
only for the people of the sort . . .
I have described. I regret that Mr.
Hermann encountered a SLATE
organized peace demonstration in
stead of one organized by people
who are sincerely concerned that

our government will resolve to
military force as a political maneu
ver.
I know many well-educated peo
ple who have participated in peace
demonstrations, and they also
look down upon the pseudos which
the demonstration seems to at
tract.
I submit that Mr. Hermann not
forget the many people in profes
sions and similar occupations who
merely make use of a peace dem
onstration as a means to voice
their opinions in addition to their
many letters to congressmen.

I shall not call Ross Hermann’s
Individual Opinion (an article not
merely a letter) a Fascist don’t
worry. But I will say that he must
have gone into the Berkeley crowd
and, with his usual unerring in
stinct, picked out the worst pos
sible exponents, to illustrate his
point: that pacifists are by defini
tion a bunch of beatniks and fools.
1 am sure that anyone can go
into any crowd of demonstrators
and find similarly vapid people, if
(hat is what he is looking for.
If this “report” was to give the
impression of an unbiased ac
count, then I’m afraid you haven’t
convinced me at least. I am at
tacking Mr. Hermann’s method of
reporting first and foremost; I am
afraid that it shows a good deal
more of just plain bigotry than
should be allowed in a paper, es
pecially when his piece came un
der the guise of an impartial ar
ticle.

HERMANN COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Hermann’s “Peace Demon
stration Report” was interesting
but lacking in factual explanation.
I would like to supply a part of
this explanation and to reply to
Mr. Hermann’s objections to peace
demonstrations.
I am sorry that after Mr. Her
mann’s search for the members of
the extremist element of the dem
onstrators (a minority that exists
in almost any type of group) he
did not have time to investigate
the purpose of peace demonstra
tions or to talk with a wider spec
trum of demonstrators.
There are three primary objec
tives of peace demonstrations:
l.i Individual expression of be
liefs. This idealistic objective is
achieved in most demonstrations.
The individual with nuclear paci
fist beliefs may feel that his con
science will not allow him to keep
silent. The demonstration is a
means of expression.
2. Propagation of a movement
for nuclear pacifism. A large per
centage of the populations of the
countries preparing for nuclear
war must become supporters of
nuclear pacifism before the gov
ernments of those countries may
be expected to adopt policies of
nuclear pacifism. Nuclear paci
fists therefore are interested in
expanding the movement for nu
clear pacifism.
3. i Influence national govern
ments to adopt policies of nuclear
pacifism. While the movement for
nuclear pacifism is small, this ob
jective is idealistic, but as the
movement grows this is becoming
increasingly practical as a large
enough group may nonviolently
compel adoption of an internation
al policy of nuclear pacifism. This
is the ultimate objective of the nu
clear pacifist through organiza
tions and demonstrations.

Mr. Hermann’s chief objection
to the demonstration appears to be
that pacifists are acting to achieve
t heir goals as well as talking about
them.

He has attempted to discredit
this action by connotative lan
guage, “unwashed,” “front organ
ization,” “shabbily-dressed,” by
attempted association with com
munism, and by appealing to
school loyalties and nationalistic
loyalties.
As a nuclear pacifist my only ap
peals are for loyalty to humanity
and civilization.
David C. Milne
Editor, The Daily:
In reference to Mr. Hermann’s
“Peace Demonstration Report,” I
admit that the limited observa
tions which were made on the re
cent peace demonstration at Ber
keley were probably correct. The
article •seemed to imply, however,
that every peace demonstration is
composed of “unwashed, shabbily
dressed, impulsive” individuals
who, for the most part, are radical,
uninformed reactionaries.
It must be remembered that the
University of California (23,000
students i is more likely to contain
a greater diversity of students
than Stanford. There is a strong
tendency for many Cal students
to become affiliated with clubs and
organizations such as fraternities,
sororities, SLATE. Co-ops, etc.
Many individuals deem it neces
sary to “belong” to a group, if for
no other reason, to find some se
curity among the 23.000. Peace
demonstrations always have at
tracted and will probably continue
to attract the individual who is
looking for group security. I dare
say Mr. Hermann talked to a few
of this type.
Another reason to account for
some of the pseudo-reactionaries
which Mr. Hermann encountered,
is the recent . . . banning of
SLATE from the Berkeley cam
pus. SLATE is an organization
which is concerned with political
issues of the day and usually takes
a glim view of anything and ev
erything which our government
does. Since SLATE’s banning,
many demonstrations have taken
place: at least one was in the form
of a peace demonstration.

article •seemed to imply, however,
that every peace demonstration is
composed of “unwashed, shabbily
dressed, impulsive” individuals
who, for the most part, are radical,
uninformed reactionaries.
It must be remembered that the
University of California (23,000
students i is more likely to contain
a greater diversity of students
than Stanford. There is a strong
tendency for many Cal students
to become affiliated with clubs and
organizations such as fraternities,
sororities, SLATE. Co-ops, etc.
Many individuals deem it neces
sary to “belong” to a group, if for
no other reason, to find some se
curity among the 23.000. Peace
demonstrations always have at
tracted and will probably continue
to attract the individual who is
looking for group security. I dare
say Mr. Hermann talked to a few
of this type.
Another reason to account for
some of the pseudo-reactionaries
which Mr. Hermann encountered,
is the recent . . . banning of
SLATE from the Berkeley cam
pus. SLATE is an organization
which is concerned with political
issues of the day and usually takes
a glim view of anything and ev
erything which our government
does. Since SLATE’s banning,
many demonstrations have taken
place: at least one was in the form
of a peace demonstration.
My objection to Mr. Hermann’s
article is I hat he has accounted
only for the people of the sort . . .
I have described. I regret that Mr.
Hermann encountered a SLATE
organized peace demonstration in
stead of one organized by people
who are sincerely concerned that

our government will resolve to
military force as a political maneu
ver.
I know many well-educated peo
ple who have participated in peace
demonstrations, and they also
look down upon the pseudos which
the demonstration seems to at
tract.
I submit that Mr. Hermann not
forget the many people in profes
sions and similar occupations who
merely make use of a peace dem
onstration as a means to voice
their opinions in addition to their
many letters to congressmen.

I shall not call Ross Hermann’s
Individual Opinion (an article not

have gone into the Berkeley crowd

point: that pacifists are by defini

1 am sure that anyone can go
into any crowd of demonstrators
and find similarly vapid people, if
(hat is what he is looking for.
If this “report” was to give the
impression of an unbiased ac

convinced me at least. I am at
tacking Mr. Hermann’s method of

afraid that it shows a good deal
more of just plain bigotry than
should be allowed in a paper, es
pecially when his piece came un

HERMANN COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Hermann’s “Peace Demon
stration Report” was interesting
but lacking in factual explanation.
I would like to supply a part of
this explanation and to reply to
Mr. Hermann’s objections to peace
demonstrations.
I am sorry that after Mr. Her
mann’s search for the members of
the extremist element of the dem
onstrators (a minority that exists
in almost any type of group) he
did not have time to investigate
the purpose of peace demonstra
tions or to talk with a wider spec
trum of demonstrators.
There are three primary objec
tives of peace demonstrations:
l.i Individual expression of be
liefs. This idealistic objective is
achieved in most demonstrations.
The individual with nuclear paci
fist beliefs may feel that his con
science will not allow him to keep
silent. The demonstration is a
means of expression.
2. Propagation of a movement
for nuclear pacifism. A large per
centage of the populations of the
countries preparing for nuclear
war must become supporters of
nuclear pacifism before the gov
ernments of those countries may
be expected to adopt policies of
nuclear pacifism. Nuclear paci
fists therefore are interested in
expanding the movement for nu
clear pacifism.
3. i Influence national govern
ments to adopt policies of nuclear
pacifism. While the movement for
nuclear pacifism is small, this ob
jective is idealistic, but as the
movement grows this is becoming
increasingly practical as a large
enough group may nonviolently
compel adoption of an internation
al policy of nuclear pacifism. This
is the ultimate objective of the nu
clear pacifist through organiza
tions and demonstrations.

Mr. Hermann’s chief objection
to the demonstration appears to be
that pacifists are acting to achieve
t heir goals as well as talking about
them.

He has attempted to discredit
this action by connotative lan
guage, “unwashed,” “front organ
ization,” “shabbily-dressed,” by
attempted association with com
munism, and by appealing to
school loyalties and nationalistic
loyalties.
As a nuclear pacifist my only ap
peals are for loyalty to humanity
and civilization.

In reference to Mr. Hermann’s
“Peace Demonstration Report,” I
admit that the limited observa
