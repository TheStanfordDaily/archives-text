# WSU Turns Tough in Time For Indian Clash Saturday
## 
### 
After struggling through the
major portion of a season which
was primarily distinguished for
defeat after defeat, the Washing
ton State football team lately
seems to have turned tiger. You
have 30 seconds to figure out who
the Cougars’ next opponent is.
Washington State spent the ear
ly part of the season losing badly
to such squads as Indiana, the
joke of the Big 10, San Jose State,
and other more respectable op
ponents.
IN FACT, up till last Saturday,
the Cougars had managed only
one venture into (he victory col
umn and that was at the expense
of Idaho, one of the sorriest out
fits in the country.
But last week Washington State
beat Oregon and Mel Renfro, 22-
21, and suddenly what looked to be
an easy Stanford win is now any
body’s guess. The Indians should
be favored by a few points, but
there are surer bets to be had.
Actually, the Cougars have
some pretty fair material and with
a recent change in attack they
should be tough customers for the
Tribe.
POSSESSORS of the top pass
catching end in the country, Hugh
Campbell, Washington State has
been primarily a passing outfit.
But Cougar coach Jim Sutherland
reverted to a running game last
week end with good results.
Quarterback Mel Melln, who
had been throwing to Campbell
for nearly two years now, was
benched in favor of Dave Mathie
son, and fullback George Reed
scored three touchdowns for the
Cougars.
Campbell’s pass completions
didn’t accumulate at their usual
rate, hut there were no complaints
from Sutherland. As a sophomore
last year Campbell set NCAA rec
ords with 66 pass receptions for
881 yards. He scored 10 touch
downs in the process.
