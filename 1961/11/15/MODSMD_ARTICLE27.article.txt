## 
### 
Stanford’s undefeated freshman
water polo squad powered to their
eleventh straight win of the sea
son with a 13-11 decision over
Menlo-Atherton High School in
the varsity pool yesterday.
The win marked the second this
year for the Papoose water polo
ists over the M-A Bears, who have
not lost to high school competition
this season.
Marty Hull led the frosh win
with a five-goal output, trailed by
Tom Chalberg and Mike Doscher
with three markers apiece. Hull
was named the game’s top per
former by frosh coach Jim Gaugh
ran, who cited the former Sequoia
High School (Redwood City) star
for both offensive and defensive
play.
Gaughran added that he was
pleased with the play of his
charges, especially with the first
team’s play in the third quarter
when the Papooses racked up a
big seven goals to only two for the
visitors.
Also singled out for praise was
Doscher. Only in his first season
ever in water polo competition, the
frosh stickout is the team’s most
improved player.
The next contest for the frosh
poloists comes against the Cal
Bearcubs in a preliminary to the
clash between the Indian and Bear
varsities this Saturday. The match
will be televised and should pro
vide Stanford’s toughest meet of
the year.
