# Arcos Wins over Cuadro by 27-0
## 
### 
Los Arcos bombed El Cuadro by
a 27-0 score to highlight yester
day’s intramural football action.
All of Arcos’ scores came on
passes with Jack Mayer opening
the point parade with a TD toss to
Frank Wallace. The pair teamed
up on the conversion, but in the
opposite order as Wallace hit
Mayer with a strike to make the
score 7-0.

Finding that throwing passes
wa« to his liking, the air-minded
Wallace hit for two more scoring
bulls-eyes to Chuck Goodwin and
Dave Ludwig.

The final score of the day came
when Goodwin tossed one into the
waiting arms of Jim Johnson to
make the final 27-0 margin.
In the day’s most exciting con
test, KA I scored a narrow 7-6 win
over Theta Xi I, while Law I, Phi
Belt I and Larkin scored default
victories over the Barflies, Cedro
II and Fremont respectively.
