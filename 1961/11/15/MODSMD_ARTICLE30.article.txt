### 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI i
A special United Nations investi
gating commission said yesterday
that “in all probability” former
Congolese Premier Patrice Lu
mumba was murdered by Belgian
mercenaries in the presence of
Katanga President Moise Tshom
be.
THE FOUR-nation commission
said the Central Congolese govern
ment headed by President Joseph
Kasavubu should share responsi
bility for the deaths of Lumumba
and two aides earlier this year be
cause it handed them over to their
enemies.
Of the actual murder the report
said:
“A great deal of suspicion is
cast on a certain Colonel Buyghe,
a Belgian mercenary, as being the
actual perpetrator of Lumumba’s
murder which was committed in
accordance with a prearranged
plan, and that a certain Captain
Gat, also a Belgian mercenary,
was at all times an accessory to
the crime.”
THE REPORT said (lie commis
sion “accepts as substantially true
the evidence that the prisoners
were killed on Jan, 17 after their
arrival in a villa not far from Elis
abethville and in all probability in
the presence of high officials of
the government of Katanga Prov
ince” including Tshombe.
The commission made its dec
laration in a 63-page report to the
General Assembly on its investiga
tion of Lumumba’s death.
