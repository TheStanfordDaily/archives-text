LONDON (UPD —Russia is ur
gently reorganizing its Navy in
the lace of growing American nu
clear dominance on, above and un
der the seas, the authoritative
“Jane's Fighting Ships’’ reported
yesterday.
The new edition of the reference
book was published coincident
with a belief in naval circles that
Russia is trying to develop a tor
pedo with a nuclear warhead in an
effort to counter the American ar
mada of 58 aircraft carriers.
IN THE EVENT of war the car
riers could loose hundreds of
planes carrying nuclear weapons
against Russian targets. One of
the top Soviet priorities is how to
deal with this threat to its life
lines.
Russia, with more submarines
than the rest of the world com
bined, is expected in any future
war to try to saturate the oceans
with its underseas craft. If it could
perfect an atomic torpedo it would
intensify the danger to Allied
ships.
“JANE’S” SAID THE United
States has two nuclear warheaded
torpedoes designed as submarine
killers, “Subroc” and “Astor.” But
until now there have not been any
reports of Russian progress in this
field.
“Jane’s” said the major reorgan
ization of the Russian navy is so
thorough that Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev has had to reverse his
opinion that the cruiser is obso
lete.
