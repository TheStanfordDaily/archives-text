of Indian civilization, has publish
ed a volume entitled “Zen, Rocks
and Water.”
The book, which emphasizes the
insignificant rather than the gran
diose, encompasses a scholarly in
troduction by Sir Herbert Read
noted British art historian and
ci itic; a philosophical commentary
by Spiegelberg; ant: a series of j
woodcuts all illuminating the
Taoist and Zen Buddhist way of
-seeing the meaning id' life in the
simplest forms of nature.
The spirit in which the subject I
has been approached is exempli- ]
tied by a quotation used in the in-1
troduction.
Read quotes D. T. Suzuki, fore- j
most interpreter of Zen Buddhism j
in the West: “Man is a thinking

reed but his great works are done
when he is not calculating and
thinking. ‘Childlikeness’ has to be
restored with long years of train
ing in the art of self-forgetful
ness.”
