HELSINKI (UPI) President
Urho Kekkonen dissolved the
Finnish Parliament yesterday un
der pressure from the Soviet Un
ion to seek a broader government
that would insure a strict neutral
foreign policy in the cold war.
PARLIAMENTARY sources
said Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko had told Finnish
Foreign Minister Ahti Karjalainen
the Soviet regarded the minority
government of the agrarian party
as "unstable” and suggested the
inclusion of Communists or leftist
Social Democrats.
Kekkonen’s announcement was
made shortly after Karjalainen re
turned from Moscow. Parliament
will remain in office until Feb. 17
and new elections will be hold on
Feb. 4 and 5. It was the fifth time
a Parliament was dissolved in 43
years of Finnish independence.
KEKKONEN issued an open
letter which said the “aggravation
of international tensions calls for
decisions that cannot be postponed
until after the parliamentary elec
tions due in summer, 1962.”
Prime Minister Martti Miettu
nen said the new elections would
be held to get firm backing for
Finland’s neutral foreign policy.
He blamed the "German ques
tion” for the Soviet Union’s con
cern for the Baltic area.
The decision to dissolve Parlia
ment was the first political assur
ance the Soviets asked as a guar
antee of Finland’s continued neu
trality, informed sources said.
