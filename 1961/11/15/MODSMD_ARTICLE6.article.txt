NEW YORK (UPI I Ravi Shankar, India's most
famous musician and composer, takes gentle excep
tion to Americans who define his music as “the
new jazz.”
Shankar will appear with his trio at 8:30 tonight
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
“After all,” he said in an interview, “Indian
artists have been playing these melodies fora thou
sand years, somewhat before jazz wa-s invented.”
ONE American jazz critic, however, insists Shan
kar’s rendition of classical Indian Regas is “the
coolest jazz this side of Delhi.”
Shankar said jazz contains only a small portion
of the subtle complexity of Indian music. Also, he
said, jazz lacks the sophistication of traditional In
dian music, rooted as it is in religion and philosophy.
“There are certain similarities,” he acknowl
edged in faultless English. “One is the departure in
Western music which allows for improvisation by
the musician. In India, it always has been the right
—the obligation of each artist to improvise.”
BELIEVED by many to be the world’s most
gifted and imaginative master of improvisation,
Shankar appreciates this new trait in progressive
American jazz, especially the West Coast school.
He also sees certain jazz musicians attempting to
create an intense discipline similar to that found in
Indian musicians.

Shankar has gained much of his fame through
virtuoso performance on the sitar, an instrument
which rates back 700 years in its present form.
Fashioned from a seasoned gourd and teakwood,
the sitar has a track of 20 metal frets with six or
seven main playing strings and 19 sympathetic reso
nating strings. It resembles a guitar, hut is infi
nitely more complex.
UNDER sponsorship of the Asia Society Pei

forming Arts Program, Shankar and his two associ
ates are on a three-month cross-country tour of the
United-States which will take them to nearly every
section of the country.

He is supported by Kanai Dutta on the tabla, a
two-piece drum, and N. C. Mullick on Ihe tamboura,
a string instrument providing the drone back
ground of Indian music.
Each Rega—and there are supposed to be 68,848
of them -depicts a principal mood such as tran
quility, loneliness or heroism. There are Rcgas for
all occasions, all times of day or night and all sea
sons.
WESTERN audiences must ‘'feel” the moaning
because it virtually is impossible to define the Rega
form to the uninitiated. Simply, it is a combination
of scale, style and embellishment, beginning slowly
without rhythm and increasing in tempo with the
addition of rhythm and drums.
At 41 years of age. Shankar is considered India’s
greatest sitarist and composer. He also has been
active in radio, as music director for All-India
Radio, television, ballet and films.
He is best known to American moviegoers as
composer of the “Apu" trilogy of films. Pie created
the entire score for “Father Panchali,” first of the
award-winning movies, in four hours.
“I WATCHED the film twice,” he said, “and then
started to play, attempting to say in music what I
thought tire film was saying in pictures.”
Shankar has played in the U.S. several times and
in almost every capital in the world. He says Amer
icans and West Germans respond to his music with
greater enthusiasm than any other people out
side India.
Shankar is the first of the artists to come here
in a new cultural exchange program initiated by the
Asia Society.
Tickets are on sale at Dinkclspie) Auditorium.
