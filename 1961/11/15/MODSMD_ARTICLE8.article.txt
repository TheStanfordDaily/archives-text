# PACE Gets $50,000 Gift
## 
### 
The Charles E. Merrill Trust
of New York has voted a grant
of $50,000 to the Stanford PACE
Program, entirely without re
strictions as to its use, President
Wallace Sterling has announced.
A previous grant of $50,000 was
made by the Trust to Stanford’s
Graduate School of Business for
its student loan program in late
1960.
Together the two gifts will earn
a bonus of $33,333 for Stanford
from the Ford Foundation.
The latest grant of the Merrill
Trust will be paid in two annual
installments. The first $25,000
already has been received, and
designation of its use is under
consideration.
The 1960 grant of $50,000 to
the student loan fund at the Grad
uate School of Business enabled
the School to borrow 10 times
that amount from banks for stu
dent loans.
Doan Ernest C. Arbuckle of the
Business School explained that
the new loan program “enables
us to multiply the generosity of
our friends by using their, sup
port to guarantee hank credit.”
