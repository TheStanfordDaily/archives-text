nuclear tests in any form.
• Refrain from using the terri
tory, territorial waters or air
space of Africa in testing, storing
or transporting nuclear weapons.
• Consider and respect the con
tinent of Africa as a de-nuclear
ized zone.
THE MEASURE was directed
primarily against France, which
ignored a U.N. appeal not to hold
atomic tests in the Sahara.
The United States joined
France in voting against the first
two provisions of the resolution.
Both wore among the 42 abstain
ers on the resolution as a whole,
as were most of the Western
powers.
The vote on the first clause—
against testing in Africa- was 61-
2, with 35 abstentions. On the

ing or transportation of weapons
—it was 56-2, with 40 abstentions.

states which declares the use of
nuclear weapons a direct viola
tion of the U.N. Charter, contrary
to international law and the laws
of humanity, directed against all
mankind and a crime against hu
manity.
The vote was 60-16, with 25 ab
stentions. The United States and
most of its Allies voted against
the measure.

effect, would have pointed out
that the U.N. Charter authorizes
the use of weapons in legitimate
self-defense, were voted down.
