# Sequoia Survives Ravages
## 
### CARL OLIVER 
The Palo Alto tree, a Peninsula
landmark that has become the
symbol of Stanford University, has
survived smog, smoke, drought
and termites for over 1,000 years.
Many have predicted its death
and 44 years ago a Stanford Uni
versity professor planted seven
redwood trees of the same species
(sequoia sempervirens) so that
one could be selected to bear the
title El Palo Alto after the original
tree died.

A team of tree surgeons exam
ined the 139-foot tall tree in April
and declared it to be in fair con
dition, suffering, however, from
smog, drought and termites.
Experts are now clearing dead
wood from the tree and painting
it with insecticides and a wood pre
servative. Termites also attacked
the tree in 1947 but the surgeons
say the two attacks will not
threaten the tree’s longevity.
To prevent San Francisquito
Creek from eroding the soil be
neath the tree, the city has lined
the bank in concrete. A sprinkler
attached to the top of the tree is
turned on once a week for half a
day to simulate the coastal fog
conditions in which the redwoods
normally thrive.
In 1917, Stanford botany profes
sor Dr. James G. Peirce planted
seven redwood seedlings in a cir
cle of land fronting the universi
ty’s physics building. Recognizing
that the health of El Palo Alto was
not good, Dr. Peirce proposed that
one of these saplings be selected
to bear the title, El Palo Alto, after
the original tree died.
The tree was discovered on Nov.
6, 1769 by Don Caspar de Portola
when the Spanish explorer was
searching for Monterey Bay. The
tree’s height was so impressive
that he named it El Palo Alto, the
tall tree.
