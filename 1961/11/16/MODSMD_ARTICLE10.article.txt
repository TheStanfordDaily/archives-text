# Midnight Activity Changes Cal 'C' Into Stanford 'S'
## 
### 
Several weeks of scheming and calculation by two Stanford me
chanical engineering major resulted Tuesday night in a major psy
chological victory over Cal.
Jn the dead of the night while the Berkeley campus slept, 13
Stanford students succeeded in transforming the concrete “C” on

Strawberry Hill in back of the Cab
stadium into a red “S”.
DAVE LEWIS, a senior mechan
ical engineering major and mem
ber of El Toro Club, reported that
the operation went off smoothly
without any hitches.
The crew left Stanford at 10:30
Tuesday night for Cal, attacked
the concrete “C" with jacks and
chains and succeeded in dragging
a section of it around to form an
“S”.
THEY THEN put on the finish
ing touches by painting it red and
then departed for Stanford at 5
a.m. Throughout all that time,
their activity went undiscovered.
The successful venture culmi
nated extensive and intricate plan
ning that began during the first
week of this quarter.
Lewis, along with Ron Boortz,
also a mechanical engineering ma
jor, made aerial photos of the area,
drew engineering maps showing
in detail the approach and exit
routes, and computed stress equa
tions for concrete.
FROM THESE equations, they
found that it would be feasible to
break through the concrete.
They then gathered together a
group of friends, who each chipped
in $5 to cover the expenses of rent
ing tools, taking the aerial photos,
and buying two gallons of red
paint. The whole project cost
about $65.
Lewis, who is the director of
rallies for the Rally Com. explain
ed that it was their purpose to
perpetrate an “original and colos
sal joke, that at the same time
would not be harmful.”
He reported that news of the
stunt has been well received by
Stanford student leaders.
