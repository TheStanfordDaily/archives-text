Facilities will be posted today at
the ASSU office.

Interviews for positions on the
committee will be held from 4 to 6

morrow and Saturday, and from 4
to 6 p.m. Monday, according to
Chairman Rick Muller.

A SUBCOMMITTEE of the Uni
versity President’s committee on
housing soon will begin re-evalua
tion of the student living program.
It consists of faculty and adminis
tration members.

ASSU President Bob Sayler told
Legislature two weeks ago that it
is vital that Stanford undergradu
ates make their feelings known on
their housing.
Muller said the new committee
hopes to make recommendations
and suggest ideas which will bene
fit each type of living group on
campus and help all student resi
dents make the best use possible of
the academic, cultural and social
opportunities of the University.
AN IMPORTANT part of the
committee’s job will be determin
ing how well the present philoso
phy and operation of living groups
is working, Muller said. The com
mittee also plans to look into the
desirability and possibility of in
stituting coeducaitonal housing at
Stanford, as has been done else-

where.
Muller said the committee wants
students from all living groups
who are interested in the campus
wide undergraduate housing pro
gram, yet who at the same time are
able to make known the opinions
of those in their own living groups.
