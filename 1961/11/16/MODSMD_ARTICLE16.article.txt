# WUS Objectives, History Described

### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Tin* follow
ing: article telling: the story of the
World University Service and its
activities was prepared by the
WUS staff of Stanford’s Institute
of International Relations.)

The dust had begun to settle on
Europe and World War I, the war
to end war, had ended. An enlight
ened few, however, saw that man’s
fight against tyranny was far
from over.
The founders of the World Uni
versity Service realized that edu
cation, and education only, could
maintain that thin line which holds
civilization back from catastrophe.
In the period between the two
wars the University Service pro
gram was primarily concerned
with the resettlement of refugee
students in Europe, and the recon
struction of university lodgings
and libraries.
SINCE World War II WUS has
grown to encompass 41 countries.
It is actively sponsored by the
three largest international religi
ous organizations for students:
Pax Romana, World Union of Jew
ish Students and the World Stu
dent Christian Federation. WUS
also is in close contact with vari
ous relief organizations of the
United Nations.

The WUS program in each coun
try is headed by a National Com
mittee. Contributions made by or
ganizations and students are sent
to this committee which, in turn,
determines the amount to he uti
lized within the country.
The internal programs, such as
the scholarship aid to the Hungari
an students in the United States,
ate entirely under the auspices of
the particular National Commit
tee.

ALONG with the maintenance
of its own projects, every country
donates funds to the international
treasury at WUS headquarters in
Geneva. This treasury is budgeted
by the WUS General Assembly
and its Executive Committee.

Each year the General Assem
bly, composed of elected represent
atives from the member countries
and the sponsoring organizations,
and 15 students drawn from vari
ous college and university cam
puses, meets to approve the Cen
tral Program proposed by the 15-
member Executive Committee.

WUS international aid attempts
to meet the needs of university
communities which are not touch
ed by other international agencies.
The four main fields of action are:
Student Lodging and Living, Stu
dent Health, Educational Activi
ties and Facilities, and Emergency
and Individual Aid.

HOSTELS AND temporary
housing, especially in India and
the Far East, constitute much of
the work in the first area, al
though progress is being made to
wards a more definite, long range
construction program.

The Health Service, in coopera
tion with the International Feder
ation of Medical Students, strives
for the general improvement of
health centers. Library supplies,
improved lectures and additional
courses fall into the division of Ed
ucational Activities.

The final category of Individu
al Aid grants special scholarships,
many on a credit and loan basis.
Emergency Aid, for the most part,
goes to refugee students who have
been forced to leave their cam
puses because of international
tensions.

UNDERLYING the WHS pro
gram is the belief that peace is the
product of understanding, and un
derstanding is promoted by educa
tion. The World University Serv
ice has made an impressive begin
ning towards this peace, but only
a beginning. The needs of the
world’s universities are great and
the present aid is but a finger to
the dike.

The spotlight of world attention
is focussed on the emerging Afri
can nations. There the World Uni
versity Service is actively promot
ing the much needed improvement
of the educational facilities, WUS
aid is given on the basis of proven
need, not as careless charity or as
a result of prejudiced politics.
The present WUS program is deal

ing with two of this continent’s
most pressing educational prob
lems.
In the Union of South Africa all
open, desegregated universities
have been ‘closed’ to any further
students. This new law has made
higher education for the non-white
virtually nonexistent and at its
best, drastically inadequate in fa
cilities and content.

A SPECIAL WUS committee,
the South African Committee in
Higher Education, has established
extra-mural courses for the non
white in preparation for external
degrees from the University of
London. University teachers and
post graduate students are par
ticipating in this project as tutors
to the South Africans.

The program is severely ham
pered by high costs and the apar
theid laws, but is progressing as it
is the only remaining possibility
for adequate university training.
In addition to this project the WUS
fund for South Africa is supplying
assistance to groups such as uni-

versity people and their families
who have been imprisoned by the
government.

The Algerian refugee students
pose another outstanding problem
in Africa. There are approximate
ly 1,100 refugee students in Tu
nisia, 850 of these in the city of
Tunis itself. Living conditions are
extremely overcrowded and al
most totally lacking in comfort.
THERE IS A long range pro
gram being developed for the con
struction of more adequate hous
ing. Financial assistance is also
being sent to procure medicines
for the diseases which are common
in this area.

The plight of the African stu
dent is repeated throughout the
Middle East and Asia. Numerous
universities are in as bad or worse
condition than that described. To
many of the students, hampered
financially, and sick from under
nourishment and disease, the
World University Service holds
out the only light in a darkening
world.

THE WORLD University Serv
ice in the United States is support
ed by the contributions of college
and university students across the
country. Their donations are sup
plemented by gifts from WUS’ five
sponsoring organizations: the
B’nai B’rlth Hillel Foundation, the
National Newman Club Founda
tion, the United States National
Student Association, the National
Student Christian Federation and
the National Student Council of
the Y.M.-Y.W.C.A.

In the years 1958-1959, approxi
mately $1,407,189 was collected.
Of this. $905,599 was utilized with
in the United States as scholarship
aid to Hungarian and Chinese
refugee students attending Amer
ican colleges and universities.
The remaining $501,590 was
used overseas through the Central
International Program. In the
year 1959-1960 about $1,500,000
was donated. The contribution to
the international organization
went into the construction of med
ical centers in Hong Kong and
Japan, the building and furnish
ing of dormitories in Greece, and
numerous other projects earmark
ed by the National Committee.
STANFORD’S annual World
University Service drive is here.
Money for this organization will
be raised through contests, auc
tions and solicitations. The vast
majority of Stanford students are
not gaining their education with
scholarship aid.
We, as a university community,
can afford to give to WUS. We can
not afford not to. Selfishly, each
donation is an aid to understand
ing which can lead to peace and
the preservation of our way of
life. There ai’e, however, other
reasons.

At Stanford we have excellent
opportunities for an education in
numerous fields. If we realize the
value of our own good fortune we
can not do less than extend aid to
others.

World University Service is
many sided, international, nation
al and local, but basically it is
every student who is willing to
help another student.

bly, composed of elected represent
atives from the member countries
and the sponsoring organizations,
and 15 students drawn from vari
ous college and university cam
puses, meets to approve the Cen
tral Program proposed by the 15-
member Executive Committee.

WUS international aid attempts
to meet the needs of university
communities which are not touch
ed by other international agencies.
The four main fields of action are:
Student Lodging and Living, Stu
dent Health, Educational Activi
ties and Facilities, and Emergency
and Individual Aid.

HOSTELS AND temporary
housing, especially in India and
the Far East, constitute much of
the work in the first area, al
though progress is being made to
wards a more definite, long range
construction program.

The Health Service, in coopera
tion with the International Feder
ation of Medical Students, strives
for the general improvement of
health centers. Library supplies,
improved lectures and additional
courses fall into the division of Ed
ucational Activities.

The final category of Individu
al Aid grants special scholarships,
many on a credit and loan basis.
Emergency Aid, for the most part,
goes to refugee students who have
been forced to leave their cam
puses because of international
tensions.

UNDERLYING the WHS pro
gram is the belief that peace is the
product of understanding, and un
derstanding is promoted by educa
tion. The World University Serv
ice has made an impressive begin
ning towards this peace, but only
a beginning. The needs of the
world’s universities are great and
the present aid is but a finger to
the dike.

The spotlight of world attention
is focussed on the emerging Afri
can nations. There the World Uni
versity Service is actively promot
ing the much needed improvement
of the educational facilities, WUS
aid is given on the basis of proven
need, not as careless charity or as
a result of prejudiced politics.
The present WUS program is deal

ing with two of this continent’s
most pressing educational prob
lems.
In the Union of South Africa all
open, desegregated universities
have been ‘closed’ to any further
students. This new law has made
higher education for the non-white
virtually nonexistent and at its
best, drastically inadequate in fa
cilities and content.

A SPECIAL WUS committee,
the South African Committee in
Higher Education, has established
extra-mural courses for the non
white in preparation for external
degrees from the University of
London. University teachers and
post graduate students are par
ticipating in this project as tutors
to the South Africans.

The program is severely ham
pered by high costs and the apar
theid laws, but is progressing as it
is the only remaining possibility
for adequate university training.
In addition to this project the WUS
fund for South Africa is supplying
assistance to groups such as uni-

versity people and their families
who have been imprisoned by the
government.

The Algerian refugee students
pose another outstanding problem
in Africa. There are approximate
ly 1,100 refugee students in Tu
nisia, 850 of these in the city of
Tunis itself. Living conditions are
extremely overcrowded and al
most totally lacking in comfort.
THERE IS A long range pro
gram being developed for the con
struction of more adequate hous
ing. Financial assistance is also
being sent to procure medicines
for the diseases which are common
in this area.

The plight of the African stu
dent is repeated throughout the
Middle East and Asia. Numerous
universities are in as bad or worse
condition than that described. To
many of the students, hampered
financially, and sick from under
nourishment and disease, the
World University Service holds
out the only light in a darkening
world.

THE WORLD University Serv
ice in the United States is support
ed by the contributions of college
and university students across the
country. Their donations are sup
plemented by gifts from WUS’ five
sponsoring organizations: the
B’nai B’rlth Hillel Foundation, the
National Newman Club Founda
tion, the United States National
Student Association, the National
Student Christian Federation and
the National Student Council of
the Y.M.-Y.W.C.A.

In the years 1958-1959, approxi
mately $1,407,189 was collected.
Of this. $905,599 was utilized with
in the United States as scholarship
aid to Hungarian and Chinese
refugee students attending Amer
ican colleges and universities.
The remaining $501,590 was
used overseas through the Central
International Program. In the
year 1959-1960 about $1,500,000
was donated. The contribution to
the international organization
went into the construction of med
ical centers in Hong Kong and
Japan, the building and furnish
ing of dormitories in Greece, and
numerous other projects earmark
ed by the National Committee.
STANFORD’S annual World
University Service drive is here.
Money for this organization will
be raised through contests, auc
tions and solicitations. The vast
majority of Stanford students are
not gaining their education with
scholarship aid.
We, as a university community,
can afford to give to WUS. We can
not afford not to. Selfishly, each
donation is an aid to understand
ing which can lead to peace and
the preservation of our way of
life. There ai’e, however, other
reasons.

At Stanford we have excellent
opportunities for an education in
numerous fields. If we realize the
value of our own good fortune we
can not do less than extend aid to
others.

World University Service is
many sided, international, nation
al and local, but basically it is
every student who is willing to
help another student.

of the educational facilities, WUS
aid is given on the basis of proven
need, not as careless charity or as
a result of prejudiced politics.
The present WUS program is deal

ing with two of this continent’s
most pressing educational prob
lems.
In the Union of South Africa all
open, desegregated universities
have been ‘closed’ to any further
students. This new law has made
higher education for the non-white
virtually nonexistent and at its
best, drastically inadequate in fa
cilities and content.

A SPECIAL WUS committee,
the South African Committee in
Higher Education, has established
extra-mural courses for the non
white in preparation for external
degrees from the University of
London. University teachers and
post graduate students are par
ticipating in this project as tutors
to the South Africans.

The program is severely ham
pered by high costs and the apar
theid laws, but is progressing as it
is the only remaining possibility
for adequate university training.
In addition to this project the WUS
fund for South Africa is supplying
assistance to groups such as uni-

versity people and their families
who have been imprisoned by the
government.

The Algerian refugee students
pose another outstanding problem
in Africa. There are approximate
ly 1,100 refugee students in Tu
nisia, 850 of these in the city of
Tunis itself. Living conditions are
extremely overcrowded and al
most totally lacking in comfort.
THERE IS A long range pro
gram being developed for the con
struction of more adequate hous
ing. Financial assistance is also
being sent to procure medicines
for the diseases which are common
in this area.

The plight of the African stu
dent is repeated throughout the
Middle East and Asia. Numerous
universities are in as bad or worse
condition than that described. To
many of the students, hampered
financially, and sick from under
nourishment and disease, the
World University Service holds
out the only light in a darkening
world.

THE WORLD University Serv
ice in the United States is support
ed by the contributions of college
and university students across the
country. Their donations are sup
plemented by gifts from WUS’ five
sponsoring organizations: the
B’nai B’rlth Hillel Foundation, the
National Newman Club Founda
tion, the United States National
Student Association, the National
Student Christian Federation and
the National Student Council of
the Y.M.-Y.W.C.A.

In the years 1958-1959, approxi
mately $1,407,189 was collected.
Of this. $905,599 was utilized with
in the United States as scholarship
aid to Hungarian and Chinese
refugee students attending Amer
ican colleges and universities.
The remaining $501,590 was
used overseas through the Central
International Program. In the
year 1959-1960 about $1,500,000
was donated. The contribution to
the international organization
went into the construction of med
ical centers in Hong Kong and
Japan, the building and furnish
ing of dormitories in Greece, and
numerous other projects earmark
ed by the National Committee.
STANFORD’S annual World
University Service drive is here.
Money for this organization will
be raised through contests, auc
tions and solicitations. The vast
majority of Stanford students are
not gaining their education with
scholarship aid.
We, as a university community,
can afford to give to WUS. We can
not afford not to. Selfishly, each
donation is an aid to understand
ing which can lead to peace and
the preservation of our way of
life. There ai’e, however, other
reasons.

At Stanford we have excellent
opportunities for an education in
numerous fields. If we realize the
value of our own good fortune we
can not do less than extend aid to
others.

World University Service is
many sided, international, nation
al and local, but basically it is
every student who is willing to
help another student.

The dust had begun to settle on
Europe and World War I, the war
to end war, had ended. An enlight
ened few, however, saw that man’s
fight against tyranny was far
from over.
The founders of the World Uni
versity Service realized that edu
cation, and education only, could
maintain that thin line which holds
civilization back from catastrophe.
In the period between the two
wars the University Service pro
gram was primarily concerned
with the resettlement of refugee
students in Europe, and the recon
struction of university lodgings
and libraries.
SINCE World War II WUS has
grown to encompass 41 countries.
It is actively sponsored by the
three largest international religi
ous organizations for students:
Pax Romana, World Union of Jew
ish Students and the World Stu
dent Christian Federation. WUS
also is in close contact with vari
ous relief organizations of the
United Nations.

The WUS program in each coun
try is headed by a National Com
mittee. Contributions made by or
ganizations and students are sent
to this committee which, in turn,
determines the amount to he uti
lized within the country.
The internal programs, such as
the scholarship aid to the Hungari
an students in the United States,
ate entirely under the auspices of
the particular National Commit
tee.

ALONG with the maintenance
of its own projects, every country
donates funds to the international
treasury at WUS headquarters in
Geneva. This treasury is budgeted
by the WUS General Assembly
and its Executive Committee.

Each year the General Assem
bly, composed of elected represent
atives from the member countries
and the sponsoring organizations,
and 15 students drawn from vari
ous college and university cam
puses, meets to approve the Cen
tral Program proposed by the 15-
member Executive Committee.

WUS international aid attempts
to meet the needs of university
communities which are not touch
ed by other international agencies.
The four main fields of action are:
Student Lodging and Living, Stu
dent Health, Educational Activi
ties and Facilities, and Emergency
and Individual Aid.

HOSTELS AND temporary
housing, especially in India and
the Far East, constitute much of
the work in the first area, al
though progress is being made to
wards a more definite, long range
construction program.

The Health Service, in coopera
tion with the International Feder
ation of Medical Students, strives
for the general improvement of
health centers. Library supplies,
improved lectures and additional
courses fall into the division of Ed
ucational Activities.

The final category of Individu
al Aid grants special scholarships,
many on a credit and loan basis.
Emergency Aid, for the most part,
goes to refugee students who have
been forced to leave their cam
puses because of international
tensions.

UNDERLYING the WHS pro
gram is the belief that peace is the
product of understanding, and un
derstanding is promoted by educa
tion. The World University Serv
ice has made an impressive begin
ning towards this peace, but only
a beginning. The needs of the
world’s universities are great and
the present aid is but a finger to

condition than that described. To
many of the students, hampered

nourishment and disease, the
World University Service holds
out the only light in a darkening
world.

THE WORLD University Serv
ice in the United States is support
ed by the contributions of college
and university students across the
country. Their donations are sup
plemented by gifts from WUS’ five
sponsoring organizations: the
B’nai B’rlth Hillel Foundation, the
National Newman Club Founda
tion, the United States National
Student Association, the National
Student Christian Federation and
the National Student Council of
the Y.M.-Y.W.C.A.

In the years 1958-1959, approxi
mately $1,407,189 was collected.
Of this. $905,599 was utilized with
in the United States as scholarship
aid to Hungarian and Chinese
refugee students attending Amer
ican colleges and universities.
The remaining $501,590 was
used overseas through the Central
International Program. In the
year 1959-1960 about $1,500,000
was donated. The contribution to
the international organization
went into the construction of med
ical centers in Hong Kong and
Japan, the building and furnish
ing of dormitories in Greece, and
numerous other projects earmark
ed by the National Committee.
STANFORD’S annual World
University Service drive is here.
Money for this organization will
be raised through contests, auc
tions and solicitations. The vast
majority of Stanford students are
not gaining their education with
scholarship aid.
We, as a university community,
can afford to give to WUS. We can
not afford not to. Selfishly, each
donation is an aid to understand
ing which can lead to peace and
the preservation of our way of
life. There ai’e, however, other
reasons.

At Stanford we have excellent
opportunities for an education in
numerous fields. If we realize the
value of our own good fortune we
can not do less than extend aid to
others.

World University Service is
many sided, international, nation
al and local, but basically it is
every student who is willing to
help another student.

The dust had begun to settle on
Europe and World War I, the war
to end war, had ended. An enlight
ened few, however, saw that man’s
fight against tyranny was far
from over.
The founders of the World Uni
versity Service realized that edu
cation, and education only, could
maintain that thin line which holds
civilization back from catastrophe.
In the period between the two
wars the University Service pro
gram was primarily concerned
with the resettlement of refugee
students in Europe, and the recon
struction of university lodgings
and libraries.
SINCE World War II WUS has
grown to encompass 41 countries.
It is actively sponsored by the
three largest international religi
ous organizations for students:
Pax Romana, World Union of Jew
ish Students and the World Stu
dent Christian Federation. WUS
also is in close contact with vari
ous relief organizations of the
United Nations.

The WUS program in each coun
try is headed by a National Com
mittee. Contributions made by or
ganizations and students are sent
to this committee which, in turn,
determines the amount to he uti
lized within the country.
The internal programs, such as
the scholarship aid to the Hungari
an students in the United States,
ate entirely under the auspices of
the particular National Commit
tee.

ALONG with the maintenance
of its own projects, every country
donates funds to the international
treasury at WUS headquarters in
Geneva. This treasury is budgeted
by the WUS General Assembly
and its Executive Committee.

Each year the General Assem
bly, composed of elected represent
atives from the member countries
and the sponsoring organizations,
and 15 students drawn from vari
ous college and university cam
puses, meets to approve the Cen
tral Program proposed by the 15-
member Executive Committee.

WUS international aid attempts
to meet the needs of university
communities which are not touch
ed by other international agencies.
The four main fields of action are:
Student Lodging and Living, Stu
dent Health, Educational Activi
ties and Facilities, and Emergency
and Individual Aid.

HOSTELS AND temporary
housing, especially in India and
the Far East, constitute much of
the work in the first area, al
though progress is being made to
wards a more definite, long range
construction program.

The Health Service, in coopera
tion with the International Feder
ation of Medical Students, strives
for the general improvement of
health centers. Library supplies,
improved lectures and additional
courses fall into the division of Ed
ucational Activities.

The final category of Individu
al Aid grants special scholarships,
many on a credit and loan basis.
Emergency Aid, for the most part,
goes to refugee students who have
been forced to leave their cam
puses because of international
tensions.

UNDERLYING the WHS pro
gram is the belief that peace is the
product of understanding, and un
derstanding is promoted by educa
tion. The World University Serv
ice has made an impressive begin
ning towards this peace, but only
a beginning. The needs of the
world’s universities are great and
the present aid is but a finger to
the dike.

The spotlight of world attention
is focussed on the emerging Afri
can nations. There the World Uni
versity Service is actively promot
ing the much needed improvement
of the educational facilities, WUS
aid is given on the basis of proven
need, not as careless charity or as
a result of prejudiced politics.
The present WUS program is deal

ing with two of this continent’s
most pressing educational prob
lems.
In the Union of South Africa all
open, desegregated universities
have been ‘closed’ to any further
students. This new law has made
higher education for the non-white
virtually nonexistent and at its
best, drastically inadequate in fa
cilities and content.

A SPECIAL WUS committee,
the South African Committee in
Higher Education, has established
extra-mural courses for the non
white in preparation for external
degrees from the University of
London. University teachers and
post graduate students are par
ticipating in this project as tutors
to the South Africans.

The program is severely ham
pered by high costs and the apar
theid laws, but is progressing as it
is the only remaining possibility
for adequate university training.
In addition to this project the WUS
fund for South Africa is supplying
assistance to groups such as uni-

versity people and their families
who have been imprisoned by the
government.

The Algerian refugee students
pose another outstanding problem
in Africa. There are approximate
ly 1,100 refugee students in Tu
nisia, 850 of these in the city of
Tunis itself. Living conditions are
extremely overcrowded and al
most totally lacking in comfort.
THERE IS A long range pro
gram being developed for the con
struction of more adequate hous
ing. Financial assistance is also
being sent to procure medicines
for the diseases which are common
in this area.

The plight of the African stu
dent is repeated throughout the
Middle East and Asia. Numerous
universities are in as bad or worse
condition than that described. To
