HERMANN COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
I don’t think anyone could argue
with your earnest desire for un
fettered expression of personal
opinion. In the case of Ross Her
mann, however, the question is not
one of freedom of speech, but of
waste of space.
The peculiarly simple-minded
and childishly malicious nature of
the two articles of his which I have
seen so far lead me to wonder
what purpose The Daily thinks it
is serving by devoting a quarter
of a page to such a feeble effort as
the so-called “Peace Demonstra
tion Report.”
To justify its existence, it seems
to me, this article could have been
a straightforward expression of
opinion; or it could have been what
it pretended to be—a candid, inter
view-type news report: or it could
have been a satirical entertain
ment.

As straightforward opinion,
Hermann’s piece was a supremely
inept attempt at backbiting: as a
report, it was worthless; as enter
tainment it was, to say the least,
sad.

The Daily should, by all means,
publish student opinion. But I sub
mit that opinions come across best
when you can see them; when
they’re not obscured by cute little
fogs of bigotry.
There’s plenty of room for that
in the “letters” section. It would
be refreshing if you could keep it
out of your sanctioned columns,
even if you can’t keep it out of the
minds of your staff writers.
John R. Nash
Editor, The Daily:
In Tuesday’s Daily the column
by Ross Hermann appeared under
the overline “Individual Opinion.”
Yesterday’s issue carried stories
by John Strain, overlined “Staff
Opinion,” and Randy Gallistel,
overlined “Campus Opinion.”
Could you clarify The Daily edi
torial policy on which writers get
which overlines, and why?
Bridger Mitchell
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The “Staff
Opinion” headline appeared in the
paper by mistake; it is no longer
in use, but somehow crept in any

way. “Campus Opinion” articles
are written by students or faculty
not on The Daily staff; some are
solicited, some are turned in with
out our asking-. Not all are accept

ed. John Strain’s article should
have had a “Campus Opinion”
headline.
The “Individual Opinion” ar
ticles are written by staff mem
bers only. We hope this clarifies
things.)
CLEAN CAMPUS
Editor, The Daily:
No clean-up campaign can ever
hope to be effective if it lacks sup
port and apparently Stanford stu
dents are not interested in keeping
their campus clean.
After three days of clean-up
campaign, the benches and tables
outside the Cellar are just as bad
as ever. 1 cannot understand why
this area should be so messy un
less it is because the students
want it to look like a pig-sty.
A person cannot possibly leave
this area without going past a
trash can, yet the students still
litter the area with coffee cups,
wooden spoons, napkins and sand
wich wrappers.
I propose that, henceforth, this
area be known as “The Pig-Sty.”

ARMS RACE
Editor, The Daily:
We sympathize with Mr. Bar
num’s meritorious if impractical
ideas contained in his recent let
ter on nuclear testing. Too often
we feel that the arms race is real
ly two governments against hu
manity, but it is naively idealistic
to assume that the only problem
which exists between the western
and Communist worlds is a nu
clear one.

Mr. Barnum does not seem to
realize the basic question at hand:
What would be the consequence
of unilateral disarmament by the
U.S. at this time? It cannot be con
cluded in the light of recent his
tory that Russia would follow suit.

Mr. Barnum’s “step in the op
posite direction’’ will not mollify
the aggressiveness shown by the
Communist states. In fact a strong
argument could be provided to the
contrary. The past actions and at
titudes of the Soviet Union indi
cate that Russian nuclear suprem
acy would not be confined solely
to self protection.
Therefore, if we were to disarm
at the present time we would not
be fulfilling our responsibilities to
the free world.

Mr. Barnum’s impassioned plea
for “somebody to swallow his
pride and muster some real cour
age for a step in the other direc
tion” is a misdirected one. The
motivation for American partici
pation in the arms race is not
prideful but realistic, while to dis
arm at the present time would not
be courageous, but foolhardy.

Last week we ran an advertise
ment in the Stanford Daily and
the response was overwhelming.
We didn’t get any cars in for re
pairs or new transmissions, nor
did anyone call for information as
to prices, services, etc. But, we
have been informed by the Busi
ness Dept, of this paper, who have
had much background in advertis
ing, that if we run another ad the
response will force us to enlarge.
We assume, of course, they meant
our quarters, not the advertising
budget. Since that department
wears Brooks Bros, suits we are
convinced that they know of what
they speak.

Remember for all automotive
repairs, particularly those trouble
some (we hope) automatic trans
missions, push your car to

P.S. Wo will also answor our phone at DA
1-2256 if yon want information over tho
phono. This is designed for those who are
ashamed to drive their cars during daylight
hours. We, of course, are sensitive to all
problems.
