# Army, Gizenga Revolt; Congo Again in Crisis
## 
### 
LEOPOLDVILLE (UPI)-Vice
Premier Antoine Gizenga, political
heir to slain pro-Communist Pa
trice Lumumba, rebelled openly
yesterday against the central Con
golese government and the United
Nations, Congolese army troops
mutinied in two cities.

The chaos brought the Congo to
its gravest hour since it won in
dependence from Belgium 17
months ago and led acting U.N.
Secretary General U Thant to or
der U.N. forces there to “take ev
ery measure possible” to restore
order.

The most critical area appeared
to be Kindu, a major Lualaba
River port and manufacturing
center in Kivu Province in central
Congo. Rebellious and drunken
troops, captured, beat and possibly
murdered 13 Italian U.N. airmen
and surrounded an outnumbered
Malayan U.N. force. The U.N.
command was believed preparing
to attack. Its jets were standing
by.

ANOTHER critical area was Al
bertville in the extreme eastern
Congo on Lake Tanganyika where
troops aided by Baluba tribesmen
stole 20 cars, looted houses, set
up road blocks and extorted mon
ey from passersby. Two hundred
Europeans, left at the Balubas’
mercy by withdrawing Katanga
troops, were reported to have fled
for their lives.

By far the most serious develop
ment was the revolt by the leftist
Gizenga, one-time vice premier in
Lumumba’s government. Diplo
matic sources said he had set up a
rival government backed by the
2,000 mutinous troops at Albert
ville and Kindu and declared his
opposition to the U.N.
He had set up a rival govern
ment at his stronghold of Stanley
ville once before and then reluc
tantly agreed to enter the central
government. His revolt meant the
collapse of the peace talks and per
haps the end of the government
effort to bring Katanga back into
the Congo.

IT COULD also mean the return
to the Congo of Communist diplo
mats expelled after Lumumba was
murdered.
