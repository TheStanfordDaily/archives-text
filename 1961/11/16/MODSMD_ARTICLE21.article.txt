Depending on whether you incline toward optimism or pessi
mism these days, the injury situation that currently faces Stanford’s
football team is either improving or still ridiculous.
From a manpower standpoint, tin* Indians will actually be
stronger than they have been in weeks when they host Washington

♦State Saturday. But a glance at
the number of minor afflictions
that will slow individuals down,
yet not keep them out of the game
altogether, is a distasteful experi
ence.
FOR INSTANCE, take the num
ber of at m and hand injuries pres
ently hampering the Tribe.
Among those practicing yester
day who were wearing bandages
and pads of varying sizes on some
part of the arm were linemen
George Honore, Chris Cottle, C. B.
Simons, Steve Player, John Butler
and Jack Gordon and backs Ken
Babajian and Ed Cummings.
Not all of these players are go
ing to be affected by their respec
tive hurts, but don’t start asking
about leg injuries.
HOWEVER, SOME returnees
who will see action against the
Cougars have saved the week
from being a total loss.
First on the list of those back
from the wounded who will give
Jack Curtice’s hospital corps some
thing extra with which to work, is
fullback Hal Steuber.
One of the top ball carriers for
the Indians before a Michigan
State defender broke his jay, Steu
ber has been functioning with his
mouth wired shut for the last five
weeks. He missed practice yester
day so a sympathetic doctor could
relieve him of the metal.
Also returning to action is de
fensive back Gary Sargoant, out
for a while with a badly swollen
foot.
As for practice, senior quarter
back Rod Sears has been working
with the first squad of late and
junior Jim Smith has been guiding
the fortunes of the second squad.
