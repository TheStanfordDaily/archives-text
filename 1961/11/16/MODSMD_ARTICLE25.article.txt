## '61 Freshmen Booters Will Bolster Varsity 
### 
Prospects for next year’s soccer
team are the brightest in years,
with the addition of the best frosh
soccer team in Stanford’s history.

The freshmen finished with five
wins and one tie in six games.'The
tie was a 0-0 affair with the pow
erful USF freshmen and among
the wins was an 8-1 triumph over
California.

The freshmen outscored their
opponents 29-2 in the six-game sea
son.

SO HIGHLY regarded are the
Stanford freshmen, they have
been selected to play on the team
which will face the University of
British Columbia this weekend.

An indication of the skill of the
frosh team is the 2-2 tie they
earned against the graduate soc
cer team. With such men as Sam
my Stevens, former All-American,
and Jan Achenb&ch, former all-
NCISC back, on the graduate
team, the grads almost unani
mously called the freshmen the
best team they faced.

Coach Leo Weinstein called
three freshmen sure bets to make
first team varsity next year, with
several others in contention for
first team berths.

THE THREE sure things are
goalie Tom Paulson, center half
Jim Armstrong, and wing Klaas
Bergman. The other possibilities
are fullback Sandy Gilbert, half
back Ben Wooten, and inside for
ward Pete Talbot.

Weinstein called Bergman “a
most gifted wing and inside. Tech
nically the best player we’ve had
at Stanford.” He cited Armstrong
as the mainstay of the defense.

Weinstein concluded that when
watching the freshmen play, “you
can see in them the joy of playing
well. They play elegantly.”
This year’s soccer season was
climaxed with four varsity mem
bers being named to the all-con
ference first or second teams.

ALBERT NNOLI, Hunt Bas
com. Emannuel Andah and Rusty
Williams received the honors, so
these talented freshment will have
something to shoot for if they are
to achieve the same success.
