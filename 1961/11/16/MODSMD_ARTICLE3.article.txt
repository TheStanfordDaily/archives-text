# Rayburn Still Clings to Life, But End Near
## 
### 
BONHAM, Tex. (UPI4-- House
Speaker Sam Rayburn, 79, near
death from cancer, clung weakly
to life last night.
“The speaker has not been alert
since the last bulletin 10:30 a.m.
EST,” a bulletin issued at 5:30
p.m., EST, said. “No apparent in
crease of weakness. Condition re
mains critical.”
“He’s tough,” Dr. Joe Risser,
his doctor, said. “These people of
pioneer stock will stay with you
and keep staying with you.”
He began failing late Tuesday
and his family gathered at his bed
side in Dr. Risser’s private hos
pital. But he managed to make it
through the night, sleeping “un
usually soundly.”
Relatives visited him in xelays
Wednesday.
Risser said, however, Rayburn
was no longer as alert as he had
been.
A spokesman for the Rayburn
family said death was “only a mat
ter of hours.”
Rayburn, Speaker of the House
more than twice as long as any
other man in history, no longer is
rallying from sinking spells.
Instead of regaining lost ground.
Rayburn simply stops sinking and
“holds his own” temporarily.
Rayburn’s sisters, Mrs. W. A.
Thomas of Dallas and Mrs. Louise
Bartley of Bonham, alternately
stayed in Rayburn’s groundfloor
room at Risser Hospital and wont
to the Speaker’s home to rest.
Rayburn’s illness was diagnosed
as cancer Oct. 5 after he had en
tered Baylor University Medical
Center in Daddas. The malignancy
is believed to be centered in his
pancreas, but has spread all over
his body.
