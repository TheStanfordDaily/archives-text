# Photos Show Diverse Africa
## 
### 
The African Desk and the Stan
ford Library are presenting a
photographic exhibition of Afri
can diversity in the foyer of the
Main Library. It will continue un
til Nov. 26.

“Tropical Africa is not one place
but many . . . and the many are all
different.’’ Thus George Kimble,
author of “Tropical Africa,” a two
volume survey, states a central
theme of his work—the diversity
of the land and people of the area.
“But this whole and quite fan
tastic diversity should be seen for
j what it is: A challenge to states
manship, understanding, humili
! ty.”
The pictures on exhibit were
taken by Kimble and his staff
while doing research for his book
and have been compiled by the
Smithsonian Institute Traveling
I Exhibition Service.
