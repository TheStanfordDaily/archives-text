# Man's Attitude, Sin Crucified Christ, Says Canon Green
## 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
“The rebellion, the sin, the attitude of man crucified Christ. This
is your sin and my sin. 1 would have said, ‘Crucify,’ and so would
you. This is the human fact.’’
This is the meaning of the moral drama of Christ on the Cross
at Calvary as presented by Canon Bryan Green in the second part

of his lecture on the active seeking
of God to bring man right with
Him. a search which is focused
in the event called Jesus Christ.
SPEARING LAST night in Me
morial Church, Green told his au
dience that Christ died because
man does not want God as God.
“We like Him as an idea, a kind of
parachute for escape,” Canon
Green said. “When God came to
disclose His character and nature
to us, we took Him and flung Him
on the cross and we made Him suf
fer and die.”
It is ordinary sin that crucified
Christ, sin seen today on the Stan
ford campus complacency, intel
lectual pride, unwillingness to be
shaken, moral compromise, fear of
facing the truth.
Christ’s death on the cross says
three things, Canon Green noted.

• “WHEN God in Christ con
fronted evil. Ho fought it to the
bitter end without compromise.
God hates sin—He won’t appease
it.” Thus, the sinner who is for
given by God must see the right
eousness of God and not take his
forgiveness lightly.

• “Forgive is the word of the
cross.” The love of God for sinful
man, the presence of a creative
mind of utter love is a concept
unique in Christianity. It is seen
in Christ suffering for man so that
He might bring man to God, “He
loved me and gave himself for
me.”
• The triumph of love is the fi
nal lesson of the cross, for this
event in history ends not with the
death, but with the resurrection of
Christ.
“THE LOVE of God I see in
Christ assures me He will forgive
mo, or to use the classical phrase,
justify me,” Canon Green said.
“By justification, I who am not
right with God am put right.”
“That I who be a sinner can be
come God's forgiven child —this is
the great heart of Christianity,”
Green stated.
It is not man’s own efforts, un
derstanding, or merit which bring
him to God. He must forget his ab
solute pride; he cannot do it alone.
“God paid the cost—He came down
himself.”
The teaching of Christianity,
Canon Green said, is, “If you come
as you are—and expose yourself
as far as you know yourself to be,
God answers.”

of God to bring man right with
Him. a search which is focused
in the event called Jesus Christ.
SPEARING LAST night in Me
morial Church, Green told his au
dience that Christ died because
man does not want God as God.
“We like Him as an idea, a kind of
parachute for escape,” Canon
Green said. “When God came to
disclose His character and nature
to us, we took Him and flung Him
on the cross and we made Him suf
fer and die.”
It is ordinary sin that crucified
Christ, sin seen today on the Stan
ford campus complacency, intel
lectual pride, unwillingness to be
shaken, moral compromise, fear of
facing the truth.
Christ’s death on the cross says
three things, Canon Green noted.

• “WHEN God in Christ con
fronted evil. Ho fought it to the
bitter end without compromise.
God hates sin—He won’t appease
it.” Thus, the sinner who is for
given by God must see the right
eousness of God and not take his
forgiveness lightly.

• “Forgive is the word of the
cross.” The love of God for sinful
man, the presence of a creative
mind of utter love is a concept
unique in Christianity. It is seen
in Christ suffering for man so that
He might bring man to God, “He
loved me and gave himself for
me.”
• The triumph of love is the fi
nal lesson of the cross, for this
event in history ends not with the
death, but with the resurrection of
Christ.
“THE LOVE of God I see in
Christ assures me He will forgive
mo, or to use the classical phrase,
justify me,” Canon Green said.
“By justification, I who am not
right with God am put right.”
“That I who be a sinner can be
come God's forgiven child —this is
the great heart of Christianity,”
Green stated.
It is not man’s own efforts, un
derstanding, or merit which bring
him to God. He must forget his ab
solute pride; he cannot do it alone.
“God paid the cost—He came down
himself.”
The teaching of Christianity,
Canon Green said, is, “If you come
as you are—and expose yourself
as far as you know yourself to be,
God answers.”
“The rebellion, the sin, the attitude of man crucified Christ. This
is your sin and my sin. 1 would have said, ‘Crucify,’ and so would
you. This is the human fact.’’
This is the meaning of the moral drama of Christ on the Cross
at Calvary as presented by Canon Bryan Green in the second part

of his lecture on the active seeking
of God to bring man right with
Him. a search which is focused
in the event called Jesus Christ.
