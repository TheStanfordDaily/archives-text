# Ginzton Explains Uses of Linear Accelerator

Prof. Edward Ginzton, head of
the micromave laboratory and a
director of Project M, the two-mile
linear accelerator scheduled for
completion on its Sand Hill site in
1967, explained the purpose and
operation of the accelerator in a
talk last night in the Physics Lec
ture Hall given to interested mem
bers of the Stanford community.

The machine will be involved in
elementary particle research. It
might be used to more accurately
define the dimensions of the vari
ous sub-atomic particles, in the
same manner as Prof. Holstadter
did in winning the Nobel Prize. It
might also add more sub-atomic
particles to the present list of
30.
THE TWO-MILE accelerator
will be able to do these things be
cause of its tremendous energy.
Machines in existence already
have only the power to light a 50-
watt bulb. Project M will have a
power of 50 million watts, and will
require one-tenth the power input
of the city of San Francisco.

Electrons will “ride” the high
frequency waves set up by multi
million-watt klystron tubes, much
as a surfboard rider “rides” ocean
waves, and, according to Einstein’s
relativity, will increase their mass
by a factor of 40.000.

Project M will employ about 750
persons, including 90 scientists, 12
permanent faculty members, 40
junior scientists or graduate stu
dents, and 20 scientists from other
parts of the world. The machine
will run 24 hours aday, seven days
a week at a cost of between SI 5
and $2O million a year. It will initi
ally cost about $125 million, more
than all present ccelerators com
bined.
THE PBOJEC T will be academ
ically integrated with the Univer
sity, but administratively sepa
rate.. Us basic policies will be con
trolled by a national committee
made up of a number of Stanford
people, as well as scientists from
other parts of the country.
The basic function of the proj
ect will be “to probe the unknown
and solve some of the mysteries of
the world in which we live.” As a
result of the project, said Ginzton,
“Stanford faculty and graduate
students may contribute signifi
cantly to the progress of science.”
