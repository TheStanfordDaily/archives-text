CL[l©©®Da <5 ° Why men watch girls
Men watch girls for various reasons. Personally, we need
no better reason than the reason men climb mountains.
They are there. We have heard old men say they watch
girls because it makes them feel younger and young
men because it makes them feel older (see above). While
investigating the reasons why men watch girls we picked
up a clue from, of all things, a bird watcher. He told us
that he formerly had been a flower watcher. Then one
day a Speckle-Breasted Jackdaw happened to land in
his garden as he was watching a calla lily and he noticed
that the bird moved. He switched to birds on the spot.
Girl watchers have discovered that girls enjoy this same
advantage (movement) over calla lilies. (Speaking of ad
vantages, how about Pall Mall's natural mildness!)
