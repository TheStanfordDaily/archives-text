# 'Mr. Sam' Is Dead; Country Mourns
## 
### 
BONHAM, Tex. ( UPI)—House Speaker Sam Rayburn, 79, died
peacefully in his sleep yesterday of cancer. He chose last spring to
ignore warning symptoms so lie could serve to the end a congres
sional career that spanned a half century.
President Kennedy led the nation, Republicans and Democrats

alike, in mourning “Mr. Demo
crat” as a great American. The
President and former President
Harry Truman will lead mourn
ers at the funeral tomorrow in
the town of Bonham, where Ray
burn started out 61 years ago
with $25 in his pocket and his
father’s blessing.
THE BODY of the man who
served longer as congressman
and as House Speaker than any
other man in history will lie in
state today at the Sam Rayburn
Library for 24 hours 10 a.m.
EST to 10 a.m. EST tomorrow
while officials gather for the
funeral tomorrow afternoon.
It was disclosed that he knew
he had cancer. Pie began to fail
in health last spring, lost weight
and appetite and in June and July
he had two moments of uncon
sciousness in the Speaker’s chair.
But he insisted on working for
the Kennedy “new frontier” pro
gram.
When he learned there was no
hope, that the cancer had gone
too far, he had only one com
ment: No flowers at the funeral.
THK DISEASE spread through
his body and into the brain, caus
ing failure of the respiratory sys
tem and a calm, painless end.
The funeral will be held at 2:30
p.m., EST, tomorrow. President
Kennedy will interrupt a western
speaking tour and fly to Bonham
to attend. Vice President Lyndon
B. Johnson hurried to Bonham by
plane and helicopter.
Johnson flew to Bonham in late
afternoon to comfort the grieved
family of Rayburn. He spent 30
minutes at Rayburn’s white co
lonial home just west of the Bon
ham city limits. In an earlier
statement, Johnson said in Ray
burn’s death “the good people of
the world have lost a companion
and an ally.” He said “the capi
tol is a very lonely place without
him.”

BONHAM, Tex. ( UPI)—House Speaker Sam Rayburn, 79, died
peacefully in his sleep yesterday of cancer. He chose last spring to
ignore warning symptoms so lie could serve to the end a congres
sional career that spanned a half century.
President Kennedy led the nation, Republicans and Democrats

alike, in mourning “Mr. Demo
crat” as a great American. The
President and former President
Harry Truman will lead mourn
ers at the funeral tomorrow in
the town of Bonham, where Ray
burn started out 61 years ago
with $25 in his pocket and his
father’s blessing.
THE BODY of the man who
served longer as congressman
and as House Speaker than any
other man in history will lie in
state today at the Sam Rayburn
Library for 24 hours 10 a.m.
EST to 10 a.m. EST tomorrow
while officials gather for the
funeral tomorrow afternoon.
It was disclosed that he knew
he had cancer. Pie began to fail
in health last spring, lost weight
and appetite and in June and July
he had two moments of uncon
sciousness in the Speaker’s chair.
But he insisted on working for
the Kennedy “new frontier” pro
gram.
When he learned there was no
hope, that the cancer had gone
too far, he had only one com
ment: No flowers at the funeral.
THK DISEASE spread through
his body and into the brain, caus
ing failure of the respiratory sys
tem and a calm, painless end.
The funeral will be held at 2:30
