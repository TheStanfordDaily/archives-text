# 'Row Romp' To Roll Tonight
## 
### 
Tribal rites will be held to
night from 8 to 12 in front of
the SAE House. The rites, en
titled “Row Romp,” include
dancing in the street and “mu
sic” by the Lancers, sponsor
ed by the Class of ’63.
Dean Banks, the dance
chairman said, “This affair is
definitely an all-campus func
tion, and we would like to im
press upon everyone to come,
either stag or with a date.”
“For those girls who are not
doing anything Friday eve
ning,” Banks said, “we can
only say from experience that
there will he a plentiful supply
of guys on hand; so thwart
your inhibitions and come out
to the street dance.”
“Since the weather has been
somewhat chilly the past few
eves, instant heat will bo pro
vided. As for refreshments,
we think toasted marshmal
lows might serve the pur
pose.”
