# Medical Students in A Laudable Effort
## 
### 
A group of medical students and anyone else on campus inter
ested will meet at noon today to discuss the general drift of world
affairs and its nuclear overtones. Across the country in Ithaca, New
York, a similar meeting and discussion will take place, on a some
what larger scale. As reported Wednesday, the Cornell faculty will
devote class time to discussing the world situation and will take
part with students in a mass meeting later this afternoon.
While we would have liked to have seen more done at Stanford,
we realize time was short and no one in particular wanted to organ
ize such a program. We are not surprised that nothing large will
happen here today, but we do think the efforts of the medical stu
dents are praiseworthy.
In these days of fanatical “Minutemen,”“Christian Anti-Commu
nist" crusaders and their ilk who would destroy this country if then
ideas were accepted, it is refreshing to see a group gather which
can’t honestly be labeled with a “pacifist,” “Communist” or other
similar tag, but which is simply interested and concerned enough
to discuss such things as nuclear testing and the arms race.
Perhaps faculty who wish to do so could devote their class time
today to such a discussion, or students might request this, even if no
campus-wide effort can be made.
At any rate, it is commendable that a real interest is being dem
onstrated around the country lately in discussing the future of the
world—intelligently. Intelligent, personal discussion is a commodity
not found too often in the world of 1961.
