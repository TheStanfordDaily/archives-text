## Russ Film Director S.F. Festival s Best Asset 
### DEREK DAVIS Daily Staff Writer 
In many of its aspects, the San
Francisco Film Festival had all
the organization of a street brawl.
Those of us from Stanford who
had been given the privilege of a
pet’s eye view of the proceedings
often found ourselves drifting
along with only a vague notion of
where we were headed and not al
ways quite clear on where we had
been.

Thus one of its sanest and most
instructive moments came more
or less by accident. When some
half a dozen of us appeared at the
Shcraton-Palace for a Sunday di
rectors’ conference which never
materialized, it began to look like
the nadir of a week the chief prod
uct of which had been eyestrain.
But it was soon found that Lev
Arnstam, a leading Russian direc
tor and powerful force in the huge
Mosfilm studios, was free for the
time being and would be more
than happy to talk to a group of
college students interested in film.
SEATED INFORMALLY on the
twin beds in Festival-director Ir
ving Levin’s Palace room, wo wore
treated for an hour and a half to
the comments of a man whose
charm and insight showed in every
phrase ho uttered, even though his
words (and ours) were necessarily
filtered through the slight young
girl serving as his interpreter.
The Russian film industry,
judging from Mr. Arnstam’s ac
count, is organized along lines
much more agreeable to the cre
ation of an artistic product than is
our helter-skelter of Hollywood
bedlam.
Directors go through the Insti
tute of Cinematography, turning
out a full length feature for a mas
ter’s thesis and going immediately
into professional production,
where their initial works are fa
thered and guided by such old
hands as Arnstam himself. The ac
cent is on youth, with a large
group of competent young direc
tors already formed.

In almost utter disregard for the
star system, Mosfilm puts all roles
up for grabs, usually having four
or five actors audition. A hard
coi’e of only 300-400 film actors is
maintained, leaving much room
for the non-actor and for the use
of Moscow stage personalities.

AN ARTISTIC Council (of
which Arnstam is a member)
makes the final choices on the ba
sis of those auditions, in an at
tempt to rule out personal favorit
ism, even on the part of the direc
tor. The result is an extraordinary
level of natural acting ability, as

shown in both Festival entries this
year, and in such past films as
“Ballad of a Soldier.”
Pacing around the room while
Ins interpreter translated his earli
er remarks, Arnstam, a short,
stocky, balding man bearing a
striking physical resemblance to
Premier Khrushchev, had time to
develop several penetrating gener
alizations based on films shown at
the Festival.

Commenting on an American
entry, “Exiles,” a documentary ac
count of life among a colony of
Indians in Los Angeles, he noted
that the harsh realities of modern
life and the uncertain position of
the rising generation has led many
young film makers to drop the ar
tifact of story-line in in favor of a
faithful cataloguing of man’s real
surroundings.
THIS, Arnstam feels, is an ex
cellent direction to take, and has
engendered an approach of excep
tional honesty and truth. On the
other hand, it is only a beginning.
The shucking of all pretense and
the dwelling on the sordid side of
life, so long neglected, cannot be
left undeveloped, for it does not
tell the whole truth. “Exiles,” for
example, gives a stirring account
of the Indians’ lack of orientation
and inability to fit into the new
culture, but we do not see why
they fail to fit effect without
cause.

Arnstam himself is a man who
is concerned with the good in life.
While labelling himself a materi
alist and an atheist and agreeing
with the anti-Catholic sentiments
of Luis Bunuel’s Spanish entry

“Viridianna,” he feels that Eunu
chs conclusion, seemingly repudi
ating the possibility of practicing
any sort of good, has a negative
quality which he has never been
able to accept. He would rather
point up the good in the worst of
us. than the evil in the best of us.

BUT the most impressive thing
about Arnstam in the eyes of his
small but attentive filmic audience
was his immense, unrestrained
friendliness. “I like talking to
young people,” he said, expressing
real regret that he could not come
to Stanford for a day, as he had
originally planned.
That evening he pushed his way
through the multilingual crowd
assembled for the premiers of “An
tigone” and the UAR spectacular,
to shake hands with two of us and,
devoid of interpreter, painfully
ask: “Mexican—good film?” As it
so happened, the Mexican film was
good (winning the Festival’s top
award),- but Arnstam himself
struck home as the Festival’s sin
gle most valuable asset.
