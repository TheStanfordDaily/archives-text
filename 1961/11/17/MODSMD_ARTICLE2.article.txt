# LASSU OKs WUS Plan
## 
### JERRY RANKIN Editor 
Legislature last night endorsed
and gave its full backing to the
current World University Service
drive in its second straight speedy
50-minute session.
LASSU unanimously approved
a WUS request to solicit funds at
the Sunday Flick through a recep
tacle placed in the Mem And lobby,
and then formally voiced its sup v
port of the drive.
In other action on the short
agenda, Legislature approved the
selection of two new sophomore
representatives to LASSU, as re
quired by the votersâ€™ approval of
the constitutional amendment
passed at the recent fall election.
Representing the Class of '64 on
LASSU will be Larry Kurtzon for
the men, and Stevie Aden for the
women. They were selected by the
sophomore ex-com with the ap
proval of ASSU President Bob
Sayler.
