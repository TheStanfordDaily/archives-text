### 
WASHINGTON (UPIK His big
House chair draped in black,
Speaker Sam Rayburn was
mourned yesterday by fellow
Americans ranging from a Texas
fishing companion to the U.S. pres
idents he served during a half cen
tury in public life.
President Kennedy was joined
by the nation’s living ex-Presi
dents—Eisenhower, Truman, Hoo
ver—in paying tribute to “a loyal
counselor,” “a distinguished Amer
ican,” “one of America’s great
leaders,” and “the greatest of the
great speakers.”
SAID KENNEDY:

“I had singular opportunity as
a young congressman, and now
more recently as President, to ap
preciate his temperament and his
character. Both were bedded in
rock and remained unchanged by
circumstance.”

In Bonham, Tex., postman Joe
Kincaid said:
“I went fishing with him some.
As a fisherman, I’d say he was
pretty good. As a man, he was as
good as they come.”
In the U.S. House of Represen
tatives, the men who worked daily
with the granite-like speaker
draped his brown leather chair in
black, placed a wreath of yellow
chrysanthemums on his desk and

laid his gavel, the symbol of his
power, atop the flowers.
The flag flying from the Capi
tol’s newly extended east front
when he died at 4:20 a.m. PST was
taken down. It will be presented
to his family.
MANY OF the hundreds who is
sued public statements of sorrow
spoke of the Democratic speak
er’s fairness while serving as pre
siding officer of the House more
than twice as long as any other
man. Among those was Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
“Because I was born in his con
gressional district, he often re
ferred to me as a “vicarious con
stituent’,” the Republican ex-Pres
idont said. “He was a forceful lead
er, fair-minded and deeply versed
in public affairs, respected by both
political parties, accustomed to
distinction, yet in mind and heart
identified with the ordinary citi
zen.”
Harry S. Truman called Ray
burn his “good friend” and added:
“Say Rayburn was a statesman.
When history is written he will ap
pear as one of the very great men
of this period.”
Former President Herbert Hoo
ver said Rayburn “commanded
both affection and respect irre
spective of political affiliations.”

House chair draped in black,
Speaker Sam Rayburn was
mourned yesterday by fellow
Americans ranging from a Texas
fishing companion to the U.S. pres
idents he served during a half cen
tury in public life.
President Kennedy was joined
by the nation’s living ex-Presi
dents—Eisenhower, Truman, Hoo
ver—in paying tribute to “a loyal
counselor,” “a distinguished Amer
ican,” “one of America’s great
leaders,” and “the greatest of the
great speakers.”
SAID KENNEDY:

“I had singular opportunity as
a young congressman, and now
more recently as President, to ap
preciate his temperament and his
character. Both were bedded in
rock and remained unchanged by
circumstance.”

In Bonham, Tex., postman Joe
Kincaid said:
“I went fishing with him some.
As a fisherman, I’d say he was
pretty good. As a man, he was as
good as they come.”
In the U.S. House of Represen
tatives, the men who worked daily
with the granite-like speaker
draped his brown leather chair in
black, placed a wreath of yellow
chrysanthemums on his desk and

laid his gavel, the symbol of his
power, atop the flowers.
The flag flying from the Capi
tol’s newly extended east front
when he died at 4:20 a.m. PST was
taken down. It will be presented
to his family.
MANY OF the hundreds who is
sued public statements of sorrow
spoke of the Democratic speak
er’s fairness while serving as pre
siding officer of the House more
than twice as long as any other
man. Among those was Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
“Because I was born in his con
gressional district, he often re
ferred to me as a “vicarious con
stituent’,” the Republican ex-Pres
idont said. “He was a forceful lead
er, fair-minded and deeply versed
in public affairs, respected by both
political parties, accustomed to
distinction, yet in mind and heart
identified with the ordinary citi
zen.”
Harry S. Truman called Ray
burn his “good friend” and added:
“Say Rayburn was a statesman.
When history is written he will ap
pear as one of the very great men
of this period.”
Former President Herbert Hoo
ver said Rayburn “commanded
both affection and respect irre
spective of political affiliations.”
