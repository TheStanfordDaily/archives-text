### 
MOSCOW (UPI) A mob of
1,000 African students threw
stones and bottles at the French
embassy yesterday in a howling
protest against French Algerian
policy. Soviet troops and police
kept the demonstrators from en
tering the embassy building.
About 100 policemen and 100 in
fantrymen called out from the
Moscow garrison pushed the mob
back from the embassy doors. But
the screaming demonstrators, who
included a sprinkling of Soviet
students, shattered most of the
double plate glass windows on the
ground floor and threw ink and
milk bottles.
