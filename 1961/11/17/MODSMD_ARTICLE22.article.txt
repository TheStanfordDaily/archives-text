## On Fallout Shelters 
### 
The fear and bewilderment
which enshroud the business of
fallout shelters are threatening to
corrupt the morale of our people.
The evil comes from telling them
that they are in danger of being
exterminated, and that they can
and should save themselves sep
arately, each family for itself, and
the devil take the hindmost.
This is the way to brood panic.
It is like telling the passengers
of a ship that the ship may sink
and that while there are not
enough life preservers for every
one, each man should try to make
one for himself.
Let us find out if we can how we
got into this mess and how we can
get out of it.
The record shows clearly, it
seems to me, that the trouble was
caused by what the President said
about shelters in the address of
July 25, dealing with the Berlin
crisis. The popular excitement and
interest in shelters date from that
address. For in it the nation was
told, or at least encouraged to be
lieve, that at Vienna in June
Khrushchev had delivered a six
months ultimatum to Kennedy,
and that since we rejected that ul
timatum firmly, a thermonuclear
war was quite possible by the end
of December.
IT WAS IN this context that the
President told the people that in
the coming months he would let
every citizen know what steps he
could "take without delay to pro
tect his family in case of attack.”
It was a very bad mistake to tie
together the six months deadline
about Berlin with a call for imme
diate action to each citizen to save
his family. For the fact is that no
serious program of fallout shel
ters can conceivably be carried out
in six months by private initiative.
But being told to try it has fright
ened people without doing any
thing to save them.

That the impression conveyed
by the address of July 25 was a
mistake is evident from the fact
that only two months earlier, in
the President’s Special Message of
May 25, he had expounded the con
cept of civil defense coolly, clear
ly, and exactly. In view of the state
of mind which now prevails in the
country, what he said then is
worth quoting at length.

“THIS Administration has been
looking very hard at exactly what
civil defense can and cannot do.
It cannot be obtained cheaply. It
cannot give an assurance of blast
protection that will be proof
against surprise attack or guaran
teed against obsolescence or de
struction. And it cannot deter a
nuclear attack.
“We will deter an enemy from
making a nuclear attack only if
our retaliatory power is so strong
and so invulnerable that he knows
he would be destroyed by our re
sponse. If we have that strength,
civil defense is not needed to deter
an attack. If we should ever lack
it, civil defense would not be an
adequate substitute.
“But this deterrent concept as
sumes rational calculations by ra
tional men. And the history of this
planet is sufficient to remind us of
the possibilities of an irrational at
tack, a miscalculation, an acci
dental war which cannot be either
foreseen or deterred. The nature
of modern warfare heightens
these possibilities. It is on this ba
sis that civil defense can readily
be justified—as insurance for the
civilian population in the event of

such miscalculation. It is insur
ance we trust will never be needed
but insurance which we could
never forgive ourselves for fore
going in the event of catastrophe.

"ONCE THE validity of this
concept is recognized, there is no
point in delaying the initiation of
a nationwide long-range program
of identifying present fallout shel
ter capacity and providing shelter
in new and existing structures.
Such a program would protect mil
lions of people against the hazards
of radioactive fallout in the event
of a large-scale nuclear attack. To
assure effective use of these shel
ters, additional measures will be
required for warning, training,
radiological monitoring, and
stockpiling of food and medicines.
And effective performance of the
entire program requires not only
new legislative authority and
more funds, but also sound organi
zational arrangements.”
The crucial difference between

May 25 and July 25 is this. Before
his encounter with Khrushchev in
Vienna, the President saw clearly
and said clearly that a serious shel
ter policy would have to be “a long
range program,” that is could not
be cheap, and that it would require
new planning and new organiza
tion.

On July 25 he gave the impres
sion, though his exact words do
not say so. that a shelter program
could be carried out as an emer
gency measure against the six
months ultimatum.

IT IS THE treatment of the pol
icy on shelters as an emergency
measure which has caused all the
trouble. Why this policy as an
emergency measure was decided
upon between the month of June
and the last week of July is a ques
tion we shall have to leave to the
historians. What we have to do
now, however, is clear enough. We
have to return to the policy and
doctrine of the message of May
25, and the sooner this is done, the
better.

The mesage of May 25 lays down
two propositions. The first is that
our only true defense against nu
clear attack is to maintain at all
costs a retaliatory power “so
strong and so invulnerable” that
an aggressor would be destroyed
even if he made the first attack.

The second proposition is that
since the first proposition “as
sumes rational calculations by ra
tional men,” we have to protect
ourselves also against irrational
calculations by irrational men. It
is against this not against the Ber
lin crisis and not against deliberate
aggression but against irrationali
ty, that we should build shelters
in a long-range program.
THIS SECOND proposition can
usefully, I think, be developed
somewhat further. The main dan
ger of an irrational war is that one
of the other of the nuclear powers
will find itself in a dead-end street
from which there is no exit except
by surrender or mutual suicide.

One of the nuclear powers could
maneuver the other nuclear power
into a position that amounts to in
tolerable provocation. Or one of
the nuclear powers could maneu
ver itself into the dead-end street
by making impossible demands
from which it was unable to re
cede without humiliating loss of
face. These are the situations
which could easily enough, even in
this democracy, engender irration
al actions by mass pressures of
people who had lost their heads.
It is the business of diplomacy
to avoid getting into and to avoid
getting the other side into the
dead-end street. This is the nuclear
age, and in the nuclear age war
cannot be employed by diplomacy
as an instrument of national pol
icy. Until the nuclear age, which
began only about 10 years ago, a
government could, as George
Washington said, “choose peace
or war, as our interest guided by
justice, shall counsel.”
This is no longer possible as be
tween nuclear powers. They can
not choose war, and therefore the
national interest has to be pro
moted and defended by other
means. As between contending nu
clear powers, nuclear weapons can

be used only to neutralize other
nuclear weapons.
