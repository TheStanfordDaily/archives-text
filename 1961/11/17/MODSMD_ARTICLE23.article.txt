CLEAN CAMPUS
Editor, The Daily:
As co-chairman of the “Clean
tire Campus” campaign I would
like to say that I have noticed fa
vorable results in many areas on
campus.
Whether this is duo to student
or University efforts it is hard to
say, but I certainly hope that it is
due to the efforts of Stanford stu
dents. There are still a few places
on campus which seemed unaffect
ed by the campaign. The main area
which I refer to is the Cellar and
its vicinity.

It is hard to tell students that
they should go around campus and
pick up litter that has been thrown
by other students, but I don’t think
it is too much to ask each student
to wait until he gets to a trash con
tainer to deposit his own litter.
I would like to thank The Daily
for its articles and the University
for its cooperation in this cam
paign.

BIG GAME STUNT
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations, Stanford! It
warms our hearts, as it must
warm those of all true Stanford
students, to hear that we have
gained such a “major psychologi
cal victory over Cal.”
We are glad to know that Stan
ford engineers have put their
knowledge to such creative and
noble use. Nobel Prizes should be
forthcoming. Those who fear that
Stanford students are absorbing
too many abstract theories and
ideas will doubtless be reassured
by the knowledge that these the
ories and ideas can be so practical
ly applied.
The impact that this brilliant en
deavor must have made on the Cal
student body virtually assures
Stanford of a victory in the up
coming athletic contest, so crucial
to all students.

Who will ever forget such an im
portant event, so characteristic of
Stanford engineering genius? We
are confident that, as long as such
glorious inspiration as the Big
Game continues to exist, originali
ty and creativity will never die at
Stanford.

U.S. VALUES
Editor, The Daily:
This is in response to Mr. Bar
num’s letter in Monday’s Daily, in
which he asserts that the United
States cannot “legitimately base a
resumption (of nuclear testing)
decision on personal considera
tions.” He asks, “Why is it that
what is right for the United States
is right—period?”

I believe this illustrates a basic
weakness in present American po
litical belief that fact that our
values are so vague and doubted
that we feel we have no other genu
ine basis for any decision besides
personal considerations.

Ideologically, it is perhaps true
that the United States has no right
to feel that its views are any more
right than any other.
That so many Americans have
come to this conclusion is probably
due to our liberal and questioning
tradition which has led some to be-

lieve that nobody has any justifi
cation to compare values, because
there are no certain standards by
which to judge. Despite the fact
that I am one of those who so be
lieve, I feel that the widespread
presence of this opinion is a weak
ness in any society. What Mr. Bar
num suggests, really, is that our
values, or any values, are too weak
to fight for.

It is my opinion that most things
in this world, regardless of their
external appearances, are done in
self interest and not for universal
brotherhood and progress; I also
believe that a society or world
composed of people who think as
I do would be insane and tragic.
(That is not to say that I think I
am insane and tragic.)
The United States needs a re
birth, a tradition, a belief. Whether
i( will ever get it, 1 don’t know;
Moral Re-Armament and the John
Birch Society appear to be pretty
weak attempts.
In the meantime, though. I say
to Mr. Barnum that as long as we
are committed to the game of life,
which we apparently are, as our
society frowns on suicide, we
might as well play to win, al
though we may lose: for other
wise, we arc sure to lose.

UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT
Editor, Tile Daily:
If Mr. Randy Gallistel is sincere
in his article published under
“Campus Opinion” in the Nov. 15
Daily he is either an incredible
fool, sadly misinformed or in the
pay of the Soviet Union. It would
be more pleasant to assume the
last mentioned possibility for one
could then ignore Mr. Gallistel un
der the assumption that the Jus
tice Department would, in time,
remove the annoyance.
But I fear, his opinion may well
be typical of the half-baked under-

graduate thinking going on at
Stanford today.

If Mr. Gallistel had taken the
trouble to inform himself on some
of the events of recent history
rather than consuming newspaper
accounts of French brutality in
Algeria he would realize that his
ideas are neither new nor practi
cal.

The policy of isolationism which
he advocates under the title of
“unilateral disarmament” was in
vogue both here and in Great Brit
ain before the Second World War.

In those days they called it
“Peace in our times.” Indeed the
Hon. Joseph Kennedy, then ambas
sador to the Court of St. James,
advocated letting Nazi Germany
and Soviet Russia destroy one an
other, under the assumption that
they would.

Needless to say, they got to
gether and divided up their
spheres of influence and it was not
until Germany had been frustrat
ed in the Battle of Britain, not, that
is, by guerrilla forces, but by the
full power of the RAF that she
turned upon Russia.

Were wo to abandon our obliga
tions as Mr. Gallistel would have
us do. Russia and China could
easily divide the world between
themselves, after which we may be
sure, they would be too busy con
quering us all, guerrillas or not,
to fight one another.
Until bilateral, inspected and
controlled disarmament can be
achieved we must remain true to
the principle that “eternal vigi
lance is the price of freedom.”

U.S. VALUES
Editor, The Daily:
This is in response to Mr. Bar
num’s letter in Monday’s Daily, in
which he asserts that the United
States cannot “legitimately base a
resumption (of nuclear testing)
decision on personal considera
tions.” He asks, “Why is it that
what is right for the United States
is right—period?”

I believe this illustrates a basic
weakness in present American po
litical belief that fact that our
values are so vague and doubted
that we feel we have no other genu
ine basis for any decision besides
personal considerations.

Ideologically, it is perhaps true
that the United States has no right
to feel that its views are any more
right than any other.
That so many Americans have
come to this conclusion is probably
due to our liberal and questioning
tradition which has led some to be-

lieve that nobody has any justifi
cation to compare values, because
there are no certain standards by
which to judge. Despite the fact
that I am one of those who so be
lieve, I feel that the widespread
presence of this opinion is a weak
ness in any society. What Mr. Bar
num suggests, really, is that our
values, or any values, are too weak
to fight for.

It is my opinion that most things
in this world, regardless of their
external appearances, are done in
self interest and not for universal
brotherhood and progress; I also
believe that a society or world
composed of people who think as
I do would be insane and tragic.
(That is not to say that I think I
am insane and tragic.)
The United States needs a re
birth, a tradition, a belief. Whether
i( will ever get it, 1 don’t know;
Moral Re-Armament and the John
Birch Society appear to be pretty
weak attempts.
In the meantime, though. I say
to Mr. Barnum that as long as we
are committed to the game of life,
which we apparently are, as our
society frowns on suicide, we
might as well play to win, al
though we may lose: for other
wise, we arc sure to lose.

UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT
Editor, Tile Daily:
If Mr. Randy Gallistel is sincere
in his article published under
“Campus Opinion” in the Nov. 15
Daily he is either an incredible
fool, sadly misinformed or in the
pay of the Soviet Union. It would
be more pleasant to assume the
last mentioned possibility for one
could then ignore Mr. Gallistel un
der the assumption that the Jus
tice Department would, in time,
remove the annoyance.
But I fear, his opinion may well
be typical of the half-baked under-

graduate thinking going on at
Stanford today.

If Mr. Gallistel had taken the
trouble to inform himself on some
of the events of recent history
rather than consuming newspaper
accounts of French brutality in
Algeria he would realize that his
ideas are neither new nor practi
cal.

The policy of isolationism which
he advocates under the title of
“unilateral disarmament” was in
vogue both here and in Great Brit
ain before the Second World War.

In those days they called it
“Peace in our times.” Indeed the
Hon. Joseph Kennedy, then ambas
sador to the Court of St. James,
advocated letting Nazi Germany
and Soviet Russia destroy one an
other, under the assumption that
they would.

Needless to say, they got to
gether and divided up their
spheres of influence and it was not
until Germany had been frustrat
ed in the Battle of Britain, not, that
is, by guerrilla forces, but by the
full power of the RAF that she
turned upon Russia.

Were wo to abandon our obliga
tions as Mr. Gallistel would have
us do. Russia and China could
easily divide the world between
themselves, after which we may be
sure, they would be too busy con
quering us all, guerrillas or not,
to fight one another.
Until bilateral, inspected and
controlled disarmament can be
achieved we must remain true to
the principle that “eternal vigi
lance is the price of freedom.”

CLEAN CAMPUS
Editor, The Daily:
As co-chairman of the “Clean

like to say that I have noticed fa
vorable results in many areas on
campus.
Whether this is duo to student

due to the efforts of Stanford stu

on campus which seemed unaffect

which I refer to is the Cellar and
its vicinity.

It is hard to tell students that
they should go around campus and
pick up litter that has been thrown
by other students, but I don’t think
it is too much to ask each student
to wait until he gets to a trash con
tainer to deposit his own litter.

The United States needs a re

Moral Re-Armament and the John

In the meantime, though. I say

UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT
Editor, Tile Daily:
If Mr. Randy Gallistel is sincere
in his article published under
“Campus Opinion” in the Nov. 15
Daily he is either an incredible
fool, sadly misinformed or in the
pay of the Soviet Union. It would
be more pleasant to assume the
last mentioned possibility for one
could then ignore Mr. Gallistel un
der the assumption that the Jus
tice Department would, in time,
remove the annoyance.
But I fear, his opinion may well
be typical of the half-baked under-

graduate thinking going on at
Stanford today.

If Mr. Gallistel had taken the
trouble to inform himself on some
of the events of recent history
rather than consuming newspaper
accounts of French brutality in
Algeria he would realize that his
ideas are neither new nor practi
cal.

The policy of isolationism which
he advocates under the title of
“unilateral disarmament” was in
vogue both here and in Great Brit
ain before the Second World War.

In those days they called it
“Peace in our times.” Indeed the
Hon. Joseph Kennedy, then ambas
sador to the Court of St. James,
advocated letting Nazi Germany
and Soviet Russia destroy one an
other, under the assumption that
they would.

Needless to say, they got to
gether and divided up their
spheres of influence and it was not
until Germany had been frustrat
ed in the Battle of Britain, not, that
is, by guerrilla forces, but by the
full power of the RAF that she
turned upon Russia.

Were wo to abandon our obliga
tions as Mr. Gallistel would have
us do. Russia and China could
easily divide the world between
themselves, after which we may be
sure, they would be too busy con
quering us all, guerrillas or not,
to fight one another.
Until bilateral, inspected and
controlled disarmament can be
achieved we must remain true to
the principle that “eternal vigi
lance is the price of freedom.”

CLEAN CAMPUS
Editor, The Daily:
As co-chairman of the “Clean
tire Campus” campaign I would
like to say that I have noticed fa
vorable results in many areas on
campus.
Whether this is duo to student
or University efforts it is hard to
say, but I certainly hope that it is
due to the efforts of Stanford stu
dents. There are still a few places
on campus which seemed unaffect
ed by the campaign. The main area
which I refer to is the Cellar and
its vicinity.

It is hard to tell students that
they should go around campus and
pick up litter that has been thrown
by other students, but I don’t think
it is too much to ask each student
to wait until he gets to a trash con
tainer to deposit his own litter.
I would like to thank The Daily

BIG GAME STUNT
Editor, The Daily:
Congratulations, Stanford! It

students, to hear that we have
gained such a “major psychologi

We are glad to know that Stan
ford engineers have put their
knowledge to such creative and
noble use. Nobel Prizes should be
forthcoming. Those who fear that
Stanford students are absorbing
too many abstract theories and
ideas will doubtless be reassured
by the knowledge that these the
ories and ideas can be so practical
ly applied.
The impact that this brilliant en
deavor must have made on the Cal
student body virtually assures
Stanford of a victory in the up
coming athletic contest, so crucial
to all students.

Who will ever forget such an im
portant event, so characteristic of
Stanford engineering genius? We
are confident that, as long as such
glorious inspiration as the Big

to Mr. Barnum that as long as we
are committed to the game of life,
which we apparently are, as our
society frowns on suicide, we
might as well play to win, al
though we may lose: for other
wise, we arc sure to lose.

UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT
Editor, Tile Daily:
If Mr. Randy Gallistel is sincere
in his article published under
“Campus Opinion” in the Nov. 15
Daily he is either an incredible
fool, sadly misinformed or in the
pay of the Soviet Union. It would
be more pleasant to assume the
last mentioned possibility for one
could then ignore Mr. Gallistel un
der the assumption that the Jus
tice Department would, in time,
remove the annoyance.
But I fear, his opinion may well
be typical of the half-baked under-

graduate thinking going on at
Stanford today.

If Mr. Gallistel had taken the
trouble to inform himself on some
of the events of recent history
rather than consuming newspaper
accounts of French brutality in
Algeria he would realize that his
ideas are neither new nor practi
cal.

The policy of isolationism which
he advocates under the title of
“unilateral disarmament” was in
vogue both here and in Great Brit
ain before the Second World War.

In those days they called it
“Peace in our times.” Indeed the
Hon. Joseph Kennedy, then ambas
sador to the Court of St. James,
advocated letting Nazi Germany
and Soviet Russia destroy one an
other, under the assumption that
they would.

Needless to say, they got to
gether and divided up their
spheres of influence and it was not
until Germany had been frustrat
ed in the Battle of Britain, not, that
is, by guerrilla forces, but by the
full power of the RAF that she
turned upon Russia.

Were wo to abandon our obliga
tions as Mr. Gallistel would have
us do. Russia and China could
easily divide the world between
themselves, after which we may be
sure, they would be too busy con
quering us all, guerrillas or not,
to fight one another.
Until bilateral, inspected and
controlled disarmament can be
achieved we must remain true to
the principle that “eternal vigi
lance is the price of freedom.”
