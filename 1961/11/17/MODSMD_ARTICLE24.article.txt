# Stanford Poloists to Oppose Golden Bears In Televised Match
## 
### PETE KING 
Tomorrow is Big Game clay for the Stanford varsity water polo
team, when the Indians face the Cal Bears at 10 a.m. in the Stan
ford pool. The Bears have lost only one game to collegiate compe
tition this year, and Stanford coach Jim Gaughran expects a close

and hard-fought game.
The game will be taped by tele
vision station KTVU, the first live
coverage of a Stanford home game
this season, and broadcast at 2
p.m. tomorrow.
IN THE ONLY other clash be
tween the two teams this year, the
Bears beat Stanford, 8-3, in a con
test much closer than the score in
dicates. The game tomorrow will
decide the Big Five water polo
champion. Cal needs a victory to
tie for the title, while a Stanford
win would move the Cards up to
third place.
Among the probable starters for
the Indians is sophomore Pete Pet
tigrew, (he team’s top scorer with
34 goals. Coach Gaughran rates
him as the most improved player
on the squad. Other outstanding
players are senior Bob Spence,
team captain and second highest
scorer, and Don Buehler, whom
Gaughran describes as “a real
powerhouse and one of our best
hustlers.”

Bulwarking the Indian defense
will be John Bates, all-AAWU
goalie last season. Other players
who will see action are forwards
Bill and Boh Lorton, George Har
rison, Mike Conn, and Boh Far
rell.
BIG THREATS for the Golden
Bears are Rich Stewart, finest Cal
player, and John Montgomery,
who made (he all-coast team last
year.
Although Cal is favored, Gaugh
ran is confident that the Indians
can pull an upset. “We’re just as
good as they are,” he remarked,
“and with some real hustle we’ll
win.” The Olympic Club beat Cal,
19-o, recently, so the Bears aren’t
invincible.
Gaughran also mentioned that
the television broadcast would
make the players try harder and
would intensify the competition a
great deal. He said that a good
student turnout for the game
would really boost the Indians’
spirit.
