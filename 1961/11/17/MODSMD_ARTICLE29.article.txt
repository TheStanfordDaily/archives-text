time yardage yesterday to high
light mural football action.

point was added on a Tippett to
Phil Levene pass.

THK PHI DELT score resulted
from a 5-yard pass from Bunny
Kraemer to George Mollett. Hap
py Klopp ran over the important
conversion.

Breakers never threatened after
their touchdown. Backficld work
by Klopp and Bi Kluth were big
factors in the Phil Delt defense.
The winners almost took the
game without the playoff. They
threatened twice late in (he game.
A Bunny Kraemer pass to Larry
Gooch put the ball on the 15, and
running by Klopp put the ball
close to the goal, but Breakers held
on their 5.

THERE WAS only ono play left
n the game, and Tippett threw

long to try and win it, but his pass
was intercepted and run back to
the two-yard line. Only a diving
tackle saved the game. After the
interception, time ran out.
In the overtime, Steve Rose’s de
fensive heroics wrapped up the
game for Phi Delts. He nailed Tip
pett for a nine-yard loss. The
Breakers ended up with a loss of
five yards in the overtime.
Runs by Kraemer and Klopp
gave the Phi Delts plenty of yard
age to ice the game. Klopp gained
12 yards on his first rush and
Kraemer added 20 more.

LOS ARCOS pulled an upset of
sorts, beating the ATO I with a
12-0 shutout. Arcos was the top
Eating Club team, but the ATO’s
were voted the most improved
team in the intramural football
league this week.
Arcos was led by Chuck Good
win, who threw touchdown passes
to Jack Mayer and Frank Wallace.
