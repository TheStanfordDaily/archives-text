# Old JFK Foe M'Cormack to Lead House
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD - The
heir-apparent to Sam Rayburn’s
cloak of congressional leadership
is a veteran Massachusetts Demo
crat with whom President Ken
nedy has been crossing swords
for more than a dozen years.
He is 69-year-old Rep, John W.
McCormack, his party’s No. 2
man in the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives for a record-breaking
21 years.
McCormack is not the most
popular man in the House, but
all indications are that his col
leagues will elect him in January
to succeed Rayburn, who died
yesterday.
REP. CARL ALBERT, 53, of
Oklahoma, appeared to have the
inside track for the post of Demo
cratic Floor Leader.
There is no doubt that Kenne
dy’s legislative program will suf
fer from the change in leadership.
The House nowadays is far more
conservative than the Senate. And
neither McCormack nor any other
possible succesor could wield the
pow'er Rayburn had.

The President and McCormack
probably will agree on most 1962
legislative issues except taxes and
education.

AS HOUSE Democratic Leader,
McCormack has shown no enthus
iasm for Kennedy’s proposal to
cut corporate taxes to encourage
investment. Likewise, McCormack
opposes Kennedy’s proposal to
extend federal aid to public
schools before considering any
aid plan for parochial schools.
Some Democrats blamed McCor
mack for defeat of Kennedy’s
school aid bill in the last session.

Although both are Irish Catho
lics from Boston, Kennedy and
McCormack come from diametri
cally opposed backgrounds.
