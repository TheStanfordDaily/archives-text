# Stanford Indians Will Host Rejuvenated Washington St.
## 
### RON KAPOPORT 
In 1959, Jack Curtice coached
Stanford’s football team to three
wins. The year before that, Cur
tice’s first year on ihe Farm, the
Indians won two. Last year is best
not talked about.
Five Saturdays ago. ihe Indians
tied the all time Curtice at Stan
ford record for wins in a season.
They’re still trying to break it and
they won’t get a better chance
than they have tomorrow.

Washington State University
will bring its pigskinners into the
Stadium at 1:30 tomorrow after
noon in a game the Indians are
favored to win by a touchdown,
but don’t bet your fallout shelter
on it.
Although the Cougars have won
hut two games out of eight this
season, one of them was as recent
ly as last week and against as for
midable a foe as Oregon, who had
beaten Stanford just the week be

fore.
The offensive attack the Cou
gars will probably make use of to
morrow is something different
than the one they started the sea
son with, and seemingly a good
deal more effective. Instead ol
passing all the time, Washington
State has begun to run.
Top passing quarterback for the
Cougars, Mel Molin, has been
benched in favor of Dave Mat hie
son, and fullback George Heed
who scored three touchdown*
against Oregon, will bear the
brunt of the ball carrying duties
Should Cougar Coach Jim Suth
erland decide to pass a bit, he has
an acceptable target; junior end
Hugh Campbell, who led the conn
try in passes caught last year.
For the Indians, Rod Sears wit
start at the signal calling post
with Jim Smith and Chuck Hut lei
in reserve. Danny Spenee ant
Gary Craig will start at halfback
and Ed Comings gets the nod at
fullback. Ken Rabajian and Ha
Steuber, making his comeback
from the injured list, will he sub
stituted freely at that spot.
George Honore and Steve Put
sell will go al Ihe end positions
while Randj Vahan and Clutch
Buehler start at tackle. Frank Du
bofskj and Tom Walsh at guard
and Chris Cottle at center.
