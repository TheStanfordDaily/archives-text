# Witness For The Opposition
## 
### JOHN VLAHOVICH Evergreen Sports Editor 
WSU, having one of its worst seasons in years, will bring a fired
up team to Palo Alto this weekend to battle Stanford.
The upset over Oregon last week has given the Cougars new spirit
and they are out to beat the Indians and help redeem the sason.
DAVK MATHIESON, VVSU’s sophomore quarterback, may start
again this week and he is turning into the Cougar surprise weapon.
He hadn’t played much until the Cougars played Oregon State two
weeks ago. Then Coach Jim Sutherland put him into the game and
immediately the Cougars came to life. His playing sparked the Cougs
to a near win in that game.
For the fine job he did against the Beavers, Sutherland gave
Mathieson the starting assignment against Oregon. He ran the club
to perfection, mixing up his running and passing plays beautifully and
stopping the Duck attack. With a fired up Cougar squad behind him
Mathieson led them to a 22-21 victory, the second of the year.
The Cougars have more than just Mathieson to send against the
Indians this year. They also have Hugh Campbell, the nation’s leading
pass receiver. Although Campbell probably won’t set a new record
this year as he did last, he is already way out in front in total yardage
in the race for the national crown. It was a Campbell catch that set up
the winning Cougar touchdown last Saturday.
AT THE OTHER end of the line is Jim Boylan, another fine pass
receiver. Boylan pulled down a fantastic catch Saturday while being
guarded closely by two Ducks in order to keep a Cougar drive alive.

Reed Is the Workhorse

In the baekfield is the workhorse of the Cougars, George Reed.
Reed runs from the fullback position and when he has the ball the
opposition has its hands full holding him. It was his running that
made the big difference in the Cougar-Oregon game.
Lou Blakely, John Browne and Gary Lewis make up the rest of
the Cougar attack.
MEL MELIN, the Cougar’s number one quarterback, may again
ride the bench against the Indians. He has been bothered with a knee
injury for quite a bit of the season which has impaired his running
and throwing.
So much for the plus side. On the bad side of the sheet is the
Cougars’ tendency to beat themselves with fumbles and penalties. In
nearly every game this year the Cougars have shown a knack of losing
the ball at crucial times and many times this has cost them a victory.
There was a good chance for a win against Oregon State until the
Cougars lost the ball on an interception on the Beaver two-yard line.
Even against Oregon the Cougars fumbled, only this lime it didn’t
hurt them. They managed to recover every one of them, and in one
Play they actually picked up four extra yards thanks to a fumble.
Maybe by this time the Cougars have found the magic ingredient
that has been missing from all the other games this year. If they have
Stanford had better look out because a real tough Cougar squad is
descending upon them.

AT THE OTHER end of the line is Jim Boylan, another fine pass
receiver. Boylan pulled down a fantastic catch Saturday while being
guarded closely by two Ducks in order to keep a Cougar drive alive.

Reed Is the Workhorse

In the baekfield is the workhorse of the Cougars, George Reed.
Reed runs from the fullback position and when he has the ball the
opposition has its hands full holding him. It was his running that
made the big difference in the Cougar-Oregon game.
Lou Blakely, John Browne and Gary Lewis make up the rest of
the Cougar attack.
MEL MELIN, the Cougar’s number one quarterback, may again
ride the bench against the Indians. He has been bothered with a knee
injury for quite a bit of the season which has impaired his running
and throwing.
So much for the plus side. On the bad side of the sheet is the
Cougars’ tendency to beat themselves with fumbles and penalties. In
nearly every game this year the Cougars have shown a knack of losing
the ball at crucial times and many times this has cost them a victory.
There was a good chance for a win against Oregon State until the
Cougars lost the ball on an interception on the Beaver two-yard line.
Even against Oregon the Cougars fumbled, only this lime it didn’t
hurt them. They managed to recover every one of them, and in one
Play they actually picked up four extra yards thanks to a fumble.
Maybe by this time the Cougars have found the magic ingredient
that has been missing from all the other games this year. If they have
Stanford had better look out because a real tough Cougar squad is
descending upon them.
WSU, having one of its worst seasons in years, will bring a fired
up team to Palo Alto this weekend to battle Stanford.
The upset over Oregon last week has given the Cougars new spirit
and they are out to beat the Indians and help redeem the sason.
DAVK MATHIESON, VVSU’s sophomore quarterback, may start
again this week and he is turning into the Cougar surprise weapon.
He hadn’t played much until the Cougars played Oregon State two
weeks ago. Then Coach Jim Sutherland put him into the game and
immediately the Cougars came to life. His playing sparked the Cougs
to a near win in that game.
For the fine job he did against the Beavers, Sutherland gave
Mathieson the starting assignment against Oregon. He ran the club
to perfection, mixing up his running and passing plays beautifully and
stopping the Duck attack. With a fired up Cougar squad behind him
Mathieson led them to a 22-21 victory, the second of the year.
The Cougars have more than just Mathieson to send against the
Indians this year. They also have Hugh Campbell, the nation’s leading
pass receiver. Although Campbell probably won’t set a new record
this year as he did last, he is already way out in front in total yardage
in the race for the national crown. It was a Campbell catch that set up
the winning Cougar touchdown last Saturday.
AT THE OTHER end of the line is Jim Boylan, another fine pass
receiver. Boylan pulled down a fantastic catch Saturday while being
guarded closely by two Ducks in order to keep a Cougar drive alive.
