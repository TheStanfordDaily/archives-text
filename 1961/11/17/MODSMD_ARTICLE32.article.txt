# Card Harriers Test Fast Field in San Jose State Invitational
## 
### 
S Stanford’s cross country runners
will be shooting for an upset this
[ afternoon as they tackle the tough
est competition so far this year in
the San Jose Invitational.
San Jose State, Cal, and San
Francisco State will headline a
large field running over the San
Jose course, it four-mile path twist
ing through river beds, asphalt,
grass, and plowed field, which
Coach Payton Jordan character
izes its "the worst course my boys
will ever have to run.”
Harlan Andrews and VVeym
Kirkland, two frosh who have
been battling for the top -spot on
the squad, lead the Cards again
this week. Bill Pratt and Rich
Klier provide the more experi
enced part of the team, while three
more frosh, Paul Schlicke, Dave
Stinehack, and John Beck round
lout the top seven. The five first
j year men make up the fastest
1 frosh group in Stanford history.
The Cards will depend on strong
team running to give them a
chance of victory, trying to place
the top five runners in a group,
for Stanford doesn’t have an indi
vidual star as outstanding as Dan
ny Murphy of San Jose, Bill Mor
gan of San Francisco State, or
John Hatton of Cal. But in cross
country scoring, the fifth man is
just as important as the first.
The Spartan harriers should
provide the st if test competition,
having defeated the Indians both

times this year the two squads
have met. Against Cal, Stanford
has won two out of three, but the
Bears won the last lime out. Since
then, however, the Stanfordites
have cut their times substantially,
and they will be looking for re
venge.
Earlier this week, the entire
track squad held its second annual
Stinky Seven “Ratrace Romp.”
This seven-man team race over the
two-mile cross country course cli
maxed the fall quarter track work
outs during which every member
of the squad, including the weight
men, runs cross country.
This year’s ‘‘Stinky Seven” win
ners were the team made up of
Ken Emanuels, Bob 'Taylor, Tru
man Phillips. Sheridan Downey,
Bill Wandrey, Chick Hastings, and
Phil Lamoreaux, who scored 123
points to 139 for the runnersup.
Russ Peterson, a freshman
broad jumper, hurdler, and quar
termiler, was the winner in the
record time of 10:22. Dan Moore,
who broad jumps, and Bob Taylor,

i who runs the 440, were close be
hind.
Perhaps the noteworthy per
i formance was turned in by Dave
Weill, Stanford’s star discus
■ thrower, who stands 6’7” and
1 weighs in at 282 pounds. Weill
Covered the course in 12:02, or a
j minute and forty seconds faster
I than last year. This time is really
[ amazing for anybody who hits to
j carry that much weight over the
I hilly course.
1 Coach Jordan, pointing out that
just this week Weill received a
certificate designating him as an
j All-American in track for 1961, re
marked that the kind of determin
(ation which makes Weill work so
hard on the grueling cross coun
-1 try run is the same ingredient
j which makes him unwilling to he
| beaten in the discus throw.
