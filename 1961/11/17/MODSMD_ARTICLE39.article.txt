# SU Cops Nab Bike Thieves
## 
### 
Two San Jose State students
were caught stealing bicycles from
Stern Hall at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday,
according to Police Chief Gordon
Davis.
The students, David Van Noy.
21, and Lawrence Wells. 20, both
of 774 South 9th St., San Jose,
were turned over to San Jose State
authorities, who promised to im
pose severe disciplinary measures.
Stanford police decided not to
press criminal charges and with
drew a complaint of theft they had
filed with Santa Clara County Ju
dicial Courts against the students,
leaving punishment up to San Jose
State authorities.
Davis said Noy and Wells had
tried to avoid detection by parking
their car away from the dorm,
walking to the bike racks and rid
ing off on twâ€™o new-looking bikes
as if going on some normal errand.
Officer Donald Lellie appre
hended them as they prepared to
load the hikes into their car.
Noy and Wells said they decided
to steal bikes because parking con
ditions had become so bad at San
j Jose State. They apparently had
no previous record of offenses,
j Davis said.
The two bikes, maroon-colored
and in almost new condition, are
I being held at the Police Depart
ment until the owners claim them.
