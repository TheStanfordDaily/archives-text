# 'New' Chappie Hits Quad Monday
## 
### Ellington K. Farthingale 
Gloom reigns in the Chaparral
shack today. The first revitalized
Chappie issue was finally to make
its belated appearance today, but
its press broke down during the
last minute push.
Editor Brad Efron said, “I do not
believe the rumor sweeping cam
pus that this is part of a malicious
plot by the administration to fi
nally stamp out the Chappie. How
ever. isn’t it a strange coincidence
that recently one staff member, A1
Dodworth, was struck down in the
night by a speeding car, and an
other. Mark Draper, was held in
communicado in jail on an obvi
ously trumped-up charge. Speak
ing for the Chappies, I can only
say that our mission will not fail,
and our latest effort will hit the
stands Monday for sure.”
The only Chappie issue this
quarter will be sold on Quad at the
usual exorbitant price of forty
cents. The Chaparral, suspended
last year from campus, appears
under the auspices of a chaste,
purified Hammer and Coffin So
ciety.
