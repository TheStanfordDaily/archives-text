# UN 						Airmen Slain in Congolese Massacre
## 
### 
LEOPOLDVILLE (UPl)—Drunken Congolese soldiers bludg
eoned and shot 13 Italian United Nations airmen to death before a
jeering, white-hating crowd at Kindu Saturday, hacked their bodies
to pieces and dumped them in the Lualaba River, a U.N. spokesman
said yesterday. Sources at the Italian Embassy said some of the

soldiers’ flesh was sold in the
Kindu market place and that the
mutinous Congolese took the
severed hand of one of the vie-

Tims and threw it on a worker's
desk in the World Health Organ
ization office there.

THE ITALIAN’ Air Force men,
ranging in age from 22 to 43, had
flown to Kindu on a mercy mis
sion for the Red Cross when the
Congolese, inflamed by pro-Com
munist Antoine Gizenga’s revolt

against the central government,
seized them, clubbed them sav
agely, dragged them to a hilltop
and shot them while the crowd
cheered.

Premier Cyrilla Adoula of the
central government promised
punishment last night for the
Congolese soldiers responsible
but did not say how he could
punish 1,000 rebellious troops who
mutinied against all authority.

“Help me, help me,” he pleaded
in a broadcast to the nation last

THE UNITED NATIONS said
it was rushing all the reinforce
ments it could muster to the Kin
du region of Kivu Province to
try to bring the murderers to
justice. In New York Maj. Gen.
Sean McKeowan, commander of
U.N. forces in the Congo, ap
pealed for more troops and more
equipment.

The Congro crisis was deepen
ing hourly and it appeared that
neither Gizenga, Adoula or Presi
dent Moise Tshombe of Katanga
Province could control their own
forces. The Congolese soldiers
were reported drunk most of the
time and refusing to obey any
orders.

Arrivals from Kindu said 200
Malayan U.N. troops at Kindu
were raging to got the Congolese
and had to be restrained by their
commanding officer even though
heavily outnumbered. They were
said to feel the outraged world
might blame them for not pre
venting the mass murder.
ADOULA WARNED last night
the army’s behavior was “threat
ening the independence of the
Congo.”
“I am ashamed of Luluabourg,
Albertville and Kindu,” Adoula
said. “The government has had
enough of mutineers, and the
Congolese people have also had
enough . . . brutality, rape, pil
laging and beating are not the
role of an army.”

He said in Luluabourg rebelli
ous troops arrested t heir own
commanding officer.

U.S. sources said one plan was
lo seal off the entire Kindu area
until the slayers can be brought
to justice. But it called off a jet
strike against the drunken troops
as a “senseless reprisal.’’

LEOPOLDVILLE (UPl)—Drunken Congolese soldiers bludg
eoned and shot 13 Italian United Nations airmen to death before a
jeering, white-hating crowd at Kindu Saturday, hacked their bodies
to pieces and dumped them in the Lualaba River, a U.N. spokesman
said yesterday. Sources at the Italian Embassy said some of the

soldiers’ flesh was sold in the
Kindu market place and that the
mutinous Congolese took the
severed hand of one of the vie-

Tims and threw it on a worker's
desk in the World Health Organ
ization office there.

THE ITALIAN’ Air Force men,
ranging in age from 22 to 43, had
flown to Kindu on a mercy mis
sion for the Red Cross when the
Congolese, inflamed by pro-Com
munist Antoine Gizenga’s revolt

against the central government,
seized them, clubbed them sav
agely, dragged them to a hilltop
and shot them while the crowd
cheered.

Premier Cyrilla Adoula of the
central government promised
punishment last night for the
Congolese soldiers responsible
but did not say how he could
punish 1,000 rebellious troops who
mutinied against all authority.

“Help me, help me,” he pleaded
in a broadcast to the nation last

THE UNITED NATIONS said
it was rushing all the reinforce
ments it could muster to the Kin
du region of Kivu Province to
try to bring the murderers to
justice. In New York Maj. Gen.
Sean McKeowan, commander of
U.N. forces in the Congo, ap
pealed for more troops and more
equipment.

The Congro crisis was deepen
ing hourly and it appeared that
neither Gizenga, Adoula or Presi
dent Moise Tshombe of Katanga
Province could control their own
forces. The Congolese soldiers
were reported drunk most of the
time and refusing to obey any
orders.

Arrivals from Kindu said 200
Malayan U.N. troops at Kindu
were raging to got the Congolese
and had to be restrained by their
commanding officer even though
heavily outnumbered. They were
said to feel the outraged world
might blame them for not pre
venting the mass murder.
ADOULA WARNED last night
the army’s behavior was “threat
ening the independence of the
Congo.”
“I am ashamed of Luluabourg,
Albertville and Kindu,” Adoula
said. “The government has had
enough of mutineers, and the
Congolese people have also had
enough . . . brutality, rape, pil
laging and beating are not the
