# Hancock Elected Red Hottest Prof
## 
### 
Professor of Law Moffatt Hancock was elected Stanford’s Red
Mot Professor for 1961 yesterday in a confused—but profitable—con
clusion to the World University Service drive’s special money-rais
ing appeal. WUS chairman Randy Sugarman would announce only
approximate point totals pending final computing of the number of
penny-a-vote ballots cast for Han-*

cock (“approximately 3 5,000
votes” Sugarman) and the run
nerup, Assistant to the President
Donald Carlson with approxi
mately 28,000 pennies cast in his
favor.
Law school students took up
collections in Hancock’s classes
all day yesterday, and wound up
depositing a can containing
$251.80 (by ASSU count) at the
contest headquarters just before
the 4:15 p.m. deadline yesterday.
At the same time, the members
of the Kappa Alpha order were
collecting $240,50 to put on Carl
son, which they brought to the
polling place in a sealed brief
case just at the deadline also.
The last-minute confluence of
curi’ency put all previous com
petitors except Hancock and Carl
son out of the race and caused
some confusion when it was
claimed by some partisans (hat
one or the other of the last-min
ute deposits had not made it un
der the deadline.

Sugarman and his aides made
a quick accounting of the votes
and announced to a crowd of
about 50 (mostly law students
and Hancock men) at 5 p.m. that
Hancock was elected Red Hot
Prof.

Hancock, who instructs the
Property I class at the Law
School Wednesdays and Thurs
days at 2:00 sharp and Saturday
mornings at 10:00, will lead the
rooting section in a yell tomorrow
at the Stanford-Washington Stale
football game.
Sugarman and his assistants,
Teddy Tsongas and Trish von
Morpurgo, estimated that the
project had brought in at least
$BOO for the WUS drive.
