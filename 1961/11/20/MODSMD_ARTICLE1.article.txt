# $35,000 Damage; I-Club Left Homeless
## 
### CAROLE CRAYNE 
I-Center Gutted by Early Morning Blaze

Fire apparently started by a floor furnace gutted the inside of
the international Center early yesterday morning, causing an esti
mated $35,000 in damage and leaving the* 1-Cluh and its resident
eonple homeless. The fire, which started in the living room, burned
most ol the interior of the house except a back downstairs office

and kitchen and the upstairs
apartment of Yates and Gale Haf
ner, resident host couple.
The Hafners, the house’s only
occupants, escaped by the back
stairs, and no one was injured
by the blaze.
THE FIRE, reported at 4:29
a.m., was under control about 45
minutes later. Firemen spent an
other hour to hour and a half
putting out pocket fires and res
cuing property. Cleaning-up oper
ations continued until about 12:30
p.m.
The fire aparently started when
an overstuffed couch left on the
living room floor furnace caught
fire, and flames went up the side
of the fireplace and into the sec
ond floor and attic.
Captain Harry Lund said the
fire must have started almost an
hour before the Fire Department
got the call. All the electric clocks
in the house were stopped at 3:26
a.m., when the fire must have
shorted a circuit and blown the
fuses.
A PHONE C ALL from the girls
in Lathrop House next door came
just before an alarm from the
box near Dlnkelspiel and a call
from the I-Club resident people.
Firemen said the whole front
side of the house was burning
when they arrived, immediately
after the alarm, and flames went
up through the roof in a few
minutes.
Hafner said he was awakened
by a crashing noise of the down
stairs windows blowing out,
smelled smoke and looked out to
see smoke rolling out the living
room. He called the fire depart
ment and got his wife up, and
they went down the back stairs.
They said by the time they
reached the sidewalk, flames
were pouring out the windows
and five minutes later had gone
through the roof.
THE UPSTAIRS apart ment was
not burned itself, though prop
erty was damaged by smoke. The
first-floor office in back was left
intact, and the kitchen suffered
mainly smoke damage.
Most of the $35,000 damage was
to the house and not the contents,
except the downstairs furniture.
The piano and all the furniture
in the living room were destroyed.
About 75 per cent of the contents
upstairs were salvaged.
The I-Ccnter housed the For
eign Visitor’s Office, staffed by
Mrs. Barbara Givan, coordinator,
and her assistant Mrs. Jean Mill
er, and the Foreign Student Ad
viser’s office, which Dr. Werner
Warmbrunn heads, assisted by
Mrs. Gertrude Williams. Firemen
were able to save all their im
portant files.
THE BUILDING which had
been used as the center for activi
ties of international students for
four years, had been completely
redecorated just before school
started this fall at a cost Mrs.
Givan guessed must have been
several thousand dollars. It was
previously the home of Prof. Bar
ley Willis, and then of Chaplain
Robert Minto.
WARMBRUNN said the I-Cen
ter, a University building, was
insured but probably not for
enough to rebuild it. He said
I-Club had outgrown the house
and had hoped to acquire some
larger house on campus and ren
ovate it. perhaps in 18 months.
The I-Center served as a cam
pus “home” for the many foreign
students, most of whom live off
campus, where they could get to
gether with each other and Ameri
can students. Warmbrunn said
their greatest need right now is
to find some place for this func
tion.

Hf> hopes a temporary meeting
place may be found in the Union
next quarter and a permanent
home next fall. He invited sug
gestions.
THE DAILY luncheon groups
will probably be dropped, but
I Club Evening Abroads may be
held in a dormitory, Warmbrunn
said. He noted last Saturday’s
Evening Abroad was held at Wil
bur. The Friday night discussions
can be held in some classroom,
he said.
Arroyo House in Wilbur has
offered the use of Us lounge to
the 1 Club anytime they wish, The
Daily was told yesterday.
The I-Center fire was almost
as bad as the Fiji house fire the
summer of 1960, according to
Assistant Chief Frank Jurian, but
new men added to t he force since
then gave plenty of help at this
one, and the fire was brought un
der control before the kitchen and
living quarters in the rear were
destroyed, he said.
HE SAID Chief John Marston
had been away on vacation and
the department had barely
enough men to roll three trucks
for the Fiji fire. The force was
almost doubled last March when
II full time firemen were added.

I-CENTER STANDS GUTTED in the wake of an early morning blaze which destroyed much of its interior and left the I-Club without a home
The fire, which started in a floor furnace near the living room fireplace, swept the lower living areas, causing $35,000 worth of damage,
although the upper story was comparatively untouched by the flames.

FIREMEN REMOVE the charred remains of an upright piano de
stroyed in the I-Center tire early yesterday morning. The tire, which
took 45 minutes to control, routed the Center's resident couple, but
caused no injuries.
