## On 'The New Great Power' 
### 
It now seems certain that the
Administration will go to Con
gress in the coming session to ask
for new powers in order to negoti
ate about tariffs and trade ar
rangements with the European
Common Market. This is a bold de
cision, and not without consider
able risk.
It was taken because of a feel
ing in the highest councils of gov
ernment that despite the fact that
1962 is not an ideal time to begin
the painful process of adjustment
to the emerging new trading
world, a beginning cannot be put
off. This sense of urgency is due
only in part to the fact that the
Trade Agreements Act expires
next summer.
More than that, the Western
Community and the United States
in particular need a momentum
which has been lacking in recent
months. Preparation for the “giant
step” into the new trading world
will, one may hope, give a sense
of moving forward again.
THE DECISION to move for
ward now rather than in 1963 is
risky, not only because 1962 is an
election year when, as the saying
goes, the> tariff becomes a local
issue in each district.
An even greater difficulty, it
seems to me, is that Congress and
the country will not have before
them as a going concern the new
Common Market which will be cre
ated when Great Britain and other
European powers join (he original
six members. It may not be easy
to make the country understand
what the enlarged Common Mar
ket is going to be in the future,
when in fact it is not yet in exist
ence.
A mighty effort of public educa
tion is going to be needed to make
the country realize how revolu
tionary the change is going to be.
The enlarged Common Market
will be the biggest trading area in
the world. It will soon have free
trade within it and a common tar
iff against us and all the other na
tions around it. This gigantic in
dustrial complex is now growing
at a rate which is twice our own
average since the Korean War.
AS AN example, which ought to
be favorable to the United States,
we may look at the production of
motor vehicles. The Common Mar
ket and Britain together are now
producing just short of 6,000,000
vehicles a year. We are now pro
ducing at the rate of 8,000,000 a
year. But since 1950, our output
has changed very little while that
of the Common Market countries
has quadrupled. Even Britain, with
a slower rate of growth than that
of the Western Continent, has
doubled its output.
In the new Common Market we
shall be facing a very formidable
competitor with a faster rate of
growth, with an enormous inter
nal market, and with a highly effi
cient capacity to export. We shall
be facing not only a competition
which is formidable but the likeli
hood of deep difficulties in our
balance of payments. If we do not
take strong measures at home and
abroad, we may well find ourselves

in an extremely difficult decade.
As the realities become visible
to us, we shall find that we must
reappraise assumptions which this
generation of Americans have be
come used to taking for granted.
Primarily, there is the assumption
that in our relations with Europe
we are the givers and they are the
receivers, that it depends on us,
therefore, how much or how little
we shall participate in the affairs
of Europe. This assumption is
ceasing to be valid as Western Eu
rope, with its amazingly rapid ec
onomic growth, draws closely to
gether toward economic and po
litical union.

WE HAVE JUST begun to dis
cuss the question of how we pro
pose to adjust ourselves to the new
economic reality. Discussion has
been started by the Clayton-Herter
report, the path-breaking speech
of Mr. George Ball before the Na
tional Foreign Trade Convention,
and the President’s remarks at his
recent press conference. In much
of the comment on what they have
said the old assumption persists
—that we are able to fix the terms
on which we shall associate our
selves with the new Common Mar
ket. But at once we are being warn
ed from Europe that it is not going
to work that way.
We are being told, quite bluntly
for example by Mr. William Rees-
Mogg, the discerning and accom
plished economic editor of the
“Sunday Times” of London, that
it will now be difficult to obtain
“any settlement with Europe
which will expand American trad
ing opportunities. The independ
ence of Europe, from America and
Russia, has now become a theme
to which both the Americans and
Russians are going to be asked to
dance.”
This means that the Common
Market is not merely a profitable
economic arrangement. It is also
the substance of a political union
which is being forged into a new
great power in the world. In this
century we have sgen great pow
ers die.
NOW, IT would seem, we arc
witnessing the birth of a new great
power. What the world knows as
the Common Market and as the
European Economic Community
is not, as the names suggest,
merely an enlightened device for
promoting prosperity. It is that.
But the inner motive and resolve
of the leaders of the Common Mar
ket is to make Europe again, as it
was for so many centuries—until
the World Wars of our times—a

great center of power and influ
ence around the globe.
That is why when Britain decid
ed to apply for membership, the
crucial question was not how to
safeguard the economic interests
of the Commonwealth. That is
quite manageable. The crucial
question has been whether Great
Britain was renouncing its politi
cal separation from the Continent,
and whether it would then
pate in the political purposes of
the Continental countries.
AFTER the British have settled
their relationship, it will be our
turn to begin to negotiate over our
trade relations with the enlarged
Common Market. But even before
formal negotiations have begun,
our intention to be part of a broad
er liberal trade area, announced
in the very convincing form of the
President’s coming legislative pro
posals to the Congress, may have
helped the smaller European pow
ers and the Commonwealth coun
tries to reach an accommodation
with the Common Market. Our in
fluence, too, will protect the in
terests of Latin America and
Japan.
Despite this beneficient influ
ence we may not, as Mr. Rees-
Moggs points out, find Europe
over-eager to strike a bargain with
us. We shall then have to argue
that generalized free trade
throughout the Atlantic Communi
ty need not impair the closer po
litical union of Europe, and also
that an open trading community
is the foundation of closer econ
omic and political cooperation
within the Atlantic Community as
a whole.

ing opportunities. The independ
ence of Europe, from America and
Russia, has now become a theme
to which both the Americans and
Russians are going to be asked to
dance.”
This means that the Common
Market is not merely a profitable
economic arrangement. It is also
the substance of a political union
which is being forged into a new
great power in the world. In this
century we have sgen great pow
ers die.
NOW, IT would seem, we arc
witnessing the birth of a new great
power. What the world knows as
the Common Market and as the
European Economic Community
is not, as the names suggest,
merely an enlightened device for
promoting prosperity. It is that.
But the inner motive and resolve
of the leaders of the Common Mar
ket is to make Europe again, as it
was for so many centuries—until
the World Wars of our times—a

great center of power and influ
ence around the globe.
That is why when Britain decid
ed to apply for membership, the
crucial question was not how to
safeguard the economic interests
of the Commonwealth. That is
quite manageable. The crucial
question has been whether Great
Britain was renouncing its politi
cal separation from the Continent,
and whether it would then
pate in the political purposes of
the Continental countries.
AFTER the British have settled
their relationship, it will be our
turn to begin to negotiate over our
trade relations with the enlarged
Common Market. But even before
formal negotiations have begun,
our intention to be part of a broad
er liberal trade area, announced
in the very convincing form of the
President’s coming legislative pro
posals to the Congress, may have
helped the smaller European pow
ers and the Commonwealth coun
tries to reach an accommodation
with the Common Market. Our in
fluence, too, will protect the in
terests of Latin America and
Japan.
Despite this beneficient influ
ence we may not, as Mr. Rees-
Moggs points out, find Europe
over-eager to strike a bargain with
us. We shall then have to argue
that generalized free trade
throughout the Atlantic Communi
ty need not impair the closer po
litical union of Europe, and also
that an open trading community
is the foundation of closer econ
omic and political cooperation
within the Atlantic Community as
a whole.

It now seems certain that the
Administration will go to Con
gress in the coming session to ask
for new powers in order to negoti
ate about tariffs and trade ar
rangements with the European
Common Market. This is a bold de
cision, and not without consider
able risk.
It was taken because of a feel
ing in the highest councils of gov
ernment that despite the fact that
1962 is not an ideal time to begin
the painful process of adjustment
to the emerging new trading
world, a beginning cannot be put
off. This sense of urgency is due
only in part to the fact that the
Trade Agreements Act expires
next summer.
More than that, the Western
Community and the United States
in particular need a momentum
which has been lacking in recent
months. Preparation for the “giant
step” into the new trading world
will, one may hope, give a sense
of moving forward again.
THE DECISION to move for
ward now rather than in 1963 is
risky, not only because 1962 is an
election year when, as the saying
goes, the> tariff becomes a local
issue in each district.
An even greater difficulty, it
seems to me, is that Congress and
the country will not have before
them as a going concern the new
Common Market which will be cre
ated when Great Britain and other
European powers join (he original
six members. It may not be easy
to make the country understand
what the enlarged Common Mar
ket is going to be in the future,
when in fact it is not yet in exist
ence.
A mighty effort of public educa
tion is going to be needed to make
the country realize how revolu
tionary the change is going to be.
The enlarged Common Market
will be the biggest trading area in
the world. It will soon have free
trade within it and a common tar
iff against us and all the other na
tions around it. This gigantic in
dustrial complex is now growing
at a rate which is twice our own
average since the Korean War.
AS AN example, which ought to
be favorable to the United States,
we may look at the production of
motor vehicles. The Common Mar
ket and Britain together are now
producing just short of 6,000,000
vehicles a year. We are now pro
ducing at the rate of 8,000,000 a
year. But since 1950, our output
has changed very little while that
of the Common Market countries
has quadrupled. Even Britain, with
a slower rate of growth than that
of the Western Continent, has
doubled its output.
In the new Common Market we
shall be facing a very formidable
competitor with a faster rate of
growth, with an enormous inter
nal market, and with a highly effi
cient capacity to export. We shall
be facing not only a competition
which is formidable but the likeli
hood of deep difficulties in our
balance of payments. If we do not
take strong measures at home and
abroad, we may well find ourselves

in an extremely difficult decade.
As the realities become visible
to us, we shall find that we must
reappraise assumptions which this
generation of Americans have be
come used to taking for granted.
Primarily, there is the assumption
that in our relations with Europe
we are the givers and they are the
receivers, that it depends on us,
therefore, how much or how little
we shall participate in the affairs
of Europe. This assumption is
ceasing to be valid as Western Eu
rope, with its amazingly rapid ec
onomic growth, draws closely to
gether toward economic and po
litical union.

WE HAVE JUST begun to dis
cuss the question of how we pro
pose to adjust ourselves to the new
economic reality. Discussion has
been started by the Clayton-Herter
report, the path-breaking speech
of Mr. George Ball before the Na
tional Foreign Trade Convention,
and the President’s remarks at his
recent press conference. In much
of the comment on what they have
said the old assumption persists
—that we are able to fix the terms
on which we shall associate our
selves with the new Common Mar
ket. But at once we are being warn
ed from Europe that it is not going
to work that way.
We are being told, quite bluntly
for example by Mr. William Rees-
Mogg, the discerning and accom
plished economic editor of the
“Sunday Times” of London, that
it will now be difficult to obtain
“any settlement with Europe
which will expand American trad
ing opportunities. The independ
ence of Europe, from America and
Russia, has now become a theme
to which both the Americans and
Russians are going to be asked to

producing just short of 6,000,000
vehicles a year. We are now pro
ducing at the rate of 8,000,000 a
year. But since 1950, our output
has changed very little while that
of the Common Market countries
has quadrupled. Even Britain, with
a slower rate of growth than that
of the Western Continent, has
doubled its output.
In the new Common Market we
shall be facing a very formidable
competitor with a faster rate of
growth, with an enormous inter
nal market, and with a highly effi
cient capacity to export. We shall
be facing not only a competition
which is formidable but the likeli
hood of deep difficulties in our
balance of payments. If we do not
take strong measures at home and
abroad, we may well find ourselves

in an extremely difficult decade.
As the realities become visible
to us, we shall find that we must
reappraise assumptions which this
generation of Americans have be
come used to taking for granted.
Primarily, there is the assumption
that in our relations with Europe
we are the givers and they are the
receivers, that it depends on us,
therefore, how much or how little
we shall participate in the affairs
of Europe. This assumption is
ceasing to be valid as Western Eu
rope, with its amazingly rapid ec
onomic growth, draws closely to
gether toward economic and po
litical union.

WE HAVE JUST begun to dis
cuss the question of how we pro
pose to adjust ourselves to the new
economic reality. Discussion has
been started by the Clayton-Herter
report, the path-breaking speech
of Mr. George Ball before the Na
tional Foreign Trade Convention,
and the President’s remarks at his
recent press conference. In much
of the comment on what they have
said the old assumption persists
—that we are able to fix the terms
on which we shall associate our
selves with the new Common Mar
ket. But at once we are being warn
ed from Europe that it is not going
to work that way.
We are being told, quite bluntly
for example by Mr. William Rees-
Mogg, the discerning and accom
plished economic editor of the
“Sunday Times” of London, that
it will now be difficult to obtain
“any settlement with Europe
which will expand American trad
ing opportunities. The independ
ence of Europe, from America and
Russia, has now become a theme
to which both the Americans and
Russians are going to be asked to
dance.”
This means that the Common
Market is not merely a profitable
economic arrangement. It is also
the substance of a political union
which is being forged into a new
great power in the world. In this
century we have sgen great pow
ers die.
NOW, IT would seem, we arc
witnessing the birth of a new great
power. What the world knows as
the Common Market and as the
European Economic Community
is not, as the names suggest,
merely an enlightened device for
promoting prosperity. It is that.
But the inner motive and resolve
of the leaders of the Common Mar
ket is to make Europe again, as it
was for so many centuries—until
the World Wars of our times—a

great center of power and influ
ence around the globe.
That is why when Britain decid
ed to apply for membership, the
crucial question was not how to
safeguard the economic interests
of the Commonwealth. That is
quite manageable. The crucial
question has been whether Great
Britain was renouncing its politi
cal separation from the Continent,
and whether it would then
pate in the political purposes of
the Continental countries.
AFTER the British have settled
their relationship, it will be our
turn to begin to negotiate over our
trade relations with the enlarged
Common Market. But even before
formal negotiations have begun,
our intention to be part of a broad
er liberal trade area, announced
in the very convincing form of the
President’s coming legislative pro
posals to the Congress, may have
helped the smaller European pow
ers and the Commonwealth coun
tries to reach an accommodation
with the Common Market. Our in
fluence, too, will protect the in
terests of Latin America and
Japan.
Despite this beneficient influ
ence we may not, as Mr. Rees-
Moggs points out, find Europe
over-eager to strike a bargain with
us. We shall then have to argue
that generalized free trade
throughout the Atlantic Communi
ty need not impair the closer po
litical union of Europe, and also
that an open trading community
is the foundation of closer econ
omic and political cooperation
within the Atlantic Community as
a whole.

It now seems certain that the
Administration will go to Con
gress in the coming session to ask
for new powers in order to negoti
ate about tariffs and trade ar
rangements with the European
Common Market. This is a bold de
cision, and not without consider
able risk.
It was taken because of a feel
ing in the highest councils of gov
ernment that despite the fact that
1962 is not an ideal time to begin
the painful process of adjustment
to the emerging new trading
world, a beginning cannot be put
off. This sense of urgency is due
only in part to the fact that the
Trade Agreements Act expires
next summer.
More than that, the Western
Community and the United States
in particular need a momentum
which has been lacking in recent
months. Preparation for the “giant
step” into the new trading world
will, one may hope, give a sense
of moving forward again.
THE DECISION to move for
ward now rather than in 1963 is
risky, not only because 1962 is an
election year when, as the saying
goes, the> tariff becomes a local
issue in each district.
An even greater difficulty, it
seems to me, is that Congress and
the country will not have before
them as a going concern the new
Common Market which will be cre
ated when Great Britain and other
European powers join (he original
six members. It may not be easy
to make the country understand
what the enlarged Common Mar
ket is going to be in the future,
when in fact it is not yet in exist
ence.
A mighty effort of public educa
tion is going to be needed to make
the country realize how revolu
tionary the change is going to be.
The enlarged Common Market
will be the biggest trading area in
the world. It will soon have free
trade within it and a common tar
iff against us and all the other na
tions around it. This gigantic in
dustrial complex is now growing
at a rate which is twice our own
average since the Korean War.
AS AN example, which ought to
be favorable to the United States,
we may look at the production of
motor vehicles. The Common Mar
ket and Britain together are now
producing just short of 6,000,000
vehicles a year. We are now pro

omic and political cooperation
within the Atlantic Community as
a whole.

It now seems certain that the
Administration will go to Con
gress in the coming session to ask
for new powers in order to negoti
ate about tariffs and trade ar
rangements with the European
Common Market. This is a bold de
cision, and not without consider
able risk.
It was taken because of a feel
ing in the highest councils of gov
ernment that despite the fact that
1962 is not an ideal time to begin
the painful process of adjustment
to the emerging new trading
world, a beginning cannot be put
off. This sense of urgency is due
only in part to the fact that the
Trade Agreements Act expires
next summer.
More than that, the Western
Community and the United States
in particular need a momentum
which has been lacking in recent
months. Preparation for the “giant
step” into the new trading world
will, one may hope, give a sense
of moving forward again.
THE DECISION to move for
ward now rather than in 1963 is
risky, not only because 1962 is an
election year when, as the saying
goes, the> tariff becomes a local
issue in each district.
An even greater difficulty, it
seems to me, is that Congress and
the country will not have before
them as a going concern the new
Common Market which will be cre
ated when Great Britain and other
European powers join (he original
six members. It may not be easy
to make the country understand
what the enlarged Common Mar
ket is going to be in the future,
when in fact it is not yet in exist
ence.
A mighty effort of public educa
tion is going to be needed to make
the country realize how revolu
tionary the change is going to be.
The enlarged Common Market
will be the biggest trading area in
the world. It will soon have free
trade within it and a common tar
iff against us and all the other na
tions around it. This gigantic in
dustrial complex is now growing
at a rate which is twice our own
average since the Korean War.
AS AN example, which ought to
be favorable to the United States,
we may look at the production of
motor vehicles. The Common Mar
ket and Britain together are now
producing just short of 6,000,000
vehicles a year. We are now pro
ducing at the rate of 8,000,000 a
year. But since 1950, our output
has changed very little while that
of the Common Market countries
has quadrupled. Even Britain, with
a slower rate of growth than that
of the Western Continent, has
doubled its output.
In the new Common Market we
shall be facing a very formidable
competitor with a faster rate of
growth, with an enormous inter
nal market, and with a highly effi
cient capacity to export. We shall
be facing not only a competition
which is formidable but the likeli
hood of deep difficulties in our
balance of payments. If we do not
take strong measures at home and
abroad, we may well find ourselves

in an extremely difficult decade.
As the realities become visible
to us, we shall find that we must
reappraise assumptions which this
generation of Americans have be
come used to taking for granted.
Primarily, there is the assumption
that in our relations with Europe
we are the givers and they are the
receivers, that it depends on us,
therefore, how much or how little
we shall participate in the affairs
of Europe. This assumption is
ceasing to be valid as Western Eu
rope, with its amazingly rapid ec
onomic growth, draws closely to
gether toward economic and po
litical union.

WE HAVE JUST begun to dis
cuss the question of how we pro
pose to adjust ourselves to the new
economic reality. Discussion has
been started by the Clayton-Herter
report, the path-breaking speech
of Mr. George Ball before the Na
tional Foreign Trade Convention,
and the President’s remarks at his
recent press conference. In much
of the comment on what they have
said the old assumption persists
—that we are able to fix the terms
on which we shall associate our
selves with the new Common Mar
ket. But at once we are being warn
ed from Europe that it is not going
to work that way.
We are being told, quite bluntly
for example by Mr. William Rees-
Mogg, the discerning and accom
plished economic editor of the
“Sunday Times” of London, that
it will now be difficult to obtain
“any settlement with Europe
which will expand American trad
ing opportunities. The independ
ence of Europe, from America and
Russia, has now become a theme
to which both the Americans and
Russians are going to be asked to
dance.”
This means that the Common
Market is not merely a profitable
economic arrangement. It is also
the substance of a political union
which is being forged into a new
great power in the world. In this
century we have sgen great pow
ers die.
NOW, IT would seem, we arc
witnessing the birth of a new great
power. What the world knows as
the Common Market and as the
European Economic Community
is not, as the names suggest,
merely an enlightened device for
promoting prosperity. It is that.
But the inner motive and resolve
of the leaders of the Common Mar
ket is to make Europe again, as it
was for so many centuries—until
the World Wars of our times—a

great center of power and influ
ence around the globe.
That is why when Britain decid
ed to apply for membership, the
crucial question was not how to
safeguard the economic interests
of the Commonwealth. That is
quite manageable. The crucial
question has been whether Great
Britain was renouncing its politi
cal separation from the Continent,
and whether it would then
pate in the political purposes of
the Continental countries.
AFTER the British have settled
their relationship, it will be our
turn to begin to negotiate over our
trade relations with the enlarged
Common Market. But even before
formal negotiations have begun,
our intention to be part of a broad
er liberal trade area, announced
in the very convincing form of the
President’s coming legislative pro
posals to the Congress, may have
helped the smaller European pow
ers and the Commonwealth coun
tries to reach an accommodation
with the Common Market. Our in
fluence, too, will protect the in
terests of Latin America and
Japan.
Despite this beneficient influ
ence we may not, as Mr. Rees-
Moggs points out, find Europe
over-eager to strike a bargain with
us. We shall then have to argue
that generalized free trade
throughout the Atlantic Communi
ty need not impair the closer po
litical union of Europe, and also
that an open trading community
is the foundation of closer econ
omic and political cooperation
within the Atlantic Community as
a whole.
