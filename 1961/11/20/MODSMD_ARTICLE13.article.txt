# $150 Thousand Added To Student Loan Funds
## 
### 
University trustees have ap
proved a $150,000 boost in the
amount of funds available for stu
dent loans.

This action was necessary to
meet student loan requests which
have increased four-fold since
1957.

In contrast to a scholarship, fel
lowship or grant-in-aid which does
not have to be repaid, a student
loan must be repaid within five
years from graduation. The loan
bears interest while the student is
in school and the rate increases
modestly after he completes his
studies.

“Despite the fact that Stanford
has utilized substantial amounts
from the federal government un
der the National Defense Educa

tion Act (NDEAi student loan pro
gram,” says Kenneth M. Cuth
bcrtson, University vice president
for finance, “student needs have
outstripped the University’s re
sources.”

In order to meet the rising de
mand for student aid, the Univer
sity seeks a minimum of $7,000,000
for student loans and scholarships
through the PACE program. Of
this total, $6.5 million will be used
for scholarships and fellowships,
while $500,000 will be used for
loans.
“Stanford has made and will
continue to make every effort to
see that a student who really
wants and deserves a fine univer
sity education will not lack proper
financial support,” Cuthbertson
notes.
