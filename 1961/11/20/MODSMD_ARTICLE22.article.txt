# PURSELL, BUTLER INJURED
## Cougars Pounce on Hapless Indians 
### RON RAPOPORT 
Seemingly out to prove Coach
Jack Curtice’s recently pro
nounced dictum that, “we bring
out the best in everybody,” Stan
ford's football team made oft
beaten Washington State look like
world-beaters in the Stadium Sat
urday. The Indians lost 30-0, be
fore 21,000 onlookers.
It was the fifth loss in a row for
the Tribe, which now has a season
record of three wins and six de
feats. The win was the third for
the Cougars this year.
THE TOTAL casualty list con
sisted of a football game, two
front-line players and a pom pon
girl.
Starting left end Steve Pursell
reinjured his ankle in the third
quarter and quarterback Chuck
Butler suffered a knee injury in
the same period. Both will miss
Big Game (that’s against Cal, for
the uninitiated) next week. Pom
ponner Judy Webb said her knee
popped out of joint while sitting
on the grass during the first peri
od. However, she should be ready
for action next week.
It was a rough day all around
for Stanford. Winner of but Two
games all season, Washington
State was in command from the
beginning and seemed barely to be
breathing hard while delivering to
the Indians their worst loss of the
year. And Stanford has been beat
en by experts this season; Michi
gan State, for instance.
EVEN THOUGH the Cougars
mixed their attack and threw few
er passes than they usually do,
Hugh Campbell, their record
breaking end, was able to haul in
five tosses for a total of 72 yards
and two touchdowns. Previously,
only one score had been made
against the Tribe through the air
this year.
In the second quarter, Campbell
leaped high into the air in the end
zone to take a six-yard pass from
quarterback Mel Melin for one
Cougar touchdown. And the junior
from Saratoga grabbed a five-yard
scoring throw from Melin in the
fourth quarter.
That catch came one play after
end Mike Carboni made a beauti
ful snag of a Melin aerial at the
sideline stripe with Stanford de
fenders Tim Hansel and Gary
Craig all over him. The play cov
ered 43 yards.
WASHINGTON State’s first
touchdown came early in the first
period when fullback George Reed
captured a 55-yard march with a
five-yard charge up the middle.
Reed bore the brunt of the Cou
gars’ running game, carrying 16
times for 58 yards.
In the third quarter Melin got
two chances at a field goal and
made good on one of them. After
missing a 37-yard attempt he
scored on a 33-yard try a few min
utes later.
The most spectacular run of the
day, which covered 70 yards, also
resulted in a Washington State
touchdown. Left halfback John

Browne took a hanrloff from Molin |
on a reverse, cautiously threaded
his way through the Stanford sec
ondary and then outran two In
dian defensemen to the goal line.
MUCH TO their chagrin, the In
dians were unable to come up with
any similar hysterics. Thev just
didn’t have it. Twice in the first !
half they were presented with the j
ball deep in opposition territory, j
but neither time were they able to
get very far.
Late in the first period, Cougar
halfback Jim Boylan fumbled an
Indian punt which Stanford guard
Errol Scott recovered on WSU’s
25-yard line.
Fullback Ken Babajian banged
j up the middle for three yards, but
| quarterback Rod Sears threw in
complete twice and halfback Dan
ny Spence’s fourth down effort
| was only good for four yards. The
Cougars gained possession on
(heir own 18-yard line.
FIVE MINUTES later, Stanford
end George Honore picked off one
of Melin’s passes on the Cougar
25 to give the Tribe its second gold
en opportunity.
After Sears threw incomplete
j once, halfback Craig made gains
j of five and three yards on succes
sive plays. Staying with the suc
cessful formula, Craig carried
j again, but WSU guard Jerry Co
j nine figured things out and broke
! through the line to drop Craig for
a two-yard loss on the 19.
Again Washington State took
over and Stanford never got within I

1 35 yards of the goal line there-1
after.
STATISTICALLY, the Tribe j
j was overwhelmed as it had only
five first downs to the Cougars’
20 (Stanford’s initial first down
j didn’t come until the second period
j and a disbelieving referee wouldn’t
I allow it until ho had brought out
| the measuring chains and stared
j at them and the ball for a while).
The Cougars rolled up a satisfy
ing total of 443 yards 291 on the
ground and 152 on passes with 10
completions out of 18 tries—while
the Indians came through with the
anemic total of 120 total yards—7l
by rushing and 49 by passing with
5 connections out of 13 attempts.
The Tribe completed nary a
pass in the first half and, in fact,
could come through with no more
than 36 yards overall during that
time.
STANFORD ( ENTER Kent Col
! berg was ejected from the game j
j for unnecessary roughness late in
the game on a play that saw a pass |
by Indian quarterback Jim Smith
intercepted.
And if anyone in the crowd was
in the mood for amusement, the (
chance was provided on a piece of j
fancy but futile footwork by j
Campbell.
Early in the second quarter,
Campbell made a nice catch at the
sideline of a 39-yard pass by quar
terback Dave Mathieson. Starting
goalward, Campbell saw himself
hemmed in by Indians so he turn
j ed away toward the center of the

gridiron. But that path was also
blocked by Stanford defenders
so Campbell turned around to
head back toward his own goal
line hoping to pick up some run
ning loom.
AFTER ABOUT half a stop he
smashed into one of his own team
mates, who was rushing up to pro
vide some blocking assistance.
Campbell was knocked upfield by
the contact and fell exactly where
he had caught the ball.
Two plays later Hansel inter
cepted a pass.


WASHINGTON STATE FULLBACK GEORGE REED is stopped short of the goal by Stanford tacklers
C. B. Simons (71), John Butler (69), and Gary Craig (40). This scene was not typical of Saturday's
game, as Washington State defeated Stanford 30-0.
