The San Francisco Forty-Niners
ran up a 41-31 triumph over the
Chicago Boars yesterday in San
Francisco, with John Brodie
throwing three touchdown passes.
The Forty-Niners used their
shotgun formation only a half
dozen limes, and Brodie played
the whole game at quarterback.
Brodie passed 19 times, com
pleted 11, and gained 326 yards
in the air. The three touchdown
passes were thrown to Aaron
Thomas, 70 and 46 yards, and
Monte Stickles, 44 yards. R. C.
Owens also scored for San Fran
cisco after receiving a lateral
from C. R. Roberts. The play car
ried 77 yards.
