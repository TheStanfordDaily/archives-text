# Curtice Lauds Cougars; Says Tribe Had 'Flat Day'
## 
### BEN TIPTON 
“I’ve got no explanation and no
excuses,” said a mournful Jack
Curtice after last Saturday’s

game. “Washington State was in
there hustling. They were up and
we were down.

“We were physically tired and
mentally flat,” Curtice continued.
“We couldn’t get moving, either
on offense or defense.” The Cards,
held to a pitiful 120 yards total of
fense, were ripped by the Wash
ington Slaters for 443 yards.

ASKED IF anyone had looked
“even a little bit good” for the In
lians, Curtice said that there had
been no standouts in either direc
tion, but that the whole team “just
had a flat day.”

“We had this game coming,
though,” said Curtice. “When you
play a schedule like ours with our
depth and our injuries, the Grim
Reaper has to catch up with you

some time.” Added to an injury
list already as long as the average
man’s arm were quarterback
Chuck Butler anti end Steve Pur
sell. Neither was expected to re
cover in time for the Big Game.
Curtice had nothing but praise
for the Washington State team.
“They were up for us. They got a
taste of victory last week and that
helped them tremendously.” He
was referring to the Staters’ con
quest of Oregon, Mol Renfro, and
company, the Cougars’ second vic
toiy in eight starts previous to
their encounter with Stanford,

WHEN ASKED about the In
dians’ prospects in the Big Game,
Curtice nearly groaned aloud
“We’re so crippled and so beat that
I just have to try to patch a team
together,” he lamented. Comment
ing on Cal’s 53-7 loss to Kansas:
‘‘Kansas has a pretty good team, I
guess.”
It may prove to be a battle of the

walking wounded next week. The
Bears found themselves tagged
with injuries to four key players
after last Saturday, any of which
might keep its owner out of the
Big Game. Cal coach Marv Levy,
speaking after the game, said,
“Some of our kids played in the
game who were unable to practice.
Some got into the game for the
first time. It’s been a rough, rough
season.”

Levy would probably have
agreed with Cactus Jack's sum
mary of the situation: “We’re
hurlin’.”

some time.” Added to an injury
list already as long as the average
man’s arm were quarterback
Chuck Butler anti end Steve Pur
sell. Neither was expected to re
cover in time for the Big Game.
Curtice had nothing but praise
for the Washington State team.
“They were up for us. They got a
taste of victory last week and that
helped them tremendously.” He
was referring to the Staters’ con
quest of Oregon, Mol Renfro, and
company, the Cougars’ second vic
toiy in eight starts previous to
their encounter with Stanford,

WHEN ASKED about the In
dians’ prospects in the Big Game,
Curtice nearly groaned aloud
“We’re so crippled and so beat that
I just have to try to patch a team
together,” he lamented. Comment
ing on Cal’s 53-7 loss to Kansas:
‘‘Kansas has a pretty good team, I
guess.”
It may prove to be a battle of the

walking wounded next week. The
Bears found themselves tagged
with injuries to four key players
after last Saturday, any of which
might keep its owner out of the
Big Game. Cal coach Marv Levy,
speaking after the game, said,
“Some of our kids played in the
game who were unable to practice.
Some got into the game for the
first time. It’s been a rough, rough
season.”

Levy would probably have
agreed with Cactus Jack's sum
mary of the situation: “We’re
hurlin’.”
“I’ve got no explanation and no
excuses,” said a mournful Jack
Curtice after last Saturday’s

game. “Washington State was in
there hustling. They were up and
we were down.

“We were physically tired and
mentally flat,” Curtice continued.
“We couldn’t get moving, either
on offense or defense.” The Cards,
held to a pitiful 120 yards total of
fense, were ripped by the Wash
ington Slaters for 443 yards.

ASKED IF anyone had looked
“even a little bit good” for the In
lians, Curtice said that there had
been no standouts in either direc
tion, but that the whole team “just
had a flat day.”

“We had this game coming,
though,” said Curtice. “When you
play a schedule like ours with our
depth and our injuries, the Grim
Reaper has to catch up with you

some time.” Added to an injury
