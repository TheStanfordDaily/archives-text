have been the major cause of his
squad’s defeats this year.
Sutherland went on to say that
this year his team has had the dif
ficult problem of adjusting them
selves to home and coast games
after returning from long road
campaigns. "This has definitely
been a major problem, but as for
today’s game, I feel Stanford
didn’t anticipate the game we pro
vided.”

and All-American candidate Hugh
Campbell were singled out for in
dividual praise. Fullbacks Reed

two scores and gained valuable
ground yardage on end sweeps.
