# El Capitan Downed by DU Junipero Wins
## 
### 
The Daily erroneously listed Los
Arcos Friday as the first place
team in the eating club league,
rather than El Capitan, which fin
ished with a 6-0 record, including
a win over Arcos.

The club champions closed their
season Friday with a narrow 7-0
defeat at the hands of a bigger and
rougher, though not necessarily
tougher, Delta Upsilon team.

The DU’s scored late in the first
half, after intercepting a pass
deep in El Cap territory, then
hung on to win. The second half
was marked by two goal line
stands by the Capitan defensive
platoon, which yielded only five
touchdowns during the seven
games they played.
The defensive line of Stove
Roberts, Jim Harris, and Roger
Cowan, backed up by Lee Hunts
man, with Mike Glazer, Casey
Case, Jim Young, and Jeff Dander
in the secondary, held the peren
nially powerful DU’s in check, but
the offense couldn't move the ball.
Other scores were Phi Kap 45,
Junipero II 0; SAE I 21, Burbank
6; Law I 18, Sigma Nu 6; Junip
ero I 18. Delt I 12; Phi Sig 33, Ser
ra I 7; Beta Biz 19, Larkin 13; and
SRAC 53, DU II 0.
