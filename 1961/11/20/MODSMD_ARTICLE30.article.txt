## Soccermen Tie UBC, 3-3 With Clark Scoring Two 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford’s soccer team ended its
season on a note of cautious opti
mism. The Indians earned a 3-3 tie
with (he University of British Co
lumbia Saturday on the Stanford
soccer field.

The University of British Co
lumbia often penetrated the Stan
ford half of (he field, but Stanford
was clearly the more dangerous
team, as the speedy Tribe forward
line time and again took the full
backs’ clearing kicks and bore
down on a lonely Thunderbird
goalie.

ÜBC SCORED first in the first
half, with 22 minutes gone. The
center forward headed a goal past
frosh goalie Tom Paulson to give
the Birds a 1-0 lead at the half.

Their lead was short-lived. Stan
ford scored 14 minutes after the
beginning of the second half on a
trick play. Stanford was awarded
a free kick at the goal because of
a ÜBC infraction, with the Thun
derbirds permitted to put men be
tween the Indian shooter and the
goal.

The Birds crowded five men in
front of the goal, but a Stanford

man edged between them, and
when shooter Ben Zinn shot, ho
moved out. Zinn’s shot went be
tween the ÜBC men, and wing Ed
Clark kicked in his first of two
goals.
CLARK’S SECOND goal came !
44 seconds later on a perfect na-ss !
from Larry Chukwudbe. The cen- j
ter cross left Clark in easy range I
on Stanford’s go-ahead score.
ÜBC tied the score at 2-2 on
Joe Johnson’s penalty kick. A
Stanford man had touched the hall
in the penalty area.
ÜBC went ahead 3-2, and Stan
ford seemingly was dead, but with |
35 seconds left in the game, fresh-1
man wing Dick Edmonds made a
follow up shot to tie (he game at
the final 3-3.
Stanford coach Fred Priddle was
pleased with the team’s work. He
said that you had to single out a
man who scored two goals, but
that Paulson and freshman wing
Klaas Bergman also played ex
cellently. He called Stanford’s per
formance a team effort all the 1
way.

goal.

The Birds crowded five men in
front of the goal, but a Stanford

man edged between them, and
when shooter Ben Zinn shot, ho
moved out. Zinn’s shot went be
tween the ÜBC men, and wing Ed
Clark kicked in his first of two
goals.
CLARK’S SECOND goal came !
44 seconds later on a perfect na-ss !
from Larry Chukwudbe. The cen- j
ter cross left Clark in easy range I
on Stanford’s go-ahead score.
ÜBC tied the score at 2-2 on
Joe Johnson’s penalty kick. A
Stanford man had touched the hall
in the penalty area.
ÜBC went ahead 3-2, and Stan
ford seemingly was dead, but with |
35 seconds left in the game, fresh-1
man wing Dick Edmonds made a
follow up shot to tie (he game at
the final 3-3.
Stanford coach Fred Priddle was
pleased with the team’s work. He
said that you had to single out a
man who scored two goals, but
that Paulson and freshman wing
Klaas Bergman also played ex
cellently. He called Stanford’s per
formance a team effort all the 1
way.
Stanford’s soccer team ended its
season on a note of cautious opti
mism. The Indians earned a 3-3 tie
with (he University of British Co
lumbia Saturday on the Stanford
soccer field.

The University of British Co
lumbia often penetrated the Stan
ford half of (he field, but Stanford
was clearly the more dangerous
team, as the speedy Tribe forward
line time and again took the full
backs’ clearing kicks and bore
down on a lonely Thunderbird
goalie.

ÜBC SCORED first in the first
half, with 22 minutes gone. The
center forward headed a goal past
frosh goalie Tom Paulson to give
the Birds a 1-0 lead at the half.

Their lead was short-lived. Stan
ford scored 14 minutes after the
beginning of the second half on a
trick play. Stanford was awarded
a free kick at the goal because of
a ÜBC infraction, with the Thun
derbirds permitted to put men be
tween the Indian shooter and the
goal.
