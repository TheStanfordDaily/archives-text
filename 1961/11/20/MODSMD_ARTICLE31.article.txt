1 Outside of that, it was a close,
three-way battle, with the Indians

strong team effort. On a dual
meet basis the Cards edged out

Cal on a 26 to 29 count.
Coach Payton Jordan praised
the team running of his squad, and
pointed out that although San Jose
had once again dominated the
race, they were not as far ahead
as previously. The Stanford run
ners “have improved each week."
said Jordan. “They are at their
best stage of development and are
moving forward. We will be ready
for Cal in the Big Meet,’’ added the
coach.
The Stanford runner, after beat
ing the Bears the first two times
out this season, finished second
behind them on October 28th. They
bounced back on Friday, however-,
to outrun Cal for the third time
in four tries.
Tomorrow afternoon the two
teams will meet again, running
over the Stanford golf course. This
time it will.be the big one, “The
Big Meet.” The Card runners will
have a tough fight on their hands,
but on the basis of their late sea
son improvement, they should be
favored.
