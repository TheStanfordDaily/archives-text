# CHAPPIE RETURNS!
## Funny, Specific, 'Pure' 
### ELLINGTON K, FARTHINGALE 
With a classic cover, the
autumn Stanford Chaparral sets
what will hopefully remain the
mark of the “new Chappie"
clean, irreverent, succinct thrusts
at the officious, self-important
shield of Stanford traditions, ad
ministration and student govern
ment. It’s again a magazine at
which we can laugh instead of |
snicker.
Old Boy Brad Efron and his i
little men conclude that “It is |
better to have lived and laughed
on campus than never to have
laughed at all.”
DEFEATISM, c re e p i n g con
formity? Perhaps. Still, the Chap
arral, on sale today for 40 cents on
Quad, is clever and campus-ori
ented without the repetitive sug
gestiveness of last spring’s “Lay
boy" which immortalized that is
sue but caused the magazine’s in
evitable castigation and reorganiz
ation.
This first issue since the blood
less purge by the Dean’s office
and Legislature is themed “It’s
great to be back,” and the Farm
should concur because of the
mag’s humor and because Stan
ford needs something in these
days of new prestige and achieve- !

| ment to keep its perspective by
i laughing at itself.
THE OLD BOY sweeps past
j events under the rug in his open-
I ing statement. He appeals tp cam
j pus wits to join his staff; disre
garding old Daily-Chappie anti
j pathy, ol’ Elly fearlessly okays
| participation.
In features which rank with
j past ‘'bests” the mag presents
' "The PACE Corps,” which should
i dispel fears that PACE is com
| promising editorial freedom.
“I Am a ‘Sequoia’ Reject,” by
Judy Skinner is excellent, specific
handling of a long-vulnerable tar
j get. In “Saylorman,” a misspell
| ing-prone comic strip, ASSU per
sonalities take good-natured gas
I in, again, a feature in which spe
j cify triumphs.
SOME PARTS of the issue are
fairly banal. ‘‘The Stanford Test
—lts Cause and Cure” is trite,
I coy. The always celebrated Frosh
j Queen is cute but, in her two
page spread, unattractively cos
j turned and posed. The blurb on
! the Queen is cloying and defin
itely high school.
Moom Pitchers is back in good
style, the jokes are reasonably
new, the Four Professors are in
traditional abundance, and some
i talented new cartoonists Skib
[ il/kc, Kelsie, SCSsc! appear.
