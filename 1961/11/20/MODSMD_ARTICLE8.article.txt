will offer students an unusual opportunity to discuss—seriously and
intelligently—the possibility of peaceful existence with men who are
experts in the field.
While the programs open to the public will give a general out
line of the subject, it will he the students who pay $2 and sign up
for the seminars who will benefit in a real sense and who will
emerge from the four days knowing a great deal more about Rus
sian-U.S. relations than they previously did.
The idea of having student-led seminars with facidty or guest
speakers invited to participate in the discussions is a new one.
Assuming the student leaders and participants are well-read (as
they will he if they follow the FPI outline), the seminars shoidd
offer a unique opportunity to learn and understand the complexities
of an involved subject. It is this type of education which it is so
vital to spread on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
Anyone with a sincere interest in the possibility of coexistence
between the United States and the Soviet Union will never have a
better chance to probe the subject. All it takes to grasp that chance
is a walk over to the Union today through Wednesday and a $2
registration fee. This is a bargain of the first order.
