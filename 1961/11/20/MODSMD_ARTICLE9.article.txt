CANON GREEN
Editor, The Daily:
In the “This World” section of
the Sunday Chronicle under the
heading “Religion, the Unortho
dox Canon” I read Peter Grothe’s
canned blurb on Canon Green
which also appeared in The Daily
last Nov. 10.
Peter Grothe reports Canon
Green’s appearance on campus as
“a religious phenomenon at Stan
ford University.” “The Stanford
campus,” he writes, “hadn’t been
as enthused since the last time the
Indian football team won the Big
Game (1957).”
He also quotes a Stanford pro
fessor, well-known for telling us
how to live “life,” as saying, “In
the twenty-five years I have been
at Stanford, I’ve never seen any
one have the impact on the stu
dents that Bryan Green has.”
Canon Green is undoubtedly a
devoted and sincere man, but I
hardly think ho is a religious phe
nomenon.
Thursday afternoon in a mo
ment of confusion during the last
of his series, Bryan Green made a
regrettable Freudian slip when he
said, “Let me explain before you
think.”
Canon Green’s sweep of the cam
pus, as Peter Grothe put it, had
“the wit of an Alex Guiness com
edy.”
David Quarles
Editor, The Daily:
According to The Daily, Canon
Bryan Green declared that he
would have voted for the cruci
fixion. “I would have said, ‘Cruci
fy,’ and so would you. This is the
human fact.”
Canon Green has, of course,
every right to speak for himself,
and if he wants to project himself
into an historical past as an ac
complice at a lynching that’s his
privilege. But he should have the
humility not to speak for all of us.
Some of us don’t believe in capi
tal punishment, and some of us
don’t believe that, were we to wit
ness an innocent man geting bru
tally strung up, we would do noth
ing but cheer the mob on. To imply
that we all would have said “Cru
cify” is to take a dim view of the
possibilities of human nature.
Canon Green may, of course, be
right in his pessimism; but from
one who believes that, young men
and ladies have it within their

power to govern their own sexual
behavior, it seems strange to hear
that none of us have it within our
power to resist our thirst for mur
der.
After all, not everybody wanted
Chessman executed. Might it not
be possible that a few of us would
have given Jesus the same break?

SLOGANS
Editor, The Daily:
Slogans seem to be all the rage
in the present Better-Red-Than-
Dead controversy.
Therefore, let me present a few
of my own:
“Bilateral Concession, not Uni
lateral Capitulation”: “Give Me
Peace with Liberty”; “Is surren
der the only answer?”; “Massive
Appeasement won’t bring Mean
ingful Security”; “Neither Red nor
Dead”; “Can the world afford
peace at any price?”; “Remember
Munich”; “Could Ghandi have pre
vented the Berlin Wall?”; “Real
peace unilaterally? Co-existence
means cooperation for existence.”
“No permanent peace through pac
ifist panic!”

RED HOT PROF
Editor, The Daily:
Speaking as a law student, I
would like to take this opportuni
ty to commend all the members
of the Law School for a job well
done in the “Red Hot Professor”
contest. These men and women
showed to the University commu
nity that the apathy supposedly
rampant in graduate circles is
pure myth.
Naturally much of the motiva
tion behind the contributions was
to promote a favorite on the law
school faculty; but aside from this,
the spirit of giving to a worthy
cause, WUS, was prevalent. The
spirit of fun was there, but so too
was there cognizance of what
the money was to be used for.
The money collected is especial
ly heart-warming to me in view of
the fact that a great many of the
law students who gave are mar
ried and have families. Naturally
it was a great burden on them to
“dig deep.” But "dig deep” they
did, and I know that much lunch
time money was graciously put
into the WUS coffers.
They may have hunger pangs
(and those of us with middle-age
spread probably could stand a few
more lost lunch hours), but they
should feast upon the knowledge
that the effort and spirit shown
was “all time.”
To the undergraduates, then, I
think the law students have shown
the spirit that should and, for the
most part, does prevail on the cam
pus. To the law students well
done!

Canon Green is undoubtedly a
devoted and sincere man, but I
hardly think ho is a religious phe
nomenon.
Thursday afternoon in a mo
ment of confusion during the last
of his series, Bryan Green made a
regrettable Freudian slip when he
said, “Let me explain before you
think.”
Canon Green’s sweep of the cam
pus, as Peter Grothe put it, had
“the wit of an Alex Guiness com

According to The Daily, Canon
Bryan Green declared that he
would have voted for the cruci
fixion. “I would have said, ‘Cruci
fy,’ and so would you. This is the
human fact.”
Canon Green has, of course,
every right to speak for himself,
and if he wants to project himself
into an historical past as an ac
complice at a lynching that’s his
privilege. But he should have the
humility not to speak for all of us.
Some of us don’t believe in capi
tal punishment, and some of us
don’t believe that, were we to wit
ness an innocent man geting bru
tally strung up, we would do noth
ing but cheer the mob on. To imply
that we all would have said “Cru
cify” is to take a dim view of the
possibilities of human nature.
Canon Green may, of course, be
right in his pessimism; but from
one who believes that, young men
and ladies have it within their

power to govern their own sexual
behavior, it seems strange to hear
that none of us have it within our
power to resist our thirst for mur
der.
After all, not everybody wanted
Chessman executed. Might it not
be possible that a few of us would
have given Jesus the same break?

RED HOT PROF
Editor, The Daily:
Speaking as a law student, I
would like to take this opportuni
ty to commend all the members
of the Law School for a job well
done in the “Red Hot Professor”
contest. These men and women
showed to the University commu
nity that the apathy supposedly
rampant in graduate circles is
pure myth.
Naturally much of the motiva
tion behind the contributions was
to promote a favorite on the law
school faculty; but aside from this,
the spirit of giving to a worthy
cause, WUS, was prevalent. The
spirit of fun was there, but so too
was there cognizance of what
the money was to be used for.
The money collected is especial
ly heart-warming to me in view of
the fact that a great many of the
law students who gave are mar
ried and have families. Naturally
it was a great burden on them to
“dig deep.” But "dig deep” they
did, and I know that much lunch
time money was graciously put
into the WUS coffers.
They may have hunger pangs
(and those of us with middle-age
spread probably could stand a few
more lost lunch hours), but they
should feast upon the knowledge
that the effort and spirit shown
was “all time.”
To the undergraduates, then, I
think the law students have shown
the spirit that should and, for the
most part, does prevail on the cam
pus. To the law students well
done!

In the “This World” section of
the Sunday Chronicle under the

canned blurb on Canon Green
which also appeared in The Daily
last Nov. 10.
Peter Grothe reports Canon
Green’s appearance on campus as
“a religious phenomenon at Stan
ford University.” “The Stanford
campus,” he writes, “hadn’t been
as enthused since the last time the
Indian football team won the Big
Game (1957).”
He also quotes a Stanford pro
fessor, well-known for telling us
how to live “life,” as saying, “In
the twenty-five years I have been
at Stanford, I’ve never seen any
one have the impact on the stu
dents that Bryan Green has.”

don’t believe that, were we to wit

Canon Green may, of course, be
right in his pessimism; but from
one who believes that, young men

Editor, The Daily:
Slogans seem to be all the rage
in the present Better-Red-Than-
Dead controversy.
Therefore, let me present a few
of my own:
“Bilateral Concession, not Uni
lateral Capitulation”: “Give Me
Peace with Liberty”; “Is surren
der the only answer?”; “Massive
Appeasement won’t bring Mean
ingful Security”; “Neither Red nor
Dead”; “Can the world afford
peace at any price?”; “Remember
Munich”; “Could Ghandi have pre
vented the Berlin Wall?”; “Real
peace unilaterally? Co-existence
means cooperation for existence.”
“No permanent peace through pac
ifist panic!”

RED HOT PROF
Editor, The Daily:
Speaking as a law student, I
would like to take this opportuni
ty to commend all the members
of the Law School for a job well
done in the “Red Hot Professor”
contest. These men and women
showed to the University commu
nity that the apathy supposedly
rampant in graduate circles is
pure myth.
Naturally much of the motiva
tion behind the contributions was
to promote a favorite on the law
school faculty; but aside from this,
the spirit of giving to a worthy
cause, WUS, was prevalent. The
spirit of fun was there, but so too
was there cognizance of what
the money was to be used for.
The money collected is especial
ly heart-warming to me in view of
the fact that a great many of the
law students who gave are mar
ried and have families. Naturally
it was a great burden on them to
“dig deep.” But "dig deep” they
did, and I know that much lunch
time money was graciously put
into the WUS coffers.
They may have hunger pangs
(and those of us with middle-age
spread probably could stand a few
more lost lunch hours), but they
should feast upon the knowledge
that the effort and spirit shown
was “all time.”
To the undergraduates, then, I
think the law students have shown
the spirit that should and, for the
most part, does prevail on the cam
pus. To the law students well
done!

CANON GREEN
Editor, The Daily:
In the “This World” section of
the Sunday Chronicle under the
heading “Religion, the Unortho
dox Canon” I read Peter Grothe’s
canned blurb on Canon Green
which also appeared in The Daily
last Nov. 10.
Peter Grothe reports Canon
Green’s appearance on campus as
“a religious phenomenon at Stan
ford University.” “The Stanford
campus,” he writes, “hadn’t been
as enthused since the last time the
Indian football team won the Big
Game (1957).”
He also quotes a Stanford pro
fessor, well-known for telling us
how to live “life,” as saying, “In
the twenty-five years I have been
at Stanford, I’ve never seen any
one have the impact on the stu
dents that Bryan Green has.”
Canon Green is undoubtedly a
devoted and sincere man, but I
hardly think ho is a religious phe
nomenon.
Thursday afternoon in a mo
ment of confusion during the last
of his series, Bryan Green made a
regrettable Freudian slip when he
said, “Let me explain before you
think.”
Canon Green’s sweep of the cam
pus, as Peter Grothe put it, had
“the wit of an Alex Guiness com
edy.”
David Quarles
Editor, The Daily:
According to The Daily, Canon
Bryan Green declared that he
would have voted for the cruci
fixion. “I would have said, ‘Cruci
fy,’ and so would you. This is the
human fact.”
Canon Green has, of course,
every right to speak for himself,
and if he wants to project himself
into an historical past as an ac
complice at a lynching that’s his
privilege. But he should have the
humility not to speak for all of us.
