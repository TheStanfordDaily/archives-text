Distinguished from that.which has prac
tical application, pure research is con
cerned with the discovery of fundamental
knowledge to widen man’s understanding
of himself and the universe.
Ford Motor Company’s Scientific Labora
tory in Dearborn, Michigan is dedicated
to the pursuit of knowledge in the physical
sciences. On its staff are scientists of
national and international reputation who
conduct independent basic research pro
grams of an extremely broad nature.
Why does Ford Motor Company support
research which seemingly is unrelated to
the manufacture of its products?
It is our view, and a pioneering concept
in our Industry, that entirely new ap
proaches to automotive development can
come only from unhampered scientific
Investigation. Deeper understanding of
matter itself, and of the conversion and
storage of energy—aside from widening
man's primary knowledge—may have
practical application in tomorrow’s vehicle
design.
Thus knowledge wrested from nature by
scientists will be taken by technologists
and applied to serve practical needs and
desires. Another example of Ford's leader
ship through scientific research and
engineering.
