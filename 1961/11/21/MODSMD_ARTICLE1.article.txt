## 
### 
Tht' Inter-Club Council will recommend major revisions in the
Eating Club rushing program, Dave Dierdorff, ICC president an
nounced late yesterday.
After the Administration has reviewed the proposal, LASSU
may place it on the agenda at the end of this quarter or the begin-

ning of next.
Dierdorff emphasized that the
seven eating clubs do not have the
power to make any final decision
about rush program alterations.
THE ICC recommendations in
clude:
• An evening of open houses at
the end of autumn quarter to ac
quaint a wider section of the fresh
man class with the clubs. No par
lies will be allowed after the open
houses.
• Two night of open houses dur
ing the fourth or fifth week of win
ter quarter, with a Saturday night
all-campus dance at Toyon in hon
or of the freshmen.
• A minimum of parties during
rush week. This, according to Dier
dorff, would result in a “more
fruitful academic situation.”
THROUGHOUT spring quarter,
the eating clubs wall maintain a
policy which wdl! ease the prob
lems of “split allegiance” within
Wilbur. Freshmen pledges will not
be required to attend club meet
ings, and will be included only in
informal club functions.
A final pledge date will not be
established, as friendships during
spring quarter “often lead to fruit
ful club affiliations,” Dierdorff
said.
Dierdorff believes that the new
rush recommendation, if followed,
will make rush “a relaxed, intelli
gent, period of decision.
