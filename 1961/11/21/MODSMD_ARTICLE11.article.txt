## In What Way Does SU Challenge Ivy League? 
### CHARLES R. BEYE Assistant Professor of Classics 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is one
of a series of articles presented in
cooperation with the Stanford To
day and Tomorrow Committee on
various aspects of Farm life. Stu
dents with a, question on any part
of Stanford’s operations or Stan
ford life in general should send
them to Box 4436, Stanford.)

I have been asked in what way
Stanford represents a challenge
lo the Ivy League. The question
is probably meaningless; for, the
Ivy League may indeed be only a
state of mind, and the idea of ever
in any real sense challenging in a
conservative society such as ours
a 300-odd-year-old institution like
Harvard is impossible. What the
question then amounts to is: How
do you find teaching at Stanford
after the experience of Yale and
Harvard?
I was directed to make my an
swer in 400 words or less (the
question of enclosing box-tops
never came up) so that I trust
students of English I will forgive
my overlooking some of the nice
ties of transition they have
learned.

It will be necessary that my
reader take into account in many
of my generalizations that one
gets as students in Classics only
the brighter people, so that I have
never really on any campus met
the out and out thugs who would
inevitably dim my optimism.
MY GREATEST pleasure here
is that I teach such continually in
teresting groups of students, who
are intellectually curious, who
possess (indeed within a relatively
small range) varieties of attitudes
and values.
The students have a fundamen
tal honesty; they truly want to
learn, and they are not caught up
in the intellectual and humanistic
jargon that passes for thinking at
every cocktail party today. So
many people in Ivy League col
leges who are looking forward to
careers in advertising or other
forms of prostitution consider a
collection of humanistic facts to
have the same decorator and stat
us value as a collection of Modig
lianis. It is degrading to teach
such people; it is refreshing not to
find them here; it is frightening
to realize that they very likely in
evitably will be here.
There seems to be a distinct pol
icy at Stanford of making educa
tional requirements that will pro
duce a civilized gentleman and not
a pedant. It is grand that no sen
ior theses are required; nothing is
more tiresome than people who
know little or nothing talking on
their “field.”

DIVERSIFIED learning ought
to bo encouraged, and the unit sys
tem admirably inspires this, for it
provides the opportunity to take
smaller or larger courses depend
ing on one’s interest. It is, of
course, absurd to think one’s in
terest is equal in all matters,
which is the philosophy behind
systems that require four or five
equal courses. In order that the
University not encourage rampant
dilletantism, however, every sen
ior ought to be required to take a
two- or three-day comprehensive
examination in his major field.
The administration of the Uni
versity has demonstrated again
and again that it is interested in
the educational philosophy of the
place, and that this philosophy
should to an extent remain flexi
ble. Very likely this stems from
the very dynamic and experimen
tal first beginnings of the Univer
sity when the Stanford family re
fused to play it safe, but rather
quite daringly created a major
university overnight in Outer
Stixville.

THE MOST daring position of
the University at the present mo
ment, and one that could achieve
for Stanford a real grandeur is
that a good teacher is as impor
tant or more important than a
good scholar. The quality of teach
ing is hard to judge; printed pages,
even though never read testify to
scholarship. Timid and lazy insti
tutions look to the latter, as the

lower class looks to the chrome on
the Cadillac, to determine worth.
We all know the slogan “publish
or perish.” There seems to be a
powerful camp in the higher eche
lons at Stanford who would like to
see that cynical philosophy kept
out, but, of course, it is in the low
er depths, in the world of the many
little committees, that the matter
will bo determined.
I have remarked on some of the
virtues of Stanford that make
driving into work each day a posi
tive pleasure. In coming here I
have also had some less pleasant
surprises.

FIRST, it is extraordinary that
there is no Stanford College, but
simply a School of Humanities and
Sciences that must shove, push
and gouge for the dollars and con
cern along with the parasite
schools of law, medicine, etc., etc.

Certainly it is this that makes
the campus a colorless place; one
does not sense a Stanford, a liberal
arts college, but rather a techno
logical institute of some sort. In
deed, the administration has so
little regard for the qualities of
the atmosphere on the Stanford
campus that they cheerfully send
students off to study in Europe.
Can one imagine Harvard believ
ing that a Harvard education could
be achieved even for a brief period
in Europe? Of course not; but then
there is no such thing as a Stan
ford education; because no at
tempt has really ever been made
to integrate the intellectual, social
and spatial aspects of going to
Stanford.

The recent attempts to make
Stern and Wilbur halls into excit
ing combinations of intellectual
and social living are a step in the
right direction. Every step, of
course, is continually hampered
by the extraordinary democracy
that prevails on this campus. Stu
dents do too much planning of
their life at Stanford, and they
spend too much time at it.
THE BETTER American univer
sities represent for the majority
of their students the one and only
chance in a lifetime to experience
an environment that is not the
cheap, crass, tawdry, material, vul
gar, unintellectual and stultifying
life of the average middle-class
American.
For this reason, it is of the es
sence that the students have the
least possible say over the environ
mental conditions which they will
meet at Stanford, for they will
only bring to their decisions the
clap-trap values learned at home.
If Stanford is anything other than
a collection of buildings it must
have a point of view and this ought
to be part of the package that the
students purchase when they pay
their tuition.

Student legislatures also waste
valuable hours of learning time;
most of the matters taken up by
LASSU could be settled by any
common-sensical secretary; and so
they should. The real preparation
for a life of League of Women
Voters, Democratic Party, ACLU,
NAACP, Neighborhood League,
etc. is not LASSU, but a humanis
tic education.
THE BUSYNESS THAT charac
terizes LASSU types is probably
only a psychological resolution of
the problem that confronts anyone
from a Puritan tradition in the
face of leisure time.
The same busyness is to be
found in the mad whirl of three
quarters and jumbo assignments.
What is needed is a semester sys
tem with several weeks of reading
period at the end of each semester,
fewer assignments, more inde
pendent, loose, relaxed, and cre
ative thinking. This will work a
hardship, of course, on the less re
sponsible student, but it will be
better that his deficiencies become
more obvious earlier than later.
If Messrs. Strunk and White and
the faculty of English I will for
give me, I shall omit a concluding
paragraph, and simply stop in ask
ing two final questions: Has there
over been a major university, with
ideas, daring, imagination, and in
tellectual ferment where drinking
is banned? Can there be one?
