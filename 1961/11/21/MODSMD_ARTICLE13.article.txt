## Americans Waste U.S. Aid 
### DOUGLAS C. FRENCH IIR Political Analyst 
Earlier this fall, Congress ap
propriated $3.8 billion in foreign
aid to be distributed during the
coming year. This money will be
spent throughout the world in bet
tering the plight of the inhabitants
of those countries whose standard
of living is not the equal of our
own, and thereby to convince
these people that aligning them
selves with our side is better than
falling prey to Communism.
Ironically enough, much of the
effort spent in achieving this end
is neutralized by the attitudes and
actions of the Americans sent over
to administer the projects in
volved.

For the past two years, I have
been in Addis Ababa, the capital
of Ethiopia. During my stay, I be
came acquainted with nearly all
of the many Americans who had
been sent over by the State De
partment, International Coopera
tion Administration, and the U.S.
Army and was able to observe the
various ways in which they went
about alienating the indigenous
population.
ETHIOPIA HAS A history of in
dependence that goes hack 2,000
years and has been broken only by
the Italians in 1936. The Ethiopi
ans are a fiercely proud people and
react strongly to any insult to
their country or to themselves.
Most of the Americans I knew
there were completely insensitive
to these feelings.
American children would sit on
the walls of their compounds and
throw stones at passing Ethiopi
ans. It was not uncommon to hear
high-ranking U.S. military advis
ers loudly and profanely bawling
out their chauffeurs and servants
because they had misunderstood
complex orders in a language com
pletely different from their own.
The American wives would buy
all their food and household neces
sities at the U.S. commissary. No

shopping on the local market for
them!
AMERICANS COULD BE heard
at cocktail parties making deroga
t or y comments about “these
Ethies,” with officials of the Ethi
opian government only a few feet
away.
These innocent ambassadors
seldom ventured out of the capi
tal, and those that did always car
ried guns and blazed away at any
wild life in sight. Incidentally,
Ethiopia, being very mountainous,
has some of the most beautiful and
spectacular scenery in the world.
In all fairness, I must say that
many of the instances in which
Americans misrepresented their
country in Ethiopia are not typical
on a world wide scale. But the gen
eral situation there is the same as
that all over the world.
AMERICANS are managing to
step on I he toes of the local popu
lation in practically every country
where they are stationed and are
thereby contributing to and vali

dating Russian propaganda about
the West much more effectively
than the Russians themselves are
able to.
And just as effectively, these
people we send over are able to
render the huge sum of money
spent on foreign aid by Congress
next to useless by their ignorance
of. and indifference to local cus
tom, tradition, and just plain cour
tesy.

AMERICANS COULD BE heard
at cocktail parties making deroga
t or y comments about “these
Ethies,” with officials of the Ethi
opian government only a few feet
away.
These innocent ambassadors
seldom ventured out of the capi
tal, and those that did always car
ried guns and blazed away at any
wild life in sight. Incidentally,
Ethiopia, being very mountainous,
has some of the most beautiful and
spectacular scenery in the world.
In all fairness, I must say that
many of the instances in which
Americans misrepresented their
country in Ethiopia are not typical
on a world wide scale. But the gen
eral situation there is the same as
that all over the world.
AMERICANS are managing to
step on I he toes of the local popu
lation in practically every country
where they are stationed and are
thereby contributing to and vali

dating Russian propaganda about
the West much more effectively
than the Russians themselves are
able to.
And just as effectively, these
people we send over are able to
render the huge sum of money
spent on foreign aid by Congress
next to useless by their ignorance
of. and indifference to local cus
tom, tradition, and just plain cour
tesy.
Earlier this fall, Congress ap
propriated $3.8 billion in foreign
aid to be distributed during the
coming year. This money will be
spent throughout the world in bet
tering the plight of the inhabitants
of those countries whose standard
of living is not the equal of our
own, and thereby to convince
these people that aligning them
selves with our side is better than
falling prey to Communism.
Ironically enough, much of the
effort spent in achieving this end
is neutralized by the attitudes and
actions of the Americans sent over
to administer the projects in
volved.

For the past two years, I have
been in Addis Ababa, the capital
of Ethiopia. During my stay, I be
came acquainted with nearly all
of the many Americans who had
been sent over by the State De
partment, International Coopera
tion Administration, and the U.S.
Army and was able to observe the
various ways in which they went
about alienating the indigenous
population.
ETHIOPIA HAS A history of in
dependence that goes hack 2,000
years and has been broken only by
the Italians in 1936. The Ethiopi
ans are a fiercely proud people and
react strongly to any insult to
their country or to themselves.
Most of the Americans I knew
there were completely insensitive
to these feelings.
American children would sit on
the walls of their compounds and
throw stones at passing Ethiopi
ans. It was not uncommon to hear
high-ranking U.S. military advis
ers loudly and profanely bawling
out their chauffeurs and servants
because they had misunderstood
complex orders in a language com
pletely different from their own.
The American wives would buy
all their food and household neces
sities at the U.S. commissary. No

shopping on the local market for
them!
