WUS DRIVE
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to applaud Randy
Sugarman’s devotion to the “pri
mary purpose” of the WUS drive,
namely, “education of the entire
student body to the needs of uni
versity students throughout the
world.” To illustrate his sincerity,
we quote from the letter of a col
league, John Luce, to row repre
sentatives.
“ . . . I want to present here a
plan that will eliminate work on
your and my part. WUS is the only
charity drive this quarter, hence
contributions should be generous.
As you can see from the enclosed
material, the drive is for a worthy
cause.
“Yet it’s inconvenient to start
passing the hat, and it hardly
works; also, it’s too easy for every
one to ‘forget’ about donating. The
best way to got support from the

row is not through a big campaign,
but to put up to each house a plan
in which each member contributes
something like a dollar and the
treasurer writes one check and de
ducts the amount from the house
bills.

"Th's will eliminate any work
on the representative’s part and
should result in a good donation
from each fraternity. Tell the
house a little bit about the WUS
program and then put forth this
plan. ... I would appreciate a
check from your house treasurer
amounting to a dollar per member.
. . . If you have any questions or
can’t get the plan passed, phone
me at the Sigma Nu House; other
wise, please send the check. . . . ”
As all can see the methods and
the philosophy of the World Uni
versity Service’s drive are both
consistent and meritorious. We
suggest that there is a correlation
between their methods and “Stan
ford’s poor response. ...”

Editor, The Daily;
As a member of Kappa Alpha, I
was interested to read the letter
by law student Jerry Bernstein in
Monday’s Daily. We voted to sup
port our Faculty Adviser, Mr. Don
ald Carlson, as a house in order to
obtain greater contributions for
the WUS drive. As reported in Fri
day’s Daily, our total was $240.50,
compared to $251.80 raised by the
law students.

Now, although none of us is
married or middle-aged, it would
seem that our collection showed a
bit more “all-time spirit.” Since
we have 49 members, and the Dean
of the Law School reports 374 reg
ular students, the aver ages are as
follows: $0.66 per law student,
$4.91 per KA—a ratio of 7.4 to 1.
We don’t have to contend with
rampant graduate student apathy,
but these figures are “especially
heart-warming” to me, nonethe
less; about 7.4 times as heart
warming, in fact.

HERMANN C OLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
I am somewhat amused by the
“peculiarly simple-minded and
childishly malicious nature” of the
letters written by David Milne and
John R. Nash which attack Ross
Hermann’s recent column.
Mr. Milne criticizes Hermann
for describing several participants
in the Berkeley Student Peace Un
ion demonstration as “unwashed”
and for attempting to associate
them “with Communists.”
Mr. Nash described Hermann’s
reporting as a “supremely inept
attempt at backbiting” which ob
scured the true nature of the dem
onstration with “cute little fogs
of bigotry.”
Might I ask whether either of
the gentlemen who so authorita
tively damn the facts presented by
Mr. Hermann observed the demon
stration in Berkeley or participat
ed in it? If either Mr. Milne or Mr.
Nash personally witnessed the
demonstration, let him present
facts, and not merely opinions,
which indicate that Hermann’s re

porting was fallacious.
However, if neither of the fore
named gentlemen bothered to ob
serve the demonstration, why
don’t they simply admit that they
are totally ignorant of the hap
penings in Berkeley? In absence
of first hand information which
conflicts with that presented by
Mr. Hermann, it is evident that the
criticisms voiced by Messrs.
Milne and Nash arise solely from
their fertile imaginations. And by
the vehemence of their letters, we
can only surmise that Hermann’s
column has touched upon an ele
ment of truth which the propo
nents of the Student Peace Union
demonstration may be anxious to
conceal.
In conclusion, one might won
der how Mr. Hermann’s critics
would have him describe an un
washed, unshaven demonstrator
who went about proclaiming that
“The only answer is violent revo
lution.” Perhaps, as a person brim
ming over with “loyalty to hu
manity and civilization?”

Now, although none of us is

HERMANN C OLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
I am somewhat amused by the
“peculiarly simple-minded and
childishly malicious nature” of the
letters written by David Milne and
John R. Nash which attack Ross
Hermann’s recent column.
Mr. Milne criticizes Hermann
for describing several participants
in the Berkeley Student Peace Un
ion demonstration as “unwashed”
and for attempting to associate
them “with Communists.”
Mr. Nash described Hermann’s
reporting as a “supremely inept
attempt at backbiting” which ob
scured the true nature of the dem
onstration with “cute little fogs
of bigotry.”
Might I ask whether either of
the gentlemen who so authorita
tively damn the facts presented by
Mr. Hermann observed the demon
stration in Berkeley or participat
ed in it? If either Mr. Milne or Mr.
Nash personally witnessed the
demonstration, let him present
facts, and not merely opinions,
which indicate that Hermann’s re

porting was fallacious.
However, if neither of the fore
named gentlemen bothered to ob
serve the demonstration, why
don’t they simply admit that they
are totally ignorant of the hap
penings in Berkeley? In absence
of first hand information which
conflicts with that presented by
Mr. Hermann, it is evident that the
criticisms voiced by Messrs.
Milne and Nash arise solely from
their fertile imaginations. And by
the vehemence of their letters, we
can only surmise that Hermann’s
column has touched upon an ele
ment of truth which the propo
nents of the Student Peace Union
demonstration may be anxious to
conceal.
In conclusion, one might won
der how Mr. Hermann’s critics
would have him describe an un
washed, unshaven demonstrator
who went about proclaiming that
“The only answer is violent revo
lution.” Perhaps, as a person brim
ming over with “loyalty to hu
manity and civilization?”

WUS DRIVE
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to applaud Randy
Sugarman’s devotion to the “pri
mary purpose” of the WUS drive,
namely, “education of the entire
student body to the needs of uni
versity students throughout the
world.” To illustrate his sincerity,
we quote from the letter of a col
league, John Luce, to row repre
sentatives.
“ . . . I want to present here a
plan that will eliminate work on
your and my part. WUS is the only
charity drive this quarter, hence
contributions should be generous.
As you can see from the enclosed
material, the drive is for a worthy
cause.
“Yet it’s inconvenient to start
passing the hat, and it hardly
works; also, it’s too easy for every
one to ‘forget’ about donating. The
best way to got support from the

row is not through a big campaign,
but to put up to each house a plan
in which each member contributes
something like a dollar and the
treasurer writes one check and de
ducts the amount from the house
bills.

"Th's will eliminate any work
on the representative’s part and
should result in a good donation
from each fraternity. Tell the
house a little bit about the WUS
program and then put forth this
plan. ... I would appreciate a
check from your house treasurer
amounting to a dollar per member.
. . . If you have any questions or
can’t get the plan passed, phone
me at the Sigma Nu House; other
wise, please send the check. . . . ”
As all can see the methods and
the philosophy of the World Uni
versity Service’s drive are both
consistent and meritorious. We
suggest that there is a correlation
between their methods and “Stan
ford’s poor response. ...”

their fertile imaginations. And by
the vehemence of their letters, we
can only surmise that Hermann’s
column has touched upon an ele
ment of truth which the propo
nents of the Student Peace Union
demonstration may be anxious to
conceal.
In conclusion, one might won
der how Mr. Hermann’s critics
would have him describe an un
washed, unshaven demonstrator
who went about proclaiming that
“The only answer is violent revo
lution.” Perhaps, as a person brim
ming over with “loyalty to hu
manity and civilization?”

WUS DRIVE
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to applaud Randy
Sugarman’s devotion to the “pri
mary purpose” of the WUS drive,
namely, “education of the entire
student body to the needs of uni
versity students throughout the
world.” To illustrate his sincerity,
we quote from the letter of a col
league, John Luce, to row repre
sentatives.
“ . . . I want to present here a
plan that will eliminate work on
your and my part. WUS is the only
charity drive this quarter, hence
contributions should be generous.
As you can see from the enclosed
material, the drive is for a worthy
cause.
“Yet it’s inconvenient to start
passing the hat, and it hardly
works; also, it’s too easy for every
one to ‘forget’ about donating. The
best way to got support from the

row is not through a big campaign,
but to put up to each house a plan
in which each member contributes
something like a dollar and the
treasurer writes one check and de
ducts the amount from the house
bills.

"Th's will eliminate any work
on the representative’s part and
should result in a good donation
from each fraternity. Tell the
house a little bit about the WUS
program and then put forth this
plan. ... I would appreciate a
check from your house treasurer
amounting to a dollar per member.
. . . If you have any questions or
can’t get the plan passed, phone
me at the Sigma Nu House; other
wise, please send the check. . . . ”
As all can see the methods and
the philosophy of the World Uni
versity Service’s drive are both
consistent and meritorious. We
suggest that there is a correlation
between their methods and “Stan
ford’s poor response. ...”

Editor, The Daily;
As a member of Kappa Alpha, I
was interested to read the letter
by law student Jerry Bernstein in
Monday’s Daily. We voted to sup
port our Faculty Adviser, Mr. Don
ald Carlson, as a house in order to
obtain greater contributions for
the WUS drive. As reported in Fri
day’s Daily, our total was $240.50,
compared to $251.80 raised by the
law students.

Now, although none of us is
married or middle-aged, it would
seem that our collection showed a
bit more “all-time spirit.” Since
we have 49 members, and the Dean
of the Law School reports 374 reg
ular students, the aver ages are as
follows: $0.66 per law student,
$4.91 per KA—a ratio of 7.4 to 1.
We don’t have to contend with
rampant graduate student apathy,
but these figures are “especially
heart-warming” to me, nonethe
less; about 7.4 times as heart
warming, in fact.

HERMANN C OLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
I am somewhat amused by the
“peculiarly simple-minded and
childishly malicious nature” of the
letters written by David Milne and
John R. Nash which attack Ross
Hermann’s recent column.
Mr. Milne criticizes Hermann
for describing several participants
in the Berkeley Student Peace Un
ion demonstration as “unwashed”
and for attempting to associate
them “with Communists.”
Mr. Nash described Hermann’s
reporting as a “supremely inept
attempt at backbiting” which ob
scured the true nature of the dem
onstration with “cute little fogs
of bigotry.”
Might I ask whether either of
the gentlemen who so authorita
tively damn the facts presented by
Mr. Hermann observed the demon
stration in Berkeley or participat
ed in it? If either Mr. Milne or Mr.
Nash personally witnessed the
demonstration, let him present
facts, and not merely opinions,
which indicate that Hermann’s re

porting was fallacious.
However, if neither of the fore
named gentlemen bothered to ob
serve the demonstration, why
don’t they simply admit that they
are totally ignorant of the hap
penings in Berkeley? In absence
of first hand information which
conflicts with that presented by
Mr. Hermann, it is evident that the
criticisms voiced by Messrs.
Milne and Nash arise solely from
their fertile imaginations. And by
the vehemence of their letters, we
can only surmise that Hermann’s
