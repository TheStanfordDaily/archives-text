# Program For FPI Praised

World crisis? We are all tired of
hearing about world crisis. So fan
tastically adaptable are human be
ings that we have come to accept
world crisis as the natural order
of things. We are suspicious of So
viet peace propaganda: we would
bo uneasy if peace should actually
break out.
Is peaceful coexistence possible?
Many Stanford students would
rather not think about it. Mid
terms, Big Game, finals and vaca
tions all come and go, and they
seem much more real than commu
nism. Yet somewhere, right now,
people are fighting for their lives.
Four weeks after registration
for winter quarter, however, Stan
ford students will have a first
class opportunity to learn just
what the chances for peaceful co
existence are. For four days, from
Jan. 30 to Feb. 2, nationally-known
experts and interested students
will get together in a conference
called the Foreign Policy Institute.
C HRISTIAN HKRTER, former
secretary of state; Dr. Wolfgang
Panofsky, chairman of the Presi
dent’s nuclear testing panel; Ar
thur Dean, the United States’ dis
armament negotiator; and Dr.
John Hazard, noted authority on
the Soviet Union—these men are
among the speakers who have al
ready agreed to participate in the
Foreign Policy Institute.
The FPI is something very novel
in undergraduate education. Stu
dents will not only listen to high
level speeches and debates, they
will actively participate in student
led seminars on specific sub-topics
(Berlin. Southeast Asia, Marxist
ideology, etc.) All participants will
have abundant opportunities to
personally meet and question the
speakers.
It is a unique attempt to concen
trate talent in the study of an issue
important to everyone.
Applications for participation
are being distributed every after
noon this week from 1 to 5 p.m. in
the ASSU office. An application
foe of $2 will give you admission
to all events of the four-day con
ference as well as a conference
“packet”—so pages of background
reading on the topic, “Is Peaceful
Coexistence Possible?”
THE ONLY requirement for ad
mission is a sincere desire to learn
more about American foreign poli
cy and a willingness to devote four
days to active participation in all
the functions of the conference.
If you wish to be better inform
ed about world politics in general
and peaceful coexistence in par
ticular, you have an opportunity to
apply this afternoon at the ASSU
office.
A democracy depends upon an
informed electorate. If our democ
racy cannot come to terms with
coexistence through free discus
sion, it will surely be destroyed.
There is no more important ques
tion in our times.
