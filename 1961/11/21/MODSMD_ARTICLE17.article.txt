# UNLIMITED INJURIES
## Curtice, Levy Cry At S.F, Luncheon 
### GLENN ALFORD 
The final meeting of the Northern California Football Writers
yesterday resembled a meeting of Alphonse and Gaston.
Both Stanford’s jack Curtice and California’s Marv Levy seemed
to be trying to get their teams disqualified from participating be
cause of extensive injury lists. With the impressive lists each pre-

sented, it seems possible that they
will succeed.
CURTK'K SAID that the humps
and bruises that Stanford had
been suffering from all year fi
nally caught up with them last
Saturday.
Levy merely droned, “The less
said about the Kansas debacle,
the better.”
Curtice and chief scout “Dutch”
Fehring gave a scouting report
on California that included Cur-

Os car Donohue and Chon
Gallegos, end and quarterback
from San Jose State, were
named Northern California’s
lineman and back of tin* year.
Voting was conducted at the
weekly meeting of the North
ern California Football Writers
Luncheon, held yesterday at
Rickey’s in Palo Alto.
Cecil Coleman, who lakes an
undefeated San Francisco State
team into tlie. Mercy Bowl, was
named Coach of the Year.
Nominations from Stanford
were lineman John Butler and
hack Fd Cummings.

tice saying that with both teams
hurting, the way the ball bounces
will decide it.

HE LISTED injuries including:
Chuck Butler on crutches, Jim
Smith still struggling with a sore
shoulder, and Steve Thurlow defi
nitely out with mononucleosis,
leaving co-captain Rod Sears as
the only healthy quarterback.

Fullback Hal Steuber, still ail
ing with a broken jaw, is able to
play, but has missed a month of
practice, and is not in the best
of playing strength.
Halfback Stan Lindskog has a
chipped bone in his foot. He will
be available for placekicking, but
that is probably all. Center Chris
Cottle has a sprained ankle, and
he will have to play, since no one
can replace him.
THE TACKLE situation is bad.
A1 Hildebrand has two sprained
ankles and Frank Atkinson is
hurting with a sprained hand.
Hildebrand will improve, but At
kinson's condition might not.
The offensive ends have had to
play defense because of injuries,
but for California they may be
in top physical shape, with the
exception of Steve Pursell, who
just may play in the Big One.
But he is extremely doubtful. He
has a sprained ankle and a bad
knee.

aches, pains, etc., and may see
only limited action.
Winghack Jim Eurress, Cal’s
captain, lias a sore elbow and is
a doubtful participant Saturday.
As they say, the injured throw
away their crutches for Big
Game.

This sounds optimistic next to
Marv Levy’s statement.
QUARTERBACK Larry Balliet
is definitely unable to play
against Stanford because of a
hemorhaging eye. He was poked
in the eye by someone’s finger
while trying to bat down a pass
in the Kansas game.
George Pierovich, fullback and
workhorse of the backfield, has
an injured knee and still can’t go
at full speed. End Ron Vaughan
is returning, but hasn’t worked
out yet, so he won’t see full duty.
Randy Gold, starting quarter
back, has a pulled shoulder
muscle, but should be able to
start at full strength. As Levy
said, “He’ll have to be able to
play. We don’t have anybody
else.” Actually, Cal does have an
other quarterback in Pete Olson,
but he is as good as his one com
pletion in five passing attempts
indicates.
HALFBACKS Jerry Scattini
and Alan Nelson are ailing, and
those two are the only Cal tight
halfbacks worth mentioning.
Their line is decimated. Lauren
Bock, Norm Mac Lean, and John
Erby are all out with concussion,


BIG AL HILDEBRAND, despite two tender ankles, will give it the try
on Saturday when the Big Game finally arrives. Both teams are
suffering from many injuries, but desire usually wins this one.

BIG AL HILDEBRAND, despite two tender ankles, will give it the try
on Saturday when the Big Game finally arrives. Both teams are
suffering from many injuries, but desire usually wins this one.
The final meeting of the Northern California Football Writers
yesterday resembled a meeting of Alphonse and Gaston.
Both Stanford’s jack Curtice and California’s Marv Levy seemed
to be trying to get their teams disqualified from participating be
cause of extensive injury lists. With the impressive lists each pre-

sented, it seems possible that they
will succeed.
CURTK'K SAID that the humps
and bruises that Stanford had
been suffering from all year fi
nally caught up with them last
Saturday.
Levy merely droned, “The less
said about the Kansas debacle,
the better.”
Curtice and chief scout “Dutch”
Fehring gave a scouting report
on California that included Cur-

Os car Donohue and Chon
Gallegos, end and quarterback
from San Jose State, were
named Northern California’s
lineman and back of tin* year.
Voting was conducted at the
weekly meeting of the North
ern California Football Writers
Luncheon, held yesterday at
Rickey’s in Palo Alto.
Cecil Coleman, who lakes an
undefeated San Francisco State
team into tlie. Mercy Bowl, was
named Coach of the Year.
Nominations from Stanford
were lineman John Butler and
hack Fd Cummings.

tice saying that with both teams
hurting, the way the ball bounces
will decide it.

HE LISTED injuries including:
Chuck Butler on crutches, Jim
Smith still struggling with a sore
shoulder, and Steve Thurlow defi
nitely out with mononucleosis,
leaving co-captain Rod Sears as
the only healthy quarterback.

Fullback Hal Steuber, still ail
ing with a broken jaw, is able to
play, but has missed a month of
practice, and is not in the best
of playing strength.
Halfback Stan Lindskog has a
chipped bone in his foot. He will
be available for placekicking, but
that is probably all. Center Chris
Cottle has a sprained ankle, and
he will have to play, since no one
can replace him.
THE TACKLE situation is bad.
A1 Hildebrand has two sprained
ankles and Frank Atkinson is
hurting with a sprained hand.
Hildebrand will improve, but At
kinson's condition might not.
The offensive ends have had to
play defense because of injuries,
but for California they may be
in top physical shape, with the
exception of Steve Pursell, who
just may play in the Big One.
But he is extremely doubtful. He
has a sprained ankle and a bad
knee.

aches, pains, etc., and may see
only limited action.
Winghack Jim Eurress, Cal’s
captain, lias a sore elbow and is
a doubtful participant Saturday.
As they say, the injured throw
away their crutches for Big
Game.

This sounds optimistic next to
Marv Levy’s statement.
QUARTERBACK Larry Balliet
is definitely unable to play
against Stanford because of a
hemorhaging eye. He was poked
in the eye by someone’s finger
while trying to bat down a pass
in the Kansas game.
George Pierovich, fullback and
workhorse of the backfield, has
an injured knee and still can’t go
at full speed. End Ron Vaughan
is returning, but hasn’t worked
out yet, so he won’t see full duty.
Randy Gold, starting quarter
back, has a pulled shoulder
muscle, but should be able to
start at full strength. As Levy
said, “He’ll have to be able to
play. We don’t have anybody
else.” Actually, Cal does have an
