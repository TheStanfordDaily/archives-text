# Wallace Leads Arcos Upset Win
## 
### 
Frank Wallace’s two touch
downs led Los Arcos to a stun
ning 12-0 upset of Sigma Alpha
Epsilon yesterday.
SAE had been rated the No. 1
team in the University, while Los
Arcos had finished a close second
in the Eating Club League.
Wallace scored his first touch
down on a 20-yard run with an
intercepted pass. He iced the
game for Los Arcos by scoring in
the last six minutes of play on a
nine-yard flat pass from Chuck
Goodwin.
Wallace and linebacker Dick
Anderson held the SAE passing
attack to nil, while Phil Damask
and Jim Johnson did a fine job
on offense.
Damask had to block SAE rush

ers who outweighed him by 50
pounds, but he blocked, Goodwin
passed, Wallace caught, and Ar
cos won.

In other games, the Law School
edged Junipero 7-0. the Phi Delts
defeated the Betas 14-6 on “Cash”
Kluth’s heroics, and the Phi Kaps
beat the KA’s 26-0.
