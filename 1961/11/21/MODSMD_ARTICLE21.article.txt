astest frosh 4 miles in history for
Toach Payton Jordan’s squad, and
he third fastest of all lime for a
Jrosh on Stanford’s course, is ex
pected to lead the Indian runners.
Backing him up are six other
Tood team runners, including lour
more frosh. Harlan Andrews, one
of the freshmen, is rated as the
lumber two man. According to
Coach Jordan, Andrews has been
the most improved runner on the
team in the last two weeks. “He
was able to beat Kirkland last
week, the first Stanford runner 1o
do that in quite some time.’’
Others on the Indian scoring
team are freshman Dave Stine
back, sophomore Bill Pratt, fresh
man Paul Schlicke, senior and cap
tain of last year’s team Rich Klier,

COACH JORDAN termed the
five freshmen running today as
“possibly the best frosh group in

time were San Jose this year and
Stanford’s 1959 squad.
Other Stanford runners compet
ing today are freshmen Dave Rees,
Cliff Treese, Jim Johnson, and
Steve Wells and sophomores Dave
Stone, Jeff Johnson, Robin Ruble,
and George Fib.

Coach Jordan rated the meet al

about equal in physical condition
ing,” he said. "The team with the
greatest desire will probably come
out on top.”
