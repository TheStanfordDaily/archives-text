# The 						Day the Axe Was Won
## 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
A group of Stanford man living
in Sequoia we’d call them Stern
men now decided about 1927 that
C'al had had the Stanford Axe long
enough.
That year and the next there
were abortive coups, each barely
failing to get the Axe, but swelling
the group’s membership to 21
The Immortal Twenty-one.
THE BIG effort was set for a
Thursday evening in April, 1930,
Just before the Big (Baseball)
Series with Cal. It was planned, it
was intricate, it was secret.
The Cal people went in for axe
waving once a year in a rally be
fore the Big Series, displaying the
symbol before their multitudes to
incite all sorts of unseemly pas
sions.
When not in use, the Axe was
stored in the Berkeley branch of
the American Trust Company, and
it was carried to and from the
rallies in an armored car.
THK 21 attacked this system
from both ends. They parked a
fast car on the sidewalk in front
of the bank, with a fake camera
in the rumble seat (yes. way back
then) to make it look official, and
as an excuse for a large charge of
flash powder to he used later. Sev
eral of the 21 mixed with the Cal
frosh guarding the bank to block
the path to it from the armored
car.
Another group of 21ers watched
the Axe-waving assembly, then
rode to the bank on the armored
car carrying the Axe.
As the armored car drove up to
the bank, the camera crew shout
ed, “Move aside for a picture.”
The Berkeleyan frosh did, though
the Axe custodian remained alert.
He and his escort surveyed the
multitude, then stepped out of the
car. WHAM!
21KKS JUMPED from the ar-

mored car roof, knocking custodi
an and escort to the ground. The
flash powder was touched off,
blinding the posing frosh.
The Axe was snatched and pass
ed to Bob Loofbourow, who slipped
it under his sweater and dived into
the camera car.
That rumble-seated roadster
took off. Someone dropped a tear
gas bomb, breaking up the Califor
nian mob. With another car run
ning interference, the roadster
headed for Palo Alto at 85.
TWAS THUS that Berkeley bid
a tearful adieu to the Stanford
Axe.
The Californians milled around,
some setting off in pursuit, most
bewailing their loss. A few Stan
ford men were temporarily detain
ed. There was some fighting at a
Cal road block on the way to Palo
Alto. But Cal had lost the Axe.
The Axe near-flew back to Stan
ford; the Farm near-exploded. A
rally flowed around the living
groups, fondling and waving the
Axe. Forming before Sequoia, the
jubilant band rolled to Toyon, to
Branner, along the Row and over
to Roble.
IT WAS A wonderful chaos.
Girls leaned night-clad from the
windows, cheers were led from car
tops, latenesses and lockups and
studies were forgotten.
The nows was cheered by Stan
fordites from San Quentin to the
White House. The Axe was put in
the vaults of the American Trust
Company branch in Palo Alto.
Bank officials sent acknowledg
ment of transfer to the Berkeley
branch.
That Big Series started that Sat
urday.

THE STANFORD AXE, symbol of
Stanford's power almost since
the University’s founding, and
the coveted trophy in the annual
Big Game.
A group of Stanford man living
in Sequoia we’d call them Stern
men now decided about 1927 that
C'al had had the Stanford Axe long
enough.
That year and the next there
were abortive coups, each barely
failing to get the Axe, but swelling
the group’s membership to 21
The Immortal Twenty-one.
THE BIG effort was set for a
Thursday evening in April, 1930,
Just before the Big (Baseball)
Series with Cal. It was planned, it
was intricate, it was secret.
The Cal people went in for axe
waving once a year in a rally be
fore the Big Series, displaying the
symbol before their multitudes to
incite all sorts of unseemly pas
sions.
When not in use, the Axe was
stored in the Berkeley branch of
the American Trust Company, and
it was carried to and from the
rallies in an armored car.
THK 21 attacked this system
from both ends. They parked a
fast car on the sidewalk in front
of the bank, with a fake camera
in the rumble seat (yes. way back
then) to make it look official, and
as an excuse for a large charge of
flash powder to he used later. Sev
eral of the 21 mixed with the Cal
frosh guarding the bank to block
the path to it from the armored
car.
Another group of 21ers watched
the Axe-waving assembly, then
rode to the bank on the armored
car carrying the Axe.
As the armored car drove up to
the bank, the camera crew shout
ed, “Move aside for a picture.”
The Berkeleyan frosh did, though
the Axe custodian remained alert.
He and his escort surveyed the
multitude, then stepped out of the
car. WHAM!
21KKS JUMPED from the ar-

mored car roof, knocking custodi
an and escort to the ground. The
flash powder was touched off,
blinding the posing frosh.
The Axe was snatched and pass
ed to Bob Loofbourow, who slipped
it under his sweater and dived into
the camera car.
That rumble-seated roadster
took off. Someone dropped a tear
gas bomb, breaking up the Califor
nian mob. With another car run
ning interference, the roadster
headed for Palo Alto at 85.
TWAS THUS that Berkeley bid
a tearful adieu to the Stanford
Axe.
The Californians milled around,
some setting off in pursuit, most
bewailing their loss. A few Stan
ford men were temporarily detain
ed. There was some fighting at a
Cal road block on the way to Palo
Alto. But Cal had lost the Axe.
The Axe near-flew back to Stan
ford; the Farm near-exploded. A
rally flowed around the living
groups, fondling and waving the
Axe. Forming before Sequoia, the
jubilant band rolled to Toyon, to
Branner, along the Row and over
to Roble.
IT WAS A wonderful chaos.
Girls leaned night-clad from the
windows, cheers were led from car
tops, latenesses and lockups and
studies were forgotten.
The nows was cheered by Stan
fordites from San Quentin to the
White House. The Axe was put in
the vaults of the American Trust
Company branch in Palo Alto.
