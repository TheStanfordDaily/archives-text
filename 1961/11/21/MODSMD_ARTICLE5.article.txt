# Committee To Discuss Orientation

### 
The Academic Affairs Commit
tee will hold its first organiza
tional meting next Tuesday to
determine objectives and goals,
and to formulate policies and
projects.
First on the list for the new
committee is the start of orienta
tion of transfer students for win
ter quarter registration day.
In order to aid students who
might otherwise arrive on cam

committee will mail information
to all transfer students during
the Christmas holidays.
ON REGISTRATION day, an
information booth will be estab
lished, and committee members
will conduct tours of the campus.
Any students who have sugges
tions for this project, particularly
former transfer students, are
urged to write the committee at
the ASSU office.
The new members include rep
resentatives from all four classes,
all living groups, and a wide
range of academic interests.
They are Robb Royse, Jerry
Bernstein, Pete Jurney, Gigi Lo
baugh, Peggy Pierce, John Breck
enridge, Pat Hoobler, Beth Sum
mers, Katie Knowles.
