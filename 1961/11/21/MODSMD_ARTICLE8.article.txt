# Cal Has Our Axe! OUR Axe!
## 
### CLYDE CHRISTOFFERSON 
Gentlemen: California has our Axe! OUR
Axe!
A ten-pound broadaxe with a fifteen-inch
blade was brought in from San Francisco to
bolster spirit before a crucial baseball game
which was to lake place with Cal on April
15, 1899.
SINCE 1890, when the Axe yell was born,
an axe had been used symbolically to smash
the Cal offense, but It was now judged that
the axe had not been properly sharpened and
that this was the cause of a miserable season.
So the new Axe was officially sharpened
in a bonfire rally on April 13 and unveiled at
the Big Game on the 15th. But Cal won the
j game anyway and, to add dishonor to defeat,
stole the Axe.
It stayed at Berkeley for the next 31 year s,
i Our Axe! Big Game victories were dimmed
by Cal reminders that they had the Axe.
WE TRIED almost every year to get the
Axe back, but nothing worked. “We have the
I Axe and Stanford can’t do a thing about it.”
! they said. And they were right. For 31 years
j attempts to regain what was rightfully ours
I failed.
But on Apr il 3. 1930 the spell was broken.
I The “Immortal 21” hatched the now historic
I plot that brought the Axe back to its rightful
owners.
The day began normally at Cal. The fresh
man Axe guard escorted the Axe from theJ
1 American Trust Company in Berkeley to thcl

annual Greek Theatre Rally.
THERE IT was displayed by the “Guard
ian of the Axe.” A number of the “21” picked
their way to the front and were close by the
Axe as the Cal freshmen marched it back to
the bank.
Another contingent of the “21” posed as
photographers at the bank and asked for pic
tures of the Axe when the freshmen arrived.
The young Calslers were only too happy to
have their faces engraved on a photographic
plate, and posed nicely for the camera, which
was no more than a homemade smokobomb.
POOF! Behind the smokescreen, the Axe
was wrested from the “Guardian” and passed
through a number of hands to Bob Loofbou
row, who tucked it under his sweater and
walked unmolested to the getaway car, which
made the trip back to the Farm in 50 minutes.
The Axe was ours again. California swore
they would get it back if it took a hundred
years, but the Axe was ours. It’s amazing how
attached thieves can get to their booty.
But they did not need to steal it back.
Despite opposition from the "Immortal 21”
and the spirit of Stanford, the Administration,
in an act of foresight and treason, ended the
fun in collusion with Cal. In 1933. a pact was
drawn putting the Axe up for grabs during
Big Game and providing a stiff penalty for
further thievery.
IT WAS suggested that Cal return our
gesture by including their Golden Bear in the
Rig Game trophies, lint Cal would have none

of it.
Anyhow, the dastardly pact had been
drawn. The Axe went to the winner of the
Big Game in 1933.
In 1946, the Axe was stolen from Cal, but
was found before the Big Game in a prowl car.
In 1948 it was again stolen from Cal, this time
from a 900-pound, $7OO glass case, and aban
doned on the golf course.
DURING THE spring finals in 1953, it was
stolen again, but found in Captain Norm Ma
noogian’s car just before the game.
All this time our Big Game luck had been
sour. We had not won a Big Game since 1946.
We had not won one at home since 1935.
Finally, in 1955, we regained the Axe, only
to have it stolen from its resting place in the
Cellar. Then it was returned in time for Big
Game, only to have Cal win.
WE WON the Axe back in 1957, hut the
Axe case in the Cellar has been empty for the
past three years.
Last year, on Nov. 17, the Axe disappeared
from its almost perennial Cal home, but was
returned by unknown persons four days later.
And those Californians still have our Axe!
They’ve had it now for a total of 51 years.
Our Axe, mind you. We have had it for the
other 10 years. Is this justice?
THIS SATURDAY Stanford rooters will
be yelling “Give ’em the Axe! Give ’em the
Axe!”
GIVE ’em the Axe? ? ? ? TAKE the
Axe! ! ! !

from its almost perennial Cal home, but was
returned by unknown persons four days later.
And those Californians still have our Axe!
They’ve had it now for a total of 51 years.
Our Axe, mind you. We have had it for the
other 10 years. Is this justice?
THIS SATURDAY Stanford rooters will
be yelling “Give ’em the Axe! Give ’em the
Axe!”
GIVE ’em the Axe? ? ? ? TAKE the
Axe! ! ! !
Gentlemen: California has our Axe! OUR
Axe!
A ten-pound broadaxe with a fifteen-inch
blade was brought in from San Francisco to
bolster spirit before a crucial baseball game
which was to lake place with Cal on April
15, 1899.
SINCE 1890, when the Axe yell was born,
an axe had been used symbolically to smash
the Cal offense, but It was now judged that
the axe had not been properly sharpened and
that this was the cause of a miserable season.
So the new Axe was officially sharpened
in a bonfire rally on April 13 and unveiled at
the Big Game on the 15th. But Cal won the
j game anyway and, to add dishonor to defeat,
stole the Axe.
It stayed at Berkeley for the next 31 year s,
i Our Axe! Big Game victories were dimmed
by Cal reminders that they had the Axe.
WE TRIED almost every year to get the
Axe back, but nothing worked. “We have the
I Axe and Stanford can’t do a thing about it.”
! they said. And they were right. For 31 years
j attempts to regain what was rightfully ours
I failed.
But on Apr il 3. 1930 the spell was broken.
I The “Immortal 21” hatched the now historic
I plot that brought the Axe back to its rightful
owners.
The day began normally at Cal. The fresh
man Axe guard escorted the Axe from theJ
1 American Trust Company in Berkeley to thcl

annual Greek Theatre Rally.
THERE IT was displayed by the “Guard
ian of the Axe.” A number of the “21” picked
their way to the front and were close by the
Axe as the Cal freshmen marched it back to
the bank.
Another contingent of the “21” posed as
photographers at the bank and asked for pic
tures of the Axe when the freshmen arrived.
The young Calslers were only too happy to
have their faces engraved on a photographic
plate, and posed nicely for the camera, which
was no more than a homemade smokobomb.
POOF! Behind the smokescreen, the Axe
was wrested from the “Guardian” and passed
through a number of hands to Bob Loofbou
row, who tucked it under his sweater and
walked unmolested to the getaway car, which
made the trip back to the Farm in 50 minutes.
The Axe was ours again. California swore
they would get it back if it took a hundred
years, but the Axe was ours. It’s amazing how
attached thieves can get to their booty.
But they did not need to steal it back.
Despite opposition from the "Immortal 21”
and the spirit of Stanford, the Administration,
in an act of foresight and treason, ended the
fun in collusion with Cal. In 1933. a pact was
drawn putting the Axe up for grabs during
Big Game and providing a stiff penalty for
further thievery.
IT WAS suggested that Cal return our
gesture by including their Golden Bear in the
Rig Game trophies, lint Cal would have none

of it.
Anyhow, the dastardly pact had been
drawn. The Axe went to the winner of the
Big Game in 1933.
In 1946, the Axe was stolen from Cal, but
was found before the Big Game in a prowl car.
In 1948 it was again stolen from Cal, this time
from a 900-pound, $7OO glass case, and aban
doned on the golf course.
DURING THE spring finals in 1953, it was
stolen again, but found in Captain Norm Ma
noogian’s car just before the game.
All this time our Big Game luck had been
sour. We had not won a Big Game since 1946.
We had not won one at home since 1935.
Finally, in 1955, we regained the Axe, only
to have it stolen from its resting place in the
Cellar. Then it was returned in time for Big
Game, only to have Cal win.
WE WON the Axe back in 1957, hut the
Axe case in the Cellar has been empty for the
past three years.
Last year, on Nov. 17, the Axe disappeared

returned by unknown persons four days later.

We had not won one at home since 1935.
Finally, in 1955, we regained the Axe, only
to have it stolen from its resting place in the
Cellar. Then it was returned in time for Big
Game, only to have Cal win.
WE WON the Axe back in 1957, hut the
Axe case in the Cellar has been empty for the
past three years.
Last year, on Nov. 17, the Axe disappeared
from its almost perennial Cal home, but was
returned by unknown persons four days later.
And those Californians still have our Axe!
They’ve had it now for a total of 51 years.
Our Axe, mind you. We have had it for the
other 10 years. Is this justice?
THIS SATURDAY Stanford rooters will
be yelling “Give ’em the Axe! Give ’em the
Axe!”
GIVE ’em the Axe? ? ? ? TAKE the
Axe! ! ! !
Gentlemen: California has our Axe! OUR
Axe!
A ten-pound broadaxe with a fifteen-inch
blade was brought in from San Francisco to
bolster spirit before a crucial baseball game
which was to lake place with Cal on April
15, 1899.
SINCE 1890, when the Axe yell was born,
an axe had been used symbolically to smash
the Cal offense, but It was now judged that
the axe had not been properly sharpened and
that this was the cause of a miserable season.
So the new Axe was officially sharpened
in a bonfire rally on April 13 and unveiled at
the Big Game on the 15th. But Cal won the
j game anyway and, to add dishonor to defeat,
stole the Axe.
It stayed at Berkeley for the next 31 year s,
i Our Axe! Big Game victories were dimmed
by Cal reminders that they had the Axe.
WE TRIED almost every year to get the
Axe back, but nothing worked. “We have the
I Axe and Stanford can’t do a thing about it.”
! they said. And they were right. For 31 years
j attempts to regain what was rightfully ours
I failed.
But on Apr il 3. 1930 the spell was broken.
I The “Immortal 21” hatched the now historic
I plot that brought the Axe back to its rightful
owners.
The day began normally at Cal. The fresh
man Axe guard escorted the Axe from theJ
1 American Trust Company in Berkeley to thcl

annual Greek Theatre Rally.
THERE IT was displayed by the “Guard
ian of the Axe.” A number of the “21” picked
their way to the front and were close by the
Axe as the Cal freshmen marched it back to
the bank.
Another contingent of the “21” posed as
photographers at the bank and asked for pic
tures of the Axe when the freshmen arrived.
The young Calslers were only too happy to
have their faces engraved on a photographic
plate, and posed nicely for the camera, which
was no more than a homemade smokobomb.
POOF! Behind the smokescreen, the Axe
was wrested from the “Guardian” and passed
through a number of hands to Bob Loofbou
row, who tucked it under his sweater and
walked unmolested to the getaway car, which
made the trip back to the Farm in 50 minutes.
The Axe was ours again. California swore
they would get it back if it took a hundred
years, but the Axe was ours. It’s amazing how
attached thieves can get to their booty.
But they did not need to steal it back.
Despite opposition from the "Immortal 21”
and the spirit of Stanford, the Administration,
in an act of foresight and treason, ended the
fun in collusion with Cal. In 1933. a pact was
drawn putting the Axe up for grabs during
Big Game and providing a stiff penalty for
further thievery.
IT WAS suggested that Cal return our
gesture by including their Golden Bear in the
Rig Game trophies, lint Cal would have none

of it.
Anyhow, the dastardly pact had been
drawn. The Axe went to the winner of the
Big Game in 1933.
In 1946, the Axe was stolen from Cal, but
was found before the Big Game in a prowl car.
In 1948 it was again stolen from Cal, this time
from a 900-pound, $7OO glass case, and aban
doned on the golf course.
DURING THE spring finals in 1953, it was
stolen again, but found in Captain Norm Ma
noogian’s car just before the game.
