"HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY”
I have asked the makers of Marlboro—an enterprising and
aggressive group of men; yet at the same time warm and lovable;
though not without acumen, perspicacity, and drive; which does
not, however, mask their essential great-heartedness; a quality
evident to all who have ever enjoyed the beneficence of their
wares; I refer, of course, to Marlboro Cigarettes, a smoke
fashioned with such loving care and tipped with such an easy
drawing filter that these old eyes grow misty when I think upon
it I have asked, I say, the makers of Marlboro—that aggregate
of shrewd but kindly tobacconists, that cluster of hearty souls
hound together by the profit motive and an unflagging deter
mination to provide a cigarette forever flavorful and eternally
pleasing —l have asked, 1 say, the makers of Marlboro whether
1 might use today’s column to take up the controversial question:
Should a coed share expenses on a date?
“Yes,” said the makers simply. We all shook hands then and
squeezed each other’s shoulders and exchanged brave smiles,
and if our eyes were a trifle moist, who can blame us?
To the topic then: Should a coed share expenses on a date?
I think 1 can best answer the question by citing the following
typical case:
Poseidon Nebenzal, a student at Oklahoma A and M, major
ing in hides and tallow, fell wildly in love with Mary Ellen
Flange, a flax weevil major at the same school. His love, he had

reason to believe from Mary Ellen’s sidelong glances and
maidenly blushes, was not entirely unrequited, and by and by he
mustered up enough courage to ask her the all-important
question: “Will you wear my 4-H pin?”
“Yes,” she said simply. They shook hands then and squeezed
each other’s shoulders and exchanged brave smiles, and if their
eyes were a trifle moist, who can blame them?
For a time things went swimmingly. Then a cloud appeared.
Mary Ellen, it seems, was a rich girl and accustomed to costly
pleasures. Poseidon was bone-poor and he quickly ran out of
money. Enable to take Mary Ellen to the posh places she
fancied and too proud to tell her the reason, he turned surly and
full of melancholy. Soon their romance, so promising at the
beginning, was headed for a breakup. But at the last moment,
Poseidon managed to blurt out the truth.
“Oh, beloved agrarian!” cried Mary Ellen, grappling him
close. “Oh, proud husbandman! Oh, foolish reaper! Why have
you not told me before? I have plenty of money, and I will
contribute according to my ability.”
Poseidon, of course, protested, but she finally persuaded him
of the wisdom of her course. From then on they split all expenses
according to their incomes. Rather than embarrass Poseidon by
handing him money in public, a joint bank account was set up
to allow him to write checks. Into this account each week they
laithfully deposited their respective allowances—3f> cents from
Poseidon; $2llOO from Mary Ellen.
And it worked fine! They were happy—truly happy! And
what’s more, when they graduated they had a nice little nest
egg eight million dollars—with which to furnish a lovely
apartment in Lubbock, Texas, where today they operate the
local laundromat.
So you see? You too can salvage your failing romance if you
will only adopt a healthy, sensible attitude toward money.
Lucre is no obstacle when it comes to popular-priced
Marlboro, or to Marlboro’s popularly priced partner in
pleasure—the unfiltered, king-size Philip Morris
Commander. Get aboard. You’ll find long enjoyment for
short money.
