TABLE SHUFFLEBOARD CONTEST
Everyone Can Win up to $2.00 in 15 Minutes
The Psychology Department is conducting a study of learning
of motor skills in rather complex tasks. In order to gather the
data we want, we are conducting a TABLE SHUFFLEBOARD
CONTEST for undergraduate men. You will be asked to spend
no more than 15 minutes of your time, and each one can win
up to $2.00. Come during a study break to Room B-14 in the
basement of Cubberley—any afternoon, Monday thru Wed
nesday 1:00 to 5:00 or Monday and Tuesday evening from
7:00 to 10:00. Those who have participated in previous
shuffleboard studies are not eligible.
