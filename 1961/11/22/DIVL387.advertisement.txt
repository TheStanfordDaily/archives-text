Business and professional men appreciate
P-T’s own HERITAGE
finer natural-shoulder suits!
$B5 and $95
These men have found that high
grade, natural-shoulder clothing,
properly designed for the mature
figure, gives them a fine balance of
the “look-of-today,” with conserva
tive good taste.
At Phelps-Terkel, where our
clothing avoids any extremes in styl
ing, this trend is at its best in the
trim, comfortable lines of our Heri
tage suits, in traditional herring
bones, worsteds, and sharkskins.
We invite you to try on a Heri
tage suit, see for yourself their corn
comfort and good taste.
