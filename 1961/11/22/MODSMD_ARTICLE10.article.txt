### GLENN ALFORD 
If Jack Curtice and Marv Levy
can patch together two teams then
we’re gonna see a football game in
the Stadium Saturday, the “Big
Game.”
The story for both Stanford and
California all year has been in
juries. Both teams were on the
rise when the injury hex struck,
and now Stanford and Cal have
both lost five games in a row.
THE INDIANS and Bears both
won their last games on October
14. Stanford edged San Jose State
and Cal squeaked by Washington.
Then Stanford’s sophomore
quarterback Steve Thurlow was
stricken with mononucleosis, sen
ior quarterback Chuck Butler was
racked up, fullbacks Ken Babajian
and Tony DeLellis were hurt, and

ends Frank Patitucci, George
Honore, and Steve Pursell, all had
various aches and pains. Interior
linemen Frank Atkinson, A1 Hil
debrand, Chris Cottle, C. B. Simons
and Steve Player missed game ac
tion because of different ailments.
Hal Steuber and Larry Royse,
who broke various bones against
Michigan State, are included.
CAL DIDN’T have any really
big man out for any length of
time. Things just got so worn
down that Mel Piestrup, fifth
string tackle at the beginning of
the year, played 55 minutes
against Kansas.

Stanford's backfield has been so
riddled with injuries that Jim
Smith, third string quarterback,
has started at left half, Jay Ward,
fourth string at the start of the
year, started two games at full
back, and Bob Price, fourth string
quarterback, opened once at flank
erback.
However Connie Jarvis says
that most all of Stanford’s walk
ing wounded will be able to sec
action Saturday. Exceptions are
Chuck Butler, who i« definitely
out, and Steve Pursell whose
chances hang by a thread.
CURTICE HAS named a Stan
ford starting lineup that goes from
left to right in the line, Patitucci,
Chuck Buehler, Co-captain Tom
Walsh, Cottle, Errol Scott, C. B.
Simons and Honore.
The backfield will be composed
of co-captain Rod Sears at quarter
back, Gary Craig and Danny
Spence at halfbacks, and Ed Cum
mings at fullback.
The Golden Bears’ injury situa
tion is worse than that of Stan
ford. Top quarterback Larry Bal
liett definitely is lost to Cal. and
Randy Gold, considered by many
to be the best quarterback on the
coast, has a strained shoulder
muscle.
GOLD HAS to play, or Cal might
as well throw in the towel.
Top Cal lineman John Erhy
should be through for the year,
following a concussion suffered
against Kansas. The concussion
was the third such injury suffered
by Erby in his fotball career.
Cal’s three top halfbacks have
sundry ills. Jerry Scattini has a
charleyhorse, Alan Nelson is suf
fering with a pinched shoulder
nerve, and Jon Mason has a knee
bruise, but all will play, even
though their individual perform
ances might be hampered.
Jl>l BUHRKSS, Cal’s top de
fensive' back, with the 1 elimination
of Balliett, has a sore elbow, and
may see limited duty, if he plays
at all.
George Pierovich. all-conference
fullback last year, still has a bad
knee, but it should be at its
strongest against Stanford. His
replacement, Jim Anderson, is
just off the injury list and is ready
for the big one.
Aside from Erby, Cal’s line is at
its top strength since that begin
ning of the ydar.

TOP END Ron Vaughn, who has
missed two games, and tackles
Lauren Bock and Norm McLean,
are expected to be able to go
against the Tribe.

Levy expects to use a starting
lineup with Bob Wills, top Bear
pass receiver, and Dave Muga at
ends, Bock and Andy Segale at
tackles, Sam Stassi, replacing Er
by, and Roger Stull at guards, and
Stan Parkinson at center.

The stalling Cal backfleld in
oludes Gold, Scattini, Burress, and
Pierovich.

STULL HANDLES the Bear
punting with average ability, and
Jim Ferguson place-kicks the ex
tra points witli a skill that matches
that of Stan Lindskog. Ferguson
has booted 23 in a row through the
uprights over two years, and has
two field goals to his credit this
season.

Stanford has eight seniors who
will ■be playing their last Big
Game. The eight includes Chuck
and John Butler, Cottle, Sears,
Steuber, Walsh, Scott, and Jack
Gordon. By tradition, the gradu
ating seniors are captains for
Stanford in the Big Game.
Cal has ten men who will face

Stanford for the last time; Segale,
Burress, McLean, Ferguson, Par
kinson, Pierovich, Wills, Scattini,
Jack Trumbo, and Doug Graham.
STANFORD’S HOPES appear to
rest on the talented arms of Sears
and Smith, with the Cal secondary
weakened by the loss of Balliett,
and depending on the bruised Bur

ress.
As far as odds go, you hate to
pick a team with Stanford’s lack
of speed, but then you look at Cal’s
weakened line and—who knows?
Maybe Stanford can bring back
the “Axe” for the first time in four
years. The seniors who have never
touched it sure hope so.

Gordon. By tradition, the gradu
ating seniors are captains for
Stanford in the Big Game.
Cal has ten men who will face

Stanford for the last time; Segale,
Burress, McLean, Ferguson, Par
kinson, Pierovich, Wills, Scattini,
Jack Trumbo, and Doug Graham.
STANFORD’S HOPES appear to
rest on the talented arms of Sears
and Smith, with the Cal secondary
weakened by the loss of Balliett,
and depending on the bruised Bur

ress.
As far as odds go, you hate to
pick a team with Stanford’s lack
of speed, but then you look at Cal’s
weakened line and—who knows?
Maybe Stanford can bring back
the “Axe” for the first time in four
years. The seniors who have never
touched it sure hope so.
If Jack Curtice and Marv Levy
can patch together two teams then
we’re gonna see a football game in
the Stadium Saturday, the “Big
Game.”
The story for both Stanford and
California all year has been in
juries. Both teams were on the
rise when the injury hex struck,
and now Stanford and Cal have
both lost five games in a row.
THE INDIANS and Bears both
won their last games on October
14. Stanford edged San Jose State
and Cal squeaked by Washington.
Then Stanford’s sophomore
quarterback Steve Thurlow was
stricken with mononucleosis, sen
ior quarterback Chuck Butler was
racked up, fullbacks Ken Babajian
and Tony DeLellis were hurt, and

ends Frank Patitucci, George
Honore, and Steve Pursell, all had
various aches and pains. Interior
linemen Frank Atkinson, A1 Hil
debrand, Chris Cottle, C. B. Simons
and Steve Player missed game ac
tion because of different ailments.
Hal Steuber and Larry Royse,
who broke various bones against
Michigan State, are included.
CAL DIDN’T have any really
big man out for any length of
time. Things just got so worn
down that Mel Piestrup, fifth
string tackle at the beginning of
the year, played 55 minutes
against Kansas.

Stanford's backfield has been so
riddled with injuries that Jim
Smith, third string quarterback,
has started at left half, Jay Ward,
fourth string at the start of the
year, started two games at full
back, and Bob Price, fourth string
quarterback, opened once at flank
erback.
However Connie Jarvis says
that most all of Stanford’s walk
ing wounded will be able to sec
action Saturday. Exceptions are
Chuck Butler, who i« definitely
out, and Steve Pursell whose
chances hang by a thread.
CURTICE HAS named a Stan
ford starting lineup that goes from
left to right in the line, Patitucci,
Chuck Buehler, Co-captain Tom
Walsh, Cottle, Errol Scott, C. B.
Simons and Honore.
The backfield will be composed
of co-captain Rod Sears at quarter
back, Gary Craig and Danny
Spence at halfbacks, and Ed Cum
mings at fullback.
The Golden Bears’ injury situa
tion is worse than that of Stan
ford. Top quarterback Larry Bal
liett definitely is lost to Cal. and
Randy Gold, considered by many
to be the best quarterback on the
coast, has a strained shoulder
muscle.
GOLD HAS to play, or Cal might
as well throw in the towel.
Top Cal lineman John Erhy
should be through for the year,
following a concussion suffered
against Kansas. The concussion
was the third such injury suffered
by Erby in his fotball career.
Cal’s three top halfbacks have
sundry ills. Jerry Scattini has a
charleyhorse, Alan Nelson is suf
fering with a pinched shoulder
nerve, and Jon Mason has a knee
bruise, but all will play, even
though their individual perform
ances might be hampered.
Jl>l BUHRKSS, Cal’s top de
fensive' back, with the 1 elimination
of Balliett, has a sore elbow, and
may see limited duty, if he plays
at all.
George Pierovich. all-conference
fullback last year, still has a bad
knee, but it should be at its
strongest against Stanford. His
replacement, Jim Anderson, is
just off the injury list and is ready
for the big one.
Aside from Erby, Cal’s line is at
its top strength since that begin
ning of the ydar.

TOP END Ron Vaughn, who has
missed two games, and tackles
Lauren Bock and Norm McLean,
are expected to be able to go
against the Tribe.

Levy expects to use a starting
lineup with Bob Wills, top Bear
pass receiver, and Dave Muga at
ends, Bock and Andy Segale at
tackles, Sam Stassi, replacing Er
by, and Roger Stull at guards, and
Stan Parkinson at center.

The stalling Cal backfleld in
oludes Gold, Scattini, Burress, and
Pierovich.

STULL HANDLES the Bear
punting with average ability, and
Jim Ferguson place-kicks the ex
tra points witli a skill that matches
that of Stan Lindskog. Ferguson
has booted 23 in a row through the
uprights over two years, and has
two field goals to his credit this
season.

pass receiver, and Dave Muga at
ends, Bock and Andy Segale at
tackles, Sam Stassi, replacing Er
by, and Roger Stull at guards, and
Stan Parkinson at center.

The stalling Cal backfleld in
oludes Gold, Scattini, Burress, and
Pierovich.

STULL HANDLES the Bear
punting with average ability, and
Jim Ferguson place-kicks the ex
tra points witli a skill that matches
that of Stan Lindskog. Ferguson
has booted 23 in a row through the
uprights over two years, and has
two field goals to his credit this
season.

Stanford has eight seniors who
will ■be playing their last Big
Game. The eight includes Chuck
and John Butler, Cottle, Sears,
Steuber, Walsh, Scott, and Jack
Gordon. By tradition, the gradu
ating seniors are captains for
Stanford in the Big Game.
Cal has ten men who will face

Stanford for the last time; Segale,
Burress, McLean, Ferguson, Par
kinson, Pierovich, Wills, Scattini,
Jack Trumbo, and Doug Graham.
STANFORD’S HOPES appear to
rest on the talented arms of Sears
and Smith, with the Cal secondary
weakened by the loss of Balliett,
and depending on the bruised Bur

ress.
As far as odds go, you hate to
pick a team with Stanford’s lack
of speed, but then you look at Cal’s
weakened line and—who knows?
Maybe Stanford can bring back
the “Axe” for the first time in four
years. The seniors who have never
touched it sure hope so.
If Jack Curtice and Marv Levy
can patch together two teams then
we’re gonna see a football game in
the Stadium Saturday, the “Big
Game.”
The story for both Stanford and
California all year has been in
juries. Both teams were on the
rise when the injury hex struck,
and now Stanford and Cal have
both lost five games in a row.
THE INDIANS and Bears both
won their last games on October
14. Stanford edged San Jose State
and Cal squeaked by Washington.
Then Stanford’s sophomore
quarterback Steve Thurlow was
stricken with mononucleosis, sen
ior quarterback Chuck Butler was
racked up, fullbacks Ken Babajian
and Tony DeLellis were hurt, and

ends Frank Patitucci, George
Honore, and Steve Pursell, all had
various aches and pains. Interior
linemen Frank Atkinson, A1 Hil
debrand, Chris Cottle, C. B. Simons
and Steve Player missed game ac
tion because of different ailments.
Hal Steuber and Larry Royse,
who broke various bones against
Michigan State, are included.
CAL DIDN’T have any really
big man out for any length of
time. Things just got so worn
down that Mel Piestrup, fifth
string tackle at the beginning of
the year, played 55 minutes
against Kansas.

Stanford's backfield has been so
riddled with injuries that Jim
Smith, third string quarterback,
has started at left half, Jay Ward,
fourth string at the start of the
year, started two games at full
back, and Bob Price, fourth string
quarterback, opened once at flank
erback.
However Connie Jarvis says
that most all of Stanford’s walk
ing wounded will be able to sec
action Saturday. Exceptions are
Chuck Butler, who i« definitely
out, and Steve Pursell whose
chances hang by a thread.
CURTICE HAS named a Stan
ford starting lineup that goes from
left to right in the line, Patitucci,
Chuck Buehler, Co-captain Tom
Walsh, Cottle, Errol Scott, C. B.
Simons and Honore.
The backfield will be composed
of co-captain Rod Sears at quarter
back, Gary Craig and Danny
Spence at halfbacks, and Ed Cum
mings at fullback.
The Golden Bears’ injury situa
tion is worse than that of Stan
ford. Top quarterback Larry Bal
liett definitely is lost to Cal. and
Randy Gold, considered by many
to be the best quarterback on the
coast, has a strained shoulder
muscle.
GOLD HAS to play, or Cal might
as well throw in the towel.
Top Cal lineman John Erhy
should be through for the year,
following a concussion suffered
against Kansas. The concussion
was the third such injury suffered
by Erby in his fotball career.
Cal’s three top halfbacks have
sundry ills. Jerry Scattini has a
charleyhorse, Alan Nelson is suf
fering with a pinched shoulder
nerve, and Jon Mason has a knee
bruise, but all will play, even
though their individual perform
ances might be hampered.
Jl>l BUHRKSS, Cal’s top de
fensive' back, with the 1 elimination
of Balliett, has a sore elbow, and
may see limited duty, if he plays
at all.
George Pierovich. all-conference
fullback last year, still has a bad
knee, but it should be at its
strongest against Stanford. His
replacement, Jim Anderson, is
just off the injury list and is ready
for the big one.
Aside from Erby, Cal’s line is at
its top strength since that begin
ning of the ydar.

TOP END Ron Vaughn, who has
missed two games, and tackles
Lauren Bock and Norm McLean,
are expected to be able to go
against the Tribe.

Levy expects to use a starting
lineup with Bob Wills, top Bear
