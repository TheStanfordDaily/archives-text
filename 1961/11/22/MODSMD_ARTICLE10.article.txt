### GLENN ALFORD 
If Jack Curtice and Marv Levy
can patch together two teams then
we’re gonna see a football game in
the Stadium Saturday, the “Big
Game.”
The story for both Stanford and
California all year has been in
juries. Both teams were on the
rise when the injury hex struck,
and now Stanford and Cal have
both lost five games in a row.
THE INDIANS and Bears both
won their last games on October
14. Stanford edged San Jose State
and Cal squeaked by Washington.
Then Stanford’s sophomore
quarterback Steve Thurlow was
stricken with mononucleosis, sen
ior quarterback Chuck Butler was
racked up, fullbacks Ken Babajian
and Tony DeLellis were hurt, and

ends Frank Patitucci, George
Honore, and Steve Pursell, all had
various aches and pains. Interior
linemen Frank Atkinson, A1 Hil
debrand, Chris Cottle, C. B. Simons
and Steve Player missed game ac
tion because of different ailments.
Hal Steuber and Larry Royse,
who broke various bones against
Michigan State, are included.
CAL DIDN’T have any really
big man out for any length of
time. Things just got so worn
down that Mel Piestrup, fifth
string tackle at the beginning of
the year, played 55 minutes
against Kansas.

Stanford's backfield has been so
riddled with injuries that Jim
Smith, third string quarterback,
has started at left half, Jay Ward,
fourth string at the start of the
year, started two games at full
back, and Bob Price, fourth string
quarterback, opened once at flank
erback.
However Connie Jarvis says
that most all of Stanford’s walk
ing wounded will be able to sec
action Saturday. Exceptions are
Chuck Butler, who i« definitely
out, and Steve Pursell whose
chances hang by a thread.
CURTICE HAS named a Stan
ford starting lineup that goes from
left to right in the line, Patitucci,
Chuck Buehler, Co-captain Tom
Walsh, Cottle, Errol Scott, C. B.
Simons and Honore.
The backfield will be composed
of co-captain Rod Sears at quarter
back, Gary Craig and Danny
Spence at halfbacks, and Ed Cum
mings at fullback.
The Golden Bears’ injury situa
tion is worse than that of Stan
ford. Top quarterback Larry Bal
liett definitely is lost to Cal. and
Randy Gold, considered by many
to be the best quarterback on the
coast, has a strained shoulder
muscle.
GOLD HAS to play, or Cal might
as well throw in the towel.
Top Cal lineman John Erhy
should be through for the year,
following a concussion suffered
against Kansas. The concussion
was the third such injury suffered
by Erby in his fotball career.
Cal’s three top halfbacks have
sundry ills. Jerry Scattini has a
charleyhorse, Alan Nelson is suf
fering with a pinched shoulder
nerve, and Jon Mason has a knee
bruise, but all will play, even
