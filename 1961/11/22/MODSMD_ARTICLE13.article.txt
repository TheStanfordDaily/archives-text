# IIR POLITICAL ANALYSIS
## Yugoslav Aid Needed 
### BRUCE SILVERS IIR Political Analyst 
The recent furor emanating
from the so-called “jet plane deal”
has brought again to the fore a
country and problem which for the
past few years has been gathering
dust in drawer C of the political
crisis file. The country: Yugo
slavia. The problem: U.S. policy
toward a Communist “neutral.”

Those who oppose any contact
with Yugoslavia base their atti
tude on the no-aid-to-an-onemy
idea. This is reasonable for an en
emy but facts do not bear out Yu
goslavia’s placement in this cate
gory. At the same time the pro
ponents of “no questions asked”
aid tend to overlook the fact that
the U.S. does stand for the basic
political ideals of self-determina
tion and individual freedom. So
where to stand on Yugoslavia?
This newly unified (1918) coun
try is a strange mixture of Slavic
cultures and peoples. In it exist
the greatest contrasts of any coun
try in Europe, if not the world.

HORSED ARTS driven by peas
ants out of a Tolstoy novel rumble
along crowded boulevards side by
side with Fiats (now built in a new
Yugoslav factory) and thousands
of Western autos. The modern but
unluxurious apartment buildings
which are springing up every
where in the cities make the poor
country dwellings look even more
humble. Most city dwellers are bet
ter off than ever before while the
rural peasants continue to labor
in their traditional poverty.
The cities, especially Belgrade,
are indeed modernizing and grow
ing economically at an almost fan
tastic rate. Apartment houses, ho
tels, schools, department stores,
and factories are rising up every
where in huge projects. However,
the concentration of improvement
in the cities leaves the rural areas
little advanced over their tradi
tional indigence.
Although decollectivized (in
1948 against vehement Russian
protest) farms are having difficul
ty in trying, with antiquated
equipment and methods, to pro
duce enough food for the growing
cities. Road construction, electri
fication, and other essentials also
lag behind the general economic
growth.
IT IS IN THESE areas that Yu
goslavia now wants and needs
help. The recent sale of an atomic
reactor for generation of electric
ity is probably one of the most ap
propriately placed industrial units
in the entire U.S. aid program.
Continuation of this typo of assist

ance can only bring mutual bene
fit. Military aid is something else
again and must be considered sep
arately.
One need only go through the
border stations to recognize the
tremendous differences between
Yugoslavia and the Soviet bloc
countries. The only requirement
for an unlimited visa is a passport
and $2.50.

Once in, a traveller may go
wherever and by whatever means
he will. American movies abound
in the theaters and newspapers of

all nationalities fill the stands.
Freedom of political thought is un
restricted. but political action is
guided along state lines.
THE attitude of the common
man toward Russia indicates that
the break in 1948 was more than a
temporary disagreement. Slavic
born professors now teaching in
the U.S. almost unanimously ex
pound the opinion that Tito will
never go into the Bloc. Recent de
nunciations of Yugoslavia in the
Communist Party Congress sup
port this view. Tito’s comment
when he heard Khrushchev’s new
Communist program was “That is
all right for them as long as they
leave us alone.”
The fact that U.S. aid for once is
recognized and appreciated by
those for whom it is intended is a
rare bird in itself. There is even a
common joke circulating to the ef
fect that there is no need to worry
about the drought in the Yugoslav
farm lands this year as long as the
U.S. Midwest had a good crop.
The attitude toward 5m Ameri
can is one of the most cordial and
friendly encountered in Europe.
The USIA building in downtown
Belgrade is constantly crowded
with Yugoslavs reading the latest
U.S. newspapers, magazines, and
books, and the agency gives out
over 3,500 copies of a U.S. news
bulletin per day.
OF ALL THE considerations of
Yugoslavia’s present position in
world affairs, by far the most sig
nificant is its uniqueness as the
only non-aligned socialist country
in the world. In this capacity it is
being carefully observed by all
those under Soviet control who
might have similar aspirations for
the future.

Potentially Yugoslavia could be
a universal symbol of coexistence
and independent political develop
ment. If ever the U.S. wished to
make its foreign aid recognized
and appreciated by the recipient
country and its ‘‘stringless” bene
fits apparent to many countries,
Yugoslavia provides this oppor
tunity.

the U.S. almost unanimously ex
pound the opinion that Tito will
never go into the Bloc. Recent de
nunciations of Yugoslavia in the
Communist Party Congress sup
port this view. Tito’s comment
when he heard Khrushchev’s new
Communist program was “That is
all right for them as long as they
leave us alone.”
The fact that U.S. aid for once is
recognized and appreciated by
those for whom it is intended is a
rare bird in itself. There is even a
common joke circulating to the ef
fect that there is no need to worry
about the drought in the Yugoslav
farm lands this year as long as the
U.S. Midwest had a good crop.
The attitude toward 5m Ameri
can is one of the most cordial and
friendly encountered in Europe.
The USIA building in downtown
Belgrade is constantly crowded
with Yugoslavs reading the latest
U.S. newspapers, magazines, and
books, and the agency gives out
over 3,500 copies of a U.S. news
bulletin per day.
OF ALL THE considerations of
Yugoslavia’s present position in
world affairs, by far the most sig
nificant is its uniqueness as the
only non-aligned socialist country
in the world. In this capacity it is
being carefully observed by all
those under Soviet control who
might have similar aspirations for
the future.

Potentially Yugoslavia could be
a universal symbol of coexistence
and independent political develop
ment. If ever the U.S. wished to
make its foreign aid recognized
and appreciated by the recipient
country and its ‘‘stringless” bene
fits apparent to many countries,
Yugoslavia provides this oppor
tunity.
The recent furor emanating
from the so-called “jet plane deal”
has brought again to the fore a
country and problem which for the
past few years has been gathering
dust in drawer C of the political
crisis file. The country: Yugo
slavia. The problem: U.S. policy
toward a Communist “neutral.”

Those who oppose any contact
with Yugoslavia base their atti
tude on the no-aid-to-an-onemy
idea. This is reasonable for an en
emy but facts do not bear out Yu
goslavia’s placement in this cate
gory. At the same time the pro
ponents of “no questions asked”
aid tend to overlook the fact that
the U.S. does stand for the basic
political ideals of self-determina
tion and individual freedom. So
where to stand on Yugoslavia?
This newly unified (1918) coun
try is a strange mixture of Slavic
cultures and peoples. In it exist
the greatest contrasts of any coun
try in Europe, if not the world.

HORSED ARTS driven by peas
ants out of a Tolstoy novel rumble
along crowded boulevards side by
side with Fiats (now built in a new
Yugoslav factory) and thousands
of Western autos. The modern but
unluxurious apartment buildings
which are springing up every
where in the cities make the poor
country dwellings look even more
humble. Most city dwellers are bet
ter off than ever before while the
rural peasants continue to labor
in their traditional poverty.
The cities, especially Belgrade,
are indeed modernizing and grow
ing economically at an almost fan
tastic rate. Apartment houses, ho
tels, schools, department stores,
and factories are rising up every
where in huge projects. However,
the concentration of improvement
in the cities leaves the rural areas
little advanced over their tradi
tional indigence.
Although decollectivized (in
1948 against vehement Russian
protest) farms are having difficul
ty in trying, with antiquated
equipment and methods, to pro
duce enough food for the growing
cities. Road construction, electri
fication, and other essentials also
lag behind the general economic
growth.
IT IS IN THESE areas that Yu
goslavia now wants and needs
help. The recent sale of an atomic
reactor for generation of electric
ity is probably one of the most ap
propriately placed industrial units
in the entire U.S. aid program.
Continuation of this typo of assist

ance can only bring mutual bene
fit. Military aid is something else
again and must be considered sep
arately.
One need only go through the
border stations to recognize the
tremendous differences between
Yugoslavia and the Soviet bloc
countries. The only requirement
for an unlimited visa is a passport

Freedom of political thought is un

ing economically at an almost fan
tastic rate. Apartment houses, ho
tels, schools, department stores,
and factories are rising up every
where in huge projects. However,
the concentration of improvement
in the cities leaves the rural areas
little advanced over their tradi
tional indigence.
Although decollectivized (in
1948 against vehement Russian
protest) farms are having difficul
ty in trying, with antiquated
equipment and methods, to pro
duce enough food for the growing
cities. Road construction, electri
fication, and other essentials also
lag behind the general economic
growth.
IT IS IN THESE areas that Yu
goslavia now wants and needs
help. The recent sale of an atomic
reactor for generation of electric
ity is probably one of the most ap
propriately placed industrial units
in the entire U.S. aid program.
Continuation of this typo of assist

ance can only bring mutual bene
fit. Military aid is something else
again and must be considered sep
arately.
One need only go through the
border stations to recognize the
tremendous differences between
Yugoslavia and the Soviet bloc
countries. The only requirement
for an unlimited visa is a passport
and $2.50.

Once in, a traveller may go
wherever and by whatever means
he will. American movies abound
in the theaters and newspapers of

all nationalities fill the stands.
Freedom of political thought is un
restricted. but political action is
guided along state lines.
THE attitude of the common
man toward Russia indicates that
the break in 1948 was more than a
temporary disagreement. Slavic
born professors now teaching in
the U.S. almost unanimously ex
pound the opinion that Tito will
never go into the Bloc. Recent de
nunciations of Yugoslavia in the
Communist Party Congress sup
port this view. Tito’s comment
when he heard Khrushchev’s new
Communist program was “That is
all right for them as long as they
leave us alone.”
The fact that U.S. aid for once is
recognized and appreciated by
those for whom it is intended is a
rare bird in itself. There is even a
common joke circulating to the ef
fect that there is no need to worry
about the drought in the Yugoslav
farm lands this year as long as the
U.S. Midwest had a good crop.
The attitude toward 5m Ameri
can is one of the most cordial and
friendly encountered in Europe.
The USIA building in downtown
Belgrade is constantly crowded
with Yugoslavs reading the latest
U.S. newspapers, magazines, and
books, and the agency gives out
over 3,500 copies of a U.S. news
bulletin per day.
OF ALL THE considerations of
Yugoslavia’s present position in
world affairs, by far the most sig
nificant is its uniqueness as the
only non-aligned socialist country
in the world. In this capacity it is
being carefully observed by all
those under Soviet control who
might have similar aspirations for
the future.

Potentially Yugoslavia could be
a universal symbol of coexistence
and independent political develop
ment. If ever the U.S. wished to
make its foreign aid recognized
and appreciated by the recipient
country and its ‘‘stringless” bene
fits apparent to many countries,
Yugoslavia provides this oppor
tunity.
The recent furor emanating
from the so-called “jet plane deal”
has brought again to the fore a
country and problem which for the
past few years has been gathering
dust in drawer C of the political
crisis file. The country: Yugo
slavia. The problem: U.S. policy
toward a Communist “neutral.”

Those who oppose any contact
with Yugoslavia base their atti
tude on the no-aid-to-an-onemy
idea. This is reasonable for an en
emy but facts do not bear out Yu
goslavia’s placement in this cate
gory. At the same time the pro
ponents of “no questions asked”
aid tend to overlook the fact that
the U.S. does stand for the basic
political ideals of self-determina
tion and individual freedom. So
where to stand on Yugoslavia?
This newly unified (1918) coun
try is a strange mixture of Slavic
cultures and peoples. In it exist
the greatest contrasts of any coun
try in Europe, if not the world.

HORSED ARTS driven by peas
ants out of a Tolstoy novel rumble
along crowded boulevards side by
side with Fiats (now built in a new
Yugoslav factory) and thousands
of Western autos. The modern but
unluxurious apartment buildings
which are springing up every
where in the cities make the poor
country dwellings look even more
humble. Most city dwellers are bet
ter off than ever before while the
rural peasants continue to labor
in their traditional poverty.
