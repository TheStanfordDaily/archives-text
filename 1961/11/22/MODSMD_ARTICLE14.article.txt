# PEACE UNION REPLIES
## Hermann Column Not In Touch with Reality 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE; The follow
ing letter was sent to The Daily
by six members of the executive
committee of the Berkeley chapter
of the Student Peace Union.)

We are writing in response to
the Individual Opinion column of
last Wednesday’s paper written by
Ross Hermann. The column had
no connection with the reality of
the demonstration. The state
ments and incidents described did
not happen in the SPU demonstra
tion. If they happened at all, they
happened across the street or in
some other part of the crowd.
In order to sot the record
straight, we would like to clear up
several specific points; the only
pins worn in the demonstration
were Student Peace Union pins.
Certainly, no Castro buttons were
worn by anyone.
The direct quote attributed to
Bogdan Denitch is entirely falla
cious. The demonstration specific
ally excluded civil disobedience;
anyone who wanted to commit
civil disobedience could have done
so—outside the demonstration.
THE STATEMENT that “an ex
ecutive officer of SLATE . . .

helped organize the demonstra
tion” is false. SLATE had no con
nection with the demonstration
until the general assembly voted
to endorse it on the Wednesday
before. Every part of the planning
was done by the national and local

Student Peace Union.
Another point, not directly
brought out, but implied by Mr.
Hermann, is the question of pre
ferring to be “Red or Dead.” The
Student Peace Union is convinced
that it wants neither. Neither is a
solution to the problem of pre
serving democracy in the world at
large or at home.
Our reliance on military means
has not saved democracy; on the
contrary, it has permitted the
spread of Soviet influence
throughout Asia, Africa, Central
and South America—many times
without the Soviet Union’s even
lift ing an arm.
THIS IS, IN FACT, one reason
for the existence of the Student
Peace Union; to study means of
democratically and peacefully
stopping the spread of totalitari
anism, rather than militarily ag
gravating it.
In conclusion, we must mention
that two statements made by Mr.
Hermann are quite correct: we do
feel that the peace movement
should organize and grow at Stan
ford and elsewhere. Furthermore,
it would indeed be “an illuminating
experience” for anyone to observe
the Student Peace Union—without
any preconceived notions of our
beliefs or actions.
We would be most interested in
engaging Mr. Hermann in a public
debate at any time or place. He
can contact us by the return ad
dress on this letter.

brought out, but implied by Mr.
Hermann, is the question of pre
ferring to be “Red or Dead.” The
Student Peace Union is convinced
that it wants neither. Neither is a
solution to the problem of pre
serving democracy in the world at
large or at home.
Our reliance on military means
has not saved democracy; on the
contrary, it has permitted the
spread of Soviet influence
throughout Asia, Africa, Central
and South America—many times
without the Soviet Union’s even
lift ing an arm.
THIS IS, IN FACT, one reason
for the existence of the Student
Peace Union; to study means of
democratically and peacefully
stopping the spread of totalitari
anism, rather than militarily ag
gravating it.
In conclusion, we must mention
that two statements made by Mr.
Hermann are quite correct: we do
feel that the peace movement
should organize and grow at Stan
ford and elsewhere. Furthermore,
it would indeed be “an illuminating
experience” for anyone to observe
the Student Peace Union—without
any preconceived notions of our
beliefs or actions.
We would be most interested in
engaging Mr. Hermann in a public
debate at any time or place. He
can contact us by the return ad
dress on this letter.

We are writing in response to
the Individual Opinion column of
last Wednesday’s paper written by
Ross Hermann. The column had
no connection with the reality of
the demonstration. The state
ments and incidents described did
not happen in the SPU demonstra
tion. If they happened at all, they
happened across the street or in
some other part of the crowd.
In order to sot the record
straight, we would like to clear up
several specific points; the only
pins worn in the demonstration
were Student Peace Union pins.
Certainly, no Castro buttons were
worn by anyone.
The direct quote attributed to
Bogdan Denitch is entirely falla
cious. The demonstration specific
ally excluded civil disobedience;
anyone who wanted to commit
civil disobedience could have done
so—outside the demonstration.
THE STATEMENT that “an ex
ecutive officer of SLATE . . .

helped organize the demonstra
tion” is false. SLATE had no con
nection with the demonstration
until the general assembly voted
to endorse it on the Wednesday
before. Every part of the planning
was done by the national and local

Student Peace Union.
Another point, not directly
brought out, but implied by Mr.
Hermann, is the question of pre
ferring to be “Red or Dead.” The
Student Peace Union is convinced
that it wants neither. Neither is a
solution to the problem of pre
serving democracy in the world at
