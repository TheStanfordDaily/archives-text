HOLLANDIA, New Guinea,
Wednesday (UP!)—Hope dimmed
today that Michael Rockefeller
would be found alive in the snake
and crocodile infested mangrove
swamps of southern New Guinea
even if he made it to shore safely
through shark-filled waters.
Dr. J. Boendermaker, New
Guinea deputy governor general,
said in Hilversum, Holland, where
is is vacationing, that “it would
be a miracle if Rockefeller is found
alive” in the hostile country where
stone-age savages still hunt hu
man heads.
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller flew to
Dutch New Guinea in a chartered
jet airliner, but it appeared bad
weather over the towering New
Guinea mountains—graveyard of
World War II fighters and bomb
ers—would delay his joining the
search.

ROCKEFELLER’S chartered
Pan American airliner landed at
the wartime Japanese base of
Biak, in the Schouten Islands, off
the north coast, at 7 a.m. (2 p.m.,
PST). From there he faced a two
hour flight in a smaller plane
across the mountains to the south
ern airport of Marauke.
The governor’s exact travel
plans were uncertain. Pan Ameri
can said there was a possibility he
would fly from Biak to Port Mores
by and then across the mountains
to Marauke—a 500-mile flight con
sidered safe only two hours a day
and then only if conditions are per
fect.

The Dutch navy apparently be
lieved 23-year-old Michael had
made it safely to shore. It was con
centrating the search through the
mangrove swamps. Royal Dutch
marines moved inland with native
guides while smaller planes
searched areas offshore.

CORRECTED reports today said
Michael was only one mile from
shore and not 16 when he began
swimming inland with a make
shift gasoline can raft. But ho was
faced with a seven-knot tidal cur
rent in dangerous waters.
Observers said the Navy expect
ed Rockefeler to wait near the
coast since the nearest firm
ground is 10 miles inland. Boert
dermaker said there were so many
snakes and crocodiles in the area
he doubted a man could survive
more than a couple of days.
Two Dutch Royal Navy patrol
ships, the Tasman and the Kilff,
scoured the coastal area with the
help of a launch while patrols re
cruited from the native popula
tion explored the coastal area.
SLOW-MOVING Beaver aircraft
equipped with water skis, took
over from long-range Neptunes. A
Catalina Flying Boat lent by the
Australian government lumbered
up the coast from Port Moresby to
extend the scope of the search.
