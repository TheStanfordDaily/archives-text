A REMINDER
Editor, The Daily:
As I was running on the golf
course Saturday evening, I
chanced upon a couple clasped,
shall we say, in passionate em
brace. I would like to remind this
couple, and all other couples simi
larly minded, of the obvious dan
ger to their health to which they
are exposing themselves by ne
glecting to wear warm clothing
during these chilly nights.
