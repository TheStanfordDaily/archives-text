C ANON GREEN
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Wilfred Stone’s letter of
Nov. 20 raises some problems. He
criticizes Canon Green for saying
that wo are all responsible for the
crucifixion “as a human fact.” He
says: “To imply that we all would
have said ‘Crucify’ is to take a dim
view of the possibilities of human
nature.” But this, in fact, is pre
cisely the view that Christianity
does take. Canon Green was only
expressing in a rather vivid way
the traditional Christian doctrine
of “original sin”-—the state of man
without grace.
The only exception that might,
from a Christian perspective, be
taken to Canon Green’s statement
is its somewhat over-positive em
phasis. There are a good>many peo
ple who do not sin so much by say
ing: “Crucify,” as by saying: “I
can do nothing about this perhaps
deplorable situation.” Like Pilate,
they wash their hands. Complicity
in sin is in fact often exhibited by
indifference, refusal of risk and an
acceptance of the benefits to be
derived from an unjust society.
As one who has witnessed the be
havior of Academic Communities
under crisis, I am personally more
impressed by Canon Green’s Chris
tian pessimism than by Mr.
Stone’s extremely optimistic esti
mate of human nature.

ICC RUSH PROPOSAL
Editor, The Daily:
The story in yesterday’s Daily
reporting the recent Inter-Club
Council statement concerning
rushing changes was, unfortunate
ly, incomplete. The most impor
tant part of the proposal was com
pletely eliminated from the story.
This was the ICC’s statement con
cerning open contact. The state
ment was submitted as follows:
“The Clubs do not have, nor
should they ever have, a ‘no con
tact’ rule. We feel that any barrier
to free contact between clubmen
and freshmen serves only to facili
tate fast and faulty judgments and
decisions during the formal rush
ing period. We shall continue to de
velop our programs such that they

provide meaningful contact situa-1
tions outside of the formal open j
houses, at the same lime respect
ing the Wilbur program as a valu-1
able one and coordinating our ac- j
tivities so that they do not inter-1
fere with it.
“As the Clubs’ philosophies are
based on the individual, not the
group, we shall emphasize contact j
on an individual basis as well as [
within the framework of group ac- j
tivities. Further, we feel that some
off campus contact should be per- j
mitted, since a large percentage j
of clubmen live off campus and
we feel that the prospective mem- j
ber should be given the opportuni-'
ty to investigate all aspects of
Club life.”

Editor, The Daily:
To illustrate the uses of intelli- 1
gence, not to say of double-think, j
we see now whore even that great ■
monument to intelligence pure
and undefiled, that august person ;
who so often graces your pages,
Walter Lippmann, is enjoying in
his sere years a vision of truth not |
greatly dissimilar from the one j
that keeps Bertrand Russell so
full of beans and self-righteous
indignation toward the American
war mongers.
No, he hasn’t yet abandoned
sense entirely, to embrace puerile
nonsense with juvenile enthusi
asm, as has Russell; but his logic
in the matter of the Berlin crisis
these last months has been grow
ing less and less convincing, more
and more a compound of wishful
moralizing and syllogistic reason
ing based on stupid and unconvinc
ing premises.
One of the syllogisms he seems
to fancy is to the effect that nu-1
clear war is unthinkable, Khrush
chev will start such a war if we
don’t negotiate, therefore, we
must negotiate.
Nor does he seem to be quite suc
cessful in explaining just how a
man can be made to “negotiate,”
as we define the term, who him
self defines negotiation as the for
mal capitulation of those who ne
gotiate with him.

So vve are left to digest the in
digestablo and proceed to the con
ference table with the Russians
whose definition of negotiation
we have made clear we accept by
our public rejection of all possible
alternatives.
While Communists are patient,
they have made clear through
their history that they will not
tolerate indefinite prolongation of
negotiation even on their own

terms. They are willing to let their
adversary capitulate in graceful
stages, but at least he must have
the moral courage to capitulate;
so. in practice, Mr. Lippmann real
ly asks us to give in to the Rus
sians, only to do it as gently and
painlessly as we can aVrange it.

To illustrate the uses of intelli- 1
gence, not to say of double-think, j
we see now whore even that great ■
monument to intelligence pure
and undefiled, that august person ;
who so often graces your pages,
Walter Lippmann, is enjoying in
his sere years a vision of truth not |
greatly dissimilar from the one j
that keeps Bertrand Russell so
full of beans and self-righteous
indignation toward the American
war mongers.
No, he hasn’t yet abandoned
sense entirely, to embrace puerile
nonsense with juvenile enthusi
asm, as has Russell; but his logic
in the matter of the Berlin crisis
these last months has been grow
ing less and less convincing, more
and more a compound of wishful
moralizing and syllogistic reason
ing based on stupid and unconvinc
ing premises.
One of the syllogisms he seems
to fancy is to the effect that nu-1
clear war is unthinkable, Khrush
chev will start such a war if we
don’t negotiate, therefore, we
must negotiate.
Nor does he seem to be quite suc
cessful in explaining just how a
man can be made to “negotiate,”
as we define the term, who him
self defines negotiation as the for
mal capitulation of those who ne
gotiate with him.

So vve are left to digest the in
digestablo and proceed to the con
ference table with the Russians
whose definition of negotiation
we have made clear we accept by
our public rejection of all possible
alternatives.
While Communists are patient,
they have made clear through
their history that they will not
tolerate indefinite prolongation of
negotiation even on their own

terms. They are willing to let their
adversary capitulate in graceful
stages, but at least he must have
the moral courage to capitulate;
so. in practice, Mr. Lippmann real
ly asks us to give in to the Rus
sians, only to do it as gently and
painlessly as we can aVrange it.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Wilfred Stone’s letter of
Nov. 20 raises some problems. He
criticizes Canon Green for saying
that wo are all responsible for the
crucifixion “as a human fact.” He
says: “To imply that we all would
have said ‘Crucify’ is to take a dim
view of the possibilities of human
nature.” But this, in fact, is pre
cisely the view that Christianity
does take. Canon Green was only
expressing in a rather vivid way
the traditional Christian doctrine
of “original sin”-—the state of man
without grace.
The only exception that might,
from a Christian perspective, be
taken to Canon Green’s statement
is its somewhat over-positive em
phasis. There are a good>many peo
ple who do not sin so much by say
ing: “Crucify,” as by saying: “I
can do nothing about this perhaps
deplorable situation.” Like Pilate,
they wash their hands. Complicity
in sin is in fact often exhibited by
indifference, refusal of risk and an
acceptance of the benefits to be
derived from an unjust society.
As one who has witnessed the be
havior of Academic Communities
under crisis, I am personally more
impressed by Canon Green’s Chris
tian pessimism than by Mr.
Stone’s extremely optimistic esti
mate of human nature.

ICC RUSH PROPOSAL
Editor, The Daily:
The story in yesterday’s Daily
reporting the recent Inter-Club
Council statement concerning
rushing changes was, unfortunate
ly, incomplete. The most impor
tant part of the proposal was com
pletely eliminated from the story.
This was the ICC’s statement con
cerning open contact. The state
ment was submitted as follows:
“The Clubs do not have, nor
should they ever have, a ‘no con
tact’ rule. We feel that any barrier
to free contact between clubmen
and freshmen serves only to facili
tate fast and faulty judgments and
decisions during the formal rush
ing period. We shall continue to de
velop our programs such that they

provide meaningful contact situa-1
tions outside of the formal open j
houses, at the same lime respect
ing the Wilbur program as a valu-1
able one and coordinating our ac- j
tivities so that they do not inter-1
fere with it.
“As the Clubs’ philosophies are
based on the individual, not the
group, we shall emphasize contact j
on an individual basis as well as [
within the framework of group ac- j
tivities. Further, we feel that some
off campus contact should be per- j
mitted, since a large percentage j
of clubmen live off campus and
we feel that the prospective mem- j
ber should be given the opportuni-'

does take. Canon Green was only
expressing in a rather vivid way
the traditional Christian doctrine
of “original sin”-—the state of man
without grace.
The only exception that might,
from a Christian perspective, be
taken to Canon Green’s statement
is its somewhat over-positive em
phasis. There are a good>many peo
ple who do not sin so much by say
ing: “Crucify,” as by saying: “I
can do nothing about this perhaps
deplorable situation.” Like Pilate,
they wash their hands. Complicity
in sin is in fact often exhibited by
indifference, refusal of risk and an
acceptance of the benefits to be
derived from an unjust society.
As one who has witnessed the be
havior of Academic Communities
under crisis, I am personally more
impressed by Canon Green’s Chris
tian pessimism than by Mr.
Stone’s extremely optimistic esti
mate of human nature.

ICC RUSH PROPOSAL
Editor, The Daily:
The story in yesterday’s Daily
reporting the recent Inter-Club
Council statement concerning
rushing changes was, unfortunate
ly, incomplete. The most impor
tant part of the proposal was com
pletely eliminated from the story.
This was the ICC’s statement con
cerning open contact. The state
ment was submitted as follows:
“The Clubs do not have, nor
should they ever have, a ‘no con
tact’ rule. We feel that any barrier
to free contact between clubmen
and freshmen serves only to facili
tate fast and faulty judgments and
decisions during the formal rush
ing period. We shall continue to de
velop our programs such that they

provide meaningful contact situa-1
tions outside of the formal open j
houses, at the same lime respect
ing the Wilbur program as a valu-1
able one and coordinating our ac- j
tivities so that they do not inter-1
fere with it.
“As the Clubs’ philosophies are
based on the individual, not the
group, we shall emphasize contact j
on an individual basis as well as [
within the framework of group ac- j
tivities. Further, we feel that some
off campus contact should be per- j
mitted, since a large percentage j
of clubmen live off campus and
we feel that the prospective mem- j
ber should be given the opportuni-'
ty to investigate all aspects of
Club life.”

Editor, The Daily:
To illustrate the uses of intelli- 1
gence, not to say of double-think, j
we see now whore even that great ■
monument to intelligence pure
and undefiled, that august person ;
who so often graces your pages,
Walter Lippmann, is enjoying in
his sere years a vision of truth not |
greatly dissimilar from the one j
that keeps Bertrand Russell so
full of beans and self-righteous
indignation toward the American
war mongers.
No, he hasn’t yet abandoned
sense entirely, to embrace puerile
nonsense with juvenile enthusi
asm, as has Russell; but his logic
in the matter of the Berlin crisis
these last months has been grow
ing less and less convincing, more
and more a compound of wishful
moralizing and syllogistic reason
ing based on stupid and unconvinc
ing premises.
One of the syllogisms he seems
to fancy is to the effect that nu-1
clear war is unthinkable, Khrush
chev will start such a war if we
don’t negotiate, therefore, we
must negotiate.
Nor does he seem to be quite suc
cessful in explaining just how a
man can be made to “negotiate,”
as we define the term, who him
self defines negotiation as the for
mal capitulation of those who ne
gotiate with him.

So vve are left to digest the in
digestablo and proceed to the con
ference table with the Russians
whose definition of negotiation
we have made clear we accept by
our public rejection of all possible
alternatives.
While Communists are patient,
they have made clear through
their history that they will not
tolerate indefinite prolongation of
negotiation even on their own

terms. They are willing to let their
adversary capitulate in graceful
stages, but at least he must have
the moral courage to capitulate;
so. in practice, Mr. Lippmann real
ly asks us to give in to the Rus
sians, only to do it as gently and
painlessly as we can aVrange it.

Mr. Wilfred Stone’s letter of
Nov. 20 raises some problems. He
criticizes Canon Green for saying
that wo are all responsible for the
crucifixion “as a human fact.” He
says: “To imply that we all would
have said ‘Crucify’ is to take a dim
view of the possibilities of human
nature.” But this, in fact, is pre
