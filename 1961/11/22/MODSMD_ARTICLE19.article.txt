## 'Militant German Nationalism' Scored 
### 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This article
was submitted in reply to a recent
Campus Opinion column which ap
peared following the speech of
William 1,. Shlrer. It was written
by Craig Harrison, Philip Temko,
Fred Newman, John Vickers, John
Dolan, John Hammond and Len
nart Lofgren.)

Mr. Shirer’s challenge to the of
ficial U.S. position on the German
question deserves more serious
consideration than it received at
the hands of Messrs. Alcock, Over
dick and Saltier. They chose to ig
nore the mounting evidence of
Nazi influence in Germany.

Wo believe that this evidence is
not to bo dismissed by high-sound
ing phrases about the “complexi
ty” of the German question, or
“historical perspective.” If “his
torical perspective” means any
thing, it implies a consideration of
the historical record, and this
gives us no grounds for optimism.

To read Alcock, et al, one would
never suspect that reports of an
extremely disturbing nature have
appeared about Germany. To cite
only one source, The Californian
reports the following about Nazis
in high military positions: 31 out
of 38 generals now leading the
West German Army were mem
bers of the Nazi general staff.
General Adolf Heusinger, com
mander-in-chief of the West Ger
man Army, was formerly chief of
Hitler’s operations branch. He or
dered mass executions in Russia
in 1943. On April 19. 1961, Sen.
Wayne Morse inserted into the
Congressional Record a long cata
logue of Heusinger’s criminal ac
tivities.

General Hans Speidel, com
mander of NATO Central Land
Forces in Germany, “was head of
Western European counter-espion
age for the German general staff.

The armistice terms that he drew
up for the French in 1940 helped
to deport and murder thousands of
non-Aryans from France.”
In industry, we find that Max
Faust, “one time chief engineer of
the I. G. Farben (chemical) works
in Ausschwitz concentration camp
. . . is again a chief engineer at I.
G. Farben ...” His boss, Dr. Otto
Ambros, who heads I. G. Farben,
“directed slave laborers in con
centration camps.”

Alfriecl Knipp von Bohlen und
Halbach, who, according to For
tune (February, 1956) "actively
and flagrantly supported the
Fuehrer” obtained an early release
from prison, whereupon he ig
nored Allied orders that he sell
most of his holdings, and, in defi
ance of the deconcentration law,
now heads a vast industrial em
pire.

The New York Times comment
ed: “another deconcentration or
der against the German industrial
empires that created the Nazi war
machine has apparently been jet
tisoned ...” The military-indus
trial complex which had imposed

two devastating wars on the world
within the space of a generation,
was being revived.
In its January, 1961 issue, The
Californian reported on Nazis in
government. Among them are:
Hans Globke, “state secretary and
Adenauer’s right-hand man, draft
ed laws which were used at the
Wansee Conference of January
20, 1942 to serve as the ‘basis for
the execution of the final solution’
of the Jewish problem.”
Also Dr. Felix Gaerte, “legation
counsellor in the German Foreign
Ministry. He was SS Untersturm
fuehrer in the Reich Security Of
fice and the SS racial settlement
bureau. There he ordered the de
portation of ‘non-Aryans’ mostly
Jews, to concentration camps.”
Arc these former Nazis no long
er Nazis? After all. Franz Strauss,
Minister of Defense, who played
only a minor role during the war,
said in 1947; “Anyone who wants
to take up a rifle again should
have his hand cut off.”

But by 1952, he was saying: “The
Prussian officer is the ideal type
of German,” and more flagrantly:
“We should build more barracks,
because there alone the young
Germans receive proper citizen
ship training ... the time may well
come when barracks will be just
as important as churches.”
AS RECENTLY as 1958, Gen.
Heusinger said: “We must remem

ber our past, and we should not
neglect the decisive factors of
leadership which bring success.
Let us stick to the principles we
used to have.” This, from the pres
ent commander-in-chief of the
German Army.
Evidence of growing Nazi influ
ence in Germany is no doubt em
barrassing to Dr. Adenauer, but
that is no reason for us to ignore
it. Adenauer’s “pro-European”
policy sounds altruistic enough,
until one realizes that Germany
might well dominate any Western
European coalition, both econom
ically and militarily.
The halo disappears completely
in the face of the rising clamor for
nuclear weapons, and of repeated
encouragement of irredentist
groups by the press and by poli
ticians. These groups wish to re
cover “lost” territories which can
only be recovered by force. Is it
any wonder that neo-Nazi organiz
ations. parading openly as sueh,
should lose at the polls, when both
parties support their major de
mands anyway, and without the
stigma?

ERICH FROMM, writing on
American policy toward Europe
in the November Progressive, de
plores the fact that “the U.S. has
exchanged its friendship with a
weakened Britain for a friendship
with a strong Germany.” Fromm
urges a reversal of this policy and

warns that it would have serious
long-term consequences for the fu
ture of democracy. It would result
in a weakening of “democratic
forces,” and a strengthening of
“reactionary, totalitarian forces,”
both in Europe and in the United
States.

Time is running out on us in
Germany. Yet there is much we
could still do to bring our policy
into line with our basic, democratic
values. We ought not to recognize
or support West Germany’s claims
to “lost" territory. We should not
give in to German demands for
nuclear arms, nor should we per
mit Germany to block negotiations
over Berlin, or disengagement, or
an atom-free zone in Central Eu
rope.
In other words, it is time we
faced reality and put our own in
terests first. Instead of automatic
ally supporting every aspect of
West German policy, we ought to
discourage this resumption of
militant German nationalism,
which unchecked might drag us
into a thermonuclear war. Five
years from now, it may be too late.
