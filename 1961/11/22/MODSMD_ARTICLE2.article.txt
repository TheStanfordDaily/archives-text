# Hoebel Leans To World law
## 
### 
Mankind is moving toward cre
ating a world community with a
system of universal law strong
enough to insure security and
peace, but this ideal stage can
not be achieved until world con
science outweighs national senti
ment.

This was the gist of last night’s
Tuesday Evening Series lecture
by anthropologist E. Adamson
Hoebel.
HOEBEL traced the develop
ment of law systems from primi
tive to civilized societies in elo
quent, technical words. “The more
civilized man becomes, the
greater is his need for law,” he
said.
The savage societies maintain
order* through mutual obligation
and social control. In the complex
civilized society everything moves
to increase the potential of con
flict. Legal control supported by
force is needed to bring stability.
Hoebel said law has four func
tions: 1) to define relationships
between individuals; 2) to allo
cate authority which has the
right to use force; 3) to settle
disputes; 4) to redefine relation
ships between individuals as their
culture changes.
A SOCIETY which fails to de
velop sound legal techniques will
destroy itself, he said, citing as
an example the dissolution of the
Icelandic culture of the 10th and
11th centuries. Icelandic law had
a fatal defect, he explained, as
jury members were not disinter
ested parties.
World society today is at the
primitive level, he said. It is gov
erned not by a central agency
with authority, but merely by
accepted norms of conduct in re
lations between countries.
Our hope to achieve world
peace is to prolong the “cold”
war until mankind envelops a
world-conscience. This will be the
foundation of a universal law sys
tem which insures peace among
all peoples.
