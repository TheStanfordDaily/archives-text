HERMANN COLUMN
Editor, The Daily:
Ross Hermann’s column on the
Berkeley SPU demonstration has
evoked many screams from Liber
al well-wishers. Evidently he has
touched a vulnerable spot of truth
in the otherwise impenetrable Lib
eral armor.
I attended the rally, and I was
the one to which Hermann alluded
as a listener. We spoke with as
many people as we could, we min
gled, and we listened. The consen
sus of the rally was as it was re
ported.
I suggest that those authors of
letters attacking Hermann for be
ing “malicious” and for “backbit
ing” should know at least some
thing before they maliciously
backbite. If they attended the
rally, then they can criticize with
a legitimate background.
