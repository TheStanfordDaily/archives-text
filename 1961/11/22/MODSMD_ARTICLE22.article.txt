“The more specialists society creates to cope with its
complexities, the easier it can be for a non-specialist to
achieve success.
If that seems paradoxical, look at it this way: the more
men who go out for specific positions on the ball club,
the more chance you have to wind up as manager!
Today’s world in government, business, the arts, even
science —needs the well-rounded man. He’s the man who

can see the entire picture...the man who can draw on a
broad background of knowledge, evaluate the problem,
then assign the details to specialists.
The world of entertainment may seem somewhat spe
cial, but it's a case in point. These days, it demands more
of its people than ever before. Today’s musical comedy
score is often as sophisticated as grand opera. Drama
draws heavily on psychology and history. Television pro
ductions are concerned with nuclear science and political
science. If you’ve ever watched 'Omnibus’ you may have
seen how our productions have run the gamut of a wide
range of man’s interests.
So I suggest to you that even though you may concen
trate on one special field of interest, keep your viewpoint
broad. Keep your college curriculum as diversified as pos
sible. Attend lectures and concerts, the theatres and mu
seums. Above all, read and read, and listen and listen!
But pay scant heed to the oracle who says there’s no route
to the top but that of specialization. I don’t believe it!”
