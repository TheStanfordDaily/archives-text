### 
The Foreign Student Of
fices are looking for space on
campus for the fire-orphaned
I-Center, said Dr. Werner
Warmbrunn, foreign student
adviser.
Temporary headquarters
for the offices are in the Red
wood Cottage of the Interna
tional Center for the Advance
ment of Management Educa
tion (ICAME), located near
the steam plant at the north
end of Serra St.
When found, the new home
will serve until next Septem
ber, when the I-Center will
move into one of the frater
nity houses.
The I-Cluh Thanksgiving
trip to Carmel and Monterey
has been cancelled, but Union
residence has invited foreign
students for coffee and con
versation after the Friday eve
ning rally and Saturday game.
