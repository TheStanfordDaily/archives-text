# Beware the Bear!

### 
A strange bear in a blue-and
gold sweat shirt will challenge
Prince Lightfoot Saturday for the
attentions of the crowd. This bear,
scion of a. long line of Berkeley
cubs, bears the proud name of
“Oski.”

Oski first appeared in 1941 when
two Cal men showed up at a game
with bear masks. Now he is the
creation each year of the Oski
committee, a group of ton Cal stu
dents, all skilled acrobats under
the 5’5” limit of Oski’s costume.
They trade off the chance to
play Oski, one working before
each game and another at half
time. No one knows besides Oski
who is in the costume at any time.
THIS LACK of specific identity
makes Oski “a real live boar and
the spirit of California in the eyes
of all who have seen him.” stated
Bert Garner, chairman of the Oski
Committee.
Besides making him universal,
Oski’s anonymity saved him from
a $50,000 damage suit in 1955.
Since then he has been left free to
continue his ways, cavorting be
fore the crowd, chasing pretty co
eds, leading a blissfully beary life.
