# 'Gaieties' Akin to Dickens' Novel; Great Expectations Never Fulfilled
## 
### BRIDGET HUKSLEY DOBSON 
“Gaieties” at Big Game time is,
to me, like cotton candy at the
circus. 1 want it to be good, it
even looks as if it's going to be
good, but, alas, I soon find out
there’s not much substance to it.

Actually the 1961 “Big Game
Gaieties,” under the direction of
Doug Johnson, is worth seeing, if
only for the first act. There are
several very good moments in
Act I, and oven a few major bel
ly laughs.
Outstanding is a pantomime
called “Captain Noonday.” A1
Nobokoff in the major role has
an uncanny resemblance to our
own beloved Captain Midnight.
Joan Squires, a luscious Lady
Caraway, adds “measurably" to
the whole delightful skit.
ANOTHER scene, “Shangri La
On A Shoestring,” had me laugh
ing in spite of myself. The dia
logue lacks originality and inspir
ation, but the slapstick, though
utterly corny, is very funny.
Colin Higgins as Harry and
Phemic Brownell as Gladys are
| good comic actors as well as good
' pie-lhrowers.

A highlight of the evening is
Hoddy Guittard singing a roman
tic ballad, “From Now On.” His
rich voice is heard clearly even
though an orchestral accompani
ment does its best to smother it.
“Winnie II Gamus" is saved
from being flat and tedious by its
actors. Judy Shrader plays a de
lightfully awkward Stanfordiana,
the last virgin in Rome. Moses
Goldberg is her father-, terribly
anxious to rid himself of a clod
like daughter.
DAVE KIRK as Harvard’s Wes
tus and Carlton Tanner as Ber
serklius (a bear) are comic gladi
ators. A rousing combat is wit
nessed by a Stanford-biased cheer
ing section dressed in Roman to
gas that look strangely like muslin
muu-muus.
The entire second act drags bad
ly, After a brief orchestral inter
val. the show plunges into a senti
mental arrangement of a senti
mental song, “Poor Little Foot
ball,” of incredible childishness.
A parody of Ozzie and Harriet
in “Life in These United States” is
quite funny. Had it been half as
long it would have been twice as
good. Colin Higgins as Ozzie, Nan
cy Johnson as Harriet. Chuck
Goodwin .is Dave and Sieve Sand

lin as Rick give an amusing cari
cature of this all-American family.
THE FINALE is a hig disap
pointment. It does not follow the
Gaieties tradition of a super-colos
sal, cast-of-Ihousands-in-brilliant
red-and-white-costumes finish. In
stead it is short, and it sort of fiz
zles.
In general the musical score,
under the direction of Jim Smith,
is adequate but not inspired. The
orchestra is good when it is not
overly loud. A dancing and singing
chorus of 25 people adds spirit
throughout the evening, particu
larly in the “Twenties” skit.
Costumes by Georgia Ryther
are excellent in the “Twenties”
skit, but other than that they are
undistinguished. Barbara Greer’s
choreography is comic and good.
When the sets by May Delaficld
are enormous backdrops, they
overpower the actors. When they
are smaller, they show real imagi
nation.

TICKETS are available at the
Memorial Auditorium Box Office.
“Gaieties" opened last night and
will run through Friday, with the
curtain time 8:30 each night ex
cept Friday. Friday’s perform
ance, because of the bonfire, will
be delayed until 9:30.

long it would have been twice as
good. Colin Higgins as Ozzie, Nan
cy Johnson as Harriet. Chuck
Goodwin .is Dave and Sieve Sand

lin as Rick give an amusing cari
cature of this all-American family.
THE FINALE is a hig disap
pointment. It does not follow the
Gaieties tradition of a super-colos
sal, cast-of-Ihousands-in-brilliant
red-and-white-costumes finish. In
stead it is short, and it sort of fiz
zles.
In general the musical score,
under the direction of Jim Smith,
is adequate but not inspired. The
orchestra is good when it is not
overly loud. A dancing and singing
chorus of 25 people adds spirit
throughout the evening, particu
larly in the “Twenties” skit.
Costumes by Georgia Ryther
are excellent in the “Twenties”
skit, but other than that they are
undistinguished. Barbara Greer’s
choreography is comic and good.
When the sets by May Delaficld
are enormous backdrops, they
overpower the actors. When they
are smaller, they show real imagi
nation.

TICKETS are available at the
Memorial Auditorium Box Office.
“Gaieties" opened last night and
will run through Friday, with the
curtain time 8:30 each night ex
cept Friday. Friday’s perform
ance, because of the bonfire, will
be delayed until 9:30.
“Gaieties” at Big Game time is,
to me, like cotton candy at the
circus. 1 want it to be good, it
even looks as if it's going to be
good, but, alas, I soon find out
there’s not much substance to it.

Actually the 1961 “Big Game
Gaieties,” under the direction of
Doug Johnson, is worth seeing, if
only for the first act. There are
several very good moments in
Act I, and oven a few major bel
ly laughs.
Outstanding is a pantomime
called “Captain Noonday.” A1
Nobokoff in the major role has
an uncanny resemblance to our
own beloved Captain Midnight.
Joan Squires, a luscious Lady
Caraway, adds “measurably" to
the whole delightful skit.
ANOTHER scene, “Shangri La
On A Shoestring,” had me laugh
ing in spite of myself. The dia
logue lacks originality and inspir
ation, but the slapstick, though
utterly corny, is very funny.
Colin Higgins as Harry and
Phemic Brownell as Gladys are
| good comic actors as well as good
' pie-lhrowers.

A highlight of the evening is
Hoddy Guittard singing a roman
tic ballad, “From Now On.” His
rich voice is heard clearly even
though an orchestral accompani
ment does its best to smother it.
“Winnie II Gamus" is saved
from being flat and tedious by its
actors. Judy Shrader plays a de
lightfully awkward Stanfordiana,
the last virgin in Rome. Moses
Goldberg is her father-, terribly
anxious to rid himself of a clod
like daughter.
DAVE KIRK as Harvard’s Wes
tus and Carlton Tanner as Ber
serklius (a bear) are comic gladi
ators. A rousing combat is wit
nessed by a Stanford-biased cheer
ing section dressed in Roman to
gas that look strangely like muslin
muu-muus.
The entire second act drags bad
ly, After a brief orchestral inter
val. the show plunges into a senti
mental arrangement of a senti
mental song, “Poor Little Foot
ball,” of incredible childishness.
A parody of Ozzie and Harriet
in “Life in These United States” is
quite funny. Had it been half as
long it would have been twice as
good. Colin Higgins as Ozzie, Nan
cy Johnson as Harriet. Chuck
Goodwin .is Dave and Sieve Sand
