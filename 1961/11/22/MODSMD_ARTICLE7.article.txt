# Frosh to Burn Cal 'Campanile'
## 
### 
.The Big Game bonfire, tradi
tionally an amorphous mass of
junk lumber three stories high,
this year will take on a more pre
cise look.
It will be built 20 feet square
and 50 feet high to represent the
Campanile at UC. The “Campa
nile” will be built of plywood
sheets, painted with a clock face
and windows, and faced toward
the boathouse dock.
The new plan was devised to
sharpen the satire and to end the
long and sometimes dangerous
hours of guarding the bonfire ma
terial.
As in the past, PG&E crewmen
will plant the tall power poles
which form the framework. The
Shell Oil Co. will not supply the
traditional aerial display of fire
works this year.
Th e bonfire rally gets under
way at 6:30 p.m. on the Boathouse
dock, with the band, yell leaders,
mascot Prince Lightfoot, the Four
Professors, and Stanford’s Bob
Mathias, Olympic decathlon
champ and TV star, as master of
ceremonies.

The guest of honor will be Bob
Reynolds, who Saturday at half
time will be installed as Stanford’s
fifth member of the National Foot
ball Hall of Fame. Reynolds was a
member of the near-legendary
“Vow Boys,” who as freshmen in
1932 vowed not to lose a game to
USC. In their three years on the
varsity team the vow boys lost
only 4 games out of 31, and played
in the Rose Bowl all three years.
At the rally the story of the Axe
will be told by Howard Avery, one
of the “Immortal 21.”
