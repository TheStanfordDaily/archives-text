# Big Game of '92 Was SU Grid Triumph
## 
### EDWARD MACKAY 
This coming Saturday, Stanford
and the University of California
will meet for their 64th Big Game.
This traditional rivalry has con
tinued, with interruptions for
World Wars I and 11. since 1892.
Although Stanford has not al
ways been successful in these foot
ball games, we do have the satis
faction of knowing we won the
first ohe ever played. It’s like put
ting up the first satellite—every
one after it isn’t quite the same.
THE IDEA of a rivalry was in
itiated by Roy Gallagher, the UC
football team manager. He had
been looking for - a suitable oppo
nent for Cal along the lines of the
Yale-Harvard rivalry. When Stan
ford University opened in 1891, he
‘was delighted and sent a challenge
through friends who had enrolled
there.
The challenge became the talk
of Stanford, as no football team
existed. However, good players
were found among the student
body. J. R. Whittemore, a gradu
ate student from St. Louis Univer
sity, was elected captain of the
new team.
A group of students who had at
tended Lowell High School in San
Francisco brought its school color
with them, and Stanford has used
it ever since.
THE GAME was scheduled for
March 19. 1892 so the team could
have enough time to practice and
get into shape.
When the day came, both teams
arrived at the Haight Street field
in San Francisco from their hotels.
The field in the City had been
chosen because there was no field
at Stanford, and because it served
as a convenient neutral half-way
point between the two schools.
An unexpectedly large number
of people attended. In the confu
sion only one thing was forgotten
—a football. The substitute which
was produced had a I’egulation
outer covering, but inside was a
punching bag bladder. It was odd
ly shaped, which accounts for the
fact that only one conversion was
kicked with it (by Whittemore).
Stanford’s C. S. Downing scored
first on a long run down the side
line. This was an era of over-the
center plays, and a hand-off came
as a complete surprise.
THERE was great celebrating
all over San Francisco that night,
which Cal supporters eventually
joined. Representatives stayed up
dividing the take between the
schools. Representing Cal was
Herbert Lang, and from Stanford
came Herbert Hoover.
Since then Stanford has won 23
games, lost 28, and tied 10. Twelve
of these were rugby, of which
Stanford won 8, lost 3, and tied 1.
Let’s hope we catch up soon
starting this year?
