# More Gallaghers Needed in Education
## 
### 
Stanford was scheduled today to host a rarity in the field of pub
lic education—a man who doesn’t hesitate to say what he thinks and
one who has refused to buckle under pressure brought on him by
the lunatic fringe off to the right which has been so active in Cali
fornia of late.

The man is Dr. Buell C. Gallagher, recently appointed chan
cellor of the State College System. This tall, spare gentleman has
come under heavy fire and been viciously attacked by this state’s
extremists of the John Birch order, who oppose his views on loyalty
oaths, freedom in student political activity and his stand on allow
ing Communists to speak on state college campuses. Unfortunately,
his talk has heen cancelled. It would have been worth hearing, and
we hope he can be brought to campus later this year.
Dr. Gallagher has stated in the past that ho has little regard for
special student loyalty oaths and feels students should be allowed
a wide degree of freedom in their political activities on campus.
This, of course, immediately makes him suspect to various
groups who under the guise of defending the Constitution would
destroy its basic principles. But what has really prompted the out
burst of name-calling and smear tactics on the part of these groups
is his belief that Communists should be allowed to speak in open
meetings on state college campuses.
Dr. Gallagher apparently feels that college students will not
emerge from hearing an identified Communist as dedicated agents
of the Kremlin, but rather as better informed students and Ameri
can citizens.
Certainly there is no better place for college students to hear a
Communist speak than on a college campus where a commitment
to free interchange of ideas supposedly holds sway, and where stu
dents would be able to learn something from hearing a Communist
deliver the party’s point of view on various matters.
It is about time the fear-ridden extremists learn that a college
or univeristy education should teach the student how to think, not
what to think. By barring members of a certain group from speak
ing on a college campus we are both defeating the purpose of edu
cation and limiting the choice of ideas available to students. This
type of action is characteristic of totalitarian societies-and unchar
acteristic of truly free societies.
We congratulate Dr. Gallagher for his firm stand and admire
him for sticking to his guns, rather than bowing to pressure as so
many timid public educators do. Education—both public and pri
vate—could use more men of his caliber.
