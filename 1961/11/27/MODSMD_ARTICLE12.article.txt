# Seniors Worked for Win
## 
### 
The younger generation has it too easy. Take this year’s fresh
man class, for instance. They don’t know what it is to sweat and
bleed for a Rig Game victory. They got their win over Cal their very
first year.
On the other hand, the senior class really had to work for their
Big Game win. For three years they sat through defeats and most
of them were convinced that a Big Game win in their undergrad
uate lifetime was destined never to be. They know what heartbreak
and despair mean.
The seniors know what it means to have a referee steal a Big
Came from you. They know what it means to complete a quarter
of a mile’s worth of passes in one game and still lose.
The freshmen? They only know victory. It is, indeed, a sad com
mentary on the increasing frivolousness of youth when such a state
of affairs is allowed to exist. One wonders if the freshmen even
have a right to this win.
But, for the seniors, it was a glorious win. As alumni, may they
see many more.
