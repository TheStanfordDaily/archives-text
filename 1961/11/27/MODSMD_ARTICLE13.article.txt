## 
### 
BERLIN (UPl)—East German
Communist chief Walter Ulbricht
maintained in a speech published
yesterday that Big Three Allied
rights in Berlin are dead and ruled
out de facto recognition of his re
gime as a Western bargaining
point in any East-West negotia
tions.
Ulbricht’s report to the East
German Central Committee on the
recent Soviet Party Congress in
Moscow spiked speculation that
the Communists may have eased
their stand on Berlin and Ger
many, informed sources said. The
report was published by the offi
cial German Communist party
newspaper Neues Deutschland.
THE SOURCES SAID Ulbricht
probably was outlining the latest
views of Soviet Premier Nikita S.
Khrushchev on the issue. It was
noted that he restated demands—
including a confederation of East
and West Germany rather than a
union—which the Reds have been
proposing for years.
The bearded chief of state of the
German puppet regime said that
East-West negotiations will be
concerned primarily with finding

means by which the United States,
Britain and France can cut down
(heir Berlin garrisons without los
ing face.
He also reasserted East German
claims to sovereignty and control
of all access routes to and from
Berlin whether by land, water or
air.
But West German Chancellor
Konrad Adenauer assured Berlin
ers that they could depend on the
United States to defend their free
dom. In a farewell telegram sent
Wednesday to President Kennedy
and made public yesterday, Ade
nauer emphasized his faith and
trust in America.
HE SAID “I have seldom left
the White House as happy and as
easy in mind as at this time.”
“ ... I want to repeat how much
my talks with you strengthened
and encouraged me.” Adenauer’s
message said. “The great efforts
of the American people to main
tain an honorable peace in free
dom, and the seriousness of your
determination greatly impressed
me.

“We trust the United States,
You will be able to rely on us.”
