# Reading Plan Starts Kids Off With Alphabet

### 
NEW YORK (UPI)—An experi
mental edition of a “revolution
ary” theory in reading instruction
reached the bookstores this month,
23 years after its first use and 13
years after the death of its author,
a noted professor of linguistics.
It starts out by teaching young
sters the alphabet. N
From there the learner begins
to spell out three-letter words.
The Bloomfield system was de
vised by Dr. Leonard Bloomfield,
Sterling Professor of Linguistics
at Yale at the time of his death in
1949. He passed it on to dictionary
editor Clarence L. Barnhart for
use with his own child.
BARNHART, listed as co-author
of the published version “Let’s
Read,” (Wayne University Press)
tells in a foreword of their long,
unsuccessful attempt to find a uni
versity school of education or a
publisher willing to give the meth
od a trial under controlled condi
tions. Its only major use hd* been
in parochial schools in Chicago.
Bloomfield’s system is called a
linguistic approach, and Barnhart
defines that as essentially the sep
aration of "the problem of word
form from the study of word
meaning.” A child beginning
school is presumed to know the
meaning of anywhere from 5,000
to 25,000 words, and if he doesn’t,
teaching him to read them won’t
solve the problem, the authors say.
The system uses phonetics but
does not teach them to the child.
And Bloomfield, in an introduc
tory essay, says he is not much
concerned with the content of the
earliest reading.

“ASIDE from their silliness, the
stories in a child’s first reader are
of little use, because the child is
too busy with the mechanics of
reading to get anything of the con
tent,” he writes.

By the time a child is through
the 275 lessons of this volume,
which also contains instructions
for the teacher, he has a reading
vocabulary of 5,000 words
slightly more than the number in
an average sixth grade reader—
and is presumed able to read any
thing he wants. Furthermore, the
authors note, he’s presumed to be
able to spell all the words he
knows.
