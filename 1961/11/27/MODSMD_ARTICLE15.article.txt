## Charges of Neo-Nazism Termed 'Unreasonable' 
### JIM WOOLSEY 
Two charges seem pertinent
against Mr. Shirer’s and his
friends’ witch hunt for neo-Nazism
in Germany: it is unreasonable
and it is dangerous.
The line of reasoning used by
these gentlemen and the billboards
in East Berlin subways runs some
thing like this: Some West Ger
man government officials were
once Nazis. Nazis were fascists.
The West German government is
now fascist.

It is interesting to note that
many who are quite tolerant of
Communist party membership in
the thirties grow livid when faced
with a German whose patriotism
was perverted in those same trou
bled years. Is Germany now or
eternally fascist? Let’s look at
the current situation.
TIES WITH the liberal tradition
of the West are stronger than
ever. The Common Market, Eur
atom, the Coal and Steel Com
munity and NATO bind Germany
to the West strongly for the first

time. Vigorous prosperity under a
democratic system is a new and
enlightening experience for the
German people.
Is government policy under the
thumb of the depraved German
businessmen? Mitbesti mmu n g
(co-determination) now allows la
bor one-third of the controlling
seats on the boards of manage
ment in the heavy industries.
Do West German youth appear
indoctrinated by the barracks?
Not to those who have seen them
march in the streets and mock the
military.
IS ANTI-SEMITISM still evi
dent? It is rather frowned upon by
law and society. A Jew finds no re
strictions in Germany when he
wishes to enter a fraternity for ex
ample, a rather different situa
tion than the one existing here.
It would seem to be fairer to
look to the whole nation and the
post-war temperament of its peo
ple, rather than to the past politi
cal allegiances and indeterminable
past loyalties of a few of its offi
cials.

There are more serious flaws
than mere overgeneralizations in
the arguments of Mr. Shirer’s sup
porters. The gentlemen quote Heu
singer: “We must remember our
past, and we should not neglect
the decisive factors of leadership
which bring success. Let us stick
to the principles we used to have.”
“THIS,” they cry in mock as
tonishment, "from the present
commander-in-chief of the Ger
man Army.” Leadership (re-read
the quote) has been a desirable in
gredient in any army for some
time, even those who fight for
democracy, as any American offi
cer from Bunker Hiil to Remagen
would assure Heusinger’s critics.
The attempt to twist such a state
ment to try to show that fascism
is again on the rise in Germany
evidences both a deplorable lack
of proof and a blatant disregard
of journalistic ethics.
After having reeducated the
"naturally militaristic” Germans
in 1945, we reversed our field a
few years later and began to re
build their armies with American
money and weapons. I find it hard
to be astonished that some Ger
mans are a bit in the dark con
cerning the proper attitude to
ward guns and such

SHIRER’S supporters conclude
with a shrewd political analysis
by psychologist Fromm which
suggests that Germany is going to
again dominate Europe unless we
abandon her and choose England
as an ally. Unfortunately England
has introduced a measure of per
plexity into the matter by recently
deciding to join Germany and five
other European countries in the
Common Market, and by opening
her soil to troop maneuvers by her
“fascist” NATO ally.

Should wo solemnly pledge sup
port of England and denounce
Germany, we are likely to be met
by only quizzical looks from the
other side of the Atlantic.

Mr. Harrison et al point out that
“Five years from now it may be
too late.” Indeed it may be, if we
do our best to foment distrust and
tension in the Atlantic Communi
ty, the only area of the world
which still gives strong and capa
ble support to the liberal values
of the West.

“Five years from now it may be
too late.” Indeed it may be, if we
do our best to foment distrust and
tension in the Atlantic Communi
ty, the only area of the world
which still gives strong and capa
ble support to the liberal values
of the West.
Two charges seem pertinent
against Mr. Shirer’s and his
friends’ witch hunt for neo-Nazism
in Germany: it is unreasonable
and it is dangerous.
The line of reasoning used by
these gentlemen and the billboards
in East Berlin subways runs some
thing like this: Some West Ger
man government officials were
once Nazis. Nazis were fascists.
The West German government is
now fascist.

It is interesting to note that
many who are quite tolerant of
Communist party membership in
the thirties grow livid when faced
with a German whose patriotism
was perverted in those same trou
bled years. Is Germany now or
eternally fascist? Let’s look at
the current situation.
TIES WITH the liberal tradition
of the West are stronger than
ever. The Common Market, Eur
atom, the Coal and Steel Com
munity and NATO bind Germany
to the West strongly for the first

time. Vigorous prosperity under a
democratic system is a new and
enlightening experience for the
German people.
Is government policy under the
thumb of the depraved German
businessmen? Mitbesti mmu n g
(co-determination) now allows la
bor one-third of the controlling
seats on the boards of manage
ment in the heavy industries.
Do West German youth appear
indoctrinated by the barracks?
Not to those who have seen them
march in the streets and mock the
military.
IS ANTI-SEMITISM still evi
dent? It is rather frowned upon by
law and society. A Jew finds no re
strictions in Germany when he
wishes to enter a fraternity for ex
ample, a rather different situa
tion than the one existing here.
It would seem to be fairer to
look to the whole nation and the
post-war temperament of its peo
ple, rather than to the past politi
cal allegiances and indeterminable
past loyalties of a few of its offi
cials.

There are more serious flaws
than mere overgeneralizations in
the arguments of Mr. Shirer’s sup
porters. The gentlemen quote Heu
singer: “We must remember our
past, and we should not neglect
the decisive factors of leadership
which bring success. Let us stick
to the principles we used to have.”
“THIS,” they cry in mock as
tonishment, "from the present
commander-in-chief of the Ger
man Army.” Leadership (re-read
the quote) has been a desirable in
gredient in any army for some
time, even those who fight for
democracy, as any American offi
cer from Bunker Hiil to Remagen
would assure Heusinger’s critics.
The attempt to twist such a state
ment to try to show that fascism
is again on the rise in Germany
evidences both a deplorable lack
of proof and a blatant disregard
of journalistic ethics.
After having reeducated the
"naturally militaristic” Germans
in 1945, we reversed our field a
few years later and began to re
build their armies with American
money and weapons. I find it hard
to be astonished that some Ger
mans are a bit in the dark con
cerning the proper attitude to
ward guns and such

SHIRER’S supporters conclude
with a shrewd political analysis
by psychologist Fromm which
suggests that Germany is going to
again dominate Europe unless we
abandon her and choose England
as an ally. Unfortunately England
has introduced a measure of per
plexity into the matter by recently
deciding to join Germany and five
other European countries in the
Common Market, and by opening
her soil to troop maneuvers by her
“fascist” NATO ally.

Should wo solemnly pledge sup
port of England and denounce
Germany, we are likely to be met
by only quizzical looks from the
other side of the Atlantic.

which still gives strong and capa
ble support to the liberal values
of the West.
