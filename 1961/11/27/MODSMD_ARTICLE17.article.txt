AMERICANS ABROAD
Editor, The Daily:
Americans in Ethiopia do of
course sometimes merit the dis
couraging picture painted of them
by Mr. French in his article lam
basting foreign aid.
The following letter however, is
from an Ethiopian boy and tends
to show a side of Americans
abroad easily overlooked by those
who are disposed to making harsh
generalizations.
This letter is written in the Ethi
opian’s own newly-learned English
and describes his chance meeting
with a particular American engi
neer who works with the ICA in
Addis Ababa. I have exerpted
parts, and changed the name of
the engineer:
“You see I was an ignorant vil
lager. I came to the capitol from a
district called Nadier which is a
thousand kinometers north. In the
capital I had neither brothers nor
any relatives of my flesh. So I be
come to be a street hoy so to say a
vagabound.
"But one day I was fortunate to
meet father Donald ... He send mo
to school, supplying with every
necessary thing for my education.
He pays a lot of money for my
food, cloth, shoes, monthley, and

he pays a lot of money during the
Ethiopian school vacation for he
use to send me to places where I
can enjoy myself.”
Finally, this boy signed his
name, proudly adopting as his own
last name that of his new friend
and benefactor.
Let’s not sell our people short.
Even in the wild highlands of
Ethiopia we are creating some
loyalties which will long outlive
our departure.
