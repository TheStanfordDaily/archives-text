# Peace Corps To Test Today
## 
### 
Entrance tests for the United
States Peace Corps will be given
today and tomorrow at 8:30 a.m.
in Room 47 of the menâ€™s physical
education building. Students can
take the six-hour tests either day.
A number of extra tests will be
on hand, so it will be possible for
students who have not yet filled
ou the application blanks to take
the examinations. Students who
will not be available for service in
the Peace Corps within the next
12 months are advised not to take
the test. Taking of the test in
volves no commitment.
Students who will receive their
degrees this June will probably be
notified sometime around April
whether they have been accepted
and where they will be sent. Most
of the volunteers will be placed
into training after graduation in
June or July.

Fact books on the Peace Corps
are available at the HR. Persons
with further questions about the
Peace Corps can phone Peter
Grothe at WH 8-9295 or Lucy
Ames at DA 6-152 !
