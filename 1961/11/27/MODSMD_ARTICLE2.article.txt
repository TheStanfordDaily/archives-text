# New Rush System Presented to IFC
## 
### GREGG HOPKINS Contributing Editor 
A change in the present fraternity rush system to permit “relaxed
contact” between fraternity men and freshmen during the coining
winter quarter will be voted on tonight by the Inter-Fraternity
Council. The proposal was framed l>y the Interfraternity Board,

and presented to the IFC lastf
Mon d ay by Profs. Philip H.
Rhinelander and Robert A. Horn,
faculty members of the IFB.
The proposal provides for “re
laxed contact” between freshmen
and fraternity members begin
ning winter quarter, and prohib
its off-campus contact and fra
ternity men from entering Wil
bur Hall except at specified times.
THE PRESENT system of for
mal rush during the first week
of spring quarter will be retained
if the proposal is passed, but the
number of open house and par
ties will be reduced.
The new proposal came, accord
ing to Pierson, as a result of
IFC’s expression of dissatisfac
tion three weeks ago with the
present rush system and the pre
sophomore year rush period pro
posed by the Wilbur sponsors and
an alternate plan of the IFC rush
ing committee to move spring
quarter rush forward into the
betweon-quarter break.
WHEN NONE of these was
judged satisfactory by the IFC,
Pierson said, the IFB began to
consider alternate plans. The Wil
bur Sponsors’ plan was unani
mously voted down by the IFB,
which then went on to seek a
bettor solution to the rushing
problem, Pierson said. The IFC
ex-com originally drafted the
present proposal, and it was then
reviewed, amended and approved
by the IFB.
Objections to the now proposal
were voiced by Bill Broil, Theta
Delta Chi IFC representative:
“The proposal would deprive
freshmen of one necessary quar-
I ter to become oriented in the
University and to know a maxi
mum number of their classmates
in a relaxed basis.” Broil also felt
“it would financially ruin us,” as
on-campus contact led to more
elaborate functions and “probably
to off-campus parties too.”
“THE PLAN is good in theory,”
said A1 Do Fraga, Delta Chi rep
resentative, “but it needs restric
tion to be practical. We’re afraid
it will mushroom.” Prager in
tends to submit amendments to
the proposal before it is voted on
tonight.
These, Prager said, will "en
courage favorable contact and
prevent the new plan from get
ting out of hand and developing
into quarter-long rushing.” Pra
ger said he would vote against
the plan unless it carries restrict
ing amendments.
PIERSON commented that the
reduction in spring quarter par
ties—from a possible seven off
i campus parties to a maximum of
I four, will reduce the spring rush
expenses enough to offset any ex
| penses that he foresees houses in
curring in any winter quarter
rush program.
Facets of “relaxed contact” are
{ to show freshmen “how we live
| in fraternities,” Pierson said. It
would include inviting frosh to
: meals and to houses to study.
Pierson said he expected re
[ strictions to bo amended to the
j IFB proposal, although he did not
■ personally favor any move that
I would detract from the IFB’s
j goal of open contact.
THIS goal would enable fresh
j men and fraternity men to meet
and know each other in a relaxed,
natural manner. The new proposal,
ho said, “is not designed to open
rushing into a quarter-long period,
but to encourage communication,
decision and association on the
basis of real friendship through
acquaintance between fraternities
and rushecs.”
