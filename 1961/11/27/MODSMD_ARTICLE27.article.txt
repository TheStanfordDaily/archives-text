# Card Harriers Vandalized
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Idaho's speedy Vandals ran off
with the third annual West Coast
Cross Country Championships,
contested on the Stanford golf
course Saturday, by placing their
three top men ono-two-three.
Stanford’s runners closed the
fall season on an improved note,
tying Cal for third place in the 11-
team field. Behind Idaho’s 27
points, the battle for second place
was unusually close, with San
Jose at 48, Cal and Stanford scor
ing 50 each, and Occidental only
one behind at 51. San Francisco
State, Sacramento State, Long
Beach State, Los Angeles State,
Pomona and Whittier finished in
that order.
PAUL HKNDFN, an English
man transplanted in British Co
lumbia who is now an Idaho fresh
man, ran the 4.2-mile course in

20:27.0, the second fastest time of
the year and also the second fast
est ever by a frosh, to win. Despite
the cold and damp weather, this
was only two-tenths of a second
slower than the year’s best, by"
Danny Murphy of San Jose, who
was fourth Saturday. Dick Doug
las, Idaho sophomore who is also
from England byway of Canada
was second in 20:42.8, while Louis
Olaso of the Vandals finished
strong in 20:52.8 for third.
Weym Kirkland was Stanford’s
first finisher, in seventh place in
21:04, the second fastest time of
the season by any Stanford har
rier. Paul Schlicke was tenth in
21:21, Bill Pratt and Harlan An
drews were 16-17 in 21:41 and 21:45
respectively, while John Beck,
twenty-eighth in 22:12, and Rich
K 1 i e r, thirty-second in 22:20,
rounded out the Card squad. Only

the top four counted in the scor
ing.

BUT FOR some last minute
heroics, the Cards might have been
fifth instead of third. A great
stretch run by Schlicke enabled
him to edge out Gordon White
head of Cal for tenth place by not
more than one or two inches. At
the same time, San Jose’s Murphy
was just able to hold off Occiden
tal’s Leroy Neal for fourth place.
The r ace was so close than an ex
change of just one or two points in
either of these cases would have
made all the difference.
The victory for Idaho was their
second in this race in the last three
years. After winning the inaugural
in 1959, the Vandals were upset by
an inspired pack of Indians last
year, but bounced back on Satur
day. Since the Idaho top four in
cluded two freshmen and two-soph
omores, they should be at least as
strong for a long time to come.

THE CARD harriers should get
even better also. Four of the Stan
ford top five are freshmen, the
other being a sophomore. Another
of the top Indian frosh, Dave Stine
back, didn’t run in the W4C.

San Jose, always a track power,
is really a great deal stronger than
the score indicates. Six of the top
eight Spartan harriers were in the
East competing in the NCAA
meet, and freshmen Murphy and
Tom Tuite, who were saving eli
gibility, were the only top mem
bers of the team on hand. If Char
ley Clark and Jeff Fishback had
been running for the Spartans it
might have been a much different
race.

COACH PAYTON Jordan com
menting on the close of the sea
son, pointed out that a tie with Cal
is about is good away as possible
to finish, because nobody has to
lose. It was the sixth meeting be
tween the two squads this fall,
with the Cards winning three and
the Bears two, along with the
standoff.

Jordan called the race “wonder
ful,” especially from a spectator
viewpoint, and the “closest con
tested we’ve ever had.” He ex
pressed optimism for the 1962 sea
son, especially in the light of the
outstanding group of frosh re
turnees.

second in this race in the last three
years. After winning the inaugural
in 1959, the Vandals were upset by
an inspired pack of Indians last
year, but bounced back on Satur
day. Since the Idaho top four in
cluded two freshmen and two-soph
omores, they should be at least as
strong for a long time to come.

THE CARD harriers should get
even better also. Four of the Stan
ford top five are freshmen, the
other being a sophomore. Another
of the top Indian frosh, Dave Stine
back, didn’t run in the W4C.

San Jose, always a track power,
is really a great deal stronger than
the score indicates. Six of the top
eight Spartan harriers were in the
East competing in the NCAA
meet, and freshmen Murphy and
Tom Tuite, who were saving eli
gibility, were the only top mem
bers of the team on hand. If Char
ley Clark and Jeff Fishback had
been running for the Spartans it
might have been a much different
race.

COACH PAYTON Jordan com
menting on the close of the sea
son, pointed out that a tie with Cal
is about is good away as possible
to finish, because nobody has to
lose. It was the sixth meeting be
tween the two squads this fall,
with the Cards winning three and
the Bears two, along with the
standoff.

Jordan called the race “wonder
ful,” especially from a spectator
viewpoint, and the “closest con
tested we’ve ever had.” He ex
pressed optimism for the 1962 sea
son, especially in the light of the
outstanding group of frosh re
turnees.
Idaho's speedy Vandals ran off
with the third annual West Coast
Cross Country Championships,
contested on the Stanford golf
course Saturday, by placing their
three top men ono-two-three.
Stanford’s runners closed the
fall season on an improved note,
tying Cal for third place in the 11-
team field. Behind Idaho’s 27
points, the battle for second place
was unusually close, with San
Jose at 48, Cal and Stanford scor
ing 50 each, and Occidental only
one behind at 51. San Francisco
State, Sacramento State, Long
Beach State, Los Angeles State,
Pomona and Whittier finished in
that order.
PAUL HKNDFN, an English
man transplanted in British Co
lumbia who is now an Idaho fresh
man, ran the 4.2-mile course in

20:27.0, the second fastest time of
the year and also the second fast
est ever by a frosh, to win. Despite
the cold and damp weather, this
was only two-tenths of a second
slower than the year’s best, by"
Danny Murphy of San Jose, who
was fourth Saturday. Dick Doug
las, Idaho sophomore who is also
from England byway of Canada
was second in 20:42.8, while Louis
Olaso of the Vandals finished
strong in 20:52.8 for third.
Weym Kirkland was Stanford’s
first finisher, in seventh place in
21:04, the second fastest time of
the season by any Stanford har
rier. Paul Schlicke was tenth in
21:21, Bill Pratt and Harlan An
drews were 16-17 in 21:41 and 21:45
respectively, while John Beck,
twenty-eighth in 22:12, and Rich
K 1 i e r, thirty-second in 22:20,
rounded out the Card squad. Only

the top four counted in the scor
ing.

BUT FOR some last minute
heroics, the Cards might have been
fifth instead of third. A great
stretch run by Schlicke enabled
him to edge out Gordon White
head of Cal for tenth place by not
more than one or two inches. At
the same time, San Jose’s Murphy
was just able to hold off Occiden
tal’s Leroy Neal for fourth place.
The r ace was so close than an ex
change of just one or two points in
either of these cases would have
made all the difference.

est ever by a frosh, to win. Despite
the cold and damp weather, this
was only two-tenths of a second
slower than the year’s best, by"
Danny Murphy of San Jose, who
was fourth Saturday. Dick Doug
las, Idaho sophomore who is also
from England byway of Canada
was second in 20:42.8, while Louis
Olaso of the Vandals finished
strong in 20:52.8 for third.
Weym Kirkland was Stanford’s
first finisher, in seventh place in
21:04, the second fastest time of
the season by any Stanford har
rier. Paul Schlicke was tenth in
21:21, Bill Pratt and Harlan An
drews were 16-17 in 21:41 and 21:45
respectively, while John Beck,
twenty-eighth in 22:12, and Rich
K 1 i e r, thirty-second in 22:20,
rounded out the Card squad. Only

the top four counted in the scor
ing.

BUT FOR some last minute
heroics, the Cards might have been
fifth instead of third. A great
stretch run by Schlicke enabled
him to edge out Gordon White
head of Cal for tenth place by not
more than one or two inches. At
the same time, San Jose’s Murphy
was just able to hold off Occiden
tal’s Leroy Neal for fourth place.
The r ace was so close than an ex
change of just one or two points in
either of these cases would have
made all the difference.
The victory for Idaho was their
second in this race in the last three
years. After winning the inaugural
in 1959, the Vandals were upset by
an inspired pack of Indians last
year, but bounced back on Satur
day. Since the Idaho top four in
cluded two freshmen and two-soph
omores, they should be at least as
strong for a long time to come.

THE CARD harriers should get
even better also. Four of the Stan
ford top five are freshmen, the
other being a sophomore. Another
of the top Indian frosh, Dave Stine
back, didn’t run in the W4C.

San Jose, always a track power,
is really a great deal stronger than
the score indicates. Six of the top
eight Spartan harriers were in the
East competing in the NCAA
meet, and freshmen Murphy and
Tom Tuite, who were saving eli
gibility, were the only top mem
bers of the team on hand. If Char
ley Clark and Jeff Fishback had
been running for the Spartans it
might have been a much different
race.

COACH PAYTON Jordan com
menting on the close of the sea
son, pointed out that a tie with Cal
is about is good away as possible
to finish, because nobody has to
lose. It was the sixth meeting be
tween the two squads this fall,
with the Cards winning three and
the Bears two, along with the
standoff.

Jordan called the race “wonder
ful,” especially from a spectator
viewpoint, and the “closest con
tested we’ve ever had.” He ex
pressed optimism for the 1962 sea
son, especially in the light of the
outstanding group of frosh re
turnees.
