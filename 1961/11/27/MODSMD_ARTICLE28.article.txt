# Orange and Cotton Set; Sugar and Rose Wait

It’ll be Louisiana State against
Colorado in the Orange Bowl and
Texas against some southern pow
er in the Cotton Bowl, but the line
up in the Rose and Sugar Bowls
hung yesterday on tlie* question of
whether Alabama, the nation’s No.
1 team, is headed for Pasadena or
New Orleans.
Alabama would be a shoo-in to
face Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl
except for the fact that the Ohio
State faculty may vote against the
Buckeyes going to the Rose Bowl
despite their undisputed Big Ten
title. In that case, it is likely that
it will be Alabama vs. UcLa in
the “daddy” of the bowl games.
Thus, the Sugar and Cotton
Bowl committees must wait in the
Alabama-Ohio State situation be
fore lining up opponents for Ar
kansas and Texas, respectively.
Mississippi is the most likely se
lection for the Sugar Bowl if Ala
bama goes West and figures to
nail down the Cotton Bowl invita
tion if the nation’s No. 1 team goes
to the Sugar Bowl.

Both Alabama and Mississippi
have a game left next Saturday
so the final decisions could hang
for several days.
Louisiana State and Colorado
completed the only major bowl
pairings decided Saturday with
smashing victories the Tigers
crushing Tulane, 62-0, and the Buf
faloes routing lowa State, 34-0.
LSU was ranked fourth nationally
and Colorado eighth in last week’s
ratings by the United Press Inter
national Board of Coaches.
UCLA clinched the host bid to
the Rose Bowl with a 10-7 triumph
over Southern California and Ar
kansas and Texas have won their
bids to the Sugar and Cotton
Bowls, respectively.
Outside the so-called “Big
Four,” Syracuse has accepted a
Liberty Bowl bid with Utah State
a possible opponent: Gotham Bowl
bids are out to Kansas and Penn
State, with a decision possible on
Monday, and Georgia Tech is in
the Gator Bowl. Maryland would

have accepted a bid opposite Geor
gia Tech but bowed to Virginia,
28-16, on Saturday.
Ohio State, the nation’s second
ranked team, clinched the Big Ten
title when it whipped ninth-ranked
Michigan, 50-20, and Wisconsin up
set third-ranked Minnesota, 23-21.
Bob Ferguson scored four touch
downs for Ohio State as it com
pleted a nine-game schedule
marred only by an opening tie with
Texas Christian.
Arkansas, ranked No. 10, won
the Sugar Bowl bid and tied Texas
for the Southwest Conference
championship by downing Texas
Tech, 28-0. Texas plays in the Cot
ton Bowl on the basis of its regu
lar-season victory over Arkansas.
Halfback Wendell Harris scored
three touchdowns and tallied 26
points for Louisiana State; Bill
Harris ran for three touchdowns,
including gallops of 86 and 59
yards, for Colorado, and Jim Bak
ken’s 31 -yard field goal in the final
minutes of the game enabled Wis
consin to upset Minnesota.
