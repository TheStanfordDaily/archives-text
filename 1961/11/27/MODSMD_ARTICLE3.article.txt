HYANNIS PORT. Mass. (UPI)
President Kennedy yesterday an
nounced a major job shakeup in
the White House and State De
partment, including reassignment
of Undersecretary of State Ches
ter Bowles, the department’s con
troversial No. 2 man.

Bowles, one of the key men in
Kennedy’s drive to obtain the 1960
presidential nomination, is being
shifted to "a new high policy po
sition.” Details of the new job
were to be announced shortly.
IN KENNEDY’S first big turn
over of key administration per
sonnel, W. Averell Harriman, now
Kennedy’s ambassador at large,
will become assistant secretary
of state for Far Eastern affairs.

Bowles, who reportedly had dif
fered with Kennedy on Cuba and
other issues, will be succeeded as
undersecretary by George Ball,
now undersecretary of state for
economic affairs.

Bowles’ resignation or transfer
had been reported and denied
some months ago. He was among
10 White House and Stale Depart
ment officials involved in Sun
days’ far-reaching turnover’.
THE KENNEDY announcement
was made by Press Secretary
Pierre Salinger at the weekend
White House. He refused to an
swer any questions from news
men about what Bowl e s’ job
would entail or the reasons be
hind the switches.
The announcement said details
of Bowles’ new position "will be
announced shortly.” It said the
changes were made "in order to
provide a more effective match
ing of people with responsibili
ties.”

Ball, Bowles’ successor, will be
succeeded in turn by George Mc-
Ghee, currently counselor of the
State Department and chairman
of the department’s Policy Plan
ning Council.
OTHER TRANSFERS includ
ed: Wall W. Rostow, now deputy
special assistant to the President
for national security affairs, to
follow McGhee as State Depart
ment counselor and chairman of
the Policy Planning Council.
-—Richard N. Goodwin, deputy
special counsel to the President,
to become deputy assistant secre
tary of state for inter-American
affairs, a new position.
REPORTS that Bowles was on
his way out of his State Depart
ment post —second highest there
—arose after the Cuban invasion
debacle earliex this year. He was
accused of letting it be known be
hind the scenes that he had op
posed the ill-fated venture.
There also were difficulties
arising from a White House feel
ing that Bowles was ignoring his
assigned functions as administra
tive head of the State Department
to dabble in policy-making.
There were reports at one point
that Bowles actually was resign
ing and would visit Kennedy at
the White House to firm up this
move. But instead, after White
House denials that a meeting was
planned, Bowles saw Kennedy and
won several public endorsements
from him.
HOWEVER, Bowles was sched
uled to make an overseas tour at
that time in which his prestige
would have been damaged by any
reports of his removal.
Since then, an undercurrent of
controversy surrounding the role
of Bowles has continued within
the administration.
