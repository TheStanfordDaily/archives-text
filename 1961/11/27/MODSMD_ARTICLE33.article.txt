## 'EVERYONE PLAYED IN BIG GAME' Smith, Craig, Babajian Singled by Coach Jack 
### ROY SCHMIDT 
Well, he finally did it. Stanford
Coach Jack Curtice is now proud
possessor of his first victory over
the Golden Bears of California in
four tries.
“These kids have given more all
out effort than any outfit I’ve
coached,” he said. “Every one of
these 44 boys, crippled and all, got
a chance to play in the Big Game.”
Among the disabled Rod Sears
played a series of downs at quar
terback in spile of a strong case of
flu, Steve Pursell hobbled in at
end with both ankles heavily
taped, and Chuck Butler ran a play
at quarterback with a bad knee.
“I TOLD CHUCK to just take
the ball from the center and lay
down,” Curtice quipped.
Curtice lauded the play of half
back Gary Craig, who scored two
touchdowns, tine on a 24-yard
dash; intercepted a pass; and was
the Cards’ leading rusher with 39
yards and a 6.5 average.
“That TD run by Craig had some
of the finest blocking I’ve seen all
year, the Stanford headman said.
“They got the end, the linebacker
and the safety one after the other,
and Craig made quite a run.”
HE ALSO singled out fullback
Ken Babajian who blasted over for
one touchdown and averaged close
to three yards to try through the
Cal line.
Heavy rains forced the Indians
to stay on the ground, and they
showed surprising strength up the
middle. Fullbacks Babajian and
Hal Steuber Were continually rip
ping off yardage in big chunks.
Several Stanford interior linemen
expressed surprise at how easy it
was to move the Cal line.
QUARTERBACK JIM Smith
drew praise from Curtice after go
ing almost the entire game on his
own. With Sears coming down
with the flu Friday, Butler on the
sidelines with a bad leg, and Steve
Thurlow still nursing an attack of
mononucleosis, the job w'as loft
squarely to Smith.
“That Smitty, you know he
hasn’t played much quarterback
for us (his season,” Curtice said.
“And then be comes through with

a job like he did today.” Smith led
the Indians in total offense and
completed 5 of 7 passes.
CURTICE ALSO singled out
linebackers John Butler and Ed
Cummings for their fine defensive
effort and Steuber for his block
ing.

The Indians came up with a new
center-eligible formation which
they used twice in the final quar
ter. “I told them not to use it but
once,” Curtice said, ‘‘but those kids
like it so well that they called it
that second time. Ol’ Chris (center
Chris Cottle) wanted to catch that
ball so bad. and he was open both
times.”

THE UNUSUAL formation has
all the linemen split to the left and
all the backs to the right. The quar
terback stands deep and must get
off his pass without the aid of
blocking. “We had about a half
dozen plays that we could have run
from it,” Curtice said.

The colorful Card mentor put
an end to speculation that he might
leave Stanford for another posi
tion. “I’m not a tramp coach, I
came here to do a job. I hope to
fulfill my contract, and I hope they
(the University) will fulfill theirs.
He said they have been building
and that next year’s team looks
like the best crop yet. “Remem
ber, we carried 34 sophomores
this year,” Curtice pointed out.

“With a bunch of kids like I’ve
got, I keep thinking we’re gonna
do it.”

times.”

THE UNUSUAL formation has
all the linemen split to the left and
all the backs to the right. The quar
terback stands deep and must get
off his pass without the aid of
blocking. “We had about a half
dozen plays that we could have run
from it,” Curtice said.

The colorful Card mentor put
an end to speculation that he might
leave Stanford for another posi
tion. “I’m not a tramp coach, I
came here to do a job. I hope to
fulfill my contract, and I hope they
(the University) will fulfill theirs.
He said they have been building
and that next year’s team looks
like the best crop yet. “Remem
ber, we carried 34 sophomores
this year,” Curtice pointed out.

“With a bunch of kids like I’ve
got, I keep thinking we’re gonna
do it.”
Well, he finally did it. Stanford
Coach Jack Curtice is now proud
possessor of his first victory over
the Golden Bears of California in
four tries.
“These kids have given more all
out effort than any outfit I’ve
coached,” he said. “Every one of
these 44 boys, crippled and all, got
a chance to play in the Big Game.”
Among the disabled Rod Sears
played a series of downs at quar
terback in spile of a strong case of
flu, Steve Pursell hobbled in at
end with both ankles heavily
taped, and Chuck Butler ran a play
at quarterback with a bad knee.
“I TOLD CHUCK to just take
the ball from the center and lay
down,” Curtice quipped.
Curtice lauded the play of half
back Gary Craig, who scored two
touchdowns, tine on a 24-yard
dash; intercepted a pass; and was
the Cards’ leading rusher with 39
yards and a 6.5 average.
“That TD run by Craig had some
of the finest blocking I’ve seen all
year, the Stanford headman said.
“They got the end, the linebacker
and the safety one after the other,
and Craig made quite a run.”
HE ALSO singled out fullback
Ken Babajian who blasted over for
one touchdown and averaged close
to three yards to try through the
Cal line.
Heavy rains forced the Indians
to stay on the ground, and they
showed surprising strength up the
middle. Fullbacks Babajian and
Hal Steuber Were continually rip
ping off yardage in big chunks.
Several Stanford interior linemen
expressed surprise at how easy it
was to move the Cal line.
QUARTERBACK JIM Smith
drew praise from Curtice after go
ing almost the entire game on his
own. With Sears coming down
with the flu Friday, Butler on the
sidelines with a bad leg, and Steve
Thurlow still nursing an attack of
mononucleosis, the job w'as loft
squarely to Smith.
“That Smitty, you know he
hasn’t played much quarterback
for us (his season,” Curtice said.
“And then be comes through with

a job like he did today.” Smith led
the Indians in total offense and
completed 5 of 7 passes.
CURTICE ALSO singled out
linebackers John Butler and Ed
Cummings for their fine defensive
effort and Steuber for his block
ing.

The Indians came up with a new
center-eligible formation which
they used twice in the final quar
ter. “I told them not to use it but
once,” Curtice said, ‘‘but those kids
like it so well that they called it
that second time. Ol’ Chris (center
Chris Cottle) wanted to catch that
ball so bad. and he was open both
times.”
