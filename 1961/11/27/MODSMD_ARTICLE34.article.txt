brand later nailed Gold for a ten
yard loss, and forced the Cal quar
terback to hurry his toss to Dave
Muga and Craig intercepted, re
turning 21 yards to the Bear 18.
This set (he stage for the whack
iest formation of the year, in a
season that saw plenty of crazy
ones. The Stanford linemen all
lined up five yards to the left of
center Chris Cottle. Thus Cottle
was the light end. Smith was the
tailback, ten yards behind Cottle,
and the backs were split to the
right sideline and lined up a yard
behind the line of scrimmage.
On the first play from this for
mation, Smith completed a short
pass to Craig past the 15. The next
play was from the same formation,
a pass to Cottle in the end zone.
Cottle couldn’t spot the hall and
Cal end Bill Turner picked off the
pass two yards deep in the end
zone, running it out to the nine.
That ended that nonsense.
STANFORD TRIED other such
tricks. One play saw Lindskog roll
out to the right with a pitchout
and throw a long wobbly pass that
Burke tried so hard to get ho was
called for interfering with the Cal
safety man.
Coach Jack Curtice got every
man of the 44 who suited up into
the game. Even Chuck Butler, who
was taped up like a mummy got in
and quarterbacked, sneaking on
the last two plays of the game.
Stanford’s outstanding were le
gion. Of the backs, Craig and
Smith must be singled out, hut
Babajian, Steuber and Lindskog
can’t be overlooked for their work
on offense. Sargent. Jim Shroyer
and Tim Hansel were the top de
fensive backs.
JOHN BUTLER and Ed Cum
mings showed why they were
Stanford’s nominations for Nor-
Cal’s lineman and back of the year
with their hard tackling.
Patitucci was the outstanding
lineman, blocking, batting down
passes, recovering fumbles, re
ceiving and ruining the Cal end
run. George Honore did much the
same.
Among the interior linemen,
Buehler. Frank Atkinson, Hilde
brand. Tom Walsh, Errol Scott and
Cottle all blocked as a team at
their finest form this season.
The juniors and sophomores
showed so much desire and eager
ness for contact that the “Big
Game” of 1961 may have been the
preview of 1962.

CUMMINGS BLASTS THROUGH -Stanford fullback Ed Cummings spurts through the California line

a key tackle of Cal's George Pierovich on the goal line that forced him to fumble. Gary Sargent re
covered for Stanford in the end zone for a touchback. It was the Indians' first Big Game victory in

on his way to a long gain in Saturday's Big Game. Cummings led a determined Card defense that
held Cal scoreless in the first half and yielded only one touchdown overall. The big linebacker made
a key tackle of Cal's George Pierovich on the goal line that forced him to fumble. Gary Sargent re
covered for Stanford in the end zone for a touchback. It was the Indians' first Big Game victory in
five years.

HALFBACK STAN LINDSKOG eludes a couple of California tacklers
and breaks away for a 49-yard gallop in the third quarter. On the
next play he ripped off 21 more to set up the final Stanford score.
brand later nailed Gold for a ten
yard loss, and forced the Cal quar
terback to hurry his toss to Dave
Muga and Craig intercepted, re
turning 21 yards to the Bear 18.
This set (he stage for the whack
iest formation of the year, in a
season that saw plenty of crazy
ones. The Stanford linemen all
lined up five yards to the left of
center Chris Cottle. Thus Cottle
was the light end. Smith was the
tailback, ten yards behind Cottle,
and the backs were split to the
right sideline and lined up a yard
behind the line of scrimmage.
On the first play from this for
mation, Smith completed a short
pass to Craig past the 15. The next
play was from the same formation,
a pass to Cottle in the end zone.
Cottle couldn’t spot the hall and
Cal end Bill Turner picked off the
pass two yards deep in the end
zone, running it out to the nine.
That ended that nonsense.
STANFORD TRIED other such
tricks. One play saw Lindskog roll
out to the right with a pitchout
and throw a long wobbly pass that
Burke tried so hard to get ho was
called for interfering with the Cal
safety man.
Coach Jack Curtice got every
man of the 44 who suited up into
the game. Even Chuck Butler, who
was taped up like a mummy got in
and quarterbacked, sneaking on
the last two plays of the game.
Stanford’s outstanding were le
gion. Of the backs, Craig and
Smith must be singled out, hut
Babajian, Steuber and Lindskog
can’t be overlooked for their work
on offense. Sargent. Jim Shroyer
and Tim Hansel were the top de
fensive backs.
JOHN BUTLER and Ed Cum
mings showed why they were
Stanford’s nominations for Nor-
Cal’s lineman and back of the year
with their hard tackling.
Patitucci was the outstanding
lineman, blocking, batting down
passes, recovering fumbles, re
ceiving and ruining the Cal end
run. George Honore did much the
same.
Among the interior linemen,
Buehler. Frank Atkinson, Hilde
brand. Tom Walsh, Errol Scott and
Cottle all blocked as a team at
their finest form this season.
The juniors and sophomores
showed so much desire and eager
ness for contact that the “Big
Game” of 1961 may have been the
preview of 1962.
