# Brodie Sparks 49'er Victory

SAN FRANCISCO (UPI)
Quarterback John Brodie threw
one touchdown pass, scored once
himself and set up three other
counters with his brilliant aerials
yesterday as the San Francisco
Forty-Niners whipped Minnesota,
38-28, in a National Football
League game.
Given a mighty assist by half
back J. D. Smith, who powered
through the porous Viking line
for big chunks of yardage, the
ex-Stanford star had one of his
greater days. The Forty-Niners
stuck to the T formation and
didn’t use a single shotgun play
all day.
The Forty-Niners piled up a
21-0 margin in the first 19 min
utes of play and then fought off
a determined second half rally
spearheaded by halfback Tommy
Mason and former Forty-Niner
Hugh McElhenny.
Brodie’s heroics started on the
first march when he completed
passes of 19 and 12 yards to end
Monte Stickles en route to the
first touchdown. Smith ran over
from the six for the score.
Brodie then passed 40 yards to
R. C. Owens for another score, I
and set up a third with a 28-yard
toss to Owens that culminated I
with C. R. Roberts diving over |
fi*om the one.
Mason, a rookie from Tulane,
turned in some brilliant sprints on
the first Minnesota drive with
runs of five, 19 and nine yards—
the latter to score.
Tommy Davis kicked a 42-yard
field goal for San Francisco be
fore Minnesota scored again on a
17-yard pass from Francis Tarken
ton to Jerry Reichow.

The other two Forty-Niner
touchdowns came in the third and
fourth quarters when Smith ran
one in from the 15 and Brodie, on
a keeper, scored from the 16.
Tarkenton completed an aerial
to Gordon Smith who scored from

71 yards in the third period and the
Vikings quarterback picked up the
final Minnesota tally with a one
yard plunge.
