## EIGHT LOSSES FOR BEARS Levy Dismayed over Early Hibernation 
### 
It was young Marv Levy, look-,
ing very tired and very disappoint
ed, who sat trying to explain why |
his Golden Bears had just suffered
their eighth loss of the season, 20- |
17 at the hands of Stanford in the
64th Big Game Saturday.
The California coach cited the
Indians’ ability to come up with
big plays on critical third down
situations to keep their drives go
ing along with some inopportune
penalties and a fumble on a sure
touchdown play on the part of his
Bears as contributing to the Ber- !
keleyites’ defeat.
LEVY I'KAISKI) Jack Curtice’s
Cards, “One thing about (Stan
ford), they came up with three or
four big plays on third down.
That’s what kept them moving.”

Then the UC montor added that,
“all season Stanford was the bet
ter defensive team.” Levy went on
to explain that given two teams of
equal ability, the better team de
fensively will win nine out of ten
times.”

Commenting further on the
Stanford defense, Levy told the
press, “I'm not discrediting Stan
ford’s offense, but I’m convinced
their defense hurt us more.”
As for the Indian offense, “they
just took advantage of some gold
en opportunities.”
LEW HAD TO admit that
George Pierovich’s fumble on a
dive into the Tribe end zone, which
was recovered by Stanford’s Gary
Sargent for a louchback, was the
turning point of the game.

The fumble came after the Bears
had taken the second half kickoff
and driven all the way to the
Card’s 3-yard line. Instead of a
touchdown that would have made
the score 13-7, Cal lost the ball and
the game.
Reluctant to place the blame
with the Bear fullback. Levy wrote
the fumble off on “a wet ball. I'm

sure though, that with normal
luck, Piorovich would have gone
in.”
ANOTHER BAD break for the
Berkeley Bears came in the fourth
quarter when junior quarterback
Randy Gold failed in a fourth and
one situation on the 50-yard line.
Behind by 20-7, California was
threatening to make a game of it
before Gold’s sneak was short by
inches.
According to Gold’s tearful ac
count of the play, he had the first
down but was carried back by a
Stanford tackier and the referee
set the ball down short.
Levy recalled that he had never
seen Gold cry in two years at Cali
fornia, but convinced that he had
made a first down, he had tears in
his eyes on returning to the bench.

“I HAVE NO quarrel with the
officiating,” said Levy, but he
wont on to say that inopportune
penalites “took the wind out of our
sails not only in the first half, but
also in the second half when wo
started to move.”
The youthful Bear headman
rounded out his comments with
the observation that this year’s
strong freshman grid team would
help out tremendously next year,
“and if we can get another (good
frosh team ) next year, wo can play
championship football.”
