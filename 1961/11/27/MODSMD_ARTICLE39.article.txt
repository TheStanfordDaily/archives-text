# Baseball Remains 'Dry'; WCTU Triumphs Again
## 
### 
TAMPA, Fla. (UPI) Baseball
remained “dry” yesterday when
the official rules committee voted
down a proposal to legalize the
spit ball.
By an overwhelming vote of 8
to 1, the rules committee rejected
a move to bring back the spitter
even though baseball Commis
sioner Ford Frick and American
League President Joe Cronin had
led a vigorous campaign to re
store it.
