# DEBATERS
## SU Women Win Honors At Fresno 
### 
Four Stanford women carried
off a total of ten trophies in the
Western Speech Association cham
pionships contested at Fresno
State College last Monday, Tues
day and Wednesday.
Barrie Thorne, a Lagunita soph
omore, was first in junior women’s
extemporaneous speaking, dis
cussing civil rights. Miss Thorne
combined with Karon Stucky of
Roth House to win second place in
debate in the same division.

THE TWO girls survived nine
rounds of competition, winning
debates on both sides of the propo
sition that “labor organizations
should be under the jurisdiction of
anti-trust laws,” only to lose a 2 to
1 judges’ decision in the final
round to a pair of Utah State girls
whom they had defeated the day
before.

Edith Brown and Ann Glashagel,
both of Lagunita, duplicated the
feat in senior women's debate, as
they were awarded second place,
losing to Los Angeles State in the
finals, also on a split decision.
Miss Brown also placed second
in impromptu speaking, requiring
an ability to speak about any topic
relating to international affairs
without any time for preparation.
For their efforts the girls received
six individual trophies of varying
sizes, and the school was awarded
four duplicates for display.

THE MALE speakers from tire
Farm found the going a bit rough
er among the 182 two-man teams
entered by 69 schools which com
peted in the championships. Barry
Carter and Dave Commons did the
best job, tying for sth place in the
junior men’s division.
The entire team contributed to
the winning of a sweepstakes
award, the eleventh trophy gar
nered by Stanford. The outstand
ing team performance is indicated
by the fact that Stanford, in plac
ing all five of its debate teams in
the final eliminations, was the only
school with more than three teams
left at that stage.
Speakers came from eleven
states, as far east as Colorado and
as far west at Hawaii, to debate in
this tournament.
