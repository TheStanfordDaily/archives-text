### GLENN ALFORD 
Finally.
We’ve got the axe.
STANFORD DUMPED Califor
nia all over the field 20-7 Saturday
in the 64th annual “Big Game.”
The issue was never in doubt.
Stanford dominated the game, and
in fact gifted the Golden Boars
with their only touchdown.
The first half was played in a

driving rain. It stopped falling
just before the end of the first half,
but by then the field was one big
cake of mud. and the numbers of
some players were for the most
part unrecognizable under the
dirt and slush.

Only a late fourth quarter pass
ing surge by Pete Olson, Cal’s
third string quarterback made the
statistics even respectable.
Card halfback Gary Craig play
ed one of the best games turned in
by a Stanford footballer this year,
with two touchdowns, and an in
tercepted pass to his credit, along
with generally playing a whale of
a game, both offensively and de
fensively.
THE QUARTERBACKING by
Jim Smith and Rod Sears was su
perlative. Smith in particular
seemed to call just the play that
the Cal defense wasn’t expecting,
allowing Craig, Hal Steuber, Ken
Babajian, Ed Cummings and Stan
Lindskog to bull through the Cal
line lor needed yardage.

Smith’s passing in the first half
was perfect, giving Stanford an in
surmountable lead. Smith com
pleted four passes in as many at
tempts in the first 30 minutes.
All of Smith’s first half passes
were completed in touchdown
drives. His first two were for 19
and 16 yards to put the ball on the
Cal 11. Ken Babajian ran the ball
four times, the last from half a
yard out for the score.
STAN LINDSKOG’S conversion
miss might be explained by the
cannon that some misguided zeal
ots exploded in the end zone. Lind
skog called time out, and then
booted one off to the right.
Smith’s passing set up the sec
ond touchdown. He completed a
swing pass to Babajian for a loss
of four yards, but hit Chris lessen
for a gain of 11. lessen made an
incredible leaping reception and
was clobbered from the rear by
Cal’s lack Trumbo. Trumbo never
hit anyone harder, but lessen held
onto the ball.

On the next play, a fourth down
and two yards to go, Craig took
Smith’s pitchout and rambled 24
yards for the clinching touchdown.
He got beautiful blocking from
end Bob Burke, wingback Danny
Spence and tackle Chuck Buehler,
who took out everybody in Craig’s
way. and Gary ran in untouched.
Lindskog’s conversion gave Stan
ford a 13-0 lead.
STANFORD'S FINAL score

The Axe Rally will be held
Thursday noon in front of the
Post Office in celebration of

sult of Stanford's victory over
California Saturday. This is
the first time in five years that
Stanford has won Big Game.
