# Tribe Dumps Bears, 20-7
## 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Finally.
We’ve got the axe.
STANFORD DUMPED Califor
nia all over the field 20-7 Saturday
in the 64th annual “Big Game.”
The issue was never in doubt.
Stanford dominated the game, and
in fact gifted the Golden Boars
with their only touchdown.
The first half was played in a

driving rain. It stopped falling
just before the end of the first half,
but by then the field was one big
cake of mud. and the numbers of
some players were for the most
part unrecognizable under the
dirt and slush.

Only a late fourth quarter pass
ing surge by Pete Olson, Cal’s
third string quarterback made the
statistics even respectable.
Card halfback Gary Craig play
ed one of the best games turned in
by a Stanford footballer this year,
with two touchdowns, and an in
tercepted pass to his credit, along
with generally playing a whale of
a game, both offensively and de
fensively.
THE QUARTERBACKING by
Jim Smith and Rod Sears was su
perlative. Smith in particular
seemed to call just the play that
the Cal defense wasn’t expecting,
allowing Craig, Hal Steuber, Ken
Babajian, Ed Cummings and Stan
Lindskog to bull through the Cal
line lor needed yardage.

Smith’s passing in the first half
was perfect, giving Stanford an in
surmountable lead. Smith com
pleted four passes in as many at
tempts in the first 30 minutes.
All of Smith’s first half passes
were completed in touchdown
drives. His first two were for 19
and 16 yards to put the ball on the
Cal 11. Ken Babajian ran the ball
four times, the last from half a
yard out for the score.
STAN LINDSKOG’S conversion
miss might be explained by the
cannon that some misguided zeal
ots exploded in the end zone. Lind
skog called time out, and then
booted one off to the right.
Smith’s passing set up the sec
ond touchdown. He completed a
swing pass to Babajian for a loss
of four yards, but hit Chris lessen
for a gain of 11. lessen made an
incredible leaping reception and
was clobbered from the rear by
Cal’s lack Trumbo. Trumbo never
hit anyone harder, but lessen held
onto the ball.

On the next play, a fourth down
and two yards to go, Craig took
Smith’s pitchout and rambled 24
yards for the clinching touchdown.
He got beautiful blocking from
end Bob Burke, wingback Danny
Spence and tackle Chuck Buehler,
who took out everybody in Craig’s
way. and Gary ran in untouched.
Lindskog’s conversion gave Stan
ford a 13-0 lead.
STANFORD'S FINAL score

The Axe Rally will be held
Thursday noon in front of the
Post Office in celebration of
the return of the Axe as a re
sult of Stanford's victory over
California Saturday. This is
the first time in five years that
Stanford has won Big Game.
Midway through the third quar
ter Cal punted deep into Stanford
territory. The Indians took over
on their own 24, and Stan Lind
skog ran 49 yards with a pitchout
around right end to the Cal 27.
Smith called Lindskog’s number
twice more, at guard for two yards,
and another pitchout for 21 yards.
Craig replaced the winded half
back and took another pitchout
around right end through four de
fenders to the final Stanford
touchdown. Lindskog recovered
in time to add his second conver
sion and Stanford had a fat 20-
point load.
CAL BROKE the scoring ice
with 2 minutes left in the third
quarter. Guard John Erby, who
was declared fit to play after suf
fering a concussion against Kan
sas, recovered a fumbled pitchout
on the Stanford 10.

Cal scored in three plays. Piero
vich blasted for five and two yards,
and Randy Gold rolled into the end
zone from three yards out. Jim
Ferguson converted and Stanford
had a 20-7 yead, the final margin.
Stanford dominated play, but
still had several tight spots. Cal
threatened right off the bat. Rod
Sears, playing with a bad case of
flu, fumbled a handoff and Larry
Lowell recovered for the Bears on
the Indian 43. Cal marched to the
29, but Gold fumbled on a rollout,
recovering for a loss of six.

A GOLD to Scattini rollout pass
W'as good for 13 yards, but a hold

ing penalty cost the Bears 22
yards, so they ended up back on
their own 41.
Stanford and California fooled
around for a while in the middle
of the field, but Smith’s passing
and line smashes by Baba.jian pul
the Indians on the scoreboard one
play into the second quarter.
Stanford forced Cal to punt fol
lowing the kickoff and began
another offensive. Smith used the
same formula. Steuber crashed
the line and Smith passed the In
lians to a fourth and two situation
on the Cal 24.

APPARENTLY the one play
Cal wasn’t expecting was a pitch
out, as they set for Steuber up the
middle. Craig was gone, with the
ferocious blocking of Burke and
Buehler.
To start the second half, Cal
opened like they were going to run
Stanford out of the Stadium.

In seven plays they moved to
the Indian one, but George Piero
vich fumbled after he crashed into
a pile of Card defenders at the
goal line. The ball spurted ten feet
up into the air, and Gary Sargent
pounced on it for a touchback.

THAT FINISHED Cal right
there, but they got a break when
a clipping penalty on a punt set
Stanford back on its 10, and the
fumble on the first play from
scrimmage handed the Bears the
ball ten yards from paydirt.
The Bears capitalized and re
duced the margin to thirteen with
the fourth quarter still to go.
The fourth quarter produced
some of the strangest doings ever
seen in Stanford Stadium. To be
gin with, the Stanford line showed
its mettle by stopping Pierovich
and Gold on successive plays for
a net of half a yard on third and
fourth downs with a yard to go.
MARV HARRIS and A1 Hilde-

came like a bolt out of the blue.

STANFORD DUMPED Califor
nia all over the field 20-7 Saturday
in the 64th annual “Big Game.”
The issue was never in doubt.
Stanford dominated the game, and
in fact gifted the Golden Boars
with their only touchdown.
The first half was played in a

driving rain. It stopped falling
just before the end of the first half,
but by then the field was one big
cake of mud. and the numbers of
some players were for the most
part unrecognizable under the
dirt and slush.

Only a late fourth quarter pass
ing surge by Pete Olson, Cal’s
third string quarterback made the
statistics even respectable.
Card halfback Gary Craig play
ed one of the best games turned in
by a Stanford footballer this year,
with two touchdowns, and an in
tercepted pass to his credit, along
with generally playing a whale of
a game, both offensively and de
fensively.
THE QUARTERBACKING by
Jim Smith and Rod Sears was su
perlative. Smith in particular
seemed to call just the play that
the Cal defense wasn’t expecting,
allowing Craig, Hal Steuber, Ken
Babajian, Ed Cummings and Stan
Lindskog to bull through the Cal
line lor needed yardage.

Smith’s passing in the first half
was perfect, giving Stanford an in
surmountable lead. Smith com
pleted four passes in as many at
tempts in the first 30 minutes.
All of Smith’s first half passes
were completed in touchdown
drives. His first two were for 19
and 16 yards to put the ball on the
Cal 11. Ken Babajian ran the ball
four times, the last from half a
yard out for the score.
STAN LINDSKOG’S conversion
miss might be explained by the
cannon that some misguided zeal
ots exploded in the end zone. Lind
skog called time out, and then
booted one off to the right.
Smith’s passing set up the sec
ond touchdown. He completed a
swing pass to Babajian for a loss
of four yards, but hit Chris lessen
for a gain of 11. lessen made an
incredible leaping reception and
was clobbered from the rear by
Cal’s lack Trumbo. Trumbo never
hit anyone harder, but lessen held
onto the ball.

On the next play, a fourth down
and two yards to go, Craig took
Smith’s pitchout and rambled 24
yards for the clinching touchdown.
He got beautiful blocking from
end Bob Burke, wingback Danny
Spence and tackle Chuck Buehler,
who took out everybody in Craig’s
way. and Gary ran in untouched.
Lindskog’s conversion gave Stan
ford a 13-0 lead.
STANFORD'S FINAL score

The Axe Rally will be held
Thursday noon in front of the
Post Office in celebration of
the return of the Axe as a re
sult of Stanford's victory over
California Saturday. This is
the first time in five years that
Stanford has won Big Game.
Midway through the third quar
ter Cal punted deep into Stanford
territory. The Indians took over
on their own 24, and Stan Lind
skog ran 49 yards with a pitchout
around right end to the Cal 27.
Smith called Lindskog’s number
twice more, at guard for two yards,
and another pitchout for 21 yards.
Craig replaced the winded half
back and took another pitchout
around right end through four de
fenders to the final Stanford
touchdown. Lindskog recovered
in time to add his second conver
sion and Stanford had a fat 20-
point load.
CAL BROKE the scoring ice
with 2 minutes left in the third
quarter. Guard John Erby, who
was declared fit to play after suf
fering a concussion against Kan
sas, recovered a fumbled pitchout
on the Stanford 10.

Cal scored in three plays. Piero
vich blasted for five and two yards,
and Randy Gold rolled into the end
zone from three yards out. Jim
Ferguson converted and Stanford
had a 20-7 yead, the final margin.
Stanford dominated play, but
still had several tight spots. Cal
threatened right off the bat. Rod
Sears, playing with a bad case of
flu, fumbled a handoff and Larry
Lowell recovered for the Bears on
the Indian 43. Cal marched to the
29, but Gold fumbled on a rollout,
recovering for a loss of six.

A GOLD to Scattini rollout pass
W'as good for 13 yards, but a hold

ing penalty cost the Bears 22
yards, so they ended up back on
their own 41.
Stanford and California fooled
around for a while in the middle
of the field, but Smith’s passing
and line smashes by Baba.jian pul
the Indians on the scoreboard one
play into the second quarter.
Stanford forced Cal to punt fol
lowing the kickoff and began
another offensive. Smith used the
same formula. Steuber crashed
the line and Smith passed the In
lians to a fourth and two situation
on the Cal 24.

APPARENTLY the one play
Cal wasn’t expecting was a pitch
out, as they set for Steuber up the
middle. Craig was gone, with the
ferocious blocking of Burke and
Buehler.
To start the second half, Cal
opened like they were going to run
Stanford out of the Stadium.

In seven plays they moved to
the Indian one, but George Piero
vich fumbled after he crashed into
a pile of Card defenders at the
goal line. The ball spurted ten feet
up into the air, and Gary Sargent
pounced on it for a touchback.

THAT FINISHED Cal right
there, but they got a break when
a clipping penalty on a punt set
Stanford back on its 10, and the
fumble on the first play from
scrimmage handed the Bears the
ball ten yards from paydirt.
The Bears capitalized and re
duced the margin to thirteen with
the fourth quarter still to go.

We’ve got the axe.
STANFORD DUMPED Califor
nia all over the field 20-7 Saturday
in the 64th annual “Big Game.”
The issue was never in doubt.
Stanford dominated the game, and
in fact gifted the Golden Boars
with their only touchdown.
The first half was played in a

driving rain. It stopped falling
just before the end of the first half,
but by then the field was one big
cake of mud. and the numbers of
some players were for the most
part unrecognizable under the
dirt and slush.

Only a late fourth quarter pass
ing surge by Pete Olson, Cal’s
third string quarterback made the
statistics even respectable.
Card halfback Gary Craig play
ed one of the best games turned in
by a Stanford footballer this year,
with two touchdowns, and an in
tercepted pass to his credit, along
with generally playing a whale of
a game, both offensively and de
fensively.
THE QUARTERBACKING by
Jim Smith and Rod Sears was su
perlative. Smith in particular
seemed to call just the play that
the Cal defense wasn’t expecting,
allowing Craig, Hal Steuber, Ken
Babajian, Ed Cummings and Stan
Lindskog to bull through the Cal
line lor needed yardage.

Smith’s passing in the first half
was perfect, giving Stanford an in
surmountable lead. Smith com
pleted four passes in as many at
tempts in the first 30 minutes.
All of Smith’s first half passes
were completed in touchdown
drives. His first two were for 19
and 16 yards to put the ball on the
Cal 11. Ken Babajian ran the ball
four times, the last from half a
yard out for the score.
STAN LINDSKOG’S conversion
miss might be explained by the
cannon that some misguided zeal
ots exploded in the end zone. Lind
skog called time out, and then
booted one off to the right.
Smith’s passing set up the sec
ond touchdown. He completed a
swing pass to Babajian for a loss
of four yards, but hit Chris lessen
for a gain of 11. lessen made an
incredible leaping reception and
was clobbered from the rear by
Cal’s lack Trumbo. Trumbo never
hit anyone harder, but lessen held
onto the ball.

On the next play, a fourth down
and two yards to go, Craig took
Smith’s pitchout and rambled 24
yards for the clinching touchdown.
He got beautiful blocking from
end Bob Burke, wingback Danny
Spence and tackle Chuck Buehler,
who took out everybody in Craig’s
way. and Gary ran in untouched.
Lindskog’s conversion gave Stan
ford a 13-0 lead.
STANFORD'S FINAL score

The Axe Rally will be held
Thursday noon in front of the
Post Office in celebration of
the return of the Axe as a re
sult of Stanford's victory over
California Saturday. This is
the first time in five years that
Stanford has won Big Game.
Midway through the third quar
ter Cal punted deep into Stanford
territory. The Indians took over
on their own 24, and Stan Lind
skog ran 49 yards with a pitchout
around right end to the Cal 27.
Smith called Lindskog’s number
twice more, at guard for two yards,
and another pitchout for 21 yards.
Craig replaced the winded half
back and took another pitchout
around right end through four de
fenders to the final Stanford
touchdown. Lindskog recovered
in time to add his second conver
sion and Stanford had a fat 20-
point load.
CAL BROKE the scoring ice
with 2 minutes left in the third
quarter. Guard John Erby, who
was declared fit to play after suf
fering a concussion against Kan
sas, recovered a fumbled pitchout
on the Stanford 10.

Cal scored in three plays. Piero
vich blasted for five and two yards,
and Randy Gold rolled into the end
zone from three yards out. Jim
Ferguson converted and Stanford
had a 20-7 yead, the final margin.
Stanford dominated play, but
still had several tight spots. Cal
threatened right off the bat. Rod
Sears, playing with a bad case of
flu, fumbled a handoff and Larry
Lowell recovered for the Bears on
the Indian 43. Cal marched to the
29, but Gold fumbled on a rollout,
recovering for a loss of six.

A GOLD to Scattini rollout pass
W'as good for 13 yards, but a hold

ing penalty cost the Bears 22
yards, so they ended up back on
their own 41.
Stanford and California fooled
around for a while in the middle
of the field, but Smith’s passing
and line smashes by Baba.jian pul
the Indians on the scoreboard one
play into the second quarter.
Stanford forced Cal to punt fol
lowing the kickoff and began
another offensive. Smith used the
same formula. Steuber crashed
the line and Smith passed the In
lians to a fourth and two situation
on the Cal 24.

APPARENTLY the one play
Cal wasn’t expecting was a pitch
out, as they set for Steuber up the
middle. Craig was gone, with the
ferocious blocking of Burke and
Buehler.
To start the second half, Cal
opened like they were going to run
Stanford out of the Stadium.

In seven plays they moved to
the Indian one, but George Piero
vich fumbled after he crashed into
a pile of Card defenders at the
goal line. The ball spurted ten feet
up into the air, and Gary Sargent
pounced on it for a touchback.

THAT FINISHED Cal right
there, but they got a break when
a clipping penalty on a punt set
Stanford back on its 10, and the
fumble on the first play from
scrimmage handed the Bears the
ball ten yards from paydirt.
The Bears capitalized and re
duced the margin to thirteen with
the fourth quarter still to go.

gin with, the Stanford line showed
its mettle by stopping Pierovich
and Gold on successive plays for
a net of half a yard on third and
fourth downs with a yard to go.
MARV HARRIS and A1 Hilde-

came like a bolt out of the blue.
Finally.
We’ve got the axe.
STANFORD DUMPED Califor
nia all over the field 20-7 Saturday
in the 64th annual “Big Game.”
The issue was never in doubt.
Stanford dominated the game, and
in fact gifted the Golden Boars
with their only touchdown.
The first half was played in a

driving rain. It stopped falling
just before the end of the first half,
but by then the field was one big
cake of mud. and the numbers of
some players were for the most
part unrecognizable under the
dirt and slush.

Only a late fourth quarter pass
ing surge by Pete Olson, Cal’s
third string quarterback made the
statistics even respectable.
Card halfback Gary Craig play
ed one of the best games turned in
by a Stanford footballer this year,
with two touchdowns, and an in
tercepted pass to his credit, along
with generally playing a whale of
a game, both offensively and de
fensively.
THE QUARTERBACKING by
Jim Smith and Rod Sears was su
perlative. Smith in particular
seemed to call just the play that
the Cal defense wasn’t expecting,
allowing Craig, Hal Steuber, Ken
Babajian, Ed Cummings and Stan
Lindskog to bull through the Cal
line lor needed yardage.

Smith’s passing in the first half
was perfect, giving Stanford an in
surmountable lead. Smith com
pleted four passes in as many at
tempts in the first 30 minutes.
All of Smith’s first half passes
were completed in touchdown
drives. His first two were for 19
and 16 yards to put the ball on the
Cal 11. Ken Babajian ran the ball
four times, the last from half a
yard out for the score.
STAN LINDSKOG’S conversion
miss might be explained by the
cannon that some misguided zeal
ots exploded in the end zone. Lind
skog called time out, and then
booted one off to the right.
Smith’s passing set up the sec
ond touchdown. He completed a
swing pass to Babajian for a loss
of four yards, but hit Chris lessen
for a gain of 11. lessen made an
incredible leaping reception and
was clobbered from the rear by
Cal’s lack Trumbo. Trumbo never
hit anyone harder, but lessen held
onto the ball.

On the next play, a fourth down
and two yards to go, Craig took
Smith’s pitchout and rambled 24
yards for the clinching touchdown.
He got beautiful blocking from
end Bob Burke, wingback Danny
Spence and tackle Chuck Buehler,
who took out everybody in Craig’s
way. and Gary ran in untouched.
Lindskog’s conversion gave Stan
ford a 13-0 lead.
STANFORD'S FINAL score

The Axe Rally will be held
Thursday noon in front of the
Post Office in celebration of
the return of the Axe as a re
sult of Stanford's victory over
California Saturday. This is
the first time in five years that
Stanford has won Big Game.
Midway through the third quar
ter Cal punted deep into Stanford
territory. The Indians took over
on their own 24, and Stan Lind
skog ran 49 yards with a pitchout
around right end to the Cal 27.
Smith called Lindskog’s number
twice more, at guard for two yards,
and another pitchout for 21 yards.
Craig replaced the winded half
back and took another pitchout
around right end through four de
fenders to the final Stanford
touchdown. Lindskog recovered
in time to add his second conver
sion and Stanford had a fat 20-
point load.
CAL BROKE the scoring ice
with 2 minutes left in the third
quarter. Guard John Erby, who
was declared fit to play after suf
fering a concussion against Kan
sas, recovered a fumbled pitchout
on the Stanford 10.

Cal scored in three plays. Piero
vich blasted for five and two yards,
and Randy Gold rolled into the end
zone from three yards out. Jim
Ferguson converted and Stanford
had a 20-7 yead, the final margin.
Stanford dominated play, but
still had several tight spots. Cal
threatened right off the bat. Rod
Sears, playing with a bad case of
flu, fumbled a handoff and Larry
Lowell recovered for the Bears on
the Indian 43. Cal marched to the
29, but Gold fumbled on a rollout,
recovering for a loss of six.

A GOLD to Scattini rollout pass
W'as good for 13 yards, but a hold

ing penalty cost the Bears 22
yards, so they ended up back on
their own 41.
Stanford and California fooled
around for a while in the middle
of the field, but Smith’s passing
and line smashes by Baba.jian pul
the Indians on the scoreboard one
play into the second quarter.
Stanford forced Cal to punt fol
lowing the kickoff and began
another offensive. Smith used the
same formula. Steuber crashed
the line and Smith passed the In
lians to a fourth and two situation
on the Cal 24.

APPARENTLY the one play
Cal wasn’t expecting was a pitch
out, as they set for Steuber up the
middle. Craig was gone, with the
ferocious blocking of Burke and
Buehler.
To start the second half, Cal
opened like they were going to run
Stanford out of the Stadium.

In seven plays they moved to
the Indian one, but George Piero
vich fumbled after he crashed into
a pile of Card defenders at the
goal line. The ball spurted ten feet
up into the air, and Gary Sargent
pounced on it for a touchback.

THAT FINISHED Cal right
there, but they got a break when
a clipping penalty on a punt set
Stanford back on its 10, and the
fumble on the first play from
scrimmage handed the Bears the
ball ten yards from paydirt.
The Bears capitalized and re
duced the margin to thirteen with
the fourth quarter still to go.
The fourth quarter produced
some of the strangest doings ever
seen in Stanford Stadium. To be
gin with, the Stanford line showed
its mettle by stopping Pierovich
and Gold on successive plays for
a net of half a yard on third and
fourth downs with a yard to go.
