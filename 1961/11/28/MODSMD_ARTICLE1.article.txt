# Russ Propose New Disarmament Plan
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPI) The Soviet
Union, which exploded at least
50 nuclear devices in the past
three months, yesterday called on
the United Stales, Britain and
France to agree to what it de
scribed as a “new approach” on
ending nuclear weapons tests.
The "new approach” included
a proposal that France take part
in the nuclear test ban talks in
Geneva; that the four powers
sign an agreement to end tests
in the atmosphere, outer space,
and underground; and that a
moratorium be declared on un
derground tests pending agree
ment of an international control
system under general and com
plete disarmament.
THK PROPOSALS were made
in a Soviet draft agreement to
be submitted to the three-power
test ban conference which will
be resumed in Geneva Tuesday.
Copies of the draft were distrib
uted here to foreign newsmen and
ambassadors.
Western sources in Geneva said
the Soviet plan amounted to an
indefinite test ban moratorium
without controls and appeared to
have put off any hopes for an
East-West agreement indefinitely.
These observers said the re

lease in Moscow of the plan 24
hours ahead of the opening of
the conference indicated the
Kremlin was trying to offset the
propaganda setback caused by its
unilateral abrogation of the vol
untary moratorium on Sept. 1.
THK GENEVA talks were re
cessed shortly after Russia began
the series of nuclear tests in the
Arctic Ocean and Siberia, includ
ing the explosion of a 50-megaton
plus bomb. The talks are being
resumed at the request of the
United States and Britain.
The Soviets proposed a four
point draft agreement to end
tests in the air and under water
that called for the use of existing
national detection systems.
They said any final'control sys
tem must be part of an agree
ment on general and complete
disarmament, a point that has
been opposed by the United States
and Britain.
IN CALLING for the first time
for French participation in the
talks which began in October
1958, the Foreign Ministry said:
“It is high time to put an end
to the double game of the West
ern powers when some NATO
members negotiate on a test ban
while others, with the tacit ap
proval of their Allies, continue
to explode nuclear bombs, to per
fect these weapons, strengthen
ing the military potential of the
NATO bloc.”
France tested its first atomic
bomb in February 1960 and ex
ploded three more in its Sahara
proving grounds since. Only last
week. French President Charles
do Gaulle said he intended to
equip his armed forces with stra
tegic and tactical nuclear weap
ons as soon as possible.
