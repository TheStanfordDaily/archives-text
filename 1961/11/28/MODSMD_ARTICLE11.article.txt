(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
first of several articles to run (his
week from two Stanford students
currently studying at f lie Free Uni
versity of Berlin. They are based
mainly on interviews with a re
cent refugee from East Berlin
(whose real name has been
changed to Klaus in these articles
because be still has relatives in
East Berlin) who is studying at the
Free University. Other informa
tion was gathered through person
al experience and through talking
with other refugees.
Steve Freidberg is a former
Daily editor and was graduated in
international relations last June.
Wil Kohl was graduated in politi
cal science in June and is on a
West German government study
grant.)

BERLIN—The wall through the
center of Berlin has not only sep
arated two parts of a city. It has
divided two different ways of life,
two different standards of living,
and of course, two greatly varying
political systems.
Many of the contrasts existed
before the now infamous date of
Aug. 13 when the “Chinese Wall’’
was begun; other differences have
since resulted and have been solidi
fied by means which could not be
employed while an escape route
still existed in Berlin.

The methods and goals of a to
talitarian state have altered the
lives of the East Berliner and Ger
mans in the Russian zone. This
change has influenced all phases
of existence from the physical fa
cade of East Berlin to the deep so
cial structure of the people.

THE MOST obvious contrasts
with West Germany and the West
ern world as a whole are evident
to one who drives through the
streets of the eastern sector of Ber
lin.

On virtually every government
building are red banners proclaim
ing that socialism will conquer,
that West Berlin must be demili
tarized, or that all must work hard
for the victory over Western im
perialism, Large areas of the sec
tor, the former center of Berlin
before the war, are vacant or cov
ered with ruins.

There are, to be sure, many
building projects, and noticeable
progress has been made in the last
three years in rehabilitating de
stroyed areas.

HOWEVER, in comparison with
West Berlin, East Berlin is many
years behind. Along the modern
Stalinalle (now renamed Frank
furteralle in accordance with de
stalinization) fronts are falling
off buildings five years old and
balconies had to be propped up
after two years.

In spite of numerous broad
streets, traffic is very light, and
the sidewalks are relatively un
crowded even on weekends. None
theless, there are “Vopos” (Peo
ple’s Policemen) at numerous
crossings, apparently with vexy

little to do. At night East Berlin,
a city of 1.1 million inhabitants, is
quiet, the streets are almost de
serted, and house lights go off at
an early hour.
The everyday existence of the
people reflects the influences of
the Ulbricht regime. For example,
the standard of living is consider
ably lower than in the West. Ac
cording to Klaus, if the official ex
change rates for East and West
marks are ignored, the ratio in
buying power for West to East
marks is two to one, i.e., the work
er in the East can buy proportion
ally one-half as much as his West
ern counterpart with the same
wages.
THE AVERAGE salary in the
East, for workers, clerks, etc., is
between 370 and 500 East marks
per month, of which 20 per cent is
taken for taxes. Foremen and man
agers earn roughly 900 marks, and
doctors, the highest paid, can earn
up to 2,100 marks.
Comparing prices it can be seen
that with the exception of rent,
which is about one and a half
times more in the West, most
goods are more expensive in the
East. Groceries, for example, are
often three times the price in the
West, particularly fruits, vege
tables and dairy products. And in
addition to being expensive, these
goods are rare, so that the East
German has a relatively small
choice. As a result there is a great
deal of hoarding when such goods
are available.

One persons needs between 80
and 100 marks per week for
clothes, food and rent; so it is gen
erally necessary that both man
and wife work, especially when
they have children. However, it is
still possible to save money as both
can eat and receive medical care
virtually free if they work in a fac
tory and thereby avoid a part of
their expenses.
AND THUS THE contradiction
results that there is an over-sup
ply of money in the East, for al
though people save, there is but a
meager selection of goods to
choose from. The money is usually
saved for a number of years to buy
luxury items such as refrigera
tors, washing machines or cars,
which are all extremely scarce and
expensive.

For example, a television set
costs 1,800 marks, approximately
four months average wages, and
can be had only after a certain
period of waiting. Cars, the high
est symbol of prestige, cost any
where from 8,000 marks for the
Trabant, the most inexpensive
with a waiting list of five years, to
the Moskowitch for 16,000 witlx a
waiting list of three years. Used
cars are as costly as new ones be
cause thei’e are so few available.
Gasoline is roughly tw r o and a half
times as expensive as in West Ger
many.
A certain amount of entertain
ment is available, although this is
strictly controlled by the govern
ment. Western films are shown
but only those which exhibit self
criticism. Eastern films, including
some from Russia, are mostly po
litical. The operas and theaters
are good but seldom crowded.
IN SPITE OF THE high cost and
waiting period television sets are
numerous. However, since Aug. 13
commando squads of the youth or
ganization check homes in the eve
ning to prevent listening to West
ern stations and tear down anten
nas pointed to the West. Yet large
numbers of the population persist
in listening to Western television
and radio stations.
Medical care has become one of
the greatest problems in the zone
due to the lack of doctors and med
icines. Before the wall was erected,
large numbers of medical men fled
1o the West, so that large areas of
East Germany were left without
medical aid, particularly special
ized help.
Five hundred doctors, mostly
young medical students, were
brought from Hungary to allevi
ate the situation. Importation of
western medicines has been pro
hibited; and although enough are
stored up to last three or four
months, a serious pi'oblem may re
sult after these are gone.
Those have been just a few of
the aspects of life in East Ger
many. However it is evident just
in these facts that, although prog
ress has been made in the East to
improve the lot of the people,
there still exists a substantial dif
ference in the standard of living
compared with the West. How this
difference is reflected in the work
of the people and the organization
of the society will be the subjects
of following articles.
