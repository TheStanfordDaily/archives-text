FROSH SPEAKS
Editor, The Daily:
Despite the editor’s anti-fresh
man prejudice, the freshman class
does have a right to this Big Game
victory.
The Class of ’65 has uphold ad
mi I’ably the spirit of the Immortal
21 in pre-Big Game activities.
Neither Daily articles nor yester
day’s editorial mentioned the
“Campanile” bonfire or the distri
bution of the “Beat Cal” edition of
the Daily Cal.
We don’t ask for appreciation,
but only that our class not be slan
dered in the exercise of its Big
Game duty.
Of course we “only know vic
tory.” We are grateful to the up
perclassmen and the football team
for allowing us this privilege.
May “the increasing fx-ivolous
ness of youth” always contribute
to victory!
Steve Murray
(EDITOR’S NOTE: Mr. Murray
apparently misread the editorial,
which was presented in a tongue
in-cheek vein and not meant to dis
credit the freshman class.
On the contrary, we think the
freshmen this year have on the
whole acted admirably while at the
same time showing the necessary
amount of respect for the upper
classmen. Far be it from us to get
the frosh maxi; they outnumber
us.)
