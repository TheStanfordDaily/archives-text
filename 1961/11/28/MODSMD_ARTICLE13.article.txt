## On Winning the Cold War 
### 
Recently in Seattle the Presi
dent delivered an address arguing
that he would not surrender to or
appease the Soviet Union and that
he would try to negotiate with it.
A few days later, Sen. Goldwater
restated the central thesis of his
foreign policy, which is that we
shall be failing in our conflict with
the Soviet Union until the Presi
dent declares that his objective is
“victory.”
This theory has recently been
expounded at length by Lite maga
zine. “Mere ‘patience and firm
ness,’ ” it says, “have been unable
to stop the one-way course of the
cold war.” It then goes on to say
that “no Western government has
yet made the winning of the Cold
War and thus the actual defeat of
Communism its official policy. Yet
the U.S. i-s in the Cold War by Com
munist decree; and, as Gen. Doug
las Mac Arthur has said, ‘lt is fatal
to enter any war without the will
to win it.’ Why then hasn’t the U.S.
openly made it our official policy
to win the Cold War and thereby
put the world on active notice of
our intent that Communism will
recede?”
What is the matter with these
reticent Western governments? A
close reading of the passage I have
quoted will show that it begins
with a clarion call for the actual
defeat of Communism and ends
with a less-than-clarion call that
“Communism will recede.” No one
knows better than Gen. Mac A
rthur, the hero of the Inchon land
ing, which forced the North Ko
reans back to the 38th Parallel,
that there is a world of difference
between forcing an adversary to
recede and imposing a defeat upon
him.
THK WESTERN governments
know this. For they have been
through it all before, indeed twice
before. The argument which has
now been raised in this country by
Sen. Goldwater is an old one and
their experience with the Gold
water policy covers the two World
Wars. It has been a bitter experi
ence, and if Sen. Goldwater knew
more about the history of the
twentieth century, he would real

ize that what tie wants the United
States and its allies to do is once
again make their objective the un
conditional surrender of the ad
versary.

In (ho first World War Wilson
wanted to negotiate a peace, he
wanted “peace without victory.”
The Goldwaters of that time howl
ed him down, and the war went on
for that ghastly year in which the
flower of French, British, and Ger
man manhood was decimated. In
the end the Germans were defeat
ed absolutely and at frightful cost,
and out of that victory came the
dictated Peace of Versailles. In the
aftermath was Adolf Hitler,

In the second World War the Al
lies compounded the fatal mistake
of unconditional surrender by the
equally fatal mistake, caused by
the memory of the massacres of
1917, of trying to avoid war by ap
peasement.

THE TWO GREAT lessons of
the second World War are, first,
that you cannot deal with an ag
gressor by appeasement and, sec
ond, that you cannot make a liv
able peace by unconditional sur
render. The Western governments,
including our own, have had this
experience and they have learned
these lessons. That is why they are
defending West Berlin. They will
not surrender it to obtain quiet.
And that is why they are not call
ing for the unconditional surrend
er of the Soviet Union, but are pre
paring to negotiate with it.

Life # magazine, in plumping for
a policy which has failed disas
trously in two World Wars, is
moved by the belief that mere pa
tience and firmness have been un
able to stop “the one-way course
of the Cold War.” I submit that
this is bad reporting and that it is
untrue that the Cold War is on a
“one-way course” in favor of Com
munism.
In the great central regions of
the Western world, there is now
underway a renaissance of vitali

ty, the like of which has not been
seen for generations. It is to lack
perspective to talk as if the Cold
War were going to be won or lost
in Cuba or Vietnam, and other
quite secondary theaters of con
flict. The real issue of the Cold
War is the conflict and competi
tion of the Soviet Union plus China
with Western Europe plus North
America. Far from receding in this
contest, we have every reason to
think that we are advancing. For
the brilliant growth of Soviet in
dustry is now fully matched by the
growth of Western European in
dustry. And in agriculture the su
periority of the Western world is
so great that Red China in its des
perate hunger has already begun
to put out feelers for help from
the West.

IN THIS consolation and ad
vance of the Western society lies
the true way to do what all of us
want to see done, to act so that,
as Life magazine puts it, “Com
munism will recede.” But Commu
nism cannot be made to recede in
Eastern Europe by demanding the
unconditional surrender of the So
viet Union. Eastern Europe has
not forgotten the German inva
sions and it needs for its security
a balance of power between East
and West.
But Communism will recede if,
as we consolidate the Atlantic
Community, we also reduce the
threat of war between East and
West. The abounding prosperity
with freedom in the West will act
as an enormous magnet upon
Eastern Europe. The reduction of
the threat of war will act to relax
the grip of the Soviet Union upon
the satellite countries.
Mere patience and firmness are
indeed not enough. They are indis
pensable, however. But there must
be also constructive statesmanship
which can foresee the future that
can be made and can remember
the lessons of the past.
