# INDIVIDUAL OPINION
## Perils of Groups 
### DEREK DAVIS Daily Staff Writer 
I am a leftist. I say this not so
much because I believe it, as be
cause no one seems to understand
the words of one who does not
have an accepted label. I am not a
rightist and am not particularly
moderate, therefore 1 must be a
leftist. Such is the logic generated
by a modern reverence for termi
nology which would have been per
fectly at homo in some of the les
ser manifestations of Scholastic
philosophy.
But per haps this has been true
of all generations of all eras. If you
weren’t a Tory you were a Whig.
If you weren’t for Caesar you were
agin’ him. What compounds the
evil today is the artificially created
need to cluster in groups and to
hide behind the group whenever
an opinion is demanded.
As an instance, I bring up the re
cent column by Ross Hermann
which has produced such a show
of hurt feelings from any number
of groupers who feel that they
have been personally insulted be
cause their groups have been at
tacked.
MUCH AS THE views of fellow
staffer Mr. Hermann often bring
a blush of embarrassment on my
normally pallid cheeks, I have a
great deal of respect for the fact
that he seldom submits to the
temptation to identify himself
with one or another popular move
ment, but is willing to speak out
on his own, taking the responsi
bility for his statements on his
own shoulders (and with some of
his statements, this represents a
responsibility of fearful dimen
sions).

The fact is that he did find a ser
ious flaw in the Student Peace
Union, one which is applicable to
almost every group around today,
from the John Birch Society to
SANE. The flaw is that what
starts out as a group of individu
als with a common interest, al
most invariably ends up as a slo
gan-bearing array of misfits and
mental midgets who have joined
for the sake of joining.
Each of these groups carries a
certain amount of prestige in one
situation or another. A small but
ton with a peculiar device on it
means that you are most definite
ly “in,” no matter what your per
sonal philosophy (if any) may be.
PEACE GROUPS, I suppose,
are especially susceptible to this.
Being for peace is being progres
sive, so the Lesser Unwashed
(those who are unwashed for ef
fect, as opposed to the Great Un
washed, who cannot afford soap)
find that they can be both progres
sive and unkempt at the same
time, a delightful combination.
That Mr. Hermann took the
fringes to symbolize the group
may seem unfair, but at times it
appears that the fringes grow to
the point where they envelop and
almost destroy (he good intentions
of the original group - and I know
of no group which has basically
better intentions than the Student
Peace Union.

But how, you say, is this to be
avoided? Perhaps by being a little
less anxious to have the biggest
group on the block and a little
more concerned with providing a
meeting ground for individuals
who are genuinely interested in
the basic question at hand, wheth
er it be rooting out the Communist
bogie-man or appealing for world
peace.

YOU CAN'T KEEP out all the
long-haiied hangers-on, but you
can refuse membership to those
who have nothing to offer but a
sneer and a platitude. And those
who would follow the group ban
ner along the way can be discour
aged by a few good applications
of t he “go way boy, ya bodda me”

technique.
A little less joining and a little
more thought might also be a nice
change. Why, for instance, does
a letter to the editor today aver
age approximately two-and-a-half
signatures? Is it really necessary
for four, six or “37 residents of
Wilbur Hall” to group together to
express an opinion? Whose opin
ion is it then?
For once I think I must (shud
der) agree with Barry Goldwater
and lament the phenomenon of the
“vanishing individual.” (To be
fair, an occasional example, such
as the original comment on Shirer,
will show a certain degree of unor
thodoxy and careful consideration,
but for the most part, groupism
and catch-wordism are the order
of the mass-produced letter.)
TO THE JOINER, this must
sound like a form of mental isola
tionism. All I ask, though, is that
