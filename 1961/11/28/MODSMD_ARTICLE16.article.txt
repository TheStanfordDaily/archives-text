Editor, Tile Daily:
In The Daily of November 22,
Mr. Brooks Otis took me to task
for not recognizing that, in the
classical Christian view, we are
all implicated in the guilt of the
crucifixion.
I assure Mr. Otis that I was
aware of this orthodox view and
that I had it in mind as I wrote my
letter about Canon Green. I wrote
that letter not because Canon
Green affirmed that view, but be
cause he burlesqued it.
In his statement—as reported
by The Daily—he was clearly talk
ing about the historical event of
the crucifixion. Had any of us been
present at that event, according to
the Canon, we would all have cried
“Crucify.” There was no alterna
tive action possible. (“I would
have said ‘Crucify,’ and so would
you. This is the human fact.”)

That statement is not Christian
orthodoxy, but nonsense. Maybe
as an historical fact all the wit
nesses to the crucifixion did cry
“Crucify” (though I would like to
see the Canon prove it!), but to
claim that they could not have
done otherwise is to make that
event, and human history gener
ally, meaningless. Is the Canon
trying to claim that pre-Christian
man had no free will, that he liter
ally could not decide between com
ing in out of the rain and staying
out in it ? Had the Jews no free will
in obeying or not obeying the Mo
saic Law? Was no question of
right and wrong involved in the

a person decide clearly for him
self (before a mirror if he cannot
go it alone) what his stand on an
issue is. then look carefully around
to see if he can find someone else
with more or less the same stand,
so that they can work toward a
common end. If a group forms
from this process, so much the
better. Communal effort is neces
sary to bring about any sort of no
ticeable effect.

But beware of annexing your
self to a group simply because it
has an attractive name or a noble
ideal sprinkled throughout the
clauses of its constitution. Even
more important, if you do form a
group of your own with the laud
able aim of world peace, for the
love of God, don’t call it HELP!

trial of Socrates? If men are mere
puppets, then of course their acts
have no moral significance. If this
is the Canon’s reading of history,
then he is more of a heretic than
(I suspect) he himself knows.
It is one thing to say that we are
implicated in the evil that men do.
It is quite another to say that we
all must engage, or participate ac
tively, in that evil. We are all cer
tainly implicated in the guilt of
Hiroshima, but that does not mean
we all voted in our hearts or minds
to drop the bomb, or that we all
wanted to be the one who pushed
the fatal button.
The Canon doesn’t seem able to
make this discrimination. Because
he would have said "Crucify,” he
can’t imagine anyone else behav
ing differently. It is shocking
enough to hear one of Stanford’s
honored guests brag about his ho
micidal impulses without having
him impute those same impulses
to his hosts. But more disturbing
than any breach of decorum is the
Canon’s moral confusion. Ho
thinks men had no free choice
when faced with the decision to
crucify or not to crucify Jesus,
but that they have all kinds of free
choice when faced with a decision
between French kissing and geni
tal fondling on a hot date. Has the
Canon, one wonders, really
thought this through?
Of course, our misunderstand
ings may arise, as Mr. Otis sug
gests, from Canon Green’s “some
what overpositive emphasis.” But
the trouble with such “overposi
tive” emphases is that they some
times swell into falsehoods.

claim that they could not have
done otherwise is to make that

trying to claim that pre-Christian
