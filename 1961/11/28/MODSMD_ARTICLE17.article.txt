UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. (UPI)
—The United States yesterday de
nounced the Chinese-Russian Com
munist alliance as history’s larg
est colonial empire, from which 12
million persons have fled since
World War 11.
U.S. Ambassador Adlai E. Ste
venson submitted a document in
connection with the General As
sembly’s drawn out debate on co
lonialism. Stevenson himself was
not present since he was in Port of
Spain, Trinidad, conferring with
Argentine President Arturo From
dizi.
“In its frenetic effort to cover
up its own dismal record in the
field of colonialism and human
rights,” Stevenson said, "The So
viet Union has levelled two prin
cipal charges against the United
States: 1.) The United States is
allied with colonialists and fi
nances colonialist wars; and 2.)
The United States is itself a coloni
al power...
“THE UNITED STATES is unal

terably opposed to all wars, includ
ing, of course colonialist wars. We
are not now and we shall never
become allied with any nation for
the purpose of planning, financing
or waging colonial wars . . .
“Secondly, we would hold no
people against its will. Wo are pre
pared to take the necessary mea
sures to consult any or all of the
approximately 100,000 people
whose destinies are still associated
with ours any time they request
it.”

Stevenson said Russia sought to
sidetrack the assembly from (he
“tried and true" procedures it had
followed in connection with coloni
alism for 15 years for two reasons.
“FIKST,” he said, “the Soviet
Union does not wish the United
Nations to operate successfully in
this or any other field. The Soviet
Union is fearful that the solution
of outstanding colonial problems
involving the West will impel the
United Nations to focus attention
on the situation in the vast Soviet
empire.
“Moreover, in the past 15 years,

as the process of self-determina
tion in the ex-colonial areas of
Asia and Africa was rapidly ex
panding the world community of
free and independent nations, the
contrary process was taking place
within the periphery of the Soviet
Union.
“More than 12 million persons
have escaped since the second
World War from the Soviet Union,
Communist China and the areas
they control.”
