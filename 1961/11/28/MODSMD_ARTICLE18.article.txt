# Personal Leadership Scarce, Expert Claims
## 
### 
Opportunities for traditional
type personal leadership in largo
organizations have become in
creasingly scarce, a Stanford ex-

pert contends.
"Modern organizations depend
less on the peculiar abilities of
rare individuals and more on or
derly research and analysis,” says
Prof. Alex Bavelas, director of
the new Laboratory of Human
Development, a joint venture of
the School of Business and De
partment of Psychology.
"Under normal operating con
ditions, leadership in the modern
organization consists not so much

in making decisions personally as
it does in maintaining a decision
making system.

"Quick, effective and daring
decisions are a highly valued
commodity in a crisis, but the art
of planning and organizing so
crises do not occur is equally
prized.
"The picture of the leader who
keeps his own counsel and in the
nick of time pulls the rabbit out
of the hat is out of date. The pop
ular stereotype now is the
thoughtful executive discussing
in committe the information sup
plied by a staff of experts.

"The brilliant innovator is in
creasingly viewed as an organi
zation hazard, rather than an
asset in management.
"There are two serious dangers
in this trend.

“First, we may be systemati
cally giving up opportunities for
using the highest expressions of
personal leadership in favor of
management practices whi c h,
while safe and reliable, can yield
at best only a high level of medi
ocrity.
“Second, in committing our
selves to a system that thrives
on the ordinary, we may tend to
shun the extraordinary in the in
terest of efficiency.

“It is no accident that daring
and innovation wane as an organ
ization grows large and success
ful. On different levels this ap
pears to have been the history of
men, of industries, of nations, and
even of societies and cultures.
“Success leads to obligations—
not the least of which is the obli
gation to hold what has been won.
Therefore, the energies of a
man or administration may be
absorbed in simply maintaining
vested interests. Similarly, great
size requires system, and system,
once established, may easily be
come an end in itself.”
