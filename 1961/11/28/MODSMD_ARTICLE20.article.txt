Young men choosing careers in
the oil industry have a promising
future, says a Stanford professor
of petroleum engineering.
Discussing the long-range out
look for the industry in a paper
prepared for the Society of Petro
leum Engineers of the American
Institute of Mining Engineers,
Frank G. Miller says:

â€œFor the past 25 years in the
United States, the energy con
sumption per capita bears a strik
ing correlation with real income
per capita. During this period the
consumption of inanimate energy
has increased about three per
cent annually.
