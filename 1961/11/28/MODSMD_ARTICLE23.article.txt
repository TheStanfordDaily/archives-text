CHRIS VON SALTZA, 1960 Olympic swimming champion, now a
Stanford freshman, urges Stanford students to use Christmas Seals
throughout the holidays. The 1961 Christmas Seal Campaign got
underway last Monday with the mailing of 162,000 letters contain
ing Christmas Seals. Voluntary contributions to the Seal Campaign
support research at Stanford, education and four chest X-ray cen
ters for the early detection of IB and other serious chest disorders.
