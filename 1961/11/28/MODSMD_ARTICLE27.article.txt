# Craig, Patitucci Picked by Writers
## 
### 
Sophomore end Frank Patitucci and junior halfback Gary Craig
were voted the outstanding lineman and hack respectively in Sat
urdayâ€™s Big Game by press box sportswriters. This is good news for
Card football fans, for both of these men will be back next season.
Craig had a great game as he skirted his own left end for a

24-yard touchdown and plunged
up the middle on a four-yard
tally. He also punted well and
fielded numerous California punts
flawlessly.
