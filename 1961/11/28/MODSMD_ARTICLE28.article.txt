Aided by its ladies’ auxiliary,
Stanford’s student Legislature
walked over Cal’s student Ex-
C'om Saturday morning in the
annual Big-Wig Bowl, 18-0.
Stars for the LASSIJ team
were Robb (Rabbit) Royse and
Bob (I Read tile Chronicle . . .)
Sayler. Sayler tossed a 50-yard
pass to Royse for one LASSU
TD and then connected with
Royse on a 20-yard scoring pass
later on.

Tile übiquitous Royse then
threw another 50-yard (LASSU
never does anything in a small
way) TD pass to Bill (Faster
than a Speeding Bullet) Calli
son to wrap up the scoring over
the inept Cal crew.
At one point the fein a I e
LASSU members were playing
for the Stanford team, as Coach
Ward (Collosns of the North)
McDonald cleared the bench.
