PATITUCCI was one of the
real bright spots of the 1961 cam
paign as he came through game
after game after regular Steve
Pursell injured his leg.
In the Big One Patitucci's best
offensive play was a sparkling
: grab of a Jim Smith aerial for
! 19 yards to open up the middle
a bit for the Card ground forces.
He also played a rugged game
on defense and was a strong
member of some of Cal's back
field maneuvers.
