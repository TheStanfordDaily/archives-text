# Writers Predict Third For Card Hoopsters
## 
### 
The Northern California Basketball Writers officially launched
the 1961-62 basketball season yesterday with their first meeting of
the year.
The first action for the sportswriters was the annual pre-season
poll to predict the top teams in the AAWU and the Western Col
legiate Athletic Conference*
(WCAC(. . _ .

The writers saw the AAWU
race a runaway for the Southern
California Trojans, with Wash
ington and Stanford to finish 2-3.
No mention was made of UCLA
and California.
The prediction for the WCAC
was Santa Clara, Loyola (Los
Angeles I, and San Jose State in
that order. Santa Clara had 168
votes, Loyola 96, and San Jose
Slate 30.
STANFORD basketball coach
Howie Dallman. whose charges
open their season Saturday
against USF at home, said that
Stanford would be considerably
improved this season. In particu
lar he singled out: senior forward
John Windsor, “he shows, con
sistency and should have a fine
year,” senior center Mike Ledg
erwood, “he has improved a great
deal.” and sophomore center Tom
Dose, who “has the potential to
become Stanford’s finest center.”
He said that Stanford’s double
vision duo. twins Don and Doug
Clemetsen, were a fine pair of
guards.
Commenting on Stanford’s pre
dicted third place finish in the
Big Five, Dallmar said that you
could look at it two ways. Stan
ford has been selected for third
place, or you could say that the
Tribe is predicted to finish two
places out of the league cellar.
CAL COACH Rene Herrerias,
whose Golden Bears are unranked
in the league’s top three for the
first time in a long while, be
moaned the Bears’ obvious lack
of experience, but promised that
Cal would surprise someone.
