# Third Place For Poloists
## 
### 
With a convincing 12-7 victory |
over Foothill College, Stanford’s |
varsity water polo team took j
third place in the Northern Cali
fornia Water Polo Champion
ships held last week in San Fran- i
cisco. The Indians lost their semi-1
final match to the Olympic Club’s
s u perior team, 10-4, although
turning in one of their best per
formances of the year.
IT WAS a fine year for both
of coach Jim Gaughran’s teams.
The varsity finished with a 10-7
record, quite an improvement
over last season, when they won
only three games. The freshman
team did even bettor, going un
defeated in 12 games.
Next year should be the best
yet, according to coach Gaugh- j
ran. Five first string sophomores I
and one junior are returning next |
season. Outstanding among these |
are Pete Pettigrew, high team
scorer, and Don Buehler, about
the team’s strongest guard.
A standout for the frosh this
year was Marty Hull, who scored
69 goals and connected on over
half of his shots.
