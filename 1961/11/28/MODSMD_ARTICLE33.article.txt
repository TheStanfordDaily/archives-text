# Rose Bowl Possible for OSU, Minnesota, Michigan State?
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO—(UPI)—Tom Hamilton, executive director
of the His Five, said yesterday that the choice for UCLA’s Rose
Bowl opponent had narrowed down to five teams with three of
them being Big Ten schools. Hamilton would not elaborate, but
the a mption was that the Big Ten choice was between Ohio

State, which has gone on record
as opposing a Rose Bowl bid and
beat UCLA earlier this season,
Minnesota and Michigan Slate.

ASKED IF Michigan State
(7-21 might be invited, Hamilton
only said, “they would be a good
team to bring out.”
There was no hint as to what
other teams were being consid
ered. Undefeated Alabama, which
appeared to he a prime choice,
has indicated that it will play in
the Sugar Bowl against Arkan
sas. Louisiana State, another
power, is set for the Orange Bowl
where it will face Colorado.

There has been great specula
tion on this year’s Rose Bowl rep
resentative from the eastern sec
tor. Last year Minnesota officials
voted against any further bowl
participation, but when their Gold
en Gophers won the Big Ten title,
1 hey quickly changed that ruling.
Ohio State has been one of the
most adamant of the Big Ten in
stating that a Rose Bowl contract
with the Big Five should not be
signed. But now the Buckeye’s of
Woody Hayes have proven to be
the Big Ten powerhouse.
Hamilton said that a selection
might not be announced until
after next Saturday’s games.
