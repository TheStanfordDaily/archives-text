# Married Student Housing Expanding
## 
### JANET ROSS 
Stanford facilities are expanding to meet increasing
demands for married student housing. By 1963, the Uni
versity’s married student housing program will be one
of the largest in the country.
Presently Escondido Village and Stanford Village are
the two University accommodations for married students.
Escondido is located on campus, beyond Wilbur Hall on
Escondido Road. Stanford Village is in Menlo Park, about
three miles from the University.
THE TREND for married students to continue their
education began after World War 11. Although first
thought to be temporary, this tendency has instead in
creased throughout the country.
The influx of married students, whose education was
interrupted by duty in the armed services and whose
general level of maturity was higher than previous under
graduates. introduced a new type of student to the college
campus as well as created a need for new accommoda
tions.
General Dibble Army Hospital was obtained by the
University to meet this housing need, and was converted
to Stanford Village in 1946.
SINCE Til AT TIME several changes have come about.
Some Village land has been sold to the Stanford Research
Institute, and dorms for single men have been established.
At present, 296 married couples live in the Village, 90
per cent of whom are graduate students, and 255 single
men, of whom 156 are grads and 99 arc seniors, juniors
and sophomores. The grads and undergrads may be busi
ness students (as in Rumley Hall), overflow transfer
students, or men who want single rooms and ask to be
there.
Escondido Village opened in August of 1959 as the
demand for married-student housing further increased.
Escondido presently has 250 apartments with 469 more
units to be added by 1963. Plans for new units are in the
process of approval, and construction is expected to begin

early next year.
APPROXIMATELY So million will be spent on the
construction of these new apartments. Costs will be de
frayed by a loan from the Federal Housing and Home
Finance Agency, to be repaid from apartment rentals.
The apartments will range in size from one to three
bedrooms. Three eight-story buildings, each containing
63 one-bedroom apartments, will be available for student
families without children.
There will be 188 two-bedroom units and 82 three
bedroom units in two-story buildings.
THE BUILDINGS will lie in a series of clusters around
an open area facing an inner Jadscaped core, similar to a
pioneers’ wagon train camped for the night.
The two-story units have been designed with bedroom
upstairs, so that, in the words of Dan Rolfs, Stanford
associate planner and project coordinator, “no one lives
over anyone else.”
The low buildings will be constructed of stucco and
redwood, with gabled roofs. The high-rise apartments will
be of textured reinforced concrete.
IN EACH CASE the architects have tried to provide
unrestricted views from each apartment. Every ground
level apartment will have its own private patio and each
cluster will have its own fully equipped children’s play
area.
More than $600,000 will be spent to furnish completely
all the apartments down to all-electric kitchens and dis
posals. The basements of the high-rise apartments will
contain washers and dryers for the tenants’ use.
"It is planned that by 1965 Stanford Village will be
completely relinquished to SRI, and that Escondido will
accommodate all married students,” said Director of
Married Student Housing F. E. Gallagher.
WAITING LISTS for both Villages are long, with ap
proximately nine months to a year waiting period. Prior
ity is given to veterans and servicemen in Stanford Vil
lage, otherwise position on ihe lists is determined by the

date the application reaches the Director’s Office.
Apartments in use now are primarily one-story units,
although there are some two-story buildings in Escondido
Village. Stanford Village has a studio unit but other
apartments are one-, two- or three-bedroom.
The current monthly rates, which include all utilities
and basic furnishings, range from $46 to $65 in Stanford
Village and from $B5 to $lO5 in Escondido. The number of
children determines the size of apartment which is as
signed.
“THE FAMILIES in both villages form communities
with unity of purpose and common grounds of under
standing,” Gallagher observed. They work together to
secure playgrounds and schooling for their children,
health programs, safety regulations, recreation and serv
ice benefits such as for laundry and baby sitting.
A family council was formed in both Villages as an
organizing body to establish the necessary standards and
regulations of the communities and to plan activities.
Representatives from the various courts and divisions
within the living groups attend the council meetings and
report to the other families in their courts.
THE FAMILY councils have sponsored such activities
as Halloween and Christmas parties, fashion shows and
bake sales and each fall they organize an open house for
newcomers to tour the apartments.
A cook book has just been published as a function of
the Stanford Village Council. A compilation of the wives'
favorite recipes, the cook book reveals that several inter
national students also live in the Village.
“In the family council small problems are treated be
fore they become major ones, so that when a problem is
presented to the administration, we know that it is a
general one. Communication between the University and
the students is thus facilitated,” said Gallagher.
Considering the cost of living, the housing program is
often helpful for students. “Sometimes,” as Gallagher
said, “these accommodations might decide whether a stu
dent is able to attend the University.”
