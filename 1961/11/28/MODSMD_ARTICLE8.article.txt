# 'Tough Training in Red Ways Needed By Gl's'-Thurmond
## 
### RON RAPOPORT Associate Editor 
Sen. Strom Thurmond said yes
terday it is important that military
officers, who are experts on Com
munism, be allowed to give tough
training about Communism to
troops.

The South Carolina Democrat
told a few hundred people in Me
morial Auditorium, “I know of no
danger from the military. They are
your brothers, your fathers, and
you should be proud of them. They
know the enemy.”
Thurmond said, “I don’t advo
cate that military officers should
get into partisan politics; they
don’t advocate that themselves.
But when officers in the Armed
Services can’t tell you about the
enemies of the country, then I say
we’ve gotten into a sad state of af
fairs.”

A CANDIDATE for president in
1948 on the States’ Rights ticket,
Thurmond said that the prime tar
get of the Communists in this
counry is the military because it
hurts the Communists the most.
Speaking of General Edwin
Walker, who resigned his army
post recently amidst a hot contro
versy over his alleged methods of
indoctrinating troops, Thurmond
said. “General Walker is one of the

greatest fighting men in United
States history.
“He is a natural leader of men.
He built up the finest fighting di
vision in Europe. Under his com
mand venereal disease went down,
church attendance went up and re
enlistments went up. He is a great
man and a great patriot.”
Thurmond quoted Walker as
having said that it is “burden
enough for troop commanders to
make an American of a man with
out making him a soldier and
make no mistake we have to make
them Americans before we can
make them soldiers.”
THURMOND SAID Walker in
doctrinated, taught and trained
men in Korea so they knew what
they were fighting for. The Sena
tor said that many United States
prisoners gave valuable informa
tion to the enemy when they were
captured in Korea. “They wouldn’t
have done this if they had had
proper training.”
IN A REMARK after the speech,
Thurmond said that the Congres
sional hearing into “muzzling the
military” which was to begin to
day, had been postponed until
January because the committee’s
staff wasn't ready yet.
He said that Walker may not
testify at the hearing because he
has filed a written statement but
that, “it is my impression that he
is ready to testify if he is wanted.”
The senator said that such
movies as “Operation Abolition,”
and "Communism on the Map”
had been withdrawn from circula
tion by the Defense Department
because the “liberal and left-wing
press” had been worked on by the
Communists and had “trotted off
with” the Communist line.

He said that “Operation Aboli
tion” showed how Congressional

hearings could be stopped by Com
munists when they were followed
by “misguided students, profes
sors and others.” Thurmond said,
“The demonstrations at those
hearings were a disgrace.

‘‘l SAW FOR my own eyes what
was taking place at the hearings,”
he said, noting he was in San Fran
cisco at the time for a military
seminar. “I know the film tells the
truth, but others have been mis
guided into believing that it’s un
true. The House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee says it’s true.”

“THOSE DOING damage to the
country are silent Socialists who
don’t have the courage to come out
in the open. They want a Socialist
government. There are other coun
tries in the world that have Social
ist governments. These people
ought to go there,” he said.
“The silent Socialists have been
in the State Department, the White
House, the CIA and in other
places,” he said without elabora
tion.

Citing Presidential assistant Ar
thur Schlesinger’s remark that the
best defense against Communism
is the Welfare State, Thurmond
said, “Why that’s no defense
against Communism. The Welfare
State leads to Socialism which
leads to Communism.”
IN DESCRIBING Communism,
Thurmond said, “We must start
from the premise that Commu
nism is a Godless ideology. You
can’t be a Communist and believe
in God and you can’t believe in God
and be a Communist.
“The Communists aim to domi
nate the earth and they’ve made
tremendous progress. We're not
in a shooting war, but we’re in a
war; a global war, a war for men’s
minds. The shooting war may
come later. It’s important for us
to know the enemy.”
Thurmond extolled the benefits
of America and of capitalism, say
ing that the United States has the
highest standard of living in the
world and far more material items
than any other country.

“You can get down on your
knees every night and thank your
God that you do live in the United
States,” he said in a statement
that was greeted with applause.

indoctrinating troops, Thurmond
said. “General Walker is one of the

greatest fighting men in United
States history.
“He is a natural leader of men.
He built up the finest fighting di
vision in Europe. Under his com
mand venereal disease went down,
church attendance went up and re
enlistments went up. He is a great
man and a great patriot.”
Thurmond quoted Walker as
having said that it is “burden
enough for troop commanders to
make an American of a man with
out making him a soldier and
make no mistake we have to make
them Americans before we can
make them soldiers.”
THURMOND SAID Walker in
doctrinated, taught and trained
men in Korea so they knew what
they were fighting for. The Sena
tor said that many United States
prisoners gave valuable informa
tion to the enemy when they were
captured in Korea. “They wouldn’t
have done this if they had had
proper training.”
IN A REMARK after the speech,
Thurmond said that the Congres
sional hearing into “muzzling the
military” which was to begin to
day, had been postponed until
January because the committee’s
staff wasn't ready yet.
He said that Walker may not
testify at the hearing because he
has filed a written statement but
that, “it is my impression that he
is ready to testify if he is wanted.”
The senator said that such
movies as “Operation Abolition,”
and "Communism on the Map”
had been withdrawn from circula
tion by the Defense Department
because the “liberal and left-wing
press” had been worked on by the
Communists and had “trotted off
with” the Communist line.

He said that “Operation Aboli
tion” showed how Congressional

hearings could be stopped by Com
munists when they were followed
by “misguided students, profes
sors and others.” Thurmond said,
“The demonstrations at those
hearings were a disgrace.

‘‘l SAW FOR my own eyes what
was taking place at the hearings,”
he said, noting he was in San Fran
cisco at the time for a military
seminar. “I know the film tells the
truth, but others have been mis
guided into believing that it’s un
true. The House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee says it’s true.”

“THOSE DOING damage to the
country are silent Socialists who
don’t have the courage to come out
in the open. They want a Socialist
government. There are other coun
tries in the world that have Social
ist governments. These people
ought to go there,” he said.
“The silent Socialists have been
in the State Department, the White
House, the CIA and in other
places,” he said without elabora
tion.

Citing Presidential assistant Ar
thur Schlesinger’s remark that the
best defense against Communism
is the Welfare State, Thurmond
said, “Why that’s no defense
against Communism. The Welfare
State leads to Socialism which
leads to Communism.”
IN DESCRIBING Communism,
Thurmond said, “We must start
from the premise that Commu
nism is a Godless ideology. You
can’t be a Communist and believe
in God and you can’t believe in God
and be a Communist.
“The Communists aim to domi
nate the earth and they’ve made
tremendous progress. We're not
in a shooting war, but we’re in a
war; a global war, a war for men’s
minds. The shooting war may
come later. It’s important for us
to know the enemy.”
Thurmond extolled the benefits
of America and of capitalism, say
ing that the United States has the
highest standard of living in the
world and far more material items
than any other country.

“You can get down on your
knees every night and thank your
God that you do live in the United
States,” he said in a statement
that was greeted with applause.

At 7:15 tonight, following fin*
7 o’clock news, KZSI r will
broadcast a tape recording of
Senator Thurmond’s speech.
Sen. Strom Thurmond said yes
terday it is important that military
officers, who are experts on Com
munism, be allowed to give tough
training about Communism to
troops.

The South Carolina Democrat
told a few hundred people in Me
morial Auditorium, “I know of no
danger from the military. They are
your brothers, your fathers, and
you should be proud of them. They
know the enemy.”
Thurmond said, “I don’t advo
cate that military officers should
get into partisan politics; they
don’t advocate that themselves.
But when officers in the Armed
Services can’t tell you about the
enemies of the country, then I say
we’ve gotten into a sad state of af
fairs.”

A CANDIDATE for president in
1948 on the States’ Rights ticket,
Thurmond said that the prime tar
get of the Communists in this
counry is the military because it
hurts the Communists the most.

Walker, who resigned his army

staff wasn't ready yet.
He said that Walker may not
testify at the hearing because he
has filed a written statement but
that, “it is my impression that he
is ready to testify if he is wanted.”
The senator said that such
movies as “Operation Abolition,”
and "Communism on the Map”
had been withdrawn from circula
tion by the Defense Department
because the “liberal and left-wing
press” had been worked on by the
Communists and had “trotted off
with” the Communist line.

He said that “Operation Aboli
tion” showed how Congressional

hearings could be stopped by Com
munists when they were followed
by “misguided students, profes
sors and others.” Thurmond said,
“The demonstrations at those
hearings were a disgrace.

‘‘l SAW FOR my own eyes what
was taking place at the hearings,”
he said, noting he was in San Fran
cisco at the time for a military
seminar. “I know the film tells the
truth, but others have been mis
guided into believing that it’s un
true. The House Un-American Ac
tivities Committee says it’s true.”

“THOSE DOING damage to the
country are silent Socialists who
don’t have the courage to come out
in the open. They want a Socialist
government. There are other coun
tries in the world that have Social
ist governments. These people
ought to go there,” he said.
“The silent Socialists have been
in the State Department, the White
House, the CIA and in other
places,” he said without elabora
tion.

Citing Presidential assistant Ar
thur Schlesinger’s remark that the
best defense against Communism
is the Welfare State, Thurmond
said, “Why that’s no defense
against Communism. The Welfare
State leads to Socialism which
leads to Communism.”
IN DESCRIBING Communism,
Thurmond said, “We must start
from the premise that Commu
nism is a Godless ideology. You
can’t be a Communist and believe
in God and you can’t believe in God
and be a Communist.
“The Communists aim to domi
nate the earth and they’ve made
tremendous progress. We're not
in a shooting war, but we’re in a
war; a global war, a war for men’s
minds. The shooting war may
come later. It’s important for us
to know the enemy.”
Thurmond extolled the benefits
of America and of capitalism, say
ing that the United States has the
highest standard of living in the
world and far more material items
than any other country.

“You can get down on your
knees every night and thank your
God that you do live in the United
States,” he said in a statement
that was greeted with applause.

At 7:15 tonight, following fin*
7 o’clock news, KZSI r will
broadcast a tape recording of
Senator Thurmond’s speech.
Sen. Strom Thurmond said yes
terday it is important that military
officers, who are experts on Com
munism, be allowed to give tough
training about Communism to
troops.

The South Carolina Democrat
told a few hundred people in Me
morial Auditorium, “I know of no
danger from the military. They are
your brothers, your fathers, and
you should be proud of them. They
know the enemy.”
Thurmond said, “I don’t advo
cate that military officers should
get into partisan politics; they
don’t advocate that themselves.
But when officers in the Armed
Services can’t tell you about the
enemies of the country, then I say
we’ve gotten into a sad state of af
fairs.”

A CANDIDATE for president in
1948 on the States’ Rights ticket,
Thurmond said that the prime tar
get of the Communists in this
counry is the military because it
hurts the Communists the most.
Speaking of General Edwin
Walker, who resigned his army
post recently amidst a hot contro
versy over his alleged methods of
indoctrinating troops, Thurmond
said. “General Walker is one of the

greatest fighting men in United
States history.
“He is a natural leader of men.
He built up the finest fighting di
vision in Europe. Under his com
mand venereal disease went down,
church attendance went up and re
enlistments went up. He is a great
man and a great patriot.”
Thurmond quoted Walker as
having said that it is “burden
enough for troop commanders to
make an American of a man with
out making him a soldier and
make no mistake we have to make
them Americans before we can
make them soldiers.”
THURMOND SAID Walker in
doctrinated, taught and trained
men in Korea so they knew what
they were fighting for. The Sena
tor said that many United States
prisoners gave valuable informa
tion to the enemy when they were
captured in Korea. “They wouldn’t
have done this if they had had
proper training.”
IN A REMARK after the speech,
Thurmond said that the Congres
sional hearing into “muzzling the
military” which was to begin to
day, had been postponed until
January because the committee’s
staff wasn't ready yet.
He said that Walker may not
testify at the hearing because he
has filed a written statement but
that, “it is my impression that he
