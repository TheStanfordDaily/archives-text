S °The importance of head control
We are told that bird watchers, who always take notes
while they watch, are able to keep one eye on the bird
and one eye on the notebook. Eye dexterity of this type
is also a great asset to the girl watcher. It enables him to
watch two girls at the same time, even when the girls are
sitting on opposite sides of a classroom. The beginner,
who must watch the girls one at a time in a situation of
this type, must learn to restrict his movements to the eye
balls. The girl watcher never moves his head. Undue
head-turning, particularly if it is accompanied by shouts
or whistles, is the sign of the amateur. (If you want some
thing to shout about, try a Pall Mall!)
