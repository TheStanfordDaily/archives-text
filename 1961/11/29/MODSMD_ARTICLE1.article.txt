# RADAR INVENTOR
## Sir Robert Tells Woes Of Scientist 
### BILL REPPY 
“The history of radar is littered
with remarkable stupidities per
petrated by otherwise intelligent
people,’’ said Sir Robert Watson-
Watt, developer of radar in Brit
ain.

Sir Robert in his Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture last night out
lined what he called "a catalogue
of follies" to show how foolish
ness of government officials de
layed Ihe application of radar in
both Germany and Britain.

When the ideas of radar were
demonstrated in 1925, he began,
no military applications of the
invention were invisioned.
THEN in 1928 scientists
brought to the British Admiralty
a “perfectly feasible method” of
measuring distance and direction
of aircraft by radar. But an ad
visor reported the idea to be
“quite impractical.” “His findings
were based on sheer ignorance,”
Sir Robert said.

In 1931 the British Army told
two young inventors who asked
for leave to develop their sound
theories of radar detection that
their scheme was “eccentric and
crazy.”
Finally in 1934 Winston Church
ill asked for an investigation of
radar as a possible defense
against attacking bombers. But
still lack of speed in acting cost
the government nine or 10
months delay in perfecting radar
as a detection device.

IN G E RMANY government
folly was oven worse, Sir Robert
said.

When the idea was first
brought to the government, an
advisor said i( wouldn't work.
The next time German scien
tists brought radar to the atten
tion of the government they were
directed to Marshall Hermann
Goering. He told the scientists
their plans were not worth devel
oping since the war was as good
as over. That was in 1940.

“Goering hadn’t the slightest
idea of the value of science,” Sir
Robert said. “I consider him one
of the most sturdy allies in the
success of British radar.”
When German scientists later
developed a plan to foil British
radar by planting small alumi
num strips in the air which would
simulate aircraft on radar
screens, Goering commanded all
records of the idea destroyed and
all mention of it stopped.
How do these follies of the past
pertain to the present?
They indicate, Sir Robert said,
that politicians refuse to keep up
with the increasingly rapid devel
opment of technology.
But this problem will not last
long, he said. In a few years sci
entists will be recognized as true
artists and creators just as paint
ers and composers are now recog
nized.
“I affirm this with pleasure and
confidence,” he said.
Sir Robert was knighted by
George VI for his role in devel
oping radar in Britain. “Radar is
my own contribution to the
t roubles of the world,” he
chuckled.
A charming little Scotchman
who speaks with a trace of ac
cent. Sir Robert sparkled with
wit throughout his lecture. His
choice of words provided a truly
delightful bombastic tone.
