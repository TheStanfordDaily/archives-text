# Kennedy Proposes Internationalization Of Berlin Lifeline
## 
### 
MOSCOW (UPI) President
Kennedy told the Russian people
yesterday there can be “peace in
this century” if the Berlin ques
tion is solved, and he proposed
internationalization of the high
way lifeline leading from the city
to West Germany.
Kennedy said that if the Soviet
Union would stick to its own na
tional interests and stop trying to
communize the world, one of the
great threats to American-Soviet
relations would be removed.

The blunt but not unfriendly
words by the President were
printed in a 7,000-word dispatch in
the government daily newspaper
Izvestia in the form of an inter
view by its editor, Alexei Adzhu
bei, son in-law of Premier Nikita
Khrushchev.
Adzhubei talked with Kennedy
last Saturday at Hyannis Port,
Mass. The textual account in Iz
vestia yesterday disclosed that Ad
zhubei disagreed and argued with
Kennedy and did about half as
much talking as the President.
KENNEDY said there was no
military power in the world which
could invade the Soviet Union.
Turning to the specifics of the
Berlin problem, the President
said:
“All we want is to maintain
limited, and numerically very lim
ited, forces of the three powers in
West Berlin and have, for exam
ple, an international administra
tion for the highway so that goods
and people could go back and forth
without hindrance.”
Later he told Adzhubei:

“I think we can preserve peace
in this century in Central Europe
if we can reach an agreement on
West Berlin.”

The unprecedented dispatch ap
peared on the front page of Iz
vestia, which is printed simul
taneously in cities across Russia.
In Moscow, as always, it was
quickly bought out at the news
stands. It carried a headline ‘‘ln
terview of the President of the
United States . . and then went

into a chronological account of the
conversation.
The President did some very
frank talking. Among other
things, he said:
• DIFFERENCES between the
two great world powers “arise
as result of the efforts of the Sovi
et Union in a certain sense to com
munize the whole world.”
• “If ihe Soviet Union pursues
only its own national interests and
tries to secure a better life for its
people in conditions of peace, then
. . . there would be nothing which
could darken the relations between
the Soviet Union and the United
States.”
• “We were still sitting around
a table in Geneva in August when,
during the nuclear test ban talks,
the Soviet Union resumed the
tests, preparations lor which must
gone on for several months at the
time when negotiations were in
progress.”
• THE CASTRO revolution was
in the beginning supported by
a vast majority of the Cuban peo
ple. But Castro went back on his
word to hold free elections. It can
not, therefore, claim to represent
the people and such is the Ameri
can dispute with Cuba.
• The United States will recog
nize and accept it if any nation
freely elects a Communist sys
tem. “What we object to and what

we consider a threat to peace is the
imposition of a system by a small
militant group by means of sub
version, penetration and so on.”
• “WE CONSIDER that to di
vide a country, to divide a city, to
erect a wall in a city, only in
creases tensions. It does not de
crease it.”

• If he, Kennedy, were a Soviet
war veteran, he would not worry
about a military move by West
Germany since that nation has
only nine divisions, no nuclear
weapons, an insignificant air force
and almost no navy.

MOSCOW (UPI) President
Kennedy told the Russian people
yesterday there can be “peace in
this century” if the Berlin ques
tion is solved, and he proposed
internationalization of the high
way lifeline leading from the city
to West Germany.
Kennedy said that if the Soviet
Union would stick to its own na
tional interests and stop trying to
communize the world, one of the
great threats to American-Soviet
relations would be removed.

The blunt but not unfriendly
words by the President were
printed in a 7,000-word dispatch in
the government daily newspaper
Izvestia in the form of an inter
view by its editor, Alexei Adzhu
bei, son in-law of Premier Nikita
Khrushchev.
Adzhubei talked with Kennedy
last Saturday at Hyannis Port,
Mass. The textual account in Iz
vestia yesterday disclosed that Ad
zhubei disagreed and argued with
Kennedy and did about half as
much talking as the President.
KENNEDY said there was no
military power in the world which
could invade the Soviet Union.
Turning to the specifics of the
Berlin problem, the President
said:
“All we want is to maintain
limited, and numerically very lim
ited, forces of the three powers in
West Berlin and have, for exam
ple, an international administra
tion for the highway so that goods
and people could go back and forth
without hindrance.”
Later he told Adzhubei:

“I think we can preserve peace
in this century in Central Europe
if we can reach an agreement on
West Berlin.”

The unprecedented dispatch ap
peared on the front page of Iz
vestia, which is printed simul
taneously in cities across Russia.
In Moscow, as always, it was
quickly bought out at the news
stands. It carried a headline ‘‘ln
terview of the President of the
United States . . and then went

into a chronological account of the
conversation.
The President did some very
frank talking. Among other
things, he said:
• DIFFERENCES between the
two great world powers “arise
as result of the efforts of the Sovi
et Union in a certain sense to com
munize the whole world.”
• “If ihe Soviet Union pursues
only its own national interests and
tries to secure a better life for its
people in conditions of peace, then
. . . there would be nothing which
could darken the relations between
the Soviet Union and the United
States.”
• “We were still sitting around
a table in Geneva in August when,
during the nuclear test ban talks,
the Soviet Union resumed the
tests, preparations lor which must
gone on for several months at the
time when negotiations were in
progress.”
• THE CASTRO revolution was
in the beginning supported by
a vast majority of the Cuban peo
ple. But Castro went back on his
word to hold free elections. It can
not, therefore, claim to represent
the people and such is the Ameri
can dispute with Cuba.
