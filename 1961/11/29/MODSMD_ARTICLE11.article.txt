# Thomas To Speak On Right
## 
### 
Norman Thomas, six-time So
cialist candidate for President,
will speak on “The Military
Right” at 4:15 p.m. today in Cub
berlcy Auditorium.
Thomas, who is being spon
sored by the Socialist Caucus,
made the nation’s headlines with
in the past week by exposing the
manner in which the former com
mander of the Pensacola Naval
Air Station, Vice Admiral Dofert
Goldthwaite, indoctrinated his
men with the propaganda of the
John Birch Society.
Thomas maintains that Gold
thwaite conducted “a virtual one
man crusade for right-wing ex
tremeism from coast to coast.”
THOMAS, an ordained Presby
terian minister, is a graduate of
Princeton University and the re
cipient of an honorary Litt.D.
from that institution.
He studied at the Union Theo
logical and Princeton seminaries
and was ordained in 1911. For
seven years Thomas was pastor
of the East Harlem Church in the
heart of New York’s Italian slum
district. In 1918 he left the min
istry to devote himself to the
cause of democratic socialism.
Besides running for President
six times (receiving 900,000 votes
in 1932), Thomas has also cam
paigned twice for the mayorality
of New York, once for the gover
norship of New York and once
for state senator.
ALTHOUGH a considerable por -
tion of his reform program was
pre-empted by the New Deal,
Thomas remains disenchanted
with American life.
This year he wrote. “Our afflu
ent society exists like an island
in a sea of the world’s bitter—and
remediable poverty; within that
island arc pockets of inexcusable
poverty; its rewards are still de
termined too largely by breed
and greed, rather than need and
deed; and in its frantic prosecu
tion of the cold war we have not
found security, much less true
peace.”
