# Can the U.S Afford Senator Thurmonds?
## 
### 
The performance Monday afternoon of Sen. Strom Thurmond,
who calls himself a Democrat but who belongs with the right wing
of the Republican Party, would have wowed ’em in rural South
Carolina—if he had been speaking in rural South Carolina. Unfor
tunately, the Senator was addressing a university audience which
had a right to demand more than the disgusting, unintelligent spiel
directed toward them.
Even Stanford conservatives must have been somewhat embar
rassed by Thurmond’s diatribe, and his use of God and The Flag
to cover up a speech which for the most part was pure emotion.
For one thing, Thurmond seems unable to make the distinction
between legitimate education of U.S. fighting men in what this
country stands for and indoctrination of a partisan viewpoint in a
situation where the soldiers have no choice but to sit and listen.
We do not question the need to instill in the armed forces (and
civilians, too) an awareness of the principles the United States
stands for.
We do draw the line, however, when such educational programs
cross the border between partisanship and neutrality, as did Gen
eral Walker.
The military should keep out of politics—a basic tenet of Ameri
can government since our Revolution. This is especially true today,
when the military by both direct and indirect methods controls so
much of our life, particularly the economic part of it. As The Nation
magazine puts it, the U.S. is on the road to becoming a “Warfare
State.” Even Mr. Eisenhower, when he left office, pointed out the
danger of the military becoming too involved in American life.
Thus it is essential that politics be left to civilians and not the
misguided patriots in the military. If the people of the United States
want to develop a welfare state, a Socialist government or with
draw to Fortress America,” that is their privilege and they can do
so through the ballot box. The military men who object to this may
fight it—through the ballot box. But they should keep their troop
educational programs non-partisan, for they wield too much power
over the minds of their subordinates to be allowed to expound a
conservative, liberal or any other partisan view.
Finally, one might hope that the time will come when men such
as Senator Thurmond do not walk the halls of Congress. Senators
are too powerful and their statements and actions too often are
accepted elsewhere as the concensus of U.S. opinion, for the coun
try to allow itself the luxury of demagogic, irrational men in the
government, whether they espouse the views of left, right or center.

when the military by both direct and indirect methods controls so
much of our life, particularly the economic part of it. As The Nation
magazine puts it, the U.S. is on the road to becoming a “Warfare
State.” Even Mr. Eisenhower, when he left office, pointed out the
danger of the military becoming too involved in American life.
Thus it is essential that politics be left to civilians and not the
misguided patriots in the military. If the people of the United States
want to develop a welfare state, a Socialist government or with
draw to Fortress America,” that is their privilege and they can do
so through the ballot box. The military men who object to this may
fight it—through the ballot box. But they should keep their troop
educational programs non-partisan, for they wield too much power
over the minds of their subordinates to be allowed to expound a
conservative, liberal or any other partisan view.
Finally, one might hope that the time will come when men such
as Senator Thurmond do not walk the halls of Congress. Senators
are too powerful and their statements and actions too often are
accepted elsewhere as the concensus of U.S. opinion, for the coun
try to allow itself the luxury of demagogic, irrational men in the
government, whether they espouse the views of left, right or center.
The performance Monday afternoon of Sen. Strom Thurmond,
who calls himself a Democrat but who belongs with the right wing
of the Republican Party, would have wowed ’em in rural South
Carolina—if he had been speaking in rural South Carolina. Unfor
tunately, the Senator was addressing a university audience which
had a right to demand more than the disgusting, unintelligent spiel
directed toward them.
Even Stanford conservatives must have been somewhat embar
rassed by Thurmond’s diatribe, and his use of God and The Flag
to cover up a speech which for the most part was pure emotion.
For one thing, Thurmond seems unable to make the distinction
between legitimate education of U.S. fighting men in what this
country stands for and indoctrination of a partisan viewpoint in a
situation where the soldiers have no choice but to sit and listen.
We do not question the need to instill in the armed forces (and
civilians, too) an awareness of the principles the United States
stands for.
We do draw the line, however, when such educational programs
cross the border between partisanship and neutrality, as did Gen
eral Walker.
The military should keep out of politics—a basic tenet of Ameri
can government since our Revolution. This is especially true today,
when the military by both direct and indirect methods controls so
much of our life, particularly the economic part of it. As The Nation
