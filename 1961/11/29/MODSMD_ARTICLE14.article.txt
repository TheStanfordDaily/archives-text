tional Voluntary Service first

The Peace Corps perhaps by de
fault. is the most controversial of
the innovations on the New Fron
tier. In fact, when one considers
all the contradictory claims and
charges made for and against the
Peace Corps it seems that this con
troversiality is its most notable
characteristic.
Few are totally opposed to the
idea, at least in public, but on the
other hand few are able to come to
terms with President Kennedy’s
conception of the program as an
humanitarian opportunity to help
“build growing and independent
nations where men can live in dig
nity, liberaled from the bonds of
hunger, ignorance and poverty.”
A great number have seen the
President’s proposal in a different
light. The Peace Corps has been
exposed or hailed as a propaganda
weapon or welcomed as an alter
native to the draft, and though
there was dissent as to whose God
should go, various church groups
rejoiced that Washington had fi
nally recognized the need for Him
in the underdeveloped countries.
On the lunatic fringe, there is even
a feeling that here at last is the
perfect facade for an invasion of
our agitators, the Young Ameri
cans for Clumsiness, you might
say.
THUS WE SEE that a great
many are in favor of the Peace
Corps, but for a wide variety of
reasons, some of which are ques
tionable to say the least. Implicit
in much of this confusion is the
belief that no idealistic cause can
act successfully in the cold war.
The program has been compared
to the Children’s Crusade of the
early twelfth century, when thou
sands of children started off for
the Holy Land, like lambs to the
slaughter. In short, the Peace
Corps is too good to be believed in.

It is not generally known, how
ever, that a similar program, the
prototype for the Peace Corps, has
been operating since 1952. The In
ternational Voluntary Service is
one of the many government-af
filiated voluntary agencies fi
nanced in part by the government
and in part by private contribu
tions.

Young teams of carefully select
ed Americans, normally college
graduates with a specific skill, are
sent overseas for two year periods.
For their service they receive $6O
per month, $l5 less than their
Peace Corps counterparts. Nine
countries have benefitted since the
inception of the program, includ
ing Colombia, Egypt, South Viet-
Nam, Cambodia and Laos.
THE EIGHT-MAN team in Laos
helping to establish a university in
Vientiane includes an agronomist,
a masonry technician, and biology,
home economics and English
teachers. Despite unfavorable con
ditions (they were caught between
Kong Le’s howitzers and the city
during the seige of Vientiane) mo
rale is exceptionally high, a con
dition underscored by the great in
terest in the local language.
Every member of the team has
achieved some fluency in Lao, a
difficult language for Westerners.
Each individual appeared to be
lieve in the worth and success of
the project and to derive a feeling
of groat personal satisfaction
from this. The Americans are well
liked by the students and faculty
with whom they work, and finally,
but not least, there is now a uni
versity in Laos.

Here, then, is a group acting on
humanitarian principles—success
fully—just as Sargent Shriver en
visions the Peace Corps. Other
IVS groups have had equal good
fortune, IVS gets neither the train
ing nor the glory the Peace Corps
receives and yet is a stable, heart
ening example of what this typo
of aid can accomplish. Because of
its success and its idealism, the
Peace Corps-IVS concept deserves
to be recognized for what it actu
ally is—a truly striking innovation
in the often messy business of for
eign assistance.
