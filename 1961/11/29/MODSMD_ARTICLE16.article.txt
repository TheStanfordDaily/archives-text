## U.S. Agriculture Battles Reds 
### GAYLORD P. GODWIN 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Agri
culture Secretary Orville L. Free
man used a mighty muscle in
throwing a punch at communism
after his recent month-long trip
around the world.
That muscle is the tremendous
production capacity of the Ameri
can farmer, and U. S. agriculture
as a whole.

This production capacity,
coupled with American generosity
in feeding hungry peoples, just
could convince some unaligned na
tions that it is far better to be fed
than Red.

FURTHERMORE, it could be
the direct cause of tremendous eco
nomic growth in the United States.
It could expand world trade' to
such an extent that participating
countries also would show extra
ordinary growth.
Freeman, after visiting a dozen
countries in Europe, the Middle
East and Southeast Asia, returned
with a feeling of thankfulness for
the productivity of American agri
culture.

“The greatest single source of
strength in the struggle to insure
that freedom prevails around the
world,” Freeman told a news con
ference, “is the success of Ameri
can agriculture and the American
farmer.

“IT IS the strongest deterrent to
the spread of communism because
the contrast between American
agriculture and that of the Com
munists is apparent to the whole
world.”

Freeman said the failure and in
efficiency of Soviet agriculture
and the collapse of the commune
agriculture in Red China “is an
ever present symbol of the differ
ence between democracy and
communism.”

This was a point Freeman at
tempted to bring to nations where
farming is the primary occupation
for GO to 80 pei 1 cent of the people.
He is trying to make the same
point to Americans in his fight to
raise American farm income.
He told audiences around the
world that while the United States
was sending a team of agricul

tural experts to analyze the needs
of developing nations, “the Soviet
Union was spewing radioactive
poison into the atmosphere.” He
reminded the peoples of other
countries, too, that the United
States had made $9 billion worth
of food and fiber available to de
veloping countries.
A SOLID clincher in his argu
ment for American agriculture
was the fact that family owned
and operated farms in the United
States make it possible for one
farmer to feed 23 Americans and
three other persons elsewhere in
the world. This stands in sharp
contrast with the problems of So
viet agriculture whore one farmer
can feed only six persons, and
where 45 per cent of the labor
force is needed in farming.

Russian announcements and un
announced intelligence reports
show that the Soviet Union has
plenty of nuclear might. But it
makes no boasts on agricultural
productivity. Other intelligence re
ports indicate they are frightened
of tlie U.S. capacity to produce
food.

of food and fiber available to de

A SOLID clincher in his argu
ment for American agriculture
was the fact that family owned
and operated farms in the United
States make it possible for one
farmer to feed 23 Americans and
three other persons elsewhere in
the world. This stands in sharp
contrast with the problems of So
viet agriculture whore one farmer
can feed only six persons, and
where 45 per cent of the labor
force is needed in farming.

Russian announcements and un
announced intelligence reports
show that the Soviet Union has
plenty of nuclear might. But it
makes no boasts on agricultural
productivity. Other intelligence re

WASHINGTON (UPI) Agri
culture Secretary Orville L. Free
man used a mighty muscle in
throwing a punch at communism
after his recent month-long trip
around the world.
That muscle is the tremendous
production capacity of the Ameri
can farmer, and U. S. agriculture
as a whole.

This production capacity,
coupled with American generosity
in feeding hungry peoples, just
could convince some unaligned na
tions that it is far better to be fed
than Red.

FURTHERMORE, it could be
the direct cause of tremendous eco
nomic growth in the United States.
It could expand world trade' to
such an extent that participating
countries also would show extra
ordinary growth.
Freeman, after visiting a dozen
countries in Europe, the Middle
East and Southeast Asia, returned
with a feeling of thankfulness for
the productivity of American agri
culture.

“The greatest single source of
strength in the struggle to insure
that freedom prevails around the
world,” Freeman told a news con
ference, “is the success of Ameri
can agriculture and the American
farmer.

“IT IS the strongest deterrent to
the spread of communism because
the contrast between American
agriculture and that of the Com
munists is apparent to the whole
world.”

Freeman said the failure and in
efficiency of Soviet agriculture
and the collapse of the commune
agriculture in Red China “is an
ever present symbol of the differ
ence between democracy and
communism.”

This was a point Freeman at
tempted to bring to nations where
farming is the primary occupation
for GO to 80 pei 1 cent of the people.
He is trying to make the same
point to Americans in his fight to
raise American farm income.
He told audiences around the
world that while the United States
was sending a team of agricul

tural experts to analyze the needs
of developing nations, “the Soviet
Union was spewing radioactive
poison into the atmosphere.” He
reminded the peoples of other
