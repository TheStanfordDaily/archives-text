### 
WASHINGTON (UPH Presi
dent Kennedy said yesterday the
Moscow publication of his inter
view - personally approved by
Premier Nikita Khrushchev—was
"a marked step forward in Amer
ican-Soviet understanding.”

He added that “I hope it will
lead to further intensification of
free communication between our
two countries at all levels.”

The President issued the state
ment after hearing from the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow that the full
text of his precedent-breaking in
terview' with Soviet politician-edi
tor Alexei Adzhubei had been pub
lished in the Soviet government
newspaper Izvestia.

IT WAS LEARNED yesterday
that negotiations to improve
American-Soviet public communi
cations were underway for five
months before agreement was
reached for Adzhubei— Izvestla’s
editor and Khrushchev’s son-in
law—to meet with Kennedy at Hy
annis Port, Mass., last Saturday.
The negotiations were conduct
ed with Kennedy’s approval by
White House Press Secretary
Pierre Salinger, who initiated the
idea with top Russian press of
ficials.

He told them that Khrushchev
had spread his views to the U.S.
public by granting interviews to
American journalists, but that no
U.S. president had been able to
communicate his ideas in the same
way to the Russian public.
INVOLVED in the talks with
Salinger were Ad/hubei and Mik
hail Kharlamov, chief press offi
cer for the Soviet Foreign Office,
both of w’hom were here last June
for a television debate with the
White House press chief.

Another Russian participant
was Georgi Bolshikov, Washing
ton-based editor of USSR, an Eng
lish-language magazine distribut
ed in this country.
Last Sept. 29, Bolshikov con
tacted Salinger and told him
Khrushchev himself had taken
personal note of Salinger’s propos
al for an interview and felt it
would be a good idea for Kennedy
to have a chance to speak to the
Russian people through Izvestia.

Adzhubei, Russia’s best-known
journalist, was picked to do the
job.
