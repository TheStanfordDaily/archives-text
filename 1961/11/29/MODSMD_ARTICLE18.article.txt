# BERLIN REPORT
## Work in East Germany And Passive Resistance 
### STEVE FREIDBERG WIL KOHL 
(EDITOR’S NOTE; Tills is the
second of three articles from two
Stanford graduates now studying
in Berlin. The articles are based
primarily on interviews with a re
cent refugee from East Berlin.
Steve Freidberg, a former Daily
editor, is tills year’s exchange stu
dent at the Free University of Ber
lin. Wil Kohl, a former HR vice
president, is studying at the Free
University on a West German
government grant. Both are mem
bers of the Class of ’6l).

BERLIN—In the Soviet system
almost all aspects of life are of a
political nature and are therefore
subject to the political control of
the state. Work is one such aspect
of life; it is not only considered to
bo a right and a means of personal
sustainment but also a political
“duty and a matter of honor for
every able-bodied citizen.”
As a Communist state East Ger
many proclaims work to be the
duty of all. Theoretically the citi
zen can still choose his job, but
this right is whittled away by a
law empowering the state to re
move a person from his work and
reassign him elsewhere where
there is an urgent need for a peri
od of four weeks, or in a condition
of emergency even longer. This
year such a condition of emergen
cy exists, and the call is for people
to work on the farms, a job which
is among the most meagerly paid.
If the worker does not go willingly
he can be called before a court.
The East German factory is of
course owned and run by the state.
In most factories the director and
the top administration are Com
munists and gel their jobs through
the Party. Appointments are made
from political considerations and
not from the point of view of tech
nical skill. Thus, the best Commu
nists get the best jobs, whereas
the lower employes are mostly
non-Party members and non-sym
pathetic to the regime. Work is or
ganized on the quota system.
Those workers who have reached
or surpassed their quota are term
ed “Aktivisten’’ and receive a bo
nus or premium.
THE FREIE DEUTSC HE Ge
werkschafts Bund, the only labor
union, operates from the interests
of the state and the party. This
union fights for longer working
hours instead of for more leisure
time. The individual factory direc
tors decide whether their em
ployes are to be compelled to join
the union. When the director is not
a Communist, then practically no
one belongs. The union does offer
apparently cheap possibilities of
recreation and vacation trips.
However, this appearance is de
ceiving, for by the time one has
worked long enough to earn the
cost of such a trip the cost of his
union dues adds up to almost the
equal amount.
According to Klaus’ account, it
is in the factory that the popula
tion has its best opportunity to ex
press itself against the regime and
to hinder the advancement of Com
munism. For some time (even be
fore the 13th of August) many
workers have participated in some
form of passive resistance, even
up to the level of the technical di
rector. This resistance can take
many forms.

For example, Klaus was compel
led to work in an office of an elec
trical plant. In this plant work be
gan at 7 a.m., but he and his fellow
workers did nothing but talk
among themselves untilB:3o, when
it was time for the breakfast
break. Often an hour recess was
taken instead of the half-hour pre
scribed. From 9 until 12 Klaus and
his co-workers did as little as pos
sible: Klaus narrated that he often
went for a walk. After the noon
break some work was done, but
all in a deliberately sluggish fash
ion and with little desire.
SUCH PASSIVE resistance
varies, of course, from factory to
factory. Klaus explained that in
his plant the administration was
aware of the slowing-up of the
work and complained to the em
ployes. But due to the shortage of
workers, a problem which increas
ed sharply with the flow of East

Germans to the West before Aug.
13, the plant directors could do
little about it.

Other examples of passive re
sistance in factories indicate the
potential of this form of expres
sion against the Ulbricht regime.
Workers often order building
parts from the West, because they
know they won’t be delivered on
time. Often parts and supplies are
ordered when they are not needed
at all, as was the case on two dif
ferent occasions with 25 tons of
plaster in Klaus’ factory which
were unloaded outside and after
several days were ruined by the
rain. No one knew who ordered
the plaster or why.
Often railway cars disappear
from trains. Factory doctors give
workers sick certificates when
they are well, thus adding to the
shortage of man-power.
KLAUS EMPHASIZED that pas
sive resistance is done only on an
individual level. It is not an or
ganized movement, as this would
be too dangerous. In Klaus’ office
the employes often spoke about
ways of hindering production, but
this is not true of all such working
groups. There is much suspicion;
workers have to know each other
very well before resistance is op
enly discussed. More often resist
ance is effected individually and
not mentioned to one’s fellow
workers.

According to Klaus, this passive
resistance will remain in East
Germany, but the chances for any
highly organized resistance or rev
olution are very remote. The peo
ple of East Germany have learned
from the failures of revolutions in
Poland and Hungary and from
their own abortive attempt of June
17, 1953. They know that in the
face of Soviet tanks they have no
chance. The Russians are too
strong, and the East Germans ex
pect little help from the West.
The lack of Western resistance
to the erection of Ulbricht’s wall in
Berlin on Aug. 13 was a great mor
al setback and did much to
strengthen the latter conviction.
There remains a vague, far-flung
hope for the reunification of Ger
many, but there is now very little
belief that it will ever come.
