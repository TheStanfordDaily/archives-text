### THURMOND SPEECH Editor, The Daily 
The people who missed hearing
Strom Thurmond speak in Memo
rial Auditorium (Monday) after
noon missed one of the marvels of
civilized society. They missed
hearing a United States senator
speaking before a supposed intel
lectual community in an hour-long
diatribe against the principles of
his own political party as well as
assorted emotional appeals to God
and to “the good people, the con
servative people, the solid Ameri
can people.’’
His speech ranged from praise
of Edwin Walker, Brig. Gen. USA
Ret., as a great American to ridi
culing Harvard and Oxford for be
ing prototypes of liberal arts in
stitutions. It was the type of
speech one normally associates
with a backwoods demagogue like
Huey Long and was a rare oppor
tunity to see at first hand what
one U.S. senator is made of.

Most demagogues have the in
telligence to gear their speech to
their audience. Senator Thurmond
apparently does not. He, near the
beginning of his talk, got from che
audience scattered applause with
one flag-waving reference to
America and from this gathered
that the audience would welcome
any sort of attack on left wingers
or liberals as long as it was
coupled with some sort of super
patriotic statement.

Some of the audience did like it
and therefore perhaps the Senator
did not over-estimate them. He
criticized practically everything
to the left of Goldwater except
social security although he did say
that he had more to say but
couldn’t because of lack of time.
He did say that those who didn’t
like our typo of government should
leave the country, not to include,
I assume men like Robert Welch
or E. Walker.

I urge that The Daily reprint
his speech in full for the benefit
of those who missed him,

SUNDAY FLICKS
Editor, The Daily:
To the members of the audience
of “General della Rovere”;
I am thankful to the people of
the United States for my presence
here. However, I am certain that
some of you do not know what this
gratitude is for and for what rea
sons it is being expressed. It is not
expected of you.
All I wish to say is that you who
could laugh at the horrors of war,
the degeneration of morals, the
destitution of the human spirit, by

your laughter have shown your
self capable of the same deeds and
worse. This is not an accusation;
it is a request to examine the pos
sibilities.
•I. M. Svendsen
