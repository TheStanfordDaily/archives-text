# Tryouts Held For New Play
## 
### 
The last open tryouts will be
held at 7:30 p.m. for the Stan
ford Players’ production of “Six
Characters in Search of an
Author.”

Tryouts for the Luigi Piran
dello modern tragic-comedy are in
Room 205, Memorial Auditorium.
There are parts available for 12
men and 10 women.
The play, directed by Michael
Addison, will bo produced in the
Little Theatre on Jan. 24, 25, 26,
27 and 31 and Feb. 1, 2 and 3.
It will also tour to the University
of California at Davis on Feb. 4.
The play tells of a rehearsal
that is in progress and is inter
rupted by the appearance of six
characters who claim to come
from an author’s imagination.
The author’s refusal to complete
their life motivates them to seek
the opportunity to re-enact it on
a stage.
The six characters convince the
director that their life is dra
matic, and, to his consternation,
take over the theater. Their story
unfolds and the action passes
from a comic conflict between
the acting company and the six
characters to a tragic revelation
of the nature of their eternal tor
ment.
