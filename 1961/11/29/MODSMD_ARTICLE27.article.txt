# Dallmar Promises Good Team For Indian Basketball Fans
## 
### THOMAS PARKER 
“We should have a pretty good
team this year,” were the words of
varsity basketball coach Howard
Dallmar. This is not entirely an
unfounded statement. The basket
ball mentor went on to give a run
flown of the loading courtmen on
campus.
The battle for the center slot is
still on as the first game of the sea
son looms closer. Both Mike Ledg
erwood and Tom Dose have their
eyes on starting in the center cir
cle on Saturday when the Cards
face USF.
LEDGERWOOD. last year’s
starting center and a senior, is (5-7
and hails from Portland, Oregon.
He has lost weight since last year
and has improved considerably.
Dose stands 6-8, has tremen
dous potential and a good shoot
ing touch. He started as center on
last year’s Frosh five.
The forward position is also un
decided. John Windsor, one of last
year’s starting five, returns with
a 13.58 scoring average, leading
last year’s varsity. Phil Kelly, one
of last year’s most valuable re
serves might also see starting ac
tion Saturday. Kelly, 6-2, averaged
six points a game last year. Hollis
Moore, a fine aggressive sopho
more is another comer who might
start.
JLM BRYAN, Bob Sommers, and
Bill Elfving are giving Windsor,
Kelly and Moore a real run for
their money and securing a slot
will really be difficult at the for
ward position.
Doug and Don Clemetsen, junior
twins who both have seen a good
deal of varsity action, and Darrell
Sutherland highlight the guard

position. The Clemetsen twins are
fundamentally sound players.
Sutherland, who pitched for the
Stanford Varsity baseball squad,
Is an excellent shooter.
Competition for this position
will be found in Lew Shupe, Fred
Pegelow, John Pontius and Chris
Babbs.
DALLMAR HAD his squad run
ning cross-country the first part
of the season for conditioning. He
now feels that the team is farther
along than it was last year. The
Tribe has three starters coming
back, along with 12 other return

ing players. He also places a good
deal of faith on the recruits from
Ihe tw’o previous frosh squads,
“the best two frosh squads Stan
ford has ever had. hack to back."
Last night’s scrimmage should
decide the starting lineup for the
opener, but with the depth of the
squad, Dallmar feels that these
positions could change during the
season.
This year’s team will go on an
eight-day trip to Hawaii for games
with all-star servicemen’s teams,
an addition to their regular 24-
game schedule.

DALLMAR HAD his squad run
ning cross-country the first part
of the season for conditioning. He
now feels that the team is farther
along than it was last year. The
Tribe has three starters coming
back, along with 12 other return

ing players. He also places a good
deal of faith on the recruits from
Ihe tw’o previous frosh squads,
“the best two frosh squads Stan
ford has ever had. hack to back."
Last night’s scrimmage should
decide the starting lineup for the
opener, but with the depth of the
squad, Dallmar feels that these
positions could change during the
season.
This year’s team will go on an
eight-day trip to Hawaii for games
with all-star servicemen’s teams,
an addition to their regular 24-
game schedule.
“We should have a pretty good
team this year,” were the words of
varsity basketball coach Howard
Dallmar. This is not entirely an
unfounded statement. The basket
ball mentor went on to give a run
flown of the loading courtmen on
campus.
The battle for the center slot is
still on as the first game of the sea
son looms closer. Both Mike Ledg
erwood and Tom Dose have their
eyes on starting in the center cir
cle on Saturday when the Cards
face USF.
LEDGERWOOD. last year’s
starting center and a senior, is (5-7
and hails from Portland, Oregon.
He has lost weight since last year
and has improved considerably.
Dose stands 6-8, has tremen
dous potential and a good shoot
ing touch. He started as center on
last year’s Frosh five.
The forward position is also un
decided. John Windsor, one of last
year’s starting five, returns with
a 13.58 scoring average, leading
last year’s varsity. Phil Kelly, one
of last year’s most valuable re
serves might also see starting ac
tion Saturday. Kelly, 6-2, averaged
six points a game last year. Hollis
Moore, a fine aggressive sopho
more is another comer who might
start.
JLM BRYAN, Bob Sommers, and
Bill Elfving are giving Windsor,
Kelly and Moore a real run for
their money and securing a slot
will really be difficult at the for
ward position.
Doug and Don Clemetsen, junior
twins who both have seen a good
deal of varsity action, and Darrell
Sutherland highlight the guard

position. The Clemetsen twins are
fundamentally sound players.
Sutherland, who pitched for the
Stanford Varsity baseball squad,
Is an excellent shooter.
Competition for this position
will be found in Lew Shupe, Fred
Pegelow, John Pontius and Chris
Babbs.
