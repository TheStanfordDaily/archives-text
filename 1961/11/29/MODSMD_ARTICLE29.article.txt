St. Mary’s: The Gaels face a
tough year with big Tom Mes

has a small quintet with forwards
Hamilton Holmes and Steve Gray
being his biggest men at 6-4. But

Eddie Thomas because of grades
and Jack Galten, their regular
center, who is ill. “It will be
kind of tough this season,” Pe

Santa Clara: It should be a

St. Mary’s: The Gaels face a
tough year with big Tom Mes
chery gone. Coach Jim Weaver
has a small quintet with forwards
Hamilton Holmes and Steve Gray
being his biggest men at 6-4. But
he thinks that the Gaels will have
speed and could surprise some of
the bigger outfits.
University of San Francisco:
Bob Gaillard, a fine shooting
guard, is a main cog in coach
Pete Peletta’s aggregation. Pelet
ta claims that Gaillard. a senior,
could rival the Dons’ K.C. Jones
as an all-time great. But they lost
Eddie Thomas because of grades
and Jack Galten, their regular
center, who is ill. “It will be
kind of tough this season,” Pe
letta says.

“We have more depth and we
lost only one forward —Tony Ry
an,” Arndt says. “Ed Bento, our
all-league center, is back along
with forward Tony Krallman and
guards Jerry Grote and Brian

poses the biggest threat. They
had all sophomores last season.”
