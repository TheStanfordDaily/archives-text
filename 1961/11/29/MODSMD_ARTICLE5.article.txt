# JFK Wants More Troops
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD Presi
dent Kennedy has decided to ask
Congress for two more standing
Army combat divisions, it was re
ported yesterday. This would pro
duce a permanent force of close
to a million men.

It was said that Kennedy and
Defense Secretary Robert S. Mc-
Namara reached the decision dur
ing their weekend conference at
Hyannis Port, Mass.
McNamara made a similar indi
cation earlier this month when he
told reporters he thought the
Army should got more additional
men than ihe 929,000 called for in
previous budget plans, in view of
the Berlin crisis.

The Army already is building
toward a strength of 1,008,000 men
in 16 divisions. But more than 100.-
000 of the troops are reservists and
National Guardsmen scheduled
for demobilization next year.

Mantaining the 16 - division
strength would require substitu
tion of regular Army units for the
two National Guard divisions now
active Wisconsin’s 32nd Infantry
and the 49th Armored from Texas.
Before the Berlin crisis broke,
the Army stoutly insisted that a
strength of 925,000 men was need
ed to maintain 14 combat divisions
and the essential supporting units
required in modern warfare.

Bui defense and Army officials
now agree that 16 divisions cannot
be maintained in a state of full
combat readiness with much less
than a million men.
