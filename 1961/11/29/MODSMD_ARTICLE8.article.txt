# Soviet Nuclear Plan Called 'Propaganda'
## 
### 
GENEVA (UPD— The United
States yesterday denounced Rus
sia’s plan for an uncontrolled nu
clear test ban as a move to “de
ceive world public opinion” and
to make it impossible for the
West to conduct tests despite the
recent massive Soviet nuclear
blast series.

U.S. chief nuclear negotiator
Arthur Dean said Russia’s motto
seems to be; “Let’s all join atom
ics anonymous until the Soviet
Union wants to fall off the no
test wagon and test again.”
Doan spoke to the three-power
Genova nuclear test ban confer
ence that resumed yesterday
afternoon after a three-week re
cess. In a “tactical” session before
(he conference, the U.S. and Brit
ish delegates agreed to turn down
Russia’s new plan.
The U.S. delegation chief blast
ed the Soviet plan as an “una
shamed propaganda move” and
“a clear indication the Soviet Un
ion does not want a test ban
treaty.”
After clashing head-on at the
conference session, both Dean
and Soviet chief negotiator Sem
yon K. Tsarapkin told newsmen
there was now nothing to nego
tiate.
Dean said t lie Soviet plan was
being forwarded to Washington
but the Russians had been told
at the conference table that the
West “found this completely, to
tally and absolutely unsatisfac
tory and unacceptable.”
Dean gave the American reply
after Tsarapkin formally read to
the meeting Moscow’s four-point
plan calling for an uncontrolled,
indefinite moratorium on nuclear
tests.
