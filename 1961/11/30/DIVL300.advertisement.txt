Must tomorrow's travelers resort to howdahs and
camel litters in order to get about? Not so, say
our Ford Motor Company scientists.
First—aside from the unlikely depletion of our
natural sources of gasoline—the prospects for
higher-efficiency internal combustion engines
are excellent.
Second, while gasoline still appears the best con
ceivable automotive fuel, our scientists are study
ing the outlook for new energy sources for cars.
Among intriguing possibilities: new energy con
version systems using degraded fuels, or fuels
synthesized from low-cost power produced by
nuclear fusion. Magneto-hydrodynamic gener
ators and solid-state thermoelectric and electro
chemical converters offer other possibilities.
This is all part of a broad quest for fundamental
knowledge, earning Ford its place of leadership
through scientific research and engineering.
