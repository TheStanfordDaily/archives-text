# 'Arms Race Leads, To Garrison State, Says Socialist
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ 
“It is up to this generation to
find an alternative to war,” an ar
thritic but still arm-waving Nor
man Thomas told a packed Cub
berley audience yesterday after
noon.

Socialist Thomas, six times can
didate for president continued,
“We cannot support the arms race
as it is presently and keep our free
dom. We are well on our way to a
garrison state, that is, a state
where the military is dominant.”

FOLLOWING S E NATO R J.
Strom Thurmond’s address
against “muzzling the military"
by just two days, Thomas chose to
answer the conservative directly.
In reference to Birch-supporting
General Walker (defended by
Thurmond) Thomas stated, “We
don’t object to their being fanatics.
We object to their being in a po
sition to inflict their fanaticism
on others.”
The whole arms race and in

creased power of the military, felt
the Socialist Party leader, reflects
an approach to Communism doom
ed to defeat us. “Is it conserva
tism to use the same methods as
those we think we are against?
Will increasing the FBI, the mili
tary, the Birch societies, spying on
neighbors, and shelters save us?
“To triumph democracy over
Communism we must be able to
show that democratic institutions
respecting the Bill of Rights can
succeed economically. Calling any
welfare statism ‘tainted’ is giving
Communism credit where it isn’t
due.”
“Even Eisenhower learned
enough in eight years in the White
House to warn us against the mili
tary, industrial complex. The Gold
waters are anti-centralists who be
lieve in giving the military what
they want.
THOMAS FELT that while the
United States is able to “Waste
the money used in the arms race
and provide jobs while doing it,”
the military outlook has bound up
the futures of corporations in
keeping this race going, and thus
yielding an all out war wanted by
neither side.
“Old soldiers seldom die, but
wither into corporations.”
A four-step program was out
lined by Thomas to keep us from
the war that would destroy both
Soviet and American power “leav
ing Red China to fill the vacuum.”
• ON AN INTERNATIONAL
level, bring the function of the mil
itary down to one of policing;
• Begin on progressive disen
gagement;
• Strengthen the United Na
tions;
• “Recognize China is governed
by an efficient—if not lovable
government in Peiping, not by Chi
ang Kai-Shek, who is the repre
sentative of the Seventh American
Fleet.”
“Khrushchev has no more de
sire than Kennedy for war. He is
going to bury us politically, com
petitively. The way to keep con
querors from invading your coun
try isn’t by bombs that will de
stroy you both. If Kennedy would
come out and say we won’t test
any more bombs in Ihe air, other
nations wouldn’t either.
“This isn’t unilateral disarma
ment. It is more dangerous for us
militarily to have everyone test
ing.”
Thomas’ only concern with the
garrison state is not only econo
mic, but intellectual and ideologi
cal as well. “Patriotism becomes
aligned with the military. I be
lieve in patriotism, in nationalism
as opposed to imperialism, in de
centralization as opposed to cen
tralization. Look at the U-2 inci
dent, and the clumsy lying forced
upon Stevenson in the UN.
IN AN ADDRESS that brought
prolonged applause and an even
tual standing ovation from the
main floor, aisles, and balcony au
dience, the veteran political battler
concluded the session from a chair
on stage. He commented on his ap
proach of ridicule to the problem:
“It is appropriate to use justified
ridicule and justified criticism to
keep people from falling into
traps. Vested interests support the
Birchers financially to keep the
'people from occupying their
minds with matters touchier to
those concerned.
“We laugh so as not to weep.”

Thomas’ only concern with the
garrison state is not only econo

SOCIALIST PARTY LEADER Norman Thomas addresses capacity audi
ence in Cubberley Auditorium on "The Military Right.”
“It is up to this generation to
find an alternative to war,” an ar
thritic but still arm-waving Nor
man Thomas told a packed Cub
berley audience yesterday after
noon.

Socialist Thomas, six times can
didate for president continued,
“We cannot support the arms race
as it is presently and keep our free
dom. We are well on our way to a
garrison state, that is, a state
where the military is dominant.”

FOLLOWING S E NATO R J.
Strom Thurmond’s address
against “muzzling the military"
by just two days, Thomas chose to
answer the conservative directly.
In reference to Birch-supporting
General Walker (defended by
Thurmond) Thomas stated, “We
don’t object to their being fanatics.
We object to their being in a po
sition to inflict their fanaticism
on others.”
The whole arms race and in

creased power of the military, felt
the Socialist Party leader, reflects
an approach to Communism doom
ed to defeat us. “Is it conserva
tism to use the same methods as
those we think we are against?
Will increasing the FBI, the mili
tary, the Birch societies, spying on
neighbors, and shelters save us?
“To triumph democracy over
Communism we must be able to
show that democratic institutions
respecting the Bill of Rights can
succeed economically. Calling any
welfare statism ‘tainted’ is giving
Communism credit where it isn’t
due.”
“Even Eisenhower learned
enough in eight years in the White
House to warn us against the mili
tary, industrial complex. The Gold
waters are anti-centralists who be
lieve in giving the military what
they want.
THOMAS FELT that while the
United States is able to “Waste
the money used in the arms race
and provide jobs while doing it,”
the military outlook has bound up
the futures of corporations in
keeping this race going, and thus
yielding an all out war wanted by
neither side.
“Old soldiers seldom die, but
wither into corporations.”
A four-step program was out
lined by Thomas to keep us from
the war that would destroy both
Soviet and American power “leav
ing Red China to fill the vacuum.”
• ON AN INTERNATIONAL
level, bring the function of the mil
itary down to one of policing;
• Begin on progressive disen
gagement;
• Strengthen the United Na
tions;
• “Recognize China is governed
by an efficient—if not lovable
government in Peiping, not by Chi
ang Kai-Shek, who is the repre
sentative of the Seventh American
Fleet.”
“Khrushchev has no more de
sire than Kennedy for war. He is
going to bury us politically, com
petitively. The way to keep con
querors from invading your coun
try isn’t by bombs that will de
stroy you both. If Kennedy would
come out and say we won’t test
any more bombs in Ihe air, other
nations wouldn’t either.

militarily to have everyone test

Birchers financially to keep the
