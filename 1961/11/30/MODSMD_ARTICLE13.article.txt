# BERLIN REPORT
## East German Churches Unified by Communists 
### STEVE FREIDBERG WIL KOHL 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
last of three articles written by
two Stanford graduates of the
Class of '6l who are now attending
the Free University of Berlin.

The articles have been based
chiefly on Interviews with a refu
gee who recently escaped from
East Germany and who has been
studying at the Free University.
His name has been changed to
Klaus in The Daily articles because
he still has relatives in East Ber
lin.)

BERLIN—The Church in East
Germany is the one remaining so
cial institution which has not been
thoroughly uprooted by the politi
cal oppression of the Ulbricht re
gime. Indeed the effect of Com
munism has been to draw the
many denominations, both Catho
lic and Protestant, together and to
strengthen the following of the
Church as a whole. This following,
however, has been weakened some
what by the flight of refugees to
the West.
In spite of the fact that the
Church stands in direct opposition
to Communism and hinders the re
gime in every way it can, Ulbricht
until very recently has allowed it
to continue its activities. How
ever, the Church awaits new and
harsher measures of control by
the State since the 13th of August.
Already there have been several
cases of priests being arrested.
The future of the Church in East
Germany is thus very uncertain.
Communism has had clear ef
fects upon East German educa
tion. Most teachers must be mem
bers of the Party. All students are
required to take a special course
dealing with Marxist-Leninist the
ory and the politics of the DDR
(Deutsche Demokratische Repub
lik). This course is taken over a
period of several years, and the
student’s success in it is an im
portant factor in his later admis
sion to the university.
THE STUDENTS in the East
German gymnasium (high school)
must work for one-half day a week
in the factory as part of their edu
cation. Aside from the educational
aspects of the requirement, this
part-time work serves as an im
portant man-power supplement.
Teachers also spend some time
each week in the factory. During
the summer vacations all students
must work for four weeks in the
harvest. An additional three
weeks is devoted to military train
ing with the Volksarmee.
Two youth organizations supple
ment the political education given
in the schools: the Young Pio
neers and the FDJ (Freie
Deutsche Jugend). The first group

accepts members of school age on
a voluntary basis. In many cases
where a student has a Communist
teacher, the whole class is often
induced to join.
The FDJ is for youth over 16
years of age. Pressure can be
brought to bear on parents to
make their children join, although
membership in the FDJ is also the
oretically voluntary. The parent
is told that his child won’t be able
to take the Ahitnr (the examina
tion at the end of high school
which is required for entrance in
to the university or for many jobs)
if he doesn’t become a member.
AN INTERESTING Commu
nist-initiated practice is the cere
mony of Jugendweihe. At age 14
all students who want to go on to
the Abitur are required to parti
cipate in this ceremony. Prepara
tion for it begins some time before
in the school with extra courses in
dialectical materialism, atheism,
etc. On a designated day the whole
school class formally assembles
and is addressed by a member of
the Party. Then each pupil is
called to the front of the room to
take an oath, whereby he prom
ises to live a life true to Commu
nism and the DDR. He then re
ceives an impressively-bound book
about man, the universe, and so
cialism.

The Catholic Church prohibits
this ceremony of Jugendweihe.
Some youth manage to avoid it,
particularly when a whole class re
fuses to accept it in mass protest.
However, Klaus estimated that 90
per cent of East German youth go
through this ceremony.
In the university the student’s
choice of a major field is still vol
untary, but his political record,
especially his grade in the high
school course on Marxism-Lenin
ism, is a very important factor in
determining whether he will be
accepted in the faculty he chooses.
University students of all fields
must also take an advanced course
in Marxist-Leninist theory. Both
male and female students must
also practice shooting during their
period of study, either in connec
tion with the university or with
the Gesellschaft fur Sport und
Technik, an organization formerly
designed to give technical training
which now is devoted to pre-mili
tary instruction.
ALL YOUTH BETWEEN the
ages of 18 and 24 are eligible for
duty in the Nationale Volksarmee.
Party members distribute forms
to those i n this age bracket—
whether students or factory work
ers—on which the subject must
first sign a statement declaring
that he is “for peace.” Then comes
a second statement explaining
that all those who are “for peace”
must also defend the peace. Thus,
the youth who has signed has de
clared that he is at any time will
ing to join the Volksarmee.
If a person resists signing this
form, he can be exmatriculated
from the university or receive a
poorer job, if he is a factory work
er. He usually declares his willing
ness to join the army, as he holds
this to be a better prospect.
Whereas the Volksarmee and
its auxiliary, the Kampfgruppen
(trained volunteer military groups
of factory workers), exist to de
fend the DDR against all external
enemies, a network of Party mem
bers guards against the internal
enemy and enforces the political
control of the regime upon its sub
jects.
According to Klaus, in each
large apartment house a member
of one of the Communist families
is named as the Hausvertraucns
mann. Ho is the Party representa
tive and has the duty of watching
all the families in the house and
reporting any suspicious activi
ties, such as going to Church. This
person reports, in turn, to a Stras
senvertrauensniann, and the lat
ter reports to a district coordinat
or under the control of the Volks
polizei. Meticulous files are ap
parently kept of suspicious activi
ties of all citizens.
DESPITE these awesome mea
sures, Klaus stated that the great
majority of the population of the
Soviet zone still remain very un
sympathetic to the regime. Indica
tive of this spirit was the warm
greeting given Klaus’ mother by
other families in their apartment
house after Klaus escaped to West
Berlin. One of Klaus’ bosses in the
factory where he worked even
paid a special visit to Klaus’
mother to congratulate her upon
her good fortune—that her son
had successfully escaped from
behind Ulbricht’s wall to freedom.

ALL YOUTH BETWEEN the
ages of 18 and 24 are eligible for
duty in the Nationale Volksarmee.
Party members distribute forms
to those i n this age bracket—
whether students or factory work
ers—on which the subject must
first sign a statement declaring
that he is “for peace.” Then comes
a second statement explaining
that all those who are “for peace”
must also defend the peace. Thus,
the youth who has signed has de
clared that he is at any time will
ing to join the Volksarmee.
If a person resists signing this
form, he can be exmatriculated
from the university or receive a
poorer job, if he is a factory work
er. He usually declares his willing
ness to join the army, as he holds
this to be a better prospect.
Whereas the Volksarmee and
its auxiliary, the Kampfgruppen
(trained volunteer military groups
of factory workers), exist to de
fend the DDR against all external
enemies, a network of Party mem
bers guards against the internal
enemy and enforces the political
control of the regime upon its sub

According to Klaus, in each
large apartment house a member
of one of the Communist families
is named as the Hausvertraucns
mann. Ho is the Party representa
tive and has the duty of watching
all the families in the house and
reporting any suspicious activi
ties, such as going to Church. This
person reports, in turn, to a Stras
senvertrauensniann, and the lat
ter reports to a district coordinat
or under the control of the Volks
polizei. Meticulous files are ap
parently kept of suspicious activi
ties of all citizens.
DESPITE these awesome mea
sures, Klaus stated that the great
majority of the population of the
Soviet zone still remain very un
sympathetic to the regime. Indica
tive of this spirit was the warm
greeting given Klaus’ mother by
other families in their apartment
house after Klaus escaped to West
Berlin. One of Klaus’ bosses in the
factory where he worked even
paid a special visit to Klaus’
mother to congratulate her upon
her good fortune—that her son
had successfully escaped from
behind Ulbricht’s wall to freedom.

BERLIN—The Church in East
Germany is the one remaining so
cial institution which has not been
thoroughly uprooted by the politi
cal oppression of the Ulbricht re
gime. Indeed the effect of Com
munism has been to draw the
many denominations, both Catho
lic and Protestant, together and to
strengthen the following of the
Church as a whole. This following,
however, has been weakened some
what by the flight of refugees to
the West.
In spite of the fact that the
Church stands in direct opposition
to Communism and hinders the re
gime in every way it can, Ulbricht
until very recently has allowed it
to continue its activities. How
ever, the Church awaits new and
harsher measures of control by
the State since the 13th of August.
Already there have been several
cases of priests being arrested.
The future of the Church in East
Germany is thus very uncertain.
Communism has had clear ef
fects upon East German educa
tion. Most teachers must be mem
bers of the Party. All students are
required to take a special course
dealing with Marxist-Leninist the
ory and the politics of the DDR
(Deutsche Demokratische Repub
lik). This course is taken over a
period of several years, and the
student’s success in it is an im
portant factor in his later admis
sion to the university.
THE STUDENTS in the East
German gymnasium (high school)
must work for one-half day a week
in the factory as part of their edu
cation. Aside from the educational
aspects of the requirement, this
part-time work serves as an im
portant man-power supplement.
Teachers also spend some time
each week in the factory. During
the summer vacations all students
must work for four weeks in the
harvest. An additional three
weeks is devoted to military train
ing with the Volksarmee.
Two youth organizations supple
ment the political education given
in the schools: the Young Pio
neers and the FDJ (Freie
Deutsche Jugend). The first group

accepts members of school age on
a voluntary basis. In many cases
where a student has a Communist
teacher, the whole class is often
induced to join.
The FDJ is for youth over 16
years of age. Pressure can be
brought to bear on parents to
make their children join, although
membership in the FDJ is also the
oretically voluntary. The parent
is told that his child won’t be able
to take the Ahitnr (the examina
tion at the end of high school
which is required for entrance in
to the university or for many jobs)
if he doesn’t become a member.
AN INTERESTING Commu
nist-initiated practice is the cere
mony of Jugendweihe. At age 14
all students who want to go on to
the Abitur are required to parti
cipate in this ceremony. Prepara
tion for it begins some time before
in the school with extra courses in
dialectical materialism, atheism,
etc. On a designated day the whole
school class formally assembles
and is addressed by a member of
the Party. Then each pupil is
called to the front of the room to
take an oath, whereby he prom
ises to live a life true to Commu
nism and the DDR. He then re
ceives an impressively-bound book
about man, the universe, and so
cialism.

The Catholic Church prohibits
this ceremony of Jugendweihe.
Some youth manage to avoid it,
particularly when a whole class re
fuses to accept it in mass protest.
However, Klaus estimated that 90
per cent of East German youth go
through this ceremony.
In the university the student’s
choice of a major field is still vol
untary, but his political record,
especially his grade in the high
school course on Marxism-Lenin
ism, is a very important factor in
determining whether he will be
accepted in the faculty he chooses.
University students of all fields
must also take an advanced course
in Marxist-Leninist theory. Both
male and female students must
also practice shooting during their
period of study, either in connec
tion with the university or with
the Gesellschaft fur Sport und
Technik, an organization formerly
designed to give technical training

portant man-power supplement.
Teachers also spend some time
each week in the factory. During
the summer vacations all students
must work for four weeks in the
harvest. An additional three
weeks is devoted to military train
ing with the Volksarmee.
Two youth organizations supple
ment the political education given
in the schools: the Young Pio
neers and the FDJ (Freie
Deutsche Jugend). The first group

accepts members of school age on
a voluntary basis. In many cases
where a student has a Communist
teacher, the whole class is often
induced to join.
The FDJ is for youth over 16
years of age. Pressure can be
brought to bear on parents to
make their children join, although
membership in the FDJ is also the
oretically voluntary. The parent
is told that his child won’t be able
to take the Ahitnr (the examina
tion at the end of high school
which is required for entrance in
to the university or for many jobs)
if he doesn’t become a member.
AN INTERESTING Commu
nist-initiated practice is the cere
mony of Jugendweihe. At age 14
all students who want to go on to
the Abitur are required to parti
cipate in this ceremony. Prepara
tion for it begins some time before
in the school with extra courses in
dialectical materialism, atheism,
etc. On a designated day the whole
school class formally assembles
and is addressed by a member of
the Party. Then each pupil is
called to the front of the room to
take an oath, whereby he prom
ises to live a life true to Commu
nism and the DDR. He then re
ceives an impressively-bound book
about man, the universe, and so
cialism.

The Catholic Church prohibits
this ceremony of Jugendweihe.
Some youth manage to avoid it,
particularly when a whole class re
fuses to accept it in mass protest.
However, Klaus estimated that 90
per cent of East German youth go
through this ceremony.
In the university the student’s
choice of a major field is still vol
untary, but his political record,
especially his grade in the high
school course on Marxism-Lenin
ism, is a very important factor in
determining whether he will be
accepted in the faculty he chooses.
University students of all fields
must also take an advanced course
in Marxist-Leninist theory. Both
male and female students must
also practice shooting during their
period of study, either in connec
tion with the university or with
the Gesellschaft fur Sport und
Technik, an organization formerly
designed to give technical training
which now is devoted to pre-mili
tary instruction.
ALL YOUTH BETWEEN the
ages of 18 and 24 are eligible for
duty in the Nationale Volksarmee.
Party members distribute forms
to those i n this age bracket—
whether students or factory work
ers—on which the subject must
first sign a statement declaring
that he is “for peace.” Then comes
a second statement explaining
that all those who are “for peace”
must also defend the peace. Thus,
the youth who has signed has de
clared that he is at any time will
ing to join the Volksarmee.
If a person resists signing this
form, he can be exmatriculated
from the university or receive a
poorer job, if he is a factory work
er. He usually declares his willing
ness to join the army, as he holds
this to be a better prospect.
Whereas the Volksarmee and
its auxiliary, the Kampfgruppen
(trained volunteer military groups
of factory workers), exist to de
fend the DDR against all external
enemies, a network of Party mem
bers guards against the internal
enemy and enforces the political
control of the regime upon its sub
jects.
According to Klaus, in each
large apartment house a member
of one of the Communist families
is named as the Hausvertraucns
mann. Ho is the Party representa
tive and has the duty of watching
all the families in the house and
reporting any suspicious activi
ties, such as going to Church. This
person reports, in turn, to a Stras
senvertrauensniann, and the lat
ter reports to a district coordinat
or under the control of the Volks
polizei. Meticulous files are ap
parently kept of suspicious activi
ties of all citizens.
DESPITE these awesome mea
sures, Klaus stated that the great
majority of the population of the
Soviet zone still remain very un
sympathetic to the regime. Indica
tive of this spirit was the warm
greeting given Klaus’ mother by
other families in their apartment
house after Klaus escaped to West
Berlin. One of Klaus’ bosses in the
factory where he worked even
paid a special visit to Klaus’
mother to congratulate her upon
her good fortune—that her son
had successfully escaped from
behind Ulbricht’s wall to freedom.

BERLIN—The Church in East
Germany is the one remaining so
cial institution which has not been
thoroughly uprooted by the politi
cal oppression of the Ulbricht re
gime. Indeed the effect of Com
munism has been to draw the
many denominations, both Catho
lic and Protestant, together and to
strengthen the following of the
Church as a whole. This following,
however, has been weakened some
what by the flight of refugees to
the West.
In spite of the fact that the
Church stands in direct opposition
to Communism and hinders the re
gime in every way it can, Ulbricht
until very recently has allowed it
to continue its activities. How
ever, the Church awaits new and
harsher measures of control by
the State since the 13th of August.
Already there have been several
cases of priests being arrested.
The future of the Church in East
Germany is thus very uncertain.
Communism has had clear ef

tion. Most teachers must be mem

period of several years, and the
student’s success in it is an im

sympathetic to the regime. Indica
tive of this spirit was the warm
greeting given Klaus’ mother by
other families in their apartment
house after Klaus escaped to West
Berlin. One of Klaus’ bosses in the
factory where he worked even
paid a special visit to Klaus’
mother to congratulate her upon
her good fortune—that her son
had successfully escaped from
behind Ulbricht’s wall to freedom.

BERLIN—The Church in East
Germany is the one remaining so
cial institution which has not been
thoroughly uprooted by the politi
cal oppression of the Ulbricht re
gime. Indeed the effect of Com
munism has been to draw the
many denominations, both Catho
lic and Protestant, together and to
strengthen the following of the
Church as a whole. This following,
however, has been weakened some
what by the flight of refugees to
the West.
In spite of the fact that the
Church stands in direct opposition
to Communism and hinders the re
gime in every way it can, Ulbricht
until very recently has allowed it
to continue its activities. How
ever, the Church awaits new and
harsher measures of control by
the State since the 13th of August.
Already there have been several
cases of priests being arrested.
The future of the Church in East
Germany is thus very uncertain.
Communism has had clear ef
fects upon East German educa
tion. Most teachers must be mem
bers of the Party. All students are
required to take a special course
dealing with Marxist-Leninist the
ory and the politics of the DDR
(Deutsche Demokratische Repub
lik). This course is taken over a
period of several years, and the
student’s success in it is an im
portant factor in his later admis
sion to the university.
THE STUDENTS in the East
German gymnasium (high school)
must work for one-half day a week
in the factory as part of their edu
cation. Aside from the educational
aspects of the requirement, this
part-time work serves as an im
portant man-power supplement.
Teachers also spend some time
each week in the factory. During
the summer vacations all students
must work for four weeks in the
harvest. An additional three
weeks is devoted to military train
ing with the Volksarmee.
Two youth organizations supple
ment the political education given
in the schools: the Young Pio
neers and the FDJ (Freie
Deutsche Jugend). The first group

accepts members of school age on
a voluntary basis. In many cases
where a student has a Communist
teacher, the whole class is often
induced to join.
The FDJ is for youth over 16
years of age. Pressure can be
brought to bear on parents to
make their children join, although
membership in the FDJ is also the
oretically voluntary. The parent
is told that his child won’t be able
to take the Ahitnr (the examina
tion at the end of high school
which is required for entrance in
to the university or for many jobs)
if he doesn’t become a member.
AN INTERESTING Commu
nist-initiated practice is the cere
mony of Jugendweihe. At age 14
all students who want to go on to
the Abitur are required to parti
cipate in this ceremony. Prepara
tion for it begins some time before
in the school with extra courses in
dialectical materialism, atheism,
etc. On a designated day the whole
school class formally assembles
and is addressed by a member of
the Party. Then each pupil is
called to the front of the room to
take an oath, whereby he prom
ises to live a life true to Commu
nism and the DDR. He then re
ceives an impressively-bound book
about man, the universe, and so
cialism.

The Catholic Church prohibits
this ceremony of Jugendweihe.
Some youth manage to avoid it,
particularly when a whole class re
fuses to accept it in mass protest.
However, Klaus estimated that 90
per cent of East German youth go
through this ceremony.
In the university the student’s
choice of a major field is still vol
untary, but his political record,
especially his grade in the high
school course on Marxism-Lenin
ism, is a very important factor in
determining whether he will be
accepted in the faculty he chooses.
University students of all fields
must also take an advanced course
in Marxist-Leninist theory. Both
male and female students must
also practice shooting during their
period of study, either in connec
tion with the university or with
the Gesellschaft fur Sport und
Technik, an organization formerly
designed to give technical training
which now is devoted to pre-mili
tary instruction.
ALL YOUTH BETWEEN the
ages of 18 and 24 are eligible for
duty in the Nationale Volksarmee.
Party members distribute forms
to those i n this age bracket—
whether students or factory work
ers—on which the subject must
first sign a statement declaring
that he is “for peace.” Then comes
a second statement explaining
that all those who are “for peace”
must also defend the peace. Thus,
the youth who has signed has de
clared that he is at any time will
ing to join the Volksarmee.
If a person resists signing this
form, he can be exmatriculated
from the university or receive a
poorer job, if he is a factory work
er. He usually declares his willing
ness to join the army, as he holds
this to be a better prospect.
Whereas the Volksarmee and
its auxiliary, the Kampfgruppen
(trained volunteer military groups
of factory workers), exist to de
fend the DDR against all external
enemies, a network of Party mem
bers guards against the internal
enemy and enforces the political
control of the regime upon its sub
jects.
According to Klaus, in each
large apartment house a member
of one of the Communist families
is named as the Hausvertraucns
mann. Ho is the Party representa
tive and has the duty of watching
all the families in the house and
reporting any suspicious activi
ties, such as going to Church. This
person reports, in turn, to a Stras
senvertrauensniann, and the lat
ter reports to a district coordinat
or under the control of the Volks
polizei. Meticulous files are ap
parently kept of suspicious activi
ties of all citizens.
DESPITE these awesome mea
sures, Klaus stated that the great
majority of the population of the
Soviet zone still remain very un
sympathetic to the regime. Indica
tive of this spirit was the warm
greeting given Klaus’ mother by
other families in their apartment
house after Klaus escaped to West
Berlin. One of Klaus’ bosses in the
