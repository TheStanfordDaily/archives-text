I CENTER PLANS
Editor, The Dally:
May we use your columns, in
lieu of the hundreds of letters we
will never find time to write, to
thank people of this campus for
the support they have given the
International Center staff in the
days following our Nov. 19 fire.
The solo consolation about this dis
aster was the spontaneous and al
most overwhelming expression of
friendship that it evoked. Our
telephones have rung continuous
ly as students and faculty and
members of the community have
called with offers of assistance
and words of appreciation about
the I-Center’s place in campus life.
Stanford’s Fire Department did
a magnificent job of saving valu
able records. This must have en
tailed considerable personal risk,
and we are most grateful. The
building is being razed today.
Gail and Yates Hafner, I-Center
hosts, have survived their tempo
rarily homeless condition with
their usual poise and good humor.
International student programs
will continue. We hope to have an
announcement about new arrange
ments in your first winter quarter
Daily. To the numerous foreign
students who during the after
math of the fire asked, “What are
we going to do now? This was our
home,” we can promise that there
will be an International Center in
temporary quarters in January.
