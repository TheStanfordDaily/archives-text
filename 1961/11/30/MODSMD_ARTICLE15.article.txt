## Shake-Up at State Department Shows President Is Learning 
### 
In manner and substance, the
shake-up in the State Department
is heartening evidence of the Pres
ident’s uncommon ability to learn
from experience. It has been evi
dent from the beginning of his
term, dramatically evident after
the Cuban affair, that the rela
tions between the White House
and the State Department were un
satisfactory. The President’s per
sonal advisers did not have the pro
fessional knowledge and diplomat
ic facilities which are in the State
Department. Speaking broadly,
the State Department did not have
the full confidence of the White
House, where policy is ultimately
decided.

As the consequences of this sep
aration of responsibility from au
thority showed themselves during
the spring, the first reaction with
in the Administration was to look
for a scapegoat. He was to he Ches
ter Bowles, and the activists in this
venture talked and acted as if the
removal of Chester Bowles would
solve the problem of the relation
ship between the White House and
the Department of State. Fortun
ately, the ouster of Bowles was
blocked. For t he removal of Bowles
in those circumstances and for
such shallow reasons would have
been a public scandal.
WITHIN THE executive branch
of the government (which of
course did not include Sen. Ful
bright) Mr. Bowles had been the
most conspicuous opponent of the
Cuban adventure. It would have
been scandalous to remove an op
ponent of the mistake when none
of the proponents had been re
moved. Yet it was evident then, as
it is now, that Bowles, despite his
exceptional abilities, was miscast
as Undersecretary of State. It was
not true, howeved, that the trouble
centered in him.
In the four months that have
passed since the abortive attempt
to oust Bowles, the President has
had the time, the opportunity, and
the experience to work out a reor
ganization which affects both the
White House and the Department
of State. The significant thing
about the reorganization is that it
is not built, as have been so many
reorganizations in the past, on the
summoning to Washington of a
new personage to set things right.
This reorganization consists en
tirely of a change of offices and
not of persons. All the key posts
will be filled by men who have had
nine months’ experience in the
Kennedy administration. That is
a good thing, when the men them
selves are good, in that even the
very best new man needs many
months to become broken in.
As I read the terms of the reor
ganization, they mean that the
State Department has grown so
much stronger that the original
arrangement, when so much pow
er was centered in the White
House staff, may come to be
thought of in the future as a stop
gap arrangement to compensate
for the initial weakness of the
State Department.
THE NEW STRENGTH of the
State Department comes in the
main from three men, Rusk, Ball

and Harriman. In the conversa
tions with Mr. Gromyko, Mr. Rusk
proved himself to be a remarkably
competent diplomat. In preparing
the American approaches to the
enlarged Common Market, Mr.
Ball has opened away to what may
be a better future for the whole
Western world. In his conduct of
the negotiations about Laos and
Southeast Asia, Mr. Harriman has
shown the kind of patience, perse
verance and resourcefulness
which are rather rare in our diplo
macy.

As the State Department has
grown in competence, there has
ceased to be good reason for the
existence of a kind of duplicate
State Department inside the White
House. I am not referring to Mr.
McGeorge Bundy, who occupies a
role which, because it is at the in
tersection of strategy and diplo
macy. can be filled in no other
place but inside the White House.
But it is good that Mr. Rostow is
going to the State Department as
head of the Policy Planning Staff.
This is the post which the Presi
dent originally wanted him to fill.

For Mr. Rostow’s gifts, which aro
first rate, are, 1 venture to think,
primarily those of the analyst anti
planner. On the other hand, Mr.
George McGhee, who is primarily
an operator, will be far more effi
ciently placed as the Under Secre
tary of Stale for Political Affairs.
THIS WILL NOT he, we may be
sure, the last or the only reorganiz
ation within the Administration.
The key departments in modern
times ate State, Defense, Treasury
and Central Intelligence. The
Treasury under Secretary Dillon
and Defense under Secretary Mc-
Namara are in excellent shape.
Now that there is a greater likeli
hood that the State Department is
going to be able to play its role in
the conduct of foreign policy, it
should seem easier anti more ne
cessary to reform the CIA. For
the CIA should cease to be what it
has been much too much, an origi
nal source of American foreign
policy. That is what has gotten it
into trouble, and that is what
needs to be cured.

moved. Yet it was evident then, as
it is now, that Bowles, despite his
exceptional abilities, was miscast
as Undersecretary of State. It was
not true, howeved, that the trouble
centered in him.
In the four months that have
passed since the abortive attempt
to oust Bowles, the President has
had the time, the opportunity, and
the experience to work out a reor
ganization which affects both the
White House and the Department
of State. The significant thing
about the reorganization is that it
is not built, as have been so many
reorganizations in the past, on the
summoning to Washington of a
new personage to set things right.
This reorganization consists en
tirely of a change of offices and
not of persons. All the key posts
will be filled by men who have had
nine months’ experience in the
Kennedy administration. That is
a good thing, when the men them
selves are good, in that even the
very best new man needs many
months to become broken in.
As I read the terms of the reor
ganization, they mean that the
State Department has grown so
much stronger that the original
arrangement, when so much pow
er was centered in the White
House staff, may come to be
thought of in the future as a stop
gap arrangement to compensate
for the initial weakness of the
State Department.
THE NEW STRENGTH of the
State Department comes in the
main from three men, Rusk, Ball

and Harriman. In the conversa
tions with Mr. Gromyko, Mr. Rusk
proved himself to be a remarkably
competent diplomat. In preparing
the American approaches to the
enlarged Common Market, Mr.
Ball has opened away to what may
be a better future for the whole
Western world. In his conduct of
the negotiations about Laos and
Southeast Asia, Mr. Harriman has
shown the kind of patience, perse
verance and resourcefulness
which are rather rare in our diplo
macy.

As the State Department has
grown in competence, there has
ceased to be good reason for the
existence of a kind of duplicate
State Department inside the White
House. I am not referring to Mr.
McGeorge Bundy, who occupies a
role which, because it is at the in
tersection of strategy and diplo
macy. can be filled in no other
place but inside the White House.
But it is good that Mr. Rostow is
going to the State Department as
head of the Policy Planning Staff.
This is the post which the Presi
dent originally wanted him to fill.

For Mr. Rostow’s gifts, which aro
first rate, are, 1 venture to think,
primarily those of the analyst anti
planner. On the other hand, Mr.
George McGhee, who is primarily
an operator, will be far more effi
ciently placed as the Under Secre
tary of Stale for Political Affairs.
THIS WILL NOT he, we may be
sure, the last or the only reorganiz
ation within the Administration.
The key departments in modern
times ate State, Defense, Treasury
and Central Intelligence. The
Treasury under Secretary Dillon
and Defense under Secretary Mc-
Namara are in excellent shape.
Now that there is a greater likeli
hood that the State Department is
going to be able to play its role in
the conduct of foreign policy, it
should seem easier anti more ne
cessary to reform the CIA. For
the CIA should cease to be what it
has been much too much, an origi
nal source of American foreign
policy. That is what has gotten it
into trouble, and that is what
needs to be cured.

In manner and substance, the
shake-up in the State Department
is heartening evidence of the Pres
ident’s uncommon ability to learn
from experience. It has been evi
dent from the beginning of his
term, dramatically evident after
the Cuban affair, that the rela
tions between the White House
and the State Department were un
satisfactory. The President’s per
sonal advisers did not have the pro
fessional knowledge and diplomat
ic facilities which are in the State
Department. Speaking broadly,
the State Department did not have
the full confidence of the White
House, where policy is ultimately
decided.

As the consequences of this sep
aration of responsibility from au
thority showed themselves during
the spring, the first reaction with
in the Administration was to look
for a scapegoat. He was to he Ches
ter Bowles, and the activists in this
venture talked and acted as if the
removal of Chester Bowles would
solve the problem of the relation
ship between the White House and
the Department of State. Fortun
ately, the ouster of Bowles was
blocked. For t he removal of Bowles
in those circumstances and for
such shallow reasons would have
been a public scandal.
WITHIN THE executive branch
of the government (which of
course did not include Sen. Ful
bright) Mr. Bowles had been the
most conspicuous opponent of the
Cuban adventure. It would have
been scandalous to remove an op
ponent of the mistake when none

tions with Mr. Gromyko, Mr. Rusk
proved himself to be a remarkably
competent diplomat. In preparing
the American approaches to the
enlarged Common Market, Mr.
Ball has opened away to what may
be a better future for the whole
Western world. In his conduct of
the negotiations about Laos and
Southeast Asia, Mr. Harriman has
shown the kind of patience, perse
verance and resourcefulness
which are rather rare in our diplo
macy.

As the State Department has
grown in competence, there has
ceased to be good reason for the
existence of a kind of duplicate
State Department inside the White
House. I am not referring to Mr.
McGeorge Bundy, who occupies a
role which, because it is at the in
tersection of strategy and diplo
macy. can be filled in no other
place but inside the White House.
But it is good that Mr. Rostow is
going to the State Department as
head of the Policy Planning Staff.
This is the post which the Presi
dent originally wanted him to fill.

For Mr. Rostow’s gifts, which aro
first rate, are, 1 venture to think,
primarily those of the analyst anti
planner. On the other hand, Mr.
George McGhee, who is primarily
an operator, will be far more effi
ciently placed as the Under Secre
tary of Stale for Political Affairs.
THIS WILL NOT he, we may be
sure, the last or the only reorganiz
ation within the Administration.
The key departments in modern
times ate State, Defense, Treasury
and Central Intelligence. The
Treasury under Secretary Dillon
and Defense under Secretary Mc-
Namara are in excellent shape.
Now that there is a greater likeli
hood that the State Department is
going to be able to play its role in
the conduct of foreign policy, it
should seem easier anti more ne
cessary to reform the CIA. For
the CIA should cease to be what it
has been much too much, an origi
nal source of American foreign
policy. That is what has gotten it
into trouble, and that is what
needs to be cured.

In manner and substance, the
shake-up in the State Department
is heartening evidence of the Pres
ident’s uncommon ability to learn
from experience. It has been evi
dent from the beginning of his
term, dramatically evident after
the Cuban affair, that the rela
tions between the White House
and the State Department were un
satisfactory. The President’s per
sonal advisers did not have the pro
fessional knowledge and diplomat
ic facilities which are in the State
Department. Speaking broadly,
the State Department did not have
the full confidence of the White
House, where policy is ultimately
decided.

As the consequences of this sep
aration of responsibility from au
thority showed themselves during
the spring, the first reaction with
in the Administration was to look
for a scapegoat. He was to he Ches
ter Bowles, and the activists in this
venture talked and acted as if the
removal of Chester Bowles would
solve the problem of the relation
ship between the White House and
the Department of State. Fortun
ately, the ouster of Bowles was
blocked. For t he removal of Bowles
in those circumstances and for
such shallow reasons would have
been a public scandal.
WITHIN THE executive branch
of the government (which of
course did not include Sen. Ful
bright) Mr. Bowles had been the
most conspicuous opponent of the
Cuban adventure. It would have
been scandalous to remove an op
ponent of the mistake when none
of the proponents had been re
moved. Yet it was evident then, as
it is now, that Bowles, despite his
exceptional abilities, was miscast
as Undersecretary of State. It was
not true, howeved, that the trouble
centered in him.
In the four months that have
passed since the abortive attempt
to oust Bowles, the President has
had the time, the opportunity, and
the experience to work out a reor
ganization which affects both the
White House and the Department
of State. The significant thing
about the reorganization is that it
is not built, as have been so many
reorganizations in the past, on the
summoning to Washington of a
new personage to set things right.
This reorganization consists en
tirely of a change of offices and
not of persons. All the key posts
will be filled by men who have had
nine months’ experience in the
Kennedy administration. That is
a good thing, when the men them
selves are good, in that even the
very best new man needs many
months to become broken in.
As I read the terms of the reor
ganization, they mean that the
State Department has grown so
much stronger that the original
arrangement, when so much pow
er was centered in the White
House staff, may come to be
thought of in the future as a stop
gap arrangement to compensate
for the initial weakness of the
State Department.
THE NEW STRENGTH of the
State Department comes in the
main from three men, Rusk, Ball

and Harriman. In the conversa
tions with Mr. Gromyko, Mr. Rusk
