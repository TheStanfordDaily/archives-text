# USF Hoopsters Tough to Rate; Face Cards Saturday in Opener
## 
### 
USF, the foam Stanford will
play this Saturday is somewhat of
a mystery. The Dons were rated a
possible WCAC title contender
until they lost a high-scoring for
ward and their starting center.
How they rate now is anybody’s
guess.

They still have two guards that
could play for anybody, but the
front line has been wrecked. A
sophomore question mark will
start at center, and a converted

guard and a two-year regular
start at forwards.

The high-scoring forward is Erl
Thomas, a 6-5 non-such from Mc-
Clymonds High School in Oakland
who set all sorts of scoring rec
ords as a prepster and was begin
ning to find the touch with his
long Jump shot Just before last
season ended.

He averaged 10 points a game
last year and was figured for at
least 15 this season. He met aca
demic trouble and will be ineli
gible until February.

The center out because of illness
is G-G John Galten from Riordan
High in San Francisco. He has
hepatitis and may play, but 6-7
Dave Lee will start. Lee is an un
tested sophomore who showed
promise, but lacks polish. He has
a soft touch from the outside, hut
is a question mark underneath the
boards.
The two highly-rated guards are

senior Boh Gaillard nnrl sopho
more Jim Brovelli.

Gaillard is from (ho East Bay
and could be a great one. He was
all-WCAC last year and USE is
booming him for All-American
consideration. He led USE in scor
ing with a 12-point average and
his floor work and defense draws
raves. Ho is noted for a wrong
foot jump shot.

Brovelli is out of San Francis
co’s St. Ignatius High and is rated
the best guard to come out of USE
since K. C. Jones. He was a phe
nom with the USE frosh last year,
hitting on 50 per cent of his shots
and averaging 17 points a game.

With Thomas out, the forward
spot, is USF’s big trouble spot.
Lloyd Moffatt, first-string guard
last year, isn’t a prolific scorer
despite his ball-handling ability
and dribbling. He’s only 6-1 adding
more problems.
Bob Ralls has height, 6-5, but be
doesn’t score much. An injury to
a finger hampered him last year
and he should be ready to go at
full strength. Ralls adds to an al
ready predominantly Bay Area
team. He is from San Carlos.
Stanford met USE last year dur
ing Christmas vacation, and there
are some who say that game turn
ed Stanford coach Howie Dall
mar’s hair gray. Stanford shot at
an amazing 17 per cent clip, and
was beaten 36-30 in overtime.

guard and a two-year regular
start at forwards.

The high-scoring forward is Erl
Thomas, a 6-5 non-such from Mc-
Clymonds High School in Oakland
who set all sorts of scoring rec
ords as a prepster and was begin
ning to find the touch with his
long Jump shot Just before last
season ended.

He averaged 10 points a game
last year and was figured for at
least 15 this season. He met aca
demic trouble and will be ineli
gible until February.

The center out because of illness
is G-G John Galten from Riordan
High in San Francisco. He has
hepatitis and may play, but 6-7
Dave Lee will start. Lee is an un
tested sophomore who showed
promise, but lacks polish. He has
a soft touch from the outside, hut
is a question mark underneath the
boards.
The two highly-rated guards are

senior Boh Gaillard nnrl sopho
more Jim Brovelli.

Gaillard is from (ho East Bay
and could be a great one. He was
all-WCAC last year and USE is
booming him for All-American
consideration. He led USE in scor
ing with a 12-point average and
his floor work and defense draws
raves. Ho is noted for a wrong
foot jump shot.

Brovelli is out of San Francis
co’s St. Ignatius High and is rated
the best guard to come out of USE
since K. C. Jones. He was a phe
nom with the USE frosh last year,
hitting on 50 per cent of his shots
and averaging 17 points a game.

With Thomas out, the forward
spot, is USF’s big trouble spot.
Lloyd Moffatt, first-string guard
last year, isn’t a prolific scorer
despite his ball-handling ability
and dribbling. He’s only 6-1 adding
more problems.
Bob Ralls has height, 6-5, but be
doesn’t score much. An injury to
a finger hampered him last year
and he should be ready to go at
full strength. Ralls adds to an al
ready predominantly Bay Area
team. He is from San Carlos.
Stanford met USE last year dur
ing Christmas vacation, and there
are some who say that game turn
ed Stanford coach Howie Dall
mar’s hair gray. Stanford shot at
an amazing 17 per cent clip, and
was beaten 36-30 in overtime.
USF, the foam Stanford will
play this Saturday is somewhat of
a mystery. The Dons were rated a
possible WCAC title contender
until they lost a high-scoring for
ward and their starting center.
How they rate now is anybody’s
guess.

They still have two guards that
could play for anybody, but the
front line has been wrecked. A
sophomore question mark will
start at center, and a converted

guard and a two-year regular
start at forwards.
