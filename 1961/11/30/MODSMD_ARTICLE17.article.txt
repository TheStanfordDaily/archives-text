# SRAC Meets Playoff Winner in Mural Final
## 
### 
There’s one team in the Intra
mural football finals, but which
team will provide its opposition is
still a mystery.

SRAC bolstered its claim to be
the top mural football team in the
University with a convincing 25-6
win over tough Los Arcos,
The playoff game between Beta
Biz and Phi Kapps ended in a con
fused mass of football players and
referees. The game had ended in
a 0-0 tie in regulation time, and
an overtime was necessary.

The Phi Kapps got the most
yardage in the playoff, 614 to 6.
However Beta Biz protested the re
sult on the basis that the Phi
Kapps used an illegal formation
on their last play, a quarterback
sneak from the “T” formation.
What it boiled down to was that
the Phi Kapps had 5 men on the
line of scrimmage, in violation of
the rule which allows not more
than four.

However the Phi Kapps protest
ed that an unnecessary roughness
penalty wasn’t called because the
game appeared to be over. Thus
the two penalties cancel each
other, and the fourth down play
will have to be run over, if Beta
Biz wishes.
The situation would bo fourth
down, with the Phi Kapps two feet
ahead of Beta Biz.

The SRAC-Arcos game was
close until the last five minutes,
mainly because SRAC star Craig
Barrett sprained his ankle. Frank
Wallace, probably the most valu
able player in the intramural foot
ball league almost single-handed
ly kept Arcos in the game with his
fine defensive play and his pass
receiving.'
Wallace scored first in what
promised to be the biggest mural
upset of the year.
Ho pulled down a five-yard pass
from “Lux” Goodwin and Arcos
was 6-0 ahead. But SRAC went to
work, leading 13-6 at the half.
Mike Berlolet tossed a 55-yard
scoring pass to Keith Thomasson
and caught a 15-yard touchdown
pass from John 'Nourse.
That was the score until five
minutes were left in the game.
Bertolet wrapped it up with an
other touchdown pass to Thomas
son, this one a seven-yarder.
Bob Besse put the icing on the
cake with a 55-yard broken field
touchdown return of an intercept
ed pass.

Wallace and Bertolet were the
defensive stars. Both batted down
pass after pass, and each inter
cepted three. Wallace allowed
sticky-fingered Nourse short re
ceptions, but kept things under
control.
However Thomasson runs the
440 in 46.1, and that kind of speed
can’t be handled by anyone in mu
ral football.
