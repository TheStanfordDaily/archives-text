# ON SALE TODAY
## 'Bit of Something for Everyone' In Current Sequoia Publication 
### RON RAPOPORT Associate Editor 
A little bit of something for
everybody marks the autumn
quarter issue of the Sequoia,
which goes on sale today and
which can bo given unqualified
endorsement.

The Stanford literary magazine
boasts of some interesting fic
tion, two excellent articles, a well
wrought one-act play, some per
sonal writings and an abundance
of poetry.
“TOGETHER,” a short play
written by Mark (I read the
Daily, daily) Mirsky provides a
suspense-laden plot and fast-mov
ing dialogue which doesn’t spare
the sensibilities of those with
little-old-lady tendencies.
But for those who doubt that
there really is a Mark Mirsky,
“To g e th e r” should be proof
enough.
James Morrison’s article on Po
land (the first of two) is highly
interesting. Showing the extent
to which private enterprise still
exists in Poland, Morrison pro
vides many details which are
probably unknown to most Amer
icans.
DAN McC ALL'S article on
Camus’ “The Stranger,” is most
carefully thought out and pre

sented. McCall is convincing in
his interpretation, but can’t
escape making you wish Camus
were alive so you could ask him
if that’s "really what you mean.”
"Connecting,” a short story by
Sharon Cobb about a boy’s “in
between years,” is quite good. It’s
easy to see what Miss Cobb is
concerned with and that is often
an accomplishment in itself in
stories of this type.
Of the poetry, John Eaton’s
two sonnets, especially the second
one, are well done.
SONYA MICHEL’S inter ■view
with Eleanor Roosevelt is short
(so was the interview, I guess)
and suffers because of this. More
time with the subject would prob
ably have added greatly to this
article.
An account of an alumni meet
ing in Boston, by Diana Smith

Riznik, makes one or two good
points and may give a clue to
the skeptical undergraduate as to
how he will react to alumni gath
erings once he has his diploma.
I have purposely saved discus
sion of the lead Sequoia offering
for last because of one probably
insignificant complant.
THE FIRST PIECE in the Se
quoia is a chapter from an un
published novel by English Prof.
Albert Guorard. Titled “Diplomat
ic Immunity,” it is by far the best
thing in the magazine. But then,
it would probably be the best
thing in a given issue of, say,
The New Yorker.
There is little question that
Prof, Guerard is one of the out
standing men of letters in the
country. He is also reported to
be an excellent teacher, so Stan
ford is doubly blessed in having
lured him away from that East
ern university.
BUT PROF. Guerard is not a
student and Sequoia is, or should
be, essentially a students’ maga
zine. To present a story by him
seems to imply that the Sequoia
ran out of student creativity. It
is something like hiring Johnny
Unitas to play quarterback for
Stanford’s football team, effec
tive but hardly fair.
The fault is not Prof. Guerard’s,
it is the Sequoia’s.

A little bit of something for

The Stanford literary magazine
boasts of some interesting fic
tion, two excellent articles, a well
wrought one-act play, some per
sonal writings and an abundance
of poetry.
“TOGETHER,” a short play
written by Mark (I read the
Daily, daily) Mirsky provides a
suspense-laden plot and fast-mov
ing dialogue which doesn’t spare
the sensibilities of those with
little-old-lady tendencies.
But for those who doubt that
there really is a Mark Mirsky,
“To g e th e r” should be proof
enough.
James Morrison’s article on Po
land (the first of two) is highly
interesting. Showing the extent
to which private enterprise still
exists in Poland, Morrison pro
vides many details which are
probably unknown to most Amer
icans.
DAN McC ALL'S article on
Camus’ “The Stranger,” is most
carefully thought out and pre

sented. McCall is convincing in
his interpretation, but can’t
escape making you wish Camus
were alive so you could ask him
if that’s "really what you mean.”
"Connecting,” a short story by
Sharon Cobb about a boy’s “in
between years,” is quite good. It’s
easy to see what Miss Cobb is
concerned with and that is often
an accomplishment in itself in
stories of this type.
Of the poetry, John Eaton’s
two sonnets, especially the second
one, are well done.
SONYA MICHEL’S inter ■view
with Eleanor Roosevelt is short
(so was the interview, I guess)
and suffers because of this. More
time with the subject would prob
ably have added greatly to this
article.
An account of an alumni meet
ing in Boston, by Diana Smith

Riznik, makes one or two good
points and may give a clue to
the skeptical undergraduate as to
how he will react to alumni gath
erings once he has his diploma.
I have purposely saved discus
sion of the lead Sequoia offering
for last because of one probably
insignificant complant.
THE FIRST PIECE in the Se
quoia is a chapter from an un
published novel by English Prof.
Albert Guorard. Titled “Diplomat
ic Immunity,” it is by far the best
thing in the magazine. But then,
it would probably be the best
thing in a given issue of, say,
The New Yorker.
There is little question that
Prof, Guerard is one of the out
standing men of letters in the
country. He is also reported to
be an excellent teacher, so Stan
ford is doubly blessed in having
lured him away from that East
ern university.
BUT PROF. Guerard is not a
student and Sequoia is, or should
be, essentially a students’ maga
zine. To present a story by him
seems to imply that the Sequoia
ran out of student creativity. It
is something like hiring Johnny
Unitas to play quarterback for
Stanford’s football team, effec
tive but hardly fair.
