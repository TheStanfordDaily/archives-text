Paul Farbanish (8.5. E.E., Lehigh ’5B) is a development engineer who
had design responsibilities for IBM's solid state 1401 computer system.
HE'S MAPPING NEW WAYS TO BEAT
TRAFFIC JAMS IN LOGICAL SYSTEMS

on computer systems by different applications. One of
his assignments was to design new and alternate ways
for data to move from unit to unit with the greatest
speed and reliability.
To do his job he had to become familiar with many
challenging areas of electronics. Within the 1401 sys
tem alone he dealt with circuits, data flow control, input
output, storage, etc.
If a young engineer wants to move rapidly into the
most advanced areas of electronics, he would do well to
consider IBM. In the fast expanding world of data
systems and its many peripheral fields, a man is given
