# Tjader Concert Offers IIR African Funds
## 
### .JERRY RANKIN Editor 
Legislature disposed of a vari
ety of items at its last meeting of
the quarter last night.
Most discussion centered around
the use of surplus funds from a
proposed HR jazz concert. LASSU
approved the concert, which will
be held Sunday afternoon Jan. 21
featuring Cal Tjader. Fred Nel
son of the HR said Tjader hart
agreed to perform free and that
the HR could realize as much as a
$3,000 profit if all seats in Me
morial Auditorium are filled.
Tentative ticket prices are $2..'50,
$2 and SI.
First call on the profit from
the concert would be had by the
HR's exchange with Makerere
College in Uganda. Once enough
money was in to support it for
the next school year, the surplus
would be available for other HR
use. II was over what to do with
this surplus if any that discus
sion revolved.
AFRICAN DESK head Tom
Bailard asked that it be given to
the HR’s book drive, which is
badly in need of funds to store
and catalog books in a warehouse
in San Bruno. He said the books
must be put in order before trans
portation of them can be arrang
ed from here to Washington,
where their transportation is as
sured to Africa.
Nelson requested (hat the funds
be put into the Foreign Scholar
ship Fund, which is in need of
money to help support the ex
change of students Stanford car
ries on with foreign universities.
Legislature finally 7 adopted a
motion by ASSU Financial Man
ager Bud Rafts approving the
concert and directing that once
the Makerere scholarship is taken
care of by profit from the concert,
the rest if any—will go to the
Foreign Scholarship Fund. The
motion added that at a later date
the money put into the fund could
be put to other HR use, including
the book drive, if LASSU ap
pro v 7 ed.
IN OTHER matters, the group
approved the I-Club Internation
al Ball to be hold Jan. 26 at the
Sherat on-Palace Hotel in San
Francisco. Any profit gained from
ticket sales will be used to pur
chase equipment to continue vari
ous I-Club programs and to bene
fit the burned-out Club.
LASSU also okayed $145 spent
to reactivate the alarm system on
the case holding the Oxe in the
Union Store. It voted to under
write up to $2OO the addition to
the Student-Faculty Board’s Stan
ford Professor handbook. It also
