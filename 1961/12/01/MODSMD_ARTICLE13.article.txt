# Sophs Need Dance Title
## 
### 
The Class of 1964 is offering a
pair of free tickets for the best
name for its big. all-campus night
of dancing and entertainment Fri
day, Jan. 19.
Although full details have not
yet been concluded, class social
chairman Tuck Dorn revealed
several items which might help
contestants: the party will take
over all of The Village in the
heart of San Francisco’s famous
North Beach; not just one, but
two bands will be playing all eve
ning a big swing band upstairs
and an Afro-Cuban combo down
stairs; and topflight entertain
ment from between acts at one
of San Francisco's famous night
spots nearby is being scheduled,
Dorn said.

“The term' Cotillion’ is not only
outdated but also hardly seems
adequate to describe this affair,”
said Sally Moran, class vice-presi
dent, “so we decided to let the
whole student body help us choose
a new title.”
Anyone may enter the contest
as many times as he wishes, said
Dorn. Each entrant should sub
mit his name, address, and sug
gestion on a piece of paper and
deposit it in the special box in
the ASSU office before Monday,
Dec. 11. The winner will be chosen
before Jan. 3 on the basis of or
iginality and appeal, he said.
