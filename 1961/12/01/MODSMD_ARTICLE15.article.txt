# Balaguer Junta Rejected By Opposition with Violence
## 
### 
SANTO DOMINGO, D.R. (UPI)
—Opposition leaders backing a
three-day general strike that has
touched off mob violence last
night defied the armed forces and
rejected the proposed creation of

a seven-man ruling junta headed
by embattled President Joaquin
Balaguer.
Balaguer warned that rejection
of the junta proposal couid lead
to “disaster and a new dictator
ship, perhaps worse than the last
one’’ headed by slain dictator Ra
fael Trujillo.
GEN. PEDRO Rodriguez Eche
varia, chief of the armed forces,
warned opposition leaders after
they rejected the junta plan that
further disorders would not be
tolerated.

His communique, indicating all
out military force will be used to
break the general strike, followed
another day of violence in which
a howling mob of more than 1,000
tried to storm the iron-grilled

gates of the national palace.
The mob was turned back by
tank-supported combat troops
who fired over heads and hurled
tear gas and noise bombs.
MEMBERS OF the mob had
gathered to cheer the rumored
resignation of Balaguer. Violence
flared when Balaguer repeated
emphatically that he would not
resign.

The junta proposal was made
by the leaders of the army, navy,
and air force and approved by
Balaguer. The formula called for
the president to head the junta
and command the armed forces
until scheduled elections arc hold
next May.
ALL OF THE suggested mem
bers of the junta were not dis
closed, but it was to include Rod
riguez Echevarria and a top-rank
ing Roman Catholic prelate.
There were no details of how
the armed forces’ proposal had
been drawn up. But informed
quarters said U.S. consul Joseph
C. Hill and the U.S. Undersecre
tary of State for inter-American
Affairs, Arturo Morales Carrion,
had attended a meeting at the
presidential palace where a junta
proposal was drafted.
WHETHER THE formula map
ped at this meeting was the same
one adopted by the armed forces
could not be ascertained.
The continuing failure in nego
tiations came after another day
of violent demonstrations against
Balaguer.

A mob of more than a thousand
persons tried to storm the palace
but was repelled by troops and
tanks who fired over heads and
hurled gas and noise bombs.
THE EMBATTLED palace
guard had to call for reinforce
ments to hold back more than a
thousand screaming demonstra
tors. Two truckloads of combat
equipped navy units roared
through the crowd to take up po
sitions inside the palace grounds
at the bottom of a hill about 200
yards from the domed palace.
Troops ranged behind the fence
encircling the palace hurled
scores of tear gas grenades and
and noise bombs to scatter the
surging mob which broke and ran
but reformed and charged anew.
FOR THE FIRST time in 11
days of disorders, since the end
of the so-called Trujillo era in the
Dominican Republic, palace tanks
rumbled through the gates and
took up position in the street out
side.

They trained their machine
guns on the crowd but did not
fire. Troops inside the gates fired
short tommygun bursts over the
heads of the demonstrators.
THE MOB HAD marched on
the palace from downtown Santo
Domingo after false rumors of
President Joaquin Balaguer’s
resignation touched off wild cele
brations.
Wrath mounted as a demon
strator was shot to death in a
public square by an unidentified
gunman riding on a speeding bus.
He was the first fatality since the
start of the general strike three
days ago, called by the opposition
to force Balaguer’s resignation.
It was reported but could not
be immediately confirmed that
the government and opposition
had reached agreement on a pro
visional government which would
consist of Balaguer, four opposi
tion leaders and armed forces
Chief Gen. Pedro Rodriguez.
