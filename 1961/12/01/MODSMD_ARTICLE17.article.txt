# South Isn't Alone In Discrimination
## 
### 
Buried on inside pages of yesterday’s metropolitan papers was
a story which should cause just as much concern as the front-page
stories about the five Freedom Riders who were brutally beaten in
McComb, Miss., because they asserted their rights as human beings
and American citizens.
The story on the inside pages told how three trade unions, eight
major industrial corporations and two railroads have been charged
by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
with racial discrimination in hiring and firing workers. Some 127
affidavits making the charges were turned over to the President’s
committee on equal employment opportunity, and will be studied
to determine whether those charged operate under federal contracts
and if action can be taken against them.
The groups accused of the. discrimination operate both in the
North and in the South.
Tt seems to us that those who are so quick to condemn the South
for such incidents as the one in McComb too often forget the wide
spread, though unofficial, discrimination in other parts of the nation.
The example of local landlords who refused to rent to Stanford’s
Negro students until forced last spring to sign a no-discrimination
pledge in order to advertise in the Housing Office, should remind
us that often the North, East and West are just as backward as the
South. -
Those who are seriously concerned with eradicating racial dis
crimination realize that it is not an effort which should be confined
to but one section of the nation, but one that must be fought na
tionwide, and for that matter, worldwide.
It is in the South, however, that the battle will be hardest—and
where it must be pressed with most vigor. It is there that racial dis
crimination is law, but where the opportunity exists to at least break
down and wipe out such laws as a necessary first step toward inte
gration.
It should be obvious by now that the federal government needs
more power to step in quickly in racial discrimination cases in the
South—particularly in instances where violence breaks out or is ob
viously threatening.
Of course, the steps should be legal and taken through the courts.
But there is no reason why the federal government should not have
the power to protect the basic rights of its citizens, especially when
individual states refuse to guarantee those rights.
When it comes to civil rights, the federal government should
reign supreme. It should be able to overrule state governments
which thwart the Constitution and deny American citizens—because
their skin is black instead of white—basic human rights.
