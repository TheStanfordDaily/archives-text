DAILY CRITICIZED
Editor, The Daily:
There seems to be some confu
sion as to the function of The Stan
ford Daily. I had thought that it
was a campus newspaper and that
it should cover campus activities.
This does not seem to be the feel
ing of the Daily staff. It appears
at times to be rivaling the Chron
icle.
If this is true, then it must be
failing, for even our own student
body president still reads The
Chronicle religiously. If The Daily
is a campus newspaper, then I
think it has been doing a poor job.
It has little coverage of campus
activities. There is no coverage of
the band, choir or orchestra. There
is no coverage of off season sports.
There is a lot of airing of opin
ions, but The Daily does not seem
to hit main campus issues. When
The Daily does cover student ac
tivities, it appears to be preju
diced. The reporting usually takes
the form of an editorial. A recent
Instance of the infidelity of The
Daily is the coverage of Big Game
activities. Front page coverage
was given to the changing of the
Cal C to an S, engineered by upper
classmen, but the only coverage
given the freshmen was a ques
tionable tongue-in-cheek editorial.
There was a complete disregard
by The Daily of the bonfire, built
by freshmen, or the stunt pulled
off at Cal by 21 freshmen.
This coverage is typical of The
Daily this year. I think that the
Daily staff has failed to realize
what its function is on this cam
pus.

AN D 'MORE CANON GREEN
Editor. The Daily:
It is understandable that Mr.
Will Stone should object to being
told by Canon Green that he would
yell “Crucify Him,” were he pres
ent at the trial of Jesus. It is not a
pleasant idea.
I suppose that there is hardly a
child who, on hearing about the
crucifixion for the first time, did
not say to himself: "If only I had
been there I would have helped
you, Lord.” Decent children (pre-

Christian as well as post-) gener
ally grow up into decent adults.
But where were these decent peo
ple in the restored democracy of
Athens in 399 8.C.? Some voted
to acquit Socrates but more voted
to condemn him. Where were the
good people at the trial of Jesus?
1 suppose (though I should like
to see some evidence of this) that
some of them in their hearts dis
approved of the execution: yet
Christ was killed. Pilate was not a
bad man. Peter, who loved Christ,
said that ho was willing to go to
prison or death for Christ—yet
betrayed Him thrice before the
cock crowed. It was the good, ra
tional people of Massachusetts
who condemned Sacco and Vanzet
ti. It was the good people of Ger
many who presided at the crucifix
ion of the Jews in our own times.
And so on.

Perhaps we would all have ac
quitted Socrates, saved Christ,
been stronger than Peter, boggled
at the injustice to Sacco and Van
zetti, refused to cooperate in the
persecution of the Jews. Perhaps.
History, however, is on the side of
the Canon.

Free will naturally involves
choice and there is no guarantee
that our choices will always be
right ones. Those who do not ac
cept the idea of original sin must
explain in some other way man’s
continuous fall from grace.
I suppose for us at Stanford the
question of assisting at the cruci
fixion of Christ is even more aca
demic than for most. We would
hardly be involved in it because
we should have to go off campus
to hear Him.

GUERARD AT QB?
Editor, The Daily:
In case Mr. Rapoport was un
aware of the fact, “student cre
ativity” runs very thin at Stan
ford. We would be glad to hire
Professor Guerard to play quar
terback for Sequoia any time.
