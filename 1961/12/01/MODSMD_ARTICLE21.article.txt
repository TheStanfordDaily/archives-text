## On 'The Unaligned' 
### 
In his new appointment Mr.
Chester Bowles is to bo adviser
to the President about affairs in
Latin America, Africa, and Asia.
In effect, he will be concerned
with the countries which are not
within the Communist orbit and
yet are not aligned with the anti
communist alliances of which the
most important is NATO. Al
though almost all of these coun
tries are called “underdeveloped,”
they are in fact in all stages of
development. The differences
among them are of compelling im
portance. There are primitive Af
rican tribal communities and
there are economically advanced
but not yet economically auto
nomous countries such as India
and Brazil. Many, like the Sudan,
are devoting themselves almost
entirely to domestic development.
A few, like Ghana, are politically
adventurous.
In viewing the “non-alignment”
of these new nations, it is well to
remember our own tradition of
isolation. All the Founding Fa
thers believed in it, and for a cen
tury' it was the very basis of our
foreign policy. It had two aspects:
The United States was to stand
apart from the quarrels of the
Old World, and Europe was not
to bo allowed to interfere in the
affairs of the New World. The or
iginal and classic exposition of
our own isolation was made by
George Washington in his Fare
well Address.
“The great rule of conduct tor
us in regard to foreign nations is
in extending our commercial re
lations, to have with them as little
political connection as possible
. .. Why, by interweaving our des
tiny with that of any part of Eu
rope, entangle our peace and pros
perity in the tolls of European
ambition, rivalship, interest, hu
mor. or caprice? ... It is our true
policy to steer clear of permanent
alliances with any portion of the
foreign world, so far, I mean, as
wo are now at liberty to do it.”
EVER SINGE WE emerged
from our isolation and neutrality,
we have found it difficult to know
just what to think and how to
feel about countries which are
still isolated and still cling to
their neutrality. As a result, out
opinion has in the mairr swung
back and forth between two poles.
At one pole there is the feeling
that in the great conflicts of our
time, first wdth Nazism and Fas
cism and now with Communism,
to be neutral, unaligned, uncom
mitted, and unengaged is immor
al. At the other pole there is the
reaction against this view. It in
clines to an excess of humility,
and is disposed to accept Presi
dent Tito’s claim that ho and his
fellow-neutralists arc “the consci
ence of the world.”
Since the Belgrade conference
and the inability of the neutrals
to deal w-ith the moral issues
raised by the Soviet’s nuclear ex
plosions, American opinion has
swung sharply towards the view
that we should stop paying hoed |
to neutralist opinion.
There is no point in the arc be
tween the polos of opinion which
can be defined as exactly the
right one. For there is no such
thing as a general attitude to
ward neutrals which will be ex
actly' right for all our dealings
with the infinitely diverse and
conglomerate mass of the peo
ples of the world whose govern
ments are not allied with either
of the great coalitions of the cold
war. For many of us it is always
uncomfortable to find that there
is no black and that there is no
white, but only a large variety of
grays. Yet that is what we must
put up with in the real world.
THERE is AN ENORMOUS
mass of mankind living in many
different states, almost all of
their governments recently cre
ated, who feel that they are out
side the great conflicts w-hich
have preoccupied us for a genera
tion. For them, the burning issue

in the world Is the elimination of
the last vestiges of colonialism,
not (he conflict between Western
and Communist society. Our ef
forts to convince them that colon
ialism has all but disappeared
seem to them to miss the central
point. Our appeals that they con
cern themselves with the subjuga
tion of the peoples of Eastern Eu
rope seem irrelevant to their own
vital interests.
They might be using John
Quincy Adams's words, who once
said that the United States “ is the
well-wisher to the freedom and
independence of all. She is the
champion and vindicator only of
her own,” for ‘‘by once enlisting
under other banners than her
own, were they even the banners
of foreign independence, she
would involve herself ... in all
(he wars of interest and intrigue,
of individual avarices, envy and
ambition, which assume the col
ors and usurp the standard of
freedom.”
Being outside the great conflict
of our time, trying to remain out
side, certainly does not make the
unaligned countries the consci
ence of the world. When it comes
to the vital question, which is how
to maintain the balance of power
which preserves the peace of the
world, the final decision cannot
be left to those who do not have
the ultimate responsibility for
peace. But in all that we do which
affects their development, it is a
different matter. There, we must
have great and continued respect
for their opinions, and the decis
ions must be Joint and voluntary.
AND SO, WHILE it would be
foolish to treat the underdevelop
ed countries as our moral superi
ors, inviting them to lay down
the law to us, it would be no less
foolish, and inherently wrong, to
talk as if we could and shoidd
lay down the law to them. What
is more, we cannot lay down the
law to them.
In the course of time there will
emerge, from the diverse con
glomeration of the underdevelop
ed and unaligned countries, new
powers in human affairs. We can
not buy their friendships. We can
not earn their friendships by abas
ing ourselves as if there were
some reason to be ashamed of the
awful burden of responsibility
which we carry.
If there is any good rule of be
havior, it is, so I think I have
learned from my experience, that
we must not hide our faults. Yet
we must not apologize for them
abjectly as if we alone had faults.
It is not to judge overrighteously
or let ourselves he judged over
righteously. Then with self-re
spect in ourselves we can pay
continual respect to others.
