(EDITOR'S NOTE: The follow
ing article was submitted to The
Daily by Ronald Hilton, director
of Stanford's Institute of Hispanic
American and Luso ■ Brazilian
Studies and one of the world’s
foremost Hispanic American ex
perts. It is reprinted from the cur
rent issue of the Institute's His
panic American Report.
Hilton points out that in a re
cent debate at Stanford on the
John Birch Society, Congressman
John 11. Rousseiot —a Birch mem
ber —“made a violent attack on
President. Betancourt of Veiiezu-1
ela. The attack went unanswered
because there was no one in the
audience who Knew the facts.
“However, Rousselot’s account
of the Venezuelan situaiton is so
distorted and his speeches are lin
ing so much harm to the United
States in Latin America that it
seems important to set the facts
straight.")

A New York organization which
claims to be formulating a Pan |

States but which apparently has
cordial relations with the public
relations agents of Venezuelan die-1
tator Perez Jimenez, has circulat
ed reprints of a seven-page state- [
merit read into the record of the
House of Representatives on Sept. I
2.T 1961, by the Hon. John H. Rous- i
selot, of California.
| Given the inclinations of the
congressman from the lower part
of our slate, the heading “Foxy
Betancourt” makes us smell a rat.
it is printed across the three col-
I umns under a facsimile reproduc
tion of the bannerhead of the Con-
|gressional Record, and this itself,
while technically not illegal, is not
(.■ricket, since the Congressional
J Record does not use banner head
j ings of this kind.
ACCORDING TO the Venezu
elan Embassy in Washington, this
| twisted account of recent Venezu
elan history was prepared by the
j public relations agents of Perez
i Jimenez, who tried to get several
1 other congressmen to read their
| material into the Congressional
Record before Congressman Rous
seiot agreed to serve.
It is possible to make a case
against the Betancourt regime in
terms of ttie inefficiency of the ad
ministration or the unrealistic
I plans to establish national oil ami
| steel industries; what is not fair
| is to dredge up some documents
written by Betancourt in the thir
ties and to use them to “prove”

that Betancourt is now a Commu
nist, w'hen in fact he has been i
vigorously fighting the extreme
leftists and has lost the support
of the radical URD Party while
maintaining the coalition with the
more rightist, Catholic and anti-
Communist COPEI.
Indeed, Rousselot’s account of
recent Venezuelan history sounds
like the Birchite travesties in
which honorable men like former
President Eisenhower, Chief Jus
tice Warren, and Senator Kuchel
are made to appear as Communist
] traitors.
THE RESPONSIBLE US. offi
cials who have supported the Bet i
ancourt regime as a means of j
forestalling a leftist coup are in
sulted in terms which are quite j
improper.
When Rousseiot says, "1 wish
to make it clear that this is not a
partisan pronouncement,” he
means that he is attacking every
| one except his ow-n extreme right
] wing group. The academicians in
{ Washington are dismissed as “the
| glib ex-professors who have fas
tened themselves upon the admin
istration’s Latin American poli
| cies as a sort of pretorian guard.”
! Conservative Adolf A. Berle
I “leads the Betancourt cheering
j squad.” Governor Munoz Marin of
Puerto Rico is “a sort of Gray
I Eminence of the Kennedy Latin
j American establishment.” Adlai
j Stevenson is depicted as naive.
] Charles Bohlen appears as a weak
dupe. Teodoro Moscoso is a tool
j of Munoz Marin, “an American
| Ambassador who would let (Bet
j ancourt) write his own ticket.”
The State Department, in both the
(Republican and Democratic ad
ministrations, has shown “obse
quiousness.”
THE VENEZUELAN Govern
| ment comes off even worse. While
the brunt of the attack is against
Betancourt, Rousseiot singles out
for attack Raul Leoni, president
of the Venezuelan Congress, and
Ricardo Montilla. adviser to Bet
ancourt.
It is quite possible to object to
| making loans to Venezuela, but
| Rousseiot is using unparliamen
tary language when he describes
the request for a loan made by
Finance Minister Tomas Enrique
] Carrillo Batalla as "the latest ex
hibition of Betancourt gall.”
The Venezuelan Consul Gen
eral in Miami, Manuel Ariztegui
eta, is depicted as a vindictive

tool of Betancourt. Other Venezu
edan officials whom Rousseiot vi
tuperates are Ambassador to the
United States Jose A. Mayobre,
Ambassador to UNESCO Mariano
Picon Salas, presidential economic
adviser Carlos D’Ascoli, and Un
dersecretary of State Rafael Me
dina Febres.
THESE ARE the villains of
Rousselot’s gross attack. Who are
his heroes? None other than the
two utterly discredited dictators
Rafael Leonidas Trujillo of the
Dominican Republic and Perez
Jimenez of Venezuela. As for the
j former, the United States is ac
cused of having “cast off our one
dependable anti-Communist
i friend.” These are kind words for
an assassin who plotted the bomb
ing by remote control of Presi
dent Betancourt. If the fate of the
United States is dependent on dic
tators like Trujillo, God have mer
cy on our souls. Moreover, since
Rousseiot’s text makes no men
tion of the assassination of Tru
jillo, it would appear that he was
reading dated material without
realizing it.
After a few kind words for Tru
jillo, Rousseiot proceeds to eulo
gize the real hero of his piece,
namely ex-dictatoi Perez Jimenez,
who is living in luxury in Florida
while using every legal recourse
to fight his impending extradi
tion to Venezuela as a common
criminal; he has been placed un
der $lOO,OOO bail, indeed, one mo
tive for the timing of Rousselot’s
speech was undoubtedly to create
an atmosphere favorable to an
appeal against the ex-dictator’s
conviction.
Perez Jimenez, is described as
“probably the most constructive
ruler of Venezuela in modern
time's.” Under his administration.
Venezuela “blossomed like a ver
itable rose.” The proof of Perez
Jimenez’ greatness is seen in Pres
ident Eisenhower’s gesture in
1954, with a citation praising Pe
rez Jimanez’ achievements "be
fore and after becoming presi
dent.”
THE GORY PROVIDED to
Rousseiot was picked up by Ful
ton Lewis Jr., whose knowledge
of Latin America is about on a
level with that of the California
congressman. Incidentally, they
share the same fringe of the po
litical spectrum.
The final section of Lewis’ at
tack on Betancourt in The Top of

the News (No. 44) ends with the
words “The only hope for (Vene
zuela) is the Overthrow of Betan
court.” This sounds like and has
been interpreted as an incitement
to revolt. While virtually no one
in Venezuela favors Perez Jime
nez, there is constant talk of an
other military coup. Lewis’ re
marks seem calculated to pre
pare the American public for such
an eventuality.
American publicity methods be
ing what they are, the pieces by
| Rousseiot and Lewis received
wide circulation. Virtually no one
saw the rebuttal by Congressman
William Fitts Ryan of New York,
which appeared in the Congres
sional Record for September 27.
1961, but which did not enjoy the
advantage of diffusion by propa
ganda and publicity media.
CONGRESSMAN RYANS re
marks are balanced and judicious.
He points out that (he Commu
nists collaborated with the mili
tary governments of Venezuela,
while they have been the worst
enemies of Betancourt’s democ
racy. Betancourt has repeatedly
declared His hostility to Commu
nism, and his deeds testify to the
sincerity of his words.
Congressman Ryan gives a
careful analysis of the record of
the Betancourt administration,
and. in view of the harm Roussc
lot.’s charges can do to U.S. inter
ests abroad, he suggests an in
quiry into the background of
Rousselot’s speech. “It appears
that an attempt to confuse public
opinion in (he United States is be
ing made for the purpose of sav -
ing Perez Jimenez. This endeavor
to discredit the present Govern
■ ment of Venezuela can have a
dangerous effect upon the con
duct of our foreign policy in Vene
zuela and Latin American and
: should be thoroughly explored
by the appropriate congressional
committees when Congress re
convenes.”
Indeed, the Communists would
■ be smart to translate Rousseiot’s
speech into Spanish and distrib
i ute it throughout Lation America.
■ It would do the United States tin
■ told harm.
THE ENDS .MEET, as they so
i often do, when the Fidelistas and
■ Communists join Rousseiot in de
■ nouncing Betancourt, although
{ their reasons are diametrically
- opposed. The Cuban Communist
I' newspaper Hoy of Nov. 12, react

ing to Venezuela’s breaking of re
lations with Cuba, dismissed Bet
ancourt as “a puppet of the im
perialist Yankees,” who “executed
orders from Washington.” This
line has been followed by the
Communist press throughout the
world.
American democracy is on trial
throughout the world. It is scru
tinized critically by friends and
foes alike'. Congressman Rousse
lot's speech has undoubtedly re
duced the number of the former
and swelled the ranks of the lat
ter', To call that Americanism is
grotesque. Congressman Rousse
lot may have been guilty of noth
ing worse than ignorance arrd
rashness, but we have a right to
expect better and demand more
of our congressmen.
