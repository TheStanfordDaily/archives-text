# SEASON OPENER
## Card Hoopsters Meet USF Saturday 
### GLENN ALFORD 
Stanford’s promising basket
bailors will answer a lot of ques
tions tomorrow night when they
open the season against I he USF
Dons in the Pavilion, Game time
is 8 p.m.
STANFORD HAS several soph
omores that hope to break into
the starting lineup. Tom Dose, a
6-7 soph who broke all sorts of
scoring records first set by Hank
Luisetti, gets the starting nod
over 6-7 Mike Ledgerwood, a reg
ular all last season. Luisetti
scored a few points during his
playing years here.
Another sophomore trying to
make the first five is Hollis
Moore. The 6-4 soph is trying to
make it past Phil Kelly, co-cap
tain with John Windsor of this
year’s version of the Card hoop
squad.
Kelly was one of the most valu
able “sixth men” in the league
last year, and many teams, es
pecially Cal, learned to fear his

jump shot from the corner, so
Moore’s task is not an easy one.
THE OTHER forward is Wind
sor, 6-8, a two-year regular at
Stanford, and the leading scorer
last year, getting over 13 points
every game. He has developed his
rebounding, which wasn’t impres
sive for a man his size. Windsor
always has been a deadly outside
shooter. UCLA remembers his 31
points scored against them last
year to knock them out of the
title race.
Windsor has been driving in
practice, to augment his soft
touch, and the scoring total should
reflect the addition of another
shot.
Stanford’s team leader for two
years had been “Bub” Bowling,
who graduated to the ranks of
coaching this year’s junior var
sity. One of Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar’s biggest prob
lems was to replace Bowling as a
floor leader.
THE REPLACEMENT could be
one of three guards. The Clemet
son twins, Don and Doug and Dar
rell Sutherland are fighting for
the two guard berths, and any of
the three could do the job. Now,
it appears that Sutherland and
Don Clemetson have the inside
track for the starting jobs.
Don was first string last year,
and Sutherland gradually recov
ered from his ankle injury to
play more and more toward the
end of the season.
A winning team is as good as
its reserves, and Stanford has
some good ones. Backing up the
front liners are Jim Bryan, Bob
Sommers, Fred Pegelow, Bill El
fring, Chris Babbs and John
Fontius.
All, with the exception of Babbs,
are experienced, having at least
one year of varsity experience.
Babbs took off a year from foot
ball and appears to have made the
basketball traveling team.
Sophomore Lew Shupe is like
ly to see plenty of action. The
fiery soph could eventually be
Bowling’s replacement as the
Stanford sparkplug.

ball and appears to have made the
basketball traveling team.
Sophomore Lew Shupe is like
ly to see plenty of action. The
fiery soph could eventually be
Bowling’s replacement as the
Stanford sparkplug.

STANFORD HAS several soph
omores that hope to break into
the starting lineup. Tom Dose, a
6-7 soph who broke all sorts of
scoring records first set by Hank
Luisetti, gets the starting nod
over 6-7 Mike Ledgerwood, a reg
ular all last season. Luisetti
scored a few points during his
playing years here.
Another sophomore trying to
make the first five is Hollis
Moore. The 6-4 soph is trying to
make it past Phil Kelly, co-cap
tain with John Windsor of this
year’s version of the Card hoop
squad.
Kelly was one of the most valu
able “sixth men” in the league
last year, and many teams, es
pecially Cal, learned to fear his

jump shot from the corner, so
Moore’s task is not an easy one.
THE OTHER forward is Wind
sor, 6-8, a two-year regular at
Stanford, and the leading scorer
last year, getting over 13 points
every game. He has developed his
rebounding, which wasn’t impres
sive for a man his size. Windsor
always has been a deadly outside
shooter. UCLA remembers his 31
points scored against them last
year to knock them out of the
title race.
Windsor has been driving in
practice, to augment his soft
touch, and the scoring total should
reflect the addition of another
shot.
Stanford’s team leader for two
years had been “Bub” Bowling,
who graduated to the ranks of
coaching this year’s junior var
sity. One of Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar’s biggest prob
lems was to replace Bowling as a
floor leader.
THE REPLACEMENT could be
one of three guards. The Clemet
son twins, Don and Doug and Dar
rell Sutherland are fighting for
the two guard berths, and any of
the three could do the job. Now,
it appears that Sutherland and
Don Clemetson have the inside
track for the starting jobs.
Don was first string last year,
and Sutherland gradually recov
ered from his ankle injury to
play more and more toward the
end of the season.
A winning team is as good as
its reserves, and Stanford has
some good ones. Backing up the
front liners are Jim Bryan, Bob
Sommers, Fred Pegelow, Bill El
fring, Chris Babbs and John
Fontius.
All, with the exception of Babbs,
are experienced, having at least
one year of varsity experience.
