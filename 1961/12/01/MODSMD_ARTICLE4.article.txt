# Justice Department Pressures US Communists Underground
## 
### 
NEW YORK I UPI) The top
leadership of the U.S. Communist
party went underground yester
day, leaving only a troika of
American commissars to take the
rap for refusing to register as
Russian agents.
The Justice Department prom
ised “prompt” action against par
ty leaders for failing to register
as Soviet agents under the 1950
Internal Security Act. The depart
ment was believed making final
preparations to go before a grand
jury and seek indictments.
IN AN APPARENT attempt to
get most of its loaders out from
under the federal law 7 , the Com
munist party dismantled its na
tional hierarchy and left only
three leaders—including national

chairman Elizabeth Guriey Flynn
—as officially acknowledged na
tional officers.
But the three top leaders and
their new faceless comrades were
hard to find yesterday.
AT NATIONAL parly head
quarters here, and at headquar
ters of state party branches
throughout the United States,
Communist party leaders were
“unavailable” or simply “not
here.” In some instances they
were even “out of town,” and no
one would say where.
The Communist leaders were
defying a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling of last June requiring them
to register as agents of a foreign
power Russia. Deadline for the
party as an organization to regis
ter passed Nov. 20, Deadline for
an estimated 10,000 individual
members to register is Dec. 10.
; PARTY LEADERS were report
ed to be attending a secret meet
ing, believed to be in New York,
as the midnight deadline ap
proached. But no one at the three
story red brick building on Man
hattan’s West Side that houses
the U.S. Communist brain center
would confirm that such a meet
ing was going on.
The Communist tactic, obscured
behind an Iron Curtain of silence,
appeared to be following the clas
sic lines of the party in burrow
ing underground.
INFORMED SOURCES close to
the party in Chicago said the
Reds were breaking up their for
mal, publicly-known party appa
ratus to carry on through Com
munist-front organizations that
jdo not or not yet come under
I the Justice Department’s new an
ti-Communist weapon,
j This presumably would give the
j government the job of proving in
court that a suspect was a Com
i munist leader or member before
j it could convict him of failing to
register.
In Washington, the Justice De
-1 partment had no comment on the
(maneuver, but there were indica-
I lions the department was ready to
I move swiftly when the deadline
j passed.

The Justice Department prom
ised “prompt” action against par
ty leaders for failing to register
as Soviet agents under the 1950
Internal Security Act. The depart
ment was believed making final
preparations to go before a grand
jury and seek indictments.
IN AN APPARENT attempt to
get most of its loaders out from
under the federal law 7 , the Com
munist party dismantled its na
tional hierarchy and left only
three leaders—including national

chairman Elizabeth Guriey Flynn
—as officially acknowledged na
tional officers.
But the three top leaders and
their new faceless comrades were
hard to find yesterday.
AT NATIONAL parly head
quarters here, and at headquar
ters of state party branches
throughout the United States,
Communist party leaders were
“unavailable” or simply “not
here.” In some instances they
were even “out of town,” and no
one would say where.
The Communist leaders were
defying a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling of last June requiring them
to register as agents of a foreign
power Russia. Deadline for the
party as an organization to regis
ter passed Nov. 20, Deadline for
an estimated 10,000 individual
members to register is Dec. 10.

ed to be attending a secret meet
ing, believed to be in New York,
as the midnight deadline ap
proached. But no one at the three
story red brick building on Man
hattan’s West Side that houses
the U.S. Communist brain center
would confirm that such a meet
ing was going on.
The Communist tactic, obscured
behind an Iron Curtain of silence,
appeared to be following the clas
sic lines of the party in burrow
ing underground.
INFORMED SOURCES close to
the party in Chicago said the
Reds were breaking up their for

ti-Communist weapon,
j This presumably would give the
