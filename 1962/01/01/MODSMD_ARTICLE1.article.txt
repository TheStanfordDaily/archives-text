# Peace Corps Plans to Double in’63
## Tribal Dances, Chants Spark Ghanaian Nights 
### 
(Editors note: Newell Flather of Lowell, Mass., is a Peace
Corps Volunteer teacher in Winneha, Ghana. The following
is from a letter he wrote.) Six months ago my future seemed
settled and secure. Fresh out of college I had been accepted by the
University of Virginia Law School, and except for a superficial
spring course, \ hardly knew where Ghana was.

A late June telegram from
the Peace Corps, two months
training at Berkeley, two weeks
indoctrination at the University
of Ghana, Legon, and three and
one half months of residence in
Winneba have considerably al
tered this circumstance.
I find my school, my town,
and my job all very interest
ing. The school is deep-seated
and saturated with Ghanaian
revolutionary tradition. As His
tory Department Chairman, I
have been asked by the head
master to write a history of the
school, a fascinating undertak
ing with which I am currently
occupied.

a late show and a late, late show
of magnificent dancing, dram
ming and chanting three or four
times a week.
Real privations have been at a
minimum. My house, a two
mile walk from the school, is
without electricity, refrigeration,
and transportation; but it is com
pensatingly located on the beau
tiful, grassy, warm-wind-swept
plains of Winneba and faces the
distant and lovely Mount Man
koadze. Never before have I
seen so much sky, eaten such
good fish, or breathed so much
good air.

My work has fallen into a sat
isfactory semi-routine. In order
to reach school for the morning
service and the first class at
seven, I rise each day at five
thirty. Classes are completed at
two, at which time I return
home for lunch except when 1
remain on duty until nine, or for
student meetings which last the
afternoon. My teaching, 28 hours
a week of English language,
French language, English litera
ture and British history, 1066-

1485, demands many extra hours
of preparation as well as correc
tions, since I majored in Ameri
can History. Thus I cannot usu
ally retire before ten or ten
thirty.
Extra activities not already
mentioned include additional
classes for the upper forms in
English and history (often for
students not officially in my
classes), and being a Form Mas
ter, the Entertainments Master,
and the Debating Union Master.
It has been interesting to give a
few Saturday night lectures to
the school. The last, a planned
hour and actually three and one
half hours talk on Berlin, has
been the most successful.

1 consider my supreme achieve
ment of the term to be the re
orientation of the school’s his
tory program from British to
West African. This job was left
entirely up to me and it involved
a good deal of reading and study
in order to find the right books
for the students and the right
syllabus for the teacher. I am
looking forward to teaching
West African history next year.

seen so much sky, eaten such
good fish, or breathed so much
good air.

My work has fallen into a sat
isfactory semi-routine. In order
to reach school for the morning
service and the first class at
seven, I rise each day at five
thirty. Classes are completed at
two, at which time I return
home for lunch except when 1
remain on duty until nine, or for
student meetings which last the
afternoon. My teaching, 28 hours
a week of English language,
French language, English litera
ture and British history, 1066-

1485, demands many extra hours
of preparation as well as correc
tions, since I majored in Ameri
can History. Thus I cannot usu
ally retire before ten or ten
thirty.
Extra activities not already
mentioned include additional
classes for the upper forms in
English and history (often for
students not officially in my
classes), and being a Form Mas
ter, the Entertainments Master,

It has been interesting to give a
few Saturday night lectures to

West African. This job was left

a good deal of reading and study
in order to find the right books
for the students and the right
syllabus for the teacher. I am
looking forward to teaching
West African history next year.
