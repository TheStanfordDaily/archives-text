# Sacrifice? 'Hogwash" Says Volunteer in Philippines

At least in the Philippines, the
Peace Corps is not introducing
cultural imperialism; quite the
reverse, most of the Peace Corps
Volunteers are working to erase
that evil.

I and another fellow (an An
tioch graduate), have a house of
our own in the town of Numan
cia of the province of Aklan.
That puts us just about in the
middle of the country in the
region known as the Visayas.
Cocoanuts, fish and rice are the
three major products of the area,
though income is relatively low

in comparison to some other
parts of the country. Our house
is partially of wood construction,
but mostly bamboo and nipa
palm. It’s got a living room,
kitchen, pantry, and bath. The
floors are split bamboo and the
house in general is quite airy,
light and comfortable. It is not
as ornate as the homes of a ma
jority of the teachers we work
with. Physically there are no
problems whatsoever and all this
talk about the great sacrifices
Volunteers are making is just so
much hogwash.
Teaching Teachers
Most of our waking hours are
spent one way or another work
ing in or through the schools.
Specifically, I’ve been in the
Central School, grades one to
six, 19 teachers, approximately
650 kids. The Bureau of Public
Schools requested that we work
largely in the fields of second
language (English) teaching and
science. Those in fact have been
our focal points, though an oc
casional class in water safety or
social studies is also to be ex
pected. Like most of the other
Volunteers, I’ve spent most of

my time working with the teach
ers, helping them develop their
lesson plans, teaching them the
general science they are to teach
their classes and doing demon
strations for science classes and
of second language teaching
techniques for which we were
trained at Penn State and the
training center here. Have also
been building various science
demonstration equipments, as
they are called here.
Now not all of the Volunteers
are focusing so strongly on the
teachers, and I, in fact, intend to
shift emphasis myself when the
new school year begins in June.
Am going to put in several hours
a week working on remedial
English with a small group of
the slower students and on ad
vanced science programs with
about a dozen of the brighter
kids who are more apt to go on
to high school.

The almost universal reaction
of the Volunteer, once he gets
to know his community, is to
attempt to do something about
