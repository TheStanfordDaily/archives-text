# Liberal Arts Grads Requested by Emerging Nations
## Math, Science Instructors In Demand 
### 
The liberal arts graduate has
a wide variety of Peace Corps
opportunities in teaching, since
more than half the Volunteers
are serving in classroom situa
tions.
The majority of the requests
for teachers come in the fields of
mathematics, physics, chemistry
and biology, or for the teaching
of English as a second language.
If new and emerging nations
are to achieve and maintain a
competitive position in the con
temporary world, they must de
velop their own cadre of tech
nicians and scientists, trained to
cope with an increasingly com
plex society.
English, the language in which
some 90 per cent of the world’s
technical writing is available, is
a prerequisite, as are the physi
cal sciences. Therefore, Volun
teers who have had a sufficient
grounding in these areas will un
doubtedly be asked to take
teaching assignments if they are
otherwise qualified.
Qualifications for teaching in
the Peace Corps include a bach
elor’s degree. While the Peace
Corps looks for experienced
teachers, and seeks the graduate
who has been trained in teaching
for some overseas programs, for
mal education courses are not
mandatory in all projects.
