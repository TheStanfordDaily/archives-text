Merit alone determines ad
mission to the Peace Corps.
Since the Peace Corps began in
1961, 35,774 persons have filled
out Questionnaires, the first step
in becoming a Volunteer.
When a Questionnaire is filled
out and sent to Washington, the
listed references are contacted.
While this is being done, the
potential Volunteer usually takes
the Peace Corps Placement Test
which serves as an index of a
trainee’s capabilities in relation
to the job he is selected to do.
No one “passes” or “fails” this
examination.

Peace Corps growth has
necessitated automation of one
phase of the selection process.
Coded information is now re
corded on a computer tape. A
similar tape lists specific require
ments for all Peace Corps posi
tions.


"PEACE GEESE" is the name
given these birds by Peace
Corps Volunteers in St. Lucia.
They were sent to the Island by
Heifer Project, Inc., which is
helping administer the project.
The birds' progress is checked
by Volunteer Merlin Skretved.
