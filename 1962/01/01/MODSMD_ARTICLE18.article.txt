# Initiative, Versatility Aid Volunteer
## 
### 
A liberal arts major who
doesnâ€™t want to go into teaching,
but who would still like to go
into the Peace Corps may serve
in community development proj
ects.
Community development is a
term often heard but seldom
understood.
In the usual sense, it means
the effort of people in groups to
raise their standard of living
through democratic procedures.
Above all, community develop
ment workers must be able to
inspire others to initiate and par
ticipate in social action. They
must be able to serve as catalysts.
Volunteers work on the pre
cinct level with rural and urban
people, helping them define and
place priorities on their needs
and desires, helping them to har
ness their resources and capabili
ties to achieve their goals.
For community development
workers the decisive qualifica
tions are versatility, a broadness
of experiences, a collection of
knacks gleaned from hobbies,
participation in sports, or sum
mer jobs; in short, traits which
many liberal arts students have
gained in the process of growing
up.
To the previous experience of
the Volunteer, the Peace Corps
adds special training in rudimen
tary technical skills.
