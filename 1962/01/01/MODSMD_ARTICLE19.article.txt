# Draft Boards Give Deferment
## 
### 
Military service obligations are
not met through Peace Corps
service. Volunteers can, how
ever, be deferred for the period
of their overseas service and, on
returning home, could qualify
for further deferment at the dis
cretion of their local Selective
Service Boards.
Peace Corps service is “within
the national interest,” said Lt.
Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, Director
of Selective Service.
Volunteers will be classified by
the Selective Service like all
other registrants “engaged in ac
tivities in the national health,
safety or interest.”
