### 
Congress has voted a $59 mil
lion Peace Corps appropriation
for fiscal 1963. The appropria
tion, supported by both parties
in Congress, almost doubled last
yearâ€™s funds.
Sargent Shriver, director of
the Peace Corps, said the second
year goal was to increase the
number of Volunteers overseas
to 10,000.
Praise for the Peace Corps has
come from all sides of Congress
including some of the more con
servative members.
