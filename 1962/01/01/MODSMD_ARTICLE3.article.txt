# Colleges Give Academic Credit
## 
### 
Ohio University will award
academic credit to Peace Corps
Volunteers, announced Dr. Rog
ers Finch, Chief of the Division
of University Relations for the
Peace Corps.
“This is an unprecedented
move which we expect will be
followed by other universities,”
Dr. Finch said. The program
applies specifically to a teaching
project in the West Cameroons,
sponsored by the Peace Corps
and administered by the Uni
versity of Ohio.
Currently, three types of ac
tivities for which academic credit
may be sought on an individual
basis by a Volunteer are:
1) The Peace Corps training
program for which full or partial
equivalency to regularly estab
lished academic courses may be
given by some institutions. Plans
are now underway at Columbia
Teachers College, the University
of Pittsburgh, Syracuse Univer
sity and New Paltz State Teach
ers College to give credit for the
training program.
2) Some colleges will give
course credit for the cultural,
job and language experience
gained abroad.
3) A third potential area of
academic credit exists in indi
vidual study, provided it does
not detract from the basic pur
poses for which the Volunteer is
serving overseas.
