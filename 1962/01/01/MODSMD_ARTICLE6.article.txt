# Mounting Requests Follow Volunteer Achievements

Amid conflicting views of optimism and skepticism, the Peace
Corps launched a scant 18 months ago a new experiment in United
States aid to developing nations.
"A boondoggle,” some cried. “Overseas junkets for beatniks,”
said others.
“A noble undertaking,” countered the optimists.
While the debate continued, thousands of young Americans,
(and some not so young) quietly volunteered their services to

help people in need around the
world. Nearly 5,000 Volunteers
are already at work in more
than 42 countries. By the begin
ning of the next school year,
9,000 Volunteers will be on the
job.
How are they doing? One
measure is the response of the
nations where they have gone.
Every country has asked for
double, triple or quadruple the
number of Volunteers already
at work.
Said Colombia’s President
Valencia in his inaugural ad
dress: "The mission which they
(the Volunteers) are furthering
is truly extraordinary and meri
torious, worthy of Colombia's
gratitude. They make direct
contact with our most humble
people in our towns and vil
lages; they hear their complaints,
understand their anguish and
stimulate their hopes.
“There is no other action
more effective to the service of
continental integration than this
Peace Corps which allows a
young man from Chicago to
know the thoughts of a man
from Sabanalarga or Firavi
toba.”
President Valencia has scored
part of the Peace Corps’ basic
objectives—human understand
ing. Congress defined for the
Peace Corps these primary aims:
I. To help developing nations
meet their needs for trained
manpower.
