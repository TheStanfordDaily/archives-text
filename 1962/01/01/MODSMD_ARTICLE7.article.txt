# Thailand Bout Ends in Draw For Volunteer
## 
### 
For the first time in known
history, an American fighter re
cently came out of the ring right
side up after a match with a
Thai. The American fighter was
Bob Pitts, a Peace Corps Volun
teer, from Redbank, N.J.
Pitts, who teaches physics at
Chulalongkorn University, did
not go into the ring unprepared.
He had been a boxer at Yale
University where he received his
B.A. degree. He had trained for
three weeks under a former Thai
champion, studying the vagaries
of Thai boxing which permits
kicking, kneeing, elbowing and
gouging.
The fans applauded gleefully
as Pitts performed the pre-bout
ritual of drawing symbols and
making incantations to down the
spirit of his opponent, Wooth
Barbos. Although the incanta
tions didn't completely succeed
in downing Barbosâ€™ spirit, they
at least subdued it. The match
was a draw.
Athletic training ranks high in
the needs of developing nations,
in part because it helps develop
health and physical fitness. But
even more important in the
minds of country leaders is the
feeling of national pride and
unity that comes from creditable
performance of their teams at
Olympic or regional games.

school children in San Gregorio, a low-income housing develop
ment in Santiago. Miss Tanner attended Hollins College in Virginia.
