# From The Director

### Sargent Shriver 
America has always expected much from its youth. Alex
ander Hamilton was 31 when he wrote the Federalist papers,
and Thomas Jefferson was 33 when he wrote the Declaration
of Independence.
More importantly, the young men and women of the world
are on the move. The President of the Central African Repub
lic is 31. The Chief of State of Guinea is 39. Mauritania’s
Prime Minister is 37. The Prime Minister of Morocco is 32.
In this world it is an asset to be young and to be committed
to responsibility.

The Peace Corps has already spoken to the heart of a young
nation a nation in which 45 per cent of the people are
under 25 years of age.
Students from more than 800 of America’s colleges and
universities have provided the Peace Corps with almost 90
percent of its Volunteers. Therefore, it is to the future Vol
unteers that will come from campuses of colleges and universi
ties throughout the nation that we are dedicating this special
section.

The world is coming alive. New countries are bursting with
activity. In Latin America and the Middle East, in Africa and
Asia, there is an urgent desire to leap into the twentieth
century.

The Peace Corps is part of our effort to help make that leap
forward a success. It is a part of our effort to help in the
world-wide assault against poverty, hunger, ignorance and dis
ease a grass roots, rice roots volunteer effort of free men.

There has been an important missing link in our existing
programs of foreign assistance and the link was well
described by a student from Pakistan, who said:
“We are not ungrateful for the aid we have received . . .
but it would be infinitely better if it could be done in a more
direct and personal way.”
It is important to emphasize that Americans working abroad
as members of the Peace Corps will receive as much as they
give, and perhaps more. I want to make it clear that when
our Volunteers go to other countries they will go to learn, not
just to watch.

So, we must combine to work together our Peace Corps
Volunteers imparting some of the technical knowledge we have
learned in the last few generations and in turn learning
something of the cultures that have developed in other nations
over many generations. It is a two-way street.

ease a grass roots, rice roots volunteer effort of free men.

There has been an important missing link in our existing
programs of foreign assistance and the link was well
described by a student from Pakistan, who said:
“We are not ungrateful for the aid we have received . . .
but it would be infinitely better if it could be done in a more
direct and personal way.”
It is important to emphasize that Americans working abroad
as members of the Peace Corps will receive as much as they
give, and perhaps more. I want to make it clear that when
our Volunteers go to other countries they will go to learn, not
just to watch.

So, we must combine to work together our Peace Corps
Volunteers imparting some of the technical knowledge we have
learned in the last few generations and in turn learning
something of the cultures that have developed in other nations
over many generations. It is a two-way street.

America has always expected much from its youth. Alex
ander Hamilton was 31 when he wrote the Federalist papers,
and Thomas Jefferson was 33 when he wrote the Declaration
of Independence.
More importantly, the young men and women of the world
are on the move. The President of the Central African Repub
lic is 31. The Chief of State of Guinea is 39. Mauritania’s
Prime Minister is 37. The Prime Minister of Morocco is 32.
In this world it is an asset to be young and to be committed
to responsibility.

The Peace Corps has already spoken to the heart of a young
nation a nation in which 45 per cent of the people are
under 25 years of age.
Students from more than 800 of America’s colleges and
universities have provided the Peace Corps with almost 90
percent of its Volunteers. Therefore, it is to the future Vol
unteers that will come from campuses of colleges and universi
ties throughout the nation that we are dedicating this special
section.

The world is coming alive. New countries are bursting with
activity. In Latin America and the Middle East, in Africa and
Asia, there is an urgent desire to leap into the twentieth
century.

The Peace Corps is part of our effort to help make that leap
forward a success. It is a part of our effort to help in the
world-wide assault against poverty, hunger, ignorance and dis
ease a grass roots, rice roots volunteer effort of free men.
