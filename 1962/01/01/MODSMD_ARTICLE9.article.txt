# From Fishermen To Profs; The Peace Corps Trains All
## 
### 
How do you prepare a Volun
teer who will be a fisherman in
Togo?
On the other hand, how would
you train a Volunteer who will
be a university professor in
Venezuela?
These are the questions that
the training division of the Peace
Corps must face and answer.
The major part of the training
is usually conducted at an Amer
ican university. This lasts ap
proximately ten weeks. Lan
guage, customs, history and cul
ture of the host country are em
phasized. Refresher courses are
given in the work skills that the
Volunteer will be using.
Following the university train
ing, most of the Volunteers go
to Puerto Rico for an additional
month. Contrary to some re
ports, this is no muscle factory.
Physical conditioning, a large
part of the camp’s training, is
adjusted to the individual’s age
and abilities. The program is
aimed as much at the mind as
the body. It is intended to
strengthen self-confidence
through challenge and reveal to
the trainees their own unex
pected capacities. Language
training is corttinued at the
camp.
In most cases, additional train
ing is given the Volunteer when
he arrives in the host country.
In preparing the Volunteer for
his work, there are several basic
objectives:
I. To improve previously ac
quired technical or academic
skills.

2. To insure that the Volun
teers will be able to speak the
language of the country of their
assignment. Instruction averages
as much as five hours daily.
3. To teach the geography,
economy, history, traditions and
customs of the country to which
the Volunteers will be assigned.
4. To insure that the Volun
teers have an adequate knowl
edge of their country and herit
age.
5. To inform the Volunteers
of Communist ideology and tac
tics.

The major part of the training
is usually conducted at an Amer
ican university. This lasts ap
proximately ten weeks. Lan
guage, customs, history and cul
ture of the host country are em
phasized. Refresher courses are
given in the work skills that the
Volunteer will be using.
Following the university train
ing, most of the Volunteers go
to Puerto Rico for an additional
month. Contrary to some re
ports, this is no muscle factory.
Physical conditioning, a large
part of the camp’s training, is
adjusted to the individual’s age
and abilities. The program is
aimed as much at the mind as
the body. It is intended to
strengthen self-confidence
through challenge and reveal to
the trainees their own unex
pected capacities. Language
training is corttinued at the
camp.
In most cases, additional train
ing is given the Volunteer when
he arrives in the host country.
In preparing the Volunteer for
his work, there are several basic
objectives:
I. To improve previously ac
quired technical or academic
skills.

2. To insure that the Volun
teers will be able to speak the
language of the country of their
assignment. Instruction averages
as much as five hours daily.
3. To teach the geography,
economy, history, traditions and
customs of the country to which
the Volunteers will be assigned.
4. To insure that the Volun
teers have an adequate knowl
edge of their country and herit
age.
5. To inform the Volunteers
of Communist ideology and tac
tics.

How do you prepare a Volun
teer who will be a fisherman in
Togo?
On the other hand, how would
you train a Volunteer who will
be a university professor in
Venezuela?
These are the questions that
the training division of the Peace
Corps must face and answer.
