of Norma J. Auer, ’6l, to Rodney

Kepler’s Kwik Kourse No. 1
Reviewing Fall Quarter,
you’ll recall that the Govern
ment and Henry Luce said
everyone should build a fam
ily fallout shelter.
This Quarter the lesson will
be that everyone should build
a community fallout shelter.
In Spring Quarter there will
be a third phase.
Will the Government tell
Henry Luce to adopt the Ken
nedy Plan? Or will Henry
Luce build a community shel
ter for the Kennedy Clan?
It’s too early now to hazard
an answer. Much confusion
will be administered between
now and then. It will be nec
essary for you to read many
books (mostly paperback) by
double-thinkers and policy
makers in order to be able to
swallow the Final Decision
when it comes.
And that’s where we come
in—at KEPLER’S find all the
paperbacks (and some hard
covers).
