“Perhaps the most puzzling phe
nomenon of our puzzling age is the
spectacle of American Liberalism, an en
trenched and listless orthodoxy. pluming
itself as ‘dissent.’ The Liberal is loath to
abandon his cherished role as the Out
sider. Never mind that he has thickened
around the hams, and dozed ojf in a rock
ing chair by the White House chimney.
In his imagination, he will forever play
the rake hell of his
antic youth, forever
the heretic and
breaker of idols.”
