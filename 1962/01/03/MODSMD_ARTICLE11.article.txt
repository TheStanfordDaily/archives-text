# SU Operating Costs Hit All-Time High New Study Shows
## 
### 
Operating costs of Stanford reached an all-time high of more
than .$44 million during 1960-61, the University’s financial report
has disclosed. Costs last year were four times as high as 1951-52 and
twice as high as 1956-57. During the past decade, the report showed:
Costs of instruction and departmental research have tripled, as Stan-

ford improved faculty salaries to
remain competitive with other
top-rated academic institutions;
Costs of maintaining and im
proving the University’s library
system doubled;
Costs of maintaining and oper
ating Stanford’s physical plant
tripled;

suled in the report, were:
ACADEMIC PROGRAM: In
mathematics, an Institute for
Mathematical Studies in the So
cial Sciences and a new Computer
Sciences Division were establish
ed. In medicine, a unique Division
of Clinical Social Work was start
ed. In engineering, a Center for
Materials Research and a formal
program in plasma dynamics
were begun.

COSTS OF STUDENT aid
(scholarships, fellowships and
awards) rose seven-fold, reflect
ing the impact of higher tuition
rates and Stanford’s continuing
effort to help those talented stu
dents who need financial assist
ance; and

In education, the School Mathe
matics Study Group moved its
operation to Stanford. An Inter
national Center for Advanced
Management Education was
launched in the Graduate School
of Business.

Expenditures for organized re
search also increased seven-fold,

In round figures, last year’s ex
penditures included $12,5 million
for instruction and departmental
research; $15.8 million for or
ganized research: $1.5 million for
libraries, $3.8 million for student
aid; $2 million for plant operation
and maintenance; $2.7 million
for additions to existing plant;
$1.3 million for student services;
$1.5 million for administration;
$1.4 million for staff benefits;
and $1.6 million for general ex
penses.
Private gifts—which provide 40
per cent of the University’s day
to-day operating support—reach
ed an all-time high during the fis
cal year.
DURING THE 12 months ended
Aug. 31, gifts to the University
included $10.5 million for operat
ing purposes, $5.8 million for en
dowment, $2.9 million for plant
construction; and $4.3 million in
matching funds from the Ford
Foundation, which provides $1
for every $3 in private gifts se
cured through the PACE pro
gram.
Reflecting both contributions
and a rise in prices, the estimated
market value of Stanford’s en
dowment topped $159 million at
the end of the fiscal year Aug. 31.
While the market value of Stan
ford’s endowment has doubled, it
ranks far behind such institutions
as Harvard, Texas, Yale, Chicago,
Rochester, Princeton, MIT and
Rice in the ratio of endowment
funds to student enrollment.
In addition to $l6 million in
gifts and investment income used
to meet its current expenses, the
University received more than $9
million from tuition and more
than $l9 million for government
sponsored research programs.
Growth in the academic stature
of Stanford, its students, faculty
and physical plant accompanied
the increase in financial support
last year. Some highlights, cap-

STUDENTS: Nearly five per
sons applied for every one select
ed in the Class of 1965. Enroll
ment for 1960-61 totalled nearly
9,300, including more than 3,600
graduate students.

Speakers ranging in viewpoint
from Linus Pauling to Barry
Goldwater were presented by the
Political Union. Two seniors won
Rhodes Scholarships, and the
University conferred degrees on
2,658 —the second largest com
mencement group in Stanford his
tory.

FACULTY: Improved salaries
and a national reputation for in
tellectual vigor helped Stanford
continue to attract top teachers
from throughout the U.S. Among
them: Robert Brown, outstanding
theologian from Union Theologi
cal Seminary; Gordon Craig,
rated by students as Princeton’s
top undergraduate teacher; Emile
Despres, former head of the Eco
nomics Department at Williams
College; Paul Flory and Henry
Taube, both chemists and mem
bers of the National Academy of
Sciences; Albert Guerard, former
Harvard professor of English;
and Edward Begle, of Yale, as
professor of education and mathe
matics education. Under the
PACE program, Stanford plans
to add 125 new faculty members
during the next five years.

During the year Carl D.jerassi,
professor of chemistry, became
the 45th Stanford scientist elected
to the National Academy of Sci
ences. Ronald Bracewell, radio as
tronomer and professor of electri
cal engineering, was made a fel
low of the Instittue of Radio En
gineers. Arthur Kornberg, Nobel
Laureate and head of the Depart
ment of Biochemistry, was elected
to the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.

Expenditures for organized re
search also increased seven-fold,

In round figures, last year’s ex
penditures included $12,5 million
for instruction and departmental
research; $15.8 million for or
ganized research: $1.5 million for
libraries, $3.8 million for student
aid; $2 million for plant operation
and maintenance; $2.7 million
for additions to existing plant;
$1.3 million for student services;
$1.5 million for administration;
$1.4 million for staff benefits;
and $1.6 million for general ex
penses.
Private gifts—which provide 40
per cent of the University’s day
to-day operating support—reach
ed an all-time high during the fis
cal year.
DURING THE 12 months ended
Aug. 31, gifts to the University
included $10.5 million for operat
ing purposes, $5.8 million for en
dowment, $2.9 million for plant
construction; and $4.3 million in
matching funds from the Ford
Foundation, which provides $1
for every $3 in private gifts se
cured through the PACE pro
gram.
Reflecting both contributions
and a rise in prices, the estimated
market value of Stanford’s en
dowment topped $159 million at
the end of the fiscal year Aug. 31.
While the market value of Stan
ford’s endowment has doubled, it
ranks far behind such institutions
as Harvard, Texas, Yale, Chicago,
Rochester, Princeton, MIT and
Rice in the ratio of endowment
funds to student enrollment.
In addition to $l6 million in
gifts and investment income used
to meet its current expenses, the
University received more than $9
million from tuition and more
than $l9 million for government
sponsored research programs.
Growth in the academic stature
of Stanford, its students, faculty
and physical plant accompanied
the increase in financial support
last year. Some highlights, cap-

STUDENTS: Nearly five per
sons applied for every one select
ed in the Class of 1965. Enroll
ment for 1960-61 totalled nearly
9,300, including more than 3,600
graduate students.

Speakers ranging in viewpoint
from Linus Pauling to Barry
Goldwater were presented by the
Political Union. Two seniors won
Rhodes Scholarships, and the
University conferred degrees on
2,658 —the second largest com
mencement group in Stanford his
tory.

FACULTY: Improved salaries
and a national reputation for in
tellectual vigor helped Stanford
continue to attract top teachers
from throughout the U.S. Among
them: Robert Brown, outstanding
theologian from Union Theologi
cal Seminary; Gordon Craig,
rated by students as Princeton’s
top undergraduate teacher; Emile
Despres, former head of the Eco
nomics Department at Williams
College; Paul Flory and Henry
Taube, both chemists and mem
bers of the National Academy of
Sciences; Albert Guerard, former
Harvard professor of English;
and Edward Begle, of Yale, as
professor of education and mathe
matics education. Under the
PACE program, Stanford plans
to add 125 new faculty members
during the next five years.

During the year Carl D.jerassi,
professor of chemistry, became
the 45th Stanford scientist elected
to the National Academy of Sci
ences. Ronald Bracewell, radio as
tronomer and professor of electri
cal engineering, was made a fel
low of the Instittue of Radio En
gineers. Arthur Kornberg, Nobel
Laureate and head of the Depart
ment of Biochemistry, was elected
to the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
Operating costs of Stanford reached an all-time high of more
than .$44 million during 1960-61, the University’s financial report
has disclosed. Costs last year were four times as high as 1951-52 and
twice as high as 1956-57. During the past decade, the report showed:
Costs of instruction and departmental research have tripled, as Stan-

ford improved faculty salaries to
remain competitive with other
top-rated academic institutions;
Costs of maintaining and im
proving the University’s library
system doubled;
Costs of maintaining and oper
ating Stanford’s physical plant
tripled;

ford’s endowment has doubled, it
ranks far behind such institutions
as Harvard, Texas, Yale, Chicago,
Rochester, Princeton, MIT and
Rice in the ratio of endowment
funds to student enrollment.
In addition to $l6 million in
gifts and investment income used
to meet its current expenses, the
University received more than $9
million from tuition and more
than $l9 million for government
sponsored research programs.
Growth in the academic stature
of Stanford, its students, faculty
and physical plant accompanied
the increase in financial support
last year. Some highlights, cap-

STUDENTS: Nearly five per
sons applied for every one select
ed in the Class of 1965. Enroll
ment for 1960-61 totalled nearly
9,300, including more than 3,600
graduate students.

Speakers ranging in viewpoint
from Linus Pauling to Barry
Goldwater were presented by the
Political Union. Two seniors won
Rhodes Scholarships, and the
University conferred degrees on
2,658 —the second largest com
mencement group in Stanford his
tory.

FACULTY: Improved salaries
and a national reputation for in
tellectual vigor helped Stanford
continue to attract top teachers
from throughout the U.S. Among
them: Robert Brown, outstanding
theologian from Union Theologi
cal Seminary; Gordon Craig,
rated by students as Princeton’s
top undergraduate teacher; Emile
Despres, former head of the Eco
nomics Department at Williams
College; Paul Flory and Henry
Taube, both chemists and mem
bers of the National Academy of
Sciences; Albert Guerard, former
Harvard professor of English;
and Edward Begle, of Yale, as
professor of education and mathe
matics education. Under the
PACE program, Stanford plans
to add 125 new faculty members
during the next five years.

During the year Carl D.jerassi,
professor of chemistry, became
the 45th Stanford scientist elected
to the National Academy of Sci
ences. Ronald Bracewell, radio as
tronomer and professor of electri
cal engineering, was made a fel
low of the Instittue of Radio En
gineers. Arthur Kornberg, Nobel
Laureate and head of the Depart
ment of Biochemistry, was elected
to the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
Operating costs of Stanford reached an all-time high of more
than .$44 million during 1960-61, the University’s financial report
has disclosed. Costs last year were four times as high as 1951-52 and
twice as high as 1956-57. During the past decade, the report showed:
Costs of instruction and departmental research have tripled, as Stan-

ford improved faculty salaries to
remain competitive with other
top-rated academic institutions;
Costs of maintaining and im
proving the University’s library
system doubled;
Costs of maintaining and oper
ating Stanford’s physical plant
tripled;

suled in the report, were:
ACADEMIC PROGRAM: In
mathematics, an Institute for
Mathematical Studies in the So
cial Sciences and a new Computer
Sciences Division were establish
ed. In medicine, a unique Division
of Clinical Social Work was start
ed. In engineering, a Center for
Materials Research and a formal
program in plasma dynamics
were begun.

COSTS OF STUDENT aid
(scholarships, fellowships and
awards) rose seven-fold, reflect
ing the impact of higher tuition
rates and Stanford’s continuing
effort to help those talented stu
dents who need financial assist
ance; and

In education, the School Mathe
matics Study Group moved its
operation to Stanford. An Inter
national Center for Advanced
Management Education was
launched in the Graduate School
of Business.

Expenditures for organized re
search also increased seven-fold,

In round figures, last year’s ex
penditures included $12,5 million
for instruction and departmental
research; $15.8 million for or
ganized research: $1.5 million for
libraries, $3.8 million for student
aid; $2 million for plant operation
and maintenance; $2.7 million
for additions to existing plant;
$1.3 million for student services;
$1.5 million for administration;
$1.4 million for staff benefits;
and $1.6 million for general ex
penses.
Private gifts—which provide 40
per cent of the University’s day
to-day operating support—reach
ed an all-time high during the fis
cal year.
DURING THE 12 months ended
Aug. 31, gifts to the University
included $10.5 million for operat
ing purposes, $5.8 million for en
dowment, $2.9 million for plant
construction; and $4.3 million in
matching funds from the Ford
Foundation, which provides $1
for every $3 in private gifts se
cured through the PACE pro
gram.
Reflecting both contributions
and a rise in prices, the estimated
market value of Stanford’s en
dowment topped $159 million at
the end of the fiscal year Aug. 31.
