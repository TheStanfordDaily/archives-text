## New German Situation 
### 
Much has boon changod since
Dr. Adenauer was here last April.
There have been elections in West
Germany, which took place short
ly after the building of the wall
which has completely sealed off
West Berlin from East Germany.
Dr. Adenauer has lost his inde
pendent majority, and he is now
the head of a coalition founded on
agreements which are not known
publicly and explicitly. As the co
alition was being formed in West
Germany, the German Ambassa
dor in Moscow, Dr. Kroll, was
talking with Mr. Khrushchev, and
despite public criticism by some
officials in the foreign office at
Bonn, Dr. Adenauer has confirm
ed Dr. Kroll in his post and has
sent him back to Moscow.
If there is a common factor in
these events, it is that since last
Aug. 13, West Germany has
been engaged in the difficult busi
ness of facing the realities which
for the past 10 years have been de
liberately and artificially ig
nored.

The official fiction has dis
solved, that East Germany would
be liberated from the Soviet pow
er and absorbed by a free election
into the existing West German
state. In place of this fiction
there is now the real German
question, which is how to make a
workable German policy out of di
vergent elements. One is the sol
emn commitment to the Western
Alliance. Another element is the
perennial desire of the German
nation to be reunited. And the
third is the need for an accom
modation with Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union.

IF FOR THE time being there
is considerable confusion and
doubt and disarray in Germany,
it is not surprising. The stakes
are very big, the issues are very
severe, there has been little or no
public preparation for the prob
lems which have to be dealt with,
and there has been no searching
study even among those who are
responsibly concerned.
Here, rather than in West Ber
lin as such, is the field in which
the discussions will move and
eventually policy will be formed.
The naked problem of West Ber
lin, which is to insure it against
conquest or blockade, is no long
er, perhaps was never, crucial.
Khrushchev has been able to
change the situation of West Ber
lin radically without invading it
of blockading it. Now that West
Berlin is separated from East
Berlin by the wall, the problem is
not how to defend its freedom
but how to save it from a slow but
certain death. As the young men
leave, the future of West Berlin
as a living city is a poor one. If
West Berlin can be saved at all, it
can be done only by a successful
negotiation of an international
agreement which gives the city
something definite to live for.
This is what the school who want
to stand pat and stand firm have
never understood.

Barring accidents and irration
al impatience in Moscow, the Ber
lin crisis, as it was expounded
during the early summer, has sub
sided to the point where it is ne
gotiable. What really concerns
us all are Ihe larger consequences
of the German situation as it is
now revealed. Now that the old
fiction which has pretended to be
a policy is gone, in what direction
will the German nation go?

WE HAVE MANY reasons for
supposing that the German na
tion will move in some variant of
it historic national policy. It will
move, that is to say, towards one
of thosg accommodations with
Russia which have for two cen
turies followed its many wars
with Russia. Recent events in
West Germany support this hy
pothesis. The Free Democratic
party, which is conservative and
nationalist, was the chief gainer

in the August election.
It has never lost sight of Ger
many’s interest in the East. The
West German Ambassador in
Moscow, Dr. Kroll, is an avowed
believer in a Russo-German rap
prochement, and the fact that he
was scolded by the minor officials
in the foreign office but upheld
by Dr. Adenauer is, to say the
least, a straw in the wind.
There is little doubt, is seems
to me, that the purely Western
policy of Dr. Adenauer is going to
give way to a more Bismarckian
policy. The problem for the West
is how its ties with West Ger
many can be maintained against
an abnormal and dangerous pull
towards the East. Reunification,
the rectification of the eastern
frontiers, the opening of vast
markets in Russia and in China,
will exert a strong pull on Ger
man policy.

While it is most important to
recognize and understnd this
problem, the wrong way to deal
with it, I am sure, would be to
force the Germans to choose be
tween their role in the Western
community and an accommoda
tion with Eastern Europe and
Russia. Germany as a whole is by
its geography compelled to face
two ways, and we shall be less
than wise if we do not use our
power and influence to work with
the Gormans, never forcing the
issue and never demanding that
they make an absolute choice.
WE CAN AFFORD to be cool
about it. While there is a great
likelihood that the West Germans
will eventually make an opening
to the East, there is no real and
present danger that they will sud
denly surprise us with another
Hitler-Stalin pact. There is popu
lar support for the policy of alli
ance with the West. In the nuclear
age Germany, even if it were re
united, could not be a great world
power. Moreover, the reunifica
tion of Germany is now possible
only in the environment of an ac
commodation with the East, and
a German government, though
perhaps not this one, is bound to
pursue it. Knowing this, we
should not adopt a position of our
own which causes us to try to
make water flow uphill.
Nor is there, I think, any seri
ous danger that in seeking an ac
commodation with the East, West
Germany would withdraw from
the Common Market and from the
still larger market which is about
to come into being in the Atlantic
Community. What is more likely
to happen as Germany maintains
her ties with the West while mov
ing toward an accommodation
with the East is that in new and
unforeseen ways the Iron Cur
tain between Western Europe and
Eastern Europe will be breached.
In short, faced as we are with
a new German situation, we
should look on it not as a catas
trophe but as an opportunity.

Much has boon changod since
Dr. Adenauer was here last April.
There have been elections in West
Germany, which took place short
ly after the building of the wall
which has completely sealed off
West Berlin from East Germany.
Dr. Adenauer has lost his inde
pendent majority, and he is now
the head of a coalition founded on
agreements which are not known
publicly and explicitly. As the co
alition was being formed in West
Germany, the German Ambassa
dor in Moscow, Dr. Kroll, was
talking with Mr. Khrushchev, and
despite public criticism by some
officials in the foreign office at
Bonn, Dr. Adenauer has confirm
ed Dr. Kroll in his post and has
sent him back to Moscow.
If there is a common factor in
these events, it is that since last
Aug. 13, West Germany has
been engaged in the difficult busi
ness of facing the realities which
for the past 10 years have been de
liberately and artificially ig
nored.

The official fiction has dis
solved, that East Germany would
be liberated from the Soviet pow
er and absorbed by a free election
into the existing West German
state. In place of this fiction
there is now the real German
question, which is how to make a
workable German policy out of di
vergent elements. One is the sol
emn commitment to the Western
Alliance. Another element is the
perennial desire of the German
nation to be reunited. And the
third is the need for an accom
modation with Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union.

IF FOR THE time being there
is considerable confusion and
doubt and disarray in Germany,
it is not surprising. The stakes
are very big, the issues are very
severe, there has been little or no
public preparation for the prob
lems which have to be dealt with,
and there has been no searching
study even among those who are
responsibly concerned.
Here, rather than in West Ber
lin as such, is the field in which
the discussions will move and
eventually policy will be formed.
The naked problem of West Ber
lin, which is to insure it against
conquest or blockade, is no long
er, perhaps was never, crucial.
Khrushchev has been able to
change the situation of West Ber
lin radically without invading it
of blockading it. Now that West
Berlin is separated from East
Berlin by the wall, the problem is
not how to defend its freedom
but how to save it from a slow but
certain death. As the young men
leave, the future of West Berlin
as a living city is a poor one. If
West Berlin can be saved at all, it
can be done only by a successful
negotiation of an international
agreement which gives the city
something definite to live for.
This is what the school who want
to stand pat and stand firm have
never understood.

Barring accidents and irration
al impatience in Moscow, the Ber
lin crisis, as it was expounded
during the early summer, has sub
sided to the point where it is ne
gotiable. What really concerns
us all are Ihe larger consequences
of the German situation as it is
now revealed. Now that the old
fiction which has pretended to be
a policy is gone, in what direction
will the German nation go?

WE HAVE MANY reasons for
supposing that the German na
tion will move in some variant of
it historic national policy. It will
move, that is to say, towards one
of thosg accommodations with
Russia which have for two cen
turies followed its many wars
with Russia. Recent events in
West Germany support this hy
pothesis. The Free Democratic
party, which is conservative and
nationalist, was the chief gainer

in the August election.
It has never lost sight of Ger
many’s interest in the East. The
West German Ambassador in
Moscow, Dr. Kroll, is an avowed
believer in a Russo-German rap
prochement, and the fact that he
was scolded by the minor officials
in the foreign office but upheld
by Dr. Adenauer is, to say the
least, a straw in the wind.
There is little doubt, is seems
to me, that the purely Western
policy of Dr. Adenauer is going to
give way to a more Bismarckian
policy. The problem for the West
is how its ties with West Ger
many can be maintained against
an abnormal and dangerous pull
towards the East. Reunification,
the rectification of the eastern
frontiers, the opening of vast
markets in Russia and in China,
will exert a strong pull on Ger
man policy.

While it is most important to
recognize and understnd this
problem, the wrong way to deal
with it, I am sure, would be to
force the Germans to choose be
tween their role in the Western
community and an accommoda
tion with Eastern Europe and
Russia. Germany as a whole is by
its geography compelled to face
two ways, and we shall be less
than wise if we do not use our
power and influence to work with
the Gormans, never forcing the
issue and never demanding that
they make an absolute choice.
WE CAN AFFORD to be cool
about it. While there is a great
likelihood that the West Germans
will eventually make an opening
to the East, there is no real and
present danger that they will sud
denly surprise us with another
Hitler-Stalin pact. There is popu
lar support for the policy of alli
ance with the West. In the nuclear
age Germany, even if it were re
united, could not be a great world
power. Moreover, the reunifica
tion of Germany is now possible
only in the environment of an ac
commodation with the East, and
a German government, though
perhaps not this one, is bound to
pursue it. Knowing this, we
should not adopt a position of our
own which causes us to try to
make water flow uphill.
Nor is there, I think, any seri
ous danger that in seeking an ac
commodation with the East, West
Germany would withdraw from
the Common Market and from the
still larger market which is about
to come into being in the Atlantic
Community. What is more likely
to happen as Germany maintains

power. Moreover, the reunifica
tion of Germany is now possible
only in the environment of an ac
commodation with the East, and
a German government, though
perhaps not this one, is bound to
pursue it. Knowing this, we
should not adopt a position of our
own which causes us to try to
make water flow uphill.
Nor is there, I think, any seri
ous danger that in seeking an ac
commodation with the East, West
Germany would withdraw from
the Common Market and from the
still larger market which is about
to come into being in the Atlantic
Community. What is more likely
to happen as Germany maintains
her ties with the West while mov
ing toward an accommodation
with the East is that in new and
unforeseen ways the Iron Cur
tain between Western Europe and
Eastern Europe will be breached.
In short, faced as we are with
a new German situation, we
should look on it not as a catas
trophe but as an opportunity.

Much has boon changod since
Dr. Adenauer was here last April.
There have been elections in West
Germany, which took place short
ly after the building of the wall
which has completely sealed off
West Berlin from East Germany.
Dr. Adenauer has lost his inde
pendent majority, and he is now
the head of a coalition founded on
agreements which are not known
publicly and explicitly. As the co
alition was being formed in West
Germany, the German Ambassa
dor in Moscow, Dr. Kroll, was
talking with Mr. Khrushchev, and
despite public criticism by some
officials in the foreign office at
Bonn, Dr. Adenauer has confirm
ed Dr. Kroll in his post and has
sent him back to Moscow.
If there is a common factor in
these events, it is that since last
Aug. 13, West Germany has
been engaged in the difficult busi
ness of facing the realities which
for the past 10 years have been de
liberately and artificially ig
nored.

The official fiction has dis
solved, that East Germany would
be liberated from the Soviet pow
er and absorbed by a free election
into the existing West German
state. In place of this fiction
there is now the real German
question, which is how to make a
workable German policy out of di
vergent elements. One is the sol
emn commitment to the Western
Alliance. Another element is the
perennial desire of the German
nation to be reunited. And the
third is the need for an accom
modation with Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union.

IF FOR THE time being there
is considerable confusion and
doubt and disarray in Germany,
it is not surprising. The stakes
are very big, the issues are very
severe, there has been little or no
public preparation for the prob
lems which have to be dealt with,
and there has been no searching
study even among those who are
responsibly concerned.
Here, rather than in West Ber
lin as such, is the field in which
the discussions will move and
eventually policy will be formed.
The naked problem of West Ber
lin, which is to insure it against
conquest or blockade, is no long
er, perhaps was never, crucial.
Khrushchev has been able to
change the situation of West Ber
lin radically without invading it
of blockading it. Now that West
Berlin is separated from East
Berlin by the wall, the problem is
not how to defend its freedom
but how to save it from a slow but
certain death. As the young men
leave, the future of West Berlin
as a living city is a poor one. If
West Berlin can be saved at all, it
can be done only by a successful
negotiation of an international
agreement which gives the city
something definite to live for.
This is what the school who want
to stand pat and stand firm have
never understood.

Barring accidents and irration
al impatience in Moscow, the Ber
lin crisis, as it was expounded
during the early summer, has sub
sided to the point where it is ne
gotiable. What really concerns
us all are Ihe larger consequences
of the German situation as it is
now revealed. Now that the old
fiction which has pretended to be
a policy is gone, in what direction
will the German nation go?

WE HAVE MANY reasons for
supposing that the German na
tion will move in some variant of
it historic national policy. It will
move, that is to say, towards one
of thosg accommodations with
Russia which have for two cen
turies followed its many wars
with Russia. Recent events in
West Germany support this hy
pothesis. The Free Democratic
party, which is conservative and
nationalist, was the chief gainer

in the August election.
It has never lost sight of Ger
many’s interest in the East. The
West German Ambassador in
Moscow, Dr. Kroll, is an avowed
believer in a Russo-German rap
prochement, and the fact that he
was scolded by the minor officials
in the foreign office but upheld
by Dr. Adenauer is, to say the
least, a straw in the wind.
There is little doubt, is seems
to me, that the purely Western
policy of Dr. Adenauer is going to
give way to a more Bismarckian
policy. The problem for the West
is how its ties with West Ger
many can be maintained against
an abnormal and dangerous pull
towards the East. Reunification,
the rectification of the eastern
frontiers, the opening of vast
markets in Russia and in China,
will exert a strong pull on Ger
man policy.

While it is most important to
recognize and understnd this
problem, the wrong way to deal
with it, I am sure, would be to
force the Germans to choose be
tween their role in the Western
community and an accommoda
tion with Eastern Europe and
Russia. Germany as a whole is by
its geography compelled to face
two ways, and we shall be less
than wise if we do not use our
power and influence to work with
the Gormans, never forcing the
issue and never demanding that
they make an absolute choice.
WE CAN AFFORD to be cool
about it. While there is a great
likelihood that the West Germans
will eventually make an opening
to the East, there is no real and
present danger that they will sud
denly surprise us with another
Hitler-Stalin pact. There is popu
lar support for the policy of alli
ance with the West. In the nuclear
age Germany, even if it were re
united, could not be a great world
power. Moreover, the reunifica
tion of Germany is now possible
only in the environment of an ac
commodation with the East, and
a German government, though
perhaps not this one, is bound to

should not adopt a position of our

power and influence to work with
the Gormans, never forcing the
issue and never demanding that
they make an absolute choice.
WE CAN AFFORD to be cool
about it. While there is a great
likelihood that the West Germans
will eventually make an opening
to the East, there is no real and
present danger that they will sud
denly surprise us with another
Hitler-Stalin pact. There is popu
lar support for the policy of alli
ance with the West. In the nuclear
age Germany, even if it were re
united, could not be a great world
power. Moreover, the reunifica
tion of Germany is now possible
only in the environment of an ac
commodation with the East, and
a German government, though
perhaps not this one, is bound to
pursue it. Knowing this, we
should not adopt a position of our
own which causes us to try to
make water flow uphill.
Nor is there, I think, any seri
ous danger that in seeking an ac
commodation with the East, West
Germany would withdraw from
the Common Market and from the
still larger market which is about
to come into being in the Atlantic
Community. What is more likely
to happen as Germany maintains
her ties with the West while mov
ing toward an accommodation
with the East is that in new and
unforeseen ways the Iron Cur
tain between Western Europe and
Eastern Europe will be breached.
In short, faced as we are with
a new German situation, we
should look on it not as a catas
trophe but as an opportunity.

Much has boon changod since
Dr. Adenauer was here last April.
There have been elections in West
Germany, which took place short
ly after the building of the wall
which has completely sealed off
West Berlin from East Germany.
Dr. Adenauer has lost his inde
pendent majority, and he is now
the head of a coalition founded on
agreements which are not known
publicly and explicitly. As the co
alition was being formed in West
Germany, the German Ambassa
dor in Moscow, Dr. Kroll, was
talking with Mr. Khrushchev, and
despite public criticism by some
officials in the foreign office at
Bonn, Dr. Adenauer has confirm
ed Dr. Kroll in his post and has
sent him back to Moscow.
If there is a common factor in
these events, it is that since last
Aug. 13, West Germany has
been engaged in the difficult busi
ness of facing the realities which
for the past 10 years have been de
liberately and artificially ig
nored.

The official fiction has dis
solved, that East Germany would
be liberated from the Soviet pow
er and absorbed by a free election
into the existing West German
state. In place of this fiction
there is now the real German
question, which is how to make a
workable German policy out of di
vergent elements. One is the sol
emn commitment to the Western
Alliance. Another element is the
perennial desire of the German
nation to be reunited. And the
third is the need for an accom
modation with Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union.

IF FOR THE time being there
is considerable confusion and
doubt and disarray in Germany,
it is not surprising. The stakes
are very big, the issues are very
severe, there has been little or no
public preparation for the prob
lems which have to be dealt with,
and there has been no searching
study even among those who are
responsibly concerned.
Here, rather than in West Ber
lin as such, is the field in which
the discussions will move and
eventually policy will be formed.
The naked problem of West Ber
lin, which is to insure it against
conquest or blockade, is no long
er, perhaps was never, crucial.
Khrushchev has been able to
change the situation of West Ber
lin radically without invading it
of blockading it. Now that West
Berlin is separated from East
Berlin by the wall, the problem is
not how to defend its freedom
but how to save it from a slow but
certain death. As the young men
leave, the future of West Berlin
as a living city is a poor one. If
West Berlin can be saved at all, it
can be done only by a successful
negotiation of an international
agreement which gives the city
something definite to live for.
This is what the school who want
to stand pat and stand firm have
never understood.

Barring accidents and irration
al impatience in Moscow, the Ber
lin crisis, as it was expounded
during the early summer, has sub
sided to the point where it is ne
gotiable. What really concerns
us all are Ihe larger consequences
of the German situation as it is
now revealed. Now that the old
fiction which has pretended to be
a policy is gone, in what direction
will the German nation go?

WE HAVE MANY reasons for
supposing that the German na
tion will move in some variant of
it historic national policy. It will
move, that is to say, towards one
of thosg accommodations with
Russia which have for two cen
turies followed its many wars
with Russia. Recent events in
West Germany support this hy
pothesis. The Free Democratic
party, which is conservative and
nationalist, was the chief gainer

in the August election.
It has never lost sight of Ger
many’s interest in the East. The
West German Ambassador in
Moscow, Dr. Kroll, is an avowed
believer in a Russo-German rap
prochement, and the fact that he
was scolded by the minor officials
in the foreign office but upheld
by Dr. Adenauer is, to say the
least, a straw in the wind.
There is little doubt, is seems
to me, that the purely Western
policy of Dr. Adenauer is going to
give way to a more Bismarckian
policy. The problem for the West
is how its ties with West Ger
many can be maintained against
an abnormal and dangerous pull
towards the East. Reunification,
the rectification of the eastern
frontiers, the opening of vast
markets in Russia and in China,
will exert a strong pull on Ger
man policy.

While it is most important to
recognize and understnd this
problem, the wrong way to deal
with it, I am sure, would be to
force the Germans to choose be
tween their role in the Western
community and an accommoda
tion with Eastern Europe and
Russia. Germany as a whole is by
its geography compelled to face
two ways, and we shall be less
than wise if we do not use our
power and influence to work with
the Gormans, never forcing the
issue and never demanding that
they make an absolute choice.
WE CAN AFFORD to be cool
about it. While there is a great
