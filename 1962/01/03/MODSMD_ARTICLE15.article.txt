# 'Mother, Child' Show at Gallery
## 
### 
“Mother and Child Around the
World,” as represented in prints
and drawings, is the title of an ex
hibit now on display at the Stan
ford Art Gallery.
The display has been selected
from a collection of 400 prints and
drawings of the 17th to 20th cen
turies given to Stanford last year
by Mrs. Hattie Hecht Sloss, widow
of former Stanford trustee M. C.
Sloss.
Holdings from the Stanford col
lections supplement the exhibit
which encompasses the “Mother
and Child” theme in most of the
areas of the world. Renoir, Manet,
Utrillo, Whistler, and Currier and
Ives prints are included.
The display will remain through
Jan. 14.
