## More Crises in '62 for JFK 
### MERRIMAN SMITH UPI White House Reporter 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Presi
dent Kennedy has come through
a trying year of unremitting crisis
and this seems lo be his outlook
for 1962.
The President faces tougher
battles in Congress than in 1961.
He' faces off-year elections in the
fall; voting in which the party in
national power usually loses
strength in Congress. This is a
historical process which Kennedy
will attempt to reverse by getting
on the stump, himself, next Octo
ber in behalf of key Democratic
candidates.
The international outlook for
1962 does not, in the President’s
estimation, offer dependable or
extensive prospect of easier East-
West relations. Although he is
hopeful, there is no solid evidence
at the White House of new “give”
in the rocky Russian attitude on
Berlin, Germany, disarmament
and nuclear testing—the so-called
“gut issues" of current foreign
affairs.
THE REAL KEY TO durable
peace in 1962 will be essentially
the same as in 1961 from the
White House viewpoint; Russian
consent to an effective system of
inspection to police any aspect of
disarmament, including a nuclear
test ban treaty. Both sides appar
ently are through with voluntary
test ban agreements, the durabil
ity of which Russia depreciated
rapidly in September by resuming
atmospheric tests.
Aside from the autumn Con
gressional and gubernatorial elec
tions, Kennedy has some other
challenging domestic problems
ahead of him in 1962. These will
center in Congress. He knows he
and his administration are in for
tough sledding with several up
coming legislative proposals.
One is his program of medical
care for the aged to be financed
through payments to and by the
Social Security system. The med
ical profession is poised to jump
on this one when it is resubmitted
to the House and Senate by the
chief executive.

ANOTHER Congressional bat
tle can be expected to develop
over Kennedy’s efforts to con
struct an entirely new reciprocal
trade program with the lowering
of some tariffs to encourage in
creased American exports.
In 1962 the President is deter
mined to try again for Congres
sional provision of federal aid for
school construction and teachers
salaries. He also has promised to
submit a balanced budget for fis
cal 1963, but this will not prevent
energetic efforts by some Repub
licans and conservative Demo
crats to cut it.

Kennedy anticipates a rigorous,
worrisome new year with what
his friends call healthy reality.
The president thinks his fellow
countrymen would be well ad
vised to practice level-headed liv
ing with crisis as away of life
in the Sixties rather than existing
in corrosively futile hope of a
placid, pleasant future with only
well-behaved Communists and no
atom bombs.
THE 44-YEAR-OLD chief execu
tive spent a 1961 that was always
exciting, but not without mo
ments of pain, dismay and disap
pointment. His inauguration last
January was an amazing hour of
triumph for a man so young. He
filled Washington with new faces
—some experienced executives,
some campus idealists, but all
united in a heady forward drive
of new ideas.

Not since the early days of the
late Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New
Deal has the staid capital city
seemed to bubble so much with
furious activity, yeasty energy
and brave talk of challenge. Then
came some sobering realities—a
not entirely charmed Congress,
the dismal failure of the Cuban
invasion, the first evidence of in
tramural conflict which invaria
bly marks any political organiza
tion.

By the end of the year, the
President had gone through his
first major reorganization on his
New Frontier—his shuffling of
his State Department officials.
More key personnel changes are

to be expected in 1962.
THE EXPERIENCES of 1961
produced several major changes
in Kennedy, himself. For one
thing, a recurrence of chronic
back trouble triggered by strain
in shoveling dirt at a tree plant
ing ceremony in (he spring slowed
his recreational physical activity
somewhat. He gave up golf and
switched to swimming in a heat
ed pool.

Perhaps reluctantly, but recog
nizing the almost inevitable, Ken
nedy shifted his views somewhat
on personal diplomacy. When he
entered office, he and his Secre
tary of State, Dean Rusk, were
rather flat in their determination
that diplomacy he returned to
conventional ministerial and am
bassadorial channels with virtu
ally no personal involvement by
the chief exectuive.

Pressures for personal meet
ings between heads of state over
rode the early Kennedy-Rusk con
cept. By the end of the year, Ken
nedy had visited six foreign
countries—Canada, France, Au
stria, Great Britain, Venezuela
and Colombia—plus Puerto Rico
and Bermuda.

In addition, more than a score
of foreign leaders had come to
Washington to see the President.
Like it or not, Kennedy came to
realize in 1961 the inevitable pres
sure for personal diplomacy, al
though he still did not lean to
ward summitry in its fuller sense

of negotiating at the head-of-state
level.

ON THE PURELY personal
side, the President and his family
found life inside the White House
a bit too inhibiting. They relieved
this feeling by spending virtually
every weekend away from Wash
ington—at their rented estate out
side Middleburg, Va.; or at one of
a chain of family establishments
in Hyannis Port, Mass., Newport,
R.1., or Palm Beach, Fla.
Kennedy followed a heavy work
schedule in and out of town. A
Sunday at Glen Ora, the Virginia
estate, was not entirely a matter
of rustication, but a day of semi
rest, punctuated by frequent of
ficial telephone calls and always
an armload of official reading. In
1962, he may make more use of
the White House recreational fa
cility in the Catoctin Mountains
of Maryland, known in the Eisen
hower administration as Camp
David.
