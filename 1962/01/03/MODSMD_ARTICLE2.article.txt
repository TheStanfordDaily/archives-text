lace Sterling.
PROF. LEE, who will hold a
joint appointment in engineering
mechanics and aeronautical en
gineering, joins the faculty next

He is the first of three senior
professors to be appointed in the
field of solid mechanics in the
School of Engineering under a

of applied mathematics since 1948.
From 1953 to 1959 he was director
of Brown’s graduate school of ap
plied mathematics.

cade he helped establish funda
