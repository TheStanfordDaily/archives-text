# Oregon Hoopsters Oppose Tribe Twice This Weekend
## Daily Sports 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
A good Oregon basketball team
will visit the Farm for a weekend
pair of basketball games.

The, Ducks are led by their two
high-scoring forwards Charlie
Warren and Bill Simmons.

WARREN, dubbed “the Fastest
Shot in the West” by Oregon
newspapers earns his nickname
with a quick pair of hands and a
good jump shot. He has been
named to the all-star tournament
team of the Far West Classic
three times, and this year was the
tournament’s most valuable play
er.
The Ducks finished second in
the Classic to the Mel Counts-led
Oregon State Beavers, and with
a player like Counts in the tour
ney, Franklin had to show plenty

to get the award.
Charlie led Oregon to a 15-12
record last year as the top scorer
and rcbounder on the squad.
BILL SIMMONS is currently
averaging around 14 points a
game. The 6-4 senior is second to
Warren in almost every offensive
category.
After these two, the Oregon
pickings are slim.
The center, Wally Knecht, 6-6,
averages eight points a game, but
doesn’t provide any rebounding
strength. The loss of the talented
Glenn Moore at this position left
the Ducks in grave difficulties.
OREGON IS also in trouble at
guard. Despite their 6-5 and 6-3
size, Steve Jones and John Mack

have trouble putting the hall In
the basket.

Oregon lias very little flepth.
Jerry Anderson has done a fair
job as a forward reserve, hut; at
renter and guard the Ducks are
in trouble if one of the starters
has to be removed.

Knecht has played most all the
time, with sub-center Dave Baro
vetto seeing little action.

SUBSTITUTK GUARDS Verl
Pearce, Sandy Nosier, and Tom
Tuttle haven’t played too much
either.

The main Oregon problem is on
defense, particularly at center. If
this problem, plus the problem of
reserve strength at the guard po
sitions, is solved then the Web
foots will not be merely good, but
really tough.
Oregon Coach Steve Belko’s
reputation as a defensive coach,
plus the strong Oregon showing
in the Far West Classic suggests
that these problems have been
overcome.

reputation as a defensive coach,
plus the strong Oregon showing
in the Far West Classic suggests
that these problems have been
overcome.
A good Oregon basketball team
will visit the Farm for a weekend
pair of basketball games.

The, Ducks are led by their two
high-scoring forwards Charlie
Warren and Bill Simmons.

WARREN, dubbed “the Fastest
Shot in the West” by Oregon
newspapers earns his nickname
with a quick pair of hands and a
good jump shot. He has been
named to the all-star tournament
team of the Far West Classic
three times, and this year was the
tournament’s most valuable play
er.
The Ducks finished second in
the Classic to the Mel Counts-led
Oregon State Beavers, and with
a player like Counts in the tour
ney, Franklin had to show plenty

to get the award.
Charlie led Oregon to a 15-12
record last year as the top scorer
and rcbounder on the squad.
BILL SIMMONS is currently
averaging around 14 points a
game. The 6-4 senior is second to
Warren in almost every offensive
category.
After these two, the Oregon
pickings are slim.
The center, Wally Knecht, 6-6,
averages eight points a game, but
doesn’t provide any rebounding
strength. The loss of the talented
Glenn Moore at this position left
the Ducks in grave difficulties.
OREGON IS also in trouble at
guard. Despite their 6-5 and 6-3
size, Steve Jones and John Mack

have trouble putting the hall In
the basket.

Oregon lias very little flepth.
Jerry Anderson has done a fair
job as a forward reserve, hut; at
renter and guard the Ducks are
in trouble if one of the starters
has to be removed.

Knecht has played most all the
time, with sub-center Dave Baro
vetto seeing little action.

SUBSTITUTK GUARDS Verl
Pearce, Sandy Nosier, and Tom
Tuttle haven’t played too much
either.

The main Oregon problem is on
defense, particularly at center. If
this problem, plus the problem of
reserve strength at the guard po
sitions, is solved then the Web
foots will not be merely good, but
really tough.
Oregon Coach Steve Belko’s
reputation as a defensive coach,
plus the strong Oregon showing
in the Far West Classic suggests
that these problems have been
overcome.
