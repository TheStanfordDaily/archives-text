PORTLAND, Ore. (DPl)—The
Rig Five athletic conference may
invito Washington State to join
hut not Oregon and Oregon State,
the Oregon Journal said yester
day in a story from Los Angeles
by its sports editor, George Pas
ero.
Pasero quoted Chuck Taylor,
athletic director at Stanford, as
saying “ . . . That’s the way it
looks. Our president is against it
but Washington State seems to he
the one they’re looking at.”
Taylor was quoted as adding,
“We’ve been battling for the Ore
gon schools. They’re the ones
we’ve wanted all along.”
Washington State, Oregon and
Oregon State were members of
the old Pacific Coast Conference.
The Big Five is composed of other
former PCC members.
Pasero, who covered Monday’s

Rose Bowl game, also quoted a
Big Five spokesman, whom he
said he couldn’t name, as saying
of the possible invitation to Wash
ington State: “I can’t deny it. In
fact, I’d have to confirm you’re
on the right track. I’ve probably
said too much already, but I’d add
it bears looking into.”
