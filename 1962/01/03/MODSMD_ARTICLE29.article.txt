T. S. Petersen, recently retired
president of Standard Oil Com
pany of California, has joined the
top command of Stanford’s $lOO
million fund-raising PACE Pro
gram, as the campaign total rose
above the $3O million mark.
James B. Black and Thomas P.
Pike, co-chairmen of the program,
announced Peterson’s appoint
ment as a joint co-chairman to

share the growing work load upon
the PACE Program volunteer
leadership. He will also be chair
man of the Steering Committee
actively directing the campaign.
Simultaneously announced were
the appointments of Morris M.
Doyle and W. Parmer Fuller 111
as co-chairmen for the San Fran
cisco Bay Area; Richard E. Gug
genhime as San Francisco Bay
Area Major Gifts chairman; and
W. Noel Eldred as regional and
major gifts chairman for the San
Francisco peninsula.
Noting the progress of the
three-year campaign since it was
formally launched last April, new
National Co-Chairman Petersen
said it represented a “real achieve
ment.” The total at close of No
vember was $30,094,000.
“Stanford has set an ambitious
goal in seeking $lOO million to
help set new standards of educa
tional excellence in the West,” he
said, “but I firmly believe it can
succeed.

“The growing sense of respon
sibility toward the non-tax-sup
ported sector of higher education
is a heartening thing to see. Many
people are thinking about it who
have not done so before.”
