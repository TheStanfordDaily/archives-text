# Panofsky Named Head SU Accelerator Project
## 
### 
Prof. Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky,
internationally prominent Stan
ford physicist and a member of
President Kennedy’s Science Advi
sory Committee, has been named
director of the University’s $ll4
million linear accelerator project
being financed by the U.S. Atomic-
Energy Commission.
Physics Prof. Edward L. Ginz
ton, who headed the two-mile ac
celerator project during its eaxlier
stages, will continue as a pxoject
consultant to the University. He
has played a key role in accelera
tor development at Stanford for
the past 15 years.

DR. GINZTON withdrew from
active project direction some time
ago because of other demands on
his time. In addition to his faculty
duties he is board chairman of
Varian Associates, a well-known
electronics firm.

Dr. Panofsky previously has
been deputy director of the two
mile accelerator project. It was
his interest in linear accelerators
that attracted him to Stanford in
1951, and he soon took charge of
the University’s Mark 111 billion
volt linear accelerator.
STUDIES of nuclear structures
made with this machine earned
the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics
for another Stanford physics pro
fessor. Dr. Robert Uofstadter.

Congress approved the two
mile accelerator project last sum
mer, and a Stanford contract with
the AEC for its construction is
now being negotiated.

Project engineers hope to break
ground early next year for the
first buildings on the site, which
is located along Sand Hill Road in
Menlo Park. Completion is sched
uled about six years from the
stall of construction.
