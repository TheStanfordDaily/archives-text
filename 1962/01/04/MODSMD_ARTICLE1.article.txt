## 
### 
LISBON (UPI) Prime Minis
ter Antonio De Oliveira Salazar
threatened yesterday to take Por
tugal out of the United Nations
because of its refusal to halt the
Indian invasion of Goa.
He proclaimed an immediate
boycott of most U.N. activities.
“The United Nations is not only
useless but actively harmful,” he

said in a bitter attack on the or
ganization.
“I DO NOT YET know whether
we shall bo the first country to
abandon the United Nations but
we shall surely be among the
first,” his prepared speech said.
“Meanwhile, we shall refuse them
our collaboration in everything
that is not in our direct interest.”

His speech was read to the na
tional assembly by assembly
speaker Mario De Figuoiredo aft
er a few introductory remarks by
Salazar. There was no immediate
explanation but Salazar, 72,
sounded tired when he spoke.

An aide said later Salazar was
suffering from a sore throat
brought on by emotional strain in
recent weeks.
SALAZAR PRAISED the Unit
ed States for its attempts both in
Washington and New Delhi to dis
suade India from attacking Goa.
He also thanked it for a formal
note last summer pledging itself
to oppose any attack on Portu
gese colonies.

Salazar said Britain’s failure to
come to the aid of Portugal, its
oldest ally, had kept his country
from putting up a strong fight
for Goa.
BUT HE SAID both the United
States and Britain shared Portu
gal’s defeat in Goa. This, he said,
“predicts a fearful catastrophe
for the world. When small nations
are defeated it is sad and afflict
ing but the powerlessness of the
great to defend the right is in
comparably graver.”
He did not mention a possible
withdrawal from NATO but de
voted much of his speech to the
loss of Goa. Diplomats in Lisbon
had predicted Portugal might
withdraw from the United Na
tions and NATO.

to oppose any attack on Portu
gese colonies.

Salazar said Britain’s failure to
come to the aid of Portugal, its
oldest ally, had kept his country
from putting up a strong fight
for Goa.
BUT HE SAID both the United
States and Britain shared Portu
gal’s defeat in Goa. This, he said,
“predicts a fearful catastrophe
for the world. When small nations
are defeated it is sad and afflict
ing but the powerlessness of the
great to defend the right is in
comparably graver.”
He did not mention a possible
withdrawal from NATO but de
voted much of his speech to the
loss of Goa. Diplomats in Lisbon
had predicted Portugal might
withdraw from the United Na
tions and NATO.
