# PROGRAM REORGANIZED
## Yale Engineers Get New Liberal Arts Emphasis 
### MIKE WAGGONER 
Yale, following a trend in the
Ivy League, is reorganizing its
engineering program, hoping to
lift it above the current criticism
of engineers as being uncultured
and insufficiently grounded in sci
ence.
The reorganization plan, recom
mended by a committee of ex
perts from Harvard and other
leading institutions, will abolish
the undergraduate division of
Yale’s school of engineering,
shifting undergraduate engineer
ing students into the Yale Col
lege, the liberal arts part of Yale.
Dean Joseph M. Pettit of the
Stanford School of Engineering
expected the Yale Program to
have little impact. The program is
not new and “Yale is not primari
ly an engineering school,” he
stated. “We will, of course, fol
low the progress of the program,
but expect it to have little appli
cation here.”

The proposed changes at Yale
will place the engineering course
into the same form as law. medi
cine and most business schools.
The plan will be put into effect
over the next two years.
Undergraduate students will
declare engineering as their ma
jor, with their program heavy in
both science and liberal arts. Up
on graduation they will enter one
of two programs, one stressing
research and the other, problem
analysis and design.
Degrees of Master of Science,
Doctor of Philosophy, Master of
Engineering and Doctor of En
gineering will he awarded.
THE COMMITTEE stated that
this change was required by the
accelerating advance of science.
Technical knowledge becomes ob
solete so fast that an engineer
must have a strong scientific and
math background in order to
learn the new developments.
The committee likened the pro
gram to producing scientists in

the undergraduate program, then
teaching them engineering.
Pettit of Stanford pointed out
that engineering students here
are subject to the General
Studies requirement, and that un
til World War II to A.B. require
ments.

He noted that Stanford, as are
most other engineering schools,
is raising the amount of science
education, and that the curricula
diverge for experimental or prac
tical work.
Pettit also stated that “about
one-third” of all Stanford engi
neering students do graduate
work, though not necessarily at
Stanford.

Stanford is one of the top en
gineering schools in the country,
ranking first in awards of Elec
trical Engineering Ph.D’s. and
fourth in over-all graduate engi
neering work.

Dean Joseph M. Pettit of the
Stanford School of Engineering
expected the Yale Program to
have little impact. The program is
not new and “Yale is not primari
ly an engineering school,” he
stated. “We will, of course, fol
low the progress of the program,
but expect it to have little appli
cation here.”

The proposed changes at Yale
will place the engineering course
into the same form as law. medi
cine and most business schools.
The plan will be put into effect
over the next two years.
Undergraduate students will
declare engineering as their ma
jor, with their program heavy in
both science and liberal arts. Up
on graduation they will enter one
of two programs, one stressing
research and the other, problem
analysis and design.
Degrees of Master of Science,
Doctor of Philosophy, Master of
Engineering and Doctor of En
gineering will he awarded.
THE COMMITTEE stated that
this change was required by the
accelerating advance of science.
Technical knowledge becomes ob
solete so fast that an engineer
must have a strong scientific and
math background in order to
learn the new developments.
The committee likened the pro
gram to producing scientists in

the undergraduate program, then
teaching them engineering.
Pettit of Stanford pointed out
that engineering students here
are subject to the General
Studies requirement, and that un
til World War II to A.B. require
ments.

He noted that Stanford, as are
most other engineering schools,
is raising the amount of science
education, and that the curricula
diverge for experimental or prac
tical work.
Pettit also stated that “about
one-third” of all Stanford engi
neering students do graduate
work, though not necessarily at
Stanford.

Stanford is one of the top en
gineering schools in the country,
ranking first in awards of Elec
trical Engineering Ph.D’s. and
fourth in over-all graduate engi
neering work.
Yale, following a trend in the
Ivy League, is reorganizing its
engineering program, hoping to
lift it above the current criticism
of engineers as being uncultured
and insufficiently grounded in sci
ence.
The reorganization plan, recom
mended by a committee of ex
perts from Harvard and other
leading institutions, will abolish
the undergraduate division of
Yale’s school of engineering,
shifting undergraduate engineer
ing students into the Yale Col
lege, the liberal arts part of Yale.
