## One Quarrel Too Many 
### 
As if there were not enough
serious problems for this country
to worry about, we hear voices
asking us to divide angrily, one
party lined up behind one Congo
lese politician, the other party
behind another. Are we really
supposed to believe that in the
tribal conflicts of the Congo the
great principles of freedom and
religion and peace are bound up
with one set of politicians or an
other? Must we divide the United
States, proclaiming high-falutin
slogans and carrying the banners
of tribes and factions from a
country which is not in the least
prepared to govern itself?
Whether we like it or not, and
there can be few among us who
do like it, we have had landed on
our doorstep a tragic muddle. The
United States government had no
power and no responsibility in the
Congo until 17 months ago, when,
without preparation, without edu
cation and training for govern
ment, the Belgian Congo was
launched as an independent state.
Within five days its army mu
tinied, many of the European
whites were horribly maltreated,
and the Congo problem was turn
ed over to the U.N. because no
body else knew what to do with
it. The U.N. was brought into the
Congo with the blessings of Presi
dent Eisenhower and all of the
West European governments.
FOB ALL PRACTICAL pur
poses the problem of the Congo
is insoluble in this generation.
For it is impossible to imagine
an independent and self-governing
Congo. The Congolese people,
who are divided into many tribes,
are largely illiterate. Among them
there is no remotely sufficient
number of educated men to run a
government and manage an econ
omy. The problem of the Congo
is how to construct on such weak
foundations and out of such diffi
cult material a governing authori
ty capable of maintaining order,
able and willing to undertake the
very long process of recruiting
and educating a native governing
class.

If we look at this formidable
problem with the determination
not to deceive ourselves, we are
bound, I believe, to conclude that
there can be no solution except
through some kind of tutelage.
Whore shall the tutors be found?
The Soviet government, no doubt,
would be quite willing to try to
provide them. But we could never
tolerate the establishment of
Soviet power in the heart of Af
rica. The United States, if it were
asked, would not be willing to
provide the tutors. For with our
own unsolved problem, which
comes from Africa, we know that
we are not now qualified for such
a task.

As a matter of fact there is only
one nation qualified to supply the
tutors. That nation is Belgium.
But the obstacle to the Belgians
is obvious. The obstacle is the
memory of the colonial past.
Apart from that, the Belgians are
uniquely qualified by knowledge
and experience.
FINALLY, AND AS a last re
sort. there is the experiment
which Dag Hammarskjold set in
motion. In its esence, it looks to
an unostentatious tutelage car
ried on by that new breed of offi
cials, the international civil serv
ants, working under the aegis of
the United Nations and subject
to its over-all control. They could
recruit from all over the world,
including Belgium, technical and
expert help without which the
Congo cannot be a workable soci
ety.

We do not know whether the
U.N. experiment can succeed. We
do know that there is no toler
able alternative. Congolese unity
without tutelage will quickly dis

solve into chaos. Congolese par
tition, with Katanga joining Rho
desia, Angola and South Africa
in a redoubt of white supremacy,
would surely precipitate a hor
rible racial conflict on the African
continent.

But the U.N. experiment can
succeed only if it has the genuine
support of the Western powers.
If it has their support, most par
ticularly the support of Great
Britain, Belgium and the United
States, the experiment may suc
ceed. The Congo lies within the
military orbit of the Western
world and the Soviet Union does
not have the reach—when the
West is united—to intervene ef
fectively in the heart of Africa.
It follows that though it is im
portant to work out arrangements
between Tshombe and Adoula, it
is even more important, indeed it
is decisively important, that
Messrs. Spaak, Macmillan, Ken
nedy and—let us hope—Gen. de
Gaulle, can agree on what is to be
done. For the decisions, make or
break, will be made not in Leo
poldville, Elizabethville, or in New
York. They will be made in Brus
sels, London and Washington.
