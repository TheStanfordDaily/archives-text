### 
WASHINGTON (UPD—Senate
Democratic Leader Mike Mans
field sharply criticized radicals of
both the left and right Tuesday,
terming them dangerous to the
betterment, security and welfare
of the United States.
Mansfield warned that secret
organizations at both extremes of
the political spectrum wanted to
“divide, disrupt and subvert in
ternally” the country.
The Montana Democrat called
on the nation to ignore extremists
and support President Kennedy’s
foreign policy.
“WHAT HK NEEDS is a united
nation behind him, not neighbor
against neighbor or brother
against brother or American
against American, not suspicion
and discontent and discord, but
unity,” Mansfield declared.
“I think there is a place in this
country for true conservatives,”
Mansfield said in a television in
terview.
“But I’m afraid that either the
extreme right or extreme left are
dangerous to the betterment, to
the security, and the welfare of
the country, and can do more
harm than good,” he added.
MANSFIELD SAID extreme
right wingers were dangerous be
cause they found “fault with the
people of the country; they be
come suspicious of their neigh
bors: they show a lack of confi
dence in the man who is in charge
of internal security—J. Edgar
Hoover and the FBI.”
Mansfield said he believed ex
tremists were enjoying a limited
success but that the country as
a whole was following what he
termed Kennedy’s politically mod
erate leadership.
TURNING to one of Kennedy’s
main proposals, medical care for
the elderly under Social Security,
Mansfield called on the American
Medical Association to “wake up
to the fact that conditions in the
world are changing, and that even
such a great organization as the
AMA must change with it.”
