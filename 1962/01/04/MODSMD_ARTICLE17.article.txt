## Tough Battle with Congress Shapes Up for JFK in 1962 
### FRANK ELEAZER 
WASHINGTON (UPD—As far
as his relations with Congress are
concerned, 1962 already shapes up
as the year when President Ken
nedy can look back and reflect
that 1961 was the year when he
never had it so good.
For one thing, the honeymoon
is over. For another, Speaker
Sam Rayburn is dead. For a third,
some of the troubles Kennedy
might have had in 1961 were de
liberately put off until 1962 in
belief the legislative climate
might he improved then.

Now it looks like the weather
man goofed.
The Democratic 87th Congress
at its first session gave the new
Democratic president more of
what he asked than he probably
had any right to expect.
IT GAVE HIM $95 billion to
spend, more than any Congress
ever before gave a president ex
cept during war. It gave him all
he asked for defense, plus $266
million he didn’t want and said
he won’t spend. It approved an
out-of-this-world space budget in
cluding funds to shoot the moon
(and come home) by 1970 or
sooner.

The lawmakers raised social se
curity benefits for about 3.7 mil
lion widows and others. Men got
the option of retiring at age 62.
The minimum wage law was
broadened to cover about 3 mil
lion more workers and the hourly
wage floor was escalated toward
$1.25. Federal aid was provided
for children of unemployed fa
thers.
Kennedy’s prized Peace Corps,
which he created by executive
order, was set up in law. So was
the new disarmament agency ho
asked for. He won five-year plan
ning authority, subject to annual
appropriations, however, for his
foreign aid program and got 80
per cent of the first-year aid
funds he requested.
THE HOUSING BILL Congress
gave Kennedy in 1961 carried just
about all he asked in the way of
subsidies and other tools for bat
tling slums and spurring output
of new homes. He also got his
program for relief of depressed
areas and was handed extra funds
for clearing up water pollution
and making salt water fresh.
The late Speaker Rayburn had
a heavy hand in some of these
victories and had been counted
on to help win more of the big
ones in 1962. Medical care for the
aged, paid for through higher so
cial security taxes, now tops Ken
nedy’s domestic most-wanted list.
Rayburn saw that as a lost cause
the first time around and as a i’e
sult the fight was put off for a
year.
Also put off for a year were a
test on Kennedy’s plan to give
business a tax break on new plant
investment, and the five-cent
stamp and other postal increases
Kennedy sought to balance the
post office budget.
ON ANOTHER Kennedy “must”
bill—federal aid to build public
schools and help pay the teachers
—Rayburn did all he could, and
it wasn’t enough. The House in a
hot dispute over providing help
also for parochial schools knocked
public school aid in the head.
The people around Capitol Hill
who should know say now it can’t
be revived. Kennedy has intimat
ed he may try to revive it any
how. What he probably can get is
construction aid for colleges and
more scholarships.
The toughest fight of all will
come on lowering import duties.
Here too Rayburn’s influence
with the Ways & Means Commit
tee (for practical purposes he
picked the Democrats who con
trol it) will be missed, although
on this one the House itself will
be the real battleground.

Preliminary skirmishes befoi’e
other committees have demon
strated that when exports are
meant, everybody favors interna
tional trade. Imports, however,
are something else again.
KENNEDY'S contention is that
you can’t have one without the
other and he wants broad new
authority to negotiate to that end.
But a congressman whose con
stituents have found their tennis
ball market, for instance, dam
aged by imports isn’t likely to
see the issue Kennedy’s way, and
it is hard to find a congressional
district where some product isn’t
competing with a similar product
—frequently cheaper—brought in
from abroad.

If all that isn’t trouble enough

Kennedy can lie awake nights re
calling how simple things were
when the House had one boss and
that boss was Rayburn. This he
can do without any reflection on
Rep. John W. McCormack, who
takes Rayburn’s gavel. Any suc
cessor to any veteran speaker
will be weak by comparison.

THERE is, of course, also the
Senate. On the domestic front it
didn’t, and won’t, give Kennedy
too much concern. On the world
front, however, Senators enjoy
remarkable vision and hindsight
of at least 20-20. Kennedy can
count on hearing at length about
his misjudgments, if any, abroad.
And 1962 looks like a year when
any president would be a safe bet
to make some.

ever before gave a president ex
cept during war. It gave him all
he asked for defense, plus $266
million he didn’t want and said
he won’t spend. It approved an
out-of-this-world space budget in
cluding funds to shoot the moon
(and come home) by 1970 or
sooner.

The lawmakers raised social se
curity benefits for about 3.7 mil
lion widows and others. Men got
the option of retiring at age 62.
The minimum wage law was
broadened to cover about 3 mil
lion more workers and the hourly
wage floor was escalated toward
$1.25. Federal aid was provided
for children of unemployed fa
thers.
Kennedy’s prized Peace Corps,
which he created by executive
order, was set up in law. So was
the new disarmament agency ho
asked for. He won five-year plan
ning authority, subject to annual
appropriations, however, for his
foreign aid program and got 80
per cent of the first-year aid
funds he requested.
THE HOUSING BILL Congress
gave Kennedy in 1961 carried just
about all he asked in the way of
subsidies and other tools for bat
tling slums and spurring output
of new homes. He also got his
program for relief of depressed
areas and was handed extra funds
for clearing up water pollution
and making salt water fresh.
The late Speaker Rayburn had
a heavy hand in some of these
victories and had been counted
on to help win more of the big
ones in 1962. Medical care for the
aged, paid for through higher so
cial security taxes, now tops Ken
nedy’s domestic most-wanted list.
Rayburn saw that as a lost cause
the first time around and as a i’e
sult the fight was put off for a
year.
Also put off for a year were a
test on Kennedy’s plan to give
business a tax break on new plant
investment, and the five-cent
stamp and other postal increases
Kennedy sought to balance the
post office budget.
ON ANOTHER Kennedy “must”
bill—federal aid to build public
schools and help pay the teachers
—Rayburn did all he could, and
it wasn’t enough. The House in a
hot dispute over providing help
also for parochial schools knocked
public school aid in the head.
The people around Capitol Hill
who should know say now it can’t
be revived. Kennedy has intimat
ed he may try to revive it any
how. What he probably can get is
construction aid for colleges and
more scholarships.
The toughest fight of all will
come on lowering import duties.
Here too Rayburn’s influence
with the Ways & Means Commit
tee (for practical purposes he
picked the Democrats who con
trol it) will be missed, although
on this one the House itself will
be the real battleground.

Preliminary skirmishes befoi’e
other committees have demon
strated that when exports are
meant, everybody favors interna
tional trade. Imports, however,
are something else again.
KENNEDY'S contention is that
you can’t have one without the
other and he wants broad new
authority to negotiate to that end.
But a congressman whose con
stituents have found their tennis
ball market, for instance, dam
aged by imports isn’t likely to
see the issue Kennedy’s way, and
it is hard to find a congressional
district where some product isn’t
competing with a similar product
—frequently cheaper—brought in
from abroad.

If all that isn’t trouble enough

Kennedy can lie awake nights re
calling how simple things were
when the House had one boss and
that boss was Rayburn. This he
can do without any reflection on
Rep. John W. McCormack, who
takes Rayburn’s gavel. Any suc
cessor to any veteran speaker
will be weak by comparison.

THERE is, of course, also the
Senate. On the domestic front it
didn’t, and won’t, give Kennedy
too much concern. On the world
front, however, Senators enjoy
remarkable vision and hindsight
of at least 20-20. Kennedy can
count on hearing at length about
his misjudgments, if any, abroad.
And 1962 looks like a year when
any president would be a safe bet
to make some.
WASHINGTON (UPD—As far
as his relations with Congress are
concerned, 1962 already shapes up
as the year when President Ken
nedy can look back and reflect
that 1961 was the year when he
never had it so good.
For one thing, the honeymoon
is over. For another, Speaker
Sam Rayburn is dead. For a third,
some of the troubles Kennedy
might have had in 1961 were de
liberately put off until 1962 in
belief the legislative climate
might he improved then.

Now it looks like the weather
man goofed.

ning authority, subject to annual
appropriations, however, for his
foreign aid program and got 80
per cent of the first-year aid
funds he requested.
THE HOUSING BILL Congress
gave Kennedy in 1961 carried just
about all he asked in the way of
subsidies and other tools for bat
tling slums and spurring output
of new homes. He also got his
program for relief of depressed
areas and was handed extra funds
for clearing up water pollution
and making salt water fresh.
The late Speaker Rayburn had
a heavy hand in some of these
victories and had been counted
on to help win more of the big
ones in 1962. Medical care for the
aged, paid for through higher so
cial security taxes, now tops Ken
nedy’s domestic most-wanted list.
Rayburn saw that as a lost cause
the first time around and as a i’e
sult the fight was put off for a
year.
Also put off for a year were a
test on Kennedy’s plan to give
business a tax break on new plant
investment, and the five-cent
stamp and other postal increases
Kennedy sought to balance the
post office budget.
ON ANOTHER Kennedy “must”
bill—federal aid to build public
schools and help pay the teachers
—Rayburn did all he could, and
it wasn’t enough. The House in a
hot dispute over providing help
also for parochial schools knocked
public school aid in the head.
The people around Capitol Hill
who should know say now it can’t
be revived. Kennedy has intimat
ed he may try to revive it any
how. What he probably can get is
construction aid for colleges and
more scholarships.
The toughest fight of all will
come on lowering import duties.
Here too Rayburn’s influence
with the Ways & Means Commit
tee (for practical purposes he
picked the Democrats who con
trol it) will be missed, although
on this one the House itself will
be the real battleground.

Preliminary skirmishes befoi’e
other committees have demon
strated that when exports are
meant, everybody favors interna
tional trade. Imports, however,
are something else again.
KENNEDY'S contention is that
you can’t have one without the
other and he wants broad new
authority to negotiate to that end.
But a congressman whose con
stituents have found their tennis
ball market, for instance, dam
aged by imports isn’t likely to
see the issue Kennedy’s way, and
it is hard to find a congressional
district where some product isn’t
competing with a similar product
—frequently cheaper—brought in
from abroad.

If all that isn’t trouble enough

Kennedy can lie awake nights re
calling how simple things were
when the House had one boss and
that boss was Rayburn. This he
can do without any reflection on
Rep. John W. McCormack, who
takes Rayburn’s gavel. Any suc
cessor to any veteran speaker
will be weak by comparison.

THERE is, of course, also the
Senate. On the domestic front it
didn’t, and won’t, give Kennedy
too much concern. On the world
front, however, Senators enjoy
remarkable vision and hindsight
of at least 20-20. Kennedy can
count on hearing at length about
his misjudgments, if any, abroad.
And 1962 looks like a year when
any president would be a safe bet
to make some.
WASHINGTON (UPD—As far
as his relations with Congress are
concerned, 1962 already shapes up
as the year when President Ken
nedy can look back and reflect
that 1961 was the year when he
never had it so good.
For one thing, the honeymoon
is over. For another, Speaker
Sam Rayburn is dead. For a third,
some of the troubles Kennedy
might have had in 1961 were de
liberately put off until 1962 in
belief the legislative climate
might he improved then.

Now it looks like the weather
man goofed.
The Democratic 87th Congress
at its first session gave the new
Democratic president more of
what he asked than he probably
had any right to expect.
IT GAVE HIM $95 billion to
spend, more than any Congress
ever before gave a president ex
cept during war. It gave him all
he asked for defense, plus $266
million he didn’t want and said
he won’t spend. It approved an
out-of-this-world space budget in
cluding funds to shoot the moon
(and come home) by 1970 or
sooner.

The lawmakers raised social se
curity benefits for about 3.7 mil
lion widows and others. Men got
the option of retiring at age 62.
The minimum wage law was
broadened to cover about 3 mil
lion more workers and the hourly
wage floor was escalated toward
$1.25. Federal aid was provided
for children of unemployed fa
thers.
Kennedy’s prized Peace Corps,
which he created by executive
order, was set up in law. So was
the new disarmament agency ho
asked for. He won five-year plan
ning authority, subject to annual
appropriations, however, for his
foreign aid program and got 80
per cent of the first-year aid
