# Below Average Given College Tryouts in Md.

COLLEGE PARK, Md. (UPl)—What should the nation’s over
flowing universities and colleges do about high school students who
come knocking on their doors with less than a “C” average?
The University of Maryland recently inaugurated a program
whicli has attracted the interest of many private and state-operated
colleges. Its solution:
Require below average students to pass special summer courses
before being granted admission.
THE UNIVERSITY OF Maryland’s rigorous program lasts for
six weeks. Students are required to enroll in two courses; English,
and a choice of government and politics or sociology. Engineering
students have a third choice of math.
Dr. George Marx, director of the summer program and an
assistant professor of education at the university, said that to qualify
for admission the students have to pass both courses with at least a
“C” in one.
Of 359 students who took the courses last summer, only slightly
more than 50 per cent passed them satisfactorily.
One hundred and seventy-six qualified for admission out of the
original 359, with 144 students being rejected. Thirty-nine dropped
out before completion of the program.
“UNDER OUR FORMER arrangement, on-trial students were
admitted and only one in six survived after two years,” Dr. R. Lee
Hornbake, vice president for academic affairs, said in an interview.
“This is expensive and frustrating to the student and the university.”
No more on-trial students—those admitted dubiously pending
attainment of certain grades—will be admitted to the university, said
Hornbake. He said the pre-college summer session is designed to
separate those students capable of doing college work from those
who would not be able to finish a four-year program.
He explained that the university is trying to develop “an admis
sions policy of graduation expectation.” The new summer session
should greatly increase the number who successfully complete their
college requirements and graduate, he said.
OTHER UNIVERSITIES HAVE shown an active interest in the
idea. Oklahoma State University was one of the first to make
inquiries.
“We’ve heard from every college in Georgia in the state univer
sity system,” Hornbake said. “We sent information to each board of
trustee member of these colleges.”
A comprehensive report on how to set up such a program is
available upon request from the University of Maryland. It was
compiled to satisfy requests from colleges interested in initiating a
similar program.
