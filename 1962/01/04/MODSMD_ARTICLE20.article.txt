# Hot Stanford Basketball Squad Ready for Tough Duck Attack
## 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford goes into its weekend
series with the Oregon Ducks
riding on the crest of a six-game
winning streak.
The Indians polished off an all
star Hawaiian service team Tues
day to finish undefeated in four
games in the Hawaiian Naval
Basketball Tournament. This
coupled with impressive wins
over St. Louis and Nebraska
should give the Indians the favor
ite role against Oregon.
BUT IT doesn’t. Oregon rallied
from a slow start to finish second
in the Far West Classic to mighty
Oregon State. The Webfoot’s high
scoring forward Charlie Warren
was the most valuable man in the
tourney, and his shooting eye is
reputed to be primed for Stanford.
Stanford’s eight wins have been
a team effort. Each game a dif
ferent man came through to
spark the victory.
Against USF it was John Wind
sor’s shooting. Tom Dose, the
most spectacular Indian to date,
potted 22 to lead Stanford to vic
tory. Dose was also outstanding
in Stanford’s two losses to Oregon
State, tenth ranked team in the
country according to one wire
service.
HOLLIS MOORE’S shooting in
the second half led Stanford past
St. Louis. Doug Clemetson’s first
half marksmanship and Darrell
Sutherland’s clutch second half
performance smashed Nebraska.
In the Naval Tourney, balanced
scoring with the hallmark of the
Indians,
Sutherland has been the most
consistent Indian scorer lately,
with 24 points against Nebraska
and an 18-point performance at
Hawaii. Moore has been hitting

(he hoop regularly and Dose con
sistently makes the double scoring
figures.
Any man in the Stanford lineup
or on the bench can score on any
given play and the fact that the
opponents cannot key on any one
man Is what makes Stanford this
year different from the Stanford
teams of the past ten years, which
could be stopped fairly regularly

by keying on one top performer.
The Stanford freshmen play a
pair of games this weekend. They
play Moffett Field on Friday eve
ning and oppose Menlo College
on Saturday.

Basketball Tournament. This
coupled with impressive wins
over St. Louis and Nebraska
should give the Indians the favor
ite role against Oregon.
BUT IT doesn’t. Oregon rallied
from a slow start to finish second
in the Far West Classic to mighty
Oregon State. The Webfoot’s high
scoring forward Charlie Warren
was the most valuable man in the
tourney, and his shooting eye is
reputed to be primed for Stanford.
Stanford’s eight wins have been
a team effort. Each game a dif
ferent man came through to
spark the victory.
Against USF it was John Wind
sor’s shooting. Tom Dose, the
most spectacular Indian to date,
potted 22 to lead Stanford to vic
tory. Dose was also outstanding
in Stanford’s two losses to Oregon
State, tenth ranked team in the
country according to one wire
service.
HOLLIS MOORE’S shooting in
the second half led Stanford past
St. Louis. Doug Clemetson’s first
half marksmanship and Darrell
Sutherland’s clutch second half
performance smashed Nebraska.
In the Naval Tourney, balanced
scoring with the hallmark of the
Indians,
Sutherland has been the most
consistent Indian scorer lately,
with 24 points against Nebraska
and an 18-point performance at
Hawaii. Moore has been hitting

(he hoop regularly and Dose con
sistently makes the double scoring
figures.
Any man in the Stanford lineup
or on the bench can score on any
given play and the fact that the
opponents cannot key on any one
man Is what makes Stanford this
year different from the Stanford
teams of the past ten years, which
could be stopped fairly regularly

by keying on one top performer.
The Stanford freshmen play a
pair of games this weekend. They
play Moffett Field on Friday eve
ning and oppose Menlo College
on Saturday.

Stanford goes into its weekend
series with the Oregon Ducks
riding on the crest of a six-game
winning streak.
The Indians polished off an all
star Hawaiian service team Tues
day to finish undefeated in four
games in the Hawaiian Naval
Basketball Tournament. This
coupled with impressive wins
over St. Louis and Nebraska
should give the Indians the favor
