# SRI Establishes New Branch Office in Japan
## 
### 
Stanford Research Institute has
announced the establishment of a
new branch office in Japan. Dr.
Carsten Steffens, senior scientist
and research coordinator at the
Institute, left last week for Tokyo
to become director of the office.

“ For several years the Institute
has maintained close contacts
with Japanese business, industry,
and scientific research organiza
tions.” said E. Finley Carter, SRI
president. “We are greatly im
pressed with the economic and in
dustrial development of that
country and believe there is much
to be gained by a more active ex
change of information and ideas
between the two nations. The new
Institute operation in Japan will
assist in this effort.”
THE Japanese economy has
grown rapidly during the post
war years, averaging about 9 per
cent per year. The Japanese gov
ernment has set a goal of doubl
ing national production during
the next 10 yeai’s.
The purpose of the new SRI of
fice, according to Steffens, will
be to improve research services to
Institute clients in the United
States, in Japan and also in Eu
rope.
“For Institute clients In the
United States and Europe, we
should now be able to provide
quicker and better information on
economic conditions and technical
developments in Japan,” he said,
“while at the same time providing
Japanese companies with infor
mation on services and capabili
ties available through United
States and European organiza
tions.”
“We hope through the new SRI
office,” Steffens continued “to
augment the already rapid devel
opment of common interests of
U.S. and Japanese industry.”
OPENING of SRl’s office in Ja
pan brings to five the countries

outside the United States in which
SRI maintains permanent repre
sentation. Three are in Europe—

Switzerland, Italy and the United
Kingdom. An SRI representative
also resides in Ontario, Canada.
In addition, SRI project groups
are maintained in Sweden, India,
Pakistan and Argentina.
Steffens received his A.B. de
gree from Syracuse University in
1930 and the Ph.D. from Cali
fornia Institute of Technology in
1934. Ho was with the General
Printing Ink Corporation (now
