Firemen put out a fire caused

Prof. James phoned an alarm
to the Stanford Fire Department
at 5:45 a.m. Mrs. James said they
had a fire going in the fireplace
of their home at 526 Alvarado

up early in the morning to find
the house filled with smoke.
An undetermined amount of
damage was done to the living
room walls and beams under
