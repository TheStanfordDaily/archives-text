# Try Out Now For One-Acts
## 
### 
Tryouts will continue tonight
and Friday for Ram’s Head Pro
ductions’ 1962 Winter One-Acts,
to be performed Feb. 9, 10, 16 and
17. The tryouts will be held in
Memorial Auditorium from 7:30
to 9:30 p.m. Information will be
available in the back hall.

The three plays offer a variety
of acting opportunities. “Friends
of the Universe,” by Judy Skin
ner, is a comedy about a girl and
her parents, and their experiences
with integration in the home.

Dave Kirk’s play, “The Inquisi
tion,’’ is a stark drama concerning
the motives and mental anguish
of one of the Inquisitors. As the
plot unfolds, the ways in which
he destroys his integrity and the
lives of those around him are re
vealed.

The third play, “As I Was Go
ing to St. Ives,” by Judy Shrader
is an English murder mystery
with a trick ending.
At the same time that acting
tryouts are being conducted, inter
views will be held for crew and
staff members. All students, with
or without theater experience, are
encouraged to attend.
