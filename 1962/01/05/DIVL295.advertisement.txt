PIONEERING
Somewhere out there, beyond the realm of man’s present
understanding, lies an idea. A concept. A truth.
Gradually, as it comes under the concentration of
disciplined minds, it will become clear, refined, mas
tered, This is the lonely art of pioneering.
In the Bell System, pioneering often results in major
breakthroughs. Planning the use of satellites as vehicles
for world-wide communications is one. Another is the
Optical Gas Maser, an invention which may allow a
controlled beam of light to carry vast numbers of telephone
calls, TV shows, and data messages.
Breakthroughs like these will one day bring exciting
new telephone and communications service to you.. The
responsibility of providing these sendees will be in the
hands of Che people who work for your local telephone
company. Among them are the engineering, administrative
and operat ions personnel who make your telephone service
the finest In the world.
