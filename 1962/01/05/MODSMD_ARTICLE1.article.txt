# U.S. to Resume Dominican Ties
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The
United States moved Thursday to
resume diplomatic relations with
the Dominican Republic and to
grant financial aid to the succes
sor regime of slain dictator Ra
fael Trujillo.

The twin U.S. moves were made
as the Organization of American
States voted to remove ail diplo
matic and economic sanctions
which were imposed on the Do
minican Republic in 1960.
Ever since Trujillo’s assassina
tion, (he OAS has been studying
whether to lift the sanctions. It
did so in view of the fact that a
seven-man council of state, which
includes representatives of the op
position, took office in Santo Do
mingo Jan. 1.

The vote to lift sanctions was
20-0, with Cuba abstaining.
THE CUBAN alternate delegate
to the OAS, Carlos S. Chain, said
he abstained on the vote because
the council government in the re
public now is “Trujilloism with
out Trujillo.”

Shortly after the OAS voted to
lift the hemispheric-wide quaran
tine of the island republic, U.S.
officials said this country already
was moving to restore diplomatic
ties.

The British Embassy in Santo
Domingo, which has represented
U.S. interests since the diplomatic
break 17 months ago, was author
ized to present a note announc
ing this decision to the govern
ment of President Joaquin Ba
laguer.

U.S. officials said they expect
ed the Dominican Republic to
agree Friday, or by Saturday at
the latest, to the restoration of
contacts. John C. Hill, U.S. con
sul general in Santo Domingo,
has been named to serve as
charge d’affaires until on ambas
sador is named and accepted.
EARLIER the White House an
nounced that a foreign aid mis
sion headed by Teodoro Moscoso,
assistant administrator of the
Agency for International Develop
ment, would leave for Santo Do
mingo Sunday to discuss possible
U.S. financial support under the
alliance for progress program.
The resumption of relations will
mean an immediate cash benefit
of millions of dollars for the Do
minican Republic. It now' will be
allocated an additional quota of
421,000 tons of sugar in the U.S.
market which it will sell for about
$45..100,000, compared with $l9
million it otherwise would get in
the w'orld market.
This will result from the fact
that the country now becomes eli
gible to share in the “windfall”
allocation of U.S. sugar purchases
to make up the cancelled Cuban
quota.
The 21-member OAS voted in

August, 1960, to impose diploma
tic and economic sanctions
against the regime of dictator Ra
fael Trujillo, who had been ac
cused of plotting to kill Venezue
lan President Romulo Betancourt.
AT THURSDAY’S OAS council
meeting, it was the Venezuelan
delegate who first proposed that
the sanctions be removed. The
Dominican Republic, he said, had
now ceased to be a threat to the
peace of the Western Hemisphere.
U.S. Ambassador DeLesseps
Morrison congratulated the peo
ple and the government of the Do
minican Republic “for finding a
solution to their difficult prob
lems in the best tradition of dem
ocratic evolution.’’
