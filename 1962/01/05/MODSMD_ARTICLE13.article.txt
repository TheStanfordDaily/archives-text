# Shell Raps Brown For High Tax Rate
## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
“I have seen us (California)
going progressively deeper into
basic socialism during my five
state legislative terms,” was GOP
gubernatorial candidate Joe
Shell’s analysis yesterday.
In an evaluation of the Brown-
Unruh administration, Shell de
clared himself “a conservative
candidate for governor” in the
campus address made as part of
his whirl-wind campaign tour.
“Conservatism is the belief in
the right of the individual citizen
to own and develop private prop
erty without undue interference
from the government.” stated
candidate Shell, who will buck
Richard Nixon and Goodwin
Knight in the GOP gubernatorial

primary.

Shell is basing his campaign upon
the need for reduction of taxes
which have been leading Califor
nia “down the road to the destina
tion of a welfare state. No
thoughtful person wants to be
come mired in the slough of des
pondency and cynicism.’’ Shell
viewed California’s high tax rate
as knocking the small business
man out of business, yielding un
employment, the welfare state,
and “loss of the free enterprise
system. Our system of represent
ative government grew out of free
enterprise; if wo lose free enter
prise we will lose our represent
ative government.’
A contracting rate of business
expansion in the state was cited
as evidence of the effects of tax
ation.

Shell’s approach to cutting the
tax problem is “the elimination
of the fat—the unnecessary ex
penses—in the California budget.”
Shell presented the claim the Gov
ernor Edmund Brown is not able
to do this. “You can’t use the blue
pencil on the budget while having
political ambitions, seeking re
election; each blue line antagon
izes another pressure group. My
only political aspiration is to have
the blue pencil in hand for four
years.”

SHELL’S approach to cutting
expenses is cutting unnecessary
stale positions, and putting in de
partment heads who are “not try
ing to spend in excess.” Shell
evaluated the Brown administra
tion in this aspect by commenting,
“You can pick the men in the ad
ministration who won’t be around
much longer by the soundness of
their views."
“California must elect a candi
date who promises no new tax
programs in the state. The Brown
administration is trying basic,
radical socialism.” Evidence of
this according to Shell, is the
minimum wage bill “which was
actually a wage-fixing bill.” Shell
summarized the Brown adminis
tration as “incompetent, indeci
sive, and extravagant.”
I n reviewing hi s election
chances, Shell stated “I am not
well enough known now, but I
am working through the grass
roots, the precinct level.”
“There is only one vehicle by
which we can set things right in
California and the United States
■ —the Republican Party. For this
reason, I am not a member of the
John Birch Society.’ Shell stands
as a supporter of outlawing the
Communist Party in California,
and utilizing loyalty oaths.
SHELL HAS been a member of
the State Legislature since 1953,
and has been floor leader in the
Assembly for the last three years.
His campaign support financially
and with volunteers has been
growing with speculation that
Knight, a known antagonist of
Nixon’s political plans, would
throw his support to Shell, should
Knight’s illness keep him from
the race.
Shell runs on the need for a
“stable economy sending to Sac
ramento a Governor who will re
verse the present socialistic think
ing in the Executive Department;
electing a Governor who will take
positive steps to keep California
from becoming a welfare State
before it’s too late.”


CONSERVATIVES Joe Shell, GOP candidate for the California gov
ernorship and Dick Weinig, Conservative Caucus chairman, discuss
the coming Republican Primary battle among contenders Goodwin
Knight, Richard Nixon, and Shell.
