# Arts in America Need Federal Aid
## 
### 
The financially desperate position of America’s performing
artists was outlined to a Congressional subcommittee in San Fran
cisco recently. The picture painted was not an encouraging one.
Even in The City, which prides itself on being different from
the rest of American cities in that it presents a modicum of cul
ture, there is cause for gloom. The outstanding Actor’s Workshop
is in a battle for survival to raise $39,000 to continue operating.
What is astonishing is that such an essential cultural asset to the
Bay Area and the nation must beg for such a small sum—and not
be assured of raising it.
This is only one example of the plight of the arts in the U.S.
Testimony revealed the majority of American musicians, painters,
poets, actors and other artists are abysmally paid, and often cannot
devote full time to their are because they must take another job
in order to cat. Others quit their field entirely. All of this in the
world’s most affluent society.
One of the two members of the subcommittee which held hear
ings in San Francisco told the press: “There isn’t a chance in the
world Congress will do a thing about the arts. We’ve too many
other things to think about. If communities want culture, they
should pay for it themselves.”
This, it seems to us, is a fairly typical American viewpoint. If it
holds sway for much longer, however, there will be very little
American culture left, and Congress will be able to take care of
the “other things” without worrying about the arts.
Clearly, as the testimony to the committee in The City and else
where brought out, the arts in America need federal support. A
nation without a thriving culture and large body of artists wotdd
hardly be worth calling a nation. There is more to life than auto
mobiles, TV sets, deep freezes and the rest of the material goods
which are so worshipped in our society. American artists are as
talented as those elsewhere, and the U.S. has much to offer the
world in cidture.
But most of those trying to live by the arts obviously need
federal financial aid, This is a field where a relatively small amount
of money could do a tremendous amount of good. There is no
reason, for instance, why the President couldn’t announce that the
U.S. was diverting the $6 million one Polaris missile costs to estab
lishing a national commission on the arts. This commission could
launch a program to encourage and give financial backing to
students wishing to go into the arts, while at the same time aiding
deserving artists and communities which find it difficult or im
possible to meet the financial obligations of supporting the arts.
Admittedly, such a move would be different and unusual in
our age. But it would be effective and would indicate to the rest
of the world that the U.S. does realize what is important in the
long run and is willing to spend money on something which will
have much more meaning to the future of this nation than weapons
will.
