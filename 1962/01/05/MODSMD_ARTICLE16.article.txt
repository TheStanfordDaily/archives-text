## The
						Working Alliance 
### 
Although the news from the re
cent Paris meetings has been
meager and not particularly en
lightening, it looks as if we have
learned at least one of the facts
of life about our alliance. It is
that all of the Allies cannot move
together, hand in hand and unani
mously, but that one among them
must take the lead, going back to
’' n o:hers for approval and con
sent.

The past six months have dem
onstrated that the four Western
allies cannot negotiate as a team
which will agree theoretically in
advance on all of the questions
which may arise in a practical
negotiation. In the real world
someone has to begin to negotiate
to find out precisely what the ne
gotiation is to be about. It is a
mirage to expect the four West
ern powers to guess correctly in
advance just what Khrushchev
will ask and just what he will
concede, and to have an agreed
“position” on every guess.
IN PARIS the meetings of the
foreign ministers and of the
NATO Council seemed to have
concluded that while the Western
Big Four cannot negotiate now
with the Soviet Union, the United
States can take the lead in talking
with the Soviet government.
There is, of course, a big differ
ence between “talking” and “ne
gotiating,” the difference being
that in a negotiation the negoti
ator can accept a proposition with
reasonable certainty that the gov
ernment will approve. In “talk
ing,” it is allowable to work out
an agreement but not to conclude
without fresh instructions from
the partners concerned.
On the whole, this is the most
sensible way to go about the busi
ness. Even if the French govern
ment were willing to attend a for
eign ministers’ meeting in the
near future, it would almost cer

tainly not be a good thing to try
to deal with the Berlin question
in a formal foreign ministers’
meeting. Experience has shown
how undesirable are such meet
ings with the large delegations,
with the enormous press corps,
with the long-winded speeches de
livered for publicity purposes,
and with the destructive and ma
licious leaks.
If negotiation is to be produc
tive, it will have to be done in pri
vate—more or less in the spirit
and the manner of the Rusk- Gro
myko conversations during the
autumn. The four foreign minis
ters can meet after there is sub
stantial agreement on a working
draft. They will only muddle
things if they meet before there
is a working draft.
AS FOR A SUMMIT meeting,
that should be contemplated only
after a settlement is worked out
and signed and ratified.
Berlin is, of course, not the only
question on which the Western
alliance has to find ways of co
ordinating its policy. There are
all the other areas of international
conflict, especially in Asia, the
Middle East and Africa. It is not
possible to do what Gen. de Gaulle
asked President Eisenhower to
do, which is to decide all world
questions by the unanimous
agreement of Britain, France, and
the United States. Such a global
directorate would cause more
trouble by arousing suspicion and
jealousy than it would have the
power to cure. The Western allies
will have to learn that they must
work together as much as they
can, that they must disagree and
go their separate ways as little as
they can. For their marriage, al
though not always perfect, is in
dissoluble.
