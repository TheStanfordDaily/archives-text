# MOVIE REVIEW
## Man Who Wagged His Tail,' 'Pocketful of Miracles' Scored 
### ALAN ROSENTHAL 
It really would be so much
simpler for the critic if he had a
formula classification for films.
He could then merely list a num
ber and the reader would know
everything about the film.
Formula “one,” for example,
would be rich girl protending
she’s poor meets poor guy pre
tending he’s rich. Formula “two”
would be rich girl pretending
she’s poor meets rich guy pretend
ing he’s poor. And so on.
Using (his system, Frank Cap
ra’s “A Pocketful of Miracles” at
the Park Theatre in Menlo Park,
fits in formula “17,” poor New
York street beggar, Apple Annie
(Bette Davis) pretends she is rich
so as to get her daughter accepted
in marriage by the son of a Span
ish count.

There are naturally subdivi
sions to the formulae indicating
style. Thus 17 “K” tells us that
Capra’s film is in colour (no doubt
miraclevision) noisy, slick, rou
tine, forgettable and attempts to
be funny. In other words lush,
plush and mush!
OF COURSE IF the critic was
really energetic he might add that
Annie sells lucky apples to the
Dude (Glenn Ford) which keeps
his gangster’s luck intact. Because
Annie is his safeguard the Dude
naturally has to get his mob to
pretend to act as society people
in order to impress the count, as
well as finding a swell looking
guy to masquerade as Annie’s
husband.
We also know that according to
the formula the Dude, who is
really a nice guy and wears daz
zling white shirt fronts that never
get stained when his girl friend
rests her Max Factor face upon
them, must have two cronies. One
must be a smart Brooklyn wise
cracker, the other a dumb stooge
who provide the laughs.
You see this is meant to be a
funny film, in fact it is adver
tised as “The Comedy of the
Year.” Undoubtedly they mean
1933 when Capra made the first
version of this picture under the
title “Lady for a Day.”
ALL THE GANGSTERS have
funny names like Stiff Arm Sam,
Joy Boy and Junior which tells
you that Damon Runyon had a
hand in (his somewhere. Even the
Dude’s moll (gal, dame, judy,
doll) has a name like Queenie, but
she deserves it because she is so
good and always trying to take
the Dude away from his millions
to a better life in Maryland.
Capra was once a good director.
His latest effort is miserable.
Bette Davis and Glenn Ford are
miscast, the action slow and the
joke situations painfully obvious.
Some people laughed some of the
time. See it if you’ve got nothing

better to do.
THE SECOND FEATURE “The
Man Who Wagged His Tail” fea
tures Peter Ustinov. Ustinov is
undoubtedly one of the finest tal
ents to emerge from England
since the war. He excels as writer,
wit and play director and is a fine
actor in his own genre . . . which
is certainly not that of a cruel
landlord in a Brooklyn immigrant
area who is turned into a dog un
til he sees the error of his ways
and gets someone to love him.
How Ustinov was ever lured
into this incredibly had Spanish-
Italian production is beyond me.
My theory is that he got struck
by the drunken driver of a baby
carriage whilst crossing a London
street in the fog and made the
film whilst suffering from loss
of his critical faculties.
The idea isn’t bad, but it calls
for a lightness of touch and heart
in the direction that is completely
missing. There are too many bru
tal and ugly scenes, particularly
with children which are out of
keeping with the mood. A film
like this should take wings, but
instead it crawls along like a dys
peptic crab.

IF THERE was any directing in
volved then I am unaware of the
fact, but at least seven people are
listed as responsible for the
screenplay. My memory is bad
so they won’t be embarrassed by
my naming them. The acting is
wooden and the characters per
form as if with a gun in their
back.

By far the best thing on the
whole program is the preview of
Hollywood’s “The Magic Sword.”
You are invited to see double
headed dragons, fiendish magici
ans, midget men, mighty mon
sters and nude drowning hero
ines. And all this with the modest
comment that “there has been
nothing like this since the world
began.” Wow, Man! Now we’re
talking ! !

comment that “there has been

talking ! !
It really would be so much
simpler for the critic if he had a
formula classification for films.
He could then merely list a num
ber and the reader would know
everything about the film.
Formula “one,” for example,
would be rich girl protending
she’s poor meets poor guy pre
tending he’s rich. Formula “two”
would be rich girl pretending
she’s poor meets rich guy pretend
ing he’s poor. And so on.
Using (his system, Frank Cap
ra’s “A Pocketful of Miracles” at
the Park Theatre in Menlo Park,
fits in formula “17,” poor New
York street beggar, Apple Annie
(Bette Davis) pretends she is rich
so as to get her daughter accepted
in marriage by the son of a Span
ish count.

There are naturally subdivi
sions to the formulae indicating
style. Thus 17 “K” tells us that
Capra’s film is in colour (no doubt
miraclevision) noisy, slick, rou
tine, forgettable and attempts to
be funny. In other words lush,
plush and mush!
OF COURSE IF the critic was
really energetic he might add that
Annie sells lucky apples to the
Dude (Glenn Ford) which keeps
his gangster’s luck intact. Because
Annie is his safeguard the Dude
naturally has to get his mob to
pretend to act as society people
in order to impress the count, as
well as finding a swell looking
guy to masquerade as Annie’s
husband.
We also know that according to
the formula the Dude, who is
really a nice guy and wears daz
zling white shirt fronts that never
get stained when his girl friend
rests her Max Factor face upon
them, must have two cronies. One
must be a smart Brooklyn wise
cracker, the other a dumb stooge
who provide the laughs.
You see this is meant to be a
funny film, in fact it is adver
tised as “The Comedy of the
Year.” Undoubtedly they mean
1933 when Capra made the first
version of this picture under the
title “Lady for a Day.”
ALL THE GANGSTERS have
funny names like Stiff Arm Sam,
Joy Boy and Junior which tells
you that Damon Runyon had a
hand in (his somewhere. Even the
Dude’s moll (gal, dame, judy,
doll) has a name like Queenie, but
she deserves it because she is so
good and always trying to take
the Dude away from his millions
to a better life in Maryland.
Capra was once a good director.
His latest effort is miserable.
Bette Davis and Glenn Ford are
miscast, the action slow and the
joke situations painfully obvious.
Some people laughed some of the
time. See it if you’ve got nothing

better to do.

Man Who Wagged His Tail” fea
tures Peter Ustinov. Ustinov is
undoubtedly one of the finest tal
ents to emerge from England
since the war. He excels as writer,
wit and play director and is a fine
actor in his own genre . . . which
is certainly not that of a cruel
landlord in a Brooklyn immigrant
area who is turned into a dog un
til he sees the error of his ways
and gets someone to love him.
How Ustinov was ever lured
into this incredibly had Spanish-
Italian production is beyond me.
My theory is that he got struck
by the drunken driver of a baby
carriage whilst crossing a London
street in the fog and made the
film whilst suffering from loss
of his critical faculties.
The idea isn’t bad, but it calls
for a lightness of touch and heart
in the direction that is completely
missing. There are too many bru
tal and ugly scenes, particularly
with children which are out of
keeping with the mood. A film
like this should take wings, but
instead it crawls along like a dys
peptic crab.

IF THERE was any directing in
volved then I am unaware of the
fact, but at least seven people are
listed as responsible for the
screenplay. My memory is bad
so they won’t be embarrassed by
my naming them. The acting is
wooden and the characters per
form as if with a gun in their
back.

By far the best thing on the
whole program is the preview of
Hollywood’s “The Magic Sword.”

By far the best thing on the
whole program is the preview of
Hollywood’s “The Magic Sword.”
You are invited to see double
headed dragons, fiendish magici
ans, midget men, mighty mon
sters and nude drowning hero
ines. And all this with the modest
comment that “there has been
nothing like this since the world
began.” Wow, Man! Now we’re
talking ! !
It really would be so much
simpler for the critic if he had a
formula classification for films.
He could then merely list a num
ber and the reader would know
everything about the film.
Formula “one,” for example,
would be rich girl protending
she’s poor meets poor guy pre
tending he’s rich. Formula “two”
would be rich girl pretending
she’s poor meets rich guy pretend
ing he’s poor. And so on.
Using (his system, Frank Cap
ra’s “A Pocketful of Miracles” at
the Park Theatre in Menlo Park,
fits in formula “17,” poor New
York street beggar, Apple Annie
(Bette Davis) pretends she is rich
so as to get her daughter accepted
in marriage by the son of a Span
ish count.

There are naturally subdivi
sions to the formulae indicating
style. Thus 17 “K” tells us that
Capra’s film is in colour (no doubt
miraclevision) noisy, slick, rou
tine, forgettable and attempts to
be funny. In other words lush,
plush and mush!
OF COURSE IF the critic was
really energetic he might add that
Annie sells lucky apples to the
Dude (Glenn Ford) which keeps
his gangster’s luck intact. Because
Annie is his safeguard the Dude
naturally has to get his mob to
pretend to act as society people
in order to impress the count, as
well as finding a swell looking
guy to masquerade as Annie’s
husband.
We also know that according to
the formula the Dude, who is
really a nice guy and wears daz
zling white shirt fronts that never
get stained when his girl friend
rests her Max Factor face upon
them, must have two cronies. One
must be a smart Brooklyn wise
cracker, the other a dumb stooge
who provide the laughs.
You see this is meant to be a
funny film, in fact it is adver
tised as “The Comedy of the
Year.” Undoubtedly they mean
1933 when Capra made the first
version of this picture under the
title “Lady for a Day.”
ALL THE GANGSTERS have
funny names like Stiff Arm Sam,
Joy Boy and Junior which tells
you that Damon Runyon had a
hand in (his somewhere. Even the
Dude’s moll (gal, dame, judy,
doll) has a name like Queenie, but
she deserves it because she is so
good and always trying to take
the Dude away from his millions
to a better life in Maryland.
Capra was once a good director.
His latest effort is miserable.
Bette Davis and Glenn Ford are
miscast, the action slow and the
joke situations painfully obvious.
Some people laughed some of the
time. See it if you’ve got nothing

better to do.
THE SECOND FEATURE “The
Man Who Wagged His Tail” fea
tures Peter Ustinov. Ustinov is
undoubtedly one of the finest tal
ents to emerge from England
since the war. He excels as writer,
wit and play director and is a fine
actor in his own genre . . . which
is certainly not that of a cruel
landlord in a Brooklyn immigrant
area who is turned into a dog un
til he sees the error of his ways
and gets someone to love him.
How Ustinov was ever lured
into this incredibly had Spanish-
Italian production is beyond me.
My theory is that he got struck
by the drunken driver of a baby
carriage whilst crossing a London
street in the fog and made the
film whilst suffering from loss
of his critical faculties.
The idea isn’t bad, but it calls
for a lightness of touch and heart
in the direction that is completely
missing. There are too many bru
tal and ugly scenes, particularly
with children which are out of
keeping with the mood. A film
like this should take wings, but
instead it crawls along like a dys
peptic crab.

IF THERE was any directing in
volved then I am unaware of the
fact, but at least seven people are
listed as responsible for the
screenplay. My memory is bad
so they won’t be embarrassed by
my naming them. The acting is
wooden and the characters per
form as if with a gun in their
back.
