CUBA AND CASTRO, by Te

Reviewed by DOUGLAS WILMS
The behind-the-scenes story of
the Cuban revolution is told in
this compelling ami enlightening
book by Teresa Casuso, Fidel Cas
tro’s first press aide and former
delegate to the United Nations.
Recalling recent Cuban history
through a personal biography,
the author paints a detailed, per
sonal word portrait of Castro
and evaluates the factors that in
fluenced his revolution.
A close friend of Castro in his
days as a leader of Cuban exiles
in Mexico, Miss Casuso dispels
stories of Castro’s Communist
associations until late in his revo
lution, when American interests
were already allied against him.
MISS CASUSO DESCRIBES the
personal habits of Castro and his
haphazard manner of conducting
business, but defends his inten
tions and explains how the revo
lution might have successfully
brought freedom to Cuba.
Distortions and inaccuracies in
the press irritated Castro. Help
ing to trip a delicately balanced
Castro temperament, these dis
tortions were effective in proving
themselves true.
Castro is a brilliant fighter and
agitator in the eyes of his former
top aide. But the most difficult
problem for a natural fighter to
face, she analyzes, is administer
ing the peace.
“CUBA AND CASTRO” also
describes the part played by Cas
tro’s revolutionary associates in
his new government. These pres
ently influential, and often incom
petent, men and women would be
disenfranchised by the govern
ment they created if Castro ever
settled down to a calm adminis
tration.
In tracing Cuba’s history from
colonialism to imperialism and
dominance by ihe United States,
the author shows how many of
Cuba’s troubles stemmed from
U.S. manipulation of Cuba’s econ
omy and U.S. corruption of Cuban
politics through economic pres

sures and rewards.
Directing her book at the United
States, Teresa Casuso repeatedly
and convincingly tells us, “You

were responsible for the failure
of Cuban democracy, you caused
this disastrous revolution and you
led Fidel Castro to Communism.”

top aide. But the most difficult
problem for a natural fighter to
face, she analyzes, is administer
ing the peace.
“CUBA AND CASTRO” also
describes the part played by Cas
tro’s revolutionary associates in
his new government. These pres
ently influential, and often incom
petent, men and women would be
disenfranchised by the govern
ment they created if Castro ever
settled down to a calm adminis
tration.
In tracing Cuba’s history from
colonialism to imperialism and
dominance by ihe United States,
the author shows how many of
Cuba’s troubles stemmed from
U.S. manipulation of Cuba’s econ
omy and U.S. corruption of Cuban
politics through economic pres

sures and rewards.
Directing her book at the United
States, Teresa Casuso repeatedly
and convincingly tells us, “You

were responsible for the failure
of Cuban democracy, you caused
this disastrous revolution and you
led Fidel Castro to Communism.”

The behind-the-scenes story of
the Cuban revolution is told in
this compelling ami enlightening
book by Teresa Casuso, Fidel Cas
tro’s first press aide and former
delegate to the United Nations.
Recalling recent Cuban history
through a personal biography,
the author paints a detailed, per
sonal word portrait of Castro
and evaluates the factors that in
fluenced his revolution.
A close friend of Castro in his
days as a leader of Cuban exiles
in Mexico, Miss Casuso dispels
stories of Castro’s Communist
associations until late in his revo
lution, when American interests
were already allied against him.
MISS CASUSO DESCRIBES the
personal habits of Castro and his
haphazard manner of conducting
business, but defends his inten
tions and explains how the revo
lution might have successfully
brought freedom to Cuba.
Distortions and inaccuracies in
the press irritated Castro. Help
ing to trip a delicately balanced
Castro temperament, these dis
tortions were effective in proving
themselves true.
Castro is a brilliant fighter and
agitator in the eyes of his former
top aide. But the most difficult
problem for a natural fighter to
face, she analyzes, is administer
ing the peace.
