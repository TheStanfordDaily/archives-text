# Stanford Basketballers Host Webfoots

### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
A suntanned Stanford basket
ball team, recently returned to the
continental United States, plays
host to a rejuvenated Oregon to
night. The action starts at 8 p.m.
in the Pavilion.

Stanford swept four games
from Hawaii service teams on a
Christmas swing through our
newest state, and though tired,
they should be able to give Ore
gon all they can handle.
OREGON HAS won three of its
last four games and comes off a
second place in the Far West Clas
sic held in the Northwest during
Christmas vacation.
Oregon sports Charlie Warren,

a jump-shooting deacleye averag
ing over 20 points a game, and
driving Bill Simmons, as lino a
pair of forwards as there is on
the Pacific Coast.
After those two, the talent gets
thin.
CENTER WALLY KNECHT
has come along as a replacement
for the departed Glenn Moore, a

high-scorer lost due to scholastic
ineligibility, but is weak on de
fense and commits an excessive
number of fouls. Knecht is an of
fensive threat, as his 13-point av
erage indicates, but his rebound
ing leaves something to be de
sired. Even guard John Mack has
outrchounded him.

Guards Mack and Steve Jones
aren’t high scorers, but both are
dangerous defensively.
Reserves Jim Johnson and Verl
Pearce aren’t spectacular, but
they get the job done.
Stanford’s starting lineup
against Oregon will include
guards Don Clemetson and Dar
rell Sutherland, forwards John
Windsor and Hollis Moore, and
center Tom Dose.
DON CLEMETSON has been a

steady ten points per game scorer,
and his play making has been su
perb. His passes have been re
sponsible for a great deal of
Dose’s scoring total.

Sutherland has been Stanford’s
most spectacular scorer of late,
with an assortment of drives and
30-foot jump shots that has his
opponents talking to themselves.

Windsor was Stanford’s lead
ing scorer last year, and although
his point total has diminished, it
is because the scoring of the other
men has picked up, not due to a
lack of effectiveness on his part.
Windsor’s rebounding is per
haps the best on the team.

SOPHOMORE FORWARD Hol
lis Moore has replaced co-captain
Phil Kelly as a starting forward.
Moore has an excellent jump shot
and at 6-4 is an effective rebound
er.

You can’t say too much about
the work of center Tom Dose. He
has drawn raves as possibly the
best center Stanford has ever had.
He has been consistently in the
double scoring and rebounding
figures.
Stanford will bo favored, but
Oregon’s basketball resurgence
could carry them past the Indians.

Stanford radio station
K/SU, KBO on the dial, will
broadcast the freshman and
varsity basketball gain e s
against Oregon this weekend
on both Friday and Saturday.
Freshman game time is sched
uled fur (> p.m. both nights,
with the varsity slated to fol
low at K p.m.

The Daily received late
word that Wally Knecht,
starting center for the Ore
gon Webfoots, badly sprained
his ankle yesterday and is a
doubtful participant in to
night’s game between Stan
ford and Oregon.


THE STARTING FIVE for the Stanford basketball team tonight includes from left to right, center Tom
Dose, forward John Windsor, guard Don Clemetson, forward Hollis Moore, and guard Darrell Suther
land.
