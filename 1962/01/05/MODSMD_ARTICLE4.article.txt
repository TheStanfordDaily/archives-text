# Memorial Arch To be Rebuilt
## 
### 
Plans to "beef up” Memorial
Court arch and its adjacent ar
cades are under way in charge of
two Stanford professors of en
gineering.
James B. Wells, professor of
civil engineering emeritus, and
Jack Benjamin, professor of struc
tural engineering, are drawing up
plans and specifications for the
overhaul, scheduled to start this
summer.
Estimated cost of reconstruc
tion is $73,000.
Inspection has shown that the
arcade requires additional bracing
similar to that done to the east
and west arcades three years ago.
The free-standing structure con
nects the east and west portions
of Inner Quad, and gives access to
Memorial Church from the main
Memorial Court entrance.
During summer quarter, 1958.
the east and west arcades of Me
morial Court were rehabilitated.
A new tile roof was installed, and
wooden roof supports were re
placed with steel.
Key sandstone columns along
both arcades were ingeniously
“cored” and sectioned. A steel I
beam was inserted within the
core, and the sectioned columns
were re-mortared into place, hard
ly differing at first glance from
their original construction in 1891.
