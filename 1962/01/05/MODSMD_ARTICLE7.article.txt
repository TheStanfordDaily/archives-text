# $75,000 PLEDGED
## Esso Foundation Gift Boosts PACE Drive 
### 
A gift of $75,000 to Stanford
from the Esso Education Founda
tion was announced by the Uni
versity today. It came in response
to Stanford’s current PACE Pro
gram- a $lOO million fund-raising
effort.
The gift will be contributed in
five annual payments, marking
the first time the Foundation has
made a future commitment of
funds to Stanford. Esso is sup
ported by Standard Oil Company
of New Jersey and affiliates.
Over the past six years, Stan
ford has received $40,000 from the
Essa Foundation for continuing
support of undergraduate and sci

ence programs. In December, in
addition to its first payment on
the $75,000 pledge, the Foundation
sent $2,000 for use by Stanford’s
Department of Materials Science.
The Stanford PACE Program
was sparked partly by a 1960
five-year $25 million incentive
grant to Stanford from the Ford
Foundation, offering to provide
$1 in matching funds for every $3
raised from other private sources.
The Esso gift qualifies for match
ing Ford Foundation dollars.
The general objective of PACE
is to aid achievement of a new
“peak of excellence” in education
and research. Stanford so far has
received gifts and pledges total
ing more than $3O million toward
its goal. The initials PACE
stand for: Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era.
As the 1961 Esso awards were
announced, Chairman M. J. Rath
bone of the Foundation com
mented upon the “rapid evolu
tion of the very sizable develop
ment campaigns” at colleges and
universities to meet rising finan
cial needs.
He disclosed that the Founda
tion had increased its develop
ment and capital awards in 1961
by more than 50 per cent to $447,-
000 in the national program. He
said the campaigns are highly
significant “to all those having
an interest in the private support
of education.”

In accordance with fixed policy,
the Esso gift to the PACE Pro
gram is unrestricted as to use.
Rathbone said unrestricted grants
are viewed as “a highly desired
and effective form of assistance.”

raised from other private sources.
The Esso gift qualifies for match
ing Ford Foundation dollars.
The general objective of PACE
is to aid achievement of a new
“peak of excellence” in education
and research. Stanford so far has
received gifts and pledges total
ing more than $3O million toward
its goal. The initials PACE
stand for: Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era.
As the 1961 Esso awards were
announced, Chairman M. J. Rath
bone of the Foundation com
mented upon the “rapid evolu
tion of the very sizable develop
ment campaigns” at colleges and
universities to meet rising finan
cial needs.
He disclosed that the Founda
tion had increased its develop
ment and capital awards in 1961
by more than 50 per cent to $447,-
000 in the national program. He
said the campaigns are highly
significant “to all those having
an interest in the private support
of education.”

In accordance with fixed policy,
the Esso gift to the PACE Pro
gram is unrestricted as to use.
Rathbone said unrestricted grants
are viewed as “a highly desired
and effective form of assistance.”
A gift of $75,000 to Stanford
from the Esso Education Founda
tion was announced by the Uni
versity today. It came in response
to Stanford’s current PACE Pro
gram- a $lOO million fund-raising
effort.
The gift will be contributed in
five annual payments, marking
the first time the Foundation has
made a future commitment of
funds to Stanford. Esso is sup
ported by Standard Oil Company
of New Jersey and affiliates.
Over the past six years, Stan
ford has received $40,000 from the
Essa Foundation for continuing
support of undergraduate and sci

ence programs. In December, in
addition to its first payment on
the $75,000 pledge, the Foundation
sent $2,000 for use by Stanford’s
Department of Materials Science.
The Stanford PACE Program
was sparked partly by a 1960
five-year $25 million incentive
grant to Stanford from the Ford
Foundation, offering to provide
$1 in matching funds for every $3
raised from other private sources.
