# Senate Group To Investigate Army Censors
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UFO The
Senate inquiry into alleged muz
zling of military leaders will open
Jan. 23 with public testimony on
censoring of speeches in the De
fense and State departments,
chairman John C. Stennis an
nounced yesterday.
The Mississippi Democrat said
former Major Gen. Edwin A.
Walker has accepted an invitation
to testify during a later phase of
the study. Walker, relieved as an
Army division commander in Eu
rope in a controversy over his
troop indoctrination program, will
testify when the subcommittee
studies troop indoctrination and
training.

Stennis said his special eight
member subcommittee will meet
as soon as its members return to
Washington and approve subcom
mittee procedures and a witness
list. He said the subcommittee
also planned to look into partici
pation by military leader in anti
communist seminars and other
public information activities.

THE subcommittee study was
ordered last summer by the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee
after Sen. Strom Thurmond, D-
S.C., charged in a Senate speech
that such incidents as the blue
penciling of ant i-Communist
speeches by military leaders and
the Walker dismissal constituted
muzzling of the anti-Communist
views of military officers.
Expressing his personal views,
Stennis said he does not believe
there is a need for legislation in
the subcommittee’s area of inter
est. He said ho is sure that anti-
Communist views and speeches
have a place in the operations of
the military, especially in troop
indoctrination.

HOWEVER, he stressed that
military officers “just don’t have
a role” in partisan politics. A
problem sometimes arises, Sten
nis said, when military leaders
participate in seminars where
other speakers voice partisan po
litical views so that these views
and remarks of the military
speakers become linked in the
public mind.
Stennis said the hearings would
include a review of new and old
training films for the armed serv
ices. Controversy over the film
“Operation Abolition” prepared
under the auspices of the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities has been under study by
the Stennis subcommittee staff.
