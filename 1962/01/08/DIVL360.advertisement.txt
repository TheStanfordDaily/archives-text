when
Jimmy grows
as big as
his shadow
...the free world he lives in will he
using almost a million gallons of
petroleum every minute.
That’s about 60% more than it uses
today —by 1971.
Where will it all come from?
From hundreds of places on earth
you might never expect oil to exist.
Right now, for example, Standard’s
exploration teams are probing the
ocean floor many miles out to sea
... trekking across Arabian deserts,
marked “inaccessible” on maps.
Others are climbing over glaciers in
Alaska, pushing through the snow
into the frozen interior of Canada,
slogging through the jungles of Latin
America.
In the last ten years, geologists from
Standard and its affiliates explored
in 47 countries on six continents.
Is the search paying off?
Yes. In the United Slates alone, we
found two new barrels of oil for every
barrel we took out of the ground.
The search will continue to help
make certain that Jimmy and his
generation will have the oil they
need for an ever-expanding number
of homes, cars, mechanized farms and
industries ... and provide chemicals
from petroleum that will help make
possible more exciting new products.
