RING IN THE NEW
Arc you still writing “1961” on your papers and letters? I’ll
bet you are, you scamps! But I am not one to be harsh with
those who forget we are in a new year, for I myself have long
been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my senior year at
college, I wrote 1873 on my papers until nearly November of
1874! (It turned out, incidentally, not to be such a serious
error because, as we ail know, 1874 was later repealed by
President Chester A. Arthur in a fit of pique over the Black
Tom Explosion. And, as we all know, Mr. Arthur later came
to regret his hasty action. Who does not recall that famous
meeting between Mr. Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr.
Arthur said, “Lou, I wish I hadn’t of repealed 1874.” Where
upon the French cm))cror made his immortal rejoinder, “Tipi
que nous el tyler In.” Well sir, they had many a good laugh
about that, as you can imagine.)
But I digress. How can we remember to write 1962 on our
papers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find something
memorable about 1962, something unique to fix it firmly in
your mind. Happily, this is very simple because, as we all know,
1962 is the first year in history that is divisible by 2, by 4, and
by 7. Take a pencil and try it: 1962 divided by 2 is 981; 1962
divided by 4 is 490-1/2; 1962 divided by 7 is 280-2/7.This mathe
matical curiosity will not occur again until the year 2079, but
wc will all be so busy then celebrating the Chester A. Arthur

bi-centenary that we will scarcely have time to be writing
pa pers and letters and like that.
Another clever little trick to fix the year 1962 in your mind
is to remember that 1962 spelled backwards is 2691. “Year”
spelled backwards is “racy.” “Marlboro” spelled backwards is
“oroblram.” Marlboro smoked backwards is no fun at all.
Kindly do not light the filter. What you do is put the filter end
in your lips, then light the tobacco end, then draw, and then
find out what pleasure, what joy, what rapture serene it is to
smoke the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste. In 1962, as
in once and future years, you’ll get a lot to like in a Marlboro
available in soft pack and flip-top box in all 50 states and
Duluth.
But I digress. We were speaking of the memorable aspects
of 1962 and high among them, of course, is the fact that in
1962 the entire House of Representatives stands fur election.
There will, no doubt, be many lively and interesting contests,
but none, I’ll wager, quite so lively and interesting as the one
in my own district whore the leading candidate is none other
than Chester A. Arthur!
Mr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to come
out of retirement and run for the House of Representatives.
John Quincy Adams was the first. Mr. Adams also holds
another distinction: he was the first son of a president ever to
serve as president. It is true that Martin Van Buren’s son,
Walter “Blinky” Van Buren, was at one time offered the nomi
nation for the presidency, but he, alas, had already accepted
a bid to become Mad Ludwig of Bavaria. James K. Polk’s son,
on the other hand, became Salmon P. Chase. Millard Fill
more’s son went into air conditioning. This later was known as
the Missouri Compromise. (S* 1962 Max Shulmaa

In Missouri, or anywhere else, there is no compromise with
iliinlily in Marlboro or the new unaltered king-size Philip
Morris Commander. The Commander docs something new
in cigarette making—gently vacuum cleans the tobacco for
flavor and mildness. Oel aboard! You’ll be welcome.
