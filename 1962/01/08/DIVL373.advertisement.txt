Some say we go overboard, the lengths
we go to in testing Ford-built cars at
"Hurricane Road"—our wind-and
weather lab in Dearborn, Michigan.
And for practical purposes—we do.
You might call it "testing in depth. 1 ’
Ford scientists and engineers have
devised a gigantic test tunnel that
creates monsoon rains and tornadic
winds in a matter of minutes. Super
sun lamps boost temperatures from 20
below to 160 above zero. Fog and
drizzle, snow and sleet—all at the twist
of dials, Huge cylinders beneath test
car wheels imitate every kind of road:
from flat, smooth turnpike to rutted
mountain trail.
Out of it all comes knowledge of how to
build better cars—cars that are built to
last longer, require less care, and retain
their value better. This constant aiming
for perfection is just one more way in
which research and engineering are
earning for Ford Motor Company its
place of leadership.
