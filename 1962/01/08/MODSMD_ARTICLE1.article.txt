# MERIT SCHOLARS
## Stanford First Among Girls And Third Choice by Boys 
### 
Stanford is the most preferred college in the country among
high school girls scoring the highest in the National Merit Schol
arship examinations.
Among the boys who scored high in the exam, Stanford is
preferred to every college in the country except Harvard and MIT.

The National Merit Scholarship
Corporation made these findings
public Friday after asking its
highest scorers to name the col
leges and universities they would
prefer to attend.
ASSOCIATE Director of Admis
sions Nathaniel Allyn emphasized
how “gratifying this is to us, but
it is nothing dramatic, new, or re
markable; Stanford has for many
years been near the top in popu
larity among the girls honored in
the National Merit competition.’’
Of the more than 12,000 girls
replying to the poll, 448 preferred
Stanford, Following are Radcliffe
(403), Cornell (303), Wellesley
(274), Cal (231), University of
Michigan (230), Duke (218),
Smith (162), Barnard (156), and
Oberlin (151).
Of the more than 20,000 boys
replying 1476 chose Harvard. Fol
lowing are MIT (1400), Stanford
(713), CalTech (587), Yale (481),
Cal (428), Cornell (398), Prince
ton (397), Columbia (376) and
Rice (361).
“THESE figures,” Allyn said,
“do not mean that next year’s
entering class will be composed
of only those students honored by
the National Merit program. Per
sonal qualifications are still im
portant.”
Allyn added that the wiie serv
ices have already misinterpreted
the meaning of the figures. First,
Stanford’s being preferred to Rad
cliffe by 45 girls is less significant
when it is realized that the num
ber choosing Stanford is only 3
per cent of the total anyway.
To show the subtleties of the
figures’ meaning, Allyn cited the
situation at Cal Tech (4th ranked
among the boys) where the abso
lute number preferring to attend
may be five times the size of
their entering class.
