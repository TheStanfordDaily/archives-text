# WEST IRIAN
## Sukarno Threatens Invasion 
### 
BONTHAIN, Celebes, Indonesia
(UPl)—President Sukarno yes
terday said Indonesia wanted to
avoid bloodshed over West Irian
Dutch New Guinea but would
send “thousands and thousands”
of little boats to invade the terri
tory unless the Dutch gave it up
on his terms.

Sukarno told a wildly-cheering
crowd in this city in Southern
Celebes that he was not concern
ed about world reaction if Indo
nesia did go to war to wrest con
trol of the disputed territory from
the Dutch.
HE SAID his “liberation” cam
paign was supported by 2 million
people including Russia and the
Communist bloc countries and all
of the Afro-Asian nations.

The Indonesian president, rid
ing the crest of unprecedented
popularity on a tour of the fabled
“Spice Islands.” said Indonesia
would ignore any criticisms of an
attack on the Dutch-controlled
territory.
“Will it startle the world?” Su
karno asked. “We don’t mind. We
don’t care.”
SUKAKNO said that the de
cision of war or peace depended
on the Netherlands and its will
ingness to negotiate on the basis
of transferring authority of West
Guinea to Indonesia.

“We want talks but unless they
are based on a transfer of admin
istration ... we don’t want any
talks,” he said.
He said if the Dutch wore will
ing to negotiate on his terms,
“there will be no bloodshed—l
will shake hands with the Dutch.”
SUKARNO said that the dis
patch of the Dutch aircraft car
rier Karel Doorman to West
Guinea waters would have little
effect in forestalling any possible
invasion.

“What will the Karel Doorman
do if, one dark night, thousands
and thousands of little sampans,
small boats with people inside,
enter and invade West Irian?” he
asked. “Can it shoot them all? We
are not afraid.”
Sukarno said the Indonesian
people “had nothing hut bamboo
spears” in the struggle for liber
ation from the Netherlands in
1915. But, he added, “wo had
something you can touch, see and
feel—we had spirit aflame.”
