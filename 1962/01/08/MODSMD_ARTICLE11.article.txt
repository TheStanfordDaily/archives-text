# FARM PROF SUGGESTS:
## Market Excess Grain Supply As War Surplus Commodity 
### 
The United States’ swollen g
tents—should be written off as wa
economist contends, Karl Brandi
Food Research Institute and fori
bower’s Council of Economic Ad\
by a Grain Conversion Board at-i
no cost to taxpayers.
The government would give the
Board title to all its excess grain
now carried on the books at $3.5
billion. To avoid upsetting world
grain markets, the Board would
be required to convert the grain
to staple livestock products over
a period of six to eight years.
THESE products would then be
marketed abroad through private
firms, in much the same way that
obsolete armed service material
was distributed through war sur
plus stores. The Board would also
be entitled to donate certain quan
tities to foreign charity.
When these transactions were
finished, Brandt estimates, the
Board would return $1 billion or
more to the Treasury. In effect,
the book value of the U.S.'s mas
sive food surplus inventory would
have been written down by $2.5
billion. Offsetting this paper loss
would be annual savings of $7OO
million in storage, spoilage and
interest costs now required for
food surplus management.
Simultaneously, Brandt sug

associate director of Stanford’s

gests, the government should pro
gressively disengage itself from
U.S. commodity markets. During
this transaction period, perhaps
four years long, the United States
would help producers of chronic
surplus commodities by buying
their allotments and marketing
quotas. This financial aid, in ef
fect amount to government in
demnities for abolishing an “un
workable” farm policy, he ex
plains.
STEPPED-UP state and federal
aid for farmers seeking non-farm
employment, diplomatic efforts to
lower trade barriers against
United States farm exports, and
continuation of the “Food-for-
Freedom” program also arc ad
vocated by Brandt.
“Legislation along these lines,”
he concludes, “would use free
market mechanisms to adjust
farm output, protect the economy
against further inflation caused
by agricultural price supports,
and would shield farmers from
declines in their income and
equity.
