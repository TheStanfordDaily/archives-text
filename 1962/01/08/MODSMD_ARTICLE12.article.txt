# Cardinal Debaters Second at Golden West Championships
## 
### 
Stanfordâ€™s debate team carried
off the second place trophy in
competition with 25 schools at the
Golden West Invitational Cham
pionships over the weekend at the
University of Redlands.

The Farm duo of Mike Hall and
Chuck Bischoff out-debated pairs
from Georgetown, Pennsylvania,
Brigham Young, Arizona, Fresno
and Whittier in the preliminary
rounds, disputing the topic: Re
solved, that labor organizations
should be under the jurisdiction
of antitrust legislation.
IN THE quarterfinals, Stanford
uphold the negative on the propo
sition, and won the decision over
Pepperdine. Moving to the semi
finals, Hall and Bischoff support
ed the affirmative and defeated
Georgetown University a second
time. But the Stanfordites falter
ed in the finals, losing the decision
to the host school, Redlands.

Arguments under the general
topic ranged over a wide variety
of economic and political matter.
Labor unions activities including
price-fixing, putting firms out of
business, featherbedding and re
striction of technological ad
vancement were condemned by
affirmative debaters. Another ma
jor question disputed was the pos
sibility of strikes which cause na
tional emergencies.
EACH university was allowed
to enter only one team, to insure a
high level of competition. The na
tional field of teams included
speakers from as far away as
Dartmouth.

Six rounds of debate were con
tested on Saturday, lasting eleven
hours. Thus, the tournament was
as much a test of endurance as
anything.
The Stanford speakers were ac
companied by the Farm director
of forensics, Dr. Jon Ericson.
