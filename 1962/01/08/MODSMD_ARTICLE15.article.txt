# Shell for Governor An Unwise Choice
## 
### 
The man who might upset Richard Nixon and Goodwin Knight
for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in June’s primary
balloting presented his platform here Thursday, but the man him
self turned out to be far more impressive than the platform.
Assemblyman Joe Shell is obviously an honest, straightforward
and courageous man, and to our mind a better person than either
of his competitors. His courage can be gathered from his deter
mination to wield a blue pencil on the state’s budget if elected.
Since this would mean crossing powerful state agencies, politicians
and special interest groups, one can only admire such fortitude.
His statement, in rejecting such lunatic groups as the John Birch
Society, that citizens should work through one of the two political
parties to bring about changes in our society also makes sense,
particularly because he probably could get endorsement from some
of the wealthy far-right groups because of his conservative views.
While his chances of upsetting Nixon or Knight appear slim
now, he bears watching because of his cultivation of the grass
roots Republican clubs and precinct workers in the state.
Mr. Shell’s platform, however, should discourage most of tire
general electorate from choosing him. Even Nixon would be a
better governor, and that’s going pretty far.
Shell believes that California’s taxation rate is within one per
centage point of dooming the state, and the representative system
of government. He calls the Brown programs (and Earl Warren’s,
too) “basic socialism.”

He declares he would have no qualms about cutting the state
budget if elected—apparently feeling that much of the social wel
fare legislation passed under the Democratic administration is un
necessary.

As is too often the case with those who would use the blue
pencil, however, the assemblyman would penalize citizens who
need state aid in order to help the small businessman. We could
expect to see necessary welfare programs hit hard in a Shell ad
ministration, such as unemployment compensation, schools, old
age benefits and other similar aid programs which conservatives
seem to feel are unnecessary.

Since Shell said “I have seen us going progressively deeper into
basic socialism during my five legislative terms,” one can only
assume that he would drastically cut taxes and the budget—a
procedure that would be fine for some businessmen but perhaps
not so good for the migrant farm worker, the teacher, unemployed
and aged person.

One can also be pardoned for questioning Shell’s statement
that one cannot have representative government without free enter
prise. Life and politics just aren t that black and white. Free enter
prise has its good points, but so does socialism. To say that either
is necessary for representative government is unwise at a univer
sity where one discovers that things aren’t quite that simple.

that one cannot have representative government without free enter
prise. Life and politics just aren t that black and white. Free enter
prise has its good points, but so does socialism. To say that either
is necessary for representative government is unwise at a univer
sity where one discovers that things aren’t quite that simple.
The man who might upset Richard Nixon and Goodwin Knight
for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in June’s primary
balloting presented his platform here Thursday, but the man him
self turned out to be far more impressive than the platform.
Assemblyman Joe Shell is obviously an honest, straightforward
and courageous man, and to our mind a better person than either
of his competitors. His courage can be gathered from his deter
mination to wield a blue pencil on the state’s budget if elected.
Since this would mean crossing powerful state agencies, politicians
and special interest groups, one can only admire such fortitude.
His statement, in rejecting such lunatic groups as the John Birch
Society, that citizens should work through one of the two political
parties to bring about changes in our society also makes sense,
particularly because he probably could get endorsement from some
of the wealthy far-right groups because of his conservative views.
While his chances of upsetting Nixon or Knight appear slim
now, he bears watching because of his cultivation of the grass
roots Republican clubs and precinct workers in the state.
Mr. Shell’s platform, however, should discourage most of tire
general electorate from choosing him. Even Nixon would be a
better governor, and that’s going pretty far.
Shell believes that California’s taxation rate is within one per
centage point of dooming the state, and the representative system
of government. He calls the Brown programs (and Earl Warren’s,
too) “basic socialism.”

He declares he would have no qualms about cutting the state
budget if elected—apparently feeling that much of the social wel
fare legislation passed under the Democratic administration is un
necessary.

As is too often the case with those who would use the blue
pencil, however, the assemblyman would penalize citizens who
need state aid in order to help the small businessman. We could
expect to see necessary welfare programs hit hard in a Shell ad
ministration, such as unemployment compensation, schools, old
age benefits and other similar aid programs which conservatives
seem to feel are unnecessary.

Since Shell said “I have seen us going progressively deeper into
basic socialism during my five legislative terms,” one can only
assume that he would drastically cut taxes and the budget—a
procedure that would be fine for some businessmen but perhaps
not so good for the migrant farm worker, the teacher, unemployed
and aged person.

One can also be pardoned for questioning Shell’s statement
that one cannot have representative government without free enter
prise. Life and politics just aren t that black and white. Free enter
prise has its good points, but so does socialism. To say that either
