TOUCHE
Editor, The Daily;
The financially desperate po
sition of America’s flagpole sit
ters, etc., was recently outlined to
a student subcommittee at Stan
ford. The picture painted was not
an encouraging one.
Even at Stanford, where once
thousands stood in awe at the
Post Office flagpole upon which
rugged individualists demonstrat
ed their art for days, the only art
of flagpoles viewed today is an oc
casional new coat of paint applied
by daring firemen on extension
ladders. No campus financial sup
port for this and other such arts
is forthcoming.
This is only one example of the
plight of flagpole sitters, goldfish
swallowers, and other individual
ists of that ilk. Testimony reveal
ed the majority of such Ameri
cans are abysmally paid, and often
cannot devote full time to their
art because they hold down an
other job for bread. Some quit en
tirely. All of this in the world’s
most affluent society!
It is rumored that some U.S.
Congressmen take the view:
“There’s no hope for Congres
sional action. If communities want
such arts, they should pay for it
themselves.’’ Oh, fie on such an
attitude! If this view holds sway
much longer, there will be very
little left of such arts to worry
about!
There is more to life than bub
blegum, Sunday flicks, the Twist,
etc., which are worshipped in our
society. American individualists
have much to offer the world in
these arts, but they need money!
Obviously, no one has money any
more except Fed. Gov., so here is

an obvious situation in which a
little Fed. Money could have tre
mendous effects. There is no rea
son, e.g., why JFK couldn’t an
nounce that the U.S. was diverting
$lO billion one Nova rocket costs
to establish a National Commis
sion on the Arts. This commission
could launch a program aiding
tax-poor communities to afford
the spectacle of the artists.

Lewis related how the “give
and take” worked out during the
two months that six U.S. univer
sity students lived in the hut
dwellings of San Andres de la
Cal, an ancient Nahautel village
of about 500 persons in 90 fami
lies.

“The villagers wept when our
students left,” he said.
He identified the students as
three anthropology majors, Mrs.
Janet Kitchen, Philip Young and
Muriel Kaminsky; a Latin Ameri
can literature student, Judith Za
lenka; a political science student,
Thomas Tirado, all of the Uni
versity of Illinois Graduate
School, and Ofelia Vargas, of Wel
lesley College.

to do something for the people

The financially desperate po
sition of America’s flagpole sit
ters, etc., was recently outlined to
a student subcommittee at Stan
ford. The picture painted was not
an encouraging one.
Even at Stanford, where once
thousands stood in awe at the
Post Office flagpole upon which
rugged individualists demonstrat
ed their art for days, the only art
of flagpoles viewed today is an oc
casional new coat of paint applied
by daring firemen on extension
ladders. No campus financial sup
port for this and other such arts
is forthcoming.
This is only one example of the
plight of flagpole sitters, goldfish
swallowers, and other individual
ists of that ilk. Testimony reveal
ed the majority of such Ameri
cans are abysmally paid, and often
cannot devote full time to their
art because they hold down an
other job for bread. Some quit en
tirely. All of this in the world’s
most affluent society!
It is rumored that some U.S.
Congressmen take the view:
“There’s no hope for Congres
sional action. If communities want
such arts, they should pay for it
themselves.’’ Oh, fie on such an
attitude! If this view holds sway
much longer, there will be very
little left of such arts to worry
about!
There is more to life than bub
blegum, Sunday flicks, the Twist,
etc., which are worshipped in our
society. American individualists
have much to offer the world in
these arts, but they need money!
Obviously, no one has money any
more except Fed. Gov., so here is

an obvious situation in which a
little Fed. Money could have tre
mendous effects. There is no rea
son, e.g., why JFK couldn’t an
nounce that the U.S. was diverting
$lO billion one Nova rocket costs
to establish a National Commis
sion on the Arts. This commission
could launch a program aiding
tax-poor communities to afford
the spectacle of the artists.
