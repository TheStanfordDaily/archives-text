## Goa and New Guinea 
### 
Two current happenings are
worth examining together: In
dia’s conflict with Portugal over
Goa and Indonesia’s controversy
with the Netherlands over West
New Guinea. The more closely we
study them, the clearer it is that
although superficially they look
somewhat alike, fundamentally
they are quite different.

The essential difference is that
in the case of Goa the government
of Portugal took an absolute po
sition that the status of Goa was
not negotiable. Goa is a small en
clave on the mainland of India
and Dr. Salazar insisted on having
it treated as a part of Portugal
with its capital in Lisbon. He in
sisted that Goa must remain an
integral part of Portugal and he
bolted the doors firmly against
any negotiation about it.
Though Britain and France left
the Indian continent peaceably,
for 15 years Portugal has refused
to leave it peaceably or even to
talk about leaving it ever. The de
termining fact about the Goa
question is that though it was in
fact a Portugese colony in India,
Portugal denied that there was
any peaceable method of doing
what Britain and France had
done about the rest of the Indian
continent.

GOA POINTS UP sharply, as I
remember from many talks with
him, John Foster Dulles’s worries
about what he regarded as one of
the great defects of the United
Nations charter. In his book,
“War or Peace,” which was pub
lished in 1950 before he was Sec
retary of State and was still an
adviser to the Truman adminis
tration, he wrote that “the possi
bility of peaceful change Is a fun
damental prerequisite to peace”
for “if we set up barriers to all
change, we make it certain that
there will be a violent and explo
sive change.” That is what hap
pened in Goa. Dr. Salazar set up
barriers to all change, and after 15
years there was a violent and ex
plosive change.
It has been said recently that
Nehru’s action in Goa is a prece
dent and an incitement to Sukar
no to seize West New' Guinea.
The two cases are quite different.
The Netherlands, unlike Portu
gal, has set up no barrier to
change. On the contrary, it has in
vited peaceful change by the con
ciliatory procedures of the United
Nations and of the world com
munity.
The Netherlands, therefore, has
come into court with clean hands
and it is entitled to the full sup
port of the world community in
guaranteeing that the change,
which is to come in West New
Guinea, will be a peaceful change.
THE USE OF military force by
Indonesia when the Netherlands
is inviting peaceful change would
be wanton aggression against the
charter of the U.N.
The island of New Guinea lies
to the east of Indonesia and north
of Australia. The western part is

governed by the Netherlands, the
eastern by Australia. The people
are the Papuans. They are so
primitive that by comparison the
Congolese are highly advanced.
There can be no question in the
foreseeable future of their being
able to govern themselves as a
nation-state in the kind of world
we live in. In their foreign rela
tions, in the maintenance of pub
lic order, and for their develop
ment as a people, they must have
tutelage from more advanced peo
ple. If the Dutch must go, and
after them the Australians, some
one else—who is no more Papuan
than the Dutch or the Australians
—-would have to take over. For
this role the Indonesians have
nominated themselves.
Their claim to West New Gui
nea is not that it is inhabited by
Indonesians, as is Goa by Indians,
but that West New Guinea was
part of the colonial empire of the
Netherlands and that they are the
heirs of that empire. They are not
pleading merely for the end of
colonialism. They are asking for
the transfer to themselves of a
Netherlands colony. Their legal
and moral position is no different
than that which prevailed in the
nineteenth century when the
great colonial powers in Africa
used to transfer bits of territory
from one to the other.
THE MEMBERS OF the UN.
will have to ask themselves why
they should support the estab
lishment of a new empire in the
Pacific.

The reality and the morality of
the affair seems to me to call for
a new status in which no nation,
not the Netherlands and not In
donesia, becomes the colonial
overlord. That would mean setting
up West New Guinea as a trust
territory, administered under
some form of mandate from the
United Nations to protect, educate
and help the Papuan people.
If this can be done, the United
Nations will regain much of its
weakened prestige.

Two current happenings are
worth examining together: In
dia’s conflict with Portugal over
Goa and Indonesia’s controversy
with the Netherlands over West
New Guinea. The more closely we
study them, the clearer it is that
although superficially they look
somewhat alike, fundamentally
they are quite different.

The essential difference is that
in the case of Goa the government
of Portugal took an absolute po
sition that the status of Goa was
not negotiable. Goa is a small en
clave on the mainland of India
and Dr. Salazar insisted on having
it treated as a part of Portugal
with its capital in Lisbon. He in
sisted that Goa must remain an
integral part of Portugal and he
bolted the doors firmly against
any negotiation about it.
Though Britain and France left
the Indian continent peaceably,
for 15 years Portugal has refused
to leave it peaceably or even to
talk about leaving it ever. The de
termining fact about the Goa
question is that though it was in
fact a Portugese colony in India,
Portugal denied that there was
any peaceable method of doing
what Britain and France had
done about the rest of the Indian
continent.

GOA POINTS UP sharply, as I
remember from many talks with
him, John Foster Dulles’s worries
about what he regarded as one of
the great defects of the United
Nations charter. In his book,
“War or Peace,” which was pub
lished in 1950 before he was Sec
retary of State and was still an
adviser to the Truman adminis
tration, he wrote that “the possi
bility of peaceful change Is a fun
damental prerequisite to peace”
for “if we set up barriers to all
change, we make it certain that
there will be a violent and explo
sive change.” That is what hap
pened in Goa. Dr. Salazar set up
barriers to all change, and after 15
years there was a violent and ex
plosive change.
It has been said recently that
Nehru’s action in Goa is a prece
dent and an incitement to Sukar
no to seize West New' Guinea.
The two cases are quite different.
The Netherlands, unlike Portu
gal, has set up no barrier to
change. On the contrary, it has in
vited peaceful change by the con
ciliatory procedures of the United
Nations and of the world com
munity.
The Netherlands, therefore, has
come into court with clean hands
and it is entitled to the full sup
port of the world community in
guaranteeing that the change,
which is to come in West New
Guinea, will be a peaceful change.
THE USE OF military force by
Indonesia when the Netherlands
is inviting peaceful change would
be wanton aggression against the
charter of the U.N.
The island of New Guinea lies
to the east of Indonesia and north
of Australia. The western part is

governed by the Netherlands, the
eastern by Australia. The people
are the Papuans. They are so
primitive that by comparison the
Congolese are highly advanced.
There can be no question in the
foreseeable future of their being
able to govern themselves as a
nation-state in the kind of world
we live in. In their foreign rela
tions, in the maintenance of pub
lic order, and for their develop
ment as a people, they must have

It has been said recently that
Nehru’s action in Goa is a prece
dent and an incitement to Sukar
no to seize West New' Guinea.
The two cases are quite different.
The Netherlands, unlike Portu
gal, has set up no barrier to
change. On the contrary, it has in
vited peaceful change by the con
ciliatory procedures of the United
Nations and of the world com
munity.
The Netherlands, therefore, has
come into court with clean hands
and it is entitled to the full sup
port of the world community in
guaranteeing that the change,
which is to come in West New
Guinea, will be a peaceful change.
THE USE OF military force by
Indonesia when the Netherlands
is inviting peaceful change would
be wanton aggression against the
charter of the U.N.
The island of New Guinea lies
to the east of Indonesia and north
of Australia. The western part is

governed by the Netherlands, the
eastern by Australia. The people
are the Papuans. They are so
primitive that by comparison the
Congolese are highly advanced.
There can be no question in the
foreseeable future of their being
able to govern themselves as a
nation-state in the kind of world
we live in. In their foreign rela
tions, in the maintenance of pub
lic order, and for their develop
ment as a people, they must have
tutelage from more advanced peo
ple. If the Dutch must go, and
after them the Australians, some
one else—who is no more Papuan
than the Dutch or the Australians
—-would have to take over. For
this role the Indonesians have
nominated themselves.
Their claim to West New Gui
nea is not that it is inhabited by
Indonesians, as is Goa by Indians,
but that West New Guinea was
part of the colonial empire of the
Netherlands and that they are the
heirs of that empire. They are not
pleading merely for the end of
colonialism. They are asking for
the transfer to themselves of a
Netherlands colony. Their legal
and moral position is no different
than that which prevailed in the
nineteenth century when the
great colonial powers in Africa
used to transfer bits of territory
from one to the other.
THE MEMBERS OF the UN.
will have to ask themselves why
they should support the estab
lishment of a new empire in the
Pacific.

The reality and the morality of
the affair seems to me to call for
a new status in which no nation,
not the Netherlands and not In
donesia, becomes the colonial
overlord. That would mean setting
up West New Guinea as a trust
territory, administered under
some form of mandate from the
United Nations to protect, educate
and help the Papuan people.
If this can be done, the United
Nations will regain much of its
weakened prestige.

Two current happenings are
worth examining together: In
dia’s conflict with Portugal over
Goa and Indonesia’s controversy
with the Netherlands over West
New Guinea. The more closely we
study them, the clearer it is that
although superficially they look
somewhat alike, fundamentally
they are quite different.

The essential difference is that
in the case of Goa the government
of Portugal took an absolute po
sition that the status of Goa was
not negotiable. Goa is a small en
clave on the mainland of India
and Dr. Salazar insisted on having
it treated as a part of Portugal
with its capital in Lisbon. He in
sisted that Goa must remain an
integral part of Portugal and he
bolted the doors firmly against
any negotiation about it.
Though Britain and France left
the Indian continent peaceably,
for 15 years Portugal has refused
to leave it peaceably or even to
talk about leaving it ever. The de
termining fact about the Goa
question is that though it was in
fact a Portugese colony in India,
Portugal denied that there was
any peaceable method of doing
what Britain and France had
done about the rest of the Indian
continent.

GOA POINTS UP sharply, as I
remember from many talks with
him, John Foster Dulles’s worries
about what he regarded as one of
the great defects of the United
Nations charter. In his book,
“War or Peace,” which was pub
lished in 1950 before he was Sec
retary of State and was still an
adviser to the Truman adminis
tration, he wrote that “the possi
bility of peaceful change Is a fun
damental prerequisite to peace”
for “if we set up barriers to all
change, we make it certain that
there will be a violent and explo
sive change.” That is what hap
pened in Goa. Dr. Salazar set up
barriers to all change, and after 15
years there was a violent and ex
plosive change.
