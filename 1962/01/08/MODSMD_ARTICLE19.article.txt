# Anthropologist's Model for Peace

### JAIME PLENN 
MEXICO CITY (UPI) An
American anthropologist and
author has come up with a plan
which he says could be used as a
guide for the U.S. Government’s
Peace Corps program in Latin
America.

Oscar Lewis, a University of
Illinois professor who has made
a 20-year study of Mexican rural
life, said the plan is based on the
experience of a group of U.S. stu
dents in a small Mexican village
during the past summer. Lewis
directed the students in a two
month pioneering stay at the “off
the-beaten-path” village of San
Andres de la Cal.
“The combination of an anthro
pology field team tasks with
those of the ‘Peace Corps’ offers
opportunity for an excellent; give
and-take relationship with Latin
American rural residents,” he
said.

“INSTEAD OF swamping them
with gadgets that Americans
think the people should have, the
team tries to fill the needs ex
pressed by villagers and actively
helps them while at the same time
gathering research material about
their culture.”

of my 20-year study can be ap
plied in our Latin American pro
grams for people-to-people rela
tionships.”

He said the students had an
opportunity to do their field work
while living in the village devoid
of the usual middle class com
forts—no running water, no elec
tricity, no gas.

Some of the group knew Span
ish, but others learned it in their
two-month slay, he said. The vil
lagers are “bilingual,” speaking
both Spanish and Nahautel.
Willingness of “people of cul
ture” to live the simple life of
the peasants and share their daily
chores impressed the villagers
greatly, Lewis said, and each stu
dent became a “Padrino” or “Ma
drina” (godfather or godmother)
of several village children.
ONE STUDENT, Mrs. Fitchen,
took her year-old baby with her
during their stay.
The villagers were greatly in

forested in learning English.
Some had been to the United
States as “braceros” (farm field
hands) but had not learned much
English there because of their
isolated work-camp residence, he
said.

Lewis said lie selected the vil
lage for the pioneer “humanized
anthropology” project because of
earlier studies of documents hun
dreds of years old pertaining to
the area and personal recommen
dations of friends in Tepoztlan.
AT TEPOZTLAN, Lewis did
much of his Mexican research
work, continuing the work of an
other U.S. scholar, Robert Red
field, and his studies have been
the basis for several books prior
to “The Children of Sanchez,” his
latest work.
Lewis has done field research
work in Canada, Cuba, India,
Spain, and Texas in addition to
Mexico which has been his major
focus of interest.
