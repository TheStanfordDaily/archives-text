# Card Ruggers Please Coach
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity ruggers won
two games in weekend rugby ac
tion. The games were played in
an informal rugby carnival held
on the Stanford rugby field Sat
urday.
The Stanford jv’s also won two
games while a second junior var
sity team was defeated twice.
Tribe Coach Pete Kmotovic was
pleased with the scrimmage and
termed his 1962 team “promis
ing.” He liked the work of new
men Dick Leeuwenberg and
Frank Patitucci.
