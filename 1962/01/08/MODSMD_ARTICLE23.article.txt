# Friday... Stanford 79 Oregon 54
## 
### GLENN ALFORD Daily Sports Editor 
Stanford systematically picked
Oregon apart to demolish the
Webfoots 79-54 in a basketball
game played Friday night in the
Pavilion.
Center Tom Dose had his big
gest night as a Stanford basket
ball player, scoring 27 points and
pulling down 20 rebounds.
HIGHLY TOUTED Oregon for
ward Charlie Warren led the
Northerners with 18 points. How
ever all he showed Bay Area hoop
fans was that he is a dead-eye
from the free throw line, making
10 of 11. From (he floor he was
less than sensational. Warren hit
four of 15 shots and displayed a
big mouth.
In fact, when he fouled out with
six minutes left, it may have been
because the referees were tired
ot listening to his constant com
plaining.
When Dose broke a 2-2 tie with 1
a short jumper, Stanford was!
ahead to stay. Four points by)
John Windsor brought the In- j
dians to a six-point lead at 15-9, |
and a three-point play by Dose j
made it 18-9.
OREGON CAME close again at I
25-18, but Phil Kelly got hot and j
scored six points in the last four
minutes of the first half and Stan-1
ford led 38-24 at the intermission, i
Dose led the first half scoring j
with 10 points. Warren had eight j
for Oregon.
Dose ended all speculation
about the outcome of the game
with nine points in the first three
and a half minutes of the second
half. When the 6-8 center went
out of the game midway through
the second halt the score was 63-
46, but Stanford wasn’t finished
yet.
RESERVE FORWARD Bill El
ving and Kelly led a Stanford j
spree that included holding Ore- j
gon scoreless for one seven-min- j
ute period. In fact, reserve Tom I
Tuttle got the only Oregon field
goal in the last ten minutes of the j
game.
Kelly’s floor play was outstand- j
ing, and guards Darrell Slither-1
land and Don and Doug Clemet- !
son forced the Ducks into 30 ball
control errors. The Oregon play
was exceedingly sloppy, and War
ren was the chief slob.
Time after time he would pass
up a chance to set up a teammate
for a good shot to take a bad one
himself. The harassing defense of
Kelly and Hollis Moore kept him
off-balance from the start and he
never recovered.

four of 15 shots and displayed a
big mouth.
In fact, when he fouled out with
six minutes left, it may have been
because the referees were tired
ot listening to his constant com
plaining.
When Dose broke a 2-2 tie with 1
a short jumper, Stanford was!
ahead to stay. Four points by)
John Windsor brought the In- j
dians to a six-point lead at 15-9, |
and a three-point play by Dose j
made it 18-9.
OREGON CAME close again at I
25-18, but Phil Kelly got hot and j
scored six points in the last four
minutes of the first half and Stan-1
ford led 38-24 at the intermission, i
Dose led the first half scoring j
with 10 points. Warren had eight j
for Oregon.
Dose ended all speculation
about the outcome of the game
with nine points in the first three
and a half minutes of the second
half. When the 6-8 center went
out of the game midway through
the second halt the score was 63-
46, but Stanford wasn’t finished
yet.
RESERVE FORWARD Bill El
ving and Kelly led a Stanford j
spree that included holding Ore- j
gon scoreless for one seven-min- j
ute period. In fact, reserve Tom I
Tuttle got the only Oregon field
goal in the last ten minutes of the j
game.
Kelly’s floor play was outstand- j
ing, and guards Darrell Slither-1
land and Don and Doug Clemet- !
son forced the Ducks into 30 ball
control errors. The Oregon play
was exceedingly sloppy, and War
ren was the chief slob.
Time after time he would pass
up a chance to set up a teammate
for a good shot to take a bad one
himself. The harassing defense of
Kelly and Hollis Moore kept him
off-balance from the start and he
never recovered.
