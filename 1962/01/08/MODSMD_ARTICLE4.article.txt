State Dean Rusk said after a Sat

disagreement between them on
basic Berlin policy.
In what could have been a re

and Clay “reviewed the general
problem of the effective handling
of possible crisis situations and
we have reached full agreements
on the policy to be followed dur
ing these months.”
THE President said the meet

Mr. Rusk, Gen. Clay and I can
keep in closest touch.” He added
that the country was fortunate to
have Clay "as the senior Ameri
can in Berlin.”

Clay, who arrived in Washing

ed that now instructions were be
ing sent to Llwellyn E. Thompson,
U.S. ambassador to Moscow, for
his next “exploratory” Berlin
talk with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko.
Like the Thompson-Gromyko
talks, the Kennedy-Clay White
House conference was part of a
renewed U.S. effort to push for
some kind of agreement with the
Soviets on Berlin.

In advance of his meetings here,
Clay was reported to have felt
that the U.S. military commander
in Berlin. Maj. Gen. Albert Wat
son, should be given greater on
the-spot authority to deal with
provocations along the Berlin
wall.

BOTH Clay and Secretary of
State Dean Rusk said after a Sat
urday meeting that there was no
disagreement between them on
basic Berlin policy.
In what could have been a re
ference to this point, the Presi
dent said in his statement that he
and Clay “reviewed the general
problem of the effective handling
of possible crisis situations and
we have reached full agreements
on the policy to be followed dur
ing these months.”
THE President said the meet
ing was “one more way in which
Mr. Rusk, Gen. Clay and I can
keep in closest touch.” He added
that the country was fortunate to
have Clay "as the senior Ameri
can in Berlin.”

Clay, who arrived in Washing
ton Friday, is scheduled to return
to Berlin today.
