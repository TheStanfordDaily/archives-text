# STUDENTS AID DEPT.
## Stanford Fire Department Is Major Factor in Area Safety 
### 
Stanford University’s unusual
fire department, which dates back
to a hand-drawn pumper and
hose reel in Senator Stanford’s
day, has come of age.

A first-rate fire defense unit,
it compares well with those in
many Peninsula cities of less area
and larger population.
Last July 1 the department offi
cially became a major part of the
Bay Area communications net
work when it opened a 24-hour
control center which talk with
both Stanford fire and police
units and eight other neighboring
jurisdictions, if necessary.
Its mutual aid agreements
among Palo Alto and neighboring
communities make it always
available to lend strong support
to any beleaguered neighbor.
And strong support means Just
that—the department boasts five
engines, including an 85-foot
aerial ladder, and a combination
station wagon-first aid vehicle.
It has 22 paid firemen and 10
student firefighters under Chief
John Marston, a veteran of 35
years in public safety. Students
earn their way through school
while on duty.

If an alarm is sounded, eight
professional firemen respond im
mediately. If more help is needed,
four blasts are sounded on the
fire station’s air horn, and the
student firemen literally drop
whatever they’re doing and re
port to the station.

The student firemen sleep in

the dormitory above the fire
house with the regular shift. In
addition, almost all “hash”—wait
on tables for their meals.

At the fire house, they have two
study rooms with six desks each.
They serve on a one-day-on, one
day-off schedule that doesn’t
hamper their participation in
sports or any other aspect of un
dergraduate life.
The students do their part in
protecting a university communi
ty of 8800 acres and 15,000 per
sons from fires, as well as helping
with fire prevention, rescues, first
aid, investigation, and salvage
work. They also help repair and
maintain their equipment and
quarters.
Drills are held daily for both
professional and student firemen
under Capt. Harry Lund, training
officer. All University buildings
arc inspected monthly, including
dormitories. Special details mount
guard at heavily-attend student
activities.

Efficiency pays off. During the
1960-61 academic year, according
to Chief John Marston’s annual
report, the department responded
to a record high of 311 alarms.
But the actual cash fire loss of
$25,642 was low- $1.70 per capita,
compared to the national norm of
$4.13.

All University buildings are con
nected to headquarters with a fire
alarm system. Some, such as Hoo
ver Institution and the Hansen
Laboratories of Physics, are
equipped with automatic alarms.
