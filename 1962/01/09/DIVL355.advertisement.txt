Almost every scientifically trained man can find stimulating and rewarding career
opportunities within the broad spectrum of Pratt & Whitney Aircraft activities.
From the solid foundation of 36 years as a world leader in Right propulsion systems,
P&WA development activities and research investigations today arc far ranging. In
addition to continuing and concentrated development effort on air breathing and rocket
engines, new and exciting avenues arc being explored in every field of advanced aero
space, marine, and industrial power applications.
The reach of the future ahead is indicated by current programs. Presently, Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft is exploring the fringe areas of technical knowledge in magnetohydro
dynamics . . . thcrmionics and thermo-electric conversions . . . hypersonic propulsion . - .
fuel cells and nuclear power.
To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ,->.mbitious young engineers
and scientists. Your degree? It can be in: MECHANICAL ■ AERONAUTICAL
■ ELECTRICAL ■ CHEMICAL and NUCLLAR ENGINEERING ■ PHYSICS
■ CHEMISTRY ■ METALLURGY ■ CERAMICS ■ MATHEMATICS ■ ENGI
NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS.
Tire field still broadens. The challenge grows greater. And a future of recognition
and advancement may be here for you.

From the solid foundation of 36 years as a world leader in Right propulsion systems,
P&WA development activities and research investigations today arc far ranging. In
addition to continuing and concentrated development effort on air breathing and rocket
engines, new and exciting avenues arc being explored in every field of advanced aero
space, marine, and industrial power applications.
The reach of the future ahead is indicated by current programs. Presently, Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft is exploring the fringe areas of technical knowledge in magnetohydro
dynamics . . . thcrmionics and thermo-electric conversions . . . hypersonic propulsion . - .
fuel cells and nuclear power.
To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ,->.mbitious young engineers
and scientists. Your degree? It can be in: MECHANICAL ■ AERONAUTICAL
■ ELECTRICAL ■ CHEMICAL and NUCLLAR ENGINEERING ■ PHYSICS
■ CHEMISTRY ■ METALLURGY ■ CERAMICS ■ MATHEMATICS ■ ENGI
NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS.
Tire field still broadens. The challenge grows greater. And a future of recognition
and advancement may be here for you.
