# Student Travel Center Provides World Study, Tour Information
## 
### 
The back room of the HR Shack
has undergone a complete trans
formation this year.
In place of dusty floors, dirty
windows, and disorganized piles
of books bound for Africa are
cotton drapes on the window’s, a
rug on the floor, travel posters on
the walls, and numerous files of
reading material with accommo
dations for using them. This is
the new Student Travel Center,
one of the services of the Stanford
Overseas Information Service.
“THE CENTER,” according to
Fred Morris, its director, “has
meen developed to further the

purposes of the HR by promoting
better international relations
through personal contacts be
tween young Americans and peo
ples in other parts of tho world.”
The Travel Center, which looks
a little like a regular travel agen
cy with its travel posters, racks of
complimentary travel brochures,
and a model jet sent as advertis
ing by an airline, attempts to ac
complish its goals by making
readily available to Stanford stu
dents an ever increasing amount
of information on work, study and
travel abroad.
The information, which comes

from some 300 sources, is divided
into nine general categories, with
one student travel counselor re
sponsible for each. The categories
are; Northern Europe, Southern
Europe, Germany and the Com
munist countries, South and Cen
tral America, the Far East and
South Pacific, the Middle East
and Africa, student travel organ
izations and work overseas, world
universities, and student tours
and transportation. Each coun
selor is necessarily well acquaint
ed with his field and is generally
familiar with the entire library
of information. At least one coun
selor is on duty between 3 and 6
p.m. Monday through Friday.
Information x’equest forms fa
cilitate research on specific ques
tions submitted by prospective
travelers. The forms are given to
the appropriate travel counselor
who finds the answers and then
makes himself available for per
sonal consultation with the infor
mation seeker.

THE FILES include information
on some 70 countries, with details
on culture, points of interest, ac
commodations, customs and visa
regulations, and other items es
sential to the traveler. Data is also
provided on all kinds of transpor
tation throughout the world and
on opportunities for study in
other countries, including pro
grams at foreign universities as
well as those sponsored by Ameri
can organizations, such as the
Junior Year Abroad programs.
Students can get facts and ad
vice about all sorts of tours, from
first class gourmet excursions to
relatively adventurous student
bus tours. For those who want to
spend some time in a certain coun
try and know the language, work
ing often affords the perfect con
ditions. The Travel Center is in
contact with many student organ
izations which arrange for job ex
changes in all part of the world,
as well as with the appropriate
government officials of many
countries.

“Something entirely new this
year,” related Morris, “is the per
sonal contact service. One of the
best ways to encourage a student
to travel and also to prepare for
it is to put him into contact with
someone who has already done
something similar to what he is
planning. We have students
around this campus who have had
such diversified experiences as
studying in foreign universities,
working in Berlin refugee camps,
and hitchhiking around the world.
Almost without exception they
are extremely enthusiastic about
their experiences and more than
happy to speak with prospective
wanderers.”

MORRIS feels that the success
of the center is “almost inevitable.
Such a student travel center,” he
continues, “is unique in that it is
not commercial. We're in an es
pecially good position to give gen
erally unavailable information
about the inexpensive travel.

Travel Center in the IiR shack.
The back room of the HR Shack
has undergone a complete trans
formation this year.
In place of dusty floors, dirty
windows, and disorganized piles
of books bound for Africa are
cotton drapes on the window’s, a
rug on the floor, travel posters on
the walls, and numerous files of
reading material with accommo
dations for using them. This is
the new Student Travel Center,
one of the services of the Stanford
Overseas Information Service.
“THE CENTER,” according to
Fred Morris, its director, “has
meen developed to further the

purposes of the HR by promoting
better international relations
through personal contacts be
tween young Americans and peo
ples in other parts of tho world.”
The Travel Center, which looks
a little like a regular travel agen
cy with its travel posters, racks of
complimentary travel brochures,
and a model jet sent as advertis
ing by an airline, attempts to ac
complish its goals by making
readily available to Stanford stu
dents an ever increasing amount
of information on work, study and
travel abroad.
The information, which comes

from some 300 sources, is divided
into nine general categories, with
one student travel counselor re
sponsible for each. The categories
are; Northern Europe, Southern
Europe, Germany and the Com
munist countries, South and Cen
tral America, the Far East and
South Pacific, the Middle East
and Africa, student travel organ
izations and work overseas, world
universities, and student tours
and transportation. Each coun
selor is necessarily well acquaint
ed with his field and is generally
familiar with the entire library
of information. At least one coun
selor is on duty between 3 and 6
p.m. Monday through Friday.
Information x’equest forms fa
cilitate research on specific ques
tions submitted by prospective
travelers. The forms are given to
the appropriate travel counselor
who finds the answers and then
makes himself available for per
sonal consultation with the infor
mation seeker.

THE FILES include information
on some 70 countries, with details
on culture, points of interest, ac
commodations, customs and visa
regulations, and other items es
sential to the traveler. Data is also
provided on all kinds of transpor
tation throughout the world and
on opportunities for study in
other countries, including pro
grams at foreign universities as
well as those sponsored by Ameri
can organizations, such as the
Junior Year Abroad programs.
Students can get facts and ad
vice about all sorts of tours, from
first class gourmet excursions to
relatively adventurous student
bus tours. For those who want to
spend some time in a certain coun
try and know the language, work
ing often affords the perfect con
ditions. The Travel Center is in
contact with many student organ
izations which arrange for job ex
changes in all part of the world,
as well as with the appropriate
government officials of many
countries.

“Something entirely new this
year,” related Morris, “is the per
sonal contact service. One of the
best ways to encourage a student
to travel and also to prepare for
it is to put him into contact with
someone who has already done
something similar to what he is
planning. We have students
around this campus who have had
such diversified experiences as
studying in foreign universities,
working in Berlin refugee camps,
and hitchhiking around the world.
Almost without exception they
are extremely enthusiastic about
their experiences and more than
happy to speak with prospective
wanderers.”

“Something entirely new this
year,” related Morris, “is the per
sonal contact service. One of the
best ways to encourage a student
to travel and also to prepare for
it is to put him into contact with
someone who has already done
something similar to what he is
planning. We have students
around this campus who have had
such diversified experiences as
studying in foreign universities,
working in Berlin refugee camps,
and hitchhiking around the world.
Almost without exception they
are extremely enthusiastic about
their experiences and more than
happy to speak with prospective
wanderers.”

MORRIS feels that the success
of the center is “almost inevitable.
Such a student travel center,” he
continues, “is unique in that it is
not commercial. We're in an es
pecially good position to give gen
erally unavailable information
about the inexpensive travel.

Travel Center in the IiR shack.
The back room of the HR Shack
has undergone a complete trans
formation this year.
In place of dusty floors, dirty
windows, and disorganized piles
of books bound for Africa are
cotton drapes on the window’s, a
rug on the floor, travel posters on
the walls, and numerous files of
reading material with accommo
dations for using them. This is
the new Student Travel Center,
one of the services of the Stanford
Overseas Information Service.
“THE CENTER,” according to
Fred Morris, its director, “has
meen developed to further the

purposes of the HR by promoting
better international relations
through personal contacts be
tween young Americans and peo
ples in other parts of tho world.”
The Travel Center, which looks
a little like a regular travel agen
cy with its travel posters, racks of
complimentary travel brochures,
and a model jet sent as advertis
ing by an airline, attempts to ac
complish its goals by making
readily available to Stanford stu
dents an ever increasing amount
of information on work, study and
travel abroad.
The information, which comes

from some 300 sources, is divided
into nine general categories, with
one student travel counselor re
sponsible for each. The categories
are; Northern Europe, Southern
Europe, Germany and the Com
munist countries, South and Cen
tral America, the Far East and
South Pacific, the Middle East
and Africa, student travel organ
izations and work overseas, world
universities, and student tours
and transportation. Each coun
selor is necessarily well acquaint
ed with his field and is generally
familiar with the entire library
of information. At least one coun
selor is on duty between 3 and 6
p.m. Monday through Friday.
Information x’equest forms fa
cilitate research on specific ques
tions submitted by prospective
travelers. The forms are given to
the appropriate travel counselor
who finds the answers and then
makes himself available for per
sonal consultation with the infor
mation seeker.

THE FILES include information
on some 70 countries, with details
on culture, points of interest, ac
commodations, customs and visa
regulations, and other items es
sential to the traveler. Data is also
provided on all kinds of transpor
tation throughout the world and
on opportunities for study in
other countries, including pro
grams at foreign universities as
well as those sponsored by Ameri
can organizations, such as the
Junior Year Abroad programs.
Students can get facts and ad
vice about all sorts of tours, from
first class gourmet excursions to
relatively adventurous student
bus tours. For those who want to
spend some time in a certain coun
try and know the language, work
ing often affords the perfect con
ditions. The Travel Center is in
contact with many student organ
izations which arrange for job ex
changes in all part of the world,
as well as with the appropriate
government officials of many
countries.
