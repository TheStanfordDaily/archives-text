T of the Commit-
Jchwarz will speak
*jonsored by the Po
aion.
i nurman, Sayler and Agnes
Nohrnberg, director of public
events for the Committee, stress
ed that Lima’s Communist affili
ation and Mandel’s liberal posi
tion were not the reasons for the
refusal to allow the debate.
Lima is the admitted head of
the Northern California Commu
nist Pai’ty and Mandel is a radio
commentator in Berkeley who in
voked the Fifth Amendment when
questioned by the House Un-
American Activities Committee
in San Francisco in May of 1960.

CONFLICTING requests to
stage a debate between Schwarz,
a right-wing Australian physician
now devoting full time to putting
on ant i-Communism schools
around the nation, and an oppo
nent from the left, were turned
in to the Committee by different
factions of Political Union during
Christmas vacation.

One request came from Vic
Preisser, the Union’s business
manager. He asked to bring Lima
and Schwarz together, and turned
in the required official forms to
Public Exercises.

The other request came from
Ross Hermann of the Conserva
tive Caucus, who wanted to pre
sent Mandel and Schwarz in a
debate. Hermann did not turn in
the official papers because he was
unable to obtain the signatures of
vacationing Poli Union President
Lawrie Chickering and Preisser.
But Mandel had agreed to appear
and Hermann’s request was con
sidered by the Committee.

IN THIS TIME, however,
Schwarz had told an audience in
Palo Alto and other groups he
talked to that he definitely would
debate Mandel here Jan. 22, and
urged them to attend.
The Committee considered the
two requests at its meeting last
Friday and okayed Schwarz’s
coming here but did not okay
Lima or Mandel.
Thurman said the Committee
believed the main interest center
ed in bringing Schwarz to the
campus and his appearance was
approved unanimously although
some members voiced disagree
ment with Schwarz’s views.
Some members of the Commit
tee also disapproved of the “ad
vertising” aspect of Schwarz’s
Stanford speech just before his
Jan. 29 to Fob, 2 School of Anti
communism in Oakland. This,
however, is the only time he will
be free to come to Stanford, the
sponsors said.
THE FIVE STUDENT members
of the Committee present and
other faculty and administration
members held, however, that, ac
cording to Sayler, “more heat
than light” would be shed with
men of such far-apart views op
posing each other in a debate.
They also thought the time limit
of an hour or an hour and a half
would hamper the discussion.
Thurman said the complaint
that both Lima and Schwarz were

“paid propagandists” of a cause
also was mentioned as a reason
against their appearance.
Sayler reported that when the
question of Lima’s Communist
connection was brought up in re
lation to whether he should bo
allowed to appear on campus,
several members of the Commit
tee immediately replied that be
ing a Communist should not bar
a person from speaking at Stan
ford.

BUT, he said, “no one really
went for” the idea that Schwarz
or Lima or Mandel should be ban
ned because of his views.
Thurman said the Committee
undoubtedly would welcome the
application of a speaker to oppose
Schwarz's opinions after he has
appeared here.
Earlier yesterday, reports cir
culated that Schwarz had been
barred from campus, and the Uni
versity issued a short statement
telling of the approval for his talk
here.
