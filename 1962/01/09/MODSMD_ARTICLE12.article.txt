We are disturbed, however, at the decision
made. It seems to us that if a student group h

allowing the debate with Schwarz, and it is possible tiuu

And, of course, the Committee is laying itself wide open to
charges of undue interference in a student program (with which
we agree) and rejecting speakers because of their views (with
which we do not agree).
If the Committee’s reasoning in this case is to be a criterion for
judging the suitability of a student political program, we imagine
it could find other cases where it could apply the same measuring
stick and not allow a discussion or debate. But anything which
hampers debate or discussion, particularly on topics of such im
portance and timeliness as “Resolved: Communist Faculty Mem
bers Should Be Dismissed” (which was to have been the Schwarz
debate subject)—is an infringement on freedom of speech and
academic freedom. Any inroad on these freedoms cannot be tol
erated, especially at a university.
We urge a student group to choose a speaker—Lima or Mandel
or any other opponent of Schwarz’s warped views—and bring him
to Stanford. We are confident Public Exercises would have no
objection, as long as the correct procedures for presenting a
speaker on campus are followed.
