# INDIVIDUAL OPINION
## Nehru Should Renounce His Gandhian Non-Violence Policy 
### ROSS HERMANN Daily Staff Writer 
Prior to India’s invasion of Goa,
Prime Minister Nehru had this to
say about Indian policy toward
the tiny Portuguese colony:

"What are the basic elements of
our policy in regard to Goa? We
rule out non-peaceful methods
completely.”
“The moment a good thing is
done by imposition, it becomes a
bad thing.”
“Once we accept the position
that we can use the army for the
solution of our problems, we can
not deny the same right to other
countries. It is a question of prin
ciple.”

“FROM THE OUTSET our poli
cy, both at home and abroad, has
been to solve all problems peace
fully. If we ourselves act against
that policy we would be regarded
as deceitful hypocrites. It would
be said that we say one thing and
do another.”
After the invasion of Goa ended
in success, Nehru said jubilantly
that there was ‘‘full justification”
for the use of force against the
Portuguese.
‘‘Nothing in the 14 years of (In
dian) independence has excited
and thrilled the people in India as
the liberation of Goa.”
He added that he had no doubt
about India’s right to militarily
force the Portuguese out of Goa.

AND TO ANYONE who tried
to point out the inconsistency of
his position, Nehru declared, “My
being preached at about non-vi
olence by people who know noth
ing about it is amazing.” As he
said this, the self-appointed oracle
on the proper definition and prac

tice of pacifism angrily pounded
the table with his fist.
But while the Indians were
overrunning token opposition in
Goa, Nehru was allowing Red
Chinese troops to occupy a seized
area of India’s northern frontier
many times the size of Goa.
How easy it was for him to di
rect military action against an en
clave like Goa where little oppo
sition could be expected to ma
terialize.

IT WOULD HAVE required far
more courage and conviction for
India to confront and repel the
Red Chinese invaders, whose re
peated aggression is as much a
matter of principle for India as
Portugal’s occupation of Goa.
Ousting the northern invaders
would really thrill the Indian peo
ple, if that is a proper criterion
for undertaking military action;
and furthermore, it would be fully
justified under international law.

But that issue, Nehru tells us,
must be handled by peaceful
means, presumably because it
would be a far more difficult task
than the conquest of Goa.
IF NEHRU IS ever again
praised as a man of principle and
peace, it can be said that he is a
deceitful hypocrite and his philos
ophy, as he practices it, a guise
for cowardice.

The only way he can now re
gain a measure of his lost stature
is to formally renounce his
Gandhian philosophy of non-vi
olence, already destroyed by his
invasion of Goa, and to become
active and aggressive in protect
ing and defending India’s national
interests against, not only the
weakly Portuguese, but all com
ers.

said this, the self-appointed oracle
on the proper definition and prac

tice of pacifism angrily pounded
the table with his fist.
But while the Indians were
overrunning token opposition in
Goa, Nehru was allowing Red
Chinese troops to occupy a seized
area of India’s northern frontier
many times the size of Goa.
How easy it was for him to di
rect military action against an en
clave like Goa where little oppo
sition could be expected to ma
terialize.

IT WOULD HAVE required far
more courage and conviction for
India to confront and repel the
Red Chinese invaders, whose re
peated aggression is as much a
matter of principle for India as
Portugal’s occupation of Goa.
Ousting the northern invaders
would really thrill the Indian peo
ple, if that is a proper criterion
for undertaking military action;
and furthermore, it would be fully
justified under international law.

But that issue, Nehru tells us,
must be handled by peaceful
means, presumably because it
would be a far more difficult task
than the conquest of Goa.
IF NEHRU IS ever again
praised as a man of principle and
peace, it can be said that he is a
deceitful hypocrite and his philos
ophy, as he practices it, a guise
for cowardice.

The only way he can now re
gain a measure of his lost stature
is to formally renounce his
Gandhian philosophy of non-vi
olence, already destroyed by his
invasion of Goa, and to become
active and aggressive in protect
ing and defending India’s national
interests against, not only the
weakly Portuguese, but all com
ers.
Prior to India’s invasion of Goa,
Prime Minister Nehru had this to
say about Indian policy toward
the tiny Portuguese colony:

"What are the basic elements of
our policy in regard to Goa? We
rule out non-peaceful methods
completely.”
“The moment a good thing is
done by imposition, it becomes a
bad thing.”
“Once we accept the position
that we can use the army for the
solution of our problems, we can
not deny the same right to other
countries. It is a question of prin
ciple.”

“FROM THE OUTSET our poli
cy, both at home and abroad, has
been to solve all problems peace
fully. If we ourselves act against
that policy we would be regarded
as deceitful hypocrites. It would
be said that we say one thing and
do another.”
After the invasion of Goa ended
in success, Nehru said jubilantly
that there was ‘‘full justification”
for the use of force against the
Portuguese.
‘‘Nothing in the 14 years of (In
dian) independence has excited
and thrilled the people in India as
the liberation of Goa.”
He added that he had no doubt
about India’s right to militarily
force the Portuguese out of Goa.

AND TO ANYONE who tried
to point out the inconsistency of
his position, Nehru declared, “My
being preached at about non-vi
olence by people who know noth
ing about it is amazing.” As he
said this, the self-appointed oracle
on the proper definition and prac

tice of pacifism angrily pounded
the table with his fist.
