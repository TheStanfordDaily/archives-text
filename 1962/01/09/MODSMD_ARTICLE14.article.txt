in cooperation with the Stanford
Today and Tomorrow Committee
on various aspects of Farm Life,
Students with a question on any
part of Stanford operations or
Stanford life in general should
send them to Box 3845.

QUESTION: What is the Stan
ford house plan?
Answered by Dr. Wilfred Stone,
faculty resident at Stern.
A house differs from a frater
nity or eating club mainly in its
intention to be a direct extension
of the educational process and not
something different from or mere
ly tangential to it. A house aims to

LOii.niuii
ly pre\ L n the class
room and the residence hall, be
tween intellectual and social life,
between teacher and taught. And
it aims to do this not spasmodic
ally, not just through occasional
speakers or faculty visitors, but
continually, through creating a
way of life in which this joining
is natural and inevitable.
The houses at Stanford have ac
tive social and athletic programs,
but they also have active intellec
tual and cultural programs—and
they see no contradiction between
the two.

Vital to this coming together
are the faculty associates. Most
houses have a number of faculty
members who have agreed to dine
often in the halls and who have
identified themselves with the life
and growth of their houses—and
with the students in them. These
faculty are permanent members
of the houses, and their associa
tion is a long-term one, not sea
sonal. So the students in these
houses need not complain that at
Stanford they never got to know
a faculty member personally.
IN THE HOUSE plan—when it
is fully working—faculty come
built in, and the student can know
them as friends and associates,
casually and informally.

Resident assistants are a kind of
junior faculty. They are senior
graduate students, with serious
scholarly aspirations, who live
with the students and who have
been selected as men of maturity,
intelligence, and good judgment.
They are advisors and friends to
the men of the house—who are
also examples of the kind of men

the house plan hopes to tin
But a house is essentially its
student members, and the way of
life they create for themselves. A
house is a free, small society. It
is free to govern itself, to handle
its own discipline, and to make
of its intellectual and cultural op
portunities what it wishes. It can
go jock or egghead, and no one
will stop it.
BUT MOST houses are tending
to merge these two tendencies,
and to make the discovery that,
in the business of getting an edu
cation. any hard and fast distinc
tions between play and work
make little sense. The tensions
and anxieties of acquiring knowl
edge are also, when shared in
sympathetic company, a source of
joy. It is the ongoing conversa
tion, the vigorous sharing of the
intellectual ferment of our time,
that gives a house its essential
character. And it is this impulse
that fills the house libraries, that
brings discussions to the lounges,
that sprinkles the dining halls
with faculty guests (other than
the faculty associates and R.A.’s)
who are invited (at University ex
pense) by students.
One last point. The Stanford
house plan differs from fraterni
ties and eating clubs in one im
portant matter of principle: it
holds that the man should choose
the house and not (he house the
man. It believes that if a man has
been accepted by Stanford Uni
versity he is good enough for
membership in our society.
IT BELIEVES, further, that the
experience of living together
should be an experience of meet
ing people different from oneself
—that rich and poor, black and
white, Jew and Gentile, foreigner
and American, Easterner and
Westerner, tall and short, urban
ite and provincial, should be cast
together, and rub shoulders to
gether, in an abrasive action that
might create friendships and
might create hostilities, but that
would be, at any rate, a realistic
sample of the human condition
and not one where all the faces
and all the status symbols are the
same.
