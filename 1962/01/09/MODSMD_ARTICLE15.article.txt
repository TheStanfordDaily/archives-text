SHELL. PLATFORM
Editor, The Daily;
In your editorial analysis and
rejection of the platform of state
gubernatorial candidate Joseph
Shell, you have failed to take into
consideration one of Mr. Shell’s
most important charges.
Shell stated in his speech Thurs
day that one of the main reasons
California is faced with a mount
ing unemployment problem
(which is by the way, a chief
area of state welfare relief) is be
cause the Brown administration’s
high state taxes on commerce and
industry have created in Califor
nit a steadily worsening business
climate, and that because of this
climate, not only do industries
planning to locate new plants in
this state “think twice” and de
cide against California, but, also,
industries which are already lo
cated in the state are leaving Cal
ifornia for states where corpor
ate taxation levels permit them to
make greater profits.
As Shell pointed out, whereas
most industries can easily trans
fer operations to new locations,
the working people who have
been employed by these industries
in California often cannot. Thus,
these working people, because
their jobs have moved to Ohio or
Texas, have little choice but to
join the swelling number of un
employment relief recipients in
this state.

Assemblyman Shell’s solution
is to strike at the heart of the
problem by returning California
to a healthy business climate,
rather than by prolonging and ac
centuating the problem with
greater doses of welfare.
