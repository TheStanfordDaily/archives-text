### PETE KING 
The Northern California Basketball Writers’ Association yester
day honored Stanford’s ace center, Tom Dose, at its weekly lunch
eon by naming him as the player of the week.
The award came after Dose’s outstanding 52-point performance
in two games last week against the Oregon Ducks. Dose is cur-

rently averaging almost 20 points
per game for the Indians.
Present at the luncheon were
Howie Dallmar, Stanford coach,
and Rene Herrerias, coach for
Cal. Both had high praise for the
big, 6-8 Card sophomore, who al
ready has Stanford’s highest scor
ing average in a decade.
“TO.>l DOSE is the best sopho
more under seven feet that I've
seen,” remarked Herrerias. “He
will undoubtedly be one of the
best to come out of Stanford. His
play resembles that of Ohio
State’s Jerry Lucas. You aren’t
aware that he’s in the game, but
all of a sudden he’s got 20 or 25
points.”
Dose’s own coach, Dallmar, said

that he’d never seen a softer shot
than Dose’s.
Commenting on this Friday’s
upcoming clash between Stanford
and Cal at Stanford’s gym. Her
rerias was pessimistic. “Stanford
will he tough, especially after our
losses to Southern Cal, but we
sure could surprise. Physically,
USC was the best team we’ve
played all year, but I won’t com
pare the two teams until after
we’ve played Stanford.”
OALLMAR TOLD Herrerias
consolingly, “Be patient. Those
wins will eventually come.” Of
course he wasn’t referring to this
Friday’s Big Game.

TOM DOSE
Northern California basketballer
of the week.
The Northern California Basketball Writers’ Association yester
day honored Stanford’s ace center, Tom Dose, at its weekly lunch
eon by naming him as the player of the week.
The award came after Dose’s outstanding 52-point performance
in two games last week against the Oregon Ducks. Dose is cur-

rently averaging almost 20 points
per game for the Indians.
Present at the luncheon were
Howie Dallmar, Stanford coach,
and Rene Herrerias, coach for
Cal. Both had high praise for the
big, 6-8 Card sophomore, who al
ready has Stanford’s highest scor
ing average in a decade.
“TO.>l DOSE is the best sopho
more under seven feet that I've
seen,” remarked Herrerias. “He
will undoubtedly be one of the
best to come out of Stanford. His
play resembles that of Ohio
State’s Jerry Lucas. You aren’t
aware that he’s in the game, but
all of a sudden he’s got 20 or 25
points.”
Dose’s own coach, Dallmar, said

that he’d never seen a softer shot
than Dose’s.
Commenting on this Friday’s
upcoming clash between Stanford
and Cal at Stanford’s gym. Her
rerias was pessimistic. “Stanford
will he tough, especially after our
losses to Southern Cal, but we
sure could surprise. Physically,
USC was the best team we’ve
played all year, but I won’t com
pare the two teams until after
we’ve played Stanford.”
OALLMAR TOLD Herrerias
consolingly, “Be patient. Those
wins will eventually come.” Of
course he wasn’t referring to this
Friday’s Big Game.
