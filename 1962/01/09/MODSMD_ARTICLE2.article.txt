ISTANBUL, Turkey (UPD—A
Belgian jet airliner with 27 per
sons aboard was intercepted by
Soviet Mig jet fighters Monday
along the Soviet-Turkish border
and forced to land at Yerevan,
capital of Soviet Armenia, official

sources reported. One American
was reported aboard.
There was no word on whether
the Soviet Migs had opened fire
on the French-built Caravelle
which was flying erratically with
a defective radio compass on an
850-mile flight from Tehran to Is
tanbul. Soviet planes opened fire
on two U.S. Air Force planes in
that area in 1958.

In Moscow, Belgian Embassy
offcials said they were trying to
win the release of the crewmen
and passengers but had received
no word from the Soviet foreign
ministry and expected none be
fore Tuesday morning.
Reports reaching Moscow from
Yerevan said the Belgian plane
landed at a military airfield near
the city and that an inquiry was
being held there by an official
j from the Soviet internal affairs
ministry.

In the two American incidents,
a CllB was forced to crash land
on June 27, 1958, after to strayed
across the tense border area in
bad weather. On Sept. 2, a Cl3O
was shot down by Soviet fighters
near the Turkish bolder.
Airport authorities said the Bel
gian Sabena jet airliner was 19
minutes out of Tehran when it re
ported its radio compass was in
operative. Gela/.ig airport in east
ern Turkey said the last contact
with the plane came when the
pilot radioed: “I have to follow
Mig fighters. I believe they are
taking me to Russia.”
In Tehran, officials said an
American namd “Howen” was
aboard the plane. They identified
another passenger as Farhad Ma
soudi, editor of the Tehran Eng
lish language newspaper Tehran
Journal.

Airport and Belgian officials
here said the regularly-scheduled
flight with 19 passengers and
eight crewmen aboard apparently
was flying in heavy winds and
strayed into Armenia near a point
where Iran, Soviet Armenia and
Turkey meet.
