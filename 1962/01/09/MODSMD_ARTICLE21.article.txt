# New Ruggers Bolster Championship Squad
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Preparing to defend their 1961
California rugby championship
arc the members of this year’s
edition of the Stanford varsity
rugby squad.

The Indian rugbymen formally
open their season this Saturday
with a clash against the Califor
nia Bears at Berkeley.

LAST SATURDAY coach Pete
Kmetovic's charges participated
in an informal rugby carnival
held on the Card turf as prepara
tion for the upcoming season.

Stanford looked ready to take
up where it left off last year with
two high scoring wins in abbre
viated scrimmages against St.
Mary’s (11-0) and the Peninsula
Ramblers (16-0). Other squads
testing themselves included Santa
Clara and the University of the
Pacific.

Though Kmetovic hopes this
season’s ruggers will be on a par
with last year's, Stanford will
have to be truly outstanding to
top the 1961 squad’s 13 won and
only one lost record.

LOSING ONLY to California
(by one point), the Indians scored
impressive wins over nearly every
team in California, including a
win over the Berkeley Bears in a
second meeting and a title in the

annual Monterey Rugby Tourna
ment.
Last season Stanford oulscored
its opponents by an unbelievable
189 to 43 margin with nearly half
at these (94) coming off the toe
of Kyrk Reid.
Unfortunately Reid will not re
turn this year, and his loss along
with that of such fine backs as
Rick McMillcn, Larry Royse,
Dale Ostrander and Jack McCul
lough could cause some problems
for the present group of ruggers.
ON THE PLUS side, however,
is the fact that, except for John
Clark, Sam Pike and Don Peter,
the Indians will have nearly their
entire scrum back to give them
one of the most experienced front
lines in the area.

John Thomas, one of last year’s
stickouts is running in front for
Reid’s vacated hooker position,
but must boat out a promising
graduate engineer from England,
Peter Faber.

Stan Lindskog seems to have
inherited Reid’s kicking duties. A
solid place-kicker for the football
team, Lindskog booted well last
weekend in the rugby carnival
and should do well in a position
that practically carries a guaran
tee of being a high scorer.
TWO VETERANS in Troy Bar
bee and Randy Vahan are at the
prop spots, but Gary Lofgren
should also see plenty -of action
there.

Jon Brandin, another veteran,
and footballer Frank Atkinson are
heading the candidates for second

rankers, followed by Randy Dev
ening, Al Hijdehtrand and Dick
Leeuwenhurg.

Steve Pursell, Tim Hansel and
John Butler are battling for the
two breakaway berths, while Roll
Price holds down the scrum half
position.
IN THE BACKPIELD, Tom Me
Manus, who may spell Lindskog
as kicker will line up at first 5/8
beside Hal Steuber, another of the
many Card gridders playing rug
by, at second 5/8.
Lindskog will pDay the center
3/4 position, and Chuck Cobb and
Jim Epstein fly at the wings. Rod
Scars completes the lineup of
backs at fullback.

Among the other hackfield
hopefuls who could break into
the opening lineup are Hank Mc-
Quden, a transfer from the Air

Force Academy, Clark Weaver,
from the University of Colorado,
and George Molett, Kurt Hauser,
Tony DeLellis, Jay Ward, Diek
Shaw and Jim Shroyer.

WITH GOOD height in (he
scrum, somewhat of a weakness
last year, along with good experi
ence, the Card ruggers need only
kicking measuring up to Reid’s
and a back to fill McMillen’s shoes
in order to come up with another
very fine season.

All of the Indians’ home eon
tests will he played on the rugby
field in back of the Sunken Base
ball Diamond and will be free of
charge with the exception of the
meetings with UCLA on Feb. 10,
California on Mar. 3 and I JSC on
Mar. 10.

Most contests will he preceded
by a junior varsity contest.
