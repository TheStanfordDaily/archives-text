Stanford announced just after
Christmas a pledged gift of $230,-
000 from Thomas F. Peterson, en
gineering executive and philan

Materials Science Laboratory in
the School of Engineering.
The laboratory, expected to fig
ure importantly in the develop
ment of now working substances
required by the speeds and
stresses of the space age, is one
of the objectives of Stanford’s
PACE program.

Stanford trustees voted to name
the laboratory “The Thomas F.
Peterson Engineering Labora
tory.” It will be established in a
completely renovated existing
building south of the Main Quad
rangle.

The Peterson pledge assures
completion of the laboratory proj
ect which will be partially fi

Foundation and the Ford Foun

The Peterson Laboratory will
be opposite the site for the new
$2.5 million building to house re
search and teaching programs for
the proposed Center for Materials
Research and for the Stanford
School of Engineering.
