If computers process data in mathematical terms, how
can they be instructed to handle information and ap
plications that are not essentially arithmetic? IBM, in
cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, is finding some
answers through research in automatic language
translation systems.
Machinetranslationof idioms, forexample, is teaching
us a great deal about information processing. An idio
matic phrase may have a meaning quite different from
the sum of its individual words, and a system that mere
ly matches these words won’t come close to translating
it. One solution is an “expanded electronic dictionary”
that contains idioms and grammatical instructions as
well as single words. Work is now under way to clarify
meaning further by automatic syntactical analysis.
Systems research such as this requires its own kind
of translation—the translation of an idea into a working
system. For people with this ability, who like to travel
beyond the boundaries of their specialized areas, IBM
offers unusual opportunity. If you’re interested in
any of the fields in which IBM is making important
advances —semiconductors, microwaves, magnetics,
superconductivity— and your major is in engineering
or one of the sciences, you are invited to talk with the
IBM representative. He will be interviewing on your
campus this year. Your placement office can make an
appointment. All qualified applicants will receive con

cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, is finding some
answers through research in automatic language
translation systems.
Machinetranslationof idioms, forexample, is teaching
us a great deal about information processing. An idio
matic phrase may have a meaning quite different from
the sum of its individual words, and a system that mere
ly matches these words won’t come close to translating
it. One solution is an “expanded electronic dictionary”
that contains idioms and grammatical instructions as
well as single words. Work is now under way to clarify
meaning further by automatic syntactical analysis.
Systems research such as this requires its own kind
of translation—the translation of an idea into a working
system. For people with this ability, who like to travel
beyond the boundaries of their specialized areas, IBM
offers unusual opportunity. If you’re interested in
any of the fields in which IBM is making important
advances —semiconductors, microwaves, magnetics,
superconductivity— and your major is in engineering
or one of the sciences, you are invited to talk with the
IBM representative. He will be interviewing on your
campus this year. Your placement office can make an
appointment. All qualified applicants will receive con
sideration for employment without regard to race,
creed, color or national origin. Write, outlining your
background and interests, to: Mgr. of Technical Em
ployment, Dept. 898, IBM Corporation, 590 Madison
Avenue, New York 22, N. Y.
