President Wallace Sterling will
address students and faculty
members in the first all-universi
ty convocation of 1962, today at
11 in Memorial Auditorium.

Appropriate to the beginning of

view ‘‘The State of the Universi
ty,” touching upon major accom
plishments, current projects and
matters of conflict in important
policies and decisions at Stanford.
THE PRESIDENTIAL address
is the first part of a program
which is sponsored by Stanford
Today and Tomorrow, and which
will continue tonight and tomor
row night with student-faculty
seminars in campus living groups.
Discussions are expected to
cover a broad area of student
concern, ranging from questions
about the functions of the Trus
tees to complaints about women’s
(living accommodations. Follow
ing are a few of the subjects open
to discussion and questioning:
—The state of undergraduate
education. What proportion of
university expansion is being al
lotted to the improvemnt of un
dergraduate facilities? How much
uniformity is there in the basic
criteria for grading at Stanford?
Why isn’t Dead Week really dead?
Social and academic freedom.
Is Stanford’s motto, ‘‘The Winds

of Freedom Blow,” still alive in
all spheres of university activity?
Is it possible that such a colossal
fund-raising campaign as PACE
could proceed without restricting
the freedom of students and fac
ulty members? Does Stanford ac
cept government money with loy
alty oath stipulations?
