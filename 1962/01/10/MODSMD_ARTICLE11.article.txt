# Living Groups to Match Brains In Campus-Wide Debate Tourney
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Intramural competition for ath
letes has long been an accepted
part of Stanford life, but so far no
similar program of intramurals
for intellectuals has been devised.
Tho speech association is intro
ducing such a program this quar
ter an inter-living group debate
tournament. Called “Issues of
Challenge ’62,” the contest will
be open to one loam from each
Stanford living group, male or fe
male.
THE PROPOSITION for debate
is: “Resolved, That the Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee of the
United States House of Repre
sentatives should be abolished.”
Each living group team must
be composed of one affirmative
and one negative speaker. The
two will debate representatives of
other living groups separately,
but in considering awards, the
record of the team as a whole will
be the deciding factor.
As an example of the way the
tournament will work, a typical
evening might find one member
of tho Zete team defending the
Un-American Activities Commit
tee in a debate at the Sigma Nu
house, while the other Zole up
holds the affirmative on tho prop
osition against a negatively-mind
ed Roble dollie, before an audi
ence in the Roble lounge.
After several preliminary
rounds, the best teams will bo se
lected to compete in the quarter-,
semi-, and final eliminations. Tro
phies will be awarded to the most
outstanding speakers and living

groups.
TOURNAMENT DIRECTORS
for "Issues of Challenge—’62” are
Mike Hall and Dave Commons.
According to Hall, this tourna
ment is intended to give an op
portunity to debate to those stu
dents who don’t feel they have
enough time to devote to inter
collegiate debate, or who have
little or no previous experience.
For this reason anyone who has
participated in inter-collegiate
forensics for more than two quar
ters will not be eligible. All other
undergraduates may participate.
Codirector Dave Commons
points out that “this will be the
only intramural activity in which
students have a chance to apply
that quality education for which
their parents are paying so
much.”

Dr. Jon M. Ericson, Director of
Forensics, will kick the program
off with a lecture on the tech
niques of debate next Monday,
Jan. 15. Wednesday evening, Jan.
17, Barry Carter will take the af
firmative against Mike Hall, in a
demonstration debate on the top
ic.

Preliminary debates are sched
uled to begin Jan. 22, with quar
terfinal eliminations starting Feb.
12 and leading to the champion
ship debate on Thursday, Mar. 1.
CHAIRMEN HAVE been ap
pointed for each type of living
group, and should be contacted
by any house or club interested
in participating. Larry Neal of
Breakers is in charge of eating
club entries, while Jim VVoolsey

of Sigma Nu and Frank Ker of
Alpha Sig represent the row.
Freshman houses should get in
touch with Bill Noyes, Soto spon
sor. Don Boileau is the Stern
chairman.

On the distaff side, Edith Brown
of Lagunita will take care of con
testants from Lagunita and wom
en's row. Roble and Branner will
be handled by Dan Tarlock and
Florence Moore and Union by Bob
Mackey.

Since this is the first tourna
ment of its kind, it is naturally
next to impossible to pick win
ners. It is expected, however, that
strong entries will come from Sig
ma Nu, Phi Kappa Sigma, and
Zeta Psi, among the Greeks. Los
Arcos and Soto are also likely to
provide keen competition. The
women are an unknown quantity.
