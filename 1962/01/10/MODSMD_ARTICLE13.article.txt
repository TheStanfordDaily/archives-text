### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) The*
election-year session of Congress
opens today with President Ken
nedy and his legislative high com
mand agreed on a timetable call
ing for first action on his tax re
vision program.

The strategy, reached by Ken
nedy and Democratic congression
al leaders at a White House
breakfast meeting yesterday,
would put off until later show
downs on the President’s two
most controversial proposals
medical care for the aged and
broad new tariff-cutting authori
ty.

DEMOCRATIC chieftains
emerged from the conference pre
dicting Kennedy would be able to
push most of his program
through the second session of the
87th Congress. His victories and
setbacks will be a major issue in
the fall battle for control of the
next Congress.
Republicans have promised to
support the President on issues
involving the national security.
But they have made clear they
would oppose what they consider
excessive federal spending pro
grams. They specifically have
come out against Kennedy’s med
ical care proposal and taken a
cautious stand on trade policy.
Kennedy also told the meeting
he would have to ask Congress
for an increase in the $298 billion
national debt limit to permit the
Treasury to meet current ex
penses. The congressional leaders
assured him the request would
get immediate action.

HOUSE Democrats held a
special caucus and selected Rep.
John W. McCormack of Boston to
succeed the late Sam Rayburn of
Texas as speaker. The House will
officially elect McCormack today.
Rep. Carl Albert of Oklahoma
was picked to succeed McCor
mack as House Democratic lead
er.
In the Senate’s only leadership
contest, Sen. Bourke B. Hicken
looper of lowa appeared favored
to win the GOP policy chairman
ship vacated by the death of Sen.
Styles Bridges, N.H. Sen. Lever
ett Saltonstall. Mass., said he was
hopeful of winning the post and
did not intend to withdraw. The
election is today.
Democrats outnumber Republi
can in the House 258 to 174, with
five seats vacant. In the Senate,
there are 64 Democrats and 36
Republicans.
IN ADDITION to discussing
strategy for winning approval of
his legislative proposals, Kennedy
gave the White House meeting a
timetable for sending his program
to Congress.
McCormack said Kennedy
would submit on Jan. 18 his budg
et for the 12 months starting July
1 and would send up his annual
economic message Jan. 22. The
White House said later Kennedy
would submit special messages on
foreign trade and his farm pro
gram near the end of the month.
Other messages on specific issues
were expected.
