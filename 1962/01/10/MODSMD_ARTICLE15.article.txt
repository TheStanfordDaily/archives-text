# Dishonest TV Ads Should Be Stopped
## 
### 
The Federal Trade Commission must have shocked Madison
Avenue and the television industry when it ruled the other day
that TV ads must he honest, and that camera tricks or gimmicks
cannot be used to sell a product or demonstrate its merits.
This also must have come as a blow to soap makers, who lost
the market of the beer advertisers who now must use real beer
foam for the heads of beer we see on the tube—instead of soap
suds.

The UPI report of the FTC decision bears quoting in length
for it indicates what TV advertisers have gotten away with and
where the general level of ethics in Mr. Minnow’s “vast waste
land” rests:

Colgate-Palmolive and the Bates Agency were ordered to
refrain from using demonstrations on TV to advertise any product
unless the demonstration was genuine and accurately portrayed
the product’s qualities.
“The ruling stemmed from a series of TV commercials in late
1959 for ‘Palmolive Rapid Shave’ that appeared to show how,
coarse sandpaper could be shaved clean in a single stroke imme
diately after Palmolive . . . was applied.
“In its ruling, the FTC said the ‘sandpaper’ actually was a prop
composed of plexiglass covered with sand. It said tests showed
that real sandpaper could never be shaved clean no matter how
long the Palmolive . . . was allowed to soak.

“The commission overruled hearing Examiner William L. Pack,
who recommended dismissal of the false advertising complaint.
Pack said use of the plexiglass was justified because TV cameras
made real sandpaper look like plain paper.”
The FTC ruling was, UPI reports, a precedent-setting one.
This is heartening, for governmental agencies such as the FTC
and FCC too often in the past—particularly during the Eisenhower
Administration—have placed the interest of business before that
of the public.

This decision, and the example of an FCC chairman willing to
criticize and make constructive suggestions to those his agency
affects, indicates that the Kennedy Administration will use the
power of such agencies to protect the public and suggest to busi
ness how it might solve problems where business and the public
interest conflict.

It’s also reassuring to know that the FTC is willing to crack
clown when necessary. Hopefully, television advertisers will heed
the FTC call for a halt to “widespread and increasing use of de
ceptive and unfair advertising pratciccs in television.”

Certainly the necessity for the FTC’s statement (and the
quality of TV programs) indicates that the sanctimonious declara
tions of David Sarnoff and other TV executives that TV can police
itself have little relation to the truth of the matter.
