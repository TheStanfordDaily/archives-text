## Professor's Daughter Is a Barefoot Longhair

CLEVELAND, Ohio (UPI)
The recent revival of folk music
on (he nation’s campuses has led
to fame for many folk-style sing
ers in pop music. But on the ac
tual folk scene most newcomers
merely imitate the established
names.

One of the refreshingly new
voices in the newly popular field
belongs to Joan Baez, daughter of
a physics professor.
In the fall, 1958, Joan was a
freshman at the Boston Universi
ty Theatre School. Her bare feet,
long hair and bangs were appro
priate as she joined the many
guitar - strumming enthusiasts
singing in Harvard Square.
BY SPRING, 1959, Joan had
quit school—“I didn’t like it so I
flunked out”—and was appearing
in coffee houses and on stages in
the Boston area singing ballads.
She accompanied her concert
soprano voice with a not-so-new
guitar.
Joan also cut tapes for an al
bum later put out by some ambi
tious young Bostonians. It is
“Folk Music ‘Round Harvard
Square’” (Voritas).
Unlike most nearly-amateur
folkniks,’ Joan did her own ar
rangements and developed a
unique style, even when she per
formed numbers identified with
established folk musicians such
as Pete Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert,
Cynthia Gooding and Odetta.
Today, at 20, Joan still sings

barefoot, still does her arranging,
and has cut two more albums
(Vanguard).
SHE ALSO HAS completed a
concert tour which included an
appearance in Cleveland.
Her reputation among folk mu
sic connaisseurs is primarily from
her records and her appearances
at the 1959 and 1960 Newport,
R.1., Folk Festivals.
Miss Baez was born in New
York and reared in California.
Her ancestry is Mexlcan-Irish.
She attended Boston University
because her father then was
teaching at Harvard. Her parents
are now in Paris where her fa
ther is with UNESCO.
Joan specializes in ballads. Most
of her repertory is of American
or English origin. She is especially
fond of hillbilly music.
The folk singer is self-taught
on both the guitar and ukelele.
She credits the recent revival
of folk music to young people’s
desire to find an adequate means
of communication. “Or maybe
they’re just lazing around and
have nothing else to do.”
JOAN SPENDS most of her
time at homo in Big Sur, near
Monterey, Calif. She admits she
has a “fairly serious” boy friend
but won’t say much about him
because "he doesn’t like publi
city.”
Joan’s ambition?

“I’ll always sing, even if it’s
just in the bathtub. But I’d like
to get married and have babies.”

She accompanied her concert
soprano voice with a not-so-new
guitar.
Joan also cut tapes for an al
bum later put out by some ambi
tious young Bostonians. It is
“Folk Music ‘Round Harvard
Square’” (Voritas).
Unlike most nearly-amateur
folkniks,’ Joan did her own ar
rangements and developed a
unique style, even when she per
formed numbers identified with
established folk musicians such
as Pete Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert,
Cynthia Gooding and Odetta.
Today, at 20, Joan still sings

barefoot, still does her arranging,
and has cut two more albums
(Vanguard).
SHE ALSO HAS completed a
concert tour which included an
appearance in Cleveland.
Her reputation among folk mu
sic connaisseurs is primarily from
her records and her appearances
at the 1959 and 1960 Newport,
R.1., Folk Festivals.
Miss Baez was born in New
York and reared in California.
Her ancestry is Mexlcan-Irish.
She attended Boston University
because her father then was
teaching at Harvard. Her parents
are now in Paris where her fa
ther is with UNESCO.
Joan specializes in ballads. Most
of her repertory is of American
or English origin. She is especially
fond of hillbilly music.
The folk singer is self-taught
on both the guitar and ukelele.
She credits the recent revival
of folk music to young people’s
desire to find an adequate means
of communication. “Or maybe
they’re just lazing around and
have nothing else to do.”
JOAN SPENDS most of her
time at homo in Big Sur, near
Monterey, Calif. She admits she
has a “fairly serious” boy friend
but won’t say much about him
because "he doesn’t like publi
city.”
Joan’s ambition?

“I’ll always sing, even if it’s
just in the bathtub. But I’d like
to get married and have babies.”

The recent revival of folk music
on (he nation’s campuses has led
to fame for many folk-style sing
ers in pop music. But on the ac
tual folk scene most newcomers
merely imitate the established
names.

One of the refreshingly new
voices in the newly popular field
belongs to Joan Baez, daughter of
a physics professor.
In the fall, 1958, Joan was a
freshman at the Boston Universi

long hair and bangs were appro
priate as she joined the many
guitar - strumming enthusiasts
singing in Harvard Square.

quit school—“I didn’t like it so I
flunked out”—and was appearing
