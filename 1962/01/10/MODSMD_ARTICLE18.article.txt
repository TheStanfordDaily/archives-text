## Tanganyika Freedom 
### HILARY SIMS 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: The author

ate now studying at Makerere
College in Uganda).

Dec. 9 marked the emergence of
Tanganyika as the first independ
ent territory in British East Afri
ca. Initially a German possession,
Tanganyika was mandated to
Britain in 1920 and transferred to
trusteeship in 1945. Since World
War 11, Tanganyika has under
gone rapid political and economic
changes. Her sisal and coffee ex
ports bring in $56 million a year.
The success of the co-operative
coffee farming by the Chagga on
Mt. Kilimanjaro is a landmark in
the development of purely Afri
can enterprise.

Out of a population of 8.5 mil
lion, about 125,000 are non-Afri
can—European, Asian, and Arab
—but their importance to the
economy is out of proportion to
their numbers. The remarkable
thing about Tanganyika’s sudden
evolution to independence is that
it has been achieved with little
racial friction. To the contrary,
cries against “white and Asian
imperialism” have been held to a
minimum and emphasis has been
on incorporating minority groups
as an integral part of nation. A
series of steps since 1955 has led
to the election by a common roll
in 1960 of a predominantly Afri
can Legislative Council with a
guaranteed minority of non-Afri
can seats. All candidates must ap
peal for their support to an elec
torate made up of all races.

TANGANYIKA’S QUICK pace
to independence is due mainly to
the agitation of its one party, the
Tanganyika African National Un
ion, and more especially to its out
standing leader, now Prime Minis
ter, Julius Nyerere. His modera
tion and insistance on the protec
tion of minority rights have won
him international respect and ad
miration.

A test of the firmness of Nyer
ere’s convictions came earlier this
fall when he presented to the
Legislative Council a White Paper
on citizenship. The bill called for
the granting of citizenship to any
person of Tanganyikan parentage,
any British subject who by virtue
of his residence qualifications
chooses to become a Tankanyikan
citizen, and any other person will
ing to renounce dual citizenship.
To counteract the ruffle of op
position expressed by the more
militant African members of Leg
co. Mr. Nyerere took a personal
stand on the passage of this bill,
vowing to resign his government

if it were not passed and remind
ing the assembly of the value of
minority groups to the develop
ment of Tanganyika. Now enacted
in law, citizenship is based on
national loyalty rather than racial
consciousness.
TANGANYIKA IS also favored
by a lack of disruptive tribalism.
This has been attributed to the
policy of direct rule exercised by
the Germans during their admin
istration. A more crucial factor
is that all but a minority of tribes
are Bantu and thus have racial
and cultural similarities. In ad
dition, Swahili has been establish
ed as a genuine “lingua franca,”
thus facilitating communication
on a national basis. As none of the
tribes are large enough to domi
nate the country, and Mr. Nyerere
himself comes from one of the
smallest tribes, fear of one-tribe
rule has not taken root as it has
in neighboring Kenya.
Tanganyika takes great pride in
its nationalism based on racial
hai’mony and unity. Her experi
ment of basing the nation upon
the foundations of a multiracial
society is worth watching, partic
ularly in the light of the racial
and tribal animosities rampant in
each of her neighbors, Kenya,

Uganda, Zanzibar, Northern Rho
desia, and Nyasaland. Each is a
potential partner in an East Afri
can Federation, for which Nyer
ere is the leading advocate. If
Tanganyika succeeds, her exam
ple and her leadership in the fed
eration movement will have signi
ficant bearing on the future of
the rest of East Africa.

Dec. 9 marked the emergence of
Tanganyika as the first independ
ent territory in British East Afri
ca. Initially a German possession,
Tanganyika was mandated to
Britain in 1920 and transferred to
trusteeship in 1945. Since World
War 11, Tanganyika has under
gone rapid political and economic
changes. Her sisal and coffee ex
ports bring in $56 million a year.
The success of the co-operative
coffee farming by the Chagga on
Mt. Kilimanjaro is a landmark in
the development of purely Afri
can enterprise.

Out of a population of 8.5 mil
lion, about 125,000 are non-Afri
can—European, Asian, and Arab
—but their importance to the
economy is out of proportion to
their numbers. The remarkable
thing about Tanganyika’s sudden
evolution to independence is that
it has been achieved with little
racial friction. To the contrary,
cries against “white and Asian
imperialism” have been held to a
minimum and emphasis has been
on incorporating minority groups
as an integral part of nation. A
series of steps since 1955 has led
to the election by a common roll
in 1960 of a predominantly Afri
can Legislative Council with a
guaranteed minority of non-Afri
can seats. All candidates must ap
peal for their support to an elec
torate made up of all races.

TANGANYIKA’S QUICK pace
to independence is due mainly to
the agitation of its one party, the
Tanganyika African National Un
ion, and more especially to its out
standing leader, now Prime Minis
ter, Julius Nyerere. His modera
tion and insistance on the protec
tion of minority rights have won
him international respect and ad
miration.

A test of the firmness of Nyer
ere’s convictions came earlier this
fall when he presented to the
Legislative Council a White Paper
on citizenship. The bill called for
the granting of citizenship to any
person of Tanganyikan parentage,
any British subject who by virtue
of his residence qualifications
chooses to become a Tankanyikan
citizen, and any other person will
ing to renounce dual citizenship.
To counteract the ruffle of op
position expressed by the more
militant African members of Leg
co. Mr. Nyerere took a personal
stand on the passage of this bill,
vowing to resign his government

if it were not passed and remind
ing the assembly of the value of
minority groups to the develop
ment of Tanganyika. Now enacted
in law, citizenship is based on
national loyalty rather than racial
consciousness.
TANGANYIKA IS also favored
by a lack of disruptive tribalism.
This has been attributed to the
policy of direct rule exercised by
the Germans during their admin
istration. A more crucial factor
is that all but a minority of tribes
are Bantu and thus have racial
and cultural similarities. In ad
dition, Swahili has been establish
ed as a genuine “lingua franca,”
thus facilitating communication
on a national basis. As none of the
tribes are large enough to domi
nate the country, and Mr. Nyerere
himself comes from one of the
smallest tribes, fear of one-tribe
rule has not taken root as it has
in neighboring Kenya.
Tanganyika takes great pride in
its nationalism based on racial
hai’mony and unity. Her experi
ment of basing the nation upon
the foundations of a multiracial
society is worth watching, partic
ularly in the light of the racial
and tribal animosities rampant in
each of her neighbors, Kenya,

Uganda, Zanzibar, Northern Rho
desia, and Nyasaland. Each is a
potential partner in an East Afri
can Federation, for which Nyer
ere is the leading advocate. If
Tanganyika succeeds, her exam
ple and her leadership in the fed
eration movement will have signi
ficant bearing on the future of
the rest of East Africa.

Dec. 9 marked the emergence of
Tanganyika as the first independ
ent territory in British East Afri
ca. Initially a German possession,
Tanganyika was mandated to
Britain in 1920 and transferred to
trusteeship in 1945. Since World
War 11, Tanganyika has under
gone rapid political and economic
changes. Her sisal and coffee ex
ports bring in $56 million a year.
The success of the co-operative
coffee farming by the Chagga on
Mt. Kilimanjaro is a landmark in
the development of purely Afri
can enterprise.

Out of a population of 8.5 mil
lion, about 125,000 are non-Afri
can—European, Asian, and Arab
—but their importance to the
economy is out of proportion to
their numbers. The remarkable
thing about Tanganyika’s sudden
evolution to independence is that
it has been achieved with little
racial friction. To the contrary,
cries against “white and Asian
imperialism” have been held to a
minimum and emphasis has been
on incorporating minority groups
as an integral part of nation. A
series of steps since 1955 has led
to the election by a common roll
in 1960 of a predominantly Afri
can Legislative Council with a
guaranteed minority of non-Afri
can seats. All candidates must ap
peal for their support to an elec
torate made up of all races.

TANGANYIKA’S QUICK pace
to independence is due mainly to
the agitation of its one party, the
Tanganyika African National Un
ion, and more especially to its out
standing leader, now Prime Minis
ter, Julius Nyerere. His modera
tion and insistance on the protec
tion of minority rights have won
him international respect and ad
miration.

A test of the firmness of Nyer
ere’s convictions came earlier this
fall when he presented to the
Legislative Council a White Paper
on citizenship. The bill called for
the granting of citizenship to any
person of Tanganyikan parentage,
any British subject who by virtue
of his residence qualifications
chooses to become a Tankanyikan
citizen, and any other person will
ing to renounce dual citizenship.
To counteract the ruffle of op
position expressed by the more
militant African members of Leg
co. Mr. Nyerere took a personal
stand on the passage of this bill,
vowing to resign his government

if it were not passed and remind
ing the assembly of the value of
minority groups to the develop
ment of Tanganyika. Now enacted
in law, citizenship is based on
national loyalty rather than racial
consciousness.
TANGANYIKA IS also favored
by a lack of disruptive tribalism.
This has been attributed to the
policy of direct rule exercised by
the Germans during their admin
istration. A more crucial factor
is that all but a minority of tribes
are Bantu and thus have racial
and cultural similarities. In ad
dition, Swahili has been establish
ed as a genuine “lingua franca,”
thus facilitating communication
on a national basis. As none of the
tribes are large enough to domi
nate the country, and Mr. Nyerere
himself comes from one of the
smallest tribes, fear of one-tribe
rule has not taken root as it has
in neighboring Kenya.
Tanganyika takes great pride in
its nationalism based on racial
hai’mony and unity. Her experi
ment of basing the nation upon
the foundations of a multiracial
society is worth watching, partic
ularly in the light of the racial
and tribal animosities rampant in
each of her neighbors, Kenya,

Uganda, Zanzibar, Northern Rho
desia, and Nyasaland. Each is a
potential partner in an East Afri
can Federation, for which Nyer
ere is the leading advocate. If
Tanganyika succeeds, her exam
ple and her leadership in the fed
eration movement will have signi
ficant bearing on the future of
the rest of East Africa.
