LIMA PALATABLE?
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial of January 9,
stated: “We urge a student group
to choose a speaker—Lima or
Mandel or any other opponent of
Schwarz’s warped views and
bring him to campus.’’
From the Editor’s reference to
Schwarz’s "warped views,” is one
to assume that the ideology of
Mickey Lima (leader of the
Northern California Communist
Party) seems less warped, less
pernicious, and more palatable to
the Editor than Fred Schwarz’s
opposition to the Communist ide
ology?
To each his own, I suppose.
