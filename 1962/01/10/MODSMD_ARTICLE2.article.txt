# Speech Depicts Loveless Moon

### WILLIAM REPPY 
Our familiar yellow moon was
stripped of his glamor and ro
mance last night in a lecture on
astrogeology by Dr. Eugene Shoe
maker of the U.S. Geological Sur
vey, Menlo Park.
Shoemaker’s talk, “Exploration
of the Surface of the Moon,”
kicked off the winter quarter
Tuesday evening series before a
near full house in Dinkelspiel.
His speech was pure science, high
ly technical and well illustrated
with slides.

SHOEMAKER began with a
description of the moon. Among
many surprising facts: the
moon’s surface is stratified—at
least four layers have been dis
covered: the surface is rough and
powdery; a continual spray of
dust escapes from the moon and
bombards the earth. Chunks of
moon dislodged by the impact of
meteors also strike the earth.

The first major step in explora
tion, Shoemaker continued, will
be lunar mapping from television
pictures. Then vehicles will be
landed to take samples; satellites
will orbit the moon continuing to
make photos.
LUNAR exploration may un
veil clues to life on other planets,
Shoemaker said. The proof may
be found in materials deposited
on the moon in meteorites. Such
material on the moon remains in
tact as there is no rain or wind to
obliterate it.

The sagacious man made of
bleu cheese, always a favorite of
young lovers, may never seem the
same to Shoemaker’s audience.
They’ll see the moon as a poten
tial fueling station for space
flights. This will be one of its
major' uses if water' reserves are
discovered by remote controlled
vehicles sent out from manned
bases sometime in the future,
Shoemaker said.
