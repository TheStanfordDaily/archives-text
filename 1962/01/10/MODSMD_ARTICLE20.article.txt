# Red Hot Card Cagers Host Cal Friday Night
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
The days at the University of
California of Darrell Imlioff, Bill
McCllntock and NCAA champion
ships are past. The basketball for
tunes of the Golden Bears have
gone into deep hibernation, and
although Cal managed to stay
out of the Big 5 cellar last year,
thanks to Stanford, they may not
he so lucky again.
The Cal hoopsters who will en
ter the Pavilion Friday night to
do battle with the soaring Stan
fordites are an inexperienced lot,
shellshocked after two lop-sided
losses at the hands of USC. There
are a whole handful of players
who have shown flashes of prom
ise, but the team has not yet jelled
into a consistent, cohesive unit.
TIIK MAN TO watch in the Cal
lineup is a hot-shoting, hustling
sophomore guard from San Fran
cisco named Denny Lewis. Lewis
has just crashed the starting line
up and his most impressive statis
tic is a 4G per cent field goal aver
age, best on the team. Ih' is also
a good ballhandler and the sort of
spark-plug who could ignite the
Bear team.
Junior forward Don Lauer has
been the most consistently high
scorer in recent action. Although
his average for the season is only
9 points per game, Lauer tossed
in 20 against Washington State

and 22 against Michigan State.
The junior is also second high
among rebounders and second in
field goal accuracy with a 43.8
percentage.
OXIO FACTOR working to the
advantage of the Bears will be
(he return to action of senior for
ward and center Ed Donahue, a
muscular 6-6. Donahue was ex
pected to he Cal’s top man, hut
had to sit out the entire month of
December with pneumonia. He
returned to action Saturday night
against Southern Cal, scoring 15
points and hauling down 8 re
bounds. It was primarily Dona
hue’s play which pulled the Bears
to within shouting distance of
USC before two regulars were
fouled out and doomed their
hopes.
Cal’s leading scorer is Dick
Smith, 6-foot sophomore guard
who has averaged 11.5 points per
game. Smith started the season
with a rush and has tailed off
slightly; however he is still per
haps the most classy player on
the team.
Regular center for most of the
season has been Chris Carpenter,
the squad’s leading rebounder.
Carpenter has not yet shown the
ability to score, sporting a 6.5
point average, and he is also

prone to foul out.
Two forwards who have blown
hot and cold are Jim Smith and
sophomore Bill Wilson. Smith
potted 19 points against Michigan
State but on the season has a
wretched 22,6 per cent field goal
average. Wilson dumped in 20
the night before against Michi
gan. but averages only 4.2 per
game.
Guard Denis Vollom may show
up in the starting lineup, as his
play so far has been consistent if
not distinguished. His chief claim
to fame is the fact that he’s the
only man on the team to miss
more than half of his free throws.
Coach Rene Herrerias is faced
with a problem in trying to find a
winning combination among this
green assortment. The Bears
seemed to jell in the Far West
Classic against Michigan and
Michigan State, trouncing the two
Big Ten schools 76-67 and 85-72
respectively. Also, anybody can
be excused for losing to Southern
Cal, because the Trojans are
loaded this year. Thus, the Bears
just might pull a surprise.

On the other hand, the two
Michigan schools are definitely
the weakest in the Big Ten this
year, and the losses in Los Ange
les were quite decisive.

up and his most impressive statis
tic is a 4G per cent field goal aver
age, best on the team. Ih' is also
a good ballhandler and the sort of
spark-plug who could ignite the
Bear team.
Junior forward Don Lauer has
been the most consistently high
scorer in recent action. Although
his average for the season is only
9 points per game, Lauer tossed
in 20 against Washington State

and 22 against Michigan State.
The junior is also second high
among rebounders and second in
field goal accuracy with a 43.8
percentage.
OXIO FACTOR working to the
advantage of the Bears will be
(he return to action of senior for
ward and center Ed Donahue, a
muscular 6-6. Donahue was ex
pected to he Cal’s top man, hut
had to sit out the entire month of
December with pneumonia. He
returned to action Saturday night
against Southern Cal, scoring 15
points and hauling down 8 re
bounds. It was primarily Dona
hue’s play which pulled the Bears
to within shouting distance of
USC before two regulars were
fouled out and doomed their
hopes.
Cal’s leading scorer is Dick
Smith, 6-foot sophomore guard
who has averaged 11.5 points per
game. Smith started the season
with a rush and has tailed off
slightly; however he is still per
haps the most classy player on
the team.
Regular center for most of the
season has been Chris Carpenter,
the squad’s leading rebounder.
Carpenter has not yet shown the
ability to score, sporting a 6.5
point average, and he is also

prone to foul out.
Two forwards who have blown
hot and cold are Jim Smith and
sophomore Bill Wilson. Smith
potted 19 points against Michigan
State but on the season has a
wretched 22,6 per cent field goal
average. Wilson dumped in 20
the night before against Michi
gan. but averages only 4.2 per
game.
Guard Denis Vollom may show
up in the starting lineup, as his
play so far has been consistent if
not distinguished. His chief claim
to fame is the fact that he’s the
only man on the team to miss
more than half of his free throws.
Coach Rene Herrerias is faced
with a problem in trying to find a
winning combination among this
green assortment. The Bears
seemed to jell in the Far West
Classic against Michigan and
Michigan State, trouncing the two
Big Ten schools 76-67 and 85-72
respectively. Also, anybody can
be excused for losing to Southern
Cal, because the Trojans are
loaded this year. Thus, the Bears
just might pull a surprise.

On the other hand, the two
Michigan schools are definitely
the weakest in the Big Ten this
year, and the losses in Los Ange
les were quite decisive.

points and hauling down 8 re
bounds. It was primarily Dona
hue’s play which pulled the Bears
to within shouting distance of
USC before two regulars were
fouled out and doomed their
hopes.
Cal’s leading scorer is Dick
Smith, 6-foot sophomore guard
who has averaged 11.5 points per
game. Smith started the season
with a rush and has tailed off
slightly; however he is still per
haps the most classy player on
the team.
Regular center for most of the
season has been Chris Carpenter,
the squad’s leading rebounder.
Carpenter has not yet shown the
ability to score, sporting a 6.5
point average, and he is also

prone to foul out.
Two forwards who have blown
hot and cold are Jim Smith and
sophomore Bill Wilson. Smith
potted 19 points against Michigan
State but on the season has a
wretched 22,6 per cent field goal
average. Wilson dumped in 20
the night before against Michi
gan. but averages only 4.2 per
game.
Guard Denis Vollom may show
up in the starting lineup, as his
play so far has been consistent if
not distinguished. His chief claim
to fame is the fact that he’s the
only man on the team to miss
more than half of his free throws.
Coach Rene Herrerias is faced
with a problem in trying to find a
winning combination among this
green assortment. The Bears
seemed to jell in the Far West
Classic against Michigan and
Michigan State, trouncing the two
Big Ten schools 76-67 and 85-72
respectively. Also, anybody can
be excused for losing to Southern
Cal, because the Trojans are
loaded this year. Thus, the Bears
just might pull a surprise.

On the other hand, the two
Michigan schools are definitely
the weakest in the Big Ten this
year, and the losses in Los Ange
les were quite decisive.
