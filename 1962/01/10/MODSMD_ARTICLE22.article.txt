By United Press International
NEW YORK—Roger Maris of
the Yankees, who belted 61 home
runs last season, is likely to be
“belted” himself later this month.
Rog is the leading candidate for
the annual “Professional Athlete
of the Year” award—a $10,000
gem-encrusted Hickok belt.
The belt is a thing of beauty,
studded with diamonds and an
chored by a solid gold buckle. It’s
not very practical for street wear
but as the most costly award in
any sport it’s highly prized both
for the wdnner’s private showcase
and for the eventual social secu
rity involved.
MARIS, WARREN Spahn of
the Braves, Paul Hornung of the
Green Bay Packers, Whitey Ford
of the Yankees and PGA Golf
champ Jerry Barber figure to
lead the balloting now underway
but Maris is favored to be the
winner when the results are post
ed at Rochester, N.Y., Jan. 22.
Five of the previous 11 awards
have gone to baseball players.
Three were fighters, two were
golfers and one a pro footballer,
Otto Graham, surprise winner in
1955.
But as the year-end reviewers
pointed out, Maris was the glamor
boy of the big parade with his as
sault on Babe Ruth’s home run
record of 60 set in 1027.
THE FACT THAT he hit only
59 within the 154-game frame-,
work (ft Ruth’s record clodded
only slightly his new mark of 61
set over 162 games.
Spahn not only pitched a no
hitter and entered the 300-victory
club but led the National League
in earned runs and, with 21 vic
tories, made it his 12th season at
20 or more triumphs—a major
league record for left-handers.
Hornung, dividing his time be
tween the U.S. Army and the
Packers, was a key man in Green
Bay’s ascendancy to the National
Football League championship,
scoring 19 points in the rout of
the Giants in the title game.
FORI) WON 2.5 games for the
Yankees fluring the regular sea
son, plus two in the World Series
against the Reds, shattering
Ruth’s world series of consecutive
shutout innings in the process.
Barber, 45 years old, won the
PGA crown.
But it looks as if the belter,
Maris, will get the belt.
