By United Press International
MIAMI BEACH The' National
Football League, realizing it was
fortunate to escape the tidal wave
of 40 grid deaths which struck
college and high school football
last season, yesterday outlawed
face mask tackles.
Making its first rule change in
four years, the NFL admitted it
“hadn't had the problems” of
colleges and high schols but said
that it felt “preventive action was
necessary.”

THE NEW RULE, submitted by
the Baltimore Colls, orders that

“no player shall grasp the face
mask of an opponent. Penalty 15
yards. Flagrant offenders shall he
disqualified.”
"It has been against the rule to
grab face masks in blocking, but
you could grab the mask of a ball
carrier,” explained Commissioner
Pete Ro/.ell at the annual meeting
where owners huddled over pos
sible trades but consummated no
deals. “But the ball carrier actu
ally is the most defenseless of all
and this new rule cotdd prevent
possible serious injury.’
Rozelle said the pros felt strong
ly that the current plastic head
gear with suspension, under fire
in college and high school ranks
as a lethal weapon, was com
pletely satisfactory. However, he
said, a committee would consult
with equipment manufacturers

concerning possible improve
ments.
