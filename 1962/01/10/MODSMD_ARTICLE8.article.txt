# Limelighters Tickets Sell
## 
### 
Tickets for the Limelight
ers performance at Memorial
Auditorium Feb. 19 will go on
sale next Monday at 11 a.m.
at the Mem Aud Box Office.

Prices are $4, $3 and S2 for
the evening performance. The
show, according to the folk
singers’ manager, will be a
duplicate of the one they gave
Dec. 1 to a sold-out Mem Aud
audience. Thus, those who
couldn’t see the first show
will be able to see it this time.
