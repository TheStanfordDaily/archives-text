## 
### 
Three Stanford professors and
fifteen volunteers from Stern Hall
were among the four hundred
men fighting yesterday and last
night to control a forest fire
which is sweeping the Big Basin
area of the Santa Cruz Mountains.

Tho fire started Sunday and has
since spread to over 3000 acres of
redwood and Douglas Fir, includ
ing Gazos Tree Farm in which
Professors Paul Hanna, William
Odell and Isaac Quillen of the
Stanford education department
own property.

High winds sent sparks flying
from the original site of the fire
so that it is now blazing in throe
separate areas.

Prof. Hanna reported that
about 50 acres of Stanford prop
erty are involved, located 6 miles
in from the coast, halfway be
tween Half Moon Bay and Santa
Cruz. He said that the main con
cern of tho firefighters has been
to keep the blaze from destroying
the valuable State Park forests
nearby.
The fire is believed to have
started from a “controlled burn,”
intended to clear dangerously dry
areas of brush.
