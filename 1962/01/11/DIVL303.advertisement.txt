MIAMI BEACH (UPI) The
National Football League yester
day signed a $9,300,000 two-year
contract with CBS-TV for home
television of each club’s road
games, which almost doubled the
circuit’s annual video income.
The telecasts, which also will be
beamed into Canada through CBS
TV, will net each club approxi
mately $3211,000 annually. This is
enough to guarantee that every
team will wind up in the black.
