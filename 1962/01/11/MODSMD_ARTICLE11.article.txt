# Farm Should View New HUAC Movie
## 
### 
Last winter the pleasant drowsiness of the Stanford campus
was disrupted for a few hours by the showing of the film “Opera
tion Abolition,” which its maker (the House Committee on Un-
American Activities) presents as the “true” story of the student
demonstrations in San Francisco against the HUAC in May of 1960.
Cubberley Auditorium was filled to overflowing twice in one
night as students viewed the movie and heard a panel debate the
merits of the film and the demonstrations. For once, Stanford
students displayed a true interest in something.
Many felt that the film was a distortion while others just as
definitely believed it presented the facts of what happened during
the three days of lIUAC hearings in The City. Rut at least one
side—the Committee’s—was presented on the screen.
Now the other side—which in our opinion is the side closer to
the truth—has come up with a film of its own.
This one is called “Operation Correction” and is billed by the
American Civil Liberties Union, which is distributing it, as “a
film that refutes ‘Operation Abolition.’ ” They offer to rent it for
$l5 plus shipping charges to any group interested in presenting it.
The sponsoring of the showing of this new film by a student
group at Stanford would, it seems to us, be a worthwhile effort. It
would give the other side its say, would allow those who saw
“Operation Abolition” to compare the two opposing views and
would perhaps stir up a little controversy in a year which has
been—even for Stanford—a dull one.

The senior class sponsored the showing of “Operation Aboli
tion.” Why couldn’t this year’s senior class tear itself away from
Happy Hours and present “Operation Correction” at Stanford?
Money is certainly no problem, for if the senior class doesn’t have
$l5 we are sure it could be found somewhere on our money
minded campus.
If the senior class isn’t interested, Political Union or one of its
caucuses could do it. A group of students will show the new film
off-campus tomorrow night, but certainly there must be some
group or class which would be interested in sponsoring a showing
on campus of “Operation Correction.”
The film can be ordered from The American Civil Liberties
Union, 503 Market Street, San Francisco 5.

on campus of “Operation Correction.”
The film can be ordered from The American Civil Liberties
Union, 503 Market Street, San Francisco 5.
Last winter the pleasant drowsiness of the Stanford campus
was disrupted for a few hours by the showing of the film “Opera
tion Abolition,” which its maker (the House Committee on Un-
American Activities) presents as the “true” story of the student
demonstrations in San Francisco against the HUAC in May of 1960.
Cubberley Auditorium was filled to overflowing twice in one
night as students viewed the movie and heard a panel debate the
merits of the film and the demonstrations. For once, Stanford
students displayed a true interest in something.
Many felt that the film was a distortion while others just as
definitely believed it presented the facts of what happened during
the three days of lIUAC hearings in The City. Rut at least one
side—the Committee’s—was presented on the screen.
Now the other side—which in our opinion is the side closer to
the truth—has come up with a film of its own.
This one is called “Operation Correction” and is billed by the
American Civil Liberties Union, which is distributing it, as “a
film that refutes ‘Operation Abolition.’ ” They offer to rent it for
$l5 plus shipping charges to any group interested in presenting it.
The sponsoring of the showing of this new film by a student
group at Stanford would, it seems to us, be a worthwhile effort. It
would give the other side its say, would allow those who saw
“Operation Abolition” to compare the two opposing views and
would perhaps stir up a little controversy in a year which has
been—even for Stanford—a dull one.

The senior class sponsored the showing of “Operation Aboli
tion.” Why couldn’t this year’s senior class tear itself away from
Happy Hours and present “Operation Correction” at Stanford?
Money is certainly no problem, for if the senior class doesn’t have
$l5 we are sure it could be found somewhere on our money
minded campus.
If the senior class isn’t interested, Political Union or one of its
caucuses could do it. A group of students will show the new film
off-campus tomorrow night, but certainly there must be some
group or class which would be interested in sponsoring a showing
on campus of “Operation Correction.”
