## Opposition in the UN 
### 
When the United Nations was
formed some 16 years ago, no one,
I think, foresaw how it would
evolve. Its primary business, it
was then believed, would be to
keep the peace among the victors
of the Second World War. It was
to do this by continual concilia
tion, for each of the great powers
had a veto and therefore force
could not be used against them.
As we now know, the U.N. has not
been able to deal directly with the
great world conflict between the
West and the East, and the task
of preventing another great war
and of maintaining a measure of
co-existence has been carried on
outside the U.N. by direct diplo
macy.

A very different task, which no
one foresaw and planned, has fal
len to the U.N. It is to preside
over the troubles which arise
from the death agony of the old
empires and the birth pains of the
successor states. Without realiz
ing its full significance, the
United States took the lead in in
ducing the U.N. to carry out a
large constitutional reform. The
power to enforce peace was trans
ferred from the Security Council,
where each of the great powers
has a veto, to the General Assem
bly, where each state—be it Ye
men or Great Britain, has one
vote. This change in the constitu
tion of the U.N. was put through
in 1950 during the Truman admin
istration in order to circumvent
the Soviet veto in the Security
Council. At the time our friends
in Western Europe and Latin
America had a secure majority in
the General Assembly.
ALL OF THIS happened before
the world began to see the conse
quences of the break-up of the
British, French, Dutch, Belgian,
Portuguese and Spanish empires
in Asia and Africa. The successor
states have been coming rapidly
into the General Assembly, each
of them with a vote equal to that
of its former overlord. The old
Western majority is drowned, and
the U.N. has become a sounding
board and the pressure instru
ment to complete the liquidation
of the old empires. Behind the
bloc of the successor states, when
ever they wish to call on it for

help, stands the power of the Sovi
et Union.
There is much doubt and anxi
ety in this country about what
our position in the U.N. should
be. It is not easy to define it ac
curately and realistically. But if
it is to be done at all, we cannot
let the problem be misrepresent
ed. It is not true, for example, as
some loose talkers are saying,
that the United States has abdi
cated its sovereignty and has
turned over the conduct of our
foreign policy to a majority of
the General Assembly.
Our true role, so it sems to me,
is to use our power and influence
to preserve and assist the U.N. as
the bridge between the old society
of the Atlantic Community to
which we belong and the new so
cieties which are coming into be
ing elsewhere. This is a hard role,
to be the conciliator, for the hu
man animal is much more ready
to believe that he who is not an
ally is an enemy.
BUT THAT, NEVERTHELESS,
is the role that the United States
has to play. For what is the alter
native? There is none. To ignore
the U.N. with its tumultuous Gen
eral Assembly, to abstain grand
ly from its work, and in fact to
resign from it? That may seem a
wise policy in Paris. But from
Washington it looks like inviting
the great mass of the emerging
states to regard the Soviet Union
as their only true friend.
The U.N. today has 104 mem
bers. I am told by those who have
reason to know such things that
there are 25 or 30 more states
which will achieve national inde
pendence and will then have to be
admitted. An Assembly of 130
governments will be an awe-in
spiring spectacle. It will also be a
terrifying and an almost impossi
ble institution to work with.
The friends of the U.N. will
have to put their minds to work
on the problem of how this multi
tude of governments can be saved
from becoming an excited and
explosive mob. It is a huge prob
lem, and a solution is rapidly be
coming urgent.
