# Hickenlooper Wins GOP Senate Policy Leadership
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPI) Son.
Bourke B. Hickenlooper, lowa,
won the Senate Republican policy
chairmanship yesterday in a 21-
14 vote victory over Sen. Leverett
Saltonstall, Mass. The result
showed that conservatives still
hold the balance of minority pow
er in the Senate.

The 65-year-old Hickenlooper
succeeded the late Sen. Styles
Bridges of New Hampshire in the
influential policy post. Bridges
died last November.

Hickenlooper’s first act as
chairman was to call a policy
meeting to discuss party plans
and an upcoming House-Senate
GOP declaration of principles.
BACKERS OF Saltonstall em
phasized that his candidacy was
pressed in the face of a probable
defeat in order to deny ultra*,
conservatives a victory claim. He
remains on the GOP leadership
team as conference chairman.
The outcome was close to the
20-14 lineup of three years ago
when liberal Republicans chal
lenged the election of floor leader
Everett M. Dirksen, 111., with Sen.
John S. Cooper, Ky., as their can
didate.
"If we had not taken Salton-
Stall’s candidacy to a vote,” said
one liberal backer of the New’
Englander, "the Goldwater people
would have been claiming every
thing in sight.”
HIS REFERENCE WAS to
right-wing supporters of Sen.
Barry Goldwater, Ariz., who is
current chairman of the Senate
Republican Campaign Committee.
But Goldwater said he would
have been "very pleased with
either one” as policy chief.
The new policy chairman told

reporters he was "complimented
by the election” and appreciated
the “fine courtesy” displayed by
Saltonstall, who presided over the
closed-door election session. Sal
lonstall moved to make the elec
tion unanimous after he lost the
secret ballot.
BOTH SALTONSTALL and

Hickonlooper are regarded as
moderates, with the lowan gener
ally viewed as the more conserva
tive.
Hickenlooper was nominated
for the policy post by Sen. Jack
Miller, his lowa colleague. Salton
still was nominated by Sen. Hugh
Scott, Pa.
