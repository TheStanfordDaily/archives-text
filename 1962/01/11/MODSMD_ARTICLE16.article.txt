# our man on the Farm

I have always hecn too bravo for my own good, and this doubtful
quality leads rne tn make a brash prediction. Stanford's basketball
team will be the best on the Farm in the past decade, and possibly the
best since Stanford won the NCAA championship in 1942, and will
finish no worse than second in the Big Five.
You like that? I’ll be even braver. The Indians could take it all,
with a little bit o’ luck.
Howie Dallmar, the M.V.P. the year Stanford won the NCAA
playoffs 20 years ago, will field the tallest team in many a moon, and
possibly the tallest in Stanford history. John Windsor and Tom Dose
both measure in at about 6-8, and (he other front-liner, either Hollis
Moore, 6-4, or Phil Kelly, 6-3, can rebound like a taller man.
Even guard Darrell Sutherland is a tall 6-3*2. Don Clemetson
is the midget of the starting five at 6-1.
All these can shoot. Dose hits at a 40% clip, and Moore has been
making a fantastic 50% of his shots. Windsor has been in a slump,

but those who saw him play last
year remember the 20- and 25-foot
jumpers he made consistently.
Sutherland and Don Clemetson
can hit the long jump shot. The
third guard, Doug Clemetson, is
no scoring slacker either. Kelly
is deadly from the corner, and re
serve center Mike Ledgerwood
has polished a wicked hook shot.
Stanford’s control of the of
fensive backboards is a sight to
behold. A missed shot means a
tip attempt for any of the (all
Tribe near the bucket. Thus the
Indians are less afraid to take a
long shot, and with the talented
distance bombers on the Farm,
this is good.
But perhaps Stanford’s greatest
asset on the basketball court isn’t
shooting, height, or rebounding.
It is depth. Stanford has bench
talent unmatched by any other
team in the Big Five. Forwards
Bob Sommers, Bill Elfving, Tim

Bryan, and either Moore and Kelly, assure Dallmar that a fresh
player is ready at any time to enter the game in place of a tired
regular.
The reserve guards are no less strong. Doug Clemetson, Fred
Pegelow, Lew Shupe. John Fontius and Chris Babbs provide substi
tute backcourt power.
Center Mike Ledgerwood is a valuable replacement for Dose.
He provides stronger defense, equal rebounding ability, and has been
known to put in a clutch basket. Those around Stanford last year
remember his 15-foot jump shot that sank Utah and Billy “the Hill.”
S.C. Favored
The favorite to win the 1961 Big Five basketball crown is USC,
and rightly so. The incumbent champs retain every starter from last
year’s club, and even keep their top reserve.
Center John “Reckless Rudo, the Mad Russian” Rudometkin,
received All-American support last year after a fabulous junior year
at the Figeroa Street sports machine, but observers have called guard
Chris Appel the real key to Trajan success. The ball-hawking Appel
can drive for the layin or pop in a long jumper.
Rudometkin is known as a cutie. He has so many moves around
the basket that he never has to do the same thing twice.
Forwards Ken Stanley and Gordie Martin, and jump-shooting
guard Neil Edwards complete a strong contender for the National
Championship. Forward Vern Ashby provides the reserve strength,
UCLA upset the Washington applecart last weekend by sweeping
a pair from the powerful Huskies. The Bruins were figured for no
better than a fourth-place berth, but the perennially strong West
woodians rebounded from the loss of all-coast forward Ron Lawson
(he was involved in the basketball fixing scandals) and present a
formidable club, in one of the strongest leagues in the nation.
Forwards Pete Blackman and John Cunningham are well-known
for their soft-touch jump shots. Guard Johnny Green is the leading
Bruin scorer, with his ability to draw fouls. Walt Hazzard, a junior
college transfer, complements Green perfectly.
The Bruin trouble spot is center, where Dave Waxman, good
defensively but a null in the scoring column, and Fred Slaughter
hold forth.
Hanson Twice All-Coast
Washington boasts one of the strongest front lines on the West
Coast. Center Bill Hanson has been all-coast two years running and
figures to repeat. Forwards Ed Corell and Roger Niva are top re
bounders, and Corel! has developed a running jump shot that gave
Stanford fits last year. It was a Corell layin of a deflected pass that
edged Stanford in overtime last year.
Guards Dick Reiten and Lyle Bakken don’t score much, but.they
are tenacious defenders.
California is the league’s weak sister for the first time within
memory. Junior guard Dick Smith figures as the only set starter in
a confused mass of sophomores and juniors, with a few seniors
thrown in.
Smith has a jump shot from the perimeter of the key that is
hard to stop. Other Bears sure to see action are guards Denny Lewis
and Denis Vollum, 6-8 centers Chris Carpenter and Bob Wueste, and
forwards Don Lauer, Ed Donahue, Jim Smith and Bill Wilson.
Still, the Bears are tough, as witness their second half comeback
against USC Saturday that had them within six points until Car
penter and Lauer fouled out with 15 minutes left. That left the 6-6
Donahue to guard Rudometkin, and SC pulled out to win going away.
Overall the West Coast teams are at their strongest in years, and
Stanford is one of the best. Cross your fingers and maybe the Indians
can squeak through.

hold forth.
Hanson Twice All-Coast
Washington boasts one of the strongest front lines on the West
Coast. Center Bill Hanson has been all-coast two years running and
figures to repeat. Forwards Ed Corell and Roger Niva are top re
bounders, and Corel! has developed a running jump shot that gave
Stanford fits last year. It was a Corell layin of a deflected pass that
edged Stanford in overtime last year.
Guards Dick Reiten and Lyle Bakken don’t score much, but.they
are tenacious defenders.
California is the league’s weak sister for the first time within
memory. Junior guard Dick Smith figures as the only set starter in
a confused mass of sophomores and juniors, with a few seniors
thrown in.
Smith has a jump shot from the perimeter of the key that is
hard to stop. Other Bears sure to see action are guards Denny Lewis
and Denis Vollum, 6-8 centers Chris Carpenter and Bob Wueste, and
forwards Don Lauer, Ed Donahue, Jim Smith and Bill Wilson.
Still, the Bears are tough, as witness their second half comeback
against USC Saturday that had them within six points until Car
penter and Lauer fouled out with 15 minutes left. That left the 6-6
Donahue to guard Rudometkin, and SC pulled out to win going away.
Overall the West Coast teams are at their strongest in years, and
Stanford is one of the best. Cross your fingers and maybe the Indians
can squeak through.

I have always hecn too bravo for my own good, and this doubtful
quality leads rne tn make a brash prediction. Stanford's basketball
team will be the best on the Farm in the past decade, and possibly the
best since Stanford won the NCAA championship in 1942, and will
finish no worse than second in the Big Five.
You like that? I’ll be even braver. The Indians could take it all,
with a little bit o’ luck.
Howie Dallmar, the M.V.P. the year Stanford won the NCAA
playoffs 20 years ago, will field the tallest team in many a moon, and
possibly the tallest in Stanford history. John Windsor and Tom Dose
both measure in at about 6-8, and (he other front-liner, either Hollis
Moore, 6-4, or Phil Kelly, 6-3, can rebound like a taller man.
Even guard Darrell Sutherland is a tall 6-3*2. Don Clemetson
is the midget of the starting five at 6-1.
All these can shoot. Dose hits at a 40% clip, and Moore has been
making a fantastic 50% of his shots. Windsor has been in a slump,

but those who saw him play last
year remember the 20- and 25-foot
jumpers he made consistently.
Sutherland and Don Clemetson
can hit the long jump shot. The
third guard, Doug Clemetson, is
no scoring slacker either. Kelly
is deadly from the corner, and re
serve center Mike Ledgerwood
has polished a wicked hook shot.
Stanford’s control of the of
fensive backboards is a sight to
behold. A missed shot means a
tip attempt for any of the (all
Tribe near the bucket. Thus the
Indians are less afraid to take a
long shot, and with the talented
distance bombers on the Farm,
this is good.
But perhaps Stanford’s greatest
asset on the basketball court isn’t
shooting, height, or rebounding.
It is depth. Stanford has bench
talent unmatched by any other
team in the Big Five. Forwards
Bob Sommers, Bill Elfving, Tim

Bryan, and either Moore and Kelly, assure Dallmar that a fresh
player is ready at any time to enter the game in place of a tired
regular.
The reserve guards are no less strong. Doug Clemetson, Fred
Pegelow, Lew Shupe. John Fontius and Chris Babbs provide substi
tute backcourt power.
Center Mike Ledgerwood is a valuable replacement for Dose.
He provides stronger defense, equal rebounding ability, and has been
known to put in a clutch basket. Those around Stanford last year
remember his 15-foot jump shot that sank Utah and Billy “the Hill.”
S.C. Favored
The favorite to win the 1961 Big Five basketball crown is USC,
and rightly so. The incumbent champs retain every starter from last
year’s club, and even keep their top reserve.
Center John “Reckless Rudo, the Mad Russian” Rudometkin,
received All-American support last year after a fabulous junior year
at the Figeroa Street sports machine, but observers have called guard
Chris Appel the real key to Trajan success. The ball-hawking Appel
can drive for the layin or pop in a long jumper.
Rudometkin is known as a cutie. He has so many moves around
the basket that he never has to do the same thing twice.
Forwards Ken Stanley and Gordie Martin, and jump-shooting
guard Neil Edwards complete a strong contender for the National
Championship. Forward Vern Ashby provides the reserve strength,
UCLA upset the Washington applecart last weekend by sweeping
a pair from the powerful Huskies. The Bruins were figured for no
better than a fourth-place berth, but the perennially strong West
woodians rebounded from the loss of all-coast forward Ron Lawson
(he was involved in the basketball fixing scandals) and present a
formidable club, in one of the strongest leagues in the nation.
Forwards Pete Blackman and John Cunningham are well-known
for their soft-touch jump shots. Guard Johnny Green is the leading
Bruin scorer, with his ability to draw fouls. Walt Hazzard, a junior
college transfer, complements Green perfectly.
The Bruin trouble spot is center, where Dave Waxman, good

The favorite to win the 1961 Big Five basketball crown is USC,
and rightly so. The incumbent champs retain every starter from last
year’s club, and even keep their top reserve.
Center John “Reckless Rudo, the Mad Russian” Rudometkin,
received All-American support last year after a fabulous junior year
at the Figeroa Street sports machine, but observers have called guard
Chris Appel the real key to Trajan success. The ball-hawking Appel
can drive for the layin or pop in a long jumper.
Rudometkin is known as a cutie. He has so many moves around
the basket that he never has to do the same thing twice.
Forwards Ken Stanley and Gordie Martin, and jump-shooting
guard Neil Edwards complete a strong contender for the National
Championship. Forward Vern Ashby provides the reserve strength,
UCLA upset the Washington applecart last weekend by sweeping
a pair from the powerful Huskies. The Bruins were figured for no
better than a fourth-place berth, but the perennially strong West
woodians rebounded from the loss of all-coast forward Ron Lawson
(he was involved in the basketball fixing scandals) and present a
formidable club, in one of the strongest leagues in the nation.
Forwards Pete Blackman and John Cunningham are well-known
for their soft-touch jump shots. Guard Johnny Green is the leading
Bruin scorer, with his ability to draw fouls. Walt Hazzard, a junior
college transfer, complements Green perfectly.
The Bruin trouble spot is center, where Dave Waxman, good
defensively but a null in the scoring column, and Fred Slaughter
hold forth.
Hanson Twice All-Coast
Washington boasts one of the strongest front lines on the West
Coast. Center Bill Hanson has been all-coast two years running and
figures to repeat. Forwards Ed Corell and Roger Niva are top re
bounders, and Corel! has developed a running jump shot that gave
Stanford fits last year. It was a Corell layin of a deflected pass that
edged Stanford in overtime last year.
Guards Dick Reiten and Lyle Bakken don’t score much, but.they
are tenacious defenders.
California is the league’s weak sister for the first time within
memory. Junior guard Dick Smith figures as the only set starter in
a confused mass of sophomores and juniors, with a few seniors
thrown in.
Smith has a jump shot from the perimeter of the key that is
hard to stop. Other Bears sure to see action are guards Denny Lewis
and Denis Vollum, 6-8 centers Chris Carpenter and Bob Wueste, and
forwards Don Lauer, Ed Donahue, Jim Smith and Bill Wilson.
Still, the Bears are tough, as witness their second half comeback
against USC Saturday that had them within six points until Car
penter and Lauer fouled out with 15 minutes left. That left the 6-6
Donahue to guard Rudometkin, and SC pulled out to win going away.
Overall the West Coast teams are at their strongest in years, and
Stanford is one of the best. Cross your fingers and maybe the Indians
can squeak through.

I have always hecn too bravo for my own good, and this doubtful
quality leads rne tn make a brash prediction. Stanford's basketball
team will be the best on the Farm in the past decade, and possibly the
best since Stanford won the NCAA championship in 1942, and will
finish no worse than second in the Big Five.
You like that? I’ll be even braver. The Indians could take it all,
with a little bit o’ luck.
Howie Dallmar, the M.V.P. the year Stanford won the NCAA
playoffs 20 years ago, will field the tallest team in many a moon, and
possibly the tallest in Stanford history. John Windsor and Tom Dose
both measure in at about 6-8, and (he other front-liner, either Hollis
Moore, 6-4, or Phil Kelly, 6-3, can rebound like a taller man.
Even guard Darrell Sutherland is a tall 6-3*2. Don Clemetson
is the midget of the starting five at 6-1.
All these can shoot. Dose hits at a 40% clip, and Moore has been
making a fantastic 50% of his shots. Windsor has been in a slump,

but those who saw him play last
year remember the 20- and 25-foot
jumpers he made consistently.
Sutherland and Don Clemetson
can hit the long jump shot. The
third guard, Doug Clemetson, is
no scoring slacker either. Kelly
is deadly from the corner, and re
serve center Mike Ledgerwood
has polished a wicked hook shot.
Stanford’s control of the of
fensive backboards is a sight to
behold. A missed shot means a
tip attempt for any of the (all
Tribe near the bucket. Thus the
Indians are less afraid to take a
long shot, and with the talented
distance bombers on the Farm,
this is good.
But perhaps Stanford’s greatest
asset on the basketball court isn’t
shooting, height, or rebounding.
It is depth. Stanford has bench
talent unmatched by any other
team in the Big Five. Forwards
Bob Sommers, Bill Elfving, Tim

Bryan, and either Moore and Kelly, assure Dallmar that a fresh
player is ready at any time to enter the game in place of a tired
regular.
The reserve guards are no less strong. Doug Clemetson, Fred
Pegelow, Lew Shupe. John Fontius and Chris Babbs provide substi
tute backcourt power.
Center Mike Ledgerwood is a valuable replacement for Dose.
He provides stronger defense, equal rebounding ability, and has been
known to put in a clutch basket. Those around Stanford last year
remember his 15-foot jump shot that sank Utah and Billy “the Hill.”
