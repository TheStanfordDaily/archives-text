# AFL Gives Foss Vote of Confidence; Wismer Satisfied
## 
### 
SAN DIEGO (UPD—The an
nual American Football League
meeting ended here yesterday on
notes of optimism, and an ex
pressed desire to work together
to keep alive its contest with the
National Football League for fan
approval.
Shortly after midnight Wednes
day, the owners tore up Commis
sioner Joe Foss’s three-year con
tract which still had another year
to run and gave him a new five
year pact, and $5,000 per year
raise.

Foss said the move indicated
the owners felt he had done a
good job and showed their confi
dence in the league.
“When the league gives me a
contract it’s a no-cut contract,”
he said. Confidence in the Oak
land franchise was also demon
strated when Oakland’s co-owner
Wayne Valley was elected presi
dent of the league.
The expected clash between

Foss and New York Titan owner
Harry Wismer failed to develop,
at least openly. At a news con
ference Tuesday night Wismer

said he was satisfied with Foss’
work and that the feud between
the two had been blown out of
proportion. As an indication of his
feelings, Wismer voted for Foss’
new contract.

Several rule changes were

passed. The most important was
raising the player limit during
the season to 36 from 33. Valley
said another session is scheduled
for later in the year to discuss
raising the limit higher depend
ing on the effect of the military
draft.

Another rule change was to
make the stadium clock the of
ficial time piece. Official time had
been kept by the umpire on the
field.

The face guard rule was also
changed early yesterday after
being rejected Tuesday. This rule
would make it a defensive holding
penalty against a player who
tackled a man by grabbing his
face guard.

Rules for the training camp
period were also revised. Camps
will commence eight weeks before
the start of the season this year
instead of seven, and the player
limit for training sessions will be
60 instead of 65.

Further decisions regarding the
league’s future hinged on the anti
trust suit against the National
Football League. The suit is
scheduled to be heard in the U.S.
district court in Baltimore, Md.,
beginning Feb. 19. The AFL is
asking, among other things. $lO
million damages and the ejection
of the National League Dallas
Cowboys from Dallas.

sioner Joe Foss’s three-year con
tract which still had another year
to run and gave him a new five
year pact, and $5,000 per year
raise.

Foss said the move indicated
the owners felt he had done a
good job and showed their confi
dence in the league.
“When the league gives me a
contract it’s a no-cut contract,”
he said. Confidence in the Oak
land franchise was also demon
strated when Oakland’s co-owner
Wayne Valley was elected presi
dent of the league.
The expected clash between

Foss and New York Titan owner
Harry Wismer failed to develop,
at least openly. At a news con
ference Tuesday night Wismer

said he was satisfied with Foss’
work and that the feud between
the two had been blown out of
proportion. As an indication of his
feelings, Wismer voted for Foss’
new contract.

Several rule changes were

passed. The most important was
raising the player limit during
the season to 36 from 33. Valley
said another session is scheduled
for later in the year to discuss
raising the limit higher depend
ing on the effect of the military
draft.

Another rule change was to
make the stadium clock the of
ficial time piece. Official time had
been kept by the umpire on the
field.

The face guard rule was also
changed early yesterday after
being rejected Tuesday. This rule
would make it a defensive holding
penalty against a player who
tackled a man by grabbing his
face guard.

Rules for the training camp
period were also revised. Camps
will commence eight weeks before
the start of the season this year
instead of seven, and the player
limit for training sessions will be
60 instead of 65.

Further decisions regarding the
league’s future hinged on the anti
trust suit against the National
Football League. The suit is
scheduled to be heard in the U.S.
district court in Baltimore, Md.,
beginning Feb. 19. The AFL is
asking, among other things. $lO
million damages and the ejection
of the National League Dallas
Cowboys from Dallas.
SAN DIEGO (UPD—The an

meeting ended here yesterday on
notes of optimism, and an ex

to keep alive its contest with the
