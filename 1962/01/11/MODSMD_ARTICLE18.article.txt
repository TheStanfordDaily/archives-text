# HOT CARDS FACE CAL
## Sophs, Old Men Set To Crush Bears Friday 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
In all the hub-bub over the new
comers to Stanford’s cage squad,
Card roofers have tended to over
look some of (he regulars from
last year’s squad who are quietly
turning in first-rate perform
ances.

There’s no doubt about the fact
that Tom Dose is good, and Farm
partisans may wish that he could
play all the time, but the fact is
that a fellow gets tired running
up and down that court. When
Dose goes out he’s replaced by
Mike Ledgorwood, and the friend
ly 6-7 giant does a more than re
spectable job.
I.EDGEKVVOOD was the first
string center last year, and while
his offensive moves were less
than sensational, on defense and
the backboards he excelled. This
year, with ever-increasing experi
ence and confidence, Mike’s of
fensive play is smoother too.
Forward and co-captain Phil
Kelly may not see much action
this week, due to a virus, but as
the “sixth man” he is invaluable.
A midget by today’s standards at
6-3, Kelly is fourth high in team
rebounds, despite the fact that he
is not among current starters.
John Windsor, scoring and re
bounding leader on last year’s
squad, has surrendered the spot
light to Dose, but is rebounding
at a 25 Vr higher rate than before
and maintaining a respectable
shooting percentage.
BACKCOURT ACE Don Clem
etson, the only sophomore to
crash the lineup in 1960-1961, is

now the offensive director of the
Indian attack. In the home games
to date Clemetson has racked up
23 assists, mostly to the big cen
ter with (he soft touch, and is
therefore responsible for many of
the headlines.

It is the blending of these ex
perienced oldsters with the sensa
tional sophs which promises a
victory against the hated Bears
tomorrow night.

Ledgerwood was a starting center last year and this cage season
is proving to be the best reserve center in the Big Five.
