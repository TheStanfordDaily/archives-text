## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPD- Presi
dent Kennedy will ask Congress
for authority to slash tariffs by
50 per cent and eliminate duties
on some specific items, Sen.
George A. Smathers, D-Fla. said
yesterday.
Smathers, a member of the
Senate Finance Committee which
handles tariff legislation, said
the Presidentâ€™s liberal trade bill
will include some proposals for
assistance to industries which
would be hurt by the lower tar
iffs. But he said there will be no
mention of direct subsidies.
The Florida senator, who at
tended two leadership meetings
with the President this week, said
the White House has not yet put
the finishing touches on the trade
proposals.
Smathers said the first section
of the bill will call for authority
to make the 50 per cent tariff
cuts. Another section of the bill
will ask authority to eliminate en
tirely the tariffs on specific items,
he said.
Still another section. Smathers
said, will propose assistance to
injured industries which would
take the I form of government
help for relocation, job retrain
ing and education, and a greater
concentration of government con
tracts.
