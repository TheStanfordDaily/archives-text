### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
first of two articles on the ST&T
seminar conducted by Charles R.
Beye last night.)

“Stanford shouldn’t abolish fra
ternities. or put them into clus
ters either. It should base them
around a powerful faculty ‘mas
ter’ who has a say in ‘dinging,’ in
giving a final recommendation
needed for graduation, and has a
largo entertainment fund.” So
stated Dr. Charles R. Beye of the
Classics Department in an ST&T
seminar with the Zetes and the
women of Florence Moore’s Loro
House last night.
Beye, in answering a series of
questions he termed “so loaded
that one can’t be perfectly frank;
the vitriol would pour out all
over the floor and consume the
house,” found one of Stanford’s
main problems in the area of resi
dences.

“THERE is no place to talk at
Stanford; no discussion takes
place on this campus. I can’t talk
to my students, only at them.
There should be coffee shops all
over the campus. There should

be a coffee shop in every dorm.
The Cellar is wormy and abom
inable; I don’t know what Tres
idder will be like, but I can’t talk
in a bowling alley—can you?”
“I would give anything to get
into one of those residence com
mittees. At Yale, at Harvard, con
certs, plays, etc. in dorms are
happening all the lime. Nothing
like that happens hero.”
Beye queried the Zetes; “When
was the last time you put on a
play or had a faculty tea?” The
response was negative.

“STANFORD is working to the
limit of its intellectual and finan
cial abilities; it’s attempting huge
and ambitious programs.”
In answering, “Do the winds of
freedom really blow at Stan
ford?” Beye asserted that the
Stanford administration was
“good and liberal,” but “plays it
safe” in campus political activi
ties.

“Where the winds of freedom
don’t blow at Stanford is where
the students don’t put any breath
into them. Harvard and Yale pa
pers review professor’s speeches
and criticize nastily. Harvard’s
paper ran a violent objection to
the English department’s ap
proach to the teaching of “Moby
Dick.”

“THE STANFORD Daily has
no more raison d’etre than a piece
of toilet paper. It prints only the
cheapest, shortest precis that arc
written much better in the Chron
icle.- ’

Answering the unavoidable,
“What can we do?’’ Beye raised
a voice for student action: “Stan
ford students should approach
the teaching on this campus in an
immediate and expensive way.
Harvard students put out on un
dergraduate guide to classes with
intelligent knocks and praises
which every faculty member gets
hold of as soon as it is off the
press.”
“If faculty members had more
time to teach—and less pressure
t« publish—and if students aired
their views, there would be an
effect.” This was in answer to a
query on administrative concern
with teaching quality.
“This is the second greatest
University in the United States;
some day it may be the greatest.
There is no reason we shouldn’t
have the arrogance of the first
greatest, the arrogance that
makes the Cambridge man in the
street beat his head against the
College’s brick walls, and enables
the faculty to lean out the window
and spit at them.”

CLASSICS PROFESSOR Charles R. Beye seninars with the Zetes and Loro in one of last night's ST & T
sessions which covered all campus gripes and potential thoroughly.
(EDITOR’S NOTE: This is the
first of two articles on the ST&T
seminar conducted by Charles R.
Beye last night.)

“Stanford shouldn’t abolish fra
ternities. or put them into clus
ters either. It should base them
around a powerful faculty ‘mas
ter’ who has a say in ‘dinging,’ in
giving a final recommendation
needed for graduation, and has a
largo entertainment fund.” So
stated Dr. Charles R. Beye of the
Classics Department in an ST&T
seminar with the Zetes and the
women of Florence Moore’s Loro
House last night.
Beye, in answering a series of
questions he termed “so loaded
that one can’t be perfectly frank;
the vitriol would pour out all
over the floor and consume the
house,” found one of Stanford’s
main problems in the area of resi
dences.

“THERE is no place to talk at
Stanford; no discussion takes
place on this campus. I can’t talk
to my students, only at them.
There should be coffee shops all
over the campus. There should

be a coffee shop in every dorm.
The Cellar is wormy and abom
inable; I don’t know what Tres
idder will be like, but I can’t talk
in a bowling alley—can you?”
“I would give anything to get
into one of those residence com
mittees. At Yale, at Harvard, con
certs, plays, etc. in dorms are
happening all the lime. Nothing
like that happens hero.”
Beye queried the Zetes; “When
was the last time you put on a
play or had a faculty tea?” The
response was negative.

“STANFORD is working to the
limit of its intellectual and finan
cial abilities; it’s attempting huge
and ambitious programs.”
In answering, “Do the winds of
freedom really blow at Stan
ford?” Beye asserted that the
Stanford administration was
“good and liberal,” but “plays it
safe” in campus political activi
ties.

“Where the winds of freedom
don’t blow at Stanford is where
the students don’t put any breath
into them. Harvard and Yale pa
