# Szilard Invites Students to Help Abolish War
## 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
“War seems indeed to be in
evitable. unless it is possible
somehow to alter the pattern of
behavior which America and Rus
sia are exhibiting at present,” Dr.
Leo Szilard, one of the atomic
bomb’s principal developers and
now a leading campaigner for sci
entists to join in abolishing war,
told an audience which crowded
Cubberley Auditorium last night.

Stanford radio station KZSII,
880 on the dial, will broadcast, a
taped recording of Szilard's
speech at 4 p.m. Friday.

The formation of a Council for
Abolishing War under the direc
torship of 12 distinguished scien
tists is the method which Szilard
proposes to alter this pattern of
behavior and open the door to a
constructive effort to end war.
“I CAME HERE to invite you
to participate in an experiment
that ought to show whether such
a movement could be successfully
launched,” the University of Chi
cago biophysics professor told his
audience.
THE FIRST STEP of the coun
cil would be to formulate its two
sets of objectives. Szilard out
lined five immediate political ob
jectives on which a dedicated mi
nority could perhaps unite.”
These are:
• THE PRESIDENT should
issue an executive order against
fighting meaningless battles in
the Cold War.
• New personnel should han
dle the East-West cultural ex
change program and prevent the
imposition of senseless travel re
strictions on visiling Russian sci

enlists.
• America should retain her
striking force for protection, not
as a deterrent.
• America must keep the atom
ic bombs in Europe under her
own control and not relinquish
control to NATO.
• Non-government discussions
among Americans and Russians
should be started to reach agree
ment on how peace may be se
cured in a disarmed world.
STANFORD IS one of eight
university communities at which
this experiment is to bo based.
Szilard asked that students who
heard his speech first deside if
they want to participate in such
a movement, ask others within
the university community wheth
er they might wish to participate,
and write to him in about four to
six weeks listing the people who
want to participate. He stated that
the probability of success should
be known within two months.
The professor stated that the
Lobby would hold regular hear
ings. Members would be expected
to support actively at least one
of its several specific objectives
and write letters to public policy
makers such as editors and con
gressmen. They would be regard
ed as pledged annually to spend
two per cent of their income on
political contributions.

TIIK 3IOVKMKNT could help
intelligent men in Congress to
have “the courage of their con
victions” and help replace men in
capable of insight with better
men.

Other universities which Dr.
Szilard spoke at and which he has
asked to participate in this ex
periment include Harvard, Ber
keley and Reed,
