# Sterling Reviews Stanford's Growth, Future of Grads
## 
### FRANCES FISHER Contributing Editor 
What are the chances a Stan
ford student will become a ditch
digger? “Pretty slim,” said
President Wallace Sterling as part
of his “State of the University”
address yesterday at Memorial
Auditorium.
IN CONTRAST, the chances a
Stanford student will go to gradu
ate school are extremely high,
with a whopping 46 per cent of
the Stanford Class of ’6l having
been accepted into graduate
schools. Only 10 per cent of the
’6l class planned “never to go to
graduate school” according to the
National Opinion Research Study
which Sterling quoted. The fig
ures from the study are based on
questionnaires returned by 363
students of the Class of '6l.

Sterling attributed the high
percentage partly to the fact that
both undergraduate and graduate
work is done here. He mentioned
that most students across the na
tion desiring to do graduate work
come from schools which combine
graduate and undergraduate edu
cation.

“Stanford’s rate of growth is
close to the top, if not at the top,
of the major institutions of high
er learning of the nation,” Ster
ling stated. He supported the
statement with facts from a fi
nancial review of the past 10

years—described as “a very at
tractive document.”

ALTHOUGH tuition has nearly
doubled in ten years, total expen
ditures have quadrupled, rising
from an annual $10,740,000 to
$44,470,000. Total gifts to Stan
ford have risen even more dra
matically—from $3 million in 1951
to $23 l ii million in 1961. The Uni
versity’s endowment has grown
from almost $4B million to $159
million. Both money for research
projects and money for student
financial aid have increased near
ly eight-fold.
Sterling reported the PACE
program is on schedule with one
third of the $lOO million goal
($34 million) having been raised
in approximately one-third of the
five-year money-raising period.
A COMMITTEE to review un
dergraduate education has been
formed, Sterling reported, men
tioning several areas which will
receive special attention. He ex
pects:
• Inspection of the role of res
idence halls with improvements
made in both program and physi
cal facilities
• An assault on one- and two
unit courses
• Enthusiasm for courses
given in sequence
• Greater opportunity for hon
ors and tutorial work
• Improvement in library fa
cilities, especially when the new
undergraduate library is com
pleted.
STERLING forecast that some
time in the future Stanford will
explore improvements in under
graduate education “experimen
tally” by having 10 to 20 per cent
of the student body take under
graduate curricula different from
the rest of the student body.
“This kind of work needs to be
done in the private sector of high
er education rather than the pub
lic, but the benefits of such an ex
periment could be valuable to
public schools also,” Sterling com
mented.
In the intellectual sphere, Ster
ling expressed anxiety about the
current place of the humanities
in view of modern emphasis on
the sciences. He hopes that “Stan
ford will play an important part
in filling the chasm between the
humanities and the sciences.”
In conclusion Sterling predict
ed continuing stiff competition
for admission to Stanford, com
petition which he hopes will “pro
duce a student body of greatly
varied talents.”

The talk by President Sterling
will be broadcast over KZSU, 880
on the dial, at 5:15 Friday after
noon.
