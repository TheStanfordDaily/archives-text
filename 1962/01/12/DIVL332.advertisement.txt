CHEVY II
NOVA
A top-down picture in Jammu?
Sure! We simply couldn’t wait to
show you the easiest-to-own Chev
rolet Convertible you ever flipped
a lop over! Get a load of that
broad-loop carpeting, the elegant
instrument panel, and the leather
like vinyl on those bucket seats*
up front. Wo call it Fisher Body
finesse. What else will you find?
Plenty of zip, for one thing, from
a spunky 6. Plenty of room, too.
And the ride’s firm, but ever so
gentle, thanks to new Mono-Plate
rear springs. Go see how inexpen
sively your Chevrolet dealer can
put some June in your January
with Chevy II!
Chevy II teas -put to the tent
