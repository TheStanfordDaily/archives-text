# Vast ASSU Survey On; Reform Afoot
## 
### 
A sweeping survey of Stanford student government and the role
and influence of students in University affairs is underway by a spe
cial ASSU committee. Set up by ASSU President Bob Sayler, the
committee is undertaking what is probably the most serious and
far-reaching study of what student government is at present and

what place it should hold in the 4
life of the Farm ever attempted
at Stanford.
A possible revision of the ASSU
Constitution may result when the
committee’s findings are present
ed to Legislature sometime in the
next month.
THE 18-MEMBER group, chair
ed by Delta Tau Delta President
Tob Boysen, contains students
from all areas of the University.
Among specific areas being in
vestigated by subcommittees of
the main group are the judiciary
setup, liaison between the stu
dents and administration and the
role of the Legislature.
Sayler established the commit
tee in the belief that students at
Stanford are not even coming
close to exercising the power they
could and should in student and
University life over all. He feels
both students and University
would benefit from a student gov
erning system which would de
bate things more important than
the Skin Diving Club constitution,
and which could carry the views
of the students to the administra
tion in areas which affect the stu
dent body.
“This committee is an attempt
to find out how to bring the stu
dents into the University,” Sayler
declares. To do this, he advocates
students sitting on various Uni
versity committees to convey an
intelligent, well-thought-out stu
dent view to the different commit
tees which help run the school.
HE ALSO FEELS a strong Leg
islature which is not tied down by
administrative duties and minor
matters is vital to both the stu
dents and the entire University
community.
"Students have a right to de
cide more than the color of Rally
Com sweaters,” he adds.
‘‘Students can and should do
more” than they are now “not
only for their own benefit, but for
fhe benefit of such things as the
Alumni Association—and the en
tire University. Moreover, stu
dents operating at the maximum
of their capacity is, I think, an
exceptionally good educational
theory anyway.” he points out.
He quotes A1 Lowenstein, di
rector of Stern Hall, who has
noted “Our education is what we
all are here for. This is vital to
our education.”

ingful University activities has
evolved. Housing, academic af
fairs, the judicial system and so
and are examples of this new
Interest.
“THE PRESENT STUDENT body
is active and compellingly inter
ested they have biases on these
issues because they are thinking
about them. This is impressive
and should be recognized by the
University for the benefits that
can accrue.”
Thus, a belief that Stanford
students want more to say in the
way their life and the University’s
life goes on and that they de
serve this right for their own sake
and that of Stanford—pi’ompted
Sayler to establish the special
committee.

Several deans and other high
administration officers have ap
peared or are scheduled to appear
before the group as it probes the
direction organized student effort
should take.

MEMBERS OF THE committee
are: Dave Dierdorff, ICC presi
dent; Chris Cottle, football team
co-captain; Lawry Chickering, Po
litical Union president and Zete
president: Joel Meister, HR presi
dent; Sue Goodwillie, Branner
head sponsor; Scotty Thompson,
HR vice president: Linda Gogins,
AVVS president ; Bill Hansen, pres
ident of the Stern houses; Harlan
Robinson; Jerry Putler, Wilbur
head sponsor; Ward McDonald,
graduate representative to
LASSU; Martha Sweeney, ASSU
vice president; John Steinbrun
ner, Wilbur sponsor; Swede Pier
son, IFC president; Judy Sklar,
Daily associate editor; Jerry Ran
kin, Daily editor; Boysen; and
Sayler.

SAYLER HAS GREAT confi
dence in the interest Stanford
students would have in a strong,
active student governing process
in which their views would carry
more weight than they do now in
such matters as housing policy,
academic matters, general educa
tional programs, student financial
aid and so on.

Sayler says it is the responsi
bility of the student governing
system to “provide an atmos
phere conducive to the expression
of student views.”

More student participation in
the University’s business as it
heads into a challenging era is
necessary to offset the “imper
sonal nature the continual growth
of Stanford can create,” he ex
plains.
A student body which is disin
terested in the way the University
is run and how and why decisions
affecting the students are made
will harm both itself and Stan
ford, he says.
“WE STUDENTS CAN and
should make a good many more
decisions for ourselves, and ad
vise the University on more de
cisions.”
Sayler reports he has uncover
ed a “considerable feeling” among
students that they are sometimes
paid scant attention for four
years, then slapped on the back
and sent on their way without
having really affected their own
life at the school and the life of
the university in general. He
doubts that the University has
benefitted from such a program.
Sayler notes that for years stu
dents have been more concerned
with the football schedule and the
student union activities, thus they
were made members of the Board
of Athletic Control and the union
committee.
But, he continues, “There has
fortunately been a profound
change in the last few years and
an interest in much more mean-
