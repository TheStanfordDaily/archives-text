# Varied Hill Reactions to JFK Plans

WASHINGTON (UPD—Presi
dent Kennedy’s State of the Union
Message split Congress along
party lines yesterday. Democrats
called it a “bold, forward” pro
gram but Republicans branded it
a “Sears Roebuck catalogue with
the old prices marked up.”
Republicans were quick to at
tack the President’s request for
standby authority to reduce in
come taxes if necessary to head
off inflation. One GOP lawmaker
said such a step would be uncon
stitutional.
CHAIRMAN Harry F. Byrd (D-
Va.) of the Senate Finance Com
mittee also condemned the Presi
dent’s proposals for standby tax
cutting and public works spend
ing authority as “fundamental vi
olations of the Constitution.”

In delivering his address, Ken
nedy was roundly applauded by
the Democrats when he advanced
his proposal for cutting tariffs.
This plan was met by silence from
the Republican side.

The remark about a “Sears-
Roebuck catalogue” came from
Senate Republican Leader Everett
M. Dirksen. He said the speech
“can hardly be called a great mes
sage nor can it be called a bad
one.”

The Illinois senator said the re
quest for standby tax cutting au
thority “appears as arequest for
Congress to surrender its author
ity in this field and would seem
to be a movement in the direction
of centralized executive power.’
SEX. PAUL H. Douglas, D-111,
a member of the finance commit
tee, said the tax proposals were
sound because a recession might
come along while Congress was
in recess.

“It might be logically desir
able’ to give the President power
to increase taxes as well. Douglas
said, but this could be criticized
♦as a usurpation of legislative
power.

House Republican Loader
Charles A. Halleck, R-Ind., said
he could not be “as glowing in
by appraisal of the State of the
Union as was President Ken
nedy.”

Halleck said the jobless rate
was higher under Kennedy than
it was in 1960 under Eisenhower;
Agricult ui - e Secretary Orville
Freeman’s farm program was a

“failure”; and the administra
lion’s program for aiding depress
ed areas had broken down.
