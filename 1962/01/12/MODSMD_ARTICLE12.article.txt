# Studentd Government Should Be Effective
## 
### 
What may be the most important development in the history of
student government at Stanford is described in the lead story on
page 1 of today’s Daily. The committee set up by ASSU President
Hob Sayler to reorganize the student governing process and to win
for students an influential voice in University affairs is without
question overdue.

Any student—and this includes LASSU members—who is honest
with himself must admit that LASSU and students in general are
not doing the job of using the power they have to influence de
cisions which affect them. Student government itself is a farce,
with a few notable exceptions. One of the more courageous acts
a member of The Daily can perform is to volunteer to cover Legis
lature meetings, which often get so ridiculous that one is tempted
to cry out in frustration at the incredible number of minor, petty
matters that LASSU must pass on. It seems to us as Bob Sayler
points out, that student government could find more important
things to do than to decide the color of Rally Com sweaters or
approve the crew’s pancake breakfast.
It is not the personnel of LASSU which needs revising, how
ever. It is the system. There are a number of proposals up before
the special committee on how to do this. Among them there must
be at least one suggestion which would enable student government
to carry the views of the students to the administration and to
make it an effective, lively method of representing the students
and adding to their education.
Certainly an effective student government would benefit both
the students and the University.
We feel it is an obligation of the committee to come up with a
sound, simple formula for making student government a vital, in
tegral, influential part of Stanford life. A revision of the ASSU
Constitution obviously is necessary, and perhaps a new one should
be written.
Now is the time for action. The interested students are at hand,
an ASSU president who doesn’t hestitate to lead is in office and the
Stanford students certainly would like to see a meaningful student
government which would truly represent them in all phases of
University life.
Before the year is out we expect to see an election at which
Stanford students will choose to approve a reorganized, effective
student government.
