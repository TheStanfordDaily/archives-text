## Sophia Loren Gives 'Superb' Performance in 'Two Women' 
### ALAN ROSENTHAL 
It is interesting to note the two
distinct aproaches used in the pub
licity blurbs for “Two Women,”
currently at The Metro, San Fran
cisco, One blurb, designed for
drive-ins and theatres playing the
English-speaking version, invites
you to see a film where “ . . .
suddenly love becomes lust, and
innocence becomes shame as two
women are trapped by violent
passion.” More modestly the Art
cinemas inform you that it con
tains Sophia Loren “winner of
the best actress award at the
Cannes Festival, 1961.” You can
take your choice.
My preference is for the latter,
because for once the award is jus
tified. As one critic has put it,
Loren roesn’t give a performance,
she gives an existence. She is su
perb, a word I seldom use.
LOREN PLAYS Cesira, a young
widow, who leaves wartime Rome
with her 13-year-old daughter to
seek the safety of her native vil
lage. They reach Ciociara by train
and foot after being brushed by
death from a strafing plane which
kills instead a passing cyclist.
The general peace of the village
is disturbed by local fascist pa
trols, arriving refugees, air raids
and the growing hunger of the
community, whilst the mental
calm of the peasants is continu
ally challenged by an idealist stu
dent (Jean Paul Belmondo) who
falls in love with Cesira.
With the turn in the fortunes of
war the widow turns back to the
safety of Rome after the student
has been taken as guide by some
fleeing Germans, Seeking refuge
for the night in an abandoned
church the mother and daughter
are discovered and raped by a
group of Moroccan soldiers fight
ing on the Allies’ side. This trau
matic experience transforms the
daughter who spends the follow
ing night with a lorry driver in
return for a pair of stockings. Yet
finally something of the bitter
ness is dissolved and the daughter
brought back to life when she
learns of the death of the student.

THE RAPE SCENE is one of
the most emotionally painful I
have seen on the screen, yet the
general feeling of the film is one
of gentleness, kindness and under
standing of humanity. Though
one is confronted with evil one is
also confronted with a spirit that
will rise above it, and in the ulti
mate analysis one remembers the
humour as much as the pain.
The direction of De Sica is gen
nerally good, but somehow the in
terest is too often narrative rather
than cinematic. In spite of this
there are some memorable screen
moments: the stillness of the
road as the cyclist lays silent in
death; the departing Allies and
villagers seen through the mist;
and the classic moment as mother
and daughter regain conscious
ness after the rape.
I don’t know Moravia’s novel
hut suspect that it probably delves
deeper than Zavattini’s script.
Conflicts are suggested between
the anti-W'ar idealist student, the
fascists, and their simple uncom
prehending fellow travelers, yet
the arguments are left in the air.
There is an illusion of commit
ment, but no definition. Zavattini
is more successful in his humour,
and one is treated to a glorious
discussion among the peasant
women as to the merits of Musso
lini as a bed fellow.
LOREN'S ACTING, and the
feeling that the film deals with
real people instead of stock types
makes the picture worth seeing.
However I would recommend a
trip to San Francisco if only to
see the accompanying Academy
Award-winning cartoon.
“Munro Goes to War” is based
on a noted cartoon of Jules Feif
fer. It is human, original and fun
ny, and tells of the tribulations
of a four-year-old who receives an
Army draft order.
I repeat it is funny. I can’t re
member the last time I was genu
inely amused by a cartoon, and
have often thought that the sub
ject of sadism in cartoons would
prove an admirable thesis topic.
Can anyone oppose this conten
tion?
