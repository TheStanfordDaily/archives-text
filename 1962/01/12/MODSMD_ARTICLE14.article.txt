PICKET WELCH
Editor, The Daily:
As you may or may not be
aware, Robert Welch is presently
staying at the Mark Hopkins Ho
tel in San Francisco. We would
like to take this opportunity to ex
tend to you and your friends an
invitation to join us in picketing
him there, this Saturday, Jan. 13
We do not protest his right to
speak, but only what he says; we
feel that his broad, wholesale de
nunciations of those with whom
he disagrees as Communists; that
his secret, hierarchial John Birch
Society which devotes itself to
campaigns of slander, and calum
ny; that his attempts to curtail
all freedom of speech, press and
thought: and that his attempts to
set himself and his followers up
as self-made judges and juries is
not only un-American, but con
flicts with every human value and
with the most basic human need:
freedom of conscience.
We would therefore like to in
vite all those who agree with us
to a mass picketing of Robert
Welch Saturday, from 10 a.m. on.
Further information can be ob
tained by calling either Barbara
Stevens or Judy Levin in the Un
ion Residence, DA 3-9043.

his secret, hierarchial John Birch
Society which devotes itself to
campaigns of slander, and calum
ny; that his attempts to curtail
all freedom of speech, press and
thought: and that his attempts to
set himself and his followers up
as self-made judges and juries is
not only un-American, but con
flicts with every human value and
with the most basic human need:
freedom of conscience.
We would therefore like to in
vite all those who agree with us
to a mass picketing of Robert
Welch Saturday, from 10 a.m. on.
Further information can be ob
tained by calling either Barbara
Stevens or Judy Levin in the Un
