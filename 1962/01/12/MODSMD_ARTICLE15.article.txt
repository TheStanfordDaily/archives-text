BERLIN “2150,000 Packages
Daily into the Eastern Zone and
East Berlin.” “Over Twice as
Many as Last Year.”
These headlines appeared in
many West German newspapers
between Christmas and New
Years, and they had an unmistak
able double meaning. If one reads
between lines, they serve not only
as a compliment to the private in

itialive of the West German popu
lation, but also describe precisely
the conditions under which 17
million citizens of Walter Ul
bricht’s puppet state spent the
holiday season.

It was a Christmas of need and
fear, of brutality and drabness.
Yuletide began early in December
with an overall strengthening of
the infamous wall in Berlin. The
party newspaper, Noues Deutsch
land, explained these measures
with the cynical words: “to in
sure a Merry Christmas for all
the children.”

TEACHERS AT the grade
school level, however, who sang
Christmas carols with their pu
pils were promptly arrested; and
the only songs to be heard in
public gatherings were those
about workers’ heroes, young
Communist Horwart, and Yuri
Gagarin.

The children learned that Santa
Claus and his elves had died in
the “heroic battle for freedom in
the German Democratic Repub
lic.” Furthermore, one found no
mention of Christmas or Advent
in the East German calendars,
and the entire holiday season was
denounced as an “evil element of
capitalism, no longer appropriate
in the Communistic framework.”

It would be a grave misconcep
tion, however, to believe that a
significant per cent of the East
Germans fell prey to these ridicu
lous and yet vicious party procla
mations.

CHRISTMAS TREES were
found in the homes in East Ber
lin almost as often as in those of
West Berlin. The crucial differ
ence was that they were not dis
played in the windows on the
other side of the wall, but instead
were hidden in a remote corner.
The candles were only lighted
after the shades had been cau
tiously drawn and were blown
out at the first knock on the door.
Any superficial sign of Christmas
was treated as passive resistance
and led to punishment or impris
onment.

Despite Ulbricht's drastic
measures and negative propa
ganda the Christmas season was
also able to assert its basic re
ligious character and the
churches, where the minister or
priest was not yet arrested, were
jammed during the whole of Ad
vent.

MANY ASPECTS of the East
German Christmas of 1961 com
pared unfortunately all too favor
ably with the first cold, drab post
war years. Empty chairs used to
be placed at the dinner table on
Christmas day in remembrance
and hope for those who had not
yet returned from the Siberian
prison camps. Today this custom
has been largely forgotten in
West Germany but remains vivid
ly alive in the “German Democrat
ic Republic.” The remembrance is
now for the thousands of political
prisoners in the overfilled prisons
of the zonal government.
Empty shop windows, long
lines in the streets, and conspicu
ous absence of typical German
yuletide delicacies complete this
hideous picture. Seventeen years
after the war Ulbricht’s planned

economy .still finds it, necessary
to issue ration cards and the ra
tions in almost every category
have become smaller since 1945.

The most welcome present for
a husband was a small box of
cigars, bought one at a time dur
ing the past several months, and
seamless stockings of poor quali
ty or unobtainable medicine
smuggled from West Germany in
sugar boxes and coffee tins re
mained the real luxuries.
A CHRISTMAS FAIR existed
in East Berlin as well as in the
Western sectors, but the atmos
phere was completely different.
The small booths and the rides
were hardly patronized although
the fair grounds were always
well-filled. The people seemed to
be seeking nothing more than a
few minutes of freedom from
their insufferable every day life,
a chance to rub elbows and min
gle with others, without being
forced to give a written declara
tion of faithfulness to the insidi
ous Ulbricht government.
The radio and television offer
ed no special holiday programs,
but merely intensified the hate
campaign against the West, and
more specifically against the
West German government. This
very futility and emptiness how
ever, brought the East Germans
inescapably into the narrow con
fines of their families and seem
ed to awaken the true, often for
gotten, Christmas values. There
was neither place nor possibility
for pomp or conceit and the few
small joys became major events.
Thought and effort supplanted all
material values and glitter.
THE PACKAGES from West
Germany brought unobtainable
goods to the East Germans and
were undoubtedly received with
heartfelt thanks, but the small
bruised apple for which the moth
er stood in line several hours in
the snow and rain certainly
brought immeasurable joy to the
small son or daughter on the
quiet Christmas Eve in East Ber
lin.

fear, of brutality and drabness.
Yuletide began early in December
with an overall strengthening of
the infamous wall in Berlin. The
party newspaper, Noues Deutsch
land, explained these measures
with the cynical words: “to in
sure a Merry Christmas for all
the children.”

TEACHERS AT the grade
school level, however, who sang
Christmas carols with their pu
pils were promptly arrested; and
the only songs to be heard in
public gatherings were those
about workers’ heroes, young
Communist Horwart, and Yuri
Gagarin.

The children learned that Santa
Claus and his elves had died in
the “heroic battle for freedom in
the German Democratic Repub
lic.” Furthermore, one found no
mention of Christmas or Advent
in the East German calendars,
and the entire holiday season was
denounced as an “evil element of
capitalism, no longer appropriate
in the Communistic framework.”

It would be a grave misconcep
tion, however, to believe that a
significant per cent of the East
Germans fell prey to these ridicu
lous and yet vicious party procla
mations.

CHRISTMAS TREES were
found in the homes in East Ber
lin almost as often as in those of
West Berlin. The crucial differ
ence was that they were not dis
played in the windows on the
other side of the wall, but instead
were hidden in a remote corner.
The candles were only lighted
after the shades had been cau
tiously drawn and were blown
out at the first knock on the door.
Any superficial sign of Christmas
was treated as passive resistance
and led to punishment or impris
onment.

Despite Ulbricht's drastic
measures and negative propa
ganda the Christmas season was
also able to assert its basic re
ligious character and the
churches, where the minister or
priest was not yet arrested, were
jammed during the whole of Ad
vent.

MANY ASPECTS of the East
German Christmas of 1961 com
pared unfortunately all too favor
ably with the first cold, drab post
war years. Empty chairs used to
be placed at the dinner table on
Christmas day in remembrance
and hope for those who had not
yet returned from the Siberian
prison camps. Today this custom
has been largely forgotten in
West Germany but remains vivid
ly alive in the “German Democrat
ic Republic.” The remembrance is
now for the thousands of political
prisoners in the overfilled prisons
of the zonal government.
Empty shop windows, long
lines in the streets, and conspicu
ous absence of typical German
yuletide delicacies complete this
hideous picture. Seventeen years
after the war Ulbricht’s planned

economy .still finds it, necessary
to issue ration cards and the ra
tions in almost every category
have become smaller since 1945.

The most welcome present for
a husband was a small box of
cigars, bought one at a time dur
ing the past several months, and
seamless stockings of poor quali
ty or unobtainable medicine
smuggled from West Germany in
sugar boxes and coffee tins re
mained the real luxuries.
A CHRISTMAS FAIR existed
in East Berlin as well as in the
Western sectors, but the atmos
phere was completely different.
The small booths and the rides
were hardly patronized although
the fair grounds were always
well-filled. The people seemed to
be seeking nothing more than a
few minutes of freedom from
their insufferable every day life,
a chance to rub elbows and min
gle with others, without being
forced to give a written declara
tion of faithfulness to the insidi
ous Ulbricht government.
The radio and television offer
ed no special holiday programs,
but merely intensified the hate
campaign against the West, and
more specifically against the
West German government. This
very futility and emptiness how
ever, brought the East Germans
inescapably into the narrow con
fines of their families and seem
ed to awaken the true, often for
gotten, Christmas values. There
was neither place nor possibility
for pomp or conceit and the few
small joys became major events.
Thought and effort supplanted all
material values and glitter.
THE PACKAGES from West
Germany brought unobtainable
goods to the East Germans and
were undoubtedly received with
heartfelt thanks, but the small
bruised apple for which the moth
er stood in line several hours in
the snow and rain certainly
brought immeasurable joy to the
small son or daughter on the
quiet Christmas Eve in East Ber
lin.

capitalism, no longer appropriate
in the Communistic framework.”

It would be a grave misconcep
tion, however, to believe that a
significant per cent of the East
Germans fell prey to these ridicu
lous and yet vicious party procla
mations.

CHRISTMAS TREES were
found in the homes in East Ber
lin almost as often as in those of
West Berlin. The crucial differ
ence was that they were not dis
played in the windows on the
other side of the wall, but instead
were hidden in a remote corner.
The candles were only lighted
after the shades had been cau
tiously drawn and were blown
out at the first knock on the door.
Any superficial sign of Christmas
was treated as passive resistance
and led to punishment or impris
onment.

Despite Ulbricht's drastic
measures and negative propa
ganda the Christmas season was
also able to assert its basic re
ligious character and the
churches, where the minister or
priest was not yet arrested, were
jammed during the whole of Ad
vent.

MANY ASPECTS of the East
German Christmas of 1961 com
pared unfortunately all too favor
ably with the first cold, drab post
war years. Empty chairs used to
be placed at the dinner table on
Christmas day in remembrance
and hope for those who had not
yet returned from the Siberian
prison camps. Today this custom
has been largely forgotten in
West Germany but remains vivid
ly alive in the “German Democrat
ic Republic.” The remembrance is
now for the thousands of political
prisoners in the overfilled prisons
of the zonal government.
Empty shop windows, long
lines in the streets, and conspicu
ous absence of typical German
yuletide delicacies complete this
hideous picture. Seventeen years
after the war Ulbricht’s planned

economy .still finds it, necessary
to issue ration cards and the ra
tions in almost every category
have become smaller since 1945.

The most welcome present for
a husband was a small box of
cigars, bought one at a time dur
ing the past several months, and
seamless stockings of poor quali
ty or unobtainable medicine
smuggled from West Germany in
sugar boxes and coffee tins re
mained the real luxuries.
A CHRISTMAS FAIR existed
in East Berlin as well as in the
Western sectors, but the atmos
phere was completely different.
The small booths and the rides
were hardly patronized although
the fair grounds were always
well-filled. The people seemed to
be seeking nothing more than a
few minutes of freedom from
their insufferable every day life,
a chance to rub elbows and min
gle with others, without being
forced to give a written declara
tion of faithfulness to the insidi
ous Ulbricht government.
The radio and television offer
ed no special holiday programs,
but merely intensified the hate
campaign against the West, and
more specifically against the
West German government. This
very futility and emptiness how
ever, brought the East Germans
inescapably into the narrow con
fines of their families and seem
ed to awaken the true, often for
gotten, Christmas values. There
was neither place nor possibility
for pomp or conceit and the few
small joys became major events.
Thought and effort supplanted all
material values and glitter.
THE PACKAGES from West
Germany brought unobtainable
goods to the East Germans and
were undoubtedly received with
heartfelt thanks, but the small
bruised apple for which the moth
er stood in line several hours in
the snow and rain certainly
brought immeasurable joy to the
small son or daughter on the
quiet Christmas Eve in East Ber
lin.

BERLIN “2150,000 Packages
Daily into the Eastern Zone and
East Berlin.” “Over Twice as
Many as Last Year.”
These headlines appeared in
many West German newspapers
between Christmas and New
Years, and they had an unmistak
able double meaning. If one reads
between lines, they serve not only
as a compliment to the private in

itialive of the West German popu
lation, but also describe precisely
the conditions under which 17
million citizens of Walter Ul
bricht’s puppet state spent the
holiday season.

It was a Christmas of need and
fear, of brutality and drabness.
Yuletide began early in December
with an overall strengthening of
the infamous wall in Berlin. The
party newspaper, Noues Deutsch
land, explained these measures
with the cynical words: “to in
sure a Merry Christmas for all
the children.”

TEACHERS AT the grade
school level, however, who sang
Christmas carols with their pu
pils were promptly arrested; and
the only songs to be heard in
public gatherings were those
about workers’ heroes, young
Communist Horwart, and Yuri
Gagarin.

The children learned that Santa
Claus and his elves had died in
the “heroic battle for freedom in
the German Democratic Repub
lic.” Furthermore, one found no
mention of Christmas or Advent
in the East German calendars,
and the entire holiday season was
denounced as an “evil element of
capitalism, no longer appropriate
in the Communistic framework.”
