# Indians Host Bears In Big Five Opener
## 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Sporting a flashy 10-2 season’s
record, the promising but untest
ed Stanford cagers move into con
ference play tonight against Cal.
Although Cal’s hoopsters have
been slightly less than redhot, the
attitude in Coach Howie Dall
mar's camp is nothing more than
guarded optimism.
Indian partisans may be prone
to make brash predictions of
“best ever,” and rival coaches
have gone so far as to compare
the Card center Tom Dose with
a certain Ohio State All-Ameri
can, hut the immediate opponent
is Cal and the Card mentor, like
every coach since time began, is
playing them “one at a time.”
Before rating the Indians in the
national top ten on the basis of
their 21 and 25 point romps
against Oregon last week, it
might be well to remember that
the Ducks were playing without
their biggest and best man, which
probably had a mental effect as
well as the loss of scoring punch.
Another factor which may serve
to temper the exuberance of Card
rooters is the uncertain physical
condition of Co-Captain Phil Kel
ly, an excellent rebounder and one
of the first-line reserves. Kelly
has missed action this week be
cause of a virus, and may not be
able to play.
All this, however, cannot
change the fact that Stanford is
playing Cal tonight at 8 p.m., and
for the first time in the memory
of any current undergraduate the
Cards can rate as solid favorites.
With Hollis Moore and Don
Clemetson feeding the ball to big
Tom Dose, John Windsor and
Dose cleaning off the boards, and
Darrell Sutherland hitting from
the outside, the Indians are scor
ing far more than their usual
quota. At the same time they have
succeeded in holding down the to
tals of their opponents to reason
able levels.
Unless the Stanfordites have
been spending too much time

reading their press clippings this
week it is highly probable that
Dose and company will succeed
in bewildering the inexperienced
Bears, forcing the Cal rooters to
munch on their straw hats.
With the return of Ed Donahue
to the Cal lineup the Bears can
not be taken lightly, and anyone
who saw last year’s game at Ber
keley in which Stanford blew a
half-time lead of better than 20
points knows the dangers of over
confidence against Cal.
With 6-8 Chris Carpenter, Don

Lauer and Donahue on the front
line, the Bears should he able to
rebound along with Stanford.
Denny Lewis and Dick Smith
don’t give away much in the back
court either, but perhaps the
greatest edge the Cards will have
is at center.

In recent years Stanford has
had centers who were either big,
tough rebounders or good shoot
ers, but rarely a combination of
both. Dose has both these attri
butes and a lot of others. The way
college basketbal is played today,
no team can go much further
than its center can carry it. Al
though Dose and Carpenter are
equal in height, Dose excells in all
the other categories.
Doug Clemetson, Mike Ledger
wood, Bob Sommers and Jim Bry
an should be in line for plenty of
action tonight too. They should
outclass the Cal bench of Jim
Smith, Bill Wilson, Denis Vollom
and Bob Wueste, though they all
have shown brilliant flashes.

It all adds up to a promising
evening. Farm fans will get an
other chance to size up the prog
ress of the young Card team and
speculate on how far it will he
able to go. The first step will be
to “Beat Cal.”
