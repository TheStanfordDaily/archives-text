# Frosh Cagers Face Unbeaten Cal Bearcubs
## 
### TOM PARKER 
“This should be the toughest
game of the year,’’ were the words
of frosh basketball coach Bill Tur
ner when he was asked about the
Cal game to be played tonight.
“We will be going into the game
with a 4-0 record and they will be
going into it with a 7-0 record, and
we'll both be really working for a
win.”

This week’s starting line-up will
probably find Jack Gilbert and
Bob Garner at forward, John Mur
ray at center and Dick Ragsdale
and Rod Young in the guard slots.

Mike Preisler, one of Turner’s
real hopefuls, will be returning to
the squad after a layoff due to
illness. “There is a good chance
that Mike will be playing a large
part of the game,” says Turner,
“and that means one of the start
ing five will have to do some sit
ting.”

Just who will do the sitting is
hard to say. Gilbert is the team’s
high scorer and leading rebound
er. His 1.3-point average and his
14 rebounds per game make him
hard to replace.
Garner is a good board man
averaging nine rebounds a game
and according to coach Turner,
“The best defensive man we
have.”

“Murray,” says Turner, “is a
big strong boy with a good shoot
ing eye, and a real good board
man. His scoring hasn’t been as
high as the other members of the
squad, but he hasn’t played in as
many games.

“Ragsdale is a real competitor
who has guarded the toughest op
position guard in the last two
games. He doesn’t shoot too often,
but has an excellent percentage.
He is the team’s best passer.”
Ragsdale is scoring 4.75 points a
game.

Young, who will go into the
game with a 6.75 average, is also
a steady player.
Center Craig Cordes will, and
has. also seen a good deal of ac
tion this year.
Turner mentioned that ho had
seen the Cal team play, and that
Stanford fans should be on the
watch for some excellent play by
the Cal guards and center.
“Guards Dan Wolthers and How
ard Holt are both real fine play
ers, and the center, Mike Hender
son is certainly nothing to be
laughed at either,” says Turner.
“We should, though, be stronger
rebounding in the front line.

Wrapping it up Turner says
that “Cal is supposed to be the
best team in the area, and I really
think we’ll give them a good bat
tle.”
