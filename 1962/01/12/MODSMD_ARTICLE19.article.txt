# TRIBE'S FIRST LEAGUE MATCH
## Ruggers Visit Bears Tomorrow 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford’s rugby team opens Its
1962 schedule tomorrow against
the California Bears in a contest,
at Cal’s Memorial Stadium start
ing at 2 p.m.
Since 1935 Cal and Stanford
have matched strength on 34 oc
casions with the Golden Bears
coming out on top 2S times, how
ever, last season the Card ruggers
split a two-game series but man
aged to outscore the Berkeleyites
to win the Big Scrum Axe.
INSTITUTED last year, the
Big Scrum Axe is awarded annu
ally to the team scoring the most
points during that year’s contests
between the two clubs. Stanford
won the Axe by outpointing the
Bears by a 14-12 margin.
Like the Indian rugbymen, Cal
ifornia’s squad is well bolstered
with footballers looking to keep in
shape during the off season. Nine
of the Bear’s opening lineup of 15
are members of Marv Levy’s grid
squad.
Jim Burress and Rudy Carvajal,
playing at the wing positions, are
the most experienced of the Bear
gridders playing rugby. Other fol
lowers of the pigskin include line
men Larry Lowell, Dave Favro,
Tom Burke and Doug Graham.

PERHAPS the most outstand
ing Boar rugger is Dave Hall, who
holds down the hooker spot for
California. Hall is one of the most
experienced men on the Cal team

and will help to make the Bear
scrum the tough one that it al
ways is.

Hurting the Bears will be the
absence of John Harrison, one of
last year’s standout backs and
Jim Ferguson, the Blue and Gold
kicker, who is out with a concus
sion.
Coach Pete Kmetovic’s Cards
are out to improve on last sea
son’s mark, a mighty tough task,
since the 1961 Tribe shower! a
nearly perfect 13-1 win-loss rec
ord.

THB INDIAN’S job is marie
considerably tougher by the fact
that the Bears play rugby on a
narrower than regulation field
because Memorial Stadium is not
large enough to permit the nor
mal dimensions of a rugby field.
The Cards have been practicing
all week on a special narrow field
in order to get used to the nar
rower turf, but they will still be
at a disadvantage. A narrow field
hampers the Cards’ wide open
style of play and favors the Bears
who like to play most of their
game in the scrum.
Carrying most of the scoring
load for Stanford will be Stan
Lindskog. Lindskog has won the
kicking job, and in rugby most of
the scoring is done via the boot
in the form of conversions and
penalty kicks and an occasional
field goal.
OTHER Tribe starters will he
John Thomas, Troy Barbee, Ran
dy Vahan, Jon Brandin, Dick Lee
uwenhurg, Keith Richmond, Steve
Pursell, John Butler, Bob Price,
Tom McManus, Hal Steuber,
Chuck Cobb, Kurt Hauser and
Rod Sears.

PERHAPS the most outstand
ing Boar rugger is Dave Hall, who
holds down the hooker spot for
California. Hall is one of the most
experienced men on the Cal team

and will help to make the Bear
scrum the tough one that it al
ways is.

Hurting the Bears will be the
absence of John Harrison, one of
last year’s standout backs and
Jim Ferguson, the Blue and Gold
kicker, who is out with a concus
sion.
Coach Pete Kmetovic’s Cards
are out to improve on last sea
son’s mark, a mighty tough task,
since the 1961 Tribe shower! a
nearly perfect 13-1 win-loss rec
ord.

THB INDIAN’S job is marie
considerably tougher by the fact
that the Bears play rugby on a
narrower than regulation field
because Memorial Stadium is not
large enough to permit the nor
mal dimensions of a rugby field.
The Cards have been practicing
all week on a special narrow field
in order to get used to the nar
rower turf, but they will still be
at a disadvantage. A narrow field
hampers the Cards’ wide open
style of play and favors the Bears
who like to play most of their
game in the scrum.
Carrying most of the scoring
load for Stanford will be Stan
Lindskog. Lindskog has won the
kicking job, and in rugby most of
the scoring is done via the boot
in the form of conversions and
penalty kicks and an occasional
field goal.
OTHER Tribe starters will he
John Thomas, Troy Barbee, Ran
