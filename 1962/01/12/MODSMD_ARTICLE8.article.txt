## 
### ILENE H. STRELITZ Staff Editor 
In an ST&T seminar among
Classics Prof. Charles R. Beye,
the Zeta Psi house and Loro wom
en, campus isues were illuminat
ed as reported in yesterday’s
Daily. Due to Prof. Beye’s inter
esting responses to student ques
tions, the report is continued.
“Should Stanford adopt a nu
merical grading system?” Em
phatically, Beye declared, “No!
We should abolish grades com
pletely and have a comprehensive
exam in the major field instead.
“STUDENTS shouldn’t have to
write papers while taking courses.
(“Is the administration consider
ing the semester system?”) The
semester system is always under
consideration. One shouldn’t ex
pect anyone to be able to write a
paper in 10 weeks.
“Students should have plenty of
time to sit around, relax, read,
talk. There should be scholarships
for “all year” so that students
don’t have to work over the sum
mer—they should be able to lie
around in a hammock and think.
“All you have time for is study,
study, study, study until it wears
you to a frazzle—a veritable fraz

“This campus has no place to
just sit around. The only place is
Union Courtyard, which is pleas
ant with the fountain if you can
find a place to sit where the birds
haven’t gotten to.”
BEYE LISTED three areas into
which PACE contributions will be
placed to boost undergraduate
education: an undergraduate li
brary (“for which no one has as
yet donated one penny”); living
quarters; new faculty. He cited
the lack of a “college” within Ihe
University as a Stanford prob
lem in undergraduate education.
“There should be a distinct aura
to Stanford, an environment to
tally different from the one you
left and the one you'll go into.
There should be the solidarity
that a college brings. Do you feel
as if you’re part of something dis
tinct from the Business School or
the Law School?”
“This idea is emphatically de
nied, but 1 think it would be great.
At Harvard you’re not a “Harvard
man” unless you went to Harvard
College. This way at Stanford you
can be a “Stanford man” in the
Law School or Business School.”
“Docs Stanford cater to engi
neering to the expense of the
humanities?”
"Not at all, Stanford just at

tracts money for engineering,
medicine. They intend to lower
the amount these schools get
from the general Stanford fund
as more comes in for them. This
will free money for things in the
other schools that never would
have been possible.”
"Is Stanford considering inte
grated dorms?” “Why can’t wom
en live off campus?”
“Integrated dorms are under
serious consideration. Why should
women spend all their life with
out freedom? Why have hours
when people have to come in? If
they are going to get into trouble,
they will. So what if they can’t
stay on the road, so drunk they
land in a ditch? It’s survival of
the fittest—there isn't room for
everyone.

“Faculty residents at the mo
ment are expected to move into
two little closets—no kitchen—as
of they’re some kind of cook liv
ing in the cellar.”
BEYE LASHED OUT at the
“California attitude,” the “lack of
any conception of decorum”
among Stanford students.
“Are Stanford students treated
as adults?”
“Of course not they’re not
adults. They’re immature, social
ly inept people. The manners of

the students are deplorable. They
don’t know how to treat a profes
sor. They must learn life is an au
thoritarian structure from the
amoeba to God—all have their
place within this.”
“IS THKRE academic suppres
sion at Stanfoi’d?”
“Stanford is a good solid liber
al campus . . . but you can al
ways tell what the speakei’s are
going to say. I would like to
listen to some good solid neo-
Nazis, or Marilyn Monroe, or any
thing new. I can’t imagine any
serious Political Union inviting
politicians to speak; they have
nothing to say.
“This University is quite cour
ageous. It is certainly more libei’al
than Yale. Yale thinks all major
compromises were settled in the
18th centui’y.”
“Does Stanford take money
with lowalty oth stipulations?’
“Yes, they take it, but they de
plore it. Stanford is really a poor
University tiying to do every
thing Harvard is doing.
“At Stanford you always have
the feeling you are at the begin
ning of a fabulously new day in
the history of the University. This
is because the administration is
straining itself to its financial and
intellectual limits.”
