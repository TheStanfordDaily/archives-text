# Kennedy Requests Standby Powers in Tariff, Tax Cutting
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UPl»—Presi
dent Kennedy called on Congress
yesterday to let him cut taxes in
the face of any recession and to
lower tariffs as part of the Free
World’s economic battle against
Communism.

In a State of the Union message
that left Congress split along par
ty lines, the President appealed
for a host of foreign and domes
tic programs ranging from his
controversial medical care and
school plans to U.S. funds for the
United Nations.
WARNING that a cold war ar
mistice “seems very far away,” he
urged approval of a five-year tar
iff-cutting trade program so U.S.
producers can join Europes’ com
mon market manufacturers in “A
trading partnership.” Otherwise,
he said, the United States will be
cut off from its allies amid a
mounting economic offensive by
the Communists.

The President’s message, de
livered in person before a joint
session of the House and Senate,
was hailed by Democrats as a
model of world leadership and
criticized by Republicans as a
catalogue of inflationary and even
unconstitutional programs.
Republicans quickly denounced
one of his major domestic pro
posals—a request for presidential
authority , subject to a congres
sional veto, to lower personal in
come taxes within a specified
range and time when a recession
threatened.
KENNEDY SAID the idea
would be to "slow down an econ
omic decline before it has dragged
us down.” He sought the author
ity now, although the country is
on “the high road” out of the re
cent recession, because “the
time to repair the roof is when
the sun is shining.”
He also sought authority to
speed up such programs as re
clamation, flood control, irriga
tion and construction of urban
water and sewer systems in eco
nomic crises.

The President declared: “Our
nation is commissioned by history
to be an observer of freedom’s
failure or the cause of its suc
cess. Our overriding obligation in
the months ahead is to fulfill the
world’s hope by fulfilling our own
faith.”

HE PARTICUEAKEY sounded
this note in advising Congress
that he would submit a new five
year trade expansion act aimed
at elimination of many tariffs and
a gradual reduction of others. Ho
said the program would carry
safeguards for American produc
ers “to make certain that its bene
fits far outweigh any risks.”
The President renewed his plea
for programs stymied in the last
session medical care for the

aged under social security and
federal aid to public schools. He
said he would submit new pro
grams for college construction
and scholarships.

he said, the United States will be
cut off from its allies amid a
mounting economic offensive by
the Communists.

The President’s message, de
livered in person before a joint
session of the House and Senate,
was hailed by Democrats as a
model of world leadership and
criticized by Republicans as a
catalogue of inflationary and even
unconstitutional programs.
Republicans quickly denounced
one of his major domestic pro
posals—a request for presidential
authority , subject to a congres
sional veto, to lower personal in
come taxes within a specified
range and time when a recession
threatened.
KENNEDY SAID the idea
would be to "slow down an econ
omic decline before it has dragged
us down.” He sought the author
ity now, although the country is
on “the high road” out of the re
cent recession, because “the
time to repair the roof is when
the sun is shining.”
He also sought authority to
speed up such programs as re
clamation, flood control, irriga
tion and construction of urban
water and sewer systems in eco
nomic crises.

The President declared: “Our
nation is commissioned by history
to be an observer of freedom’s
failure or the cause of its suc
cess. Our overriding obligation in
the months ahead is to fulfill the
world’s hope by fulfilling our own
faith.”

HE PARTICUEAKEY sounded
this note in advising Congress
that he would submit a new five
year trade expansion act aimed
at elimination of many tariffs and
a gradual reduction of others. Ho
said the program would carry
safeguards for American produc
ers “to make certain that its bene
fits far outweigh any risks.”
The President renewed his plea
for programs stymied in the last
session medical care for the

aged under social security and
federal aid to public schools. He
said he would submit new pro
grams for college construction
and scholarships.
WASHINGTON (UPl»—Presi
dent Kennedy called on Congress
yesterday to let him cut taxes in
the face of any recession and to
lower tariffs as part of the Free
World’s economic battle against
Communism.

In a State of the Union message
that left Congress split along par
ty lines, the President appealed
for a host of foreign and domes
tic programs ranging from his
controversial medical care and
school plans to U.S. funds for the
United Nations.
WARNING that a cold war ar
mistice “seems very far away,” he
urged approval of a five-year tar
iff-cutting trade program so U.S.
producers can join Europes’ com
mon market manufacturers in “A
trading partnership.” Otherwise,
he said, the United States will be
cut off from its allies amid a
