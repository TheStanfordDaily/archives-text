IS STUDYING NECESSARY?
Once there were three roommates and their names were Walter
Pellucid, Casimir Fing, and Lelloy Holocaust and they were all
taking English lit. and they were all happy, friendly, outgoing
types and they all smoked Marlboro Cigarettes as you would
expect from such a gregarious trio, for Marlboro is the very es
sence of sociability, the very spirit of amity, and very soul of
concord, with its tobacco so mild and flavorful, its pack so
king-size and flip-top, its filter so pure and white, and you will
find when you smoke Marlboros that the world is filled with the
song of birds and no man's hand is raised against you.
Each night after dinner Walter and Casimir and Leßoy went
to their room and studied English lit. For three hours they sat
m sombre silence and pored over their books and then, squinty
and spent, they toppled onto their pallets and sobbed them
selves to sleep.
This joyless situation obtained all through the first semester.
Then one night they were all simultaneously struck by a mar
velous idea. “We are all studying the same thing,” they cried.
“Why, then, should each of us study for three hours? Why not
each study for one hour? It is true we will only learn one-third
as much that way, but it does not matter because there are
three of us and next June before the exams, we can get together
and pool our knowledge!”
Oh, what rapture then fell on Walter and Casimir and Leßoy!

They flung their beanies into the air ami danced a gavotte and
lit thirty or forty Marlboros and ran out to pursue the pleasure
which had so long, so bitterly, been missing from their lives.
Alas, they found instead a series of grisly misfortunes.
Walter, alas, went searching for love and was soon going steady
with a coed named Invicta Breadstuff, a handsome lass, but,
alas, hopelessly addicted to bowling. Each night she bowled’
five hundred lines, some nights a thousand. Poor Walter's
thumb was a shambles and his purse was empty, but Invicta
just kept on bowling and in the end, alas, she left Walter for a
pin-setter, which was a terrible thing to do to Walter, especially
in this case, because the pin-setter was automatic.
Walter, of course, was far too distraught to study his English
lit, but he took some comfort from the fact that his roommates
were studying and they would help him before the exams. But
Walter, alas, was wrong. His roommates, Casimir and Leßoy,
were nature lovers and they used their free time to go for long
tramps in the woods and one night, alas, they were treed by
two bears, Casimir by a brown bear and Leßoy by a kodiak,
and they were kept in the trees until spring set in and the
bears went to Yellowstone for the tourist season.
So when the three roommates met before exams to pool their
knowledge, they found they had none to pool! Well sir, they had
a good long laugh about that and then rushed to the kitchen
and stuck their heads in the oven. It was, however, an electric
oven and the effects were, on the whole, beneficial. The wax in
their ears got melted and they acquired a healthy tan and
today they are married to a lovely young heiress named (iang
lia Bran and live in the Canal Zone, where there arc? many nice
boats to wave at. ® im M «i sbutman

In case you worry about such things, their wife is a Marlboro
smoker, too, which adds to the general merriment. Marlboro
is übiquitous, as well as ttavorful, and you can buy them in
all .>0 slates as it'ell as the Canal Zone.
