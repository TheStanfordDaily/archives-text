IF TOBACCO COULD TALK (and who is certain it can’t?) it would beg to be placed
in Luckies. However, we would turn a deaf ear. Only tobacco that can prove its
worth will ever get in a Lucky. This may seem heartless —but it pays! Today,
college students smoke more Luckies than any other regular. We’d never be
able to make that statement if we listened to every slick-talking tobacco leaf that
tried to get into Luckies.
CHANGE TO LUCKIES and get some taste for a change!
