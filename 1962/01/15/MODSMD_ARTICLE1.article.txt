TJader, 36 years old, was born
in St. Louis, and came west to
San Jose State to be a teacher.
He doubled as a musician at night
in various San Francisco groups.
He turned down an offer from
Lionel Hampton to be a drummer
with his band to finish school, but
finally turned to music full-time
in 1948 when he joined the Bru
heek Trio.

IX 1950 he joined the George
Shearing Quintet as a vibraphon
ist. He recorded and composed
extensively during the period
until 1952 when he was awarded
the Down Beat New Star Award.

During his stay in the Shearing
Quintet, Tjader began working
with Afro-Cuban rhythmic forms.
When he formed his own group,
after leaving the Shearing Quin
tet, it was a mambo-jazz quintet,
with emphasis on mambo. In
1956 he reorganized the group
with a combination of Latin and
straight jazz.
Tjader credits such big names
as Lionel Hampton and Milt
Jackson with being the main in
fluences on his vibe playing.
TJADKK, who picked up the
vibes as a novelty when another
drummer left a set on a job, was
reared on swing bands like those
of Jimmy Lunceford and Count
Basie. He admires Art Tatum,
Teddy Wilson, Gene Krupa “for
his phrasing,” Philly Joe Jone,
Max Roach and John Lewis, pian
ist with the Modern Jazz Quartet,
“for his feeling, an art in itself.”
Of his own position in jazz,
Tjader says, “I’m not an innova
tor, I'm a participator. It’s all es
sentially a group effort. I believe
a group sound is almost more im
portant to make a band go over
than the individual improvising
talents of its members. Yet you
should play for yourself and be
happy in your playing. And
above all, whatever you do has to
swing!”
