WASHINGTON (UPI) Con
gress knuckles down to work to
day on the first legislative busi
ness of the new session with one
eye peeled for the fiscal 1963
budget that President Kennedy
will submit Thursday.
The Senate opens what prom
ises to be prolonged debate on
the so-called Du Pont bill. It is
designed to ease the tax and mar
ket impact of a court order re
quiring the Du Pont Company
to dispose of its General Motors
stock.

Leading the opposition to the
House-passed bill are Sens. Al
bert Gore, D-Tenn., and Paul H.
Douglas, D-111. They are taking
up where they left off last year
when the Senate adjourned with
the Du Pont measure the pending
item of business.
