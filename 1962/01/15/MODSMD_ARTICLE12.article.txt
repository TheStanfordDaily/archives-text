## Winds of Freedom' – Do They Really Blow? 
### JOHN KETCHUM 
One of my acquaintances sent
to President Sterling before his
recent speech the question, Do
(he winds of freedom really blow
at Stanford? This question, I am
told, did not roach the President;
one of his assistants rejected it
as being possibly offensive, and
passed instead such questions as,
How many Stanford graduates
become ditch-diggers?
This outright rejection of the
questions of sensitive and enquir
ing students, and the passage of
fatuous and vapid questions hav
ing nothing to do with the cen
tral problems of education might
permit us to answer my acquaint
ance’s question outright with a
resounding NO. But I should like
to go into the matter a little fur
ther, and try to shed some light
on the fundamental importance of
the question, Do the winds of
freedom really blow? —on the
basis of what President Sterling
actually said. There are four
main points of criticism:

1. Stanford is actively relin
quishing its role of intellectual
leadership. The President de
scribed in detail the results of
surveys which studied the occu
pations of college graduates, and
implied that the role of the unb
versity is to equip its graduates
to meet the demands of our pres
ent society.
OF COURSE THIS is far from
being false; but it Is not the pri
mary role of the university per
se. This role is the trusteeship of
higher learning— higher learning,
be it observed, and not simply
more knowledge. It may be that
the most important function of
the university in our time is to
produce articulate critics of the
very society in which it exists.

On the one hand, our society
demands highly trained special
ists capable of performing spe
cialized functions; but, on the
other hand, it is more than ever
before in need of a profound un
derstanding of the forces which
generate and direct these func
tions. This kind of understanding
is generated neither by special
ized education in, e.g., individual
areas of science or technology,
nor is it generated by specialized
studies in such fields as history
and sociology, especially when
the tacit aim of those latter fields,
no legs than the former, is to
produce trained specialists with
little time (and often little incli
nation as well) to study general
problems outside their fields. I
shall return to this point again in
my fourth criticism.
2. Stanford is first and fore
most a business, and only second
arily a university. The first half
of President Sterling’s speech
was devoted entirely to the prob
lems of marketing its product (its
graduates), and maintaining and
increasing itself as a fiscal enter
prise. It is true that he also
spoke of studies of curriculum re
vision—but to what end? What
constitutes a "better” education?
If the answer to this question is
intellectual freedom, how can this
freedom be achieved by the estab
lishment of any method or set of
programs whatsoever? Are not
the very ideas of freedom and
program in conflict with one an
other from the start?

I AM NOT inveighing here
against the authority of the fac
ulty; on the contrary: I am ar
guing for the exercise of authen
tic judgment on the part of fac
ulty and students alike, and I be
lieve that this Judgment can only
be formed by extensive study, of
the basic issues in each field, not
by the anthologized opinions built
into textbooks and supported
both by lack of critical independ
ent study and by the compulsive
factual dogmatism of the quarter
system. Above all, I am arguing
for the leisure and interest neces
sary to support this kind of in
formed conflict and dissent (a
quality almost entirely sup
pressed on the campus) outside
the classroom.

3. Stanford Is not a liberal arts
college. The President’s figures
speak for themselves; Stanford
sends 14 per cent of its graduates

into education, the national aver
age is 30 per cent; Stanford sends
6 per cent of its graduates into
humanistic studies, the national
average is 9 per cent. A little re
flection will show that the situa
tion is far more serious than the
simple percentages indicate. Sup
pose (to be generous) that there
are 20 colleges and universities in
the country which are “better”
than Stanford, and that there are
350 which are “worse.” The ma
jority of these institutions are
then “far worse” than Stanford,
but it is this group of institutions
which are supporting the liberal
tradition. There is no reason why
Stanford ought to be a liberal
arts college; it has a fine record
in engineering and science. But,
if Stanford is not going to be a
liberal arts college, it ought
frankly to call itself a technologi
cal institute not a university,
the meaning of which term is
barely understood and almost
never discussed.
4. PROGRAMS IN THE hu
manities will not solve the funda
mental problems at Stanford.
President Sterling recognized the
difficulties inherent in getting
funds for humanistic study at the
present time. (It would have
been enlightening to know how
much of the budget now supports
engineering, science, and humani
ties.) Surely this is one of Stan
ford’s most pressing problems.
But (he establishment of a formal
study of humanistic material is
very far from being a guarantee
of genuinely human thought and
human existence. We all know
humanistic scholars who are nar
row and near sighted, even as
technological in their orientation
as the most small-minded engi
neers, and we know engineers
and scientists who are leaders in
human thinking and are genuine
ly members of the public I'ealm.
No group of scholars and scien
tists in the Stanford community
is as aware of the problems of
human existence raised by our
technical prowess itself as the
medical community. Many of our
doctors do not share our society’s
naive optimism with respect to
the power of, technology at all.
One of them, Dr. L. J. Rather of
the Stanford Medical School,
writes:

“IF SEVERAL HUNDRED
years of devotion to the magic of
technique and the worship of the
naked deed have brought Western
man to his current mood of de
spair, to the recognition of a pro
gressively more severe estrange
ment from himself and his world,
to the bitter realization that his
central experience is one of dis
tance from everything that really
concerns him what is to be
done? Probably nothing. It is
not possible for Western man to
retrace his steps. . . . Barring a
catastrophe of immense propor
tions, the number of people to be
fed, clothed, and housed will
double in the lifetime of children
now alive. Only a huge technical
apparatus can care for these peo
ple. The answer, if there is one,
certainly cannot lie given in
terms of another scheme or pro
gram. Somehow man must trans
cend the skeletonized view of the
world, and of man himself, domi
nant today, in order to rediscover
the "Nature” of Goethe and the
“Lebenswelt” of Husserl. Wheth
er or not one attempts this task is
a question of individual decision,
and it is a matter of the greatest
fortuity whether it is possible at
all." (DIOGENES, No. 25, Spring
1959, p. 71. Bold face mine.)
I can only add to Dr. Rather’s
remarks, that if wo are to trans
cend the skeletonized view of the
world dominant today, we must
first recognize it; and if we are
going to recognize it, we must
heed the voice of those who have
studied and written about it; and
if we are going to heed these
writers, some of whom are
among the greatest philosophers
of our age, we must stop willfully
overlooking their works, and stop
structuring our fields of study in
such away that there is no place
for their comprehensive general
studies of man as man.
