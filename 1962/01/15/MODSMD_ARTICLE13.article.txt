HARVARD AT STANFORD?
Editor, The Daily:

The remarks of Classics Prof.
Charles R. Beye in last week's
ST&T discussions indicate that he
is anxious to make true the state
ment that Stanford is “the Har
vard of the West.” In fact, he
seems to want Stanford to be
something of a carbon copy of
Harvard.

Dr. Boye hinted in Friday’s
Daily that perhaps a system simi
lar to Harvard College within
Harvard University would be ben
eficial to Stanford. Then only the
men who graduated from “Stan
ford College” would be bona fide
“Stanford men.” This would give
Stanford “a distinct aura,” ac
cording to Dr. Beye. It would
also be contrary to the philoso
phy of Stanford University, for
Stanford has decided that all stu
dents, on every level, are “Stan
ford students.” Law or Business
School students ran take advan
tage of the same freedoms and
the same atmosphere that an un
dergraduate experiences. Why,
then, if it is so important, should
they not be considered “Stanford
students”?

Prof. Boye also assailed what
he called the “California attitude,
the lack of any conception of de
corum” among Stanford students.
It cannot be denied that some
times the proper social decorum
is lacking. Yet this “California
attitude,” the basic informality
among students, both in dress
and in behavior, is one of the
unique and essential freedoms of
Stanford life. It seems strange
that Dr. Beye should object to
this relatively free relationship
between students and between
students and faculty and yet call
for coffee shops "all over the
campus” where informal discus
sions could bo held.

“This is the second greatest
University in the United States.”
Dr. Beye was quoted as saying in
Thursday’s Daily. “Some day it
may be the greatest.” In working
toward this goal Stanford must
try to keep those qualities,
among which are its freedom and
its informality, which give it its
truly individual atmosphere. To
put Stanford on a par with Har
vard does not mean to make Stan
ford a West Coast copy of Har
vard.
Jeon Doble
Editor, The Daily:
Dr. Beye was reported in Thurs
day’s Daily to have said that,
“There is no place to talk at Stan
ford; no discussion takes place on
this campus.” Anyone who comes
from an institution or group in
which discussion is traditional
will quickly agree with the second
part of this statement but not the
first. We do have the Cellar. On
any sunny day the library lawn
serves as an ideal meeting ground.
The I-Center (seemingly ignored
by most of our student body)

provides a comfortable place to
take a study break (kill time) and
discuss anything from the weath
er to one’s Weltanschauung.
All of us living on campus are
in close, daily contact with the
other members of the living
group. We have lounges. We are
forced to face each other three
times a day at meals. There is
ample opportunity in both time
and space for discussion to flour
ish.

Even were there not, talking
would go on if the talkers simply
existed. Two people with the de
sire to discuss will discuss if they
have to sit in the gutter for lack
of a better location for the ac
tlvity.

But “No discussion takes place
on campus.” Why? The problem
lies, not in inadequate facilities or
programs, but in the people
Stanford students. They have lit
tle desire to exercise their minds
through contact with the ideas of
others. I think I speak for a small
but strong-feeling minority in ex
pressing disappointment in the
intellectual stimulation and at
mosphere at Stanford. I have
heard many state that they come
from public high schools with
more lively interest in the "intel
lectual ferment of our time” than
Stanford can claim. No amount
of spoonfed “places to talk” or
programs in living groups can
buck the social attitudes I have
thus far experienced here.
The problem needs more dras
tic solutions which can only come
from a thorough study of the fun
damental causes of the situation.

At the risk of blasphemy, I
might cautiously suggest that vve
may have to look back as far as
our office of admissions.

In Thursday’s Daily, Dr. Charles
Beye was quoted as saying:
“There is no place to talk at Stan
ford; no discussion takes place on
this campus. ... I don’t know
what Tresidder will be like, but I
can’t talk in a bowling alley—can

you?”
Dr. Beye thus stated a problem
with which the students and fac
ulty working on (he plans for
Trcsidder Memorial Union have
been concerned—the problem of
our non-existent facilities for in
formal gatherings. As one of
these students, 1 should like to
list a few of the facilities which
will be available in Tresidder next
fall, and which, it is hoped, will
help remedy this problem.
Large dining room,
Three small dining nooks,
New “Cellar” with booths,
Courtyard with conversational
groupings,
Terrace with conversational
groupings,
A largo lounge with fireplace,
Steinway piano, refreshment
facilities,
A small lounge with fireplace
and refreshment facilities,
Four meeting rooms with pro
jection booths,
Four small conference rooms,
Music lounge,
Small music-listening booths,
Art Prints room.

HOUSE PLANS
Editor, The Daily:
The statement of the House
Plan, like that of the Fundamen
tal Standard, is admittedly nebu
lous. The purposes are idealistic.
But those who are interested in
the practical applications of
ideals of the House Plan here be
lieve that the joining of the social
and the intellectual is natural and
inevitable—and desirable.

The basic idea is that a living
group should he more than a
comfortable, modern hotel in
which to eat, sleep, and study.
And it should be more than a
thriving social center whose only
justification for the excess time
it consumes is a phony sense of
prestige. Finally—idealistically—
it should provide an extension of
and a supplement to our class
room culture. Furthermore we
should not ask what the admin

istration is doing to bring this
about, but should ask what the
students are doing!
If the social and intellectual are
to be divorced, why should they
dwell under the common roof of
our resident campus?

Any person who seriously be
lieves in the great desirability of
avoiding nuclear war without the
sacrifice of traditional American
institutions would seem to be un
der the obligation of following an
effective course of action to es
tablish a secure peace when such
a course appeared. It seems un
likely that demonstrations,
marches, vigils, study groups, and
the like will convince anyone with
contrary or neutral opinions. Fur
thermore, such activities can have
little influence on national policy
since they offer no rational alter
natives to present policy and are

not directed In an effective man
ner toward the people responsible
for this policy.
Prof. Szilard has suggested a
plan which is specifically designed
to influence the administration in
the most effective way open to a
dedicated minority under our po
litical system. It could be very ef
fective indeed as the lobbying ac
tivities of such diverse organiza
tions as the AMA, (he oil inter

then, if it is so important, should
they not be considered “Stanford
students”?

Prof. Boye also assailed what
he called the “California attitude,
the lack of any conception of de
corum” among Stanford students.
It cannot be denied that some
times the proper social decorum
is lacking. Yet this “California
attitude,” the basic informality
among students, both in dress
and in behavior, is one of the
unique and essential freedoms of
Stanford life. It seems strange
that Dr. Beye should object to
this relatively free relationship
between students and between
students and faculty and yet call
for coffee shops "all over the
campus” where informal discus
sions could bo held.

“This is the second greatest
University in the United States.”
Dr. Beye was quoted as saying in
Thursday’s Daily. “Some day it
may be the greatest.” In working
toward this goal Stanford must
try to keep those qualities,
among which are its freedom and
its informality, which give it its
truly individual atmosphere. To
put Stanford on a par with Har
vard does not mean to make Stan
ford a West Coast copy of Har
vard.

Dr. Beye was reported in Thurs
day’s Daily to have said that,
“There is no place to talk at Stan
ford; no discussion takes place on
this campus.” Anyone who comes
from an institution or group in
which discussion is traditional
will quickly agree with the second
part of this statement but not the
first. We do have the Cellar. On
any sunny day the library lawn
serves as an ideal meeting ground.
The I-Center (seemingly ignored
by most of our student body)

provides a comfortable place to
take a study break (kill time) and
discuss anything from the weath
er to one’s Weltanschauung.
All of us living on campus are
in close, daily contact with the
other members of the living
group. We have lounges. We are
forced to face each other three
times a day at meals. There is
ample opportunity in both time
and space for discussion to flour
ish.

Even were there not, talking
would go on if the talkers simply
existed. Two people with the de
sire to discuss will discuss if they
have to sit in the gutter for lack
of a better location for the ac
tlvity.

But “No discussion takes place
on campus.” Why? The problem
lies, not in inadequate facilities or
programs, but in the people
Stanford students. They have lit
tle desire to exercise their minds
through contact with the ideas of
others. I think I speak for a small
but strong-feeling minority in ex
pressing disappointment in the
intellectual stimulation and at
mosphere at Stanford. I have
heard many state that they come
from public high schools with
more lively interest in the "intel
lectual ferment of our time” than
Stanford can claim. No amount
of spoonfed “places to talk” or
programs in living groups can
buck the social attitudes I have
thus far experienced here.
The problem needs more dras
tic solutions which can only come
from a thorough study of the fun
damental causes of the situation.

At the risk of blasphemy, I
might cautiously suggest that vve
may have to look back as far as
our office of admissions.

HOUSE PLANS
Editor, The Daily:
The statement of the House
Plan, like that of the Fundamen
tal Standard, is admittedly nebu
lous. The purposes are idealistic.
But those who are interested in
the practical applications of
ideals of the House Plan here be
lieve that the joining of the social
and the intellectual is natural and
inevitable—and desirable.

The basic idea is that a living
group should he more than a
comfortable, modern hotel in
which to eat, sleep, and study.
And it should be more than a
thriving social center whose only
justification for the excess time
it consumes is a phony sense of
prestige. Finally—idealistically—
it should provide an extension of
and a supplement to our class
room culture. Furthermore we
should not ask what the admin

istration is doing to bring this
about, but should ask what the
students are doing!
If the social and intellectual are
to be divorced, why should they
dwell under the common roof of

HARVARD AT STANFORD?
Editor, The Daily:

The remarks of Classics Prof.
Charles R. Beye in last week's
ST&T discussions indicate that he
is anxious to make true the state
ment that Stanford is “the Har
vard of the West.” In fact, he
seems to want Stanford to be
something of a carbon copy of
Harvard.

Dr. Boye hinted in Friday’s
Daily that perhaps a system simi
lar to Harvard College within
Harvard University would be ben
eficial to Stanford. Then only the
men who graduated from “Stan
ford College” would be bona fide
“Stanford men.” This would give
Stanford “a distinct aura,” ac
cording to Dr. Beye. It would
also be contrary to the philoso
phy of Stanford University, for
Stanford has decided that all stu
dents, on every level, are “Stan
ford students.” Law or Business
School students ran take advan
tage of the same freedoms and
the same atmosphere that an un
dergraduate experiences. Why,
then, if it is so important, should
they not be considered “Stanford
students”?

Dr. Beye was reported in Thurs
day’s Daily to have said that,
“There is no place to talk at Stan
ford; no discussion takes place on
this campus.” Anyone who comes
from an institution or group in
which discussion is traditional
will quickly agree with the second
part of this statement but not the
first. We do have the Cellar. On
any sunny day the library lawn
serves as an ideal meeting ground.
The I-Center (seemingly ignored
by most of our student body)

provides a comfortable place to
take a study break (kill time) and
discuss anything from the weath
er to one’s Weltanschauung.
All of us living on campus are
in close, daily contact with the
other members of the living
group. We have lounges. We are
forced to face each other three
times a day at meals. There is
ample opportunity in both time
and space for discussion to flour
ish.

Even were there not, talking
would go on if the talkers simply
existed. Two people with the de
sire to discuss will discuss if they
have to sit in the gutter for lack
of a better location for the ac
tlvity.

But “No discussion takes place
on campus.” Why? The problem
lies, not in inadequate facilities or
programs, but in the people
Stanford students. They have lit
tle desire to exercise their minds
through contact with the ideas of
others. I think I speak for a small
but strong-feeling minority in ex
pressing disappointment in the
intellectual stimulation and at
mosphere at Stanford. I have
heard many state that they come
from public high schools with
more lively interest in the "intel
lectual ferment of our time” than
Stanford can claim. No amount
of spoonfed “places to talk” or
programs in living groups can
buck the social attitudes I have
thus far experienced here.
The problem needs more dras
tic solutions which can only come
from a thorough study of the fun
damental causes of the situation.

At the risk of blasphemy, I
might cautiously suggest that vve
may have to look back as far as
our office of admissions.

HOUSE PLANS
Editor, The Daily:
The statement of the House
Plan, like that of the Fundamen
tal Standard, is admittedly nebu
lous. The purposes are idealistic.
But those who are interested in
the practical applications of
ideals of the House Plan here be
lieve that the joining of the social
and the intellectual is natural and
inevitable—and desirable.

The basic idea is that a living
group should he more than a
comfortable, modern hotel in
which to eat, sleep, and study.
And it should be more than a
thriving social center whose only
justification for the excess time
it consumes is a phony sense of
prestige. Finally—idealistically—
it should provide an extension of
and a supplement to our class
room culture. Furthermore we
should not ask what the admin

istration is doing to bring this
about, but should ask what the
students are doing!
If the social and intellectual are
to be divorced, why should they
dwell under the common roof of
our resident campus?

HARVARD AT STANFORD?
Editor, The Daily:

The remarks of Classics Prof.
Charles R. Beye in last week's
ST&T discussions indicate that he
is anxious to make true the state
ment that Stanford is “the Har
vard of the West.” In fact, he
seems to want Stanford to be
something of a carbon copy of
Harvard.

Dr. Boye hinted in Friday’s
Daily that perhaps a system simi
lar to Harvard College within
Harvard University would be ben
eficial to Stanford. Then only the
men who graduated from “Stan
ford College” would be bona fide
“Stanford men.” This would give
Stanford “a distinct aura,” ac
cording to Dr. Beye. It would
also be contrary to the philoso
phy of Stanford University, for
Stanford has decided that all stu
dents, on every level, are “Stan
ford students.” Law or Business
School students ran take advan
tage of the same freedoms and
the same atmosphere that an un
dergraduate experiences. Why,
then, if it is so important, should
they not be considered “Stanford
students”?

Prof. Boye also assailed what
he called the “California attitude,
the lack of any conception of de
corum” among Stanford students.
It cannot be denied that some
times the proper social decorum
is lacking. Yet this “California
attitude,” the basic informality
among students, both in dress
and in behavior, is one of the
unique and essential freedoms of
Stanford life. It seems strange
that Dr. Beye should object to
this relatively free relationship
between students and between
students and faculty and yet call
for coffee shops "all over the
campus” where informal discus
sions could bo held.

“This is the second greatest
University in the United States.”
Dr. Beye was quoted as saying in
Thursday’s Daily. “Some day it
may be the greatest.” In working
toward this goal Stanford must
try to keep those qualities,
among which are its freedom and
its informality, which give it its

on campus.” Why? The problem
lies, not in inadequate facilities or

Stanford students. They have lit

others. I think I speak for a small

pressing disappointment in the
intellectual stimulation and at
mosphere at Stanford. I have
heard many state that they come
from public high schools with
more lively interest in the "intel
lectual ferment of our time” than
Stanford can claim. No amount
of spoonfed “places to talk” or
programs in living groups can
buck the social attitudes I have
thus far experienced here.
The problem needs more dras

HOUSE PLANS
Editor, The Daily:
The statement of the House
Plan, like that of the Fundamen
tal Standard, is admittedly nebu
lous. The purposes are idealistic.
But those who are interested in
the practical applications of
ideals of the House Plan here be
lieve that the joining of the social
and the intellectual is natural and
inevitable—and desirable.

The basic idea is that a living
group should he more than a
comfortable, modern hotel in
which to eat, sleep, and study.
And it should be more than a
thriving social center whose only
justification for the excess time
it consumes is a phony sense of
prestige. Finally—idealistically—
it should provide an extension of
and a supplement to our class
room culture. Furthermore we
should not ask what the admin

istration is doing to bring this
about, but should ask what the
students are doing!
If the social and intellectual are
to be divorced, why should they
dwell under the common roof of
our resident campus?

HARVARD AT STANFORD?
Editor, The Daily:

The remarks of Classics Prof.
Charles R. Beye in last week's
ST&T discussions indicate that he
is anxious to make true the state
ment that Stanford is “the Har
vard of the West.” In fact, he
seems to want Stanford to be
something of a carbon copy of
Harvard.

Dr. Boye hinted in Friday’s
Daily that perhaps a system simi
lar to Harvard College within
Harvard University would be ben
eficial to Stanford. Then only the
men who graduated from “Stan
ford College” would be bona fide
“Stanford men.” This would give
Stanford “a distinct aura,” ac
cording to Dr. Beye. It would
also be contrary to the philoso
phy of Stanford University, for
Stanford has decided that all stu
dents, on every level, are “Stan
ford students.” Law or Business
School students ran take advan
tage of the same freedoms and
the same atmosphere that an un
dergraduate experiences. Why,
then, if it is so important, should
they not be considered “Stanford
students”?

Prof. Boye also assailed what
he called the “California attitude,
the lack of any conception of de
corum” among Stanford students.
It cannot be denied that some
times the proper social decorum
is lacking. Yet this “California
attitude,” the basic informality
among students, both in dress
and in behavior, is one of the
unique and essential freedoms of
Stanford life. It seems strange
that Dr. Beye should object to
this relatively free relationship
between students and between
students and faculty and yet call
for coffee shops "all over the
campus” where informal discus
sions could bo held.

“This is the second greatest
University in the United States.”
Dr. Beye was quoted as saying in
Thursday’s Daily. “Some day it
may be the greatest.” In working
toward this goal Stanford must
try to keep those qualities,
among which are its freedom and
its informality, which give it its
truly individual atmosphere. To
put Stanford on a par with Har
vard does not mean to make Stan
ford a West Coast copy of Har
vard.

buck the social attitudes I have
thus far experienced here.
The problem needs more dras
tic solutions which can only come
from a thorough study of the fun
damental causes of the situation.

At the risk of blasphemy, I
might cautiously suggest that vve
may have to look back as far as
our office of admissions.

Editor, The Daily;
In Thursday’s Daily, Dr. Charles
Beye was quoted as saying:
“There is no place to talk at Stan
ford; no discussion takes place on
this campus. ... I don’t know
what Tresidder will be like, but I
can’t talk in a bowling alley—can

you?”
Dr. Beye thus stated a problem
with which the students and fac
ulty working on (he plans for
Trcsidder Memorial Union have
been concerned—the problem of
our non-existent facilities for in
formal gatherings. As one of
these students, 1 should like to
list a few of the facilities which
will be available in Tresidder next
fall, and which, it is hoped, will
help remedy this problem.
Large dining room,
Three small dining nooks,
New “Cellar” with booths,
Courtyard with conversational
groupings,
Terrace with conversational
groupings,
A largo lounge with fireplace,
Steinway piano, refreshment
facilities,
A small lounge with fireplace
and refreshment facilities,
Four meeting rooms with pro
jection booths,
Four small conference rooms,
Music lounge,
Small music-listening booths,
Art Prints room.
Browsing room.

HOUSE PLANS
Editor, The Daily:
The statement of the House
Plan, like that of the Fundamen
tal Standard, is admittedly nebu
lous. The purposes are idealistic.
But those who are interested in
the practical applications of
ideals of the House Plan here be
lieve that the joining of the social
and the intellectual is natural and
inevitable—and desirable.

The basic idea is that a living
group should he more than a
comfortable, modern hotel in
which to eat, sleep, and study.
And it should be more than a
thriving social center whose only
justification for the excess time
it consumes is a phony sense of
prestige. Finally—idealistically—
it should provide an extension of
and a supplement to our class
room culture. Furthermore we
should not ask what the admin

istration is doing to bring this
about, but should ask what the
students are doing!
If the social and intellectual are
to be divorced, why should they
dwell under the common roof of
our resident campus?

SZILARD PL AX
Editor, The Daily;
Any person who seriously be
lieves in the great desirability of
avoiding nuclear war without the
sacrifice of traditional American
institutions would seem to be un
der the obligation of following an
effective course of action to es
tablish a secure peace when such
a course appeared. It seems un
likely that demonstrations,
marches, vigils, study groups, and
the like will convince anyone with
contrary or neutral opinions. Fur
thermore, such activities can have
little influence on national policy
since they offer no rational alter
natives to present policy and are

not directed In an effective man
ner toward the people responsible
for this policy.
Prof. Szilard has suggested a
plan which is specifically designed
to influence the administration in
the most effective way open to a
dedicated minority under our po
litical system. It could be very ef
fective indeed as the lobbying ac
tivities of such diverse organiza
tions as the AMA, (he oil inter
ests, and the NAACP have shown.
Prof. Szilard’s experiment de
serves the attention and support
of all concerned Individuals
