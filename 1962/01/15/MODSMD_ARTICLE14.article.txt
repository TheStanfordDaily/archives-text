# Indians Down Bears in Basketball... and Rugby
## Windsor Knots Golden Bears; Scores 20 
### CHUCK BISCHOFF 
Darroll Sutherland, John Wind
sor, and company smashed the
California Bears 74-42 Friday
night, anil made it look easy. The
Cards, in running up the largest
margin of victory in the 151
games between the two teams,
got outstanding performances
from almost every team member,
Sutherland started the fire
works with five perfect buckets
from outside in the first 5:30 of
play while the Stanfords ran up
a commanding 15-3 margin. The
string-bean junior guard showed
the form that made him CIF
Player of the Year in high school
as he sparked the Indians to a
36-22 half-time margin and de
moralized the hapless Bears.
FA I N MORE CRUCIAL, how
ever, was the play of big John
Windsor, who took charge of the
team after Sutherland, Hollis
Moore, and Tom Dose had all
been benched with four fouls
each in a single horrible two-min
ute period of whistle-tooting early
in second half.
With 14:03 left to play, a 12-
point margin, and three regulars
on the bench, the situation might
have been dangerous. But Wind
sor hit on two jumpers, two lay
ins, and two free throws in one
furious three-minute stretch to
give the Cards a 54-34 lead and
put the game out of reach.
WHEN WINDSOR too was
whistled for the fourth time three
minutes later, Coach Howie Dall
mar cleared the bench and Mike

Ledgerwood, Doug Clemetson,
Bob Sommers, Jim Bryan, and
Phil Kelly ran the margin up to
a record 32. Third-stringers Fred
Pegelow and Chris Babbs broke
into the scoring column too, as
the reserves piled it on.
The victory, ninth in a row and
first in AAWU play for Stanford,

was truly a team effort. Cal con
centrated on defenslng Tom Dose,
and they succeeded in that if
nothing else. But at the same
time Windsor and Sutherland
were left wide open, and both
were hot, so there was no need
to even try to pass it in to big
Tom..

Dose’s contribution to the vic
tory was not inconsiderable, how
ever, as he controlled the defen
sive backboard almost single
handedly in the first half, and
chalked up 11 rebounds although
playing barely half the game.
ANOTHER CONTRIBUTION
which should not be overlooked
was that of Don Clemetson, (he
classy guard who dueled with
Cal’s Denny Lewis in the back
court and set up numerous scores
as well as dropping in 11 points
himself.
The Stanfords hit a blazing
49.2 per cent on 31 out of 63
field goals, with an even better
53.6 per cent in the second half.
Sutherland led the way with 8 for
12, mostly lumpers of 20 feet or
more. Windsor was right behind
with 9 out of 14 buckets.
Indian control of both back
boards was also pronounced, as
the Cards garnered 50 rebounds
to 32 for their opponents. Com
pleting the domination, the Cards
lost the ball only seven times on
misplays in contrast to 12 for Cal.
IN SHORT, Stanford beat Cal
by a wide margin in every de
partment. It was a victory of the
most solid variety, and an omen
of good things to come.

Tom..

Dose’s contribution to the vic
tory was not inconsiderable, how
ever, as he controlled the defen
sive backboard almost single
handedly in the first half, and
chalked up 11 rebounds although
playing barely half the game.
ANOTHER CONTRIBUTION
which should not be overlooked
was that of Don Clemetson, (he
classy guard who dueled with
Cal’s Denny Lewis in the back
court and set up numerous scores
as well as dropping in 11 points
himself.
The Stanfords hit a blazing
49.2 per cent on 31 out of 63
field goals, with an even better
53.6 per cent in the second half.
Sutherland led the way with 8 for
12, mostly lumpers of 20 feet or
more. Windsor was right behind
with 9 out of 14 buckets.
Indian control of both back
boards was also pronounced, as
the Cards garnered 50 rebounds
to 32 for their opponents. Com
pleting the domination, the Cards
lost the ball only seven times on
misplays in contrast to 12 for Cal.
IN SHORT, Stanford beat Cal
by a wide margin in every de
partment. It was a victory of the
most solid variety, and an omen
of good things to come.

DARRELL SUTHERLAND (41) takes a jump shot for Stanford over the
guard of Bear Don Lauer (30) and scores in the early minutes of the
the Stanford-Cal basketball game Friday night.
Darroll Sutherland, John Wind
sor, and company smashed the
California Bears 74-42 Friday
night, anil made it look easy. The
Cards, in running up the largest
margin of victory in the 151
games between the two teams,
got outstanding performances
from almost every team member,
Sutherland started the fire
works with five perfect buckets
from outside in the first 5:30 of
play while the Stanfords ran up
a commanding 15-3 margin. The
string-bean junior guard showed
the form that made him CIF
Player of the Year in high school
as he sparked the Indians to a
36-22 half-time margin and de
moralized the hapless Bears.
FA I N MORE CRUCIAL, how
ever, was the play of big John
Windsor, who took charge of the
team after Sutherland, Hollis
Moore, and Tom Dose had all
been benched with four fouls
each in a single horrible two-min
ute period of whistle-tooting early
in second half.
With 14:03 left to play, a 12-
point margin, and three regulars
on the bench, the situation might
have been dangerous. But Wind
sor hit on two jumpers, two lay
ins, and two free throws in one
furious three-minute stretch to
give the Cards a 54-34 lead and
put the game out of reach.
WHEN WINDSOR too was
whistled for the fourth time three
minutes later, Coach Howie Dall
mar cleared the bench and Mike

Ledgerwood, Doug Clemetson,
Bob Sommers, Jim Bryan, and
Phil Kelly ran the margin up to
a record 32. Third-stringers Fred
Pegelow and Chris Babbs broke
into the scoring column too, as
the reserves piled it on.
The victory, ninth in a row and
first in AAWU play for Stanford,

was truly a team effort. Cal con
centrated on defenslng Tom Dose,
and they succeeded in that if
nothing else. But at the same
time Windsor and Sutherland
were left wide open, and both
were hot, so there was no need
to even try to pass it in to big
Tom..
