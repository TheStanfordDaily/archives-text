## Unbeaten Papooses Loose First As Cal Bearcubs Win 58-47 
### TOM PARKER 
The Stanford frosh had to give
up hopes for an undefeated sea
son this Friday, as the invading
frosh Bears from the University
of California cut the Papoose rec
ord to four wins and one loss,
and boosted their own record to
12 wins. The Bears rumbled over
the junior Card hoopsters, 58-47.
The Indian attack, a weak one
compared to other frosh games
this season, wasn’t sparked by
any one player. Forward Bob
Garner, the game’s high scorer
for Stanford, made the first Stan
ford field goal, following a shot
missed by guard Dick Ragsdale.
Then center John Murray scored,
followed again by Garner. Rags
dale hit for two consecutive buck
ets on drives down the middle.
ALL WELL AND GOOD, but
as the frosh scored their first
eight points, the Cubs had also
scored eight. The game was close
to a tie until well into the middle
of the first half.
After Craig Cordes scored on a
shot from the side to tie the score
21-21, the Cal squad, led by the
accurate shooting of Bob Tanen
baum, went ahead with seven
quick points, taking the lead they
were not to lose for the remain
der of the game.
At the half Cal was leading 34-
28, when center Mike Henderson
dunked the ball in the Cal hoop
in the last seconds of play.
AT THE BEGINNING of the
second half, it looked as though

the junior Cards might just take
it. They pulled up to a four-point
difference, but Cal’s Henderson
and Tanenbaum seemed to be too
much for the Stanford five.
Finally, late in the last half,
Stanford crept to a three ■ point
difference, but Cal rallied for a
quick eight points and finished
off the Stanford team, 58-47.
HENDERSON and Tanenbaum
scored high for the Cubs, Hender
son with 22 and Tanenbaum with
21.
Garner was the Stanford high
scorer with 11 points, followed by
Murray and Jack Gilbert with 10.

missed by guard Dick Ragsdale.
Then center John Murray scored,
followed again by Garner. Rags
dale hit for two consecutive buck
ets on drives down the middle.
ALL WELL AND GOOD, but
as the frosh scored their first
eight points, the Cubs had also
scored eight. The game was close
to a tie until well into the middle
of the first half.
After Craig Cordes scored on a
shot from the side to tie the score
21-21, the Cal squad, led by the
accurate shooting of Bob Tanen
baum, went ahead with seven
quick points, taking the lead they
were not to lose for the remain
der of the game.
At the half Cal was leading 34-
28, when center Mike Henderson
dunked the ball in the Cal hoop
in the last seconds of play.
AT THE BEGINNING of the
second half, it looked as though

the junior Cards might just take
it. They pulled up to a four-point
difference, but Cal’s Henderson
and Tanenbaum seemed to be too
much for the Stanford five.
Finally, late in the last half,
Stanford crept to a three ■ point
difference, but Cal rallied for a
quick eight points and finished
off the Stanford team, 58-47.
HENDERSON and Tanenbaum
scored high for the Cubs, Hender
son with 22 and Tanenbaum with
21.
Garner was the Stanford high
scorer with 11 points, followed by
Murray and Jack Gilbert with 10.

FRESHMAN CENTER John Murray (55) clears a rebound for the Stan
ford Frosh against the California Bearcubs Friday night. Stanford
player in the background is guard Rod Young (11). California de
feated the Indians 58-47.
The Stanford frosh had to give
up hopes for an undefeated sea
son this Friday, as the invading
frosh Bears from the University
of California cut the Papoose rec
ord to four wins and one loss,
and boosted their own record to
12 wins. The Bears rumbled over
the junior Card hoopsters, 58-47.
The Indian attack, a weak one
compared to other frosh games
this season, wasn’t sparked by
any one player. Forward Bob
Garner, the game’s high scorer
for Stanford, made the first Stan
ford field goal, following a shot
missed by guard Dick Ragsdale.
