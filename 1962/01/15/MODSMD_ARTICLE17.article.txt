# Card Ruggers Down Cal 13-8
## 
### ART ROBINSON 
Stanford’s varsity rugby team
started their 1962 season off with
a resounding win as the Card
ruggers trounced a good Califor
nia Bear squad, 13-8, at Cal’s Me
morial Stadium Saturday.
The Tribe scored two goals (try
and conversion) in the first half
of the contest to take a 10-0 inter
mission time lead and was never
headed on its way to victory in
the first match of the season.
THE INDIANS’ first score
came with only seven minutes
gone in the opening period on a
55-yard passing rush play. Cali
fornia won the pigskin on a line
out, and one of the Bear forwards
kicked a short punt just past mid
field where the ball was picked
up by Card first 5/8 Tom Mc-
Manus.

McManus passed over 1o Stan
Lindskog, who raced downfield
for 35 yards before lateral!ng
to Hooker John Thomas, who
plunged the last yards past the
goal line and touched the ball
down for a try.
Lindskog then booled the con
version to make the score 50 for
the Indian rugbymen.
STANFORD’S SECOND goal
came just before the half ended
on one of the best plays of the
day. Second 5/8 Hal Steuber
came up with the ball after a
loose scrum and took off down
field, but, fenced in by some Bear
defense men. the canny Card
kicked a short pop kick to him

self and continued unscathed.
Stanford sewed up the contest
midway through the second half,
when the ever present Lindskog
placed a 30 - yard penalty kick
squarely through the uprights to
give Pete Kmetovic’s ruggers an
insurmountable 13-0 lead.
Finally Steuber was forced to
pass across the field to Lindskog
on the sidelines, who tossed the
ball off to Chuck Cobb to enable
the fleet wing to fly into scoring
territory, the whole play cover
ing 60 yards.
As the gun sounded to end the
first - half play, Lindskog added
the conversion to give the Tribe a
10-0 bulge.
CALIFORNIA’S first-half play
was characterized by several
missed penalty kicks, with Brian
Reid and Jess Pittore sharing the
kicking duty, but neither one be
ing very successful.

The Bears’ Jim Burress also
contributed some fine running
from his wing position, including
one nifty 40-yard dash that al
most ended up as a Berkeley try,
before the Card defense pulled
him down 10 yards in front of the
goal.
COACH MILES HUDSON’S

Bears evaded a potential shutout,
when Cal’s Pit tore finally made a
successful penalty kick, after four
previous failures, to put Cal on
the scoreboard with three points.

Cal’s last score was a try by
Fred Tuemmler, who squirmed
over the goal after Burress had
brought the ball down close to
the scoring zone, and the conver
sion by Pittore.

The Golden Bears had one oth
er scoring opportunity early in
the second period. The Cal for
wards managed to push the ball
across (he goal line, hut were un
able to touch it down when the
Indians stole the hall.

Kmetovic was especially
pleased with the play of his
scrum, noting that they needed
only a little work on liming in
getting the ball out to the backs.
FORWARDS Troy Barbee, AI

Hildebrand, and Butler all name
in for praise by the Card coarh,
as did McManus for his backfielct
work.

Stanford’s JV ruggers didn’t
fare so will as their varsity coun
terparts as they lost a 11-3 deci
sion to the Cal JV’s.
